B0029ZA3H4|5.0|I read this book for kindle.  I found Crush IT to be very insightful.  The internet is a complete game changer for all companies large or small, local and global.  Gary introduces some concepts that are out of the scope of most people doing marketing. I specifically like all the talk about your personal brand.  In the age of YouTube and picture sharing services, your personal brand is constantly under scrutiny.  I think most business' could take a page out of Gary's play book, and increase their effectiveness several fold.

B002VECM72|5.0|Sandra Bullock is to be commended for her performance in The Blindside...an opinion shared by others as evidenced by her Oscar for the role. The entire cast (including the cameos by the coaches)made for an enjoyable story of just how the faith of a good person can make a seemingly hopeless situation hope fulfilled! Our cynical, superficial world (an aspect not ignored in the film) sometimes needs its attention drawn to how really walking the walk instead of just talking the talk can bring unforeseen benefits to the quality of our co-existence as human beings.  I REALLY don't care for movies with some self appointed someone's idea of what's good or bad with our society...this movie is very different in that it is a true story, at least as true as Hollywood ever makes a film (a rare occurrence). Thumbs up on this film and all those associated with its production.
0060935464|5.0|This book I believe all cultures should read, it is a very touching story. Harper Lee is a great writer, I can see why she was awarded the Pulitzer Prize.    The Story takes place in the State of Alabama. The Girl who narrates the story is very smart and also strong, I admired her capabilties along with her brother Jem. They take you on adventures throughout the whole book.    The plot takes place during the Great Depression. Scout and Jem stand up for their dad Aticus who is a lawyer in the town called Maycomb. Their dad is defending a black man whose name is Tom Robinson, he was accused of raping a young white girl. There is alot of history in this book.     This is a must read book it has alot of meaning throughout the whole story, you will not want to put it down, a must read !!!
B0030Y11XS|1.0|Michael Moore's latest attack on Western society opens with surveillance video of bank robberies in progress where the thieves are seen kissing the money... while a song bashing capitalism is played in the background. I get it - it's a metaphor. It's a lousy metaphor... and it goes south from there.<br /><br />A 1950s education reel follows, narrating the history of the Roman Empire. When mention of despots, embarrassment, etc. are mentioned, the film quickly chops in film footage of Cheney and/or George W. Bush. I will say one thing for Moore (actually, I will say several)... he isn't hiding how he feels.<br /><br />This is a sheep feed film. This is the type of film you show to sheep who already buy into the message - it's the perfect diet of 'hate the establishment' with a side order of 'the man is putting us down' and a heaping helping of socialism. It's a great film to indoctrinate young, impressionable minds that are hypnotized into thinking they're thinking for themselves, when all they are doing is being good zombie goons for the left.<br /><br />From the first four minutes of the film, I started getting nauseated... probably vertigo induced from non-stop eye rolling on my part.<br /><br />Next, we see well-edited video of foreclosures... anyone can be sympathetic. Your heart pounds as the sheriff bangs on the door and finally breaks the doorjamb to force the former owners out of the house. You think of how terrifying it would be to be forced out of your home. This is not Nazi Germany where the government comes to your house and relocates you because of your heritage or political stance - this is America. If you buy a house you cannot afford and fail to make payments, you are defaulted on your loan and you have to move. No one is going to kill you. Even in a bad economy, America is the land of opportunity. Living cheaply and sensibly can keep a roof over anyone's head. Bad things happen to good people, but only 8 minutes into the movie a man proposes that those with little will have to rise up to take what belongs to those who are affluent. Look out, Michael Moore, they're gonna come after your millions, too!<br /><br />While it's sad to see people lose everything - material things, anyway, there are consequences to actions. If you lose a job and can't find one, you can live on your savings while you look for other avenues to survive instead of waiting until they are coming to kick you out. The people here have lots of things they spent money on - things they didn't necessarily need, money that went to dust catchers instead of savings. Now they pout and whine about how people are taking advantage of them instead of picking themselves up by their bootstraps and taking advantage of our capitalistic way of life - where the world is your oyster if you will simply work and work hard.<br /><br />Moore says, \\"this is capitalism: a system of giving and taking - mostly taking.\\" Moore is certainly free to his opinion, even if it's asinine.<br /><br />Moore either suffers from the delusion or simply exploits it... the delusion that capitalism and greed are synonyms. Clearly by Moore's figure, he is one that never got the concept of \\"eat the meat and spit out the bones.\\" He's gone beyond throwing the baby out with the bath water - he wants to hold the baby under until it drowns, decomposes and finally is indistinguishable from the bathwater. He blames America's success because America obliterated the competition in the bombings of Germany and Japan during World War II. A reminder to Moore - America was dragged into the war. Had American not ended the war, Moore would be speaking German or Japanese right now, and not enjoying the freedom that capitalism offers him.<br /><br />The recurring motif is - every time some one becomes successful in America, a kitten dies.<br /><br />The greed of corporate America is Ronald Reagan's fault, too... just in case you missed the memo.<br /><br />When highlighting the corruption by a crooked judge and entrepreneur, who both went to prison for committing their crimes, Moore states that capitalism defeated democracy. No - criminals broke the law and innocent people were hurt. The criminals exploited the system, and innocent people were hurt. That's life. Capitalism is not the villain here.<br /><br />What's sad is that Moore is an able filmmaker. In this film, he exposes a jaw-dropping scam in which companies take out life insurance policies on their employees without their knowledge or consent... yet he links this as a problem with capitalism. This is like blaming ice cream companies for obesity. The problem is corporate greed and malfeasance. I'd like Moore to make a film just on this one scam - he could really blow the lid off this problem and expose it to the light - but no, he would rather demonize the American way of life because he is blinded by his hatred for Bush, Reagan and anyone other than him making obscene profits.... unless of course, they're paying 90% in tax.<br /><br />Moore is an apt storyteller, even if his stories are only 10% truth.<br /><br />Big shock... in the end, the Messiah of this tale is B. Hussein Obama. Remember Obama's discussion with Joe the Plumber, in which he says he wants to \\"spread the wealth\\"? The same conversation that Obama later tap-danced around? Moore shows it as a virtue - that socialism (whether or not you call it that or not) is the cure for the disease he calls capitalism. Taking the role of John the Baptist is FDR.<br /><br />What I'm always fascinated with is why these rabid socialists today, like Moore, choose to live here instead of living in North Korea, China. Cuba or Ethiopia. Oh yeah - it's because socialism has turned those countries in to heaps of starving nothing. No innovation, no food, and no freedom. The neo-commies like Moore want the God-less Utopia that socialism promises (but never delivers), but without giving up on THEIR freedom to say what they want, without giving up on iPods and other innovations that capitalism gives them, without giving up an infrastructure of highways, sewage control. They want all the promises that socialism claims to offer, but they want the freedom capitalism gives them ... even though the two are incompatible.<br /><br />In the end, Moore states in his narration, \\"I refuse to live in a country like this... and I'm not leaving.\\" Be afraid. Be very afraid. There are others that buy into this drivel and they vote (sometimes more than once) and sit on juries.states that capitalism defeated democracy.

1402726899|5.0|My Iyengar yoga teacher told me about this book and I am so glad he did.  It was exactly what I wished I had found earlier in my pregnancy.  It is NOT specific to Iyengar yoga, either.  If you practice yoga and want to continue to do so during conception, pregnancy, labor, and after, then this book will tell you which poses are okay for which trimester and which ones are not.  Also how to modify common poses.  There are recommended sequences for practice at home.  The only drawback is that some of the poses rely on using a lot of equipment that you absolutely would not have at home--trestle, some crazy back-bending table, ropes hanging from ceilings.  But this is not true of all the poses.  I bought two blocks, a strap, a wedge, yoga ball, and a bolster and feel like I can do a lot of the poses on my own.  I also think these props will be helpful during early labor at home.  With this book, I am able, at 7 mos. pregnant, to continue in a Level 1/2 class with confidence!
0061703257|4.0|A creepy insane asylum on an isolated island. A patient who mysteriously vanishes. Staff and doctors who seem to know more than they are saying. A hurricane that cuts off communication and any way back to the mainland. You've heard it all before. Cue the axe-welding murderer to dispatch characters in increasingly gruesome ways!<br /><br />But wait. This isn't the plot for the next slasher movie. It's a thriller that (dare I say it?) goes for the mind instead of the gut. Despite all the trappings of a third-rate thriller, Dennis Lehane has penned a novel that makes you think ... and the thinking goes on long after you've closed the book.<br /><br />U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels and his new partner are sent to find out how a female inmate managed to escaped from her locked cell. That's only part of the mystery that shrouds the island like fog. The novel, set in the early '50s, brings much more to the table than a simple mystery. There's the Cold War, the lingering effects of World War II on the men who fought it and then returned home, the horrors of the Nazi death camps and medical \\"experiments,\\" the history of psychiatry which was then going through a revolution of its own, and even the very idea of identity.<br /><br />That's a lot to keep track of, but Lehane manages not only to keep the threads going but to weave them into a tapestry of madness and paranoia that seeps into your skin much like the dampness seeps into the stones of the mental hospital. Even days after finishing this book you'll likely find yourself coming back to it, replaying scenes in your head and trying to unravel the plot twists. This is trully superior story-telling!
B001OQCV6K|2.0|This is not the Sherlock Holmes we have loved from the books.  His brilliant use of logic to solve crimes appears for only about 5 minutes near the end of the film.  Otherwise the character is dumbed-down to appeal to fans of Fight Club.  The plot is incoherent.  It's really a waste of 2 hours of your time.
0316044938|4.0|I read Alice Sebold's The Lovely Bones when it first came out. I loved the book and shared my recommendation with several friends, all of whom were equally as enthusiastic about the book. When I heard the a movie version was being filmed and Peter Jackson, the man behind the spectacular Lord of the Rings films, was directing, I felt like the sweet, haunting novel of grief and loss and how it can affect a family was in the right hands.    As soon as the movie came out on DVD I raced to the video store for a copy. But my reaction to the film was jaw-dropping. How could Peter Jackson have created such a beautiful \\"heaven,\\" but missed so much of the book's emotional impact? Finally I convinced myself to go back and re-read The Lovely Bones to make sure my reaction would be the same the second time around.    To my relief, the book is still as moving as it was the first time around. The character of Susie, as she meets her horrific death and then watches her family and friends come together and fall apart in ways both large and small, stills packs the same emotional wallop. The Lovely Bones is powerful, but I never found it to be overwhelming. I can't imagine any greater pain than losing a child, but with Susie as the narrator the book never sinks into angst and melodrama.    Sure, there are moments when Sebold comes close to going over the top and nearly loses control of her characters (as with the scene with Susie's \\"spirit\\" and her two best childhood friends late in the book). But Sebold proves adept at keeping the book from going off the rails - a task not many authors can handle so adoitly in their debut.
B003BKF696|5.0|There is a mysterious and hypnotic allure when listening to the new National album.  It's almost a<br />  religious experience.  Beautiful and surreal, the lyrics hover with a vibrating tenacity, weaving<br />  through the complex human web of soul/heart/mind with admirable ease.  Matt Berninger's deep,<br />  resonating baritone voice is the sad vehicle of love, gently blasting a truck-size hole through<br />  every defense.  The nature of the songs is reflective & melancholy, but never maudlin.  There is a<br />  rolling, almost drone-like quality to the music, though it never conquers the melody, never steals<br />  the rhythm.  There's a heavy & heady sense of wistful comfortableness as the songs tread, with a<br />  careful boldness, through places you know you have to go, even want to be...still, it's clear this<br />  kind of beauty &power comes with a price.  It's a smooth ride, but you just know that the waters<br />  are dark & deep, and  whatever is down there wants you, bad.  5th album from this Brooklyn band.<br />  Sometimes they remind me of Calla, American Music Club, Tindersticks.  \\"High Violet\\" is a quietly<br />  brilliant contender for album of the year.
B0019N8P2W|2.0|First, I heard that Daria was being released on DVD.  I rejoiced.<br /><br />Second, I found it at the store.<br /><br />Third, I was confused by the packaging (8 disks in a standard DVD box?! WHAT)<br /><br />...and finally, fourth, I looked it up on Amazon to see if I could get a better deal (over $70 at the store.. o_O) and lo and behold - I find out that we have once again been bent over the table by the music industry.<br /><br />My husband works from within the industry and he can tell you first hand how corrupt it is: from ignorant kids being taken advantage of by signing horrid contracts to performers killing people and having the label clean up the PR nightmare.  If you are thinking about getting into this industry, I highly recommend the adult entertainment industry - it's less corrupt.<br /><br />This is the same issue (music) that killed the Beavis and Butthead boxed set(s) for me - it's like trying to watch Jaws to Tangerine Dream.  It just doesn't have nearly the same impact as the original. Now, one would think that because the music was paid for and royalties given (like in a movie or other television shows) at time of airing and re-airing, this would allow them to be included in DVD form (IE would allow for smoother contract negotiation)...yet they are missing.  I also find this extremely interesting that it seems MTV has the most problems with this issue.  This leads me to believe MTV (and its associates/VIACOM) simply does not want to pony up the funds required to grant the many artists used for their animated series the royalties they deserve OR they are planning to trickle the music back in (IE what they sort-of did with the newest Beavis and Butthead boxed sets) to attempt to milk the public.  The third possibility is the multiple record labels involved cannot reach an agreement with VIACOM, which is also money-related.<br /><br />...and they wonder why the torrents do so well.<br /><br />I may buy this product when the price drops somewhere in the $20s.

The movie was well thought out and it must have taken forever to make!  I feel this one is too overlooked.  My spouse thought it was better than originally expected.
0618918248|4.0|I had been wanting to read the God Delusion ever since my wife read it and told me of how much she enjoyed it.  When my wife read it she was somewhere between agnostic and Christian, not quite sure what to believe.  She didn't personally believe the Bible literally but she did believe that people with belief were generally good people.  After reading this book her opinion changed and she is now an atheist too.  So I was intrigued, and as an atheist, I though it would be a good read.  I hoped it would be a book I could recommend to any of my Christian friends who were unhappy with their religion and looking for something else to believe in, or not believe in as the case may be.  Sadly this book does not fill that role, so I will continue looking for one that does.    Perhaps my expectations were just too high coming in, I found the book rather hard to push through.  Maybe it was because I had already come to so many of the conclusions that he did in the book on my own and thus when reading, I was continually waiting for him to get to the point.  Or maybe it was because I was hoping for some new insights or ideas, which sadly I found the book lacking in.  However some few of the ideas he wrote about in the book (or more often some of the quotes or references) included were very interesting to me.  Either thought provoking or interesting to me, I quite enjoyed them.  They are the reason I gave the book a positive rating at all.  In general I found about 90% of the book to be slow, boring, or just plain poorly thought out.  Because of he remaining 10% of the book that I liked and because the book has convinced some people to leave a religion that was detrimental to their health, I gave it 4 stars.  For pure entertainment value, or the strength of his arguments I would rate it at a 3 or less.    For a book with the supposed intention of converting religious people to be atheists, I find it lacking.  It may be able to help some people who are already on the fence to becoming an atheist.  However I think someone who is secure in their religious beliefs would either be too offended early on to actually continue reading the book, or too stubborn in their ways to even consider applying reason (as I see it) to their beliefs.  It is hard to try to convince a religious person that science should be used to prove or disprove God when they believe that God is beyond science.  If someone believes in spite of all reason that their book contains all that is right and true in the world then wouldn't you be better off using parts of that book as a base for you argument?  Granted that is kind of hard when the book contradicts itself.  They could always find a counter argument in another passage.  But you do have to speak their language if you want to get through to them.  It's like trying to argue with someone who speaks French when you are speaking English, it is not going to work.    I think a more noble and more productive goal would be to try to convince those who take their Holy book literally that they shouldn't trust to a book that is several thousand years old and has been translated, and changed several times over its history.  Or to change the opinion of people on their stance towards religion.  For instance prosecuting people who break the law because of their religious beliefs.  If for instance a Muslim family moves to England and follows Sharia law, they shouldn't be allowed to break the laws of England.  I'm not saying  they should go back to where they came from, but they should be obeying the law of the country they are living in.  Just because they believe that Sharia law trumps all other laws, doesn't make it true.  Dawkins did get one thing very right in his book.  We shouldn't be bending over backwards in an effort to not offend religious people.  But if you are trying to change their mind, offending their beliefs is not a good place to start...    ****************In response to Bruce Bain***************************************For some reason Amazon.com will not let me respond in the usual manner, so I have to add my response directly to my review:    ISSUE THE FIRST    (1) I agree that science cannot explain the supernatural.  Luckily I don't believe in the supernatural.  There are phenomena that science cannot currently explain.  That does not mean that there is no explanation or that it somehow defies the natural laws.  It just means we don't understand it yet.  Much like cell phones and TV's would seem to be supernatural to primitive humans.    ISSUE THE SECOND    (1) I would disagree that the statement is an A Dicto Simpliciter.  Perhaps another qualifier would have been helpful for you, had I said \\"in spite of all natural reason\\" would that have been better for you?  I find it odd to have to qualify my use of reason to mean reason that is not supernatural, for I don't think the supernatural is reasonable at all.  However I wonder why you object to this sentence at all as I'm suggesting that in order to debate the existence of God with a Christan (for instance) you should use the \\"knowledge\\" in their own Bible.  Perhaps if they are unwilling to listen to Natural reason they will be open to listening to Supernatural reason.    (2) I find this point very odd indeed.  I would think that debating a religious person using material from their own scripture would be entirely grey thinking.  I am also confused on your use of \\"unsubstantiated\\" and \\"negative stereotyping\\" as it is a qualified statement.  I said \\"IF someone believes in spite of all reason\\", not \\"ALL religious people believe in spite of all reason\\".    ISSUE THE THIRD    (1) Not really sure why this is even the third issue and not a continuation of the second considering it is the next two sentences in the same paragraph that you are discussing as well as the same argument you are making.  Once again you use \\"A Dicto Simpliciter\\" for \\"they\\" which I already qualified (see above).  If \\"they\\" had been referring to all religious people or all Christians or the like, you might have had ground to stand on.  I believe you do not understand the concept, you couldn't (and yet you did) even accuse me of generalizing here, let alone a sweeping generalization.  I am also confused you your use of \\"Atheist rhetoric\\", its like you think its a cult or a religious group or something.  This is the first book on the subject I have ever read, I'm not part of some group.  In fact \\"These sentences are rather typical of common Atheist rhetoric\\" might actually be an A Dicto Simpliciter.  Perhaps by atheist rhetoric you actually just mean common sense, or reason.    CONCLUSION    Of course its not an objective review, its a subjective review, in fact that is what pretty much all the reviews on amazon.com are...  This is not a scientific journal we are talking about here.  This is a bunch of people giving their opinions on the books that they have read.  It's not a discussion, its not a debate, or at least it shouldn't be.  But if you are going to make up a bunch of lies about what someone has posted in their review, I guess it will end up being a debate.  Yes I do presume to offer my personal testimony on whether or not I liked a book and why.  Regardless of whether or not it is fiction.  I am interested in if and why other people liked a book when I am considering purchasing it.  If I wanted to make an objective review about the contents of this book, I would have peer reviewed it (assuming I was qualified to even do so).    I also find it amusing that you think that non fiction books need to be addressed philosophically.  So all the diet books out there need to be discussed philosophically?  But most intriguing of all is why you even bothered to critique my review in the first place.  You spent your entire time critiquing paragraph 3 which started \\"For a book with the supposed intention of converting religious people to be atheists, I find it lacking.\\"  From your writing I would guess that you are religious, possibly even studying theology.  Are you worried that because I said the book was ineffective at converting people to atheism and you think that will lead to people actually reading it and getting converted?  You gave no opinion on what your opinion of the book is, or whether or not you agree with it.    It seems to me that perhaps you just like to practice using your theology, or maybe its a homework assignment from school to argue with an atheist.  Do you just sit here all day responding to reviews of this book?  I presume that you are learning \\"A Dicto Simpliciter\\" in school right now.  Did they also teach you to use lots of big words, old latin phrases and to capitalize the big words to make them stand out?  I only have a high school diploma, but even I can use wikipedia and google to look up big words.  However coming from a lesser education means I try not to be a sesquipedalian like yourself.  (But every now and then I can't help myself)
B0036XN2L2|5.0|Just listened to the whole album in one sitting, and all I can say is wow.  All the people who dislike this ablum are entitled to their opinion, but I just don't get it!  How could you not like this album?  I have not really been a fan of any Scorpions album since the early 90's until Humaity: Hour 1.  On the latest (last) release, every song is incredibly well written and has great hooks, the band is in top form, there's some amazing solos, and the production value is top notch.  Why the poor reviews?  It has to be that they are expecting 80's Scorps or something.  I don't know. This is as close as we're going to get, and in a world with no Dio, and now no Scorpions, I am sooo sad, but happy to have such an amazing album that celebrates the best of what the band was, and what they have become.

I am in decent shape, not too overweight and have a strong core from pilates, yoga and TaeBo...well, Jillian kicked my butt this morning.  I have never done a workout video this intense but so non-threatening.  I love Jillian's style and I guess I just trust her, which made it so much easier for me to work hard.  I know she gets results, and like she said, if 400 lb people can do jumping jacks, so can I! This workout flows continually and just when you think you can't do another lunge or jack or push-up it's on to the next move.  I LOVED IT! It also showed me clearly where the gaps are in my workout routine. I took a shower afterward and could hardly stand or lift my arms to wash my hair!  I know I will be feeling the after-glow of this great workout all day, and that is exactly what I want.
B0019X3ZZY|1.0|I rented this movie based on reviews that stated it was thought provoking and deep. I didn't see anything in this garbage heap that was intelligent or art. I don't know how this movie is not banned in the USA, the movie has underage actors naked the whole movie being sodomized and no other plot lines.       Just because a film or video is made by a famous director or studio doesn't mean it cannot be labeled as underage pornography. This movie made me cringe for one simple reason and that is people actually enjoyed watching it.

Pro  Non fatique headphone, I listened to it for 4 hours straight without my ears getting tire.  Sound quality is quite details, you can tell if your cd has a slight scatch on it.  Natural sound, not too boomy or heavy bass and not too bright.    Con  Open-air headphone, some one sit next to you can hear what you are listening to.  The head set is kind of Big.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|You have to love the Big Bang Theory. I am sure it will go down in history as one of the best TV comedy sitcoms. Full of laughs as you watch these nerdy guys. But one has to ask is Sheldon really human?  I am so pleased to have the first two seasons and working on getting the other seasons as they are released.
B0035V35P8|3.0|First off it is a pretty good action packed movie.  There were some parts of the story that were a bet more personal than a lot of movies of this genre.  However;  I can overlook the fantastic things these hand held weapons could do such as making a clean cut through a skull with one hit....Even a power saw would have a difficult time cutting through a skull bone with flesh around it and brains still inside....Ok...I can just overlook that as fantasy.  What gets me about so many martial art films is how they figure these trained individuals can use some learned mental conscentrations to somehow defy physics.  When I see a Nija disappear with a smoke gernade that's logical.  When they disappear into thin air and then come back with super human speed like Clark Kent then that's just plain magic, and plain silly.  It works on Superman stories because that's part of the Superman character, but you don't start with totally human warriors and make them into super beings who can disappear, move at light speed, and even fly.  At that point the story becomes a living cartoon to me.  If you're an action junkie you'll get plenty of it here, but if you're looking for a movie with real warriors using their martial art skills then this is a bit of a disappointment...
B002OEBMN4|5.0|Slayer fans began the new millennium in a negative way: By stubbornly waiting a full five years to get to hear anything new. This began following the release of 2001's \\"God Hates Us All\\" and continued until \\"Christ Illusion\\" finally saw the light of day in the summer of 2006. Fortunately, following that, three years -- which is a reasonable length of time in between releases, mind you - was all it took for them to get back in the saddle and kick out another new one. As a result, some fans may view 2009's \\"World Painted Blood\\" as an unexpected pleasant surprise. If nothing else, it at least acts as to more-or-less offset and/or atone for the fairly-lengthy, above-mentioned hiatus that came with it. True, one could make the argument that this album was a bit of a rush job because a) it was an easy way to be released from a record deal (since it is the last item on the contract); and b) even though the record was in its infant stages of development stages circa the beginning of 2009, it was announced that it would be on store shelves by summer (just in time for a headlining gig at that summer's Mayhem Festival.)<br /><br />But that notwithstanding, the fact remains that \\"World Painted Blood\\" is every-bit-as-strong as its excellent (if much delayed) predecessor. Hence, even though this is a band that is (to date) entering its fourth decade of existence (!), they are still, without a doubt, are entirely capable of blasting out truly quality new material that (alongside \\"Christ Illusion\\") is the finest we've heard from them in almost 20 years (since 1990's \\"Seasons In The Abyss\\"), and that also ranks right alongside some of their best of all-time. Furthermore, they show absolutely no sign of sign of slowing down or softening-up at all; they are still as fast, brutal, inspired, maniacal, skillful, and all-around dangerous as ever. Anyone who knows anything about heavy metal is well-aware of everything involved with an album by this California-based quartet: Turbo-charged tempos, wild, shredding guitar solos, duelling, face-melting leads, and amazing, white-hot, Gynsu-sharp riffs from Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman (a very original and legendary six-string duo), distorted bass lines, and frontman Tom Araya's visceral, amelodic screams of enraged, and frequently Satanic-leaning lyrical content. All of these traits remain firmly in tact here. And the heck of it is, on \\"WPB,\\" Slayer are still managing to find ways to push the sonic envelope an iota even further. The key ingredient? Dave Lombardo. A founding member of the band and the original drummer, Dave left the fold in 1992 to pursue various other musical projects before returning in 2002. And it may have been said before, but it will be said again: This guy is one awesome skinsman. With plenty of inventive blast and impeccable thrash beats to go around, he drives these eleven songs, ensuring that their levels of momentum and muscle never dip.<br /><br />The title cut kicks things off on a foreboding note spoken word vocals, a martial drum beat, and chords that are almost pure doom metal. From there, the listener is lead into blood-pumping thrash territory, complete with fiery, double-bass-driven chugging guitars, and a catchy, moshable, \\"Seasons In The Abyss\\"-reminiscent groove. And it's all capped off by memorable vocals in the choruses and a noisy, dive-bombing, whammy-bar guitar solo. \\"Unit 731\\" is a bulldozing, rampaging assault fueled by a deluge of great, barn-burning buzzsaw riffage that evokes Slayer's \\"Reign In Blood\\" era, thunderous, pounding rhythms created by Mr. Lombardo's tight, slamming, powerhouse blast beats, and two solos (one is \\"wah\\"-esque, and the other is classically chaotic). \\"Snuff\\" keeps your blood pumping and the frenetic energy going thanks to its bludgeoning guitar parts, really deft drumming, and several fast, screaming, atonal, and near-shrieky-sounding solos that build off of each other. On the flipside, don't be surprised if \\"Beauty Through Order\\" raises a few of the hairs on the back of your neck, what with the doomy atmosphere, and brooding, crawling tempo in its intro. This track also has industrial-strength, chug and churn rhythms. And it is all sandwiched between searing, discordant soloing. Back on familiar ground, \\"Public Display of Dismemberment\\" is a ripping, charging thrash melee with debatable grindcore-tinges. It is filled with blistering, nimble-fingered riffing, and thunderous double-time drumming (which really helps to fill-up the bottom-end).<br /><br />Two other highlights include \\"Psychopathy Red,\\" a scorching and inexorable speedster that is noteworthy for its blazing guitar interplay, and good, grumbling bass interlude; and \\"Playing With Dolls,\\" which shockingly begins with nice guitar harmonies, lightly-picked strumming, and ominous, underlying bass notes. Fear not, though, the vintage Slayer sound eventually kicks in around 2:30 in, and the remainder of \\"Playing With Dolls\\" terrorizes the neighboorhood with the best of `em. But the record's clear standout is track eight, \\"Americon,\\" which marries a cool tribal beat intro with a memorable \\"wah-wah\\" guitar lead, a sludgy, grungy bass bottom, decisively political lyrics (i.e. \\"it's all about the oil!\\"), stomping, galloping drums, well-placed tempo changes, and three surprisingly ripping solos.<br /><br />\\"World Painted Blood\\" isn't a particularly groundbreaking affair (it's just a fan pleaser -- look at it like it that, and the results are very satisfying). Plus, there are some gag-worthy song topics moments (see \\"Snuff\\"). But since when does anybody take Kerry King too seriously?! The lyrics have always been all just tongue-in-cheek. And finally, the production is a bit shoddier this time around than it has been (the drums and vocals are higher up in the mix). But this sound quality does get better -- it just needs a few listens in order for one's ears to adjust to it. The bottom line? Yes, it is possible to find a few flaws in \\"WPB,\\" but they are so minor that it would be nitpicking to look for them. There really is very little to dislike here, folks. This is yet another great, and very-worthy installment in an already-incredible discography, and further evidence that Slayer are untouchable in the world of thrash, and that they are one of the godliest heavy metal bands (in general) ever to walk this Earth.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|This review will be in two parts: Part one the Blu-Ray and Part two the actual movie - I will avoid a detailed plot synopsis or detailed spoilers.     Part one - The blu-ray package  Yes, as stated before, this blu-ray contains nothing but the movie (aside from the dvd version on a separate disk). There are no extras, commentaries, making of, nothing.   I think the price is sorta high for that. I also think they should have just packaged the blu-ray and charged less. At one store for example, I saw the DVD version for 19.99 and this version (with both disks) for 29.99. Having said that, I have to say that this movie is a joy on Blu-ray. If you saw it in 3D (as I did), liked it,  and thought you would not like it in 2D please think again. I was very pleased with the transition. The color and sound track were just outstanding. All 1.78:1. It really looks good and sounds good. So good that my wife and I became completely immersed again. Now the question is, should you wait for the extras if you intend to buy this? That depends, most of the time I don't look at that stuff so for me this was ok although I still think the blu-ray should have been packaged alone at the same price as the dvd. If you must have all the extras then you should wait for the other releases and rent this.     Part two - the movie  Ok, yes, this story has been told before in many other books, movies etc., but it still works here. If you're going to get all hung up because the \\"military\\" is portrayed as less than complimentary or one dimensional or because of the supposed \\"politics\\" (nature good, corporations bad)then frankly you won't enjoy this. After all its a movie, not real life.     The military are mercenaries and not US soldiers, and a little bit of earth/nature awareness or sympathy for indigenous people wouldn't hurt us in my opinion.  I'm a vet myself, so I have an opinion. I served with many people who considered anyone \\"not us\\" to be \\"wogs\\" or monkeys. Its a detachment that you learn toone degree or another. If you are lucky you get over it, if not, maybe you join the Mercs, I don't know.    The world building that becomes clear in this film is amazing. The common look of the animals (most have two pair of legs or arms up front and one in back) and the variety of plant life look like someone put a lot of thought into designing this world. The flying animals are so realistic. The scene where a \\"chopper\\" follows a waterfall down is very real. Flights of \\"birds\\" that from a distance look like something from African nature films. I find that about 5 minutes into the film, I'm totally immersed in it. This is the sign of a good movie for me, it's kicked my suspension of disbelief into high gear.     The plot pretty much follows the traditional hero's journey as described by Joseph Campbell, starting with the \\"call to adventure\\" or \\"Departure\\". Here, this is Jake leaving earth, and later, leaving and his crippled body when he spends his night in the forest in his avatar.     The other elements of the hero's journey we see are:    \\"The Initiation and road of trials\\", learning the ways of the Na'vi and the subsequent war.   \\"The Return\\" with a \\"boon\\", in this case finding what is important to oneself, your purpose and some redemption.     How can you go wrong with a story like that? It's practically baked into our very nature. It resonates and vibrates though us. Add a believable visual world that sucks you in,  really good actors, and you have a terrific entertainment piece. Very well done. At my age I look for films like this to hit me emotionally and make me feel like I'm 10 years old again. This film hit that chord on many levels for me:    The beauty of the primitive strange jungle especially at night  The sky, with a large planet and other moons in it  Sailing the air over Pandora feeling the bond with my Ikran   The visual horror as a Pa'li runs from the battle injured and on fire    All emotional responses to very good film making. For me, this hit all the numbers and took 40+ years off my age for a few hours. Thanks James Cameron.    In summary I'd recommend this movie to anyone with a healthy suspension of disbelief and a love of high adventure or \\"space opera\\". I'm giving it 5 stars, I'd give it 6 if I could. I own it, I'll watch it multiple times.

B002ZG98VE|1.0|This has to be the biggest disappointment of a movie I have ever seen..... simply boring.  The acting was flat, the pace was slow, it was dark and drab, there was NOTHING in it about Robin Hood until the last 30 seconds of the movie.  Look, I am both a big fan of Robin Hood and Russell Crowe, not to mention, a life long student of legends like Robin Hood and King Arthur, yet, this movie had me wanting to get up and go half way through... If you are looking for a movie that reflects the spirit of Robin Hood, this is not it.

B0010X745K|4.0|There wasn't one monster in this movie, not one giant slug, bug or slimy flying thing that frightened me as much as the human monster, that thing we become in a crisis, born of fear and panic.  I am not a big Stephen King fan, but I am always impressed by his ability to show us the monster within us, that being much more dastardly and devious and dangerous than any other creature that might pop out from under our bed.<br /><br />This movie started out much like any other Stephen King movie, a group of people are trapped by unseen forces (in MAINE!), they break into factions quickly, those that believe quick action is best, those that think waiting it out is best, those that aren't thinking much at all, just shaking in fear in the corner praying.  Soon they discover a bit of what they are facing, but as time goes on, fear takes over and it becomes apparent that it is much more dangerous to remain inside with the others than to risk your life to the unseen monsters outside.  That sure says a lot about us as a society.<br /><br />This movie made me wonder how I would handle myself in a similar situation, because other than the giant flying bugs and creatures with fangs, this sort of crisis could happen at any time. Natural disasters happen and so can being trapped with others, and as people get hungrier, more desperate, they might do anything, and things can always turn into a sort of modern day witch hunt, as we look to blame and seek solutions in unlikely ways.  I love a movie that makes me think, even if it's disturbing!<br /><br />All in all, I really liked this film.  I liked that it made me think.  I didn't like what it says about us as humans, but, hey...the truth hurts!  It was disturbing, made me cry, and I probably won't be watching it again.  Do I think it's worth seeing...YES!  Give it a try.  It's worth one night of uneasiness.

030726839X|5.0|Winston Churchill (1874-1965)is well served in this excellent new biograpy by the eminent British historian Max Hastings. Despite the teeming shelves of Churchillian literature this new book is well worth reading for the insights into the character, will and bulldog determination of WSC.<br />  Churchill became  Prime Minister of Great Britain on May 10, 1940. He replaced the disastrous appeasement policiy of Neville Chamberlain the Tory premier WSC served as Lord of the Admirality. On that same day Hitler's hordes invaded the Low Countries. Soon Churchill was charged with having to rescue the British Army from Dunkirk; keep the nation going despite the Battle of Britain and deal with social unrest at home. Churchill was a Victorian man who refused independence for India and wanted to keep the British Empire intact on the world stage. In this mission he failed as the little English donkey England had to sit at the summit of Western leadership with the behemoth bear of Stalin's Russia and the soaring England of the behemoth arsenal of democracy and military might of FDR's United States.<br />  Churchill is faulted for wanting to micromanage the conduct of the war. He England into nonproductive expeditions into the Balkans, Greece and wanting the invasion of the continent to go through Italy. Instead America prevailed and the invasion was launched on D-Day June 6, 1944 on the beaches of Normandy in northwestern France. Churchill's greatest contribution was in his stirring oratory over the BBC, House of Commons and to the beleagured but tough British men and women.<br />  Churchill was an egocentric aristocrat who was petted and spoiled. His longsuffering wife Clementine would goad him into better behavior with subordinates and try to keep his drinking and smoking within bounds. He was, nevertheless, a towering political genius whose courage, fortitude and admantine refusal to surrender led the Western Allies to victory in 1945. He distrusted Russia but knew he needed the Red Empire to be on Britain''s side if the war was to be won.He cherished a friendship with FDR knowing England would not survive unless the United States became an active participant in the war. Churchill's Great Britain was the militarily weakest of the big three coalitoon as US and Soviet arms dwarfed those of the land of hope and glory.

B002AWX6UM|5.0|Ishmael Beah gives a firsthand account of his life during the war in Sierra Leone. Won over by the emotional manipulation of authoritative militia men, the fear of being alone, and the need for food and shelter, we discover how the transition might happen from child to child soldier. His account is terribly honest. We see his childhood robbed from him, the calluses that formed around his heart and just how desensitized and cold-blooded the human spirit can become under cruel circumstances. Futile as they all are, brace yourself for the realities of war.    Many children were unjustly laden with this same ruthless burden of soldiery. The trek out of it for those who were lucky enough to survive was tough. PTSD I'm sure lingers with many of them as adults. The good news is the resilience of the child's spirit. With the right intervention and willpower, children can regenerate and become resensitized to go on and become reputable members of society. Despite what they have done, they can shed the guilt and claim their lives back.    Disgusted by the conflict and the details of what Beah executed and endured, you'll set the book down enlightened but hurting.    Cheers to the good work Beah is doing now!

0786868724|5.0|Just happened to see a new book by Mitch Albom in the bookstore and how could I leave a Mitch Albom book when I have liked his three earlier ones so much.    This book starts with a query which the author's rabbi - Albert Lewis, puts him - Would Mitch do the rabbi's eulogy when he dies. Rabbi is 82 years old at that time. Mitch was a little unsure why he was being chosen, he wants to know the Rabbi better in order to write on him later. Initially Mitch expected it to be a two-or a three-weeks project but it went on for eight years. This exercises made him come closer to the faith which he had lost long time back and had not made any attempt to revive it. It would have continued like this, had it not been for this request of Rabbi. Almost at the same time, he gets involved with another man of God - Henry Covington, following a different religion, who, in spite of having a dark past himself was trying his best to bring people to the world of faith. Mitch realizes later that he is on a journey of learning some life lessons himself, believing that there is peace in keeping faith in some bigger, higher power than us. The author gets to talk to both of these men of God about different challenges and hard times that humans go through and how the faith is tested in such times. Eventually he concludes that faith is the one thing that can bridge the gap between people.    A well written book. I enjoyed reading it but still it could not replace my personal favourite among Mitch Albom's books - For one more day.
0812975219|3.0|The book is entertaining and peppered with anecdotes and generally a good read. The authors basic premise is that in markets it is hard to tell the difference between luck and skill, and that given a large enough initial population, there will always be a handful of 'lucky idiots' who make it big for a given period of time. He uses probability theory to justify this - e.g., given 10,000 money managers and a 50% chance of being successful each year, there will be a couple of hundred left after five years who survived just by random luck. This is fundamentally incorrect because, unlike coin flips, the behaviour of those 10,000 managers is not independent of each other. More accurately, given 10,000 managers there might be a 100 trading strategies that are truly independent of each other, and even then when you throw in factors like leverage, margin calls, interest rates, political events and human behaviour, there are a lot fewer 'degrees of freedom' in the market. In fact, if everybody pursued trading strategies that were truly independent there would be far volatility in the market than we see today. When it comes to judging companies, the author is even further off the mark. Here, past performance is a pretty strong indicator of future performance. I would rather invest in a company with a 10 year track record of delivering strong profits in a manner that I can understand than the newest, flashiest kid on the block - then again I'm an investor not a 'trader', and I've ridden out highs and lows for the last 10 years with a moderate degree of success.    I agree with a few things he says - like the fact that daily 'news' is corrosive to the human brain, especially to the investor and that there are 'black swan' events that catch people off guard. However I couldn't help but think of Donald Rumsfeld's humorous \\"known unknows\\" and \\"unknown unknowns\\" comment as I read about black swans. As the author appropriately quotes, \\"There is nothing new under the sun\\".
B002C6A6N6|5.0|I think this is the most famous series regarding Old Mountaineers Western and Native Americans,  a good cast and scenery, landscapes and dresses.  Just a trouble, i have bought the all seasons series, and Amazon offered a dvd more to buy for less, but  the same dvd was included in the dvd's casket, so i bought one double, not cause of me and in this case amazon do not admit this matter and so do not refund.
B0000AUHPB|4.0|Another in a long line of English caper films, The Italian Job (1969), directed by Peter Collinson, is a classic example in the genre.  With a mostly British cast, headed by lovable bad boy Michael Caine (The Ipcress File), the film follows the adventures of a criminal gang, engaged in a bold robbery attempt, executed with precision, while gloriously waving the Union Jack in the face of the opposition.<br /><br />Charlie Croker (Caine) is just out of prison, when he receives information about a robbery scheme, from his friend Roger Beckerman (Rossano Brazzi), who has just been killed in Italy, by the Mafia.  Beckerman's plan, involves stealing a delivery of gold en route to the Fiat plant in Turin, Italy.  The idea is to utilize the city's traffic control system to create gridlock, to enable the thieves to escape.  With most of the plan outlined, Croker needs to work out the details, find a crew, and get financial backing.  For the later, he turns to Mr. Bridger (Noel Coward), who although behind bars in one of her Majesty's prisons, is still the man in charge.  Although initially resistant, seeing that it would be a huge boost for British morale, Bridger greenlights the Italian Job.<br /><br />With support of girlfriend Lorna (Margaret Blye), Croker gathers materials, and puts his group together, including math whiz Professor Simon Peach (Benny Hill).  The group arrives in Italy, but experiences car damage, and encounter a major roadblock from the Mafia.  Undaunted, the Brits continue as planned, infiltrating Milan's traffic control center, and executing their plan to near perfection.<br /><br />The Italian Job is probably most known for the mad driving of a set of red, white, and blue mini Coopers, used to transport the stolen gold.  Maneuvering through the streets, sewers and sidewalks of Milan, the three minis blaze through all manner of alternate routes.  With world renowned Remy Julienne, and his driving team behind the wheel, the film features an impressive, and light hearted display of driving skill.  As the mission nears completion, Quincy Jones's soundtrack builds and elevates to celebratory levels, with Michael Caine leading the bawdy singing.  Making their escape in a bus, collecting the gold, and recklessly tossing the mini's down the side of a mountain, the group's hubris goes a little too far, and the film ends memorably in a literal cliffhanger, for the self-preservation society.<br /><br />Producer Michael Deeley, came up with the unusual ending, and had a resolution in mind for a sequel, which never came to be.  The point of the film was to showcase the brazen execution by Croker's team, and to have ripping good time in the process.  In that, The Italian Job was an uproarious success.  Caine and his boys exercise some restraint, but they certainly push very hard to hold up the British end.  Back in England, those behind bars offer a glorious salute to Mr. Bridger and his boys, for pulling off the outrageous heist.<br /><br />The enhanced version looks and sound great.  The cinematography in Milan and the Italian mountains is often delightful.  Extras include a commentary track by producer Michael Deeley, and author Matthew Field.  It's a little dry, but is still informative.  There are also some well produced making of featurettes, but unfortunately there is no contribution from the iconic Michael Caine.earted display of driving skill.

B003E8P9G0|5.0|It was a really good book and I really enjoyed it. It reminds me of the Percy Jackson series and it was very clever righting. I was very fascinated by the egyptian mythology. I also really liked the characters. Even after reading the Percy Jackson series I am still in awe of using mythology in modern times it was a great idea!
B000002H72|5.0|Of all the Pixies albums this is their most stellar. Varying between lighthearted and deep, moody songs, this album holds the best of what they have to offer. Black's vocals range from soft to screaming, and whether electric or acoustic, the guitar work is fantastic. Doolittle contains the best of early 90's indie rock.

B000000WGL|5.0|i bought the cd when it first came out, way, way back in the day. soon as i got an ipod, it was one of the first to go in. i've got \\"you shouldn't take it so hard\\" as my cell phone's ringtone. i LOVE keef!
0385523386|5.0|I enjoyed the quick style of the writing; it was detailed but not overwhelmingly so.  Even though you knew how it would end you still were captivated from cover to cover.  I appreciate the few statistics that were dropped here and there and would have enjoyed more.  I was constantly astounded by how well it was written by someone (although well educated) who was not a seasoned writer.  And even though my background makes me innately dislike the author (white, blond, \\"Wasp\\", privileged, etc (as she self describes)) I found myself perpetually intrigued by this paradox.  I also found myself wondering who the likely audience is for this book.  Women like Piper? - I assume there aren't too many ex cons that share her background.  I loved the parallels of the Martha Stewart case.  I also could not picture the footwear Piper would run in since she only mentions the black steel toed boots!
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Great price, great product, fast shipping.  Thanks to Chuck Lorre and Amazon for making it possible.  The 2nd season of this show keeps the gang rolling right along in the same hilarious vein (think \\"Friends\\", but written for those with an IQ >70).  Quality production DVD's make the episodes easy to navigate and fun to watch.

B002VPE1B6|5.0|It's hard to find a movie appropriate for family viewing if you have young adults in the house.  Special effects are very cool and the whole family loved the story and went away with a message...about respecting life of all kinds.  Sure the picture is a bit harsh on developers, but it is just a story.  If you work in one of many fields, where your profession is made out to be the bad guy, then you're used to this.  I just can't rave about the special effects enough.  The animated characters are quite lifelike and very appealing.<br />I'd buy this movie again and I'd recommend it to the rest of my family (and to you, my Amazon family).
B001EN71DG|3.0|What can I say? Hayden Christensen should not be in this collection (much less movies in general). These are classic films and they should be given the respect they deserve.<br /><br />I kind of enjoyed the updated special effects but I can't abide having scenes redone. Oh sure, you can replace the washwoman with the emperor but tacking Hayden in place of the original Anakin is just plain wrong. I mean, seriously, how many Star Wars movies can he ruin?<br /><br />I'd like to see these movies released as they were originally screened. That's what you do with classics.
B00005JNJV|5.0|\\"Batman Begins\\" has enough plot elements for 3 or 4 movies, and, amazingly, they all work, and they are all exciting.    The movie is very dark, but this is fitting.    Even the early scenes, of Bruce Wayne's childhood trauma with the bats, and his later trek to the lamasery, are interesting in themselves, and add a lot of emotional weight to the later scenes.    The acting is just superb.  Gary Oldman, who is one of the best actors ever, manages to be humble and awe-inspiring at the same time.  Morgan Freeman is understated and funny and riveting.  Katie Holmes shines.  Liam Neeson is persuasively ambiguous.  Cillian Murphy is deliciously creepy.  And even Christian Bale, who has the expressive range of a tree-stump, manages to be believable, likable, and complex.    (Tom Wilkinson, as a Mafia-boss, is a little over the top, but still a lot of fun.)    Lots of twists and turns.  Lots of surprises.  Great stuff.
B00003CX5P|2.0|But I didn't need them to know that Phantom Menace blows.<br /><br />This movie is barely more than a glossy reissue of the Star Wars merchandising line.<br /><br />Go to YouTube. Watch the review. You'll enjoy it more than you will Phantom Menace.
0763619612|5.0|Suddenly at the age of five or six, because their thought process is becoming more concrete, because children are looking for logic instead of warping reality to fit what they know, the creative process takes a hit. When you give them a paper, put them on the spot and ask them to draw all they can draw is a blank. Then comes the whining, `But, but..... I don't know what to draw. Can you help me?' That's it. The adult then rolls his/her sleeves, either demonstrates or gives ideas and the art transforms to the adult's art. It is no longer the child's. As a parent or as a teacher what do you do? How do you encourage the child to create?<br /><br />Peter H Reynolds tackles this in his The Dot. The teacher in this book, looks at Vashti's blank paper and asks her if it is a polar bear in a snow storm! She then encourages Vashti to make a mark. This leads Vashti to create a gallery full of paintings.

0064430227|5.0|That Harold....with his blue pajamas and his purple crayon he is such a riot.<br /><br />If he wants to walk on something he makes his own straight path and then realizes that a straight path is no fun because it leads no where. He wants excitement so he makes his own adventure like walking in to a forest, creating a scary dragon and ends up getting scared by his own imagination. Half way in to his adventures, Harold realizes that he wants to go home and the rest of his adventure is getting himself home. Harold is frantically trying to find the window of his bedroom in the hundreds of windows that he drew. Then he realizes that his window is `always right around the moon'. Sounds like the Akbar-Birbal story in which the guy looses his golden ring some place but is looking under the street light because there is plenty of light under the street light right?! This is the thinking process of a preschool child. Because of their limited life experiences and cognition, they often distort reality in order to fit what is happening to them. Harold is Piaget's pre-operational child, to the T.

B00338QELU|2.0|Given the recent popularity of Swedish crime fiction in the rest of the world, I decided to try this novel out.  I was less than satisfied.<br /><br />The novel started out promising enough.  A mass murder rampage in a sleepy snow covered town in Sweden.  But half way through the book the story stalled.  In the last quarter of the book, it became very apparent to me the author just made things up on the fly with no forethought or planning.  Finally when it was time to end the book, he just chopped the story off with a \\"Deux Ex Machina\\".<br /><br />A few specific criticisms:<br /><br />1) Horrible dialogs.  The conversations between characters, especially towards the end of the book, became extremely painful to read.  It is as though the characters lacked all emotions and might as well been robots.  I am certain no one in Sweden or China (and I have been to both countries) talks like that.  In particular the conversations between the women made me cringe.  Could I get an adjective?  An emotion?<br /><br />2) Random asides that serves no purpose.  The author included many long asides, for example, the court cases that Birgitta Roslin is working on.  But it had no relation whatsoever with the mystery.  It did not make me understand the main character better.  It got annoying, fast.<br /><br />3) Motive for the mass murder is not only unconvincing, it is down right stupid.  Revenge is for redemption from a personal pain or injury.  A revenge for a 160 year old beating that involves a mass murder is not in the realm of possibilities.  It doesn't make any sense.<br /><br />Why not a one star review?  The book did have a very promising start.  The geopolitics of China's rural/urban problem and China's glowing influence in Africa sounds very much true (abet with some imagination injected).  Some of the historical research and Chinese language transliteration (ping yin) is very accurate.  So it isn't all bad.<br /><br />But it is far from good.  I would recommend instead reading the Millennium Trilogy by Stieg Larsson.

B002GZQYMK|5.0|The item came late ..it took like 1 month.. but anyway its worth it...    As Muse fan when this album came I wasn't convinced or sure about it comparing to their earlier works, but after hearing it again its for sure rocks ...    They changed bit of their style but on the other hands its good to see a band which explore and try different things ..  Kind of Queen, pop style & classical..But overall it paid.. And this album is great .. For Muse fans this one is must ...    Love Muse, Love Matt and Love Alternative Rocks ...
1416594787|3.0|Dawkins states in the beginning of the book that deeply religious people accept evolution as a fact.  He goes on and claims there is some 40% of people that don't believe we evolved from animals...and this is what compelled him to write the book.  Unfortunately if I gave this book to one of the \\"40%\\" they probably would not read it...for very many reasons...but mostly because they do not think critically.  Personally I am very spiritual and believe that evolution is obvious.  I'm not as convinced as Dawkins that Adam and Eve were not real but a means of telling a story.  They very well could have been created by the hand of God...using evolution and genetic engineering as tools to produce physical beings in His likeness.  We (all of us...science and religion) really know very little about the grand plan or how we got here or why.  Regardless things have worked out rather well to put us here.  \\"The Greates Show On Earth\\" does very little to advance our thinking and give us insight...instead it seems as though it is just one more attempt to convince the 40% of people that won't pay attention to it.  Nor does it make any arguments that convince us we are here by evolution alone.  That is too bad.   In the mean time I'd recommend reading \\"Just Six Numbers\\" by Martin Reese and \\"The Comsic Jackpot\\" by Paul Davies.  These books will really put you in awe of the forces and laws that put us here and hold us together...and how we are very lucky indeed.  Good books about science and scientists don't claim to know the answers and are confident enough to speculate on the possibilities even if they may seem supernatural.  The world has many wonders but there are very few answers or insights in Dawkin's book.  I'd only recommend it if you want to load up on arguments to confound your religious fundamentalist friend that thinks evolution is poppy-cock.   Then again that is not even worth the time for the discussion.  Just talk to your kids and make sure they keep an open mind yet learn how to think critically for themselves and don't accept dogma at face vaue, scientific or religious.  There are very few absolutes and we are in for a lot more surprises...and when they happen both sides will say \\"I told you so!\\".  In the meantime spend your time exploring the real questions rather than revisiting the well worn path of why evolution makes sense.
B0031OCY2E|2.0|This movie was just painful to watch. What's entertaining about a compulsive liar with (what is likely) a personality disorder? It MIGHT have been funny, but this movie can't decide if it's going to be a documentary, a comedy, a drama, or a farce. It clearly leans towards the latter, but IMO fails to do more than some sad combination of all of these.<br /><br />There is no hero, little tension, and no \\"silver lining\\" to this dark cloud. It's just a bunch of semi-competent people doing their own ego dance, and playing off each other in a listless circus.<br /><br />AVOID!
B0039TD7RC|3.0|There's something about Stones albums that make them last forever, and that's not just because they're mostly five-minute filler songs. It's the magic, and when you remaster the crap out of it the magic is lost. It's like taking away Harry Potter's wand - after that he's just a regular boy with a big scar on his forehead.    The sound of this album is much more compressed than previous masters, and suffers a constant noise problem that plagues the work. Often times the only discernible instruments are drums (mainly the cymbals) and saxophone. It's technically difficult to get classic rock albums to reach the volume levels of modern recordings, and I have to imagine Exile on Main Street was a nightmare to attempt. Generally, this loud mixing style works on contemporary pop music because it's driven by percussion and sparsely arranged. So you can see why Exile, which is a dense and muddy recording, will pose problems.    The songs that suffer most are \\"Rip This Joint\\", \\"Tumbling Dice\\", \\"Torn and Frayed\\", and \\"Let it Loose\\". On each of these tracks the dynamics are lost, the beautiful back up singers are buried behind a wash of cymbals and Jagger's performance is muted. This is absolutely painful on \\"Tumbling Dice\\", which is one my of all time favorite songs. Exile always had buried vocals, but somehow they've managed to bury them even more.    There's no doubt in my mind that on the engineer's meters the specs of the song are balanced and perfect - but isn't this the lesson of Exile on Main Street? Technically perfect isn't always better, so why attempt to take an album that is revered for its existing sound and spruce it up? It's a lost opportunity, but let's move on to the positive.    \\"Sweet Virginia\\" sounds downright fantastic. This track is an example of the pinnacle of remastering and I relished every minute hearing that song as new. Other songs that sound much better are \\"Loving Cup\\" and \\"Ventilator Blues\\". This isn't surprising because these songs are more sparse and driven by the drums. I always thought \\"Loving Cup\\" sounded a little forced and the remaster pulls a newfound energy out of the recording.    The previously unreleased tracks also fare better, since they were remixed (and I suspect mostly re-recorded) from the ground up. Unfortunately, none of the songs are keepers with the possible exception of \\"Plundered My Soul\\". The others go from mediocre (\\"Pass the Wine\\") to all out lame (\\"Aladdin Story\\" and \\"Following the River\\", which could have been performed by Elton John for Pete's sake). Still, it's really hard to thumb your nose at an extra half album of material. While the Stones have always been unashamed capitalists with their music, they never want to rip people off!    The alternate takes are fun, and would best be described as alternate versions. The first is a slower, raw and rhythmic version of \\"Loving Cup\\". It works so well I would venture to say it's better than the album version! Keith shouts drunkenly in the background and I, too, could see myself shouting this one at a bar over one-to-many beers. The other is a version of \\"Soul Survivor\\" sung by Keith, which is more a curiosity than a challenge to Jagger's swagger (heh).    Short interview snippets round out the deluxe edition and while none of them are revolutionary there are some quality moments. It was interesting to hear the Stones discuss the excessive taxation in the UK, Jagger almost calling himself talentless, as well as a little back and forth about having to record the album at Keith's house! What really comes through is that the Stones know exactly how great and yet how sucky they are.     Everyone interested in this album will find a version they like, so long as they are not viewing this as an upgrade from the 1999 reissue which I believe is the best edition. If you are new to Exile, please check out an earlier mix! You'll find it cleaner, more dynamic, and more engaging. Otherwise, general fans can get two discs worth of music for $9.99, medium fans can get an extra half album of Rolling Stones music for $19.99, and hardcores can get the vinyl and DVD thrown in for $136.89! I don't personally think the super deluxe version is worth it, but completionists and true fans will no doubt walk away very pleased. For everyone this is really an awesome value. Big ups to the Rolling Stones who could have gotten away with worse.
0385523386|2.0|I became interested in Piper Kerman's story when I read Larry's contribution to the NY Times Modern Love column and saw that her book was forthcoming. I bought the book and kept reading and reading, hoping for something interesting to pop up. It didn't.     The first chapter is great, but the whole middle section is crammed full of details about every person who she meets in prison. And so many people are introduced you can't even keep them straight. And of course her fiance and family are amazingly, perfectly supportive. She makes one small dig at her mother (about asking her daughter if she thought her mom looked her age) but other than that, every member of Team Piper comes off amazingly (and unbelievably) well.    I would like to know how she re-entered society, how it felt to be job-hunting with her criminal record, how difficult it was to fall back into her relationship with Larry after being imprisoned for 13 months. Instead, I got details about crocheted sex organ toys and a disagreement at the prison salad bar.     I'm sure prison wasn't easy or enjoyable. I just wish the book had told more of the interesting part of the story and less of the repetitive details.

B0039TD7RC|5.0|First of all Jagger and Richards' putdown of this album just shows they don't understand their own process (one reason \\"Start Me Up\\" stayed in the can for years, and the issued version was a one-time rip through what was intended to be a reggae song). This is a STONES album, most of the albums that have followed have been marred by Jagger picking takes that emphasize his vocals, the outtakes being almost always better (\\"Steel Wheels\\" and \\"Voodoo Lounge\\" are nearly great albums, but you wouldn't know it from the issued versions). The Stones aren't Jagger's backup band. When Keith went off into drugs during the recording of \\"Exile\\" I think he ceded his position to choose the final takes. Pity.     Anyway, \\"Exile\\" transcends the band and takes on its own life. It's ridiculous how good these songs are, when you break them down there doesn't seem to be anything extraordinary, it's all so loose and wild and inspired. There isn't any other album like it, and you just wish it would go on and on...    This issue - for some reason they seemed to be stumped how to remove hiss, which as a sound restorer I do and have done with the cuts most affected (\\"Shine a Light\\" in particular). Peculiar. Otherwise the sound is great, slightly better than the limited edition mid-90s issue (which managed to include the original LP repro cover and postcards, unlike this 'deluxe' version). The bonus tracks are great though on \\"Plundered\\" Jagger over-mixes his new vocal so that it again dominates, so the track sounds like a good outtake from \\"Bigger Bang\\". The only objection - where is the alternate take of \\"All Down\\" that was issued on a 7\\" and several other really good \\"Exile\\" takes that have been bootlegged to death?     This issue is miles ahead of the normal CD that most people have had, and as a double album \\"Exile\\" is much more consistently brilliant than The Beatles' \\"White Album\\". The Stones never got the stew as right before or since. I'm glad we can enjoy it so much more than they apparently do. They really should let a complete stranger - I'll volunteer - go through their recordings and pick the best takes and unreleased songs and do a killer box set. They are blind in both ears to their own work.
0596007124|4.0|This is a good book for you if you don't have much experience in Design Patterns. It approaches the theme by introducting the basic concepts and how to apply them in Java language. The only critic I have is that this book like many others should come with practical examples. That's why I didn't give it 5 stars.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|Great buy for a fantastic movie with great actors, singing and amazingly entertaining.  I will watch it over and over...love it!!!
B003BKF696|5.0|I'm a fairly new convert to the music of The National, but after listening to their latest album, I'm ready to explore the rest of their catalog including 2006's \\"Boxer\\" which didn't make much of an impact on me the first time I listened to it.  High Violet is an album that is awash in sorrow and angst.  The lyrics are dark, vivid and haunting, the arrangements are simple and stark and the melodies are subtle.  Matt Berninger sings each song in an ominous baritone that somehow manages to create a sense of despair while simultaneously enveloping the listner in a blanket of warmth.  It takes a truly gifted band to make sadness sound so comforting, and The National do it effortlessly.  I have no idea if the band will break through to the mainstream as some critics and fans are no doubt hoping they will with this album.  Even if they don't, they have positioned themselves at indie rock's front ranks and delivered one of the year's most beautifully hypnotic albums.
B0001XPY1G|5.0|I really enjoyed what I consider the Very Best of the Jacksons.  It combined a litany of music that they made after the name-change.  It was definitely worth purchasing and a listen to it all the time, especially when I'm driving.
B0039SFKSW|5.0|Amazing albulm!  I am always impressed the way John Wetton and Geoff Downes keep cranking out great songs and CDs.  Another great CD from a great band and musicians.
0307266303|4.0|Christopher McDougall has written more than a book just for runners.  In Born to Run he reviews not just the world of Ultra Running (racing from 50k to 100 miles) but shares his perspective, the stories of other runners and the culture of the Raramuri or Tarahumara of the Copper Canyon.  I also found his research in anthropology and evolutionary biology much more interesting and novel than I expected with some proposed explanations for our upright posture, lack of fur, foot structure, etc. all based on new theories.<br /><br />Men and Women are born to run with our evolutionary advantage developed over millions of years and only recently set back by poor shoe design, supersized meals, and convenience life style.  The book is not burdened by these insights and revelations but supported by them and the story of the characters climaxes with a riveting race at the end of the book. I highly recommend this book to runners or anyone interested in fitness, health and the evolutionary background of our species.
B003LXSY60|1.0|I have never felt compelled to write a review on Amazon. After reading how critics love it, fans love it, everybody loves it I decided that I had provide another point of view. Simply put, this album sucks. That is an opinion of course, but what made me love the Black Keys is no longer present with the band. It started to fade with Attack and Release and has now completely disappeared. I really like Rubber Factory - it got me into the Black Keys -  but I think the simplicty of Magic Potion was the best. Big Come Up was great, Thickfreakness was great. Attack and Release had two really good songs. I bought Dan's album and wasn't impressed. It grew on me a little but I still think it lacks the Black Keys energy.    Anyways, if you liked Dan's solo album, you will love this. It is slow, steady, lifeless, and for the most part boring. If you on the other hand like raw, simple music full of energy, don't buy this.     To the BK's credit, they have been doing this for awhile. They don't want to keep playing the stripped down rock/blues forever. I had just hoped that when they matured their sound they wouldn't lose their raw energy. They did.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|I wasn't around when The Stones originally released Exile, but after listening to the \\"lost\\" tracks, I can only imagine what it must have been like when Exile was first released.  My favorite song on the 2nd disc is Plundered My Soul (...I thought you wanted my money, but you plundered my soul...).    I only wish there were more tracks on the 2nd disc.
B002GHHHPQ|5.0|Very satisfied with condition of product and arrival time after purchase. Would purchase from this site again.
B002GZQYMK|5.0|This album is not like other Muse albums.  It has more of a Queen sound to it, but nonetheless it's still worth the purchase.  You can't go wrong with Muse.
B00004W55E|5.0|I purchased this CD when it was first released, but I lost it.  Her voice is amazing.  Her brother is singing a duet with her on this CD, amazing.
B003LFLOOW|2.0|If you want to watch this just for the sake of the special effects, you'll need a sense of humor to endure. It's really quite sad, this had the potential of being an outstanding movie, setting the bar for some of the best CGI ever. Unfortunately, the rest of the movie was a disaster. The only thing that kept me watching was to see more of the stunning graphics. Some of the negatives include, predictability, ( I've seen this movie before, many times before) horrendous dialog, poor character development, and throughout the story there are these interwoven politically correct themes so blatant it was enough to make one vomit. The only thing that kept me and my family sane through this thing was to make jokes and laugh at the silly stereotyping, oversimplifications,  and Hollywood, head up your butt mentality that ruled. Hollywood may still have money, and a source of great CGI talent, but where is the soul and depth of good story telling that doesn't insult our intelligence? This movie personifies the \\"just another movie with a pc agenda\\" more than any I have seen in a long time.  Glad I had a free coupon, and didn't actually pay to watch it.
B000025XKM|4.0|Leads off with the best song.  I wonder, could this guy really sing or not?
B002RVZV9K|5.0|I grew up on Zeppelin and it is so wonderful to hear Jimmy Page talk about music and how it shaped him. Such a warm presence in this film. Some say that there isn't enough music in the movie, and I would disagree. I think there might be just a bit too much. I would rather hear them talk more. You know that Page alone must have days of stories to tell.<br /><br />Jack White comes off as maybe a bit ostentatious in this grouping, but he has very real and original artistic talent. I have much more admiration for him after having seen this. And I think some of his airs are simply the effects of being included in such tremendous company.<br /><br />The Edge gives some good first-hand background on the forming of U2. Their music in recent years has not captured me, as they've gone away from clean sounds and moved more toward electronic effects. But it's nice to hear him talk, even if maybe a third of what he has to say is about the various hardware he relies on for the effects that make their current sound.<br /><br />It was very moving to see the warmth and respect each of these three afforded the others. However, it is very clear who the god among men is, and shivers went down my spine when Page stood up and ripped into the Whole Lotta Love riff. You can see the awe in the eyes of both The Edge and White. They truly look caught in the moment and unable to hide their sheer excitement like a kid on Christmas morning. To think that this riff is likely one of the first riffs either of the younger guitarists ever learned, and they're playing with The Man.
0937381888|5.0|Along with so many other reviewers who have purchased this book, I can recommend Palmer's book for homebrewers. As a new brewer I've discovered that there probably isn't any book out there that answers all questions, but this one holds an amazing amount of information for both the extract brewer and the all-grain brewer. The lay-out is such that it involves a bit of hopscotch, not necessarily a bad style. I find Papasian's book to be warmer and fuzzier and more encouraging for a first time homebrewer, but Palmer's is definitely a must-have on the shelf.
B0038BBA4I|5.0|I bought this yesterday, thinking I liked the samples.  I have listened to it all the way through at least 7 or 8 times by today.  Its folky, but there is still something for everyone here.  The harmonies are great, good story lyrics, great crescendos and a little rock and roll.  By the way, I probably have 60GB of music and this my first review.  Stunning stuff.
0307266303|5.0|If you run distance this is a must read. Great book, great education and very inspiring
B0039TD7RC|3.0|Of course this is a 5-star album, but I already have the album. Compared to other Deluxe Editions from this period (the Who Sell Out, Who's Next, [[ASIN:B00005NB0H Live At Leeds [Deluxe Edition]]]), the documentation is really scant. The 12-page booklet advertised is basically album credits and some photos from the recording sessions. A little essay or something talking about the circumstances surrounding this \\"exile\\" (hello? the Stones take off to a French Chateaux to record an American-blues-style album?) would not have been that hard to pull together. The extra songs are amazing, but still--these special editions are supposed to be keepers (see Live at Leeds, etc.) as opposed to CD's you put on your iPod and then toss into the garage.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|The Forgotten Garden has a little of everything. Romance, Mystery and Family ties. Couldn't put it down. Highly recommend. You won't be disappointed.
B00177Y9ZM|5.0|Jumper is a fun movie with exciting graphics and special effects. There are witty remarks amidst the action and suspense. It's got the typical characters: handsome burdened hero, pretty girl who needs rescuing, bad-bad guy, funny sidekick.     It is an anytime movie. A touch of sci-fi, cool enough to be mainstream.
0393072231|4.0|Michael Lewis is a master stylist and \\"The Big Short\\" is a very interesting and engaging read that is impossible to put down. I found myself glued to the narrative, which is well-organized, explains every nuanced financial detail, and follows a group of characters, though not the biggest winners in the shorting the housing bubble, certainly were successful in doing so. One criticism is that the book tries to make heroes of people who were capitalizing on other investor's misery. Is that smart and prescient investing, or simply vulture capitalism? Each reader has to decide, but nowhere in the book does Lewis make this judgment against his subjects. I've heard there is a movie deal for this book, and I'm sure that more barbs will be thrown at the main players then. But there is no denying that this book will enlighten readers about the complex inner workings and failures of the American financial system.[[ASIN:0393072231 The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine]]
B001GKJ2E8|5.0|Action packed, rarely a dull moment (except when trying to portray a dull moment). Keeps you on the edge of your seat. That edgy acting with distinctive characters similar to Snatch or Fight Club.
0143113100|4.0|Neuroplasticity.    The idea that our brains are fixed, hard-wired machines was (and in many cases still is) so deeply entrenched in the scientific establishment that evidence to the contrary was not only suppressed, but often not even seen because the minds of even respectable scientists could not absorb what they were certain was impossible.  Having been familiar since the 1960s with the work of Glenn Doman and the Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential, the idea that the human brain is continually changing itself and can recover from injury in astonishing ways did not surprise me. In fact, the only shock was that in a 400 page book on neuroplasticity and the persecution of its early pioneers I found not one mention of Doman's name. But the stories are none the less astonishing for that.    In Chapter 1 we meet woman whose vestibular system was destroyed by antibiotic side-effects.  She is freed by a sensor held on her tongue and a computerized helmet from the severely disabling feeling that she is falling all the time, even when lying flat.  That's the stuff of science fiction, but what's most astounding is that the effect lingers for a few minutes after she removes the apparatus the first time, and after several sessions she no longer needs the device.    Chapter 3, \\"Redesigning the Brain,\\" on the work of Robert Merzenich, including the ground-breaking Fast ForWord learning program, is worth the cost of the book all by itself.    Sensitive readers may want to steer clear of Chapter 4, \\"Acquiring Tastes and Loves,\\" or risk being left with unwanted, disturbing mental images.  But it is a must read for anyone who wants to believe that pornography is harmless, or that our personal, private mental fantasies do not adversely affect the very structure of our brains.    The book is less impressive when it gets away from hard science and into psychotherapy, as the ideas become more speculative, but the stories are still impressive.    Phantom pain, learning disabilities, autism, stroke recovery, obsessions and compulsions, age-related mental decline, and much more:  the discovery of neuroplasticity shatters misconceptions and offers hope.  The Brain that Changes Itself is an appetizer plate; bring on the main course!
0385340990|4.0|This was a really fun book! It's written in the form of letters and uses (for the most part) believable plotlines to get all the \\"necessary\\" information into these various letters. It's written about the time immediately after World War II and much of the \\"action\\" takes place on the little-known island of Guernsey, loc...ated in between France and England. The primary theme was probably how literature and language (writing letters and books, reading books and talking about them) can bring people together, which is of course one of my favorite themes even if it is a bit overdone.<br /><br />I found this book relaxing to read and was quickly swept up into it, which is actually more than I can say for a lot of the stuff book clubs are reading these days. And because all of the letters were so short, it was really easy to read a little bit here and there, even if I didn't have a lot of time. So yeah, I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone looking for a semi-light but still quality read.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|I just love the musical production on this project. The ingenuity, the creativity, the style, the grace, and most notably Janelle's sweet voice. She blends so many styles to create a unique concoction comparable to a magical potion that puts the listener under her spell. I am absolutely captivated.    I implore anyone reading this to purchase this album at once as not to feel like the last to discover such a great artist.
0316044938|4.0|I honestly don't know what to say about this book. I'll begin by saying that when the major plot twist occurred at the end, I was knocked a little off-balance and had a few seconds of subconsciously wondering if I could \\"follow the author\\" down that particular path. But then I realized how readily I had followed her down the path of observing earth through the eyes of a murdered girl, and it rang so true psychologically that I almost didn't think of it as a fantastical plot. So that brings me to my first point: The characters seem very real and well-developed. Each character's journey to process their grief was interesting and added a lot to the story.<br /><br />That being said, the reason I don't know what to say about this book is that it didn't leave much of a \\"lingering impression\\" in my mind now that I'm done reading it. It was engaging, thought-provoking, and sometimes even powerful while I was reading it but now that I'm done with it, I'm just ready to pick up another book. Maybe that says more about my current state of mind than about the book itself; maybe I just need to process it more. But I guess it just seems to me that all of its excellent small points didn't add up to anything in the end.<br /><br />Or perhaps I'm just not satisfied with the book's \\"conclusion.\\" The title comes from the following quote (Susie Salmon, the murdered girl, is the first-person narrator):<br /><br />\\"These were the lovely bones that had grown around my absence: the connections - sometimes tenuous, sometimes made at great cost, but often magnificent - that happened after I was gone. And I began to see things in a way that let me hold the world without me in it. The events that my death wrought were merely the bones of a body that would become whole at some unpredictable time in the future. The price of what I came to see as this miraculous body had been my life.\\"<br /><br />So basically, she comes to realize that her death deeply affected her family members and friends (obviously), and that their lives ended up being a deep, rich tapestry of human existence that perhaps they wouldn't have been had she not been murdered. Goodness--and even magnificence--came out of Susie's death.<br /><br />When I type this out, I wonder why this conclusion doesn't satisfy me. It's certainly something I agree with: Horrible tragedies can result in depth and magnificence and beauty. Is it just that the conclusion seems so obvious? Even trite? (Maybe I should have thought more about this book before writing a review on it!)<br /><br />I'm going to conclude lamely--much like The Lovely Bones--and just say that I have mixed feelings about the book. It's definitely worth reading though, and you probably won't be able to put it down because it's such a page-turner!ded up being a deep, rich tapestry of human existence that perhaps they wouldn't have been had she not been murdered.

B001EOQWF8|5.0|In my opinion, it is not worth the money to buy this DVD, unless you don't mind paying for something you only use once.  My kids were dying to see this movie.  I bought the DVD hoping it would provide hours of enjoyment for them.  They liked watching it the first time, and each time I have tried to turn it on after that, they don't give it any attention.  Cute movie, just a little boring the second, third etc.. time around.      (The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

031606792X|1.0|Breaking Dawn ruined the Twilight Saga experience for me.  I fell in love in Twilight (screaming \\"Why aren't men more like Edward?!\\" the entire time), was deliciously heartbroken in New Moon (screaming where the *%#* is Edward?! the whole time), and rejoiced throughout Eclipse (screaming \\"What the *&#% is wrong with you, how could you even THINK about being with someone besides Edward?!\\" the entire time).  Obviously, the first three books brought out some fairly strong emotions in me.           As a 36-year-old with a bachelor's degree in literature, I agree that even the first three books had their eye-rolling moments. (\\"Before you, Bella, my life was like a moonless night.\\"  Oh, brother!)  But I suspended criticism of the repetitive language and overly dramatic and sappy prose while keeping in mind that the main character begins at seventeen years old.  I work with teenagers every day, and I know that they are prone to overdramatic speech and that they have a tendency toward martyrdom, both of which were problems that readers had with Bella from the beginning.  I felt those personality traits made her more relatable as a teenager.  I had suspended more than a few misgivings about the writing before I got to the third book simply because I truly loved the story and had more than a little literary crush on Edward.         Midway through Breaking Dawn, I was annoyed with Edward and could no longer relate to Bella at all.  Let me repeat one part of that statement: I was ANNOYED with Edward.  The character who previously could do no wrong to me, the character I envisioned in every possible detail in my mind, the character who starred in more than one guilt-inducing dream of mine had started to get on my nerves.  That, I think, is where the author failed.  The whole fan frenzy began and grew because of Edward's character.  He was the crush I had in high school, the giddiness I hadn't felt in years, the unexplainable and overwhelming need for romance inside every woman who picks up a novel of the genre.  That is my biggest problem with Breaking Dawn.  I was afraid to read it because I knew when it was over I had to let go of that feeling.  By the middle of the book, that feeling had been sapped out of me already.  The magic was gone.
B002VECMAE|4.0|Criticisms of the film adaptation of Jon Ronson's book \\"The Men who stare at Goats\\" are that it doesn't quite work as a narrative and fits no neat \\"genre\\" category. Is it serious drama exploring the US military's investigation of the paranormal for operational use? Is it satire, comedy, buddy-movie or what? A resemblance to early Coen Bros movies can be seen in the quirky characters, committed acting with delicious black comedy moments, sudden violence, and unpredictable plot twists. The viewer is left however with the feeling of a whole less than the sum of its parts, the result less-than-satisfying drama. But the film is nevertheless enjoyable and instructive, and worth seeing for several reasons. It deserves a place on the shelf alongside \\"Dr. Strangelove,\\" \\"Catch 22\\" and \\"Oh What a Lovely War\\" as a satire on the military mindset, but \\"The Men Who Stare at Goats\\" is unique.<br /><br />The raw material was supplied by British journalists Jon Ronson and John Sergeant's tongue-in-cheek investigation of the US military's secret projects exploring mind control, telekinesis, telepathy, remote viewing and methods of unconventional combat carried out in special units from the 1970s to the 1990s with varying degrees of success. The film's fictional plot is set in the early part of the 2003 Iraq war (though that war is not the film's subject, and it's not an overtly political tract). The story of the \\"New Earth Army\\" and their extraordinary activities is told in flashback through the experience of the Ewan McGregor character, a naive young journalist looking to prove himself after his wife leaves him by finding and writing up a big story in the danger zone. In the rooftop bar of a Kuwait hotel he meets Lyn Cassady (George Clooney), ex-NEA warrior now middle-aged but still steeped in the belief system generated during his years spent in the \\"special unit\\" at Fort Brag.<br /><br />McGregor, Clooney, Bridges and Spacey each bring commitment and comedy to their roles, with Clooney and Bridges particularly good. Clooney is convincing as the clearly unhinged and delusional Cassady, just sane enough to be right some of the time with some genuine hit-and-miss psychic abilities and hilariously funny. Think Ulysses Everett McGill from the Coens' \\"O Brother Where Art Thou?\\" told by the military that he has exceptional paranormal powers and is greater than the average human in capabilities. For the character played by Bridges we have \\"The Dude\\" from \\"The Big Lebowski\\", transposed wholesale into a position power in the US Army, complete with long plaited hair and fully-formed new-age philosophy so confidently expressed that he steps effortlessly into the role of Warrior-Monk-Leader-of-Men. Bridges' scenes are almost all in flashback as the inspiration and mentor of the original New Earth Army team at Fort Brag back in the day until the final part of the film when he pops up again in the current narrative older, diminished in confidence and stature, now working for scheming and malevolent former student Spacey's successful private company in Iraq.<br /><br />The story follows Clooney's and McGregor's characters from one gun-wielding (sometimes gun-firing) encounter to the next through a Road-to-Baghdad buddy-movie format with the history of the NEA episodically filled-in in by Clooney's revealing narrative to McGregor. The comedy lurches from brilliance to slapstick and back again, with real laugh-out-loud moments. The denouement, where NEA philosophy finally defeats current military-political paradigms is visually spectacular and in its own way logical but less than completely convincing.<br /><br />Much of the film's detail about the paranormal goings-on at Fort Brag over the years is reported to be pretty accurate. The zealous belief of the Bridges and Clooney characters (and others) in the fundamental value of what they are doing and their inherent superiority to those living a more mundane existence is very funny and well realised. All theseactors do comedy well.<br /><br />Although a film with a more coherent narrative line and better editing might have been made, \\"The Men Who Stare at Goats\\" is worth seeing for the joy of the ensemble cast hamming it up, some genuinely hilarious scenes and the mind-blowing realization that the US military, with its enormous taxpayer-funded budgets, takes all this paranormal strangeness quite seriously and has devoted considerable resources into the development of effective \\"psychic warriors\\". The US Army really has trained men in \\"remote viewing\\" and to try to kill goats with mind-power, and may even as you read this be engaged in developing methods of alternative psychic warfare in ways you can't even imagine.though a film with a more coherent narrative line and better editing might have been made, \\"The Men Who Stare at Goats\\" is worth seeing for the joy of the ensemble cast hamming it up, some genuinely hilarious scenes and the mind-blowing realization that the US military, with its enormous taxpayer-funded budgets, takes all this paranormal strangeness quite seriously and has devoted considerable resources into the development of effective \\"psychic warriors\\".

0525421580|5.0|This book focuses on the story of two teenagers, both named Will Grayson. Each author writes from the point of view of a Will Grayson, alternating narration and characters as the story goes on. Both authors are able to describe this time in a teenager's life perfectly. They artfully communicate the wide range of feelings teenagers have during these years. The authors capture these complex relationships -platonic and romantic- realistically. The characters they create are so true and believable that you can't help but turn the pages to see what happens to them next.    The wonderful plot of this story made it hard for me to put the book down. It starts out as two characters in contrasting situations. The path they take to each other is very different compared to anything I've experienced, while still being something I found myself relating to. The main story of love is not only something that affects teenagers, it affects everyone.    Review: I read a lot of young adult (YA) books. Often I read these books for purely entertainment purposes. Most of the YA books I read help me escape from my life for a bit, to an enjoyable place free of the every day stresses of an adult. In the most wonderful way possible, Will Grayson, Will Grayson is not that type of YA book. All around an amazing book that is a must-read.

I thought the book wasted too much time in the personal stories of the key characters and not enough time presenting hard facts regarding how the financial crisis evolved.  The personal stories were rambling soliloquies.  The quotes contained gratuitous vulgarities, which did not add quality or context to the story.
061891868X|4.0|For a retired physics  teacher, who now engages in online math and physics tutoring, Smolin's book is a heads-up that stimulates thinking about the recent three decades of physics.  He makes a strong case about the failure of physics to come up with a new paradigm.  And his suggestion that social forces or prejudices limit progress of creative individuals brings our discipline into the human arena along with any other professions that suffer similar restrictions by entrenched human attitudes.  Carefully written, thought-provoking, sometimes repetitive.
B002WPVNZM|4.0|How is it that the song \\"Good Life\\" doesn't have an explicit label on it? The whole purpose of the label is to keep parents like me from having our little kids running around the house singing about BS. If a band chooses to swear, that's up to them.

First off, poker wasn't even a big theme in the movie, so the entire inclusion of these elements is a bit iffy. I only picked up this edition because I just so happened to be looking for a deck of playing cards at the time, and figured hey, why not some awesome theme cards? I had no idea what a bad idea that would turn out to be.<br /><br />The poker cards have a nice design, using characters from the films for special cards. The problem is, the cards are completely low-rent and unfinished. They stick together, they don't shuffle well, and the edges don't hold up. There were actually a few bits of paper falling off the cards' edges from the dodgy cutting. The dealer chip is just a piece of low-rent plastic, not an actual poker chip, and the word \\"dealer\\" was already a little rubbed off from the packaging. The scrapbook is just the sort of useless filmographies and biographies that have become infamous in attempts to fill up special editions, and is easily forgotten.<br /><br />After seeing the extra elements, I just trashed them and kept the DVDs. Don't waste your money. If you're going to get this movie, pick one of the regular editions and just get the movie.
B003KTEGG2|3.0|How is it that this album doesn't have an explicit warning? The free song \\"Laredo\\" has an f-bomb dropped in the middle of it. I love the music, but I don't my kids running around the house singing about \\"a kitchen knife f-ed in my face.\\" That's what those explicit warning are for, right?
0887308589|5.0|I first read this book many years ago, when I was much younger and had a much more naive outlook on the world. It made me chuckle, at times even laugh out loud, and I did recognize a lot from my different employers. As I've grown older and more experienced, some concepts from this book stayed with me, and as frightening as it is; it's an accurate description of how the world works.    Yes, managers do get their positions because they have the right look. \\"He's got good hair, we think it will turn silver.\\" Yes, people do get promoted to their level of incompetence. It's a way to control damage. That's why your boss is and always will be an idiot.    The Dilbert Principle might not help you with your hair turning silver; you'd need another type of product for that, but it does help with handling everyday stress and frustration in the workplace. When you can see things from the comical side, it's not all that bad anymore.
0792165020|5.0|The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999)was a great five star film with excellent acting, cast, and needless to say a wonderful script. Those who care about the video quality will also be glad to hear that the film was a very good transfer to DVD.  My wife thought the ending was a little weak, but I didn't agree.  All in all a great drama and mystery.
B00007KWHN|5.0|\\"The Yes Album\\" was a watershed release for Yes, and almost 40 years after the album's initial release, it retains its original energy, inventiveness, and freshness.  A helpful liner-notes essay by Bill Martin makes clear the reasons why \\"The Yes Album\\" was crucial in the group's artistic development, and indeed in the continuation of their career.  Moving beyond the well-played but relatively conventional work of their first two albums, Yes experimented with longer, multi-part song suites; the alternating of long and short songs made for an effective and invigorating mix.  I still like how \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\" begins with Tony Kaye's organ chords seemingly half a step off from the bass-and-guitar riff that begins the song.  Steve Howe's \\"The Clap\\" is an evocative, delightful solo guitar piece.  \\"Starship Trooper\\" boasts soaring vocals by Jon Anderson and muscular bass-guitar stylings from Chris Squire.  \\"I've Seen All Good People\\" has been subjected to 39 years of merciless heavy-rotation overplaying on FM and then \\"classic rock\\" radio, and yet the song is still a delight in its movement from a slow, contemplative beginning to a fast, high-energy conclusion; I just miss the searing drum part that connects \\"Your Move\\" and \\"All Good People\\" on the live version on \\"Yessongs.\\"  \\"A Venture\\" is short, straightforward, well done; this song seems the most like what one might have heard on \\"Yes\\" or \\"Time and a Word.\\"  And \\"Perpetual Change\\" closes off the album well; Bill Bruford's drumming truly shines here, holding the song down reliably through its many tempo changes.  For me, this album makes up part of the essential Yes oeuvre, along with \\"Fragile\\" and \\"Close to the Edge.\\"  Highly recommended for fans of 1970's progressive rock.
0553212419|5.0|It was such a pleasure to revisit some of these classic tales again for the first time since my teenage days.  In addition to being packed full of brilliant stories, I really liked the format of the book as well -- although it's thick (just over 1000 pages) it's small and compact, which is good because you won't be able to put it down and thus will end up taking it with you everywhere you go! At least I did.<br /><br />I saved the first two lengthier stories-- A Study in Scarlet and The Sign of Four-- for rainy evenings and started off with the shorter stories, which can be enjoyed \\"on the go\\", like bite-sized literary treats.  Each tale is entertaining and captivating in its own way and the characters and situations are so brilliantly portrayed that you'll quickly forget you're reading fiction.  Conan Doyle's writing style sweeps the reader back to the days of gas-lit London and makes you feel like you're right in the middle of everything that's happening.<br /><br />The chemistry between Watson and Holmes is just delicious and while each story has a serious element to it, there is lots of humour sprinkled throughout.  I think \\"A Study in Scarlet\\" is one of Conan Doyle's finest achievements as a writer and held me captive until the wee hours of the morning, and that's the sort of thing you want in good fiction.  Looking forward to devouring Volume II.
0891419063|5.0|With the 1st Marine Division at Peleliu and Okinawa campaigns during WW2, Eugene B. \\"Sledgehammer\\" Sledge , was the first private to write his combat experiences in book form, since his enlistment in the USMC on December 1942 through the campaigns at Pelelieu and Okinawa and after VJ-Day on to North China until his rotation home in early 1946. Based on his personal notes taken during boot-camp and the South and Central Pacific battlefields, it is a most revealing and moving description of the horrors, filthy and senselessness of war.<br />I liked it very much and strongly recommend it for those who are interested in the bibliography for HBO's The Pacific TV series, in which the latter was partially based.

B0000524CY|5.0|I choose this rating because the movie is good. What I like about the movie is that in this movie you better brace yourself as one of the all-time spellbinders possesses you all over again. Director William Friedkin and producer/screenwriter William Peter Blatty have revisited The Exorcist to integrate 11 minutes of scenes and images deleted before the film's 1973 release and digitally restore the picture and audio elements. The result is an experience more gripping than ever. Now seen are moments deepening the impact of the performances by Linda Blair, Ellen Burstyn, Jason Miller, Max von Sydow and Lee J. Cobb. They include a “nervous disorder” diagnosis, expansion of Father Merrin's arrival before the ritual, priestly doubts during the ritual, an epilogue with Lt. Kinderman and Father Dyer and most notably, a shattering staircase descent by Regan. Winner of Oscars for Best Adapted Screenplay (by Blatty) and Sound, The Exorcist astonishes time and again like no other movie. What I dislike about the movie is that I wanted to see more of it. I would recommend this movie to other people.
B00316DDWW|5.0|This band will take what you've heard before from rock, alternative, progressive, chew it up and extrude it into something you've never heard before.

But it's a losing battle until two intergalactic bounty hunters arrive, determined to blow the hellish creatures off the planet!

B002C6A6FY|5.0|I love Casablanca and is one of my all-time favorites. While many may label it as a romantic film, I think is something much more than that. Aside from the great performances of Bogart, Bergman, Henried, Reins and all the others, the film has a certain appeal that does not feel dated and makes you want to see it again and again.<br />It's one of those films that must be in any collection because it belongs to that rare class of films that can be called Masterpieces.<br /><br />I've been wanting to buy Casablanca on DVD (I don't have a Blu-Ray player) but the ultimate collector's edition was very expensive as was the 2003 2-disc DVD (which is repackaged in the UCE with a documentary about Jack Warner). Then, Warner reissue that DVD in a  cheaper box and just cost $9,99!!! It was a bargain for a great film. This 2009 DVD is the same as the 2003. The picture is crisp, clear and perfect. No artifacts and only some minor (really minor) grain in some scenes. The audio is crisp without background noises. The extras are excellent with audiocomentaries, documentaries, and more. A must own edition for a must own film.<br /><br />If you don't own Casablanca yet, right now is the best time. This 2009 edition is perfect and really cheap. Buy it now and you'll always have Paris.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|Exile has a well deserved and established place among the greatest rock albums ever (although my own choice for top masterpiece by the Stones is Let It Bleed).  Besides the \\"big\\" songs such as \\"Happy\\" and \\"Tumbling Dice,\\" other tracks such as \\"Ventilator Blues\\" have come to be regarded as classics in their own right.  This anniversary edition probably wouldn't be necessary for fans; the sound isn't that much better than some of the previous editions.  The big thing, obviously, is the ten extra cuts with the deluxe edition.  I'm very appreciative of getting to hear these songs, and they fit in well with the original album.  The two alternate takes of Exile songs, \\"Loving Cup\\" and \\"Soul Survivor,\\" aren't as grand as the takes that ended up on the original album, but they're still good to listen to, and provide an interesting alternative look at the tunes.  As for the other eight songs, I am most impressed by how compatible they are with the original songs.  There's some cross-pollination of ideas, as with how \\"Good Time Women\\" has a passing melodic resemblance to parts of \\"Dice.\\"  The best of the extra cuts - the ones I'll be coming back for the most - are \\"Pass the Wine\\" and \\"Plundered My Soul.\\"  However, I dug everything, even \\"Title 5,\\" the short swamp-blues instrumental that closes things.
0670021652|3.0|A friend recommended this book, as I will be getting married in the next year, and I, like Elizabeth have a lot of reservations about the whole institution. I found this book very mediocre.  Somewhat interesting in the history of marriage, but most chapters just left me bored and waiting to be touched on a deep level. It never happened.  When it came to her finally getting married, it was just a quick blur, with nothing deeply interesting. Sorry, I don't highly recommend this book.
B0039TD7RC|4.0|Everyone should know how wonderful this masterpiece album is. The other reviewers cover that well. The sound on this remaster trumps those of the boxed set I reviewed in 2009. The beginning of Sweet Virginia is beautiful to behold. I ripped Sweet Virginia to the hard drive to see what the wave form would look like. There are a massive number of 0db peaks so it looks like this mastering job may have fallen prey to the loudness war. If you don't know what that is look it up in the Wiki [...]    I'm a die hard Stones collector so I bought the Deluxe, Super Deluxe and the Vinyl editions of this. I would have bought them regardless. BUT as one of the other reviewers said I think Mick and Keith already knew that.     So I give it 4 stars for the masterpiece that it is and one star off for the loud mastering.
B000E1OI7G|5.0|My personal feelings for `Traffic' as a whole have had quite the yo-yo effect.  When I first saw the film I really loved it.  Over time my adoration has dwindled but upon a recent viewing I have come to respect it more than I think I ever have.  While it is still a flawed work and one that I don't consider a major triumph, I feel as though the ambitious nature of the film is worth applauding and consider it a very integral part of this past decade.<br /><br />The film tells three separate stories that overlap telling a fuller story concerning the war on drugs here in the US.  We have the newly appointed government drug czar, Robert Wakefield, who struggles with his new assignment as well as with his wayward daughter Caroline, who has a serious drug habit of her own.  We also have Helena Ayala, the beautiful yet naïve wife of a recently incarcerated drug-kingpin.  And then we have Javier Rodriguez (Benicio Del Toro in his Oscar winning role), the conflicted police officer who serves as the films moral center; one of shifting focus and impending consequence.<br /><br />While at times it feels as though it bites off more than it can chew, there is so much going on here that it seems to more than make up for its faults.<br /><br />The acting here is pretty much sensational.  Del Toro is the standout, delivering a natural and completely inhabited performance, but he is not the only actor at the top of their game.  Michael Douglas, who is not an actor I am overly fond of, delivers his best performance, in my humble opinion, as a concerned parent folding under the pressure or raising awareness as well as a daughter.  Speaking of that daughter, Erika Christensen is simply brilliant here.  The way she constructs her characters addiction is heartbreaking and sincere.  This film is all about grit and realism and she masters that with her beautifully tragic performance.<br /><br />Don Cheadle, Dennis Quaid, Topher Grace and Catherine Zeta-Jones only form a small fraction of this talented cast.<br /><br />The true star of the show here is director Steven Soderbergh.  With a film that tries to do so much, Soderbergh keeps throwing it at us, visually as well as thematically.  Where the script may drop the ball or find itself (at times) bogged down, Soderbergh makes sure that the visual feast before us is captivating yet raw and unnerving.  While I would not have handed him the director award myself, I totally understand why he got it.  He takes each story and builds its own separate mood and feel yet ties each story in, creating a cohesive and complex portrayal of human interaction and suffering.<br /><br />There is a universal `flow' that permeates this film and makes it work even when it technically shouldn't.<br /><br />So, in the end I highly recommend this.  My rating is back to an A because, despite its flaws, `Traffic' is a great film that works to its strengths and delivers in the end.  It is a film that definitely understands its subject and it is something we can appreciate and glean from even now, ten years down the road.star of the show here is director Steven Soderbergh.

6305903182|4.0|I'm a pretty big fan of the whole `slasher' genre.  I know that isn't a very credible cinematic choice, but there is something about the whole `killer on the loose' thing that excites me.  No other `slasher' film has reached the heights of `Scream', and while neither of the sequels matched the originals pure bite, the third (and final chapter...until next year that is) film manages to reign in the mediocrity of the second offering and deliver a very satisfying (and thrilling) ride.<br /><br />The film plays out with a group of actors being stalked by a masked killer very reminiscent of the killer who has been stalking poor Sydney Prescott for two other films now.  Seems like Sydney can never catch a break.  Regardless of the fact that she's uprooted her life and moved away, she is still being terrorized.  While the tacky movie series chronicling her horrors is being filmed (they are already onto their third film), Sydney finds herself once again a victim and soon everyone around her is, once again, turning up dead.<br /><br />For me, the second film felt a bit flat.  I know that a lot of people raved it, and it had some interesting twists, but in the end I felt that the ending was forced and unconvincing and unsatisfying, and there was an overall darkness to the film that I didn't really enjoy.  I love dark and scary, but one of the greatest things about `Scream' was that it was terrifying while still managing to poke fun at itself.<br /><br />It had wit.<br /><br />Thankfully, this third offering has regained some of that charm.  It doesn't nail every nuance, like the original film does, but it snaps back with some freshness.<br /><br />I'm happy to see that Neve Campbell will be working again.  I wish that she could nab some roles that were not `Scream' related, but for some reason no one else has aknowleged her talent, at least not lately.  Hopefully we can see a Campbell resurgence after `Scre4m' hits theaters.  She really is a talented young woman and she nailed these films effortlessly.<br /><br />With a fresh cast featuring returnees like Cox, Arquette and Schreiber not to mention new blood like Dempsey, Foley, Mortimer, Posey and McCarthy' `Scream 3' is definitely worth the time of any `slasher' film enthusiast!a fresh cast featuring returnees like Cox, Arquette and Schreiber not to mention new blood like Dempsey, Foley, Mortimer, Posey and McCarthy' `Scream 3' is definitely worth the time of any `slasher' film enthusiast!
B001FB55L2|2.0|Maybe I went into this moving with the wrong expectation.  From the previews, it made it look like a war hero goes missing and his left behind wife falls in love with his brother.  When he returns and everyone discovers that he is not dead, the fight for the wife begins because her heart now belongs to another.  This was TOTALLY not the storyline at all!!    The acting was excellent which is why I gave the movie two stars.  Other than that, it was a poor storyline and a waste of good talent.  The love between the husband and wife was not developed enough before Toby's character gets shipped off to war and is presumed dead.  When his brother, an ex-con, steps in to look after his brother's presumed widow the viewer feels more of a connection between the two because they share more screen time and had more of a character development.  Toby returns home from the war a little on the psychotic side with random violent acts of rage that pretty much carry on until the end of the movie.  The film finally ends with no resolve to his issues nor indication of what is next, what happened to him, or where he has been.  I was highly disappointed.
B00005ASOC|3.0|Gus Van Sant is a strange director, in my opinion.  He goes for the guts one minute, staying true to his vision as a director and creating something that, while not wholly embraced, is at least admirable and then the next minute gets so commercial that any essence of his vision as a director is lost in the mix.  Sadly, you can't watch a film like `Good Will Hunting' or `Finding Forrester' and think they were made by the same guy who made such masterpieces as `To Die For' or `Elephant'.<br /><br />That said, `Finding Forrester' (and to a slightly greater extent `Good Will Hunting') are not bad films, but underwhelming and generic ones.  Some have given Van Sant credit for not making this `could be disaster' a complete clich&eacute;, but it's not like he breathed any freshness into it either.<br /><br />It's serviceable.<br /><br />On a dare, Jamal (a basketball player who can also write very well) sneaks into the apartment of a former famous author named William Forrester.  Forrester has become a reclusive grump of a man but this fluke meeting brings the two together.  Soon Forrester is helping Jamal hone his craft, giving him inspiration and proving to be a great `friend' in the end.<br /><br />Yeah, it's kind of schmaltzy no matter what anyone wants to tell you.<br /><br />The film has its moments, and it is a tad more honest and less clich&eacute;d (although Abraham's entire character is a clich&eacute;) as `Good Will Hunting' BUT the former had some fantastic performances that truly elevated the lackluster film.  This film, while containing some talent (I mean, Connery, Paquin and Abraham are all Oscar winners), fails to really capitalize on those strengths.  The performances are solid, but nothing revolutionary.  The best performance in the film comes from the one non-actor (well, Busta Rhymes isn't an actor either), Rob Brown, who carries the film with an earnestness reminiscent of Matt Damon's portrayal of Will Hunting.<br /><br />In the end, `Finding Forrester' is a tad too conservative to come from a man who has a following for throwing that said conservation out the window.  No, we should expect to see layers to an auteur and so we shouldn't expect every film to `feel' the same, but this doesn't feel like a film from a polished director.<br /><br />This kind of feels like `The Blind Side'.g for throwing that said conservation out the window.

B0035J6TA8|5.0|From my \\"music I can't live without\\" files.  I started hearing cuts from this album several months ago on Dig Radio (out of Australia - they are a fantastic station which you can hear on the net).  Each tune is an interpretation of someone elses music.  The texture he has adopted is medium minimalist, using only his evocative voice and a paired down musical support, mostly orchestral.    For me this is definitely the recording of the year.  Totally outstanding, deeply emotional, fresh, shot through with vivid and rich colors.  I can't recommend this incredible album enough.  The editing and crafting of symphonic sounds are crystal clear. I should only wish that classical pianists could have their pianos sound so inviting.  You won't be disappointed by this musical wizard.

B0039TD7RC|5.0|Long after its inital release, EXILE ON MAIN STREET gained in critical acclaim, finally finding the statis of the Stone's best album, or at least in the top two or three in ANY Stones fans' list.  So, after all these years, here we are with another album's worth of songs. WHA?!?!  Okay, anyone with the Stone's studio sessions in a book could find out that songs by these names were recorded, but only rare bootlegs had some of these songs before, and none in this audio quality,  obviously.  First, let me say the mastering job done sounds clean, clear and  rockin, which is just what The ROLLING STONES' BEST deserves.  EXILES textures move from acoustic piano or acoustic guitar, into \\"everything and the kitchen sink\\" production quality. So I'm pleased with the compression, and overall volumn.  As for the album itself, what can you say about a classic, that is a cornerstone along with the Beatle's WHITE ALBUM, and Dylan's BLONDE ON BLONDE, as the top trio of \\"double LPS\\", that defined the spectrum of Rock as art, even to this day.  EXILE ON MAIN STREET, for all the Dionysian, dark druggy excesses which inspired its work, actually has a very spiritual center, which speaks in most of the songs, subtley or directly. LOVING CUP can be seen as a communion cup, and \\"JUST WANNA SEE HIS FACE\\" is out and out southern gospel.  The album has a stax horn sound, soul singers, Nicky on piano, and the Stone's at the pinacle of their career. Mick and Keith attempted to reproduce all the varieties of rock, that the Stone's had either invented or mastered by \\"71.  We're talking a huge variety of styles, from R & B, Carribean reggae, Soul, Blues, Electric boogie, Stax-Vox, Country, jazz rock, and good ole Chuck Berry Rock and Roll.  On this album, the Stones cemented their reputation as the world's Greatest Rock and Roll Band. That's EXILE ON MAIN STREET as we knew it til today.<br /><br />Now, we have another album's worth of music.  Where has this been for the last 40 years? Well, the first song, PASS THE WINE (Sophia Loren), had been recorded during the EXILE sessions, mixed, and placed in the final running, under the title of \\"Sophia Loren\\" (no, she's not singing on it.) This song sound's typical of the production style on the rest of EXILE. Stax type horn charts, gospel singers, Nicky's piano work, Mick on harp, etc. Probibly the REAL problem with the song, if there is one, is that it meanders around quite a bit structurally.  There is no natural groove pulling this piece forward, but rather, it almost sounds like the STONES were attempting their version of PROG ROCK.  Seriously.  Still, these new outakes at their worst, are as good or better than the BEST songs from METAMORPHOSIS ( for example I\\"M GOING DOWN, those rockers that were outtakes from BEGGARS BANQUET.)<br />PLUNDERED MY SOUL is the second new song. Here, THE STONES sound a bit like THE FACES.  Their sound is raw, heavy, and rocking. This song could be stuck on side 3 of EXILES and be perfectly at home.  I\\"M NOT SIGNIFYING is the next offering, which also was mixed and in the final running order of EXILE, but was pulled for some reason.  The song starts with a mick singing for a whole verse, to  heavy bluesy piano, then the band kicks in, the song slowly builds from there. Overall, its  somewhat like \\"SWEET VIRGINIA\\". Had it been released on GOATS HEAD SOUP, for example, it might have been considered a major track. It just makes you wonder why the STONES sat on this. After the Signifying song, comes FOLLOWING THE RIVER.  I'll tell you about this song with just two words: \\"MELLOW MICK\\".  The slow, almost melodramatic build up of instrumental texture, gospel choir and wall of sound production, really saves a song that starts out sounding almost sappy, in that early 70's singer- songwriter manner.  It's followed by DANCING IN THE LIGHT. This song is an outtake from the \\"STICKY FINGERS\\" sessions of March 1970.  Its not as heavy in production values, as the EXILE outakes. Instead, DANCININ THE LIGHT is an up tempo rocker, that's my favorite of the new songs so far.  Keith and Mick Taylor's guitars are front and center, ripping it up on this track. Here's where the STONE's live band sound, with just piano, makes its appearance. Its an absolutely cool, Sticky finger's type song. The seventh song is ALLADIN STORY. (Well, they're calling it SO DIVINE, but it was called ALLADIN STORY when written and recorded.) This song has that wierd, psychedelic ambiguity to the lyrics, that go back to Mick's late 60's mentality. Here's another Stone's number with a long history. It was first recorded in March of 1969, along with the early version of SHINE A LIGHT.  The lyrics are filled with religious imagery, and \\"Heaven scented Wine.\\" Its a well built rock song, but with an odd middle eight construction, that moves the song right back to the beginning in an abrupt manner. The lyrics are what stand out here. Either Mick's singing about a woman he's going to \\"Put in her place\\", or it's a tirate against false Messiahs. (a la The Beatle's SEXY SADIE). Mick sings \\"You think your love is so Divine, you think you're the savior of Mankind, but i have better things to do than be your slave.\\" ALLADIN STORY was rerecorded during the EXILES sessions, and given that album's sound. Next, you have the alternate version of LOVING CUP.  This is not just a really slow version of the song, its sounds like a completely different song.  The next alternate take, is better than the version on the album. Dig this...SOUL SURVIVOR sung by KEEF! It's FANTASTIC.  The whole song motors on a slower, more raw and smokey vibe, that matches Keith's vocal timbre perfectly.  Mick's version of the song definately sounds tighter. But then again, when has \\"TIGHT\\" ever been a quality expected from EXILE? (relatively speaking.) GOOD TIME WOMEN is an early version of TUMBLIN DICE, that was recorded during the STICKY FINGERS sessions.  Mick has rewritten lyrics for completed songs before, as when HAVE YOU PAID YOUR DUES turned into STREET FIGHTING MAN a few years before this.  So, its not really a new song, but definately a cool outtake.  The album ends with a one and a half minute instrumental groove, that the Stone's had lying around. If Mick had lyrics for it, it could have developed into a fine song. Chances are, the groove or chord progression turned up later.  It's interesting to hear, but it makes the new \\"album\\" sound  more like a collection of outtakes.<br /><br />So, there you have it. EXILE ON MAIN STREET, extended with another album's worth of material. For Stone's fans, its gold. Aside from the obvious Stone's fanatics, who should get this?  Well, I'd recommend this version over a \\"basic\\" EXILE ON MAIN STREET version to anyone.  People with excess cash,  will gravitate towards the super deluxe vinyl-CD release. One thing is sure, and that's these songs deserve to be counted in the Stone's cannon, or else they wouldnt have needed to release them. The castaways from GOATS HEAD thru EMOTIONAL RESCUE were gathered onto the TATTOO YOU album, and those songs were better than the most the songs off the 70s albums.  So, dont think that because these songs weren't used, you are getting the bottom of the Barrow. You are getting PRIME ERA STONES.  And how bad can that be? Buy it, download it, absorb it thru telepathy, but you GOT to hear these songs.GHT is an up tempo rocker, that's my favorite of the new songs so far.   Keith and Mick Taylor's guitars are front and center, ripping it up on this track. Here's where the STONE's live band sound, with just piano, makes its appearance. Its an absolutely cool, Sticky finger's type song. The seventh song is ALLADIN STORY. (Well, they're calling it SO DIVINE, but it was called ALLADIN STORY when written and recorded.) This song has that wierd, psychedelic ambiguity to the lyrics, that go back to Mick's late 60's mentality. Here's another Stone's number with a long history. It was first recorded in March of 1969, along with the early version of SHINE A LIGHT.  The lyrics are filled with religious imagery, and \\"Heaven scented Wine.\\" Its a well built rock song, but with an odd middle eight construction, that moves the song right back to the beginning in an abrupt manner. The lyrics are what stand out here. Either Mick's singing about a woman he's going to \\"Put in her place\\", or it's a tirate against false Messiahs. (a la The Beatle's SEXY SADIE). Mick sings \\"You think your love is so Divine, you think you're the savior of Mankind, but i have better things to do than be your slave.\\" ALLADIN STORY was rerecorded during the EXILES sessions, and given that album's sound. Next, you have the alternate version of LOVING CUP.  This is not just a really slow version of the song, its sounds like a completely different song.  The next alternate take, is better than the version on the album. Dig this...SOUL SURVIVOR sung by KEEF! It's FANTASTIC.  The whole song motors on a slower, more raw and smokey vibe, that matches Keith's vocal timbre perfectly.  Mick's version of the song definately sounds tighter. But then again, when has \\"TIGHT\\" ever been a quality expected from EXILE? (relatively speaking.) GOOD TIME WOMEN is an early version of TUMBLIN DICE, that was recorded during the STICKY FINGERS sessions.  Mick has rewritten lyrics for completed songs before, as when HAVE YOU PAID YOUR DUES turned into STREET FIGHTING MAN a few years before this.  So, its not really a new song, but definately a cool outtake.  The album ends with a one and a half minute instrumental groove, that the Stone's had lying around.

B0039TD7RC|3.0|It's silly to declare a preference for one Stones record over another. To say \\"Exile\\" is their \\"most adventurous\\" or \\"most creative\\" or \\"most consistent\\" misses, entirely, the beauty of this remarkable album. There's a feeling to it that transcends these mundane distinctions; a spirit of ambivalence to these traditional qualifications and pedestrian standards. The music here simply \\"is\\", existing in its own time and space unlike any other Stones effort. Effort is perhaps a misleading word to use here because these songs all feel as though they've come into being without the slightest bit of effort. They seem to have just materialized out of the moist ether, passively channeled through the corporeal receptors of these really nasty boys. Exile on Main Street is notable for its lack of drama. There's relatively little Sturm and Drang, that effective device found on the best of their other albums - a contrasting of the more menacing, threatening rockers against more lilting, luxurious ballads which works to emphasis the opposed and distinct tone of each. The songs on Exile all seem to be getting along surprisingly well with one another. No jarring tempo shifts or striking volume changes; they've all agreed to play nice.<br /><br />Take the song \\"Happy\\" that jangles and bounces around its cacophonous melodic marsh with all the sincerity and honesty of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir but with none of the absurd smugness that such \\"joyful\\" music usually exudes. It's just uninhibited, unmitigated happiness. This infectious ditty leads right into the wonderfully titled \\"Turd on the Run\\", a rollicking rabble-rouser that cares less about revolution and chaos than it does about getting you on your feet and making you shake what the good lord gave ya. It's then followed by the sublimely earthy grunt of \\"Ventilator Blues\\" that kicks and stomps all over some fantastical bayou of the mind. Puffing out massive breathes of swampy rhythm, thumping and grinding, it soon flows into the vaguely distinct shuffle of \\"Just Wanna See his Face\\", echoing forth from perhaps a mossy shack deep within that misty bog. You see, these tunes are all like puffs and plumes of escaping vapor from an ancient fissure, a passive release of unfathomable heat and energy that's threatening to burst forth catastrophically at any moment, but none the less somehow maintaining a restrained, convivial temperament.<br /><br />The most raucous moments are when blasting backing horns herald a particularly festive boogie on the opener \\"Rocks Off\\", on the joyous \\"All Down the Line\\" and also on the afore mentioned Keith Richards marvel \\"Happy.\\" Song number two, \\"Rip This Joint\\", manages to respect the uptempo country party mood while reveling in the good ol' boy sport of fist fighting. A blazing sax solo keeps the swinging and punching harmless enough fun. \\"Shake Your Hips\\" slides around on a Bo Diddly inspired groove of throbbing guitars, and snapping, popping drums, and is confidently led by a super twangy Mick. \\"Tumbling Dice\\", a well deserved star of this show, pulses with the sweetest funky bass and syncopated drum. An exceptionally catchy blending of intricately interweaving rhythms and soulful choir chants.<br /><br />As for the second disc of newly released material, it's a pleasant mix of sympathetic beats and melodies, with the first extra track, \\"Pass The Wine (Sophia Loren)\\", being way more funky than country blues, and the last track, \\"Title 5\\", a brief sonic curiosity that bypasses cowboy country altogether on its wild trip back from, perhaps, the California surf. \\"Plundered My Soul\\", the second extra tune, is likewise more soul inspired than western leaning, and so it too would be quite out of place on the original release. There are two alternate takes of Exile songs, \\"Loving Cup\\" and \\"Soul Survivor\\", that change relatively little from their originals other than Keith handling vocals on \\"Soul Survivor.\\" It's an interesting switch and works more as an instructional moment than as a transcendent change. The remaining five numbers are in no way to be confused with revelations, lost classics, or unpolished gems. Thematically, any one of 'em could reasonably replace any of the three or four arguably \\"minor\\" Exile tunes (#1. Sweet Virginia, #2. Torn And Frayed, #3. Sweet Black Angel, and #4. Loving Cup), and do so perhaps without severely disrupting the original records genuinely magical flow.<br /><br />This is precisely the thing that I was trying to describe when I started off this comment, the wonderfully satisfying consistency of its complex, eclectic sounds. The sublime unity of this inspired collection of faux American classics is Exile's defining quality. There are no weak moments, no sharp turns, no sudden peaks or plodding valleys. It all gels into a prolonged, hand clapping, jug blowing, whistle tooting good tyme, with everyone blithely smiling through their few remaining well worn, tobacco stained teeth. Countrified sounds at a countrified pace, done right. Real right. Adding to or altering its terrific form just seems foolish and cynical, so there's just no need for this \\"new\\" release, certainly not in this pricier configuration. And really, it's remastered no better than my older remastered \\"collector's\\" edition so I can't tolerate the \\"extra\\" cost. The additional songs neither expand nor deepen the texture and tone of the original album. The skimpy booklet adds virtually nothing of value to the package. The noble Exile On Main Street certainly doesn't need this particular kind of help. In fact, I don't think it ever needed any help of any kind.

B0039TD7RC|4.0|The Rolling Stones' Exile on Main St. is one of the greatest rock and roll albums of all time. It's a five-star album, no doubt about it. However, I'm rating this edition only four stars, because this edition's value, for me, is purely in its bonus tracks.<br /><br />Having listened to a friend's copy, there's something wrong with the new mix of the main disc. Part of the greatness of the original album is the way the vocals were mixed on an even level with the instruments, putting every musician on an equal plain. It's a sprawling, messy album, and none of the songs became hits the way \\"Satisfaction\\" or \\"Brown Sugar\\" did. Fine by me. There's a certain grit and grime that seems to have come from the now legendary circumstances of its recording in that hot, dirty basement in France. There isn't a single thing I'd change about this, but that's what was done to this remastered cd. They cleaned it up a bit, and it doesn't help.<br /><br />People can debate whether adding new vocals and instrumentation to the songs on the second disc was done in the best way possible, but in my opinion it's great. These bonus songs are great, spirited rock and roll - not as good as the proper album, but valued additions to the Stones' catalog nonetheless. I, for one, was very happy to see that these songs are available for individual download. In other words, you don't have to shell out for both discs to get these \\"new\\" stuff. I, for one, am happy to stick with the previous version of Exile on cd, and to supplement it with these new songs. I am very grateful that Amazon didn't pull any of that \\"album only\\" nonsense you so often see on a certain other music-download site.<br /><br />So, overall, this is a very good product, but I have to knock it down one star for robbing a classic album of some of its original power. Four stars for this edition of a five star album. My best advice: download the new stuff, but stick with your old edition of the main album.<br /><br />(Update. My other best advice: Some commenters have noted that the second disc is available separately from Target stores. That version would certainly be a better option than spending unnecessarily for this full set.)oted that the second disc is available separately from Target stores.

1847245560|2.0|I can only say that this follow up was in need of an editor. It has characters that go nowhere, plotlines left unfinished, or never developed and motivations that seem contrived. I think the author had some fabulous ideas that were not fully executed. I find Lisbeth's increasing arsenal of \\"powers\\" unbelievable and almost silly. What was the purpose of the relationship between Harriet and Blomvkist that went no where? There are characters introduced that do not propel the plot or add to our understanding of the main characters. And really in the end the evil was just not evil enough. Considering the outrageuos evil of the prior novel the catalyst of this one was pedestrian and not over the top enough. I am surprised at the lack of critical analysis by other reviewers. No matter how interesting the characters the book still needs to be written in a cohesive understandable manner. I do not blame the author as he died before publication.  I felt like I was reading the draft of a really good book.
0307388921|5.0|First off, this is one of my favorite reads ever. Chuck Palahniuk is one of the most unique writers I've ever encountered. His style is one that is ugly, rich, and full of wit. If you've seen the movies, or read his other books, you know whats in store. I would suggest this to someone who enjoys books by similar writers like Vonnegut.
006441034X|5.0|Howl's Moving Castle might be British author Diana Wynne Jones's best-known novel after it was turned into an Oscar-nominated, animated movie in 2004.  Howl's Moving Castle follows the tale of a young woman named Sophie Hatter.  Or, at least she used to be young, until one day the wicked Witch of the Waste pays a call at that Sophie's family's hat shop.  Before Sophie knows what has happened, she finds that she is a ninety-year-old woman who is setting off to seek her fortune (despite being the eldest of three girls, and, therefore, doomed to failure).  Nothing turns out as Sophie expects, not in the least, as she finds herself the cleaning lady to the wizard Howl.  She is confronted with dubiously-labeled spells in the bathroom, green slime and a fire that is much more than it seems.  Not even his castle is straight-forward, as it moves across the country and has a door that leads to four different places.<br /><br />Diana Wynne Jones is a science-fiction and fantasy writer who has been publishing novels for over thirty years.  Jones specializes in creating worlds rife with magic and adventure.  She appeals to readers not just by writing exciting stories, but she manages to master the difficult craft of making her books witty without lowering the tone of the book.  Jones also creates captivating characters that readers of all ages can fall in love with.<br /><br />I have lost track of how many times I've read Howl's Moving Castle, but I think it's safe to say that the number is in the double digits.  What drew me in the first time I read Howl's Moving Castle was the refreshing take on a fantasy-adventure story.  I think it's safe to say that in the last decade there has been a flood of fantasy stories available, and many of them involve wizards going to school.  And that can get quite dull.  I was delighted at how original this book was.  What has kept me coming back has been the fact that every time I read Howl's Moving Castle, I find myself laughing.  And even though I know quite well how the book is going to turn out, I am always excited to get to the next part and honestly can't put it down.  As a matter of fact, I'm going to have to cut this review short, because I'm almost to one of the most exciting parts now!e well how the book is going to turn out, I am always excited to get to the next part and honestly can't put it down.

0385484518|5.0|After I saw the movie based on this book, I became intrigued and bought it. It isn't a very long read, but the message is very powerful. Having grown up with a family member with ALS, I could relate to the emotions entwined in Morrie's life and last days. It is no wonder that this book is still a bestseller, and is highly suggested by many of my old teachers.

193413712X|5.0|Well, it's about time, I say. For a quiet book by a debut author to get the Pulitzer, sure. But also for me to review this book, finally. I have been reading it over the course of a year, not only because it is a densely descriptive novel (you will need to read sentences, paragraphs, pages, multiple times before their true cumulative effect is realized). I feel that every time I have read it I have discovered something different, that this gem of a novel, teaches me how to see the world around me, how to experience, how to get as close as possible to another perception.     It's like the author knew what he wanted to say, and knew that to accommodate the ways in which the story necessitated form, well, he had to re-create form, make the novel novel... This is what true literature is, methinks: it breaks its own bones with each telling and re-invents itself. This is a dream of a book, it haunts from the very first sentence (a beginning that contains its own ending- nicely done, Mr. Harding) to the very last pages, as you know time will come to a stop. Sad, sure; life is sad. But rejoice in the language, really, there is pure joy to be found in blades of grass, in dragonflies, in an electrified, charged mind. And to those complaining of plot, I hear you. Plot is besides the point, though; at least the author lets us know that that's his deal in the first few pages. Themes of time and memory do not make for a whizboombang potboiler; the suspense is created slowly, surely, from within. The clock, after all, has been wound.     I recently bemoaned the loss of a friend to another friend, and said \\"I feel like I didn't get enough time with him.\\" It was a trans-continental move, not death, that I was talking about, but it struck me that if I could sum up the book, that is how I would say it, that it is about people not getting enough time with life itself, how there is never enough time, how time should, ethically, practically, be depicted as slipping away, and we, poor vulnerable humans, never ever have enough of it.    I think this novel is virtually flawless, inimitable, like a flake of snow, and I'm gratified that it was awarded the Pulitzer. But as swell as that is, this award will hopefully not get in the way of (more) good writing on Harding's part; maybe the award, above all else, served this function: to let a writer know that he should keep doing what he was so painstakingly doing, and to make readers pay him some attention. I like to think as cynical as one can get about awards, that they can be a simple force for good writing to emerge into the light of a new day... Best book of the year... you may not judge it to be so, but is it a novel you should spend some time with? Yes.. And forgive me my passionate repetitions...

0312360266|3.0|The story starts off well.  The main girl is marked to become a vampire while she's attending a regular high school.  As soon as she's marked, she learns she must attend a new school just for vampires.  It seems intriguing at first but fades into witch rituals.  Her human ex-boyfriend still broods over her, apparently for no reason, while she begins a new relationship with a vampire.  I thought the book was about vampires, but it wasn't about that.
B000YDPT4U|5.0|I recently got back into vinyl, starting with the reviving of my old sansui direct drive turntable and a couple of duplicate lp's a friend gave me to trim his collection. one minute into the first song i've played on a turntable in over 20 years, and i was hooked. the sound was absolutely incredible.    in the last 3 months, i have completely overhauled my sound system to bring out the best music i have ever heard, all built around vinyl now rather than cd, although i did include a decent cd player - why waste 20 years of collected music?    using a NAD 326/515 amp/cd player, B&W 685's, and a project debut III, I have what audiophiles would call a low end system (which in audiophile terms isn't a bad thing - most of the components are award winning pieces), and i've never been happier...    this is connected to the compilation in question because as i am starting a new collection, it is very difficult to spend big bucks to get every single album i want on vinyl, and compilations like these, although sometimes \\"lacking\\" in content (sometimes you want to listen to the songs that aren't part of their greatest hits), give you a lot of good songs with absolutely lovely sound. this compilation sounds great (although i haven't had a chance to compare with a good original pressing), and is beautifully packaged - for a price that's less than half of just one led zep album (led zep iv is over a 100 dollars on some sites).    if you have a half decent system and just one or two of their albums (or none at all) on vinyl, you won't go wrong with this set for now. enjoy the music!
B00319ECC4|5.0|Absolutely spectacular album! I would absolutely recommend this album to any heavy music fan! I've been a fan ever since 1998 of Fear Factory, and they 'still' continue to deliver the goods even though they've changed their line-ups several times! 5 stars definately isn't enough, I'd give it a perfect 10!!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This movie is by far my favorite of all time. It's the closest thing to a perfect movie experience that I've ever had. I'm extremely glad this pure version was released early, so fans like me wouldn't have to wait until this fall for the expanded features edition. I'll be getting that also, as soon as it comes out, but by then I'll have enjoyed Avatar numerous times over the summer. Can't wait for the sequel.
B002N1AEN2|5.0|I really love this band. I can listen to this album over and over again. I heard 'Islands' and I have been sold on them ever since. I listened to the entire album and didn't find one song I didn't like. The songs all feel cohesive to me and as if the lyrics were telling us their story. A great 'let it play through' album to chill to..
0452287022|4.0|I really enjoyed this novel.  It is my first Chevalier, but it will not be my last.  She brings the era and the characters alive - up close and personal.  I appreciated her attention to detail and learning about how the artists or at least Vermeer created and mixed his paints to create such vivid detail.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|My 3/5 rating is NOT for the movie itself.  The movie is good and fun to watch but certainly not the best movie ever made.  The 3/5 is for the Blu-Ray release, the product you are buying.<br /><br />What I don't like about this Blu-Ray release is the lack of ANY special features whatsoever.  No trailers, no behind the scenes, no commentary tracks, no interactive or web content.  None.  What you get on the main menu are 3 options.  Play Movie, Settings, and Chapters.  It's nice that they included a DVD copy as well.  It does add to the value of the product, but not enough for me to give it 4/5.<br /><br />Obviously, they are out to milk Avatar for all it's worth since they will be releasing a meatier version later.  Can you blame them?  No.  It's business, and they certainly aren't the only ones to do it.  But since this is a bare-bones release at full price, then it shouldn't get a full quality rating in my opinion.  It's just unfortunate for fans of the movie who want instant gratification to have to buy the movie twice if they want to see all the extras too.  It would be nice if they just released a supplemental disc with the bonus stuff for $10, but you know that won't happen.
030745455X|2.0|I'm going to keep this as short as possible because others have already touched on the weaknesses of this novel, and I'll see if I can add anything. I enjoyed The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo but didn't like this novel. Several reasons:<br /><br />1. Too many points of view. There must be at least a dozen in this novel, and sometimes point of view (in terms of omniscience) changes within the same paragraph.<br />2. As a result, we spend too much time away from the only interesting and unique character: Lisbeth. I really think this would have been a much better story if he had stuck with Lisbeth the whole time, or at least switched off between Lisbeth and Mikael (spending more time with Lisbeth). At one point, Larsson leaves Lisbeth for well over a hundred pages, and when he returned to her, I wondered what he had gained by going away from her. I would have rather seen the story unfold from her point of view.<br />3. About halfway through, he completely forgets about character development, turning this into a plot-heavy procedural in which we're always aware of the author's presence.<br /><br />Disappointing.

B0027BOL4G|4.0|A good movie that looks at the impact of how our food is grown and processed. It is difficult to watch and afterward I was left feeling like I didn't want to eat, or least not purchase meat from a grocery store ever again. My only critique is that it focused a lot on meat and I wish there was more on growing crops. For a similar movie that focuses more on crops watch \\"The Future of Food\\".
2839906171|5.0|This is a wonderfully engaging, entertaining and educating book on the very important but unfortunately less understood concept of \\"business model design & innovation\\". The book does not provide an essentially novel definition for the concept of  business model as such, but the way it handles the concept is simply brilliant and so easy to understand. It first takes the general definition of a business model as \\"the rationale of how an organization creates, delivers and captures value\\" and develops a nine step schema which brilliantly and very legibly covers all FOUR essential areas of any business: Customer, Offer, Infrastructure and Financial Viability (i.e. the profit model). The book then goes on to explaining each one of the nine steps and proposes using a very simple (but extremely clever) BUSINESS MODEL CANVASS to brainstrom around. From there onwards the authors move on to categorise some of the most common business models and explain their workings on the basis of the CANVASS. The examples may be known cases but the way they are explained within the structure of the CANVASS is certainly praiseworthy. Even by  that early point you fall in love with the approach as well as the actual design format of the book. The design of the book is very entertaining and makes it fun to read such an intellectually demanding topic. You find, in the rest of the book, the methods regarding the design of innovative business models and revising your company's strategy on the basis of changing business model environments. This is a lovely book. The way the subject is approached, the way it is modelised, the way it is presented, the participative way the book is written and the easiness of understanding makes it a rare treasure in the area of business literature. I congratulate the authors and all those who took part in the project and extend my sincere thanks to all of them for making me experience such a pleasant, entertaining and enlightening reading.

B003AO1SVS|5.0|I'm compelled were I previously was conflicted. I've been a fan of The Black Keys since their second album, \\"Thickfreakness.\\" I even saw them live when they toured to promote their amazing  follow up and 3rd album, \\"Rubber Factory.\\" To this day, that was one of the most energetic and awesome shows I've ever seen--and I've been to quite a few. However, the years following that were not as golden in my opinion. \\"Magic Potion\\" would have been admissible had it not been for the fact that it was a follow up to \\"Rubber Factory,\\" easily their best album to date. I enjoyed the soulful nature they took with \\"Attack And Release\\" but they weren't exactly back to form in my opinion. After 6 years of trial albums, The Black Keys have brought their fans an album equally if not better than their pinnacle 2004 \\"Rubber Factory\\" album.<br /><br />It's obvious when you listen to the entire album that The Black Keys were trying to accomplish something grand here. It remains in the style of soulful blues that fans came to appreciate from them. However, there is greater diversity in the collection of songs without sacrificing the cohesion. My introduction to the album was \\"Next Girl.\\" It's a short catchy song that I dug immediately. I was a bit taken aback with how The White Stripes it sounded but it was nevertheless the line that reeled me in. Once I got my hands on the rest of the album I was not disappointed. This album is much deeper than the lead single, \\"Next Girl,\\" demonstrates. It's an excellent collection of songs ranging from bouncy (\\"Sinister Kid\\", \\"Tighten Up\\", \\"Everlasting Light\\") to the soulful melodic (\\"The Only One\\", \\"Too Afraid To Love You\\", \\"Never Give You Up\\") and those in between (\\"She's Long Gone\\", \\"Ten Cent Pistol\\"). There is a lot of creativity in this album. \\"Too Afraid To Love You\\" is my jam. Much like with other veteran artist releases this year (Crystal Castles, The National, LCD Soundsystem), I'm not hesitant to say that this is the best album The Black Keys have given us yet.n us yet.

B002ZRPQ5K|1.0|Let me start off by saying I LOVE Keane but hate this CD.   The Rappers should NOT be on the cd it totally ruins it.  This type of music should NOT have RAP on it.  People that LIKE this type of music don't usually listen to rap all that much.  Even putting the Rap aside...this album is still pretty lousy.  What happened to the beautiful songs...that Keane is known for????   Also the vocals are not as good as they usually are with Keane.   I Really and Truely hope this is NOT the direction they are going because if it is, I will be done with this band....which I have followed since the begining.  I was going to go see them in concert until I heard this crap of a cd.  This cd changed my mind and I did NOT buy tickets.  It will be a no go for me until I see what they do with their next album.
B002ZFQD04|5.0|Even in her 50s Madonna is still kicking it out without missing a beat. Sticky & Sweet sees Madonna in a whole new light (as usual). The Queen of ReInvention has taken her tour to totally new places, while at the same time taking a step back to the concert formula that has made her the most famous woman in the world. Her dark Erotica-like opening sequence gives way to a poppy 80s segment. Follow that with a decidely South American/Eastern Eupopean whirlwind, then finishes up with what can only be described as a glimpse in Madonna's sporty futuristic dream sequence (complete with nerdy glasses?).  While I don't think this is Madonna's best concert tour, it certainly does not disappoint. The staging is incredible, the show is fantastic, and lets face it....who puts on a better show than Madonna? No one!
B001EO2UJK|5.0|The only reason to repurchase is audio, and if you are fortunate to have a 5.1 audio system, the dvds reproduce it wonderfully, no need to get the high end sacd set, it all comes down to your home audio system. I wont type here and try to explain the differences, but in a nutshell, it is like hearing brand new music from a cd you have heard literally 1000 times.... i wish other bands would do this type of sound reconstruction, especially the alternative type sounds....all sets are worth getting A++++++++, all sets are wonderfully packaged, a wonderful way to discover the bands music, especially peter gabriel era, the most underrated group of all time, to not make the rolling stone top 500 of all time is a industry travesty, the lamb and selling england should both be in the top 50....enjoy your purchase

B0019N8P2W|2.0|Couldn't wait till the release of Daria, finally the wait was over, all of us fans rejoiced, until I received my copy this week and discovered ALL of the music from the show scrapped!!!, What a let down!, the same show, but no music so upset, to me this wasn't even worth buying, I should have transfered my videos to dvd, and not wasted my time, to the show's creator, what have you done?, it's like taking all the music and music videos out of Beavis And Butthead and replacing with classic music, and making the tv series Glee about a highschool chess club, can we say BORING!!! and so disappointing, you've ruined this for all us hard core fans, I hope everyone else comes to their senses and returns their copies for refunds, it's simply NOT worth buying! Every dvd sold should have been told this BEFORE people ordered this, not After, the dvd should be recalled and be replaced with the original music that made people watch the show.
B003CIG7AE|2.0|For some reason, I had possessed the intuitive theory that credible rock bands with country influences were less susceptible to deteriorations in quality over time: This is probably due to implicit (and naïve) associations with \\"country\\" music as embodying a \\"classic\\" form of music, largely incapable of becoming tainted over time (e.g. The Band, Bob Dylan, etc.).  This is a theory that has not stood the test of time following Band of Horses' three albums.  Despite a remarkably impressive debut on 2006's Everything All The Time, the group backslided somewhat on 2008's Cease to Begin, and the band continues to do on their most recent effort, Infinite Arms.<br /><br />To explain the problematic aspects of Infinite Arms, we first need a brief review of what made Everything All The Time so great: Largo to mid tempos, frequently unintelligible lyrics shrouded in reverb, melodies placed in vocal ranges accessible only by condors, and balls-to-the-wall hail storms of electric guitars.  Conversely, like Cease to Begin, Infinite Arms represents a further \\"disrobing\\" of all the attractive raiment that dressed Everything All the Time so nicely.<br />.<br />For example, the vocal performances are often \\"overexposed\\" by the album's heavier reliance on acoustic guitars, where the band previously benefited from positioning vocalist Ben Bridwell's voice as a \\"signal in the noise\\" of Band of Horse's dust storms of country rock.  Toothless album opener \\"Factory\\" is reminiscent of Herman's Hermits on Quaaludes, in spite the song's featuring the oft employed BoH \\"white boy slow jam\\" rhythms.<br /><br />In other instances, songs sound somewhat hurried and perhaps unfinished: To its credit, the unexpected Brian Wilson-esque stacked vocal harmonies found at the start of \\"Blue Beard\\" represent an intriguing change up in contrast to the first several songs.  Likewise, the song's complex vocal arrangements on display are equally impressive.  However, the number comes too close to resembling Starland Vocal Band's \\"Afternoon Delight\\" before the song and its accompanying vocal fireworks are extinguished prematurely by a noticeably abrupt ending.<br /><br />Likewise, the up tempo numbers (e.g. \\"Laredo\\", \\"Northwest Apartment\\" also lack the pensive moods conveyed by even the fastest songs on Everything All The Time, featuring  guitar playing that is emotionally vacant, if musically competent.<br /><br />A final startling aspect to Infinite Arms involves the occasions where its songs and their production seem at moments to resemble the frequently lambasted latter day compositions of Weezer's Rivers Cuomo, power pop's fallen angel.  \\"Compliments\\" features the shuffled drum beat and similar chord progression found on Maladroit's \\"Keep Fishin'\\", while \\"Dilly\\" is marked by Cuomo's predilections for taut power chords, dulled pianos, and synths that don't so much wiggle as they make unsuccessful parasitic attempts to enter the body; similarly, \\"Evening Kitchen\\" relies heavily upon the treacled vocal harmonies favored by latter day Weezer.<br /><br />In closing, returning to my initial assessment, BoH is a band has lamentably devolved from quality, country-inflected indie rock in favor of milddle-of-the-road generica. BoH would be better served by returning to their previous approach of Everything All The Time, an album whose success rested in contemplative (borderline brooding/melancholic) numbers with considerably hazier song arrangements.fternoon Delight\\" before the song and its accompanying vocal fireworks are extinguished prematurely by a noticeably abrupt ending.

0393072231|5.0|I have been working in mortgage industry and saw whole drama unfold very closely but bought this book mainly for its entertainment value. Mr. Lewis is a gifted writer and having read Liar's Poker I thought this will be a good weekend read with book not being too big (only 260 pages). Well I am glad I did because it is extremely entertaining, the perspective is very fresh and very innovative, presenting the material from success stories of 3 odd investors not working for an investment bank is unique. There are many books written after this financial crisis everybody who had anything to do with it remotely came out with a book and hoped to cash in, some wrote Wallstreet gossip some wrote treatise into what failed the system but I am sure anyone who picks up this book is going to finish reading it and will be more informed and probably enraged at the culprits behind the crisis.    With financial reform being hashed out in congress it is a good crash course for any concerned citizen in the matter.

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I bought this knife and received the 2nd gen version. I also upgraded the grips to micarta scales for this to improve the grip. The new sheath that they send is lock tight. The knife will not fall out despite your best efforts.     I took it out into the woods for a 2 night camping trip with 5 buds. I used it to baton all of the wood, which was oak, for the entire trip. This knife never lost its edge or its desire to work! I was truly impressed. Every guy that saw it tried to baton with it and were impressed by the ease with which they able to do so.     Yes, the black finish rubs off as you drive this knife through piles of wood and cut dead trees down, but that is what makes it beautiful as it is now used and has purpose outside of the safe.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|This was bought for one of our family movie nights.  It was a great success.  Everyone including my wife and 8 year old son loved the movie.

B001LF347E|5.0|This needs to be prefaced with a warning.  If you cannot bear to see the Arthurian myth put in a blender on frappe, you will absolutely hate this.  Merlin and Arthur are the same age, Uther is still alive, Gwen is a black peasant girl, Morgana is Uther's ward and of no relation to Arthur at all, Mordred is a random Druid boy, and Lancelot is hispanic.  The costumes are anachronistic and the architecture is freaking Gothic.<br /><br />That said, as a show all by itself, I am absolutely in love with Merlin.  Every single actor clearly loves his or her own character.  The inter-character chemistry is amazing and real.  There is humour enough for everyone.  The fighting scenes are imperfect and mysteriously lacking in any blood ever, but still good fun to watch.<br /><br />So if you can put aside the original mythology and suspend disbelief, this is a fantastic series that I would recommend to anyone, and is appropriate for just about every age group.

1423113497|5.0|I read this series on the recommendation that it was Harry Potter-like and it almost ruined it for me. It is a GREAT series for kids who are into reading fantasy! but some adults (like myself at age 34) who are looking for the intricacy, descriptive scenes, drawn out battles and fleshed out characters of Rowling might be disappointed. Unlike most of the HP books, I would give this book to a 9 year old and be confident that he/she would be able to grasp the concepts easily. Book 1 started out as an HP knock-off and I ALMOST stopped reading. It is also a little slow and tough to get through but 2, 3 & 4 are excellent. You need to read book 1 because it sets the stage for the series and gives you lots of important information you need in later books. There are clearly some HP influences that I found a bit annoying but had I not been referred as a Potter fan then I think it would have gone unnoticed.    So aside from the unfair comparisons that should never be...its a great series! If you go in with no expectations other than reading a great fantasy series then that's what you'll get! There is humor, youthful romance, danger, mild violence that is not inappropriate for young readers (which I appreciate as a parent). Percy and his friends go on wild adventures that make for fast reading and a real page turner. The series gets progressively better and each book more detailed. Overall, it is a well written series and I can't wait to get book 5.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|This Avatar blu-ray does not play on Samsung BD-C6500 players even with their new updated firmware 1010.4 installed. Samsung is very slow in responding to Fox's new copy protection. I purchased this DVD along with the Samsung player and it did not play right out of the box. Give me a break all I won't to do is relax and watch a movie. I am very disapointed in blu-ray technology in general. Blu-ray has been out there for some years now and it still does not work 100%. I can not wait for the class action lawsuite to start. I will be joining in on this one because I am tired of software and firmware updates all the time on brand new products that I purchase. There needs to be a law against this.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|I think part of the problem with people criticizing The Pacific has already been alluded to by other reviewers.  The PTO was a far different war than what was taking place in the European Theater of Operations.  As awful as ANY war is, the PTO was, essentially, a race war.  The Japanese and Americans had preconceived stereotypes, much of it the result of government indoctrination (reference the boot camp recruit who tells Basilone that he \\"just wants to slap a Jap\\") that inflamed their mutual hatred.           Secondly, because the Japanese government had perverted the cultural code of Bushido, the Japanese soldiers felt it was:  preferable to die for their emperor rather than surrender; preferable to wire civilians (Okinawans) with explosives to kill Marines; preferable to use human shields; preferable to pretend to surrender or play possum in order to kill Marines.  This increased, by orders of magnitude, the sheer and utter hatred the Marines felt for their enemy.           Third, the conditions under which the Marines fought were so dreadful that many Marines were shattered by the overbearing combined weight of the combat, weather, exhaustion, tropical diseases, and terrain.  In Sledge's book, his description of the heat on Peleliu and the mud on Okinawa almost drove him to madness.  Leckie's book makes a similar point regarding the incessant rain on Cape Gloucester.           Thus, you do not see the same kind of comradeship among the Marines that we experienced in \\"Band of Brothers.\\"  A good friend of my father's served from Guadalcanal to Iwo Jima and he acknowledged that you could detest the guy in your foxhole . . . but you'd still lay down your life for him; the frustrations often caused Marines to take out their anxieties on one another; this was characterized in the near fight between Sledge and Snafu during the Okinawa campaign.  Yet, Snafu, though an utterly amoral character, looked out for Sledge's well-being when he advised Sledge not to take the gold teeth from a dead Japanese soldier.  And this was not unknown in the ETO either; recall, from BOB, the chewing out Perconte gives to the gung-ho new recruit as Perconte tries to read his book in piece.           I read one review on another site where an individual complained about the lack of \\"brotherhood\\" among the Marines and how they were always \\"whining.\\"  Sorry to inform this individual that griping is one of the key prerogatives of the enlisted fighting infantryman . . . and with good reason.  In \\"The Pacific,\\" you need look no further for the brotherhood among warriors when Sledge comforts his buddy, on Peleliu, who is convinced that if he takes part in the assault, he's going to get hit.  In the book, he does; he gets a \\"million dollar wound\\" and happily gets shipped back to a hospital ship.         But, personally, I need to look no further than my dad's old Marine friend who told me that \\"The producers got it as right as they could for civilian consumption.  That's just about what it was like . . . except that they don't make quite as bad as it really was.  There was a lot more Marines out Jap trophy hunting than they show, and a lot more summary executions of the few Jap prisoners than they show.  One buddy of mine was taking two Jap prisoners back to the CP when he passed a chow line that was forming.  He took 'em behind a bush, let 'em have it, and got in line.\\"  His approval of \\"The Pacific\\" was all I needed to know that my original gut reaction to it was spot on.  Kudos to the producers, cast, and crew.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|All the years Lucas had to come up with a good Indy Movie and this is the best he can do? Yet they made over 700,000,000.00 in box office from this.    I can say all the reasons to hate this movie but i know i'm limited in space for this review so i'll just go on record to say this was an insult to a great trilogy. It's best to end a series on a high note, not a low. The Last Crusade was the high note and this was the low.    I have a feeling Ford will want another movie made to help people forget this movie and end the series at a high note. Even Shia LeBuff hated this film as he was quoted recently. At least he agrees with us haters.
B002ZG98VO|4.0|This movie was pretty fantastic. I'll go ahead and get the Gladiator comparison out of the way though. Gladiator is one of my all time favorite films. I give it a 10 out of 10. This movie I give a solid 8 out of 10.<br /><br />To shrug this off as another \\"Robin Hood\\" movie would be oversight. This movie is not about Robin Hood but is instead about Robin Longstride and how this Robin Longstride becomes Robin Hood. It starts with Robin Longstride in one of the last battles of the crusades. After King Richard is killed, Robin Longstride and a few friends escape and assume the identity of some ambushed knights, one of which is Robert Loxley, to win passage home. Robin decides to fulfill Robert Loxley's dieing wish and returns his sword to his father who lives in Nottingham. Through all of this, Robin Longstride ends up getting pulled into defending Nottingham from a treasonous English Knight, Sir Godfrey, and eventually joins in the fight saving England from an invading France. The movie closes leaving Robin and Marion living in the Sherwood Forest and becoming Robin Hood.<br /><br />The acting was superb. Russel Crowe was flawless as always. Cate Blanchett as Marion, Max Von Sydow as Sir Walter, Mark Strong as Godfrey, Oscar Isaac as Prince John, and Kevin Durand as Little John all did an amazing job. There weren't any moments where the acting made you shudder and overall I thought the acting was just superb.<br /><br />The movie did drag on in the beginning parts but the writers/producers did a good job of mixing in action here and there to get you through the slow parts. The background of Robin Longstride was perhaps the weakest part of the movie. It was the classic \\"I'm an orphan and I hate my father because he abandoned me..oh wait He was a Hero and he was killed he didn't abandon me after all..I have a reason to live yay!!\\". Ridley Scott did it well, don't get me wrong, but that formula has become a little old these days IMO. However, the story keeps you interested and overall was put together very well.<br /><br />All in all this movie is definitely worth watching. For me (granted I am a huge Russel Crowe fan) this movie will be a day one purchase on Blu-Ray. I suggest everyone see this movie that likes Russel Crowe as an actor or enjoys a well thought out and put together action film.ed and overall was put together very well.<br /><br />All in all this movie is definitely worth watching.

006088732X|4.0|I had heard such great things about this book and it definitely didn't let me down. For some reason I was expecting the girls to be really big bitches but they weren't! Each of them had their far share of problems but being catty wasn't one of them.<br /><br />The mystery is there from the very first page and it's still there on the very last page. This book will leave you hanging on every word. There is no way you could read this slowly. You have to devour it to figure out what's going on and who'd behind all the messages. But none of those things are answered in the end!! Must read book two now!!!!<br /><br />I loved all the characters. Even though they had way more drama in their lives than was realistic they still felt very real to me. I was definitely cheering them on the whole time, even if the things they were doing wasn't \\"right\\".  I can't wait to find out if I will still be cheering for them in later books.<br /><br />Overall, this was a very fast read and I liked it a lot. I would recommend it. And of course I can't not mention the show! After I finished the book I watched the trailer and I must say I'm pretty excited about it. The show premieres June 8th on ABC Family. (ABC Family will definitely have to tone it down a little huh?)
0385523904|5.0|Wow, what a great book.  I was nearly moved to tears at one point.  This would be a great choice for people with little or no knowledge of North Korea as well as anyone with some background.  I couldn't put this one down.  Surprisingly up-to-date.  Most of all, the author really put the situation in a personal context through the stories of defectors and the people left behind.  I'd highly recommended this book to anyone.
B002ONC9NC|5.0|I feel that I could watch this movie everyday. It is, as my title says, Amazing. Carey Mulligan nails the role of Jenny, making the relationship between Jenny and David flawless. It could have come across as creepy, but both actors portrayed their roles so well, that it was nothing short of wonderful. Young Jenny is in dire need of change in her life, and David presents her with the excitement she needs. Rosamund Pike plays a role completely opposite of her normal roles, and does a fantastic job, and Emma Thompson is, as always, brilliant. The story is so well written, the script is excellent, the characters are memorable and easy to relate to. Overall, I suggest this movie to anyone who loves the excitement of something new.

I didn't like rita in the first season but when the second season came out i started to like her alot more. I can't believe that they killed her off. One of my favorite things about this show is that it doesn't involve alot of cheesy stuff and babies. I do not like to watch shows that have alot of baby interations. And now that rita is gone it's gonna be all about Harry 2. I gave it 5 stars because no matter how crappy the other characters are or the ending i am hooked for life. If you loved the other season's of dexter and are a dedicated fan, watch it!

0307592839|5.0|Seventy-seven pages into Visit, there is an exchange that is emblematic of what goes on in this firecracker of a novel.  Scotty, the super-talented guitar player from Bennie's seventies garage band, shows up in Benny's office. Now it's the nineties. Bennie is riding the crest of a wave as a recording impresario. Scotty is worn out, an obvious loser. He smiles, and shows the gaps in his teeth. What he's there for? Bennie asks him. They've been out of touch for twenty years. Scotty says: \\"I want to know what happened between A and B.\\" That could be the motto for this exceptional novel: it's about expectations unachieved and memories of pasts more glorious, or at least more promising than what the players in this novel have had to settle for today.<br /><br />Sasha, a former flower child but thirty years later married (late), attending classes in college (very late), and with a doctor husband who's kind but always busy and two children, one slightly autistic, remembers \\"when she was like anyone, with a life that worried and electrified and overwhelmed her.\\" She laments what she's lost over her life so far: \\"I get to know a lot of people. But it never really lasts.\\"  Another character mourns, \\"I feel like everything is ending.\\"<br /><br />Brilliantly written and plotted, Visit traces the careers of a motley group of young seventies adventurers as they move into middle age (which they find neither as exciting or compelling). The book shifts from one group of characters to another and from time to time without obvious signposts. Egan frequently elides time in the space of a single paragraph: you know not only what happens at the time to the character but what will happen thirty years later. The effect is mildly disorienting but creates moments in which the reader feels, and juxtaposes, emotions felt in two very different parts of the same person's life. The story is told sometimes in the third person, sometimes the first; one stunning chapter is presented wholly in Power Point slides. (Sasha's thirteen-year-old son keeps his journal in Power Point.)<br /><br />This is the first novel by Jennifer Egan that I have read but it will not be the last. She knows her craft and writes exceptionally well. After the first chapters, it's hard to put the book down: you care for the characters. Everything works in this imaginative work of empathy.(Sasha's thirteen-year-old son keeps his journal in Power Point.)

B000AOEMXM|1.0|First off, I am a HUGE Star Trek fan and always have been. This series was a Joke! The writers knew about Star Trek as much as Dr McCoy knew about klingon anatomy.<br />First off...Archer.....where did they get Archer? Star Trek the Animated in 1973 in a episode said April was the very first Enterprise capt. I mean WTF!!!!!!!  How can you totaly, completely ignore a existing story and history line?<br />Then, the episode where they came up with the \\"non interference\\" was a joke! You had a race dying from a disease and they withheld the medicine saying nature outta just take its cource and we shouldnt interfere, laughable. So Kirk never should have gotten the Ritallen in the episode \\"Requruim for Methesula\\" or they should just have let the klingons die out when paxis blew up. Whatever. The show was a mess. The only thing good about this series was the final 3 episodes where they were in a Alternate Universe, had they satrted with that, it wouda been a classic, instead it's just rubbish.<br />This show could have been so great but I really think the writing and just the look and feel and show stunk. The writing was so lame that they had to make a continuing boring story line of the Zindi.<br />Fans hated the show and thus was cancelled 4 years early than projected.<br />Oh well.
0307454541|2.0|I'm not devoting much to this other than to say that if you're looking for easy, one-dimensional characters and the author's thinly veiled ego parading around as the protagonist (start counting how many women he sleeps with early) and on top of it all, a very clunky translation, you're in for a treat. To the rest of you, keep searching for intelligent thrillers because this is not it.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I used to own the Sennheiser 595 headphones which was supposed to be fantastic headphones.  They are very good, unfortunately after stepping on them and breaking them I replaced them and chose to go with the Sony MDR-7506 headphones, the difference is worlds apart.  I sold high end stereo systems for several years and have an ear for hearing quality Cans (headphones) and the Sony are less than half the price of the Sennheisers with in my opinion twice the sound quality.  Well worth it.
0061537969|5.0|We read this book in our bookclub (ages range from 20's to 50's)and everyone enjoyed this book.  It's amazing how much more you consider an observation, or opinion made by a dog than that of a human. Definitely worth picking up.
B00383YC2S|5.0|There's just something unique about Alizée, a certain je ne sais quoi that endears her to all who come within her orbit. In the early aughts, she rapidly rose from obscurity to fame shortly after her debut, producing the number one European hit in 2000 and, for at least one year, becoming the best-selling chanteuse française worldwide.    Now, she has broken her creative silence for the first time in something over three years with her newest CD, \\"Une Enfant Du Siecle\\". The style is totally different but the voice is unmistakably Alizée and a more mature Alizée at that. Described by some as French electro-pop, I was prepared for the CD's contents to be reminiscent of Yelle's recent performances but it's less extreme than Yelle's. It is, in a word, delightful.    The sixty-four euro question has been answered: can Alizée continue to be a musical tour de force sans the influence of her former mentor, Mylène Farmer? The answer, clearly, is yes she can!    My only regret? That there wasn't more than slightly under thirty-seven minutes of music on the disc. Ah, but that leaves something more, one can hope, for the next time...
0307473708|3.0|Having first heard of this series by watching (and loving!) the show and being a huge crime/thriller novel reader, I thought I had found the perfect new series of books to dive headfirst into. However,I was sadly mistaken. This is one of the few times that the \\"movie\\" version was better than the book itself. Although Lindsay deserves merit in the idea of Dexter, SHOtime writers should be the ones getting the praise!
B002QW7ALM|5.0|It was ironic that I had a conversation with my father about the abysmal state the movie industry is in right now (very few original and fresh ideas) right before I saw this movie.  Almost every big-budget blockbuster has highly predictable plots and requires that the intelligent viewer ignore that inner-critic and go with the emotional ride.  That is NOT the case with Pandorum.    The movie starts off with some exposition, but ultimately presents the viewers with just a 'situation'.  Two men wake up from hyper-sleep in a future ship designed to save the human race by colonizing a new planet.  That's it. The beauty of this plot is that the real horror of the situation comes from its unknown elements.  Right from the beginning the emotional connection is made with the main, Bower, as he tries to do the impossible and salvage the situation with little to no information.  Pieces of the puzzle do slowly come, but not before the audience has been completely immersed in the emotional horror that the two men face.    From this epic beginning the scenery gets more complex with sci-fi environments that speak of true creativity (more personal favorite being the auxiliary power devices).  The entire ship feels like another world as we see its inhabitants move around like they are on land.  Everything, from the lack of lighting to the color contrasts, adds to the sense of insanity that the characters must face.    One element in particular I liked was the sense of realism that the characters portrayed.  The special effects were there obviously, but didn't actually effect the human characters, in that they didn't have super-human speed or lightening quick reflexes.  In fact when they fell down they actually staggered in getting back up (although some of their collisions with the machinery should have killed them, but that's par for the course with any movie).  In fact there's a great scene where our main, Bower, suffers a bought of claustrophobia, showing a common human weakness.      Overall I really like the movie.  It had me guessing til the very end with an ending that didn't feel contrived or forced.  I do warn there are some squeal moments of gore, but they aren't there for gore's sake (not like Hostel or Saw).  This movie's different, it doesn't present everything in the beginning and it doesn't treat the audience like they're stupid (the explains come fast and are not mulled over).  If you're up for the challenge I say give it a try.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|Glad I picked this up. Feeling every track. Thought I'd leave a comment to support.
B0037AGASG|1.0|The first step to accepting Justin Bieber is getting past his age. It's everywhere on this record, impossible to ignore, and, frankly, if Bieber was simply a twenty-something white boy with an R&B fetish, My World 2.0 would be easy to acknowledge as a disposable adult contemporary record in the vein of latter-day Backstreet Boys.
B0013N3DSE|5.0|Yes folks, as you know, this film is in 4:3. You wouldn't think that an acknowledged classic would look at good on Blu as this does but even the \\"restored\\" version does not have the luster that the BD has. The color values are simply outstanding and does justice to the expense of Technicolor in 1937-1938. Yes, this is the romanticized version of the hooded bandit of Sherwood and the Middle Ages portrayed here aren't dirty, harsh, and vicious as they really were. Just accept that this movie is FUN, filled with detail, and even for the two \\"hands\\" (two different Directors) it is as good a romantic tale as is the legend. Considering that the BD version is downright cheap and it's a quality print, even if you have the restored version, indulge yourself and see this in all the glory I can imagine those in 1938 saw.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|The ArchAndroid is the long awaited debut album follow-up to singer-songwriter Janelle Monáe`s 2007 debut EP, Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase.  And it was worth the wait.   The music is more complex, the production is fuller, the theatrics even bigger.  In short, it is one hell of a debut album.    Janelle Monáe has come up with a robotic alter ego named Cyndi Mayweather, and the Metropolis Suites are her story through an oppressive world in which she discovers she is a Messiah-like figure in hopes to free her people. Her EP first introduced the character with Suite I and her plight, and ArchAndroid is the more personal continuation with Suites II and III.  I just hope we won't have to wait three more years for Suite IV.    To say that ArchAndroid is a good achievement as a debut album is a huge understatement as it is an amazing achievement. Written on paper, this CD shouldn't work, as it just sounds way too ambitious.  From the conceptual plot to the multitude of genres (psychobilly, glam, hip-hop, jazz, funk, afro-beat, and film music to name a few) to the numerous big named guest artists, it feels like a mess and just too big for one person, but if her EP proved anything it proved one thing, she IS that ambitious and has the guts to attempt it.  And she doesn't just succeed, she excels.    The album opens up with a sweeping, energetic orchestral overture then immediately moves on to the next three songs played without break.  And with only the first 4 songs (and just as many genres), you know you are in for a ride like no other.  The ArchAndroid just grips you and never eases up giving you time to breath, it just keeps moving forward.  With songs like Come Alive, Tightrope, and Cold War, Suite II is very in your face compared to Suite III. Suite III starts with another overture then it mellows out with a quick burst of energy on Make The Bus featuring Of Montreal (arguably the weakest track on the album) and ends a couple of songs later with the 9 minute multi-sectioned song BaBopByeYa, one of the best songs on the album.  And with all the sonic imagery Monáe puts into the album, it is easy to imagine just what is going on (Broadway, anyone?).    And a quick word about Janelle Monáe: she is one incredibly talented woman.  Concept albums aren't new, but the breadth to which she reaches is amazing (almost 70 minutes of music), and to pull it off is mind-boggling.  Also, the amount of different genres she is able to take on and make sound effortless is staggering.  Her voice is definitely the highlight of the album, its almost magical in how she can manipulate it to get it to do whatever she wants. I expect great things from Monáe in the coming years, and if this album is any indication of what's to come, I can't wait.    The ArchAndroid isn't just one of the best Pop albums released in awhile, it is one of the best albums released in quite some time. With the combination of Janelle Monáe's vocal prowess and the amazing music and production, you will be hard pressed to find a better pop album debut.

0786868724|5.0|This true story is about a request made by Mitch Albom's childhood rabbi, Albert Lewis, to deliever his eulogy at his funeral. Mitch has decieded to spend time with his former rabbi to get to know him better in preparing for the eulogy. Mitch and the Reb begin to discuss life, hope, family, health and death to get past the image of him being just a Man of God, which is the image of the Reb Mitch has had in his mind since his childhood. Mitch expects his vistits to be only a few weeks maybe a month, but him and the Reb end up meeting over to course of eight years.     Albert Lewis always wanted faiths to unite, and in trying to do that he walks arm in arm with another religions minister to show the younger students that different faiths can get along. Then Mitch tries to help a rundown church in Detroit called I Am My Brother's Keeper, run by Henry Covington. Mitch discusses Henry's past of drug dealing and his experiences in jail, and why he suddenly changed and became a man of God. Now Henry's church is a refuge for homeless people, where they feed them and give them a place to sleep because he feels the need to do the best he can.    Have A Little Faith is a really good book in my opinion, if you enjoyed Mitch Alboms book Tuesdays With Morrie, then you will deffinately like this book. All Mitches books have the same style and if you enjoy his books then you will love this one too. I would recomend this book for both young adults and adults. Not only will young adults love this book but so will adults, because it has stuff that everyone can relate too, but younger audiences might have trouble understanding the concepts.
B003L0V758|5.0|This album is an amazing achievement. It draws from so many styles of music while combining them into a unique concept album that can give everyone hope in music. Janelle Monae is an incredible hyper creative and talented artist who will go very very far.

Any person who loves a book that has a cross between science fiction and a feeling of hope will love this book, Skellig, by David Almond.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|Following an album like 1971's magnificent \\"Sticky Fingers\\" was always going to be a tall order, but The Stones did it with swagger and panache. \\"Exile On Main St\\" was released 12 May 1972 as a 2LP set on Rolling Stones Records COC 69100 in the UK and on COC 2-2900 in the USA. It reached the coveted number 1 spot on both sides of the pond - and like The Beatles \\"White Album\\" before it - is a flawed and sprawling thing, but considered by most to be a masterpiece nonetheless.<br /><br />This 17 May 2010 reissue (18 May in the USA) is the 2CD expanded version of that double on Rolling Stones/Polydor 273 429-5. Disc 1 has the full compliment of 18 tracks at 67:18 minutes, while Disc 2 is a new 10-track mixture of previously unreleased outtakes and alternate versions at 41:12 minutes. All songs are by Mick Jagger and Keith Richards except \\"Ventilator Blues\\" which is co-written with Mick Taylor, while \\"Shake Your Hips\\" and \\"Stop Breaking Down\\" are Slim Harpo and Robert Johnson cover versions. As with \\"Sticky Fingers\\", the additional musicians and producer (Jimmy Miller) added hugely to the power of almost every song and should be noted for it - Bobby Keys on Saxophone, Jim Price on Trumpet, Nicky Hopkins, Ian Stewart and Billy Preston on Piano and Organ with lady-soul veterans Clydie King and Vanetta Fields on Backing Vocals. Dr. John also sang backup on \\"Let It Loose\\".<br /><br />SOUND:<br />As with the 2009 reissues STEPHEN MARCUSSEN (over 1000 mastering credits to his name including the \\"Alfie\\" soundtrack with Mick Jagger) and STEWART WHITMORE of Marcussen Mastering have remastered the original tapes and the sound is glorious throughout. \\"Loving Cup\\" followed by \\"Happy\\" are beautifully clear and \\"Tumbling Dice\\" is at last full and in your face. Most every track is improved - the instrumentation in your speakers with a fabulous live and shambolic feel. The acoustic and harmonica opening of \\"Sweet Virginia\\" and the drums of \\"All Down The Line\\" are superb. To me it's a huge improvement, a balls-to-the-wall triumph. Downsides - the hiss level on \\"Shine A Light\\" that was there in the first place is now more accented as it is on the frantic \\"Rip This Joint\\". Some despised the 2009 remasters, so this will be more of the same for them, but most I suspect will absolutely love it. Wish I could say the same about the presentation...<br /><br />PACKAGING:<br />Very poor I'm afraid. The front flap and rear of the original 2LP cover are produced on the outside of the digipak (as they should be) with the inner LP photo spread reproduced on the inside of the digipak, BUT the original vinyl double also had two fantastic inner sleeves and a set of fold-out postcards (only came with 1st pressings and they're now very rare). Only 1 of the 4 sides of the two inner sleeves is reproduced! That the idiots would not bother picturing the 'postcards' seems to be par for the course for Stones reissues these days, but that great shot of Mick & Keith at the mike with whiskey bottle in hand is missing - as is the \\"I Don't Want To Talk About Jesus I Just Want To See His face\\" quote on the other side - unbelievable! The supposedly exclusive 12-page booklet is different to all other issues, but turns out to be just black and white photos of the session and no liner notes whatsoever - none! The track-by-track details are now only bland black and white printed listings, which lose all of the inner sleeves magical artwork. It's an insult that this supposedly 'deluxe' reissue cavalierly misses out on crucial visual elements of the original release - it's hugely unimaginative and workmanlike at best.<br /><br />BONUS DISC:<br />Although the 10 bonus tracks have the same original backing band - and despite what the track-by-track credits 'don't' tell you - it's obvious that the first 5 have had 'treatment' of some kind - vocal tracks added on/redone recently.<br /><br />\\"Pass The Wine (Sophia Loren)\\" is an ok opener, but the track that sounds most like a genuine outtake peach is \\"Plundered My Soul\\" which is fantastic (it was issued in April 2010 as a limited edition Record Shop Day 7\\" single in the USA and UK). Best approximation is that it sounds like the B-side \\"Tumbling Dice\\" should always have had (lyrics above). \\"I'm Not Signifying\\" is ok, but hardly great, but there then follows a genuinely lovely ballad \\"Following The River\\" complete with the new girls giving it some soulful backing vocals (Lisa Fischer and Cindy Mizelle). It's far better than you think. \\"Dancing In The Light\\" is a jaunty mid-tempo song similar to \\"Hide Your Love\\" off \\"Goat's Head Soup\\". The opening of \\"So Divine (Aladdin Story) is closer to Brian Jones Rolling Stones circa \\"Dandelion\\" and its really interesting - Jim Price on vibes and Bobby Keys on some kind-of treated saxophone sound. There follows two \\"Alternate Takes\\" of \\"Loving Cup\\" and \\"Soul Survivor\\". Now these are far closer to what we want - \\"Loving Cup\\" opens with a lovely Nicky Hopkins piano refrain and suddenly it's \\"there\\" - that shambolic feel to everything - especially the guitars of Richards and Taylor duelling to the end yet complimenting each other so perfectly. Now this I will love.  And then another gem - Keith carrying the vocals and sloppy stuff on \\"Soul Survivor\\" instead of Mick - and it works - and when that riffing guitar kicks in, I'm balling my eyes out and there's chills on my arms. \\"Good Time Women\\" is a forerunner for \\"Tumbling Dice\\" and is fab - rough and tumble as well. \\"Title 5\\" opens with studio chatter of \\"Take 1\\" and is a strange little rocking instrumental which kind of peters out, interesting but that's all...<br /><br />Ok - so there's no live stuff and there should be (legendarily good), the \\"All Down The Line\\" Alternate Take that's on the B-side of the \\"Plundering My Soul\\" 7\\" single isn't on here either, which is just stupid - and the 4-track Excerpts 7\\" Flexi single from the April 1972 NME in the UK with song edits and an exclusive \\"Exile On Main Street Blues\\" track is nowhere to be seen let alone pictured either. But overall - I'm kind of shocked at how good Disc 2 is. I'll ignore some of these newer makeovers for sure, but those Alternate Takes are thrilling.<br /><br />In May 2012, \\"Exile\\" will be 40 years old and Mick and Keef will be more Zimmer Frames than Glimmer Twins. But that won't stop this coolest of double-albums from being the absolute business. I suspect the real truth about this 2CD reissue is far simpler - men around the world will see this digital temptress pouting on the shelf of their local megastore, feel a quickening of the pulse and a movement in their trouser area - and be unable to resist.<br /><br />And you know, you can't help but feel that these two canny English lads already know this.<br /><br />God bless The Rolling Stones and roll on \\"Some Girls...<br />(due later this year apparently)<br /><br />PS:<br />HMV in the UK have issued \\"Exile\\" with the digipak inside an exclusive card slipcase (Polydor 274 102-3). I've pictured both sides of it for fans.<br /><br />The Japanese, however, have not surprisingly got the most desirable version of them all; it's inside a 14-disc box set called \\"From The 70's To 00's\\" which contains all their albums from \\"Sticky Fingers\\" through to \\"A Bigger Bang\\". They are all on the SHM-CD format (Super High Materials) and each has the original album artwork repro'd on one of those 5\\" Mini LP sleeves we so love (UICY-91558). \\"Exile\\" is included - being the 2010 Remaster version - and is in a gatefold card sleeve complete with its original fold-out postcards and two inner sleeves.e peach is \\"Plundered My Soul\\" which is fantastic (it was issued in April 2010 as a limited edition Record Shop Day 7\\" single in the USA and UK).

B001DF68MA|5.0|We bought this seat for our 1 year old son to ride in during our family bike rides. We love it and so does he! It's so great to have him in front of me. The seat did not affect my balance at all, my bike doesn't feel heavier and it only took a few minutes to get used to holding my knees out a bit wider to accommodate the seat (and I'm only 5'2\\"). It's amazing to be able to lean down and talk to my son and point out things that we see. He actually fell asleep at the end of our first bike ride in it and I gently laid his head on the front pad and he was fine until we got home. We love this seat and we are so happy we found it!
B003KTEGG2|5.0|Band of Horses, a band that came along at exactly the right time in the Indie scene, and helped define the sound of the decade. They were mountain men, with beards, but that didn't stop them from making surprisingly melodic & sweet indie music. Don't believe me? Check out \\"Nobody's Going To Love You\\" from their 2nd album. Call me crazy, but that might just be the best love song of the decade. So, after 16 months of working on their follow-up effort, does this horse win the Triple Crown, or does it fall behind causing complete financial collapse to its investors?<br /><br />Highlights Include:<br />Factory<br />Compliments<br />Dilly<br />Neighbor<br /><br />Soundwise, the Band of Horses sounds like they've stepped into world of shoe-gazing pop more than ever before. In fact, the album as a whole doesn't sound like it was crafted by a bunch of bearded mountain men, it sounds like it came out of Chicago indie scene or even the sunny coast of California. But at the same time, it still sounds like a logical step for the band. It's just not a rough around the edges as before. It's shined up with great production values. If you were a fan of the band previously, or you're a production purist, you may be highly turned off by this sound. But if you let it sit with you for a while, let you buy it a drink and really set in, then I feel you may enjoy the album much more, and take it for the great piece of work it is.<br /><br />Overall, while it'll be polarizing for fans, I come out on the side that it's a nice musical step for the band, and it just sounds great as a whole. In fact, the only problem I have with this album is that it doesn't have any classic tracks as 'Cease To Begin' had. But still, this album might be the best overall work they've produced yet. Don't hold me to that, as the album really has to sit on you, but so far, it gets better everytime. And that's great for any band.
0307271862|2.0|The book starts as crime fiction with one of the most intriguing, violent, and emotional crime scenes I've ever read - someplace in the cold, gloomy forests of a January Sweden. It quickly shifts to a micro-history of the construction of the first US transcontinental rail system with a special focus on the forced labor of Chinese immigrants, then to a current days economics/political lecture concerning the future of China, then to a travelogue of sorts through Zimbabwe and Mozambique (still with me ?) where the critical issue seems to be plotting for mass migrations (of Chinese again). And, silly me, I thought this was supposed to be crime fiction.  Now where at this point is our heroine, the Swedish judge?  Well, I'm not exactly sure, it's been quite a while since we heard from her.  Well, I do note that the author spends about 6 months a year in Mozambique so I guess it's a very important subject for him.  Maybe not to me, but to him and afterall, it is his book.  Or is it my book?
0441013597|4.0|I read this book twenty years ago and bought it again to try to remember if I had liked it or not.  I may not have appreciated it then, but I really enjoyed it this time.  The story is an epic one, set on an intricately-designed desert planet with a variety of cultures and individuals scheming for political power.  At the heart is a tale of a reluctant messianic figure who experiences tragedy and tries to find a way to rise again that will not cause his followers to doom the universe.  Herbert plays up the epic nature well, by starting each new section with a quote from some fictional chronicle of these events.  The effect does take out all tension of whether or not Paul (the messianic figure) will live or die, but the benefit of knowing that these events are Historical and Significant far outweighs the lack of tension.      I imagine that the frequent references to jihad will offend many modern readers, as will the mingling of quotations from the Torah and the Koran without any reference to a supernatural God (in fact, I have been surprised to see this book described as a religious work, since there are numerous ceremonies and scriptures but no real concept of a supernatural force of any kind, and the salvation that Paul is expected to bring is an ecological and philosophical one).  I also think the ecological significance of this book has changed a bit since its 1965 publication (I don't know that many environmentalists today are looking to convert deserts into rainforests, although the end of the book does point to a certain restraint and respect for systems that soften the thrust a bit).      For me, though, the best part of the book is the way that some of the characters are gifted at translating conversations and reading body language.  There is a particularly good scene at a dinner party when no one really means what he says, and the more astute characters observe and tell the reader what each exchange really means.  It changed the way I listened to group conversations for a while, honestly, and made me think a lot about the layers of meaning I hide in my own speech.  I have no plans to finish this series, as I'm quite satisfied with the state of things as Herbert left them at the end of this book, but I recommend this to anyone interested in science fiction and fantasy, especially those looking for something to compare favorably with the Lord of the Rings and Wheel of Time classics.
B0030BYWKK|4.0|Midlake released their second album, 2006's \\"The Trials of Van Occupanther\\", to tremendous critical acclaim (but alas not so much commercial success), and after endless touring and time away, now finally comes the highly anticipated new album. The question on everybody's mind is whether the band could equal or surpass \\"Van Occupanther\\".<br /><br />\\"The Courage of Others\\" (11 tracks; 42 min.) starts off with an absolutely mesmorizing \\"Acts of Men\\", followed by an equally enthralling \\"Winter Dies\\", with a surprisingly strong electric guitar throughout the song. \\"Small Mountain\\" continues in the same mid-tempo, with flutes preminent. The comparison to early Jethro Tull and even Genesis (if you open your mind) are not far-fletched (check out the title track!). \\"Fortune\\", \\"Rulers, Ruling Are Things\\" and \\"Bring Down\\" are gorgeous acoustic-themed songs. \\"The Horn\\", towards the end of the album, is the heaviest-sounding, rocking almost, track. In truth, there are no weak tracks on here, I've been playing this album countless times since getting it a few months ago.<br /><br />In all, this is for me a more than satisfying follow-up to the \\"Van Occupanther\\" album. Is it as good? Maybe not, but that shouldn't deter anyone, Midlake die-hards or newcomers alike, to check this out. I happen to catch these guys in concert here in Cincinnati this past weekend, and they put on a fantastic set, heavy of course on the \\"Courage\\" album, but also bringing plenty of nuggets of the \\"Van Occupanther\\" album as well. What a great show that was, and if you have a chance to see them on tour, do not miss them! Meanwhile, \\"The Courage of Others\\" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!
B002ONC9NC|4.0|In the pre-Beatles dawn of 1961, Jenny Mellor is an utterly precocious 16-year-old schoolgirl who peppers her conversations with existential references and French malapropos as she aspires to be a worldly sophisticate living the high life in Paris. The reality is that she lives with her middle-class parents in the London suburb of Twickenham as she studies Latin and prepares for admission to Oxford, her parents' lifelong dream. The chasm between reality and fantasy suddenly seems to disappear with the unexpected arrival of David Goldman, a thirty-something charmer who sweeps her off her feet. The relationship starts out innocently enough and then becomes a head-spinning swirl of concerts, jazz clubs, art auctions and eventually a fateful trip to Paris.<br /><br />Directed by Danish filmmaker Lone Scherfig, the film is reminiscent of 1960's-era youth-oriented films like Tony Richardson's [[ASIN:B00006JY3I A Taste of Honey]] and James Clavell's [[ASIN:B00003L9C1 To Sir, With Love]] in serving as a cautionary, coming-of-age tale, but the screenplay by Nick Hornby (adapted from Lynn Barber's memoir) never panders to the more tawdry dimensions of the older man/younger girl affair. In fact, what I appreciate most about this affectionate, low-key film is that Scherfig and Hornby maintain a nonjudgmental attitude toward the characters, including David, his smarmy \\"business partner\\" Danny, and Danny's vacuously fashionable girlfriend Helen. Instead, we are guided on one young woman's entry into the adult world of love from blind infatuation to crashing heartbreak.<br /><br />Even as she faces unexpected truths about David, Jenny recognizes that her desires are real, even if they are shallow or misguided. She can't help but act upon them, even dropping out of her A-levels for Oxford, and in turn, when things become complicated, Jenny knows she is accountable for her own actions as she is forced to reconcile them with her evolving self-revelations. As Jenny, Carey Mulligan turns in a beguiling performance that has critics reaching for apt comparisons with the likes of Audrey Hepburn, Jean Seberg, and Audrey Tautou. The gamine quality is certainly there, but Mulligan's fierce intelligence and watchful demeanor are what really ground the film. Moreover, what makes Peter Sarsgaard's performance as the elliptical David particularly effective is that he makes what should have been a morally reprehensible character into someone with a genuine, almost naive regard for Jenny.<br /><br />Because the actors make the relationship real rather than a fantasy version, the love scenes between Mulligan (actually 22 when this was filmed) and Sarsgaard are sweet with none of the predatory tension that would have inescapably darkened the film's tone. The chameleonic Alfred Molina is terrifically engaging as Jenny's class-conscious father, while Dominic Cooper ([[ASIN:B001GKJ2DY Mamma Mia! The Movie]]) and especially Rosamund Pike ([[ASIN:B00005JLBE Die Another Day]]) sharply play Danny and Helen as hedonistic social dandies constantly on the prowl for a good time. Cinematographer John de Borman makes Paris a beautiful, inviting playground for the lovers and suburban London a fitting social contrast. The 2010 DVD contains some bare-bones extras - a few deleted scenes, a promotional featurette titled \\"Walking the Red Carpet\\", and an insightful commentary track with Scherfig, Mulligan, and Sarsgaard.g performance that has critics reaching for apt comparisons with the likes of Audrey Hepburn, Jean Seberg, and Audrey Tautou.

0312370849|1.0|This was required reading for my book club, and what a disappointment. Although the story sounded intriguing, the author clearly needed to do a better job of developing plots and characters. The characters conveniently show up at the right place at the right time, with no realistic rhyme or reason. We are supposed to believe that William or Julia on a writer's salary just fly on a whim across the Atlantic? That William of course had to have his mother's French diary translated by an American of all people when he was living in Europe; like he couldn't have found someone in Europe to translate it? That Julia's in-laws just happened to have lived in the same apartment where Sarah had lived? The characters themselves are so predictable that it leaves no suspense whatsoever. You just knew that Julia was going to get a divorce, have a baby, stay in touch with William, and knew what the baby's name was going to be. There are some really great books written with the Holocaust theme; this clearly is not one of them.
0061914177|4.0|I didn't like this book to start off with.  I thought the author was a conceited idiot and wanted to stop reading.  But stubbornness prevailed and I stuck with it, and I'm glad I did.  Starting at chapter six, I started to get the point and found myself taking notes and getting ideas.  Now that I'm done with the book, I can say that I'm glad I read it.  Good ideas plus conciseness (about 140 pages) are always pluses for me.  One disclaimer: I haven't read many books on social media and biz dev opportunities, so I'm not sure if his ideas are truly unique or just unique to me.

0743297334|4.0|For the first fifty pages or so, my thought about this book was, \\"I think I liked it better when it was set in New York, and it was The Great Gatsby.\\"  This novel has a great deal in common with that one, with a cast of relatively bored and wealthy characters slouching from drink to drink as they try to extend their parties into infinity.  There is not a sense of right or wrong, except on a party foul level when one character will occasionally feel slighted (rightfully or not) by another.  The prose is artistic but direct, with occasional poetic musings about scenery or bullfighting.  And when it comes to the similarities, I think Fitzgerald achieved much more than Hemingway.    Ultimately, though, I appreciate this book for what it is.  No, it's not as good as Gatsby.  It doesn't have much of a plot, as the characters just float from party to party in Spain and France, and there is a shocking amount of unapologetic anti-Semitism.  Still, there is a lot to like in the book.  The dialogue is terrific, the kind of drunken conversations that you wish your drunken friends would have, and Lady Brett Ashley has a tragic and compelling arc.  And while I don't share Hemingway's love for bullfighting, his passion itself is endearing, and I underlined a passage about the nature of greatness that has application outside of the bullfighting context.  This book is worth reading, even if it isn't quite a masterpiece.
B003CIG7AE|4.0|Band of Horses seemingly came out of nowhere in 2006 with their accomplished debut album \\"Everything All the Time\\", immediately establishing themselves at the forefront of Seattle's indie-folk-rock (Fleet Foxes would be shortly following in their footsteps). The sophomore album \\"Cease to Begin\\" followed in 2007, and since then the band has done a huge amount of touring. Now finally comes the eagerly awaited third album.<br /><br />\\"Infinite Arms\\" (12 tracks; 45 min.) starts off with perhaps the best track, an immediately classic-sounding \\"Factory\\" (reminding me of \\"The Great Salt Lake\\" from their first album. \\"Compliments\\" and the harder charging \\"Laredo\\" follow nicely. After that, the sound becomes more introvert on songs like \\"Blue Board\\" and the title track. What a fantastic first half of the album, which I rate 4.5 stars. The second half of the album kicks off with the Beach Boys-sounding \\"Dilly\\". However, after that, the band goes quieter again, and remains like this from pretty much the rest of the album. \\"Older\\" is too country-sounding for me. \\"For Anabelle\\" is a beautiful balled. \\"NW Dept.\\" thankfully finds the band going all -out, before 6+ min. \\"Neighbors\\" brings the album to a close. I rate the second half of the album 3.5 stars.<br /><br />\\"Infinite Arms\\" is a solid album, no more, no less. It doesn't have the same element of surprise either of the first two albums had. But there are enough great songs on here that I will continue to seek out Band of Horses. I've seen them in concert a number of times over the years (including once here in Cincinnati in a super-small venue before the debut album truly took off). If you have a chance to see them live, don't miss them, they always put on a great show.
B0030LLAFU|1.0|Note that this was not an original copy of the Goemon DVD release!  My dvd was a knock-off, the cover was well made but still noticably tampered and blurry.  The movie itself worked fine exept for 5-10 seconds missing in the end scene.  The english (have not checked the spanish one) subtitle was bad and sometimes missing comepletely and the timing was often very misplaced and quick.    When I pay full price for a new dvd release that claims to be an original I expect the real deal, for a fake it was ok but not worth what I payed for it!    Very dissapointing copy.    The actual movie itself was great though, strongly recommend it if you can get an original copy though..

0966638328|3.0|I was very excited from reading the great reviews, but was disappointed when I opened the book. The book itself is way bigger than it needs to be. It is filled with splashy pages of photographs, gradients, calligraphic font with too much line spacing, large words kind of splattered here and there. I wish the information was more condensed and clearly written but the way it was presented seemed like a scrapbook journal. And as one reviewer pointed out, it's like a children's book. The glossy paper also feels cheap in my hands. Would rather much see the color combinations on a matt paper instead of having the distracting gloss. The color combinations are interesting and vibrant, but I can only assume they will produce something that looks like it's from the early 90s  after looking at the examples and the over all design of the book.

0425200450|2.0|To her credit, Agatha Christie surprised me with the solution to this locked room murder mystery, but in my defense, that's because the solution was entirely nonsensical.      Without getting into any spoilers, this mystery novel has its good points.  There is a certain 1930s charm to it, especially with a \\"ripped from the headlines\\" subplot about a thinly disguised Lindbergh Baby story, and an assumption that every woman on the train wears a \\"dressing gown\\" to bed, and an assumed knowledge of how servants are expected to behave in the estate of a wealthy family.  There is some (unintentional?) humor as characters pat themselves on the back for how socioeconomically diverse the train's passenger list is.. before they (And Christie as narrator) proceed to show condescending contempt for the second-class passengers and Italians.  And Christie's portrayal of Americans is great (for example, an American man wears a loud suit, smacks his gum, and says \\"OK\\" a lot, although at least a little of this is revealed to be an intentional misdirection on his part).  I spent most of the book frustrated that some of the second-tier investigator characters weren't noticing some of the big obvious clues, but Christie surprised me when Poirot got around to explaining the meaning of the clues.        **MILD SPOILER ALERT**        The solution to the mystery, though, is simply nonsensical and unfair to the reader.  It is clever and brings an element of artistic/moral satisfaction, but it just doesn't correspond to human behavior at all.  However, I am intrigued by the almost postmodern way the solution challenges a reader's presumptions about mystery stories and presents almost an epistemological crisis (how do we know what we know?  We presume that the murderer is lying, but I think we implicitly trust at least a little of what other suspects say, especially when we see confirmation, and Christie rocks us with an ending based on layer upon layer of lies and manipulation.).  I can't exactly recommend this book, as the ending is too frustrating and the characters are too unbelievable along the way, but I find myself intrigued by the (I think) unintended philosophical challenges...
1601251505|5.0|Love this book. The price tag is a bit steep but it is both a players handbook and Dungeon master's guide in one so it is worth it. Play is smoother than Dungeons and dragons 3.5 and the classes are more balanced from what I can see. Also 3.5 D&D backwards compatible which is a plus if you are like me and have a bookshelf full of now outdated books.
0743454537|4.0|\\"My Sister's Keeper\\" by Jodi Picoult is an intriguing, well written book.  It deals with sisters Anna and Kate.  Anna was conceived after her older sister Kate was discovered to have a type of cancer, with the intention that Anna would be a match with Kate and could donate blood, marrow, etc. to Kate in order to help her stay healthy.  When Anna's parents inform her that Kate now needs a kidney, Anna decides it's time to take control of her life, and she hires a lawyer to win emancipation from her parents, so that she won't be obligated to give any other body parts to her sister.  The story follows the family through this heart-wrenching situation, as we see the story from everyone's viewpoint, and how they have come to the beliefs/thoughts on the subject that they have.  With a typical Jodi Picoult surprise twist at the end, this book is a great read, and one that I would recommend to anyone!    (The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

0143116177|4.0|Niall Ferguson's \\"The Ascent of Money: A Financial History of the World\\" provides one with the framework necessary to develop a sound understanding of money and capital markets. The release of the book in early 2008 was particularly timely, as the global financial crisis was gaining momentum.<br /><br />Ferguson takes the reader though nearly 4000 years of relevant financial history. Each chapter is dedicated to the development of various financial tools and instruments, including: fiat money, credit, bonds, equity, insurance and real estate. He then proceeds to describe the meaning behind modern day buzz words, such as hedge funds, globalization, and computer investment models.<br /><br />Again, the author's background in history leads one to believe that knowledge of financial history is necessary in order to avoid a financial crisis. Ferguson reaffirms this point by stating: \\"[t]o put it bluntly, the Nobel Prize winners had known plenty of mathematics, but not enough history.\\"<br /><br />To build on this, one can conclude that the efficient markets hypothesis did indeed fail to explain what history has shown in the past, simply put: all bubbles burst. The markets and rational investors failed to correct the markets and price the assets at their true value. It is eye opening to see the similarities between the Dutch Tulip crisis, the Great Depression, the fall of Dot Coms, and the present housing bubble.<br /><br />In the chapter regarding globalization, Ferguson stresses the importance of Chinese-American relations (Chimerica) on the world. These two countries are singled out, because they \\"account for just over a 10th of the world's land surface, a quarter of its population, and a third of its economic output, and more than half of the global economic growth of the last eight years.\\" He partially attributes the current financial crisis to the balance of trade between China and America (where the prior saves while the latter spends).<br /><br />While Ferguson does a wonderful job creating a survey of relevant events that helped shape the modern financial system, at times the emphasis placed on the role of finance in history seems to be overinflated and one-sided. For example, Ferguson took a significantly different approach identifying the turning point in the American Civil War. According to the author, the capture of New Orleans was far more crucial to the success of the Union than the fall of Vicksburg a year later. His argument is based on the assumption that the south was no longer able to deliver its primary export, cotton, to pay for its collateralized debt obligations in Europe. Europeans perceived Confederate bonds to be risky investments, and refused to buy them without collateralization; therefore, fall of New Orleans led to the failure to deliver cotton, and in turn resulted in a default. Since no further financing was possible, the Confederacy suffered from hyperinflation and virtually went bankrupt. There is no doubt that this has been a very important factor in the Union's victory, yet the author completely ignores a number of other crucial events; such as Union's capture of Forts Henry and Donelson in 1862, or the fall of Atlanta in 1865. It is also very well possible that it was the specific people in power who resulted in such turn of events. Perhaps the superior leadership abilities of General Grant and President Lincoln were the reason for Union's success, and if they were not yet alive the events would have taken a different turn. One could even go as far as to say that leadership abilities are the primary factor, as without them New Orleans would have stood free, with exports flowing freely and feeding Confederate treasury.<br /><br />This book serves as a reminder that key components of the modern financial system were not invented in New York in the last decade. Instead, they take from their roots deep within thousands of years of history, and work to shape the system today. While understanding mathematics is important, the numbers are worthless without understanding of the historical background.ithout understanding of the historical background.
B0039TD7RC|2.0|I've been eagerly awaiting this re-release since it was first announced, and my worst fears are realized. With the highly overrated Don Was at the helm I knew this would happen. It is so hyper-compressed and limited it sounds like holy CRAP! A full 8dB louder than the original CD release, vocals are pushed back in the mix, horn parts are barely audible, all of the traits of an over-mastered album. Granted the original CD was strident in the upper midrange, but you could compensate with a touch of eq around 3k or so. This, you can do nothing with. I only give this two stars because the album is so great even Don Was can't completely screw it up.

B002VPE1B6|1.0|I honestly don't know how anyone over the age of twelve can like this movie, besides the effects. I can't handle psychadelics anymore, so why would i care about visual effects. One review said something about people not liking it because they lean to the right.  Come on man. Even if i wanted to cut down every tree and wipe out every indigenous tribe that ever walked the planet i wouldn't dislike the movie because it preached against me.  Tarkovsky could have done more with one long shot in a bathroom stall, a single hanging light bulb and a piece of duct tape, loosely based on a Fellini movie based on midgets. The teenagers that were also viewing the film described it best when they were looking for little wayne and brittany spears the entire movie.

0785134352|5.0|Mark Millar's Kick-Ass is the best comic book ever! It is by far the best comic book I have read since I have blossomed into a full-blown comic book geek not so long ago. Kick-Ass is the story of Dave, an average teenage comic book geek, like your humble author, who wonders why no one has ever tried to be a superhero? He then proceeds to try to be superhero despite the fact that he has no superpowers. This then leads to a series of incredibly violent beat downs, one of which ends up on Youtube and gives him his monicker of \\"Kick-Ass\\". While on his unconventional hero's journey, he meets other lunatics like himself, including a sword-swinging 11-year-old girl assassin. Dave also enters into a relationship with the girl of his dreams (it doesn't go the way he, or pretty much any of us, would like it to go though). Interestingly enough, it started making me wonder why no one has ever tried to be a superhero in real life. Life imitating art I suppose. Anyway, if you are a fan of delightfully subversive comics and does not mind gratuitous blood, gore, violence, and sexual content, then Kick-Ass is the comic for you! Also makes a great gift for those in need of gifts.

0385504225|2.0|The more I think about this book, the more disappointing it was. I would say that only 40% of the book involved an actual plot, and the rest was the pseudo-psychological-religious ramblings of a man trying to fill his publisher's page quota. This book was painfully slow in places, and, in fact, the reader isn't even told why the outcome affects the life of more than 1 man (or why he should care) until right before the climax. And even then, [SPOILER Alert] the only thing that really hangs in the balance is the public image of the Masonic Lodge. In the end, if the bad guy totally gets his way, he would kill ONE person, and the Masons will have to hire a publicist to do some public relations work. Oh no! I hope the educated moron, Robert Langdon, can save the day. If anyone cares, I'm done with Dan Brown and his watered-down milk, at least until he can write a book with a little meat on its bones.

B00005Y7PS|5.0|It has all the earmarks of viking metal (anti-judeo-christian, mentions Odin and Thor, etc.).  It is even named after the sword God!  This might not be the most original of Sabbath's works, in fact the only remaining member from the more memorable lineups is Tony Iommi (singers have come and gone, but Sabbath has always been Iommi's baby), but the tracks on the album are varied and flawlessly executed.  \\"Anno Mundi\\" is an amazing opener which has an enchanting dramatic build and vocal harmonies that are not typical of sabbath.  In fact, this quality supplied by Tony Martin permiates the whole album.  \\"Battle of Tyr\\", \\"Odin's Court\\", and \\"Valhalla\\" compose an epic mythological trilogy.  The rest is standard Sabbath fare: \\"The Law Maker\\" is fast, \\"Feels Good to me\\" is slow, \\"The Sabbath Stones\\" is dark, and \\"Heaven in Black\\" is just awesome (you can still hear Dio's lingering influence).  The overall tone of the album seems to be urging the listener away from the drudgery of modern organized religion and into a more heroic model, but than again, I might just be a biased heathen.  This was one of the first albums I ever heard which had a Norse Mythological theme running through it (well, half of it anyway) and my main complaint is that it is too short, probably due to the limitations of vinyl.  In any case, this is the best album you have never heard of!
0307454541|4.0|I was told that this was a must-read and a can't-put-down. I found it to be exciting but perhaps not up to the hype.<br /><br />The character of Lisbeth is brilliantly drawn and unforgettable, and I look forward to reading Larsson's other books featuring her. I, for one, found the central mystery to be fascinating and the solution both fair and difficult to predict. Where I had a problem was with the Wennerstrom subplot: I expected much more to come of this, and the book's ending, tying up that loose end, was ultimately unsatisfying. Larsson never really connects that subplot with the mystery involving Harriet Vanger. Ultimately, that makes the book too long.<br /><br />Frankly, I was less impressed with Lisbeth's computer hacking skills, which almost seemed like a form of magic that Larsson inserted. than with the creative use of photography to solve the mystery.
B00009YXHN|5.0|Just as James Wales' BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN managed to surpass his own Gothic masterpiece, Brian Yuzna's BRIDE OF RE-ANIMATOR also manages to outdo Stuart Gordon's original in many ways. Picking up only a few years after the disaster in the Miskatonic University morgue, BRIDE finds Dr. Herbert West and Dan Cain returning to their questionable practice of re-animating the dead as they attempt to build the perfect being out of choice pieces of flesh that they have 'borrowed' from Arkham cemetery. Dr. Cain professes a selfless desire to help heal the wounded with the fruits of their research, but unlike Dr. West (who quite openly admits to his own selfish desires), Cain secretly hopes to revive the heart and brain of his dead girlfriend within the body of their new pet project. Jeffrey Combs and Bruce Abbott continue to create a perfect synergy on screen, though their performances are a bit more reserved than before. David Gale also returns as the bodiless head of Dr. Hill, who has plenty of new torments to unleash upon his enemies. In addition to a substantial amount of gore, Yuzna injects the film with the same deliciously dark humor that lined Paoli's earlier script. The creative geniuses at KNB EFX Group also introduce a massive array of imaginative designs that are as hilarious and ironic as they are disturbing. BRIDE is very much the twisted take on BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN that it intends to be, and in all of its absurdity it proves to be a winning sequel that recaptures much of the brilliance found in the original film.<br /><br />-Carl Manes<br />I Like Horror Movies

B000002HMH|4.0|Okay, I have to admit that this album has sentimental value for me.  I listened to it quite often in high-school (I have very vivid memmories of walking down the hall looking at all the Brittney wannabees while listening to \\"Wasting my Hate\\").  That being said, this experiment of Metallica's is vastly superior to the disaster that was \\"Saint Anger\\".  I would imagine that the commercial viability of the black album allowed Metallica to take a departure from the usual thrash metal which the band did so well in the eighties.  To most, this was a betrayal, but there are a few songs that really stand out particularly as a balance to some of their more loud and fast works: \\"Bleeding Me\\" and \\"Outlaw Torn\\" are particularly good as they are both slower fair and yet incredibly emotionally powerful.  \\"Hero of the Day\\" Is actually upbeat (who'd have thunk it?) and do I detect some surf guitar in \\"Until it Sleeps\\".  Of course, it has its share of low points.  \\"The House that Jack Built\\" is a great song but should be played twice as fast.  \\"Mamma Said\\" is a feeble and typically depressing country song.   The last half of the album runs together and while \\"2x4\\" is a nice bluesy offering, most of the other songs are not musically interesting, although the lyrics (when not being emo) are rather creative.  But the variation in Metallica's sound, albeit not well executed, is well worth adding this to your collection.
B0002F6AH0|5.0|The World At War is easily one of the most in-depth,<br />articulated war documentaries available; other shows<br />only pale in comparison. The extensive amount of old<br />newsreels and interviews which I had never seen made<br />this historical journey with the dramatic narration of<br />Laurence Olivier all the more intriguing and enjoyable.<br />I've learned more from this effectively produced series<br />than I have from any history class or book, and what better<br />way to assimilate this knowledge than by pictures and sounds.<br />So few war documentaries can hold the attention of their<br />viewers with such a vastness of information as this series<br />does. And it's impressive too that this was produced nearly<br />4 decades ago, and 3 decades after much of this took place,<br />so the horrors of those wars were still vivid in the collective<br />conscious.<br /><br />The World At War gives us detailed accounts from survivors of<br />grisly battles with the Germans and Japanese; graphic film clips<br />and pictures of decimated Jews in concentration camps (some of<br />whom are shown being executed and bulldozed like so much cattle);<br />the incessant bombing of England by the Nazis; the bombing of<br />Pearl Harbor with detailed accounts by witnesses; grueling battles<br />in the wretched conditions of Africa and Burma; Germany's defeat<br />in Stalingrad and Hitler's subsequent decline; numerous battles<br />fought near Japan's neighboring islands; the bombing of Nagasaki<br />and Hiroshima; mass propoganda from all nations involved;<br />political turmoil, treachery and the relinquishing of power; the<br />tribulations of civilians, and much much more.<br /><br />Initially hesitant about purchasing this set, I can easily say<br />that it was well worth the price as this series will provide me<br />still with future viewings.
B0001VV1GK|1.0|We received this Plantoys set as a gift for our younger son. When we opened it, several of the wooden pieces were infested with wood-boring bugs or beetles of some sort.

B000784WMW|4.0|I enjoyed this version very much. The only thing I think it is lacking is the final conversation between Helen Burns and Jane Eyre. That scene is in almost every other adaptation I've seen and I am not quite sure why it was left out of this one. Out of all the versions that I've seen this would be my number one pick with the 1973 BBC version (starring Socha Cusack and Micheal Jayston) in a close second.

Each time Christopher had to face something new and difficult, he would take the time to find a way to accomplish his goal.

B003BKF696|3.0|Must any and every indie rock release which slightly tweaks an already well-worn approach (aside from being derivative and simplistic) get misconstrued as the second coming upon arrival? Because if this constitutes high-level songwriting in the field these days, the genre is in a sorry state indeed.
B002UZCJ8Y|4.0|This is somewhere between I Robot and Hardwired (which I just reviewed and Hated). It even stars James Cromwell in the same role he played in I Robot. How weird is that!? Anyway.........Here's the scoop. Yes this movie stars Bruce Willis, Radha Mitchell and James Cromwell but the real star here is the art department. Mannequins are inherently creepy and this movie is loaded with a bunch of them that are animated. They look human.....almost. They move like humans.....almost. So it really creeps you out. They're all just off enough to remind you they're not human. Most of the actors portraying surrogates do a really nice job so it adds to the creep factor of the whole thing.    In a nutshell, Willis and Mitchell are detectives on a case where not only do a couple of surrogates get wasted but their operators get wasted as well. This is not supposed to happen. The two begin to investigate and the rabbit hole gets deeper and deeper.    The story is descent enough and the actors do a genuinely fine job, though I'm not certain why they cast Ving Rames in his role. Big mistake. It just doesn't work. Like in the aforementioned Hardwired, they do make the mistake of figuring a very few people can bring down an entire system but by that time you've seen a lot of really cool stuff.    I liked this film better than the paid reviewers but I realize this isn't going to change anyone's life. It's just good popcorn level Sci-Fi film making. The production values are high enough to further the feeling of having a bunch of near humans running around.     If you're in to this sort of thing this film shouldn't disappoint so give it a go.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I stayed up till 3:30 with this book annd was not disapointed. Clary was strong willed, with a sarcastically sweet  attitude. Sometimes in this book the charecters would say or do something a little out of place. Then it would be explained in a later  chapter. In this book betrayal played a HUGE part. Also there is a twist that I dont think anyone could forsee. At some points I couldn't remember who was betraying who but all in all I loved this book. With underworlder parties flying motercycles and beautifully strong charecters, as another reviewer said &#34; You cant beat this book with a steel.&#34;
B00386OWUC|2.0|I'm no stranger to Michael Haneke's movies, especially when it comes to the ones that have often gotten much attention. Haneke is a very interesting person; however it also goes without saying that I have only seen one movie of his that I enjoyed: The Piano Teacher. What was great like that was its suspense buildup and its dark comedy. There are some scenes wher eyou don't know if you should be horrified or humord (BTW people, Haneke even said it himself that he looks at the movie as a Dark Comedy).<br /><br />However, Of all the moives I've seen (the mentioned PT, alongside Cache, Funny Games US, White Ribbon and Seventh Continent), I've only really enjoyed PT. I find the trouble with Haneke is that his movies, while they aim for something, end up making Haneke someone who hates his audience. For example, Funny Games, a movie I despised, tried to get the \\"Kids, violence is bad, mmkay?\\" message across, but ended up beating the piss out of the audience with it. It's almost as if he has no respect for his audience, and like my dad always said, \\"Difference doesn't equal talent\\".<br /><br />The White Ribbon, while being slightly better than the average Haneke movie, is unfortunately a hair different than the rest. What managed to keep me interested was its gorgeous B&W cinematography; it was very creepy brooding. However, the film's snail pace and shallow story prevents it from getting anywhere, and in the end, the film relies on its gorgeous cinematography to carry on for two and a half almost pointless hours.<br /><br />Basically here we have an interesting concept- taking place in a town in pre-WWI Germany, a series of disturbing happenings including an (overly fake and CG'ed) accident which happens at the beginnng. More disturbing crimes keep happening, and nobody will admit to doing it, which leads to resentment towards the town leaders. More accidents keep happening and people still don't know who is responsible; though it is hinted at times that the Children could be the people in charge.<br /><br />This sounds interesting. That's what I thought before entering the theatre. However, since most of the accident scenes are simply implied, the movie's mystery becomes harder and harder to follow. What is even more frustrating is how Haneke ends the movie without even providing a proper resolution. But while that worked for \\"The Piano Teacher\\" because it left the viewer with a sense of foreboding, here it just leaves the viewer angered.<br /><br />In short, this movie was a mediocre way to spend 140 minutes, which felt longer, and while Haneke may be making art, art is as art does and the movie does very little. In short, it's a very grand argument in style over substance, though I guess would be recommend worthy for its B&W visuals.ge.    This sounds interesting.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I read all the reviews before buying this video because I couldn't decide which product was worth my money. In the end I bought this one. Now, there are quite a few comments I'd like to make regarding the people who gave this product bad reviews.    1. For those that complained that this injured them - if you got injured then you are obviously not doing something correctly and that is in no way the videos fault. Stop working out and watch the video. You should in no way injure yourself. It is jumping jacks, push ups, jumping rope, weight lifting exercises, and jumps. If you do the exercises right you will not hurt yourself.   2. For those that complained that you can't fastfoward through the introduction, I have no idea what you are talking about. I can hit the menu button on my remote and it brings me right to it and I start the video. You are obviously technology challenged and again, this is not the videos fault. But, like I mentioned, I had no problem jumping right to the \\"begin workout\\" menu.   3. For those that complained that there is not enough instruction, again go buy a for basics workout video. All it takes is one time through to learn what to do. If you don't know how to do a sit up or a push up or jumping jacks or jump rope then that is not the videos fault. If you are having trouble watch the entire video first then run it again doing the workout. I can't speak for everyone but I've been doing this video for over a month now and if I had to wait and listen to Jillian tell me how to do EVERY exercise EVERY single day I would throw it out the window.   4. This is a great workout dvd that is good for those wanting to lose weight and get in shape. You have 3 levels, each only 20 minutes long. Once you get comfortable enough with the level 1 workout more on up. You will sweat, be sore, and feel great.
B0007XT87G|5.0|Deadwing has to one of Porcupine Tree's best yet. There isn't one bad song on the whole album, and Porcupine Tree does a wonderful job of switching back and fourth between soft and heavy in their songs which is really cool when you think about it. Wilson, Harrison, Edwin, and Barbei all have such control over their intruments, its incredible. Open Car and The Start Of Something Beautiful, in my opinion, are the best songs on the album because they just so evenly flow from one to the other.     I guess my point is this album is a masterpiece, and I hope Porcupine Tree continues to create more. The Incident was a hit, so my expectations are high!!
B002XTBE8I|1.0|This is Eminem's worst album to date. This is Dr. Dre's second worst album to date (first being 1996's Aftermath). I have no idea how it sold so well, must have been on Eminem's legendary name only. I was shocked how bad his new music was after his 5 year hiatus. I can't stand the Arabic/Indian accent he does on every track. Lyrically he kills it as usual, but the songs are just boring.<br /><br />There were one or two good tracks on this album. I'm glad to hear he is back to just killin tracks like Forever, Drop The World, the Despicable Freestyle, and Not Afraid. &lt;&lt;THAT is the real Eminem I know. But this album was terrible.<br /><br />I am a huge Eminem and Dr. Dre fan, but wow, this album is terrible. I was really shocked how bad it was.
B003BVK2ZS|5.0|I love books about books - not only do I think that the  not-so-obscure references to other books and characters are a little bonding between the author and me (they're not - but I like to think so) but they also enlarge my already too-long-reading-list.<br /><br />In this book the author shines a light on the world of collecting in general and the little known world of rare book collecting specifically.  Ms. Bartlett writes her fascinating narrative while trying to understand John Charles Gilkey, a man with no real job and no real address and whose only passion is acquiring rare books by any means necessary.<br /><br />What makes this book, in my opinion, is the fact that Ms. Bartlett met with Gilkey several times, in prison, after he was released and even at a bookstore he stole from.  Gilkey talks about how he \\"acquired\\" the books, boasts about his crimes and even tries to justify them to us - which doesn't really work.<br /><br />Another compelling character in the book is a dealer named Ken Sanders who made it his mission to capture the person or persons who were stealing from California based book shops.  This is no small feat in a business where admission of theft is akin to lost revenue (because clients won't trust you to sell their books for them) and the amounts stolen as well as the objet d'art are of no, or very little, interest to the local Constables.<br /><br />The author peppers the book with anecdotes about past thieves and builds a very interesting narrative around a story which otherwise would make a meager subculture take notice, but skid on the sidelines for the rest of us.<br /><br />As a collector whose objects of passion have spiraled beyond his meager means to continue collecting them, I certainly understand Gilkey's frustration (after all speculation ruins every hobby once it turns into a business) but I find his justification for stealing abhorring, nonsensical and immature.  From what I gathered, Gilkey is a manipulative con man and a thief - not a bibliophile.
0307389839|3.0|I picked this book up because I'm a fellow marathoner and ultra runner and thought I'd give Murakami a try.  Having said this I must admit that it is not much of a running book.  He is such an ordinary runner and his stories are so typical that it gave me little motivation to keep reading.<br /><br />I can say that the book is very well written and there are some great points and even a few places where I could really relate, but it just does not come across powerful from a runners perspective.<br /><br />On a good note the prose is artful and even through translation it flowed nicely and made for an often uplifting read.<br /><br />If you are looking for a Dean Karnazes type of book you are looking in the wrong place.  If you are a marathoner, you have probably run farther and faster than Mr. Murakami, but if you are looking for some inspiration and some tips about how running fits into his life and is even a big part of what gives him real meaning to life then this is the book for you.

Switching back and forth between Jacob and Bella's perspective was a bit confusing.<br /><br />Having said that, I did enjoy this book, which tied everything in the series together so long as I allowed myself to continue the \\"willing suspension of disbelief\\" at more levels than I perhaps originally anticipated.  As in some of the other books, I felt some scenes were a bit drawn out (ie: Bella's pregnancy and the Volturi confrontation at the end) but it did not stop me from \\"reading just one more chapter\\".<br /><br />J.R.

030745455X|5.0|I first read this book from the local library. Now with the two follow-up stories and the Swedish movie versions, I felt I needed to own the whole series and reread them again. The first book in the series is The Girl Who Played With Fire, and I have to admit, it took me a while to get into this book, but once I did, I was IN. I wanted to know more and the character of Lizbeth Salander, who she is, why she is the way she is, and what makes her tick. Without revealing spoilers, she's a character who's been knocked about but keeps getting back up, and a character I want to know more about. Thank goodness Stieg Larsson wrote two more books featuring Lisbeth Salander, one other of which I've read, and the third which I've pre-ordered. Also, the first movie coming out of Sweden for this book was very very faithful to the book and to the characters. Noomi Rapace IS Lisbeth Salander and I think it's a shame that instead of promoting these Swedish sub-titled movies, the US feels like they need to make their own versions. I'm from the US, I can and don't mind reading subtitles.

1416562605|3.0|\\"The White Tiger\\" is your classic rags to riches tale despite the cover blurb claiming otherwise. If you've seen \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" you'll be familiar with the premise: young boy grows up in crushing poverty, makes a few daring decisions, and then ,after one final, large obstacle, succeeds at moving away from his poor background and becoming rich. The difference here is that in \\"Slumdog\\" the boy goes on a gameshow while the boy in this book, Balram, murders his employer and steals a bag of money.<br /><br />It's not a terrible book. The plot - boy murders employer - is interesting in that I wanted to find out how he did it and what happened but there's so much dross to go through in order to get there. The \\"facts\\" about modern India in case you weren't aware - the government is corrupt, people in the rural areas experience illiteracy, devastating poverty and are very religious, the cities are full of poor and rich alike, there's a lot of traffic on the roads, and India is a hot country. A few anecdotes aside, there's not a lot here to hold your interest. And then we get to the murder and what dyou know? It's a murder. Happens very matter of factly and it's over. No extenuating circumstances that would differ from the narrator's assertion of murder, nothing to make you think \\"maybe there's something more complex to this\\" - nope. He murders him and takes his money. That's it.<br /><br />Balram, the narrator and driver/servant, reminded me of Ishiguro's Mr Stevens from \\"The Remains of the Day\\", in that they were both servants, both were first person narrators and both were infatuated with their employers to the point where their loyalty blinds their employers' actions until they can no longer fool themselves. The difference being that Mr Stevens was a complex and brilliantly realised character while Balram is merely an unlikeable cynic. There's no complexity to his character - he just wants to get ahead - but then there's no complexity to any of the characters in the book. His employer is first portrayed as enlightened having spent time in America but we find out he's not. Balram's family, while mentioned frequently, never become more than the sum of their parts - his gran is a traditionalist matriarch, his brother becomes the usual older brother turned serious father like figure, etc.<br /><br />It's a quick read and I managed it in a couple of sittings. Even though it's accessible and interesting to a point, I cannot fathom how this is Booker Prize winning material. It reads very much like a first novel even with clumsy Literary ploys - the framing device of a 300 page letter to the Chinese Premier (why was this done again?), and the tortuous metaphor at the end when Balram, for some reason it's never explained, goes to a zoo before he murders his employer and looks eye to eye with, yes, a WHITE TIGER. Well done Adiga, shoehorning that reference in at the last minute, it sits very awkwardly.<br /><br />Not a dreary book but very average, no wonder readers are quite ambivalent towards award winning books.ployer is first portrayed as enlightened having spent time in America but we find out he's not.

B00065GX64|4.0|This film came highly recommended by one of my college professors as a \\"must watch\\" film due to how good the film was as well as how Lang incorporated several things into his films that some films of the era did not. Having just finished the film a few hours ago, I can see why my professor liked it so much.<br /><br />M takes place in Berlin during the 1930s where a serial killer is at work. It is heavily implied that this isn't just an average killer- this twisted individual has been murdering children & has been implied to have done even more dastardly deeds to them at the same time. With the city both terrified & ambivalent to the murders- either accusing their neighbors with little cause or wondering why they should care- it is the city's criminal base that decides that they will step up & discover who the murderer is... and get rid of him themselves!<br /><br />While this won't be my favorite black & white thriller, this is something I can guarantee that I'll re-watch again. I loved how Lang managed to slowly build the tension of the movie as well as using great imagery (some of which is incredibly surreal to me) to heighten that tension. One of the most surreal scenes has to be the one where Lorre stalks his young victim, who is standing beneath a huge store window where an arrow continuously bobs up & down. It first seems to scream out to the audience the intent of the murderer, then pointing out the murderer himself as he later stands in front of the same window.<br /><br />As some of the other reviewers have stated, any people in the movie besides Lorre & his victims seem to be almost featureless & indistinguishable from each other & I can't help but wonder if that was purposely done by the director. This might irritate some viewers who want all of their main players fleshed out or more clearly defined. The quality of the movie was very good, so I'm guessing that Criterion worked out the kinks with their version of the film. There were parts of the film where my mind drifted a little, but overall the film was an incredibly good watch. The \\"court\\" scene with Lorre is one of the most well acted scenes I've seen in a long time. (Count me in as a new Lorre fan!)<br /><br />If you are a film student, you have to watch this film- it is incredibly good. If you aren't, then I recommend it anyway.

0143039601|3.0|The book starts off well with Kerouac meeting a young student of Zen Buddhism called Japhy Ryder and the two decide to climb the Matterhorn. I've been out to the Sierras myself and enjoyed the descriptions of the scenery, it reminded me of my time up there, sleeping in the forest, waking up in my sleeping bag covered in snow. It's really beautiful writing, and the story (a rarity for Kerouac, having a story) rushes forwards. There's also a nice buildup with Kerouac hopping freights, sleeping on beaches under the stars, etc. It's what makes Kerouac the writer he is. Kerouac, Ryder and Ginsberg have some nice back and forths debating poetry. Ginsberg's cynicism of Buddhism makes for an interesting and funny debate.<br /><br />After the Matterhorn episode though, around page 80, the story is basically told. Kerouac has no idea how to progress the remaining 100 pages. I guess the point of the book was to talk about Buddhism but I never felt Kerouac was a serious student of it. Buddhism promotes abstinence of sex, drugs, drinking, all of which Kerouac partakes of frequently. He's like a lot of people I know who are into Buddhism - they take the parts they like and pretend they're the real thing. They're not, and neither is Kerouac.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Kerouac's writing becomes even more meandering as he rambles on with pseudo-profound writing. Here's an actual quote which he thinks is enlightening: \\"Form is emptiness and emptiness is form and we're here forever in one form or another which is empty\\". See what I mean? And this goes on for 100 pages!<br />\\"On the Road\\" wasn't as revelatory to me as it was to some of my friends. It was disjointed, a bit annoying, not nearly as clever or interesting as it thought it was and ultimately quite boring. 10 years later, I decide to give him another try with \\"Dharma Bums\\" and initially I thought it was going to be great. What happened was that Kerouac's enthusiasm and naivety got in the way of the writing.<br /><br />It would be too easy to type down passages from the book that shows how shallow the book's attempts at mysticism are or how Kerouac's writing makes him sound like a wide eyed innocent and inexperienced 13 year old from the country setting foot in the city for the first time. Suffice it to say, if you didn't like \\"On the Road\\" you won't like this. Nor will you if you are a student of Buddhism. If you like Kerouac or are 15 years old, you'll probably get a kick out of this.<br /><br />I should mention the highlight of this edition was Jason's drawings. The front and back have brilliant drawings and he includes two comic strips on the inside flaps that are just great.

B002JCSWV6|1.0|I think Eastwood here lacks all of his directorial skill and puts out a simple-minded preachy film.<br /><br />The acting shows that Freeman can do a decent accent, but that's about it.  I am not a fan of Matt Damon, so my views on his performance would be biased.  I'll simply say he is as boring here as he is in any of his films.  He truly is the vanilla in Hollywood's spice rack.<br /><br />It would be difficule to not be preachy in the telling of this story due to the nature of it.  But there isn't one subtle bit of acting, direction, or writing that doesn't seem to be annointing Mandela for sainthood or Damon as being the \\"Great White Hope\\" of a new South Africa.<br /><br />Of course you would never see the decline that has happened in South Africa in the last couple of decades.  That would be against every bit of Political Correctness that Hollywood uses as one of its religions.<br /><br />But the greatest problem with this film, is that it's boring.<br /><br />Unless you are going in, with the need to feel good, in that self righteous, \\"gosh darn, that was a swell movie that speaks about the promise of diversity...yada yada yada\\"  then skip it.  Watch instead Stallone's soccer opus where his fellow inmates play against Nazis.<br /><br />It's incredibly horrible, but at least you can laugh while watching it.

B002MUAJ2A|5.0|I don't really view this as a how-to book or one that proclaims to be something revolutionary. Instead, its a couple of guys giving honest advice on starting a business.      It's aimed at taking the butterflies out of your stomach, giving you a different perspective on obstacles that might be in your way, and starting you down the path of starting your own business. They don't have any formulas for success or roadmaps for you to follow, just really good advice.     I was worried this book might be slanted toward the software business (which I have no interest in), but that wasn't the case at all. No matter what type of business your interested in starting, or even if your already running one, this book will provide a lot of good tips and motivation.    With that said, they do have software and tech example used to highlight their points, but I never felt like they where preaching to a  certain type of startup at the expense of excluding others from the conversation. Whenever they included examples from their own company (or others), I felt the examples where appropriate, unbiased, and never aimed specifically at software startups. They just had good, open-ended examples that enabled you to see how things could work for your own company, no matter what type of company your starting/already own. I never felt the topic of software or tech dominated the conversation.    In addition, the writing style and organization of the book made it enjoyable to read as well. They didn't try to interject humor, sarcasm, fluff, or be over the top in an effort to make the book more interesting. The writing style is really good, the topics interesting, and it moves along at a good pace. Very well done and worth the read.
0061730327|5.0|William Kamkwamba is a young boy from Malawi who has just been through one of the country's worst famines and survived. His father is a farmer who has trouble acquiring fertiliser for the barren land on which he works as the corrupt government makes such materials hard to get. As a result William's father has a hard time making a living so much so that he can't afford to pay to have his son educated. Yes, even basic education costs $80, what a great government.<br /><br />Unperturbed, William sets out to educate himself. His interests lie in science and engineering and the manuals he finds at the local trading centre inspire him to try his hand at a windmill. The materials for this aren't forthcoming as there isn't much wood around due to heavy deforestation, so he makes do with junk found lying around. After repeated failures, he is able to generate electricity from a bicycle dynamo attached to the top of the windmill. He powers his house's lightbulbs and 2 radios. He is 14 years old.<br /><br />The bulk of this book is devoted to the history of Malawi. The famine takes up a large number of pages and we learn a lot about the country's socio-economic plight. The prevalence of superstition in the minds of the majority of the population is contrasted with William's inspiring message of education despite money, of knowledge triumphing over ignorance.<br /><br />It's such an inspired story that you could easily imagine forming the basis of a Booker prize winning novel, made all the more powerful for being true. William's dreams take him further forward from the windmill to building a structure to provide irrigation for his father's fields. Remember Cervantes' novel Don Quixote where windmills represent delusion? Here they are turned around to represent hope.<br /><br />A couple of other points to make - whoever supplied the engineering manuals that inspired William in the first place ought to be congratulated and sends a fine message of charity and the spread of ideas through books into the world (and everyone thinks the book is dying. Ha!). Also, having seen William give a talk at TED a couple of years ago, it's clear that his English is limited so Bryan Mealer's rendering of William's voice in clear and captivating words should definitely be acknowledged.<br /><br />It's a powerful book of quiet hope amidst massive suffering and speaks to the resourcefulness of human beings. \\"I try, and I made it\\" says William. A true call of hope in our troubled times.(and everyone thinks the book is dying. Ha!). Also, having seen William give a talk at TED a couple of years ago, it's clear that his English is limited so Bryan Mealer's rendering of William's voice in clear and captivating words should definitely be acknowledged.

B0039OGGVQ|4.0|This is one of the best CDs I've ever listened to.  The only problem is that this version does not come with any of the bonus tracks...
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|I am at a loss for words after listening to this album.  I can't think of the last time I have heard such a powerful, complete, well-rounded body of work.  This album is a MUST BUY.  Nas is at his best lyrically...which is saying a lot since when he is just coasting he is still miles ahead of most rappers.  Damian is great lyrically & on the production of this album.  This is the most cohesive effort I have heard in years & by far the best two-genre collaboration I have ever heard.  This album deserves all of the critical acclaim, Grammy's and everything else.  It is THAT good.

B0024FA9IM|5.0|I am giving the Lost in Space Blu Ray 5 stars based only on the movie and the special effects in it.  The DVD was processed very well, and looks great when upconverted on an HD TV.  But, the Blu Ray looks and sounds even better.    However, the Blu Ray has no extras at all!!  You put in the disc, and the movie starts.  The DVD has a multitude of Extras.  There are trailers, 2 featurettes, and interviews with the original actors from the TV show.  And, it's all on one disc!  WHAT HAPPENED TO THE EXTRAS?
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|My only complaint with the specials is that there are only five of them!  David Tennant really has fun with the role of the Doctor.  The specials take the chance to explore the Doctor's character in greater depth, as he is without a steady companion throughout.  He really has to come to terms with what it means to be the last of the Time Lords.  All in all, these make for great viewing.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|OK great album its something different rap and reggae together is good for the soul. There were a few feature artist on the album but over than that this is a good buy, very powerful music. I enjoy nas but I never really heard Damian Marley music, its very good. Top 5 songs My Generation, As We Enter, Strong Will Continue, Count Your Blessings, and Africa Must Wake Up
B00005LOUQ|5.0|Only Jim Carrey can pull off this character very well. this movie is awesome jim carrey is awesome the costumes are awesome the actors are awesome. i just can go on and on about this movie. but i'll cut it short and say if you did not see then you should. peace
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Outstanding!  What a combination of influences to create a beautiful work by a gifted artist.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|I can't help but smile (even when I bawl like a baby at the end) every time I watch it. This film has such a positive message that motivated me to get back to the imaginative mindset that I had as a kid, rather than letting the negative, realistic influences in society today get to me. This film never fails to make me happy and fall in love with it all over again each time I watch it. You're missing out on something wonderful if you haven't seen this film. Go watch it!
B003DES8I6|2.0|A lot of violence, the attempts at humor were lame, the plot is week. This movie was a disappointment. Luckily I only spent $1.00 renting it through redbox.
B001V7YWTQ|2.0|These two artists were the forefront of rock, jazzrock, blues in the sixties and early seventies. Now, they definitely put out a labored, unexciting set. For anyone thrilled by live Cream, live Traffic esp. Last Exit--whats going on? Its sad there is no one to take on the mantle. Eric's Rainbow Concert has more excitement and tension--35 plus years ago...
0312323867|2.0|Darcy has always been the popular, pretty girl who has it all.  Then, weeks before her wedding to Dex, she admits her affair with groomsman Marcus, discovers Dex was cheating with maid of honor Rachel and then finds out she is pregnant.  After things with Marcus dissolve, she flees to London to crash with her childhood friend Ethan.  With her life in tatters, Darcy is forced to make major life changes and she finds happiness with Ethan, makes amends with Rachel (who marries Dex) and has her twin boys.    Although I am all for a story where the pretty girl eats crow, this story was too over-the-top.  No one carrying twins would go from a 4 to only a 6 at 5 months along.  No one at 30 who spends like Darcy could go for 8 months without working and still buy designer clothing and fly business class to London.  Ethan would never fall for Darcy given their history.  Someone as selfish as Darcy never would have had the babies in the first place and Marcus was just too stereotypically lame.
0312360258|5.0|This book sounded really interesting, but my parents says it's too graphic/ and vampire like! Yayy, for christian parents and their strict rules...........................................................
B002VPE1B6|4.0|This story could be taken as hubris/greed vs pure/untouched at racial, social, technological, environmental, etc. levels. It was very predictable but still very well done. Cameron plainly wanted to convey a message to which mankind has paid lip service but continues to ignore, sans any meaningful effort at remedy. If the film has a positive impact, great...but most likely on that front, it is simply preaching to the choir. All that having been said, I thought the story and the special effects employed in its telling were spectacular and more than enjoyable. The casting was on target and the performances were REALLY good.    Great addition to our library of films!
B001DJ7PQ4|5.0|I've been a Doctor WHO fan for a few decades now and throughly enjoyed the series.
0393072231|5.0|\\"The Big Short\\" is the latest from Michael Lewis who previously published \\"Liar's Poker,\\" \\"Moneyball,\\" and \\"The Blind Side.\\" In \\"The Big Short,\\" Lewis already knows what the media sources have told us. Therefore, the author appropriately asks and answers: who knew what was going on, and who knew that the financial crisis was going to happen.  As the financial crisis of late 2008 was not entirely an accident nor Black Swan event.  Who played it?  Who benefited from it?       And also, why did so many not know?  Why did so many claim they \\"didn't know,\\" and never saw this coming?  These \\"Not-Knows\\" both inside the financial world, and the \\"Not Know Pundits\\" in the media that are previously from the inside.  It turns out, that many actually did not know nor foresee any of the coming developments in the crash of 08 (and beyond).    8 people who had the knowledge, ability, and influence to wield, benefited from the sub-prime mortgage snafus, CDOs and Credit Default Swap derivatives.  The biggest and most loathed banks are mentioned as well as the Hedge Funds.  But Lewis adroitly paints these individuals with descriptive and comprehensive mini-biographies, detailed with specific actions taken by them.  A few people saw the house of cards for what it was.    False prosperity and \\"paper wealth.\\"  A new gimmick was created to loan people money they should have never been lent.  Knowing the borrowers would never be able to pay off the loans and default on these mortgages.  Those with knowledge and greed  + the ignorant borrowers + an avenue to create a scenario + regulator watch-dogs who don't even understand how these triple-Bs became fake triple-As = the train crash that we now have today.  The rest of the world is condescendingly laughing and they rightly should be.  These snafus say a lot about American society and many (but not all) American people.    The focus in this book is on Wall Street and the private sector, with practically no attention given to government entities and bureaucratic officials and politicians that enabled this corruption to cause the implosion that happened.  Implosion from within, is what it was.  Lewis also details the feeble attempts by the regulators to monitor and prevent this from happening again.  The consensus, is that this will happen again in the future.    The CDO bundling of mortgages into an investment package, falsely labeling them Triple-A, and then selling them to the world.  A scam.  Nothing more; nothing less.  One person noted in this book earned $45 million dollars in a single year selling these fake triple-A investment packages.  Who was ever held accountable?  Credit Default Swaps are also explained,  and here, Michael Lewis makes these complicated and confusing \\"financial instruments\\" understandable to the layman.    As usual in contemporary society today, that after all the damage is done, that people stand up, point their fingers, and find individuals and entities to blame - after, the fact.     The only gripe is that \\"The Big Short\\" should have had an index, photographs of the people involved, and some diagrams or charts, even thought he explanations were superbly written.    Lewis contends that the factors causing this crisis originated in the 1980s.  In addition to great writing and research, what makes \\"The Doomsday Machine\\" vital is that it's not about the Henry Paulson and other characters who've already been examined by the charlatan financial channels and the mainstream media.    This massive disaster that cheated and hurt so many, was orchestrated by a few to benefit the few.  Bring out the noose.  Lewis has a talent for writing.  Kudos to Meredith Whitney of Oppenheimer who led Lewis to these individuals that the media has never mentioned.
1423101472|5.0|A very flowing narrative, all sorts of excitments, great adventures and a bit of going back in time for the history classes, that´s what you are going to find in this book 5 of the Percy Jackson´s journey. I really recommend it. No matter how old you are.
B00386EZJU|5.0|This is a fantastic score to a great movie. It has to be one of the best movie scores, if not the best, in recent years. I love the movie and have seen it several times. The music captures everything the movie is: touching, exciting, sad, happy, joyous. A great mix of symphonic and Celtic-flavored writing, the music is a great asset to the movie and a very enjoyable listening experience. What I like most about this soundtrack is that it is in the order of the movie, so that when I listen to it the images that go with the music readily come to my mind. I love that. It is almost like watching the movie when listening to the music. This is a very special movie. The relationship between Hiccup and Toothless is one of the best. So is the music. Yay Hiccup and Toothless! The tracks Forbidden Friendship and Test Drive are wonderful (as are the scenes they accompany), but so is the rest of the score.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|As an alternative vision of the Robin Hood story, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.  It isn't perfect but is great entertainment.  The writers and directors have done an excellent job of reproducing a thirteenth century world.  The barons live under conditions not far removed from their serfs.  Everybody is unwashed and filthy and the floors of the liege halls are covered in old straw.  A bath is a splash of water and people sleep with their hunting dogs.<br /><br />I especially enjoyed 'Maid' Marion as an older woman who, like Penelope of Ithaca, has remained faithful to her war-lost husband for 10 long years.  She is one of the true heroes of the story, strong and noble at the same time.  Still, the writers tried to get it right.  Despite the fact that she lives a life not far removed from her 'subjects', she is still a noble.  Relations with a commoner--even a brave, attractive and noble commoner--approaches social and personal impossibility.<br /><br />Warfare is brutal and even our 'Robin Hood' character admits to an act of incredible evil.  Three thousand Muslims were slaughtered at Acre and our hero followed his King's orders and slaughtered a young woman at his feet.  Our man detests both himself and his King for what was done, tells him about it and....<br /><br />I also enjoyed the way the writers and directors developed the character of the initially juvenile and spoiled Prince John.  He matures but the film goes back on itself and ends rather weakly.  I understand this, because the producers hope for a sequel, but it doesn't help the quality of the present film.<br /><br />Politically, the film is fascinating.  The Robin Hood story has always had heavy political and egalitarian overtones.  This film emphasizes it more than most Robin Hood stories.  Not once do we hear reference to the old Saxon-Norman rift.  It is a story of the power of the king against lesser men.  As such--despite the fact that the writers may not have intended it--there is much for worried constitutionalists to celebrate about this film.  Central governmental power is shown in a negative--even evil--light.  Yeah.....rate about this film.  Central governmental power is shown in a negative--even evil--light.  Yeah.....
1577314808|5.0|This book was required reading in my 200-hour Yoga Teacher Training and I am so grateful it was assigned to us. Eckhart Tolle's ideas echo many in Buddhism and meditation, but the way he presents them are so simple and rhythmic that one almost falls into a trance when reading his words. There is power behind Tolle's words. He is not explaining a concept for your mind to grapple with; he writes in a way that almost suspends \\"thinking\\" which is exactly what he wants you to do. It is thinking, living in the past/future, anywhere but HERE and NOW that causes human being so much misery and dissatisfaction.<br /><br />There are several concepts Tolle presents that are at the core of living in the NOW. Among them are: dis-association with the pain-body (mostly for women) and thinking (mostly men); understanding that past and future are ILLUSIONS and that we have no control over what has happened (past) and what is yet to be (future), so give up the struggle and just live NOW; that we are all connected, that we can plug into cosmic consciousness if we can stop associating ourselves with mind (ego) and experience living in the present where we are truly in the flow of life.<br /><br />One of the concepts I found most fascinating was his explanation around the manifest and unmanifest. The manifest contains the seeds of the unmanifest (all life must die; what is in form now will eventually return to dust) and the unmanifest contains the seeds of the manifest. What is manifest is simply what already existed in unmanifest (Source) brought to form. This small shift in perspective opened my eyes to the potential of creativity.

B000001FOL|3.0|nico is not an easy personality or artist to understand. it's even harder to understand why someone of her 'stature' would be so fond of singing jackson browne covers. be that as it may, i am still at the point where, after several listens, i still find myself lost in her voice, wondering, 'i like nico, i like nico not.' her voice remains haunting and amateurish, like a mentally disturbed academic finding an outlet in singing odd covers.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|I rated this series one star, because if you invest more than 200 million dollars in a story, you can't place main characters like the ones in \\"The Pacific\\". This is much less than I expected from Spielberg and also Hanks, after \\"Band of Brothers\\", unfortunately, the writhers failed to provide action and flow to the series you can't ever connect with the characters and their roles as in \\"Band of Brothers\\", the quality of The Pacific as a story is poor and really disappointing. \\"Band of Brothers\\" was the best war/action series ever made, but \\"The Pacific\\" was more than a huge mistake is just a piece of crap, it didn't deserve a place in my over 1500 DVD & Blu-Ray collection.
B001FB55HQ|1.0|In terms of big Hollywood movies, I feel like there are 2 kinds of bad movies: (1) There's the type of bad movie that has the sheen of being good just b/c it has an A-list director and actors and smothers the viewer with big words and an overly \\"serious\\" tone and lots of emoting, but deep down is as empty as an abandoned building, for example, THE DARK KNIGHT! That movie is nothing and I freely gave it only 1 star. (2) Then there's the type of bad movie that is so in-your-face BAD that it can't be denied and TERMINATOR SALVATION is THAT movie! Ironically, both movies star Christian Bale (who plays John Connor in this) and guess what? There's a strong connection, b/c just like in TDK, in TERMINATOR SALVATION, Bale also uses the SAME raspy voice again...WOW!    I knew TERMINATOR:SALVATION (TS for short) was doomed from the start, opening in 2003 (pre-apocalypse) with a character and story that seemed totally disconnected from all the previous Terminator films. And I KNEW that in the end, the explanation would not make any sense and be a total violation of all that had been established in the first 3 Terminator movies: just another fancy Hollywood gimmicky \\"twist\\" ending designed for shock value, and it wasn't even that shocking as the \\"twist\\" had already been spoiled in the trailers. This character is condemed criminal Marcus Wright (played by newcomer Sam Worthington) and the movie opens with him on death row about to be executed, but not before he signs away his body to be donated to a cancer-stricken Cyberdyne scientist (played by Helena Bonham Carter).     The post title scene introduces us to John Connor (Bale) and I've got to say that I think that Bale is the WORST portrayal of John Connor in all the films! I actually didn't like Furlong that much in T2 as he was cliche, but I think Bale is worse than the kid. Nick Stahl in T3 is the best portrayal by far. Bale spends the whole movie rasping, grunting, yelling, \\"thinking\\" and it is annoying to watch. In fact, Idare say that Bale himself seems to almost be in a separate movie from everyone else...that is how disconnected his story is. While all other actors feel like part of the movie (albeit not a very good one!), Bale appears to be in his own world above all the proceedings.     Worthington's Marcus Wright is the real main character and the movie tracks his story until it intersects with Connor's, leading to the climax and conclusion. Wright's tale is the standard by-the-numbers fare with him trying to find the source of his troubles in 2018 post-apocalyptic California. Along the way, he meets the basic crew of cliche characters: the scrappy, green teenager who needs a push in the right direction Kyle Reese (played by Anton Yelchin, who actually gives a good performance among a sea of bad ones!), the little girl who doesn't speak (Newt from ALIENS, anyone?), the hot, tough-as-nails female who can take care of herself (Moon Bloodgood, obviously a fashion model in real life!), etc. Worthington is just OK as Wright, but he doesn't have to speak much. He plays the typical monosyllabic summer action movie hero who is more brawn than brains. In fairness to him and all the actors, the dialogue is atrocious and the plot thin.     Bryce Dallas Howard (Ron's daughter who seems to get a lot of thankless roles) plays John's wife Kate Brewster Connor (character was introduced in T3 played convincingly by Clare Danes). An issue I had was with the age of Kate...In T3, Kate was to be in her early-to-mid-20s or so, but in TS, it is now 15 years later and Howard actually looks younger than Danes did in T3?! I even think Bale is a little too young-looking to play Connor. In fact, all the characters are too \\"clean\\" in appearance to be living in indefinite subhuman conditions. And Bale and Howard don't have near the chemistry that Stahl and Danes did in T3. In T3, even in the short span of time it was set, the John-Kate relationship was convincingly established, but here they seem like complete strangers just thrown together and they've been together for 15 FREAKIN YEARS!    Also, where is the colorful, evocative, eternal nighttime setting that was so well-established in the future flashback/flashforward montages in all the previous Terminator films? In TS, 99.9% of the scenes are daylight and the cinematography is very off-putting and dreary-looking. Not to mention that the human resistance seems to have an endless supply of weapons to fight what few Terminators we get to actually see! There's supposed to be armies of machines, but instead, we get conveniently timed Terminators (one of which looks suspiciously like a robot from TRANSFORMERS!) and most of which look to be different in design...I thought all the early models (the T600s) were supposed to look the same?     The biggest faux pas though involves the subplot (or main plot, not sure which!) of Kyle Reese (who really shouldn't be introduced this soon) and why Skynet even knows of the connection between him and John Connor. Also, I found the climactic action scenes at Skynet uninteresting and convoluted, including how it was so easy for Connor to infiltrate the facility with little resistance (the sole purpose of machines is to track humans 24 hours a day but they can't take out ONE human in their own headquarters?) and of course the not-so-shocking revelation about Wright and his predictable actions thereafter.     TS, in general, just seems to be a patched together flick with big budget special effects (that aren't that impressive to me), a franchise-killing plot, and terrible dialogue. I say, \\"Do-over, please?!\\"
B000002KET|4.0|Sabbath was my favorite band back in the day. A new album was a great event. This album, as I remember, was particularly anticipated. Vol 4 was a great album but ventured in to new progressive, pop territory. I wasn't too crazy about that hint of a new direction. I liked my rock hard like the first three albums. But I loved Wheels of Confusion from Vol 4. Anyway, I always liked this album. It always sounded thin and flat to me. It has some great songs with great riffs. But it also continued on with having parts that made me wince. Sorry. That's just me. I know many people love the synthy poppy Ozzy stuff.  I don't. So, I play the cuts I like: SBS, National Acrobat, Killing Yourself To Live.  Sometimes I listen to the whole thing. One thing though, you knew these songs would shred live (and did).
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|I laughed the whole way through this book. I think his closer-to-real-life stories are so much more entertaining than his fictional ones. Highly recommended! You wont be dissapointed!
B000DZ6VAK|5.0|I love all of the Mozart piano concertos as performed by pianist Murray Perahia. Those are the performances upon which I based my assessment of the gamble I took buying this set of disks of the piano concertos performed by Mitsuko Uchida. I was apprehensive because not only did Uchida look rather cold, stiff, formal and overly serious in her photos, but other performances by the conductor who accompanies her, Jeffrey Tate, have sounded to me rather stodgy, with much of the life ironed out of them.    Boy was I WRONG! These performances are superb. They have depth and character, emotion, poetry and soul, all with brilliant technical precision. I have no idea how Mitsuko Uchida manages all of this, but she does in abundance.    Over the many months I have had both this set and the Perahia set of Mozart piano concertos, when I have wanted to listen to Mozart I choose this set more and more. I love Perahia's technical expertise and his personal expression, but I am more and more drawn to Uchida's interpretations.    If anyone buys this set and doesn't like it, they have no soul. Absolutely excellent.
B000EJ9VEI|5.0|I was never a fan of the X-Men comic books, but X-Men is probably the best action hero/comic book movie out there. Unlike many other such movies, such as [[ASIN:B000ICLRIO Fantastic Four [Blu-ray]]], which are simply an excuse to have a bunch of action scenes and special effects, X-Men actually has a well-developed plot, good acting, as well as impressive special effects. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan as the two main mutants make the movie, are fantastic add emotional depth, but X-Men also includes a strong supporting cast, including Hugh Jackman and Hallie Berri. Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised by X-Men. Definitely worth checking out, even if you're not usually into this type of movie.

The opening scene showing the landscape going to the Overlook is breath taking. The sound is great. Well worth the purchase.
B001PPGAJY|5.0|From the opening sequence, I knew this was going to be even better than the original X-Men. I loved the combination of Nightcrawler's attack on the White House with classical music. With Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan, this film has all of the great acting and special effects of the first, plus new characters such as Inferno and Brian Cox as the mad scientist. Highly recommended.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Any work, be it a poem, a book, a movie, or a TV series, should be evaluated for what it is, not for what it is not. So I suggest forgetting comparisons to \\"Band of Brothers\\" and let \\"The Pacific\\" stand alone, which it does very well. We Americans are so Eurocentric -- most of us are of European extraction -- that we know little of the Pacific side of WWII which, by the way, had been underway for almost two years before D-Day. The Army thought the Marines were condemned to anonymity in the vast reaches of the Pacific. Instead, from Guadalcanal to Okinawa, the Marines found eternal glory. They conducted one of the longest and most successful campaigns in all military history. They were the only branch of the U.S. military with the doctrine and the equipment to show up on an enemy beach, knock down the door, and take real estate away from the enemy. We know about the eight-day Battle of the Bulge because books and movies have been done on that topic. This series shows us the six-month campaign for Guadalcanal when the Marines were abandoned on a hostile shore by the US Navy; they had no George Patton to bail them out, all they had was each other. The series shows us how the Marines did one \\"forcible entry\\" after another as they marched toward the setting sun that was Japan. We see how inconsequential little postage stamp islands were sanctified by the blood of U.S. Marines. \\"The Pacific\\" shows us the Marine Corps heritage of valor that goes all the way back to Belleau Wood. Every American should thank God for the United States Marine Corps. This series shows us why. So, to Spielberg/Hanks, I say Bravo Zulu.
B002NXSRVG|1.0|Terrible movie on so many levels - where do I begin.  And I am someone who was a hard-core GIJoe fan when I was a kid in the 80's:    - Plot was tepid and predictable  - GI Joe is the Real American Hero - this was the Real \\"WORLDLY???\\" hero?  Seems like some overly PC nutjob wrote the script  - Constant flashbacks was annoying and distractful    I could go on but long story short - Terrible movie.
0618918248|4.0|Though it's very insightful, thought provoking and uplifting (I'd recommend it to anyone), it might be a bit too thought out, if that can actually be a problem. I can sum up the debate of science vs religion in one run-on sentance: Up until a few hundred yrs ago religion was science (mystical, social, physical, all of it), it filled the hole people had in their knowledge of the world, and it is now being rendered more obsolete by the day as everyday people have a vast amount of factual, substantiated information available at their fingertips 24/7 and that makes the head in the clouds thiest evermore uncomfortable.

0307269760|4.0|The latest collection of stories by one of the genre's best writers. Munro takes some dark turns here, reminding me of Joyce Carol Oates, but still remaining distinctively Munro. Subtlety, hints, and confessional conversation all move things along. Even when the the subject veers into horrific territory, Munro's characters are so well formed in these stories that we know how close we all can come to these crises.     In \\"Dimensions,\\" Doree visits her husband in jail to find answers to her tragedy, his crime.  A pair of stories, \\"Deep-Holes\\" and \\"Child's Play\\" visit places in the hearts of children who grow up twisted by differing influences. \\"Free Radicals\\" begins with a melancholy that develops into a desperate psychological game of wits.     The only story I couldn't really get into was the title tale, based on a real person, a 19th c. woman mathematician / novelist (Sophia Kovalesky),  who reminisces as she takes a train ride home through Europe. Altogether, though, a collection to savor.

B0039ZF8D2|5.0|I initially purchased this for a friend. He is a Marley & Nas fan and I thought that the combo would be cool. I wanted to see what I was sending so I listen to the samples. I couldnt stop listening to them here on AMAZON. I listened over and over and wanted more. I had to go out and buy my own CD today. Listened and Listening to the cd, I am feeln this! Its deep, soulful, live, and real.... Awesome CD. I am happy I purchased for my friend and for myself.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|I ordered this when it was first offered, pre-odered, but didn't get around to watching it until yesterday.....well, I guess I'm too old for this kind of animated movie......first, it put me to sleep early on.......started it over and in my opinion, the graphic's are fantastic, and I'd imagine the only way to really appreciate it would be to see it in a theater in 3-D.       The story however, leaves much to be desired, there barely is one.  I was reminded of so many other stories that we know so well.  There was \\"Pocahontas\\" and the same outrageous treatment we gave our Native Indians when we stole their land, and something seemed terribly wrong when \\"our\\" human servicemen were turned into uncaring conquerors who had no problem blasting away these fanciful \\"natives\\" for the ore that lay beneath their \\"sacred tree home\\".......ugh.  Somehow I missed the idea that \\"we\\" humans were in fact, the villains.  I don't know who wrote the screen play, but it felt like James Cameron made the small story up as he went along.  I really don't quite know what else to say about it.....but I can't agree that it deserved an Academy Award, perhaps one for art, the sets, and computer graphics were beautiful......but Best Picture?  No.

It is so rare to hear someone with a truly beautiful voice who just sings--no frills, no shouting, no embellishing for five minutes when one note will do.

I think I was born in the wrong era in terms of my musical taste, but this is one modern singer that I really enjoy. [[ASIN:B000297VQA Voice Lessons To Go Volume 1: Vocalize and Breath]]
B00005JPFH|4.0|Spider-Man 3 seems to take a lot of heat in many reviews, and compared to Spider-Man 2 (one of the best superhero movies ever), it doesn't hold up as well, but, all in all it's still a good movie.  The good: the story, although a bit crammed at times, takes our characters through quite a ride for two hours; the theme of forgiveness is powerful; the return of all the original actors is welcome and they all do an outstanding job; the Sandman was well cast and looks great; the action scenes are excting and well executed.  The bad: Topher Grace as Venom?  He's a fine actor, but doesn't even slightly resemble Eddie Brock; Peter Parker's hairdo while being influenced by the symbiote looks like Edward Furlong's in T2 and is a tad outdated; some of the charm that made the first two films so enjoyable seems to get lost in all that is going on.  Overall Spider-Man 3 is a solid movie; it's a shame that the series will not continue as there was plenty of story left to tell, and countless villains to bring to the big screen.  The special features on disc 2 are mostly average as far as special features go.  The best one was about the stunts in the movie-it was nice to see that it wasn't ALL CG.
B003M9AX0I|5.0|this show is fantastic, but i have a question for anyone who owns this show through Amazon VOD.    There is a review under the first season that says the music is different in the VOD version from the broadcast/DVD version.    is this true (for any of the seasons?)  i ask because i love this show and the music is just as important as anything else.    Thanks!
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|I admit she has a ton of influences from Broadway musicals, classical music, big band and hip hop, but its eclectic with a purpose. Its rare you get to hear albums that tell a full story. I think it's safe to say she is one of our more original artists willing to create a full vision. If you get her Metropolis album the full story is played out.    You won't hear anything else like this. Similar to when Prince came out with 1999 or Pink Floyd created The Wall. It has an epic feel to it even thought its not a million dollar record. American culture has evolved with music like this, we still got good musicians in this country.

B0019FOC5E|3.0|The movie soundtrack album was released in the summer, slightly before the release of the movie. The CD was released in Sweden and the UK on July 7, 2008 (and in the US on July 8, 2008). This album actually went to #1 in the USA, and in many other places. The movie soundtrack was actually more successful than the musical's original cast album, which has tended to sell at a slower pace in most of the markets it had been released. The soundtrack has sold over 4,000,000 physical copies worldwide including nearly 1,800.000 copies in the USA.     The music was recorded before the movie was filmed with the vocals sung by the original actors in the movie. On occasion, the actors also sang \\"live\\" during filming. The musical backing tracks were newly recorded in February 2007 by Benny Andersson with the help of three veterans of the original ABBA band (Rutger Gunnarsson on bass, Lasse Wellander on guitar, Per Lindvall on drums. An orchestra was used for parts of the backing track, and the chorus parts for the vocal tracks were recorded by the Stockholm ensemble cast of Mamma Mia. Two songs that were in the original musical are not sung in the movie- \\"Under Attack\\" and \\"Knowing Me, Knowing You\\". \\"Knowing Me, Knowing You \\"has been replaced by \\"When All is Said And Done'. Due to time constraints , the following songs are not included in the soundtrack album track listing -Overture / Prologue, Chiquitita, Entr'Act, One Of Us, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, and Waterloo.    The main drawback of the album is that so many of the performers are actors first not singers, and so most of the lead vocals are underwhelming. The vocal performances do have the kind of character that actors can instill, that sometimes singers can not.     Of course, even the best singers are not likely to improve on Frida or Agnetha's vocals, so instead the best approach appears to be try something slightly different and that's what is sometimes tried here.     Originally there was also supposed to be a special two-disc version of the soundtrack. The two disc version was to have included instrumental versions of songs that underscore the action in the movie, the end credits medley and god knows what else, but this idea never came to fruition, perhaps simply due to quality control concerns.

B001F5TAD2|4.0|One man's struggle is another man's accomplishment. \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is an intriguing book, which should be recommended to all due to the moral of the book, teaching you about friendship, and overcoming struggles.<br /><br />\\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a touching tale of the friendship between two men set against the backdrop of the United States during the depression of the 1930s. The book draws a reader such as myself due to friendship that triumphs over the odds. After analyzing the reviews, I came to understand that \\"Of Mice and Men\\" was not just a book, but also rather a novel of its time. Many students and adults in the world read \\"Of Mice and Men\\" today. A book, which catches the eye of all ages is a book worth reading due to it meeting the standards of various styles of audiences.<br /><br />The author uses variety methods of influence such as overgeneralization, bias, stereotype, and association in the novel. The novel examines many of the prejudices at the time: racism, sexism and prejudice towards those with disabilities. The significance of Steinbeck is that his writing treats these issues in human terms. He sees society's prejudices in the sense as separate (individual) problems and his characters attempts to escape from the prejudices. Steinbeck illustrates overgeneralization in the comment, \\"if you jus' happen to get in trouble like you always done before...\\"(pg. 15). This personal quote is considered as an overgeneralization due to Steinbeck prediction another's behavior.  Another example illustrated was association, \\"guys like us that work on ranches, are the loneliest guys in the world. They got no family\\"(pg. 13). Steinbeck was a man with a great deal of imagination due to him speaking of hard work for the characters to come.<br /><br />Steinbeck states, \\"Guys like us, that work on ranches, are the lonesome guys in the world\\" (pg. 13). This demonstrates validity and accuracy because Steinbeck illustrates the farming land in California where he was born. This quote also leads one to the belief of Steinbeck's background of always being away from family. Steinbeck also states in the novel, \\"Hit the jackpot\\" (pg. 10). This quote leads to Steinbeck's work being accurate because of the California gold rush.<br /><br />After analyzing others reviews, I want to believe that I agree with others reviews posted on Amazon.com. Prior to reading this book, I learned a great deal about Steinbeck and his significant novels. Steinbeck was a man who wrote many great novels which are being read even today in high schools around the country. \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a thriller, a gripping tale that you will not set down until it is finished.<br /><br />\\"Of mice and Men\\" is a book which I not only recommend to students, such as myself, but also to a variety of audiences'. People should continue to read \\"Of Mice and Men\\" because it will not only teach you about friendship, but  also about overcoming struggles.<br /><br />Senior English Student 2010s one to the belief of Steinbeck's background of always being away from family.

0143038419|4.0|I absolutely loved the first section of the book (re: failed relationships and then Italy); was bored to tears in the middle India/Ashram/Guru section, and therefore skimmed it quickly; and then enjoyed the Bali/Felipe section very much.  I would have voted 5 stars had the middle section not been such a drag.  Ms. Gilbert comes across as a bit self-absorbed, yes, but she also knows how to laugh at herself.  I thought she came across as very funny, kind and smart, and I definitely plan to read her other books.

0143117025|5.0|Everybody knows him -- the pipe-smoking detective on Baker Street (with or without the movie-added deerstalker), who is able to deduce all sorts of things just by glancing at a person. \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" shows off Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's first collection of short stories involving Holmes, mingling human psychology with sometimes bizarre mysteries.<br /><br />Holmes is visited by the masked King of Bohemia, who has a slight problem: he's engaged to a princess, but his former lover Irene Adler has a compromising letter that could jeopardize his future marriage. But Adler has a formidable brain of her own. Then Holmes is hired by a man who was hired by the mysterious Red-Headed League, and given a strange job... which is somehow connected to a criminal undertaking.<br /><br />Among the other strange cases that Holmes and Watson undertake -- a missing fiance, a strange murder in Boscombe Valley, a dead man who was sent five orange seeds, a woman whose husband has utterly vanished, a blue jewel hidden in a Christmas turkey, a dead woman whose last words were \\"it was the band, the speckled band!\\", a young engineer given a dream job, an American heiress who vanishes directly after her wedding, a broken beryl coronet, and a young woman given a surreally weird job.<br /><br />Sherlock Holmes mysteries come in two types:<br />1. The case is completely baffling, and Holmes is needed to unravel the knot of obscure clues.<br />2. The case seems straightforward, but Holmes is needed to connect seemingly unrelated clues to the crime in order to find the REAL perpetrator.<br /><br />There are plenty of both kinds in \\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes,\\" with a dozen cases that require Holmes' unique detecting skills -- it can be something as simple as locating a letter, or something as complex as foiling a robbery or counterfeiting ring. Doyle's stately, dignified prose is heightened by moments of excitement or horror (\\" It swelled up louder and louder, a hoarse yell of pain and fear and anger all mingled in the one dreadful shriek\\"), and he wove in a lot of human psychology into Holmes' cases.<br /><br />Holmes himself... is Holmes. Doyle didn't like his detective much, but Sherlock's knife-edged intellect and fascination with puzzles are strangely hypnotic -- even if you wouldn't like to be roomies with the guy, it would be amazing just to sit and watch him work. Watson is the perfect counterpoint for Holmes: he's not a genius but is definitely intelligent, warm-hearted and capable.<br /><br />\\"The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes\\" is a magnificent collection of Holmes' first twelve short cases, filled with murder, intrigue and all sorts of weird crimes.

0786939532|3.0|I began reading this book during the few months I began exploring the Dungeons and Dragons universe. While many of my friends that I knew from World of Warcraft had begun with the tabletop game and the world of Drizzt Do'Urden and graduated into the computer worlds of WoW (as well as Ultima, Everquest, etc), I was approaching the world of fantasy gaming from the \\"top-down\\" approach. While I have always harbored a strong nerdy side, it was only after begining to play WoW that I fully accepted that I was indeed a nerd. So, all that being said, I began actively exploring new universes to explore.<br />Homeland, as an opening book to a long series, presents a fair look into the dazzling universe of the Dungeon and Dragons race of the Drow. It does give a unique look within a society considered to be one of the evil in its home universe. This look is fairly uncommon in the world of fantasy literature (in my limited and novice review as yet). We see complex relationships develop within the Drizzt's family headed by Matron Malice and the uncharacteristic attitudes of the youngest son and his father Zaknafein. In these relationships, Salvatore plants a seed of endless plot and complexity.<br />However, the seeds go unfertilized. The world of D&D is one of intricate detail, one of immense scale, and one of unrivaled imagination. Yet Salvatore feels obligated only to scrape the surface of his imagination in developing these characters. I am left with a two dimensional view of characters with enormous possibilities. I am cheated of the evil and hatred of Matron Malice, the conflict and torment of Zaknafein. Even Drizzt is barely the pale blue image in my head, given only a scant development by the author. In the end, I pushed three stars probably based on my already well-entrenched affinity to fantasy writing in general. I have read worse, but I think Salvatore cheats himself and his reader with only 270-ish pages for a opening volley.<br />I will give one concilation. As I began reading this book, I was most of the way through one of the final books of Frank Herbert's Dune series. I may have been holding Salvatore up to a standard I did not know prior to devling into the immensely awesome Dune universe. Had I not read these books prior to Homeland, I most certainly may not have had the same gripes as I do now.ng this book, I was most of the way through one of the final books of Frank Herbert's Dune series.

0307454541|5.0|The story asks the reader to make an investment in the process by providing a good bit of background information and setting the scene without much action for the first third of the book.  But if you can hold out for the first 200 pages, it really benefits the progress of action in the remainder of the book.  The two main characters are drawn so well that you can get inside there heads as the ball starts rolling and you become part of the force that drives the story.  There is sufficient detail during the investigative phase to make the story authentic and the resolution is realistic and unpredictable.  There is an epilogue of sorts that is a bit unusual and quite delightful.  A great read!

Now the government, run by the ungodly and evil Kim Jong Il, is slaughtering its own people by the millions, and who is speaking out or doing anything to stop it?

B001N1DPDE|5.0|Very sturdy knife and much cheaper than other comparable high-end knives.  If you had to choose one affordable, high-quality knife to take with you to the \\"outback\\", this is it.    Suggested improvements (to an otherwise excellent knife): improve grip on handle, and a full flat-grind on blade.    Correction: The thickness of this knife implies hard/tough use so in this case a full flat-grind would not be preferable (for say, processing wood).
B002VWNICW|5.0|This is my favorite adaptation of the Jane Austen classic, and I have had the standard DVD version for several years. However, now that I have a blu-ray player I thought I would upgrade to the blu-ray format, but was concerned that it wouldn't be worth the extra money. Let me tell you, I was not disappointed. The blu-ray edition is vastly superior both visually and musically. I've found that quite often there's really no significant difference between the standard and blu-ray versions. But with a film this aethetically dynamic, I was stunned by the improvement in quality.     Overall, whether you're a Jane Austen devotee or you simply enjoy this film, go with the blu-ray version. No contest.

B0037A4ILC|5.0|I have a fear of heights.<br /><br />I also have a new fear of being stranded on the side of a sheer cliff called \\"The Murder Wall\\" during a blizzard.  This unexpected thriller, based on a true story, held me spellbound for it's just over two hour running time.  I can't recall a more harrowing mountain adventure.<br /><br />This riveting recreation is set in 1936, a short time before the famed (and notorious) Berlin Olympics which Hitler hoped to use as propaganda to tout the superiority of all things Nazi and Aryan.  The worldwide news of Germans conquering this impossible, peak was a hoped-for event before the Olympics and something encouraged by the German press.  Here two Germans -- Toni Kurz and Andreas Hinterstoisser -- confront \\"the last problem of the Alps\\": the Eiger's unclimbed North Face.  They are closely followed up \\"The Murder Wall\\" by a competing Austrian team.  But things go terribly wrong.  The crowds and the press watch the ensuing, heart-stopping drama through telescopes from the inn and chalets below.<br /><br /> A terrible point of no return is reached.  Under unimaginable conditions, the men fight for survival, trying to do what's right when everything's gone wrong.  This extraordinary drama does not relent.  It held me in a freezing visceral grip.  I was on the mountain with these men and never once felt that it was anything less than real.  If you have a need to climb the Eiger, please make note of the Hinterstoisser Traverse.  Director Philipp Stoelzl superbly captures the dangers, the daring and the tragedy.

This singer is like a chameleon, she goes from a ballad to a techno-dance song with an ease that would amaze anyone with an open mind for modern music.  The lyrics of some songs are irreverent and fantastic (not suitable for children under 15 BTW) and the rythm is so catchy you'll find yourself repeating them over and over.  Somebody said that the best artists are the crazier ones and with Gaga they sure were right: she's great!

B002ZRPQ5K|5.0|I first heard Keane through a spot on a CW teen show, and I was astonished at the piano-driven rock melody. So I purchased HOPES AND FEARS on a whim, not knowing that it wouldn't leave my CD player for months. Of course, the sound has expanded and evolved in ways I never imagined. Keane has found ways to make music that I never knew possible--from the darker, heavily synthesized UNDER THE IRON SEA to the 80s-themed PERFECT SYMMETRY, Keane brings complexity to the alt-rock scene.     Is NIGHT TRAIN their best? Perhaps not. But for those who complain that this isn't the \\"Keane sound,\\" I think they're really missing out. The collaborations with K'Naan and Tigarah are innovative, original, and (I think) quite exciting. It shows a willingness to branch out and experiment. I'd especially recommend \\"Stop for a Minute\\" and \\"Your Love\\" (Tim's vocals are soaring and beautiful).
B002G1YPH0|5.0|Great heat sink. Option to add one more fan is great.  Only gripe I have is cumbersome install.  Need to remove the motherboard in order to install the back plate.  Also need to watch out if you have one of the crazy memory heat sink.  You may be limited to which side of the heat sink you can install the fan.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This DVD has gotten me in great shape, and in less then a months time. She's very motivating, and the different levels make for a great upgrade to your workout routine. A++
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|How can you go wrong with the talent of these two. You will sit back and feel your own situations in every lyric, every song, some kind of way. Most of the production was done by Damian Marley who's musical talent is beyond amazing and amazingly Nas' lyrical talent keeps up on every song. I was worried that the two wouldn't mix well like Jay-Z and R. Kelly's collaboration but boy was I wrong!!! BUY this album, proceeds are also going to Africa, that's how real these brotha's made this project....  Instant classic that I will be playing for years.....
B0039TD7RC|5.0|Not that this album needs anymore attention than it has already recieved in the past, but the remastering of Exile on Main St. certainly breathes new life into this old classic. Plus, it exposes a whole new generation (or two) to one of the greatest rock n' roll albums, and certainly one of the greatest bands, of all time. This album jumps out higher than it ever did before, the riffs spark, the horns tickle your ears, and the drums snap and rumble your body like a midsummer thunderstorm. This album was always a good listen, but it's an even livelier listen yet. It's remastering begs to be cranked in your car or home stereo, and doesn't lose it's production value with each crank to the right. Blare this puppy, loud!!!
0307454541|5.0|When there are over 1,100 reviews there are little to be added.  I love mysteries and this is a good one.  I especially enjoyed learning about Sweden.  One can find nits in any book but I recommend just relax and spend several hours having fun.
6305212112|3.0|Good movie to see w/ the family at night. About 2 hours long- but a good movie after all.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|Genius is how I describe this CD. I am a huge Damian Marley fan and have been waiting for another cd to drop since his last Welcome to Jamrock. When I found out long ago that his next CD would be a collabo with Nas I was a little disapointed only because I wanted a pure Damian CD.  With that being said I had heard a few of the songs from the cd that were leaked/released over the last few months and qas very happy with what i heard and the sound Nas brought to my fav artist Damian. I loved the original callabo \\"Road to Zion\\" and figured that the new CD would fall along those lines. What I did not expect was how much I would love this CD and how it would excdeed my highest expectation. I think the two of them together created quite an inspring and uplifting sound! Pure genious! If you like uplifing, positive, real music with a message then you will love this CD!   Every song is better than the next and every track is blazing fyah! These two are very talented and together they made an amazing cd.    I hope this CD gets the recognition due for it's greatness! Job well done and can't wait to see these two live in two weeks!
B001DDBCUA|5.0|My wife loves Sex and the City.  She has watched this movie at least 5 times since she got it.  The quality is great and the prices was reasonable.  It's a good buy!
B003CIG7AE|4.0|I have a feeling this ablum is as good as the others. However, I can barely recognize Bridwell's voice, which was one of things I liked most about this band. It's just WAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAY overproduced. Why do bands go into studios and allow themselves to be butchered by some narcissistic producer? My only hope is all the digital crap will be stripped away when I see them live next month. I still like the music. I can hear Band of Horses buried under all that shiny crap.
B0011UBDTK|2.0|I bought this for my wife and another one for her friend on her birthday because they are Sex And The City junkies.  As noted by other reviews, the quality of the DVD's are not that great.  In both packages that we received some of the individuals shows don't play.  Our experience is that the episodes skip from time to time.  We tried them on two DVD players and two notebook computers with the same response.  You will get most of the shows to play but it is hit or miss.  We didn't bother sending them back since we expected to get the same quality in exchange.  If you have the money, buy each season individually and you won't have any problems.
0385504225|5.0|THE LOST SYMBOL by Dan Brown is a much better book than the DA VINCI CODE though it does lag a bit in places with its pacing. Now at this time in our history it is worthy of a much closer reading for the information about the symbols of our county and brush aside the puzzle-mystery aspects.<br />Brown writes about real places and real symbols, which each American should study and consider their significance as OUR values are under attack from all sides including the History Channel, which manages to play to the sensational instead of the truth without delivering in either category.<br />Nash Black, author of Indie finalists WRITING AS A SMALL BUSINESS and HAINTS.
B00382S9N2|5.0|The Keepsake Edition comes packaged in a cardboard package that measures approx. 8\\" tall and 2\\" deep. It may pose a problem for storage for some. This is easily remedied by tossing the outer packaging and keeping the enclosed reg. size dvd (cardboard) case and extra keepsake book.  As for the content- Enclosed is the blu ray movie plus digital copy, A keepsake hardcover book written by Eleanor Bergstein(writer and coproducer of the movie). A Fifty dollar off coupon for the Mountain Lake Hotel( where most of the movie was filmed).   The Bluray looked great on my sony LCD, the audio sounded fantastic on my Onkyo 7.1. I loved the extra features included on the bluray! There was a feature on the filming locations of the movie (Kellarman's Reliving the Locations), Tear jerking tributes to Swayze, Ardolino,Orbach, Behind the scene commentaries, Music videos, cast interviews, etc.  The list goes on and on!   The keepsake book- includes bios of the main characters and what they have been up to since filming dirty dancing. Lots of movie photos as well.   Overall- I am happy with my purchase. I think for those that already own Dirty Dancing on dvd- this is a must have for the blu ray  picture, audio and extra content.

B002JCSWV6|5.0|I had little idea of Mandela before this movie. I heard of the person frequently and knew that many international celebrities are proud of their association with him. Now I understand why. This man is great, not only for his being jailed for 20+ years against apartheid, but for his character, like a saint, that he not only forgives his enemies for the benefits of his country, but with great wisdom, he unites them. Many reviewers express their frustration when they view it as a sports movie or compare it with the director's previous work. Luckily enough somebody had told me that this is a movie about Mandela and so I could watch it as what it intended to be. Inspirational and motivational! Yet quite entertaining. In short, highly recommended!<br /><br />Remarks:<br /><br />1. This is the first Clint Eastwoord directed movie I ever saw. Nevertheless, I am sure he is a great director in that he had not made any violent scene at all yet I can still feel the stress of a post apartheid South Africa.<br /><br />2. For your easy reference, below please find the poem that helped Mandela. Hope it can help us as well.<br /><br />Out of the night that covers me,<br />Black as the pit from pole to pole,<br />I thank whatever gods may be<br />For my unconquerable soul.<br /><br />In the fell clutch of circumstance<br />I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br />Under the bludgeonings of chance<br />My head is bloody, but unbowed.<br /><br />Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br />Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br />And yet the menace of the years<br />Finds and shall find me unafraid.<br /><br />It matters not how strait the gate,<br />How charged with punishments the scroll,<br />I am the master of my fate:<br />I am the captain of my soul.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|As a former Marine this is about as real as it can get on movies. It is riveting lacking only the true fear of yourself actually being the target. Many that were in actual combat contributed to and were in such emotional circumstances that that they couldn't talk about their experiences but kept them locked inside their souls. Some times when these experiences were released they exploded. Pacific has captured this emotion although it will be disturbing for some to watch.I think Steven Spielberg and Tom Hanks are to congratulated for showing that in a period of history common men and women never felt \\"they deserved\\" from their country but were willing to give all.

B00009W0U4|1.0|First, I got dizzy from watching it at the beginning which is unusual since I loved The Blair Witch Project and it did not make me dizzy.  As for chronological or rather nonchronolgical filmaking, I'm used to that, too.  As for violence I'm used to that.    But this film was so gratuitous, it ranks on the level of 8mm for shock value.  I saw no redeeming value in this and stopped when Monica was seen taken in the ambulance after being raped.  (Why did a prostitute tell Alex to take the underpass as being safer (than the street?  That didn't make sense to me.  And how many times can one use the word rec**m so many times?  The foul language and beatings were really gratuitous and could have used a lot of editing.  It was shock value for shock effect only.    And I'm not a prude.

B001UV4XUG|3.0|Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a twenty-something greeting card writer, recalls the 500 days in which he loved a girl named Summer (Zooey Deschanel).  Though she made it clear she was a free spirit and didn't want a boyfriend, the two coworkers became involved and then parted, reunited briefly to be parted again.<br /><br />This much talked-about romantic dramedy is fairly lightweight stuff, aimed at the teen and early-twenties set.  To my older eyes, it seemed a bit of fluff, a forgettable reverie, some bittersweet moments on the way to growing up.  The episodic movie flashes backward and forward to individual \\"days\\" with each scene lasting only a minute or two; it soon became clear there wouldn't be time to develop deep feelings and each vignette felt cursory and sometimes even corny.  Although Gordon-Levitt and Deschanel are both appealing, there was no chemistry between them and no connection with me as a viewer.<br /><br />I suppose it's pleasant enough if you like lovesick boy meets girl-type flicks, but it just wasn't engaging enough for me.
B000C20VRS|5.0|Was very happy with order. Received it very quickly, in good condition. Will definitely order this person's products in the future
0385339089|4.0|NOt much as far as actuality goes and it does indeed take on mythic proportions sometimes but as far as readibility this does keep you going and making villians out of the fbi, well they weren't acutally they just did things wrong. The woman lawyer is a bit overdone and there is a host of characters that come and go. The prose easily pokes fun at some of the idiot characters and that in of itself almost is idiot itself. It was a bit outlandish I'll give it that and it was almost entirley made up. The mother was right, had the kid told the truth outright the book would have never happened. Maybe the kid shoulda just come out and said what happened instead of his imigination runnig wild with him. It did get a little out there sometimes and movie ish. OVerall a good book for a quick read but don't expect massive poetry or deep insight. Not much of that there.
B002ZRPQ5K|4.0|I'm just happy that these guys exist. They just never fail to bring great songs. This EP is really distant from Hopes and Fears, but has some very surprising and pleasant stuff.    Back in time is very good, fitting for a first track, a powerful one. Stop for a Minute is great, Clear Skies is my favourite (for now), and Looking Back is also fantastic. My shadow is the typical \\"Keane Song\\", although this term will soon become useless because they are so eclectic.    Just hope they keep up the good work ... and do whatever they want, because they are great in so many styles.
1400052173|4.0|As I write this, I am the 210th reviewer, so I'll spare you the plot. I will say that the author gave herself several assignments:    Bring Henrietta Lacks to life as a person, not just the unwitting contributor to scientific research    Frame HeLa cells so that the non-scientist will understand, and the scientist will not get ticked off    Show that the family was hurt by the harvest of HeLa cells, and that they deserve monetary compensation for all the cells continue to do    Show the story of the author's (good lord!) ten years of research    Henrietta was a tragic figure with or without HeLa cells. Her inbred, uneducated family was in crisis before even she was born.  While the author tells a good story about her life, anybody's life, well-told, is interesting.  Because she would lose cooperation if she criticized them, Skloot had to tread with care. So there's not a whisper of anger about Day (her 19 year old cousin) impregnating 14-year-old Henrietta, giving her multiple STDs, or the violence in the family (some of it even from Henrietta). Did Day rape her? While the law may have been different long ago, there is no state in the US where the age of consent is as young as 14, and age differences between partners affect the seriousness of the crime. (Similarly, the fact that \\"stalking\\" didn't even have a definition until recently did not make it ethically right before there was a law against it.) Day was 5 years older than Henrietta.. In addition, it later was part of her medical record that Henrietta disliked sex. Yes, Day raped his cousin.    The author's doggedness in her research is impressive, and the trust she engenders is, as well. Even if not a penny of the book comes to the family, Skloot has done them a favor by giving answers they not only would not have found, but would not think to ask.     Skloot succeeds unevenly.  I'm just not convinced the family is entitled to anything. Do Jenner's descendents get money from people who didn't die of smallpox? Or from those who sold smallpox vaccinations? And Jenner was even aware of what he was doing. The Lacks family had no knowledge and very little interest in the good HeLa cells could do, even toward the end seemingly more interested in whether Henrietta could be thought of as immortal because of the cells than in the difference they could make.    But it's a good story. You care about the family by the end. And the science is well-told. A good book that makes me think.
B003CIG7AE|5.0|Band Of Horses are a US roots Rock quintet (for now at least as they seem to shed members every so often) and \\"Infinite Arms\\" is their third album.<br /><br />Opening the album is \\"Factory\\", a beautiful slow burning ballad, followed by the extremely catchy stomping \\"Compliments\\" awash in rushing guitars.<br /><br />There appears to be a lack of urgency and almost everything is midtempo paced with other standouts being the ballad \\"Blue beard\\" (with sixties-style harmonies), the tender acoustic title track, the soothing \\"Evening kitchen\\", the Country-tinged \\"Older\\" (with pedal steel guitar), and picking up speed are the pulsing \\"Dilly\\" and \\"Northwest apartment\\".<br /><br />Closing is \\"Neighbour\\" which starts off sombre with quivering guitars, building to a crashing guitar/organ crescendo.
0141301066|4.0|By Roald Dahl standards, this is a fairly \\"normal\\" book.  That's not to say it's dull or predictable, it's just that it doesn't have any giants, enormous peaches, fantastical chocolate factories, or any of the other wild elements in Dahl's books.    What this book does have is a likable little girl (Matilda), her caring teacher, her uncaring parents and, especially, Miss Trunchbull.     Miss Trunchbull is the over-the-top evil headmistress of Matilda's school and you just love to hate her. There's no shades of gray here. Miss Trunchbull punishes students by locking them in a dark closet lined with broken glass.  She throws students over fences. She screams relentlessly at them:  \\"You festering gumbol! You fleabitten fungus!\\"     I read this book to my 7-year-old son, and my 9-year-old daughter read ahead on her own at about the same time. We all enjoyed it.  It's a nice story, with  enough surprises to keep us going.      I think kids - girls especially - can relate well to Matilda.  While some parents might not like that Matilda plays tricks on her mother and father (even if they deserve it), the book has the admirable message that reading is good.  And my kids certainly appreciate their school principal more after reading about Miss Trunchbull.
B003AO1SVS|5.0|I got into the music of Blues Rock duo The Black Keys via their Danger Mouse-produced album \\"Attack & release\\". I also loved their Hip Hop collaborative venture Blakroc.<br /><br />This time around, Danger Mouse produced just one track, the groovy organ-sprinkled tempo-shifting \\"Tighten up\\". Everything else was produced by the pair.<br /><br />I love the sonic diversity among the songs, from the fuzzy falsetto-sung \\"Everlasting light\\", the funky Blues \\"Next girl\\" (very White Stripes), the psychedelic pair of \\"She's long gone\\" and falsetto-sung \\"The only one\\", the quivering guitar instrumental \\"Black mud\\", the absolutely beautiful harpsichord ballad \\"Too afraid to love you\\", the simmering ballad \\"I'm not the one\\", and the Sixties Soul-channeling pair of \\"Unknown brother\\" and \\"Never give you up\\" (the latter a Jerry Butler cover).<br /><br />What an absolutely fabulous album this is. To those that think there is hardly any good music being made these days, you just need to switch off from top 40 radio and TV and discover gems like this.
B000FP2OPY|5.0|This show is the best show about the \\"Supernatural\\" since Buffy the Vampire Slayer. And as a fan of Buffy I can say that if you loved the way Buffy could scare you and make you laugh at the same time you will love the Winchester brothers style of hunting.      This show is about two brothers Sam and Dean that go off looking for thier Dad after he goes missing while hunting the demon that killed their Mom when the boys were still small. Dean is the older brother and really likes what he does. He is the brother that is ready to take chances and makes snap decisions. Sam is the younger brother and really has seperated himself from the \\"Supernatural\\" world and has gone to college. He is the brother that is really trying to fight his destiny, he doesn't want to be a hunter he just wants to be a normal guy.      The show really trusts the audience to think for themselves which not many shows do today. They don't push the answers on you they let you come to them on your own. You learn things as Sam and Dean do. And let me say that these boys are good at their jobs! And when I say that I mean that you are going to get amazing fight scenes and chilling demons. Normally these shows don't scare me but Supernatural has made me check my closet before I go to bed a few times!     While this show is amazing and really takes your attention I don't think I would call it a \\"family\\" show. Dean and Sam do a good bit of cusing and as I have said the monsters will give smaller children nightmares. But just like Buffy you will be quoting this show after watching.       I would recomend this show to anyone. You will enjoy it I know I have enjoyed many a trip with Sam and Dean in their Impala.
B003GDYN24|5.0|Kelis' new CD \\"Flesh Tone\\" comprises 9 tracks of Eurodisco. Working with producers like David Guetta, Benny Benassi and will.i.am, it reminds one of Donna Summer's non-stop seventies Disco classics. A number of the songs intertwine with the next, with some having codas distinctively different from the main song. No skeletal Neptunes Funk (\\"Milkshake\\") or Cee-Lo penned Pop (\\"Lil star\\") here.<br /><br />The midtempo \\"Intro\\", despite its name, is a proper song with swirling synths with Kelis singing in that straining-to-reach-the-notes voice she does with such ease. This segues into the propulsive \\"22nd century\\" with surging synths, electronic swishes and flourishes, gently stomping beats that come in fully after the first chorus and her vocals mechanically tweaked to lend it a futuristic bent. It ends in a piano coda that segues into \\"4th July (Fireworks)\\" which has a jittery Techno feel.<br /><br />\\"We are all running in a race, to find everything that you're searching for is right there\\" she tells us in the Trancey \\"Home\\" that does itself feel like a race. Lead-off single, a UK #5 hit is the semi-skeletal Guetta-produced \\"Acapella\\" with staccato beats and lovely harmonies, segueing into the piano-sprinkled Guetta-produced \\"Scream\\" with spoken/chanted verses.<br /><br />\\"Emancipate\\" is one of the grooviest songs and should appeal to fans of her prior R&B sound, as should the beautiful celebratory horn-peppered \\"Song for the baby\\" sounding like eighties Soul set to a Disco beat, an ode to her son Knight. \\"Brave\\" features buzzing synths and light vocoder effects, a stomping Club anthem with biographical lyrics.<br /><br />A brave change in direction for Kelis which should be a big hit in Europe. Kelis said she wants this album to make the listener sweat, and with music this hot, you will.

B0039ZF8D2|5.0|\\"Distant relatives\\" is a collaborative effort by Rapper Nas and Reggae singer Damian Marley (Bob Marley's son). Recorded with a live band, it's a Reggae/Hip hop hybrid which works rather well. Both had previously collaborated on the track \\"Road to Zion\\" from Marley's album \\"Welcome to Jamrock\\", and from thence came the idea for this. Most of the lyrics revolve about Africa (poverty, AIDS, the diamond trade without sounding corny or heavy handed) and proceeds will go towards building a school in an African country.<br /><br />\\"Tribes at war\\" has African percussion, Arabic strings and a cameo from K'Naan. \\"Everyone deserves to earn, every child deserves to learn\\" sings Marley in his world weary delivery while K'Naan asks \\"I drink poison then vomit diamonds, I gave you Mandela, Black Dalai Lamas, I gave you music, you enthused in my kindness, so how dare you reduce me to Donny Imus?\\". Damien had previously appeared on the track \\"I come prepared\\" from K'Naan's album \\"Troubadour\\".<br /><br />\\"Strong will continue\\" has a marching beat and electric guitars (with some semi-biographical rapping from Nas touching on his ex and alimony payments) while the beautiful and lilting \\"Leaders\\" features Damian's brother Stephen. It sounds like a Bob Marley classic.<br /><br />\\"Count your blessings\\" is a gently stomping horn-peppered number finding Marley thankful for love and assurance, new health insurance, strength and endurance, and urging us to do the same, while \\"Land of promise\\" is a cover of a song by Dennis Brown featuring the Reggae legend himself. It is a slow burning Dub with lyrics seeing a new Africa with Ethiopia the capital.<br /><br />\\"In his own words\\" features lovely jangly guitars, hand claps, a choir, and Stephen Marley again, and \\"Patience\\" is a beautiful ballad with a mournful lament for a chorus.<br /><br />\\"My generation\\" has a children's choir singing \\"My generation will make a change\\" with Joss Stone complementing the choir and Lil Wayne dropping a few verses  telling us \\"This generation I'm a represent, a generation led by a black president... So when you finish reading Revelations, thank God for my generation\\". Stone repays a favour as Nas appeared on the track \\"Governmentalist\\" on her \\"Colour me free\\" album.<br /><br />Closing is the almost seven minute long \\"Africa must wake up\\", a lush string-swathed slow burning Dub with another appearance from K'Naan and a great guitar solo. The lyrics teach us Africa is a land that gave the world the first architect, philosophers, astronomers, prophets, doctors, and from where all the world's religions originated. This is my favourite song.<br /><br />Production is largely handled by Damian whose talent Nas compared to Quincy Jones. As beautiful and moving as the music is, the lyrics are even deeper and educative. \\"We're all distant relatives, no matter where you're from, where you live, how near how far, Africa, China, Japan, Afghanistan, Israel, we're all family\\" to quote Nas from \\"Africa must wake up\\".represent, a generation led by a black president...

B002VPE1AW|5.0|This movie was AMAZING!  It was less a movie and more an experience of another world brought to life through an engaging, epic story that any viewer would enjoy.  Need to see in high def to understand just what James Cameron hath wrought.  Excellent acting, wonderful, moving score, witty dialogue, beautiful scenery, epic battle, and emotion galore.  I've never seen an entire theatre get so teary over a tree before.  The epitome of what a geek, nerd, or Sci-fi buff wants in a movie, is actually enjoyed by viewers off all ages with all interests.  MUST SEE!
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Surely no human could possibly create such amazing genre-hopping music as this, it could only be an android. And so it is we find Janelle Mon&aacute;e inspired by 1927 sci-fi movie \\"Metropolis\\" creates a cyber soul persona Cindy Mayweather and the result is \\"ArchAndroid...\\", a strong contender for album of the year.<br /><br />The lyrics touch on love, war, and slavery, while the sounds range from Classical; the dramatic suite overtures, Indie; \\"Come alive (The war of the roses)\\", trippy Rock; the psychedelic Hendrix-channeling \\"Mushrooms & roses\\" with distorted vocodered vocals, Pop; the bouncy Motown-esque  \\"Faster\\", \\"Cold war\\" (on which she sounds like Beyonc&eacute;, but without the over-reaching she is prone to), and retro Soul; \\"Locked inside\\", the Stevie Wonder-esque \\"Oh, Maker\\", the lush Lauryn Hill-esque \\"Neon valley street\\" with a lovely guitar solo, while \\"Neon gumbo\\" is the sound of a song playing backwards.<br /><br />\\"Dance or die\\" features Saul Williams and a spitfire delivery from Mon&aacute;e, groovy baseline, and an Afro beat feel. Lead-off single \\"Tightrope\\" is retro Funk featuring Outkast's Big Boi and \\"the funkiest horn section in Metropolis\\", sounding like something from Outkast's \\"Idlewild\\" album (on which she appeared). Punk Rock group Of Montreal feature on the quirky alt Pop \\"Make the bus\\", \\"Wondaland\\" is midtempo and incredibly catchy, while the dreamy acoustic ballad \\"57821\\" features Deep Cotton and sounds folky and hymnal, like The Fleet Foxes.<br /><br />The woozy \\"Sir Greendown\\"is an enchanting ballad, the breezy ballad \\"Say you'll go\\" reminds me of Stevie Wonder's \\"Rocket love\\" in places, while closing is the lush Jazzy \\"BaBooByeYa\\" which meanders through different movements, a mini opera sounding like something Shirley Bassey would do.<br /><br />Mon&aacute;e is supremely talented and she has created a theatrical masterpiece here, sounding at times like a musical. As this is the second in a three part series (the first part \\"Metropolis: The chase suite\\" was nominated for a Grammy for the bouncy \\"Many moons\\"), it would be interesting to see where this leads. Highly recommended!the bouncy \\"Many moons\\"), it would be interesting to see where this leads. Highly recommended!
1569242739|5.0|I am a vegan teenage girl, and I have made many of these recipes for my meat and cheese loving friends and I have had great results. The first ones I made were the Oreo cupcakes, made with Whole Foods organic oreos, of course. Everyone loved them. In fact, I was not even able to sample one as everyone at the party scooped them up and went back for seconds before I could get over to the dessert table! I also made the plain vanilla ones a couple times, and they have always been well received. I made my non-vegan dad the peanut butter cupcakes for his birthday (tip: they taste great with a slice of fresh strawberry on top) and he LOVED them. He even requested I make them for one of his office parties! I have not made all of the recipes in this book, but all the ones I have made so far have been 10 stars out of 5, even with the omnis!
B002VPE7AQ|5.0|Everyone's heard of of the forbidden love between Romeo & Juliet and in the modern and urban twist, the two main characters are paired up in chemistry class.<br /><br />First off, I absolutely loved how Simone Elkeles alternates between Alex's POV and Brittany's POV. Sometimes I might get annoyed at alternating chapters (I used to dislike books like that!) but I think it makes this book even better. Brittany is captain of cheerleading and to everyone, she is viewed as perfect, however that is not the case. Alex is in a gang but there is more to him than meets the eye, whose POV I especially liked reading.<br /><br />I didn't think I would enjoy this book as much as I did but luckily I was wrong! This has been one of my favorites books I've read this year (not that I've read a lot..will get on that!) because there were just so many things I loved about it! The writing, the romance, the forced partnership (LOVE THAT IN BOOKS!) and I haven't read a lot of books that deal with gangs and I thought it was a interesting change from the other books I read.<br /><br />Epilogue = Win!
B0035WTE2U|3.0|I love AC/DC, so I'm not going to knock this compilation, but the whole Iron Man 2 tie-in is terribly misleading. It's the only reason I went to see the movie, and was extremely disappointed to hear only 2 of their songs in the movie. Fortunately the movie was good, so I don't feel too manipulated. Of course, had the movie actually been full of these songs, it would have been better, but that's my opinion. I'm happy to see the band get the attention, but I wonder if they are actually even in on this one. Honestly, this should have been distributed as a \\"best of\\" release, not a ploy to get AC/DC fans into the movie theatre.     BTW: the movie mistakenly credits Highway To Hell to Young, Young, and Johnson, and not Bon Scott. Aren't they supposed to edit these things before release, and if they were such big AC/DC fans, how could they muff THAT up? Everyone knows the story, don't they. RIP, Bon!
0142414999|4.0|Make yourself a nice cup of hot cocoa and get a warm blanket and then, prepare yourself for a nice holiday story.<br /><br />Since it's the holidays, I really wanted to read some kind of Christmas-y book. So, I texted my friend/swimming buddy and asked to borrow this book. I'm so glad that I got to read this one. It is written by some pretty amazing authors: Maureen Johnson, John Green and Lauren Myracle and each their stories are unique and different.<br /><br />The first part of the book, The Jubilee Express, Maureen Johnson's part of the book sets up the story for the book. We meet Jubilee, who is named after a piece from the Flobie Santa Village -a series of collectable ceramic holiday pieces. After her parents get thrown in jail, which had to do with those same Flobie pieces, Jubilee takes a train to go to her grandparents for Christmas and she hates that she has to leave her boyfriend behind. The train gets delayed in Gracetown because of the blizzard. She meets a guy named Jeb, who has relationship problems of his own and on the train there are a bunch of cheerleaders which Jubilee can not stand so she heads to The Waffle House. From there thats when the story really takes off. She meets a guy and over the next 24 hours or so, she makes some decisions regarding her boyfriend. The ending was cute!<br /><br />My favorite story to read was the second part of the book. A Cheertastic Christmas is John Green's part of the book and it is incredibly funny! Tobin, JP, and the Duke (Angie) are enjoying a James Bond movie marathon until they get a call from their friend telling them to come to The Waffle House. The guys are all for it, as there are bunch of cheerleaders stuck there for the night and the Duke tags along as well. Due to the fact that there happened to be a blizzard outside, it took a little longer than expected. I absolutely loved reading about their adventure. It was a bit predictable with what was going to happen with the characters, but I enjoyed it a lot.<br /><br />I was quite surprised by the last story in the book, The Patron Saints of Pigs, which is written by Lauren Myracle. Addie feels that her boyfriend Jeb is great and all, but doesn't pay her enough attention and wants him to change. Then, one night at a party, Addie finds herself kissing another guy and immediately regrets it. Jeb and her sort of go through a breakup and Addie tries to find away to get him back. I loved that this story was about Addie realizing that she needed to change her ways and stop being so self-absorbed. Addie works at Starbucks and one of her regular costumers helps her out unexpectedly and Addie is able to stop thinking only of herself.<br /><br />I loved how all the stories came together. I thought that was pretty clever. It was really interesting seeing the POV from the main character from each story and seeing them interact with the characters from the other stories. I expected the romances to be fluffy and cutesy. However, all 3 of the romances are realistic as the couples go through breakups and a lot of other things.rised by the last story in the book, The Patron Saints of Pigs, which is written by Lauren Myracle.

0316044938|5.0|I don't usually read this type of book, and only chose to do so when I saw the previews to the motion picture and liked the concept.  I have to say it was pretty impressive.  Like the textbook novel, it begins with a \\"grab your attention\\" introduction that rivals Shirley Jackson's [[ASIN:0143039970 We Have Always Lived in the Castle (Penguin Classics Deluxe Edition)]].  There, at the end of a paragraph detailing some of her unusual traits, the narrator states simply, \\"Everyone else in my family is dead,\\" and you're irrevocably hooked.  So too with Ms Sebold's Suzy Salmon.  Both books project macabre elements against a background of the apparently \\"normal\\" in life.  The book also reminds me a little of[[ASIN:0786868716 The Five People You Meet in Heaven]] by Mitch Albom, which itself has a very metaphysical aura.  Both books seem to attempt to relate unpleasant events that happen during a person's lifetime to a meaning that transcends mere physical existence.  Like the play [[ASIN:B0009LIGJC Our Town : A Play in Three Acts (Perennial Classics)]] by Thornton Wilder, the book also takes small and seemingly unimportant objects or events in the lives of the characters and shows how truly significant and meaningful they are, while also revealing for the reader how much that's important of our own lives we actually miss.  Like this play, Lovely Bones, reveals that once we or our loved ones are gone, there's no going back again.  When Suzy tells you she's dead and details her murder, as only the murdered person could, it immediately occurs to the reader that if the ghost of Suzy can talk about the brutality of her own death, she might well be able to avenge it as well.  But this is not about vengence; it's about acceptance and growth, which makes it much more than a Charles Bronson nail-the-bad-guys story.<br /><br />An incredible book.

How can this product please one person so completely and another not at all? It's very confusing.

B00003CXBK|5.0|Director Hayao Miyazaki, picks his projects very selectively, only choosing things he finds worth viewing. This anime has every story line angle that could possible be out there.... Man vs. Man; Man vs. Machine, Man vs. Nature, Man vs. Himself, Man vs. Woman, Man vs. Society; Man vs. Greed/ Power. What a well rounded told story for a cartoon anime. The underlining moral of the story addresses the struggles in our daily lives to just get along and find a happy balance within ourself, nature and other man kind. This is an epic fantasy that everyone should see; we might learn something from it. A classic to have in your collection. Lots of action to keep anyone inthralled. Wonderful storytelling. Beautiful colors and art work.
0385341008|5.0|In starting off this review, I think it's safe to assume that many of you out there are book lovers. Bibliophiles. Bookworms. Readers. So my lovely readers, what is the one thing all book addicts adore more than anything (other than free books) when reading a book for the first time? Well, at least in this readers case, it would be cracking open a book only to discover it is all about other people discovering and loving books too. le sigh. It's like meeting another kindred spirit, only in book form, who too understands just exactly how paper and ink can be turned into something breathtakingly profound.<br /><br />The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a witty and ever-so-charming epistolary novel set just after the end of World War II in London. Juliet Ashton, a successful young novelist, has just finished an exhausting book tour for her publisher (and dear friend) Sidney Stark when she receives a letter from a farmer/fisherman from the Channel Island of Guernsey asking for book recommendations for his literary society. Currently between book ideas, Juliet is intrigued by this simple request and eagerly continues her correspondence with the fisherman and other Guernsey Literary Society members. What she receives are countless letters detailing individual accounts of life during the German Occupation of their small island - some hilarious, some heartbreaking, and others simply charming. Above all, Juliet receives a collection of letters explaining how and why these average working men and women fell in love with books and became true readers.<br /><br />Of course all these honest and witty letters and telegrams lead Juliet to make the voyage to Guernsey herself where she finds herself falling in love with not only the people but the island itself. As she states in a letter to Sidney: \\"Quite apart from my interest in their interest in reading, I have fallen in love with two men: Eben Ramsey and Dawsey Adams. Clovis Fossey and John Booker, I like. I want Amelia Maugery to adopt me; and me, I want to adopt Isola Pribby.\\" And let me continue with Juliet's thoughts by adding: Juliet Ashton and Sidney Stark, I want to have as pen pals and Kit, I want to play \\"dead bride\\" with.<br /><br />If you, like me, are one of the very few people yet to read this surprising little book, please do yourself a favor and do so at once. I have no idea why I let it languish on my bookshelf for months on end, but I am just kicking myself for not diving in sooner, because it is absolutely wonderful. History, love, humor, trials, and of course, books. A must-read for any bibliophile.to adopt me; and me, I want to adopt Isola Pribby.\\" And let me continue with Juliet's thoughts by adding: Juliet Ashton and Sidney Stark, I want to have as pen pals and Kit, I want to play \\"dead bride\\" with.

0141192453|5.0|This book is a hard-cover book with an unusual design on all sides of the cover. It has a nice face page followed by the Table of Contents which is well set up, followed by an Introduction which gives a good history of Robert Louis Stevenson. Although the book was originally written more for boys, several of my friends and I enjoyed the book in our pre-teen years. There is also a page of \\"Suggestions for Further Reading.\\" The book is broken up into six areas each with three to seven parts. Pre-teens and teens may find the book interesting as it contains mystery and much adventure which takes place back in the days of large sailing ships and pirates. There is an APPENDIX A: 'MY FIRST BOOK\\" (1894) and   APPENDIX B: TALES OF A TRAVELLER at the end of the book.     Adults who like adventure stories might enjoy this book as well.
B002ECJZ76|4.0|Not to be confused with the classic American film \\"A Christmas Story,\\" this \\"Christmas Story\\" is a Finnish film with English audio dubs on this DVD. The English dubs are not done very well, and it would've been nice to instead have the unaltered Finnish film presented with English subtitles. Even still, bad dubs aren't enough to detract too much from the overall quality of this excellent holiday film. I watched this with my wife and kids and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. The acting is superb, and the story itself excels on all levels. If you're looking to watch something different with the family this Christmas, I would definitely recommend giving this film a chance.
0345347951|2.0|First, I'll issue a warning: there will be some spoilers in this review. You've been warned.    Now, I've been eying this book for some time. It is small, so it doesn't take too much of your time hostage(in comparison to, say, a 900-page epic). It is one of the most famous works of science fiction ever written. Moreover, I'd been wanting to read something by its author, Arthur C. Clarke, for awhile now. I'd read a few short stories written by him, but nothing of any great significance. So this was the perfect place for me to start on my literary journey with Mr. Clarke.    Or so I thought.    I can't imagine that a writer as famous as Clarke could produce more than one novel as bad as this. And this is one of his early works, anyhow. So I'll give him another chance... someday.    But this novel has really put me off Clarke, because this novel is really, really bad.    There are about a million little criticisms I could make of this book, but I'll only list the major ones:    Lack of Content: This book is a little less than 230 pages long, and yet Clarke struggles to spread the material thin enough to even make it that long. There's just very little of interest here. Clarke has ideas, but he doesn't seem to be able to explore them in any depth. This book reads like a barely fleshed-out outline of what should have been included in the novel at a later date. The lack of any meaningful content is particularly noticeable in the SLLLLLLLLLLOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOWWWWW middle segment. This novel is boring and lacks significant speculation.    Horrible character development: I know Clarke isn't well-known for his memorable characters, but these people are hardly distinguishable from one-another. And no, the epic scope of the novel doesn't justify this. These people aren't people: they're interchangeable sock puppets.    Bad concepts: Apparently, evolution doesn't mean to Clarke what it means to biologists. Rather, to him, evolution is this vague ladder up the Great Chain of Being. The Overlords despair at being unable to evolve any further. WHY IS THIS A PROBLEM? They've adapted perfectly to their native environment. And even if they could evolve further, this doesn't mean they'd improve in some abstract way as a species. Clarke's evolution seems to be indistinguishable from the Nazi conception of it, wherein it'll create a breed of supermen. This is NOT how evolution works, Mr. Clarke. And besides, is there even a mechanism for it?  As if this wasn't bad enough, Clarke apparently seems to think that the next step in human evolution is--get this--toward collectivism. And I don't mean politically. The evolved human, in Clarke's view, is a heartless, soulless, glassy-eyed automaton that inevitably sheds its mortal shell and merges to become just another part of a great galactic hive mind that runs around space absorbing evolved species. Did you get that? Humanity's ultimate end is to out-borg the borg, to become an anonymous cog in a great collective machine. Charming. Clarke kills of the human race and merges the newly evolved psychic children with a relish that can only be described as revolting.  Oh, and that brings me to another point: this novel is absolutely infatuated with the occult. Apparently rationalists have it all wrong: psychic phenomena isn't a hoax, it's a sign that humanity is ready to evolve and be assimilated by the Overmind (the name given to the hive mind in this novel).  I had heard that Clarke sacrifices plot and character for concept, which in some cases could work out, but the ideas found in this novel can also be found in paranoid works of new-age \\"spirituality\\" in book-stores all over the world.    So, I gave this book two stars instead of one, so I must like something about it, right? Well, the writing is, at certain points, evocative. There is a kind of haunting beauty in the end-of-the-world as told by Clarke, and the native planetary environment of the Overlords is well-described. And I did think that the explanation given for the appearance of the Overlords and its similarity to the religious depiction of demons was very clever.    That is all the praise I can bestow upon this terrible novel. The bad definitely outweighs the good. The greatest mercy, I suppose, is that the reader doesn't have to suffer through too many pages. Then again, perhaps if Clarke had actually explored the concretes of his alien invasion story, Childhood's End would have ended up a better novel.    Two thumbs way, way down.
B00005V9HH|1.0|I am 67 years old and have seen lots of movies over the years.  I don't consider myself a \\"prude\\", but as long as movies like this one are made the public will buy them and that is a crying shame.

The only books that come close for me are Carrie Pilby (which is a similar type of character, female though, and very different book) and of course Catcher in the Rye which is an all time classic.  Read these three if you don't fit in and don't care! Or even if you do care.

B0018RWMNM|4.0|The video transfer from the film original on the blu-ray version of Lonesome Dove is very well done.  However, if you have a good audio system, you will find that the multichannel blu-ray audio suffers because it was created from the (apparently monaural) original TV sound track.  This is particularly noticeable when you contrast the sound on the main menu (apparently re-recorded in state-of-the-art stereo) with the sound track on the movie itself; high frequency response is definitely reduced and there is little channel separation.  There is some surround channel content where appropriate.  All in all, however, this is an still an outstanding movie, well worth the price on blu-ray.

B002GY9F9K|4.0|Legend of the Seeker is the show that Sam Raimi was born to make.<br /><br />I remember watching Hercules and Xena with my parents, and I liked them well enough.  There was a high cheese factor and I was never sucked into them as much as other shows, but they were fun.  I've always had a soft spot of the Evil Dead movies, with their mix of horror and goofiness.  And, of course, the action and adventure of the first Spider-man film is hard to deny.<br /><br />Legend of the Seeker takes all of those elements that Raimi is so good at directing and mixes them together in a story of high-fantasy.  If you ever watched \\"Lord of the Rings\\" and wished you could hang out in a magical world for longer than the 9 hours that all 3 movies run...well, you can now join the Seeker.<br /><br />I'll should probably mention that I have not read any of Terry Goodkind's Sword of Truth series.  I've never been able to read fantasy novels because the world building usually bores me to tears (though sometimes the movies will encourage me to read the books).  I like a lot of action and adventure and I want it NOW.  That's why Seeker is so great for me.  It has the action sequences of Hercules and Xena, the evolving plot of Spiderman and sometimes even the creepiness of Evil Dead.  Yes, sometimes it feels like half the stuff out of their mouths is \\"exposition exposition exposition\\" but I'd rather get it from episode to episode than all at once.<br /><br />Some might say it is derivative of other fantasy stories.  To that I say - what isn't?  Seriously, everything is a take on the Arthurian/Tolkien/Lucas mythos that we all know and love.  At least, the good ones.  Seeker takes the classic fantasy story of the chosen hero and the evil villian and creates a very polished story.<br /><br />For those not familiar with the specifics - Richard Cypher is a normal farm boy out in the woods and he runs into a mysterious woman in white being attacked by soldiers.  Being all noble and such, he jumps into the fight to protect her.  What he doesn't know is she doesn't need his protection - she has her own magical powers.  She is a Confessor and has the power to suck away a persons free will and make them do her bidding.  Together they escape the guards and she tells him she's looking for the Seeker.  They go to visit the crazy old man in town who turns out to be (surprise!) a Wizard!  He rescued Richard back when a prophecy said he would grow up to kill the Evil Bad Guy Darken Rahl.  Now Richard must journey back to his home land and defeat Darken Rhal with the Sword of Truth.<br /><br />See?  He's Luke!  He's Arthur!  He's wandering around like Aragorn, hanging out with a Gandalfian Wizard (complete with kooky sense of humor).<br /><br />One of the things I really like about the show is Kahlan, the female lead, played by Bridget Regan.  Kahlan, the Confessor, is a very strong character.  Yes, there is a love story involved with her and Richard, but she is more than just his girlfriend.  When she ventures off into battle, you know she can take care of herself.  Usually she is the one saving Richard or coaching him on how to be a better Seeker.  It's nice to see a non-damsel in fantasy.  I get chills when she goes into battle with her twin daggers, her gorgeous dress twirling as she jumps and stabs a guy.  Awesome.<br /><br />I don't know why Jay La'gaia is on the poster - he's only in a few episodes.  Zed, the Wizard, should be on there but I guess he wasn't pretty enough.<br /><br />I am very impressed with this show.

It's a strong series, very re-watchable, and a lot of fun.
B002BSHWUU|2.0|I'm more or less responding to a number of negative review I read.  I love the Beatles, but only own the compilation albums \\"Love\\" and \\"1\\".  I've never been too impressed with the sound quality of \\"1\\", but am admittedly taken back by the incredible remix of \\"Love\\".  \\"Love\\" though, while it is a great album, teases me with snippets of songs that I want to continue but that were not used in their entirety for whatever reason, \\"Blackbird\\" probably being the most missed.    I'd like to have their entire collection (with the best audio quality available -- particularly if I'm planning on shelling out the cash to have it).  It looks like I'll keep waiting though, since many have noted that the sound quality has been diminished with over-limiting and poorly rendered stereo mixes.  I don't mind CD quality so much, though I do hear a noticeable difference jumping between 44.1 and 88.2 or 176.  I do very much though mind having to deal with overly compressed mixes;  I have a volume knob and know how to use it, thanks.  Since something better may be a ways off, purchasing a record player and their collection on vinyl might be the alternative I take.    Cheers.
B003JSSPSY|5.0|Season 2 has been quite the ride.  After suffering from the typical \\"omg we got a second season?\\" troubles in the first few episodes, it quickly picks up the pace with new characters and a slightly more complicated plot.  The same action, adventure, and humor is there from season 1.  We get a new kick-ass female character but instead of turning this into a love triangle, the writers wisely kept the story focused on the adventure and not the romance.  A must-watch for fantasy fans.<br /><br />Don't be scared by Richard's mullet (it grows on you, really!) Season 2 is worth watching!
B0000B1OFL|3.0|Borrowing a few key elements, from the original 1969 film, the reworked version of The Italian Job (2003) is a slick, high tech affair that centers on revenge, rather than on executing an outrageously glorious theft, and bolstering national pride.<br /><br />In Venice, Italy, Charlie Croker (Mark Wahlberg) masterminds the theft of a cache of gold bars worth 35 million.  His team includes safecracker John Bridger (Donald Sutherland), driver Handsome Rob (Jason Statham), explosives expert Left Ear (Mos Def), point man Steve (Edward Norton), and electronics whiz Lyle (Seth Green). The heist goes smoothly, and the mood is celebratory, until Steve pulls a double cross, kills John Bridger, and the crew winds up trapped in an SUV, submerged under the ice of a frozen lake, dodging bullets.<br /><br />Moving forward a year, Croker discovers that Steve has surfaced in LA, going under the name of Steve Frazeli, and gathers his group together, to try and steal back the gold.  Needing a safecracker, he turns to Bridger's daughter Stella (Charlize Theron), who happens to open safes for a living.  The assembled team heads to California, to get the \\"LA Job\\" done.<br /><br />Edward Norton has a talent for playing obnoxious characters you love to hate, and the arrogant, sneering Frazeli, is the kind of vermin that deserves to be crushed like a roach.  The man does have a keen instinct for survival, and quickly moves his stash of gold, when he discovers that he is a target.  A swift closer of loose ends, he ruthlessly eliminates the Russian dealer who was exchanging his gold for cash.  With his hand forced, and the Ukrainian mafia poking around, Croker has to quickly adjust his plans, and make a completely different play.<br /><br />The original Italian Job, was about English criminal, who with the backing of the British underworld, makes a play to steal a delivery of gold from the Fiat Company in Turin, Italy.  Remarkably, few connected with the 2003 update, seemed familiar with the 1969 classic.  The newer film is not a remake, or an adaptation, it is more of mutation, grabbing a few selected strands of original DNA material, and adding some high tech elements, purely American sensibilities, and coming out with something completely different.  Prior to being commissioned to do the screenplay, the writers for the update, had also never even seen the original film.  The few key story elements that migrate to the new film include, stolen gold bars, three mini cooper automobiles, looting an armored car, and the manipulation of traffic control systems.<br /><br />With Croker, Bridger and Left Ear, being predominantly behind the wheel, the mini Coopers are prominently featured, on the streets, and in subway tunnels, and the storm drain systems of Los Angeles.  It's a short, but pretty cool ride, with Frazeli following the action from above, in a helicopter.  The ending is PG-13 soft, without the satisfaction of seeing old Steve pounded down like a nail, and the gang finally getting to enjoy their ill gotten gains.  They say it wasn't about the money, but it that just doesn't ring very true.  The film could be much edgier, but things flow so smoothly for the gang, that there is never a feeling of real danger.  And the writing is not as clever as it thinks it is.<br /><br />There is no commentary track, but the bonus featurettes cover the usual making of topics, plus things like the participants lack of familiarity with the original film, the writing of the screenplay, the stunts, and the driving training that the cast went through.  An ultracompetitive Theron, evidently had great enthusiasm for the driving.  Co-writers Donna and Wayne Powers seem extremely pleased with their screenplay, and how it was executed.  That the original film was almost completely gutted, matters not.  Interestingly, no interviews with Edward Norton appear in the featurettes.<br /><br />Although far from a homage to the original film, for what it is, \\"The LA Job\\" is a very slick, bold, fast moving, if superficial, action thriller, that mostly entertains.  F. Gary Gray is apparently hands on director, who does have a flair for capturing action.  The acting is not bad for a film of this type, with Wahlberg, Norton, and Theron being quite solid.  Jason Statham, who is capable of much, much more, is an underused team player, and Donald Sutherland's appearance is brief, but impactful.moving, if superficial, action thriller, that mostly entertains.

B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I've read many of the reviews here and agree with some of the sentiments on both the pros and cons of the series.  However, I think the real payoff on this series is toward the end, and you need the patience to stick through some episodes which does to meander a bit.  'The Pacific' chooses to focus more on the human cost of the war than the 'Band of Brothers' series and perhaps because of that, some viewers may find it harder to watch some episodes, and others might find it lacks the stand-alone entertainment value that 'Band of Brothers' so skillfully delivered.  Ultimately it's the film-maker's challenge to balance the grueling realism of fighting marines in a difficult environment and making it entertaining for the masses, and I think it achieves that goal, though in a way different from 'Band of Brothers.'
0786886811|4.0|If you like Nigella's TV series, you will like the way this book is written and presented. It contains recipes for a wide variety of baked goods, from cakes, pies, deserts to breads and my personal favourite and weakness chocolate.  This is not for the health conscious, you could probably put on weight by just looking at the pictures. But who cares if it tastes that good. I especially loved the children section which had bright, colourful and creative ideas which could be used for children's parties or just for spending quality time.
0375703861|2.0|I was anticipating a clever, intellectual style of writing from Smith, but found the book to be a jumbled mess of uninteresting characters and a poorly developed plot.  I put it down several times refusing to read any further, but it just bugged me not to finish it.  By the end, I was really angry that I wasted my time.  The author has very brief moments of clarity or interesting thought, but the book continuously slips back into banality.  There's nothing even remotely humorous about it.  It's just dull, disjointed (in the last paragraph, out of nowhere, the author addresses the reader directly??) and at times a bit crass for seemingly no good reason.  A failed attempt at creating a deep and meaningful novel.

In  an otherwise quite predictable and \\"normal\\" world, The Girl is unique, absolutely Individual, living in a world familiar to all of us, but guided only by her own clear (and highly practical) moral compass.  In following her adventures we see, off to the side and in fleeting brilliant flashes, the world we think we know in horrifying clarity.  The writing is excellent, the insights priceless.

B001BKTEZA|5.0|I read a lot of fantasy and non-fiction. I've been averse to classics since I hated lord of the rings, faulkner, and most of hemmingway. However Steinback stands in a class of his own. The sheer ease of reading alone should be enough to keep eyes fixed, let alone the sure-and-steady plot, textured characters, and every other chapter that emanates emotion, experience, plot, and thick smell of the times.<br /><br />I'd recommend this to anyone mature enough to enjoy something not written by James Patterson or Nora Roberts.

I mean, if I wanted to see that sort of thing, I would watch Hollywood news on the television.  Oh, well....  You don't have to look at the cover to listen to the music.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|The Young Victoria is a romantic movie-goers delight! My husband and I watch it over and over and over.<br /><br />The story begins with a young Victoria who is being pressured into signing a regency order which will ultimately transfer power from the future queen to her mother's lover, Victoria's guardian. Despite her youth, Victoria demonstrates her power and strength and denies the regency and is soon crowned queen.<br /><br />In the meantime, Prince Albert is being groomed to court the young queen. Although he finds himself immediately in love with Victoria, he patiently waits for her as she discovers her role as the queen. Victoria and Albert marry and sparks fly as the two compete in their daily responsibilities until Albert is shot and Victoria realizes she might lose the love of her life.<br /><br />The costuming is elaborate, romance engaging and location breathtaking. I highly recommend this film!
B0021L8V1G|2.0|The gilded surface is worn through and the glint no longer shimmers, but what \\"Iron Man 2\\" lacks in fun it makes up for with pathos. Like many a darker second chapter in the journey of a super-hero, the true villains would surface as those that dwelled within. Superman, Luke Skywalker, and Spiderman all had to fight with who they were, although to be fair, Peter Parker always seemed to run away in any movie regardless.    The same holds true for Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), who despite facing the triple threat of a passionate senator (Gary Shandling), a fellow industrialist (Sam Rockwell), and a vengeful Russian hacker and possible lion tamer (Mickey Rourke), the biggest danger still lies within the man in the iron suit. After all, it grows increasingly hard to believe that they could pose Stark any more danger than he already does to himself as we watch as Stark happily dishes out massive amounts of damage to his own home in a self-destructive downward spiral in a moment that feels all too awkwardly autobiographical by Downey, playing a man coping with the excesses of fame.    Which is an integral point that the movie revolves around: Where does a superhero story go after the man of steel outs himself to the world? None of the other superheroes had this problem, and while they're all too busy hiding their identity from the world, Iron Man busies himself protecting his right to save it. It is an interesting and a radical departure from the traditional mould, but one that ultimately is let down by the script, written by newcomer and actor Justin Theroux, who unfortunately is neither able to do justice to such a bold idea, nor to measure up to his predecessors.     And this is where the movie suffers the most. Where the first entry was fun, exciting, and more importantly, fresh, this sequel simply lumbers heavily from action set piece to action set piece, with none of the wit, cohesiveness, or direction that made the first so endearing. While the actors all give ittheir best, they are all ultimately let down by a disappointing script that gives characters a lot to do, yet nothing to do.    Visually, the film cannot be faulted. Directed once again by Jon Favreau, it does have the advantage of being a refreshing take on an otherwise tired genre, but even despite Favreau's best efforts as he once again successfully delivers a different vibe, he can do little as the writing ultimately lets down the picture.     Rourke, as the central villain, has a little more than a cameo in \\"Iron Man 2\\", where he seems to be in a completely different movie. A Dostoyevsky tragedy perhaps, which makes his standoffs with Stark all the more jarring. Likewise, Scarlett Johansson has a brief role that really contributes little except to help tie this movie into a future `superhero team' movie. More fitting though is Rockwell's performance, as he plays industrialist Justin Hammer as both the shadowy reflection of, and a man deeply in live with the idea of Tony Stark.      Perhaps therein lays the tragedy of this sequel. It tries too hard to be like its predecessor, to give audiences a familiar sight through different lenses again, but unfortunately glosses over what made \\"Iron Man\\" work. No amount of exploding robots or martial artistry can make up for true purpose in a story, which is what this sequel lacks.    Still, \\"Iron Man 2\\" gets the job done. Perhaps not as effectively, but sufficiently, with more than a few screws left over.

B002ZG983M|5.0|It hurts to be a hero. Bad guys have knives, good guys cause collateral damage, and the general public simply doesn't care. But it is ridiculously fun to watch how all this plays out in Kick-Ass, with someone else taking the hurt for us.    It is a simple story of a teenager (Aaron Johnson) so enamored with the fictional exploits of his comic-book heroes that he decides to become one. As Kick-Ass, what Dave Lizewski lacks in super-powers, he makes up for with two batons and lot of good intentions. Eventually, Lizewski finds aid and conflict in the form of two brutal vigilantes, Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), and the three set out to end the reign of a local crime boss (Mark Strong), who just so happens to be the father of an unlikely ally.    Indeed, `Kick-Ass' plays almost like an overlong homage to Spiderman: Alienated youth? Check. Unrequited love? Check. A friend with a murderous father? Check. However, whereas the tale of Spiderman, tragic as it may be, remains grounded in the realm of rose-tinted spandex, Kick-Ass chooses to dig deeper into the pathos, exploring the harsh realities of being a caped crusader in an all too familiar, disillusioned society.    Ironically, as the titular character, Johnson turns in what may very well be the picture's most forgettable performance. Forced to bumble around, jovially getting his `ass kicked', Johnson is less Peter Sellers than he is an even more depressing Peter Parker.     That isn't to say that Johnson doesn't acquit himself well enough, but honestly, could any man ever be expected to top Cage's eccentricity? With an Adam West impersonation of `Big Daddy', and a Don Knotts rendition for alter ego Damon Macready, perhaps the only time we really get to see Cage being his bizarre self is in a tragic, yet unintentionally hysterical scene, where Cage begins screaming (or is it singing?) unintelligible commands. Look up at the screen! Is he in pain? Is he in ecstasy? It's Nicolas Cage!    So leave itto a little girl to steal Cage's limelight. Turning in a career-making performance as the cutesy and murderous child-fatale, Moretz does for `Kick-Ass' what Yoda's unexpected martial artistry did for the Star Wars prequel trilogy. Unabashedly violent and vulgar, Moretz may be very well be the youngest anti-hero of this, or any generation. That is not to say that it's hard to root for her. Indeed, Moretz may be the film's biggest draw even if for those very reasons alone!    Certainly, one won't be watching `Kick-Ass' for its borrowed visuals. It's too bad that director Matthew Vaughn chose not to further define his relatively new visual style, opting instead to mimic a nouveau Tarantino, and by extension, the expressions of many a Japanese and Spaghetti-Western director. Even the music, with its adrenaline pumping surf beats and kitschy tunes, seems an all too familiar experience, going as far to include a redressed track from '28 Days Later'.    Still, it is understandable, considering that the plot and characterizations mostly stand on borrowed legs, so too would the stylistic choices of the film. Otherwise, `Kick-Ass' rarely fails to disappoint, and as a parable on the dangers of being a hero in a world of red, `Kick-Ass' really does kick ass.
1428144331|5.0|I first listened to the book Nineteen Minutes by Jodi Picoult on cd from the library and loved it so much I had to have it.

B0039ZF89G|3.0|Enough already with the remastered, repackaged, rereleases of the Stones catalog.  As a collector for many years it's getting hard and maybe a little pointless to keep up with all the repackaging of the same old stuff.  Sure, the bonus tracks are nice but who wants to listen to a 40 year old instrumental track with vocals from just this year?  It just doesn't work on the five or so tracks given this treatment.  The true almost untouched demos like Loving Cup are good, however.      More about the repackaging - as far as I know this set is available in a multitude of different packages.  Deluxe, Super Deluxe, Bonus Tracks Only, Vinyl, CD with T-shirt (Target exclusive), CD with bonus interview disc (Best Buy exclusive), and the little known McDonald's release that includes a #2 value meal (with or without cheese).  Enough already!  I thought Decca/Europe beat this to death in the 70's and 80's - the constant repackaging of the same old music.  My head is spinning just trying to keep up with all the versions of this release.  Of course, as an avid collector I'll eventually buy them all.  Just good marketing by the Stones camp I guess.    In fairness, this Super Deluxe edition is really nice.  Everything is first class and sounds good but not better than the original 70's vinyl in my opinion.
B001GCUO5M|5.0|\\"Shutter island\\" is the first largo in which Scorsese deals with a dark, sinister and at first sight a terror film. But, at second sight, the movie is a merciless metaphor that emblematizes the dark years after the WW2. it's not a mere coincidence the arouse of the Noir genre began precisely since 1946, in which the ghosts, phantoms and dragons nestled during these oppressing years got out from the Pandora' box. The dark experiments about genetics well known during the Nazi Germany (Do you remember QB VII from Leon Uris ?) didn't come at end when the War was over. Furthermore, these cruel exercises of experimentation continued with or without the total consent of many regimes around the world. Brainwashes, hypnosis, subliminal messages, induced behavior patterns intermingled with many needs of an emerging market that desperately needed to blossom -if you may- as cathartic device in order to forget the horrid memories of a recent past.<br /><br />Dark films like Stalag 17, Shock corridor,  Psycho,Invasion of the body snatchers, Them, The man with the golden arm, Bitter victory, Catch 22, The planet of the apes, The island of Dr. Moreau, Dementia 13 or THX 1138, were part of many films that explored and felt the necessity to express the dark side of the moon as product of a brave new world that now had to deal with the consequences of the nuclear issues, radioactive residues, contamination and pollution. But there was something more in the air, the political environment (the well known witch's hunt undertaken by then), was also at its most algid moment. Spies everywhere plus the tensions derived from the Cold War were motives far enough to forge a social corpus in which the insanity and the spiritual wounds made to blossom the birth of the rock, the cool jazz and the new rebel kids of the Literature as Alan Gingsberg, Jack Kerouac or Camus, Sartre, Andric, Hamsun on the other side of the Atlantic.<br /><br />These reflections are present and suggested in the film, through audacious metaphors and apparently coincidental facts.<br /><br />Kingsley as always steals the show (He is one of the ten greatest actors in the world); Max von Sydow is superb too in his brief cameo, Mark Ruffalo plays a sensitive but crucial role and Di Caprio exhibits punch and talent.<br /><br />A worthy to watch film.metaphors and apparently coincidental facts.

It simply needs a compelling story told in an entertaining way and Slumdog delivers.

B003AO1SVS|4.0|Consistant with the marketing theme of this album, I wish the Black Keys would have put that warning on the cover as well. Sorry, but honestly I love the Black Keys for one thing: dirty riff based hard rockin' blues!! I know that seems selfish and closed minded, but truthfully on earlier albums I'd listen to their occasional ballads a couple times but they would soon be quickly skipped to get to the good stuff.  I've got nothing against ballads or bands expanding and evolving, but for some reason when the Black Keys would try it on previous albums, it just didn't click with me. That said, however, this may be the first Black Keys album that actually may give me pause and make me listen to their mellow side. The \\"WARNING\\" of course is directed at the many fans like myself because when I first put on this album on my way to work and heard the first several songs I thought \\"YES! The Black Keys are back doing what they do best...full on ROCK!\\" I couldn't wait to hear the rest of it! Little did I know that the rest of it would be part mid-tempo hip-hop style tunes followed by even mellower bluesy soul ballads. With each passing song I kept hoping the next one would rock but I couldn't help but be disappointed when they didn't. Had I been \\"warned\\" I may have been more open to giving the rest of the album its due. Now, after a couple subsequent listens, I can say that the latter half does have a lot of good songs worth digging into, even for fans like myself. The midtempo stuff is very cool. It makes me curious to check out their BlacRoc side project. As for the mellow tunes that close out the album, they aren't soft rock songs like bad Peter Cetera ballads or the band Bread. They're still very much Black Keys songs-soulful, but gritty with a rough edge. I may still long for the Black Keys circa \\"Rubber Fatory,\\" I still think its by far what they do best. However, fans of the early stuff will get a dose of that with this album and it may be the first to prove to everyone that there is more to dig about the Black Keys.

It's been almost four years and I still sleep better then I ever did before I listed to the hypnobirthing CDs.
B003CIG7AE|5.0|I was first exposed to Band of Horses, with their 2007 release \\"Cease to Begin\\", and instantly became a fan. From the reviews I read for that album, many fans were disappointed with the direction the band chose to take. While I have since listened to older Band of Horses and enjoyed what I heard, Infinite Arms, I feel takes the band to another level. The album flows so well from one track to the next. The most impressive tracks are: Factory, Blue Beard, Evening Kitchen, Older, NW Apt. and my favorite track Neighbor. This album is a must listen!!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Excellent little sharpener. Easy to carry with your knife.  I sharpened all my Victorinox and Wenger knives with it. I can feel the difference in knife edge. Cutting performance for the knives improved. Just razor sharp.  Love it !!! At this price, its a bargain. Highly recommended.
B00275EGX8|1.0|This movie is an absolute waste of time. I thought it was going to be awesome because it won an Oscar, but it is just the same old Hollywood dribble. I don't know how it beat Avatar for best film. OH wait, the producer emailed all his hollywood friends begging them to vote for his film.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The young protagonist of the book says this: \\"I have hated the words and I have loved them, and I hope I have made them right.\\"  I'm sure I can not make the words \\"right\\" and do this book justice in a review.  It's just that good.    This is a story, narrated by Death, about a young girl in Germany during World War II.  I understand this is a YA book, but it is enjoyable for adults.    Zusaks' prose was amazing.  I've highlighted many quotes.  The book is like an onion.  There are so many layers and it's likely to make you cry.  The layers are amazing.  There is a lot of depth to the book and a lot going on with characters and plot.  I thought it was really interesting how Death would tell us something about what was to come, but just a small snippet.  Then when the time arrived, it was like a distant memory or a sense of déjà vu in that I kind of knew what was about to happen on a larger scale but the details were about to be filled in.    I truly felt for the characters.  They were extremely well developed.  Liesel is an amazing protagonist.  I adored her and then with her, I laughed, cried, got angry, and was fearful. She nearly came to life for me.  Hans and Rosa are also worth mentioning as well written characters.    This is a beautiful book.
B000003C2U|5.0|\\"Human\\" is a classy, inexorable monolith of a metal album that elevated Death to new technical heights and paved the way for many great things to come.  Of all of their releases I own (which excludes Leprosy and Spiritual Healing) this is my favorite.  For starters, the raw production provides for a very intimate experience that overpolished music cannot afford.  This makes the opening riff of \\"Flattening of Emotions,\\" a personal favorite, even more of a crushing juggernaut and paves the way for the rest of this incredible metal milestone.  Death frontman and auteur, the late Chuck Schuldiner, offers up some great guitar wizardry and equally compelling lyrics, while his symbiotic trade-offs with guitarist Paul Masvidal are some of the most fluid ever recorded in the genre.  Steve DiGigorgio's fretless bass adds some nice grooves to the mix and takes a life of its own on the ambient instrumental \\"Cosmic Sea,\\" while pre-Cynic drummer Sean Reinert proves to be a worthy predecessor of Gene Hoglan.<br /><br />The album is a bit short, clocking in at only a little over a half hour, but its brevity only serves to emphasize its timelessness.  \\"Human\\" has stood a whopping nineteen-year test of time, and will always be a Grade-A metal classic.  Death would go on to record three superb albums afterward, but this is still the peak for me.<br /><br />Highlights: Flattening of Emotions, Suicide Machine, Secret Face, Lack of Comprehension, Cosmic Sea
B003AO1SVS|5.0|An early contender for album of the year, and for me this is easily the best album   The Keys have made. I have always liked the Keys, some of their songs are fantastic   3 minute riffed-out stompers, but albumwhise they have never been on heavy rotation.   This however, is pure class and gonna stick for a long time.   The R&B and soul influences are more significant on Brothers than on anything they   have done before, and I see some Black Keys fans think this is too soft compared to   their older stuff (The most entertaining remark being; \\" there is NO excuse for   falsetto, this is not The Bee Gees\\"!! HA HA HA!), but I just don't get the criticism.   It's not like they have gone in a completely new direction. \\"You're the one\\" from   \\"Magic Potion\\" is very similar to the more mellow stuff on \\"Brothers\\"   This is a GREAT album and there is no mistaking it for anything else than the Black   Keys. Their sound just got refined, reshuffled and reimagined. Same, but different!    And by the way, falsetto works like a mother!
B000TPZJNE|5.0|This is really a must have object! The sound quality is extremely good. Its hard to believe that the recordings were made in 1973. The music itself is a matter of taste.
B0035G5IOE|3.0|The dialogue and situations are not oriented toward children, perhaps preadolescents will find it more appealing. As an adult, I did not find the story cogent. The artwork is great, but the story is only loosely based on the book by Roald Dahl, and suffers greatly because of it. My 5 year old daughter and eight year old son had trouble paying attention throughout the movie.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|I really enjoy this CD. Very well put together, and good progressions. Nice fresh group. I hope they continue to write and perform this well.
B001C3EI7U|1.0|The song samples here don't match the titles on the Verve album, \\"Blues In Time\\".  I don't know what this is.

0740748475|5.0|If you're a Calvin and Hobbs fan, you need to get the book. It's that simple.    And to think there is a generation or two who don't know about Calvin and Hobbs? Sad indeed.
B000BSLU2S|4.0|To be honest I can't really give this a decent review. I used it to try and fix my 60 gig Playstation 3 which had a some what common problem called YLOD (PS3 stops working). The process didn't work but I am confident that it wasn't Arctic Silver's fault.<br /><br />I would say that the tube was a lot smaller than I thought. It's about 2 inches in length, enough to cover at least 10 cpu chips (you only need a little).<br /><br />Still, having to pay almost $10 for a 2 inch tube, plus almost twice that in shipping was a little much (I live in the Caribbean).

0743297334|2.0|Gallons of ink have been spilled over what Gertrude Stein labeled \\"the lost generation.\\" The label was used primarily for American expatriates who flooded into Paris after World War I. Ernest Hemingway was a central figure, no doubt because he documented their lives in such books as [[ASIN:0684833638 A Moveable Feast]] as well as this one. The author was a literary icon of the `60's. I've been re-reading his works; still found much excellence in [[ASIN:0684859238 To Have and Have Not (Scribner Classics)]] but it took significant will-power to finish \\"The Sun Also Rises.\\"<br /><br />The story is told through the eyes of Jake Barnes, who had the most feared of war wounds, which meant he could never consummate his relationship with Lady Brett Ashley, who had been his nurse during the recovery period. Obviously it was frustrating for her, which may have been the reason she managed to bed most of the other characters in the story. There are a half dozen other principal characters, including another woman. Jake is a reporter, but there is so little factual news that the reader cannot even tell if it is the early `20's or the latter years of that decade. The novel is an account of their toing and froing; they are immensely puerile and self-absorbed. The inane conversations, ah, \\"the dialogue\\" so often resembles today's: \\"Eh, what's happening. Nothing, how `bout you.\\" It was excruciatingly painful to read. And it was devoid of any sign of irony on Hemingway's part.<br /><br />The novel's settings are primarily in Paris, and towards the end the \\"action\\" moves to Pamplona, in Spain, to see the bull fights. But the backdrop for the character's passions and quarrels is so one-dimensional; I thought it might be like going to Las Vegas to see the Pyramids, or the canals of Venice--a totally ersatz experience. The French and Spaniards in the story are just so many props... there is no real insight into their character. And overall, there is pitifully little to learn about these societies during the inter-war period. The main thing Hemingway seems to get right is the street names in Paris. And certainly the restaurant, the Closerie des Lilas, remains a \\"destination\\" for American tourists because of him.<br /><br />Then there is the madness of bull fighting itself, which can be off-putting to more sensitive souls. I saw one, briefly, in Arles. At least in the one I saw, the horses had thick pads which protected them; in Hemingway's book, they did not, no doubt reflecting the reality of the event.<br /><br />Shallow characters, insipid, whining interactions, set against poorly described \\"exotic\\" settings.

B00001R3GI|2.0|I give it two stars. Not the overall album, which is ten stars, but the resissue and remastering job. I've got the mid-1990s collectors edition, which doesn't have the unissued songs - but I do have a boot (I happened upon) of the previously unissued ones - he, he, he.    First the unissued material. The Exile boots I have of the unissued songs really capture a lot of the raw power of the Stones back in the early 1970s. They have a lot of depth and not much mixing. The bootlegs are bootiful. Mick's vocal is absent on several bootlegs versions of songs or he's quoting jibberish. Plus there's some material on the boots that probably could have been reissued in 2010 but was not. The boots give a lot of insight into the stones process, which is what we all really want.      I was also disappointed in the packaging of the 2010 reissue. The collectors edition resissue from the mid-1990s - the first stones album I ever had - has reproduction glossy postcard miniatures, a square glossy card with track information and it's packaged like an LP and put into a plastic case, which gives you a lot of the feel of the album when you pull it out. The packaging is also glossy, compared to the dull board used on the 2010 reissue.     This disc's packaging is not as sharp or pretty or lets face it - fun. Screw an exile t-shirt like the target package offers with a guitar pick. Rock t-shirts meant something when they were truly torn and frayed and before anyone and their brother could get an AC/DC shirt at Wal-Mart.     My recommendation, search low and hi for the boots and don't pay attention to the rehash from the suits.     The mix on the 2010 is overly polished. The mix on the mid-1990s collectors edition is still pretty raw. The 2010 reissue sounds like stones circa 2010, not Stones circa 1970. The new fans who will pick this up are getting ska-roo'ed.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|This is a wonderful album from start to finish. Nas and Damian Marley should be proud. Recommended for everyone.
B0015AARJI|4.0|Product arrived very fast and works great. However, the product description states that the controller \\"Can be charged at any time through the PlayStation 3 system using the controller's USB cable,\\" indicating that the controller comes with the necessary charging cable. But, it doesn't and no where on product page do they tell you that the cable is not included and must be purchased seperately, a little heads up would have been nice to bundle purchases. Other than that, I am very pleased with the purchase.
B002ZTQVBQ|5.0|Spirited Away to me is the greatest animated film of all time, and after growing up with the other Studio Ghibli films I was worried that Ponyo might not live up to Miyazaki's standard. However I found Ponyo to be a very light innocent film that is not seen today. While watching, I was genuinely happy and smiling for the majority of the film.<br /><br />Artistically, like Hayao's other films, it is bar none the most beautiful drawn world in today's animation. Think of Ponyo as if The Little Mermaid met My Neighbor Totoro, with the originality of Spirited Away, and that should give you an idea of what to expect.<br /><br />Voice acting is very good, with Liam Neeson outperforming everybody else as Fujimoto, the father of Ponyo. Tina Fey also does a surprisingly stellar job as Lisa, the mother of Sosuke.<br /><br />The Soundtrack is yet again perfectly fitting and portrays the scenes well, Joe Hisaishi did another tremendous job.<br /><br />So if you haven't already, pick up Ponyo and prepare to let your mind wonder and enjoy the last film made by the great Hayao Miyazaki!
0143113100|5.0|The brain, source of our perceptions and evaluations and actions, is central to our understanding of our individual and collective selves.  And it changes all the time!  And we can cause changes intentionally! Think about that.  A quick and easy read but do just one chapter at a time.  There's so much to absorb.
B002ZG98VE|5.0|I adored this movie.  Not only did it give some humor, action, and what not- but it also gave a much more realistic and historic view of the famous Robin Hood.    I was watching the History channel the night before we went to see this movie in the theaters.  I think it gave the movie sort of a prequel of what to expect along with actual historical information- whether it was on the kings, Robin Hood himself, or the weapons used.  The amount of detail that went into the movie to make sure it was as historically accurate as possible was amazing.  The construction of the bows, the shields and weapons used (my favorite part was the war hammer that Robin used near the end!) and the horses.      If you aren't interested in the historical part of RH and would rather see tons of explosions and what not- this movie may not be for you.  If you are interested in a more realistic/historic tale of Robin Hood- then I think you'll enjoy this piece.     Check out the History channel's special on Robin Hood- [...]  I think you'll come to find how amazing this movie is along with the amount of detail that was put into the weaponry and other items in the movie.
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has a very successful formula for books that sell. \\"Outliers\\" follows that formula.

They give understanding and practical insight into\\"why it is so\\".
B002NXSRW0|4.0|Okay, let's make things clear:  This movie isn't perfect.  It's a big bloated explod-a-thon, similar to the Transformers movies.  It should have been MUCH better, considering the source material.  That said, it IS pretty good.  If you go into it expecting it to be just as good as the movie in your head when you read the comics, you will be disappointed.  But, it's far less cheesy than the cartoon, and hits a bunch of little easter eggs for fans of the comic.  A few examples: In a flashback, we see Storm Shadow fleeing after 'killing' the Hard Master - except that we don't actually see him make the kill.  We just see him running away, and he could easily have been chasing someone.  Another tiny little nod - Breaker steals a piece of double-bubble gum from Duke.  It makes no sense in the movie, unless you know that Breaker eats bubble gum in the comic, and they constantly had ads for double-bubble within it's pages.  There are lots of others like that.  In fact my one big beef with the movie is their handling of the Baroness at the end, and mainly because it completely violates the established canon.  The Baroness is supposed to be evil, without excuses.  They make her only evil because she has been 'brainwashed.'  Insulting to the character.  Still, for Joe fans, it was certainly worthy of the name, and I hope they make the sequel better still.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|Couple this album and the heavily slept-on \\"UNTITLED\\" album from a couple years back, and you have an MC, who although its taken over a decade since Illmatic, has found his lane. To me, it feels like finally he is making the music that he wants to make( and listen to), regardless of whatever other path the genre has taken.He has taken it upon himself to explore sociological issues of the likes that Public Enemy and to a lesser extent NWA before tackled regularly. Its the sort of stuff you'd expect from the intermittent offerings of Dead Prez but I feel because its Nas he doesn't get enough credit for it. It's never been about making music for the clubs for him and that has to be commended in an era of rap where it appears that this is all that matters. Artists such as Jay Electronica can patronise and preach about the content of other artists like Drake and Cudi, but the fact remains that none of them are out there making polemical tracks, let alone albums like Nasty Nas. He is a true great
B002BU0DPE|5.0|This product was amazing. It was my first turtle beach headset I've ever owned and I was very satisfied with it. The games sounded so real, with the game sounds blasting right into my ear. The chords are incredibly long which make it easy to be able to sit anywhere in the room. The control device is very easy to use, although I don't think the chat boost works to it's best. It's very easy to set up and I'd recommend it to any gamer looking for a competitive edge.
B0038VPB5W|4.0|i never regarded BFMV music to  be as pulverizing or aggressive as KSE, Lamb of God, AILD, trivium but,  however their command of harmonics is better then any contemporary band today.  Thier  able to blend a  traditional style of thrash metal & power metal while working in a modern twist. Unlike the bands i compared them to, BMFV have not lost their touch and continue to make catchy songs. I think these guys will outlast all the metal core acts and will escalate their popularity in the future.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|If you liked \\"The Duchess,\\" you will like \\"The Young Victoria!\\"  Emily Blunt does a spectacular job playing the young Queen Victoria, as does Rupert Friend as the youthful Prince Albert!  The general mood, music and costume design truly enhance the beauty of this eloquent film of history book romance.  Not too sure about the historic accuracy of the film (I'm not as well versed about Queen Victoria as I am about, say, Elizabeth I or her father, Henry VIII), but it is nonetheless a delightful film that just didn't enjoy enough time on the big screen.

B000025SL5|4.0|Vangelis is best known to many music fans for his film soundtracks.  His score for Hugh Hudson's \\"Chariots of Fire\\" (1981) made quite a splash in its time; nowadays, however, his soundtrack music for Ridley Scott's \\"Blade Runner\\" (1982) is probably best-known and most highly regarded.  Vangelis worked with Scott again on the 1992 film \\"1492: Conquest of Paradise,\\" one of two films released that year in commemoration of the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus's voyage across the Atlantic.  Even if \\"1492\\" the soundtrack does not quite reach the heights that Vangelis achieved in \\"Blade Runner,\\" it still provides tuneful, anthemic music of the kind for which Vangelis is known.  If you like Vangelis's work on film scores, or if you are a fan of the film \\"1492,\\" you should enjoy this soundtrack.
B003AO1SVS|3.0|Those Akron, OH boys have grown up and out of their surroundings.  I loved the first two albums, I was a bit disappointed with Rubber Factory.  Then Magic Potion made me walk away completely.  I avoided all of the trash that came after Magic Potion.  Then I saw the new record, read the rolling stone article and took a listen to the tracks.  They have evolved sonically into a more standard Blues band.  There are thousands of Blues bands scrapping by that sound just like this.  Yet, the Blues Keys, er, the Black Keys, are making a buck being just like those other bands.  If you like Blues records, then you'll probably like this one.  If you want old Black Keys, go listen to those records.  Those days are gone my friends, welcome to the machine....
B0039ZF89G|5.0|I bought the vinyl, Deluxe, and Super Deluxe packages. This boxed set is very well made and a beauty to hold on to. No need to review the album as we all know what a masterpiece that is. I assume the mastering of the CD in this kit matches that of the Deluxe which is mastered too loud. Hopefully the vinyl will sound better. The hard bound book in this set was a lot of fun to read and the pictures were really great. There are at least 3 pictures showing Mick Taylor who's virtuoso guitar playing on the album makes it what it is. The DVD is a short tease of what will hopefully be fully released someday (i.e. CS Blues). The post cards are included in this set. All in all this is a really cool collector's item for fans of the Mick Taylor era who can afford it.
0393324818|4.0|The book is great for what it is. The information is good. However, it could have used a proofreader.  There are several instances of problems with subject/verb agreement. And, for a book that is included as a business book it has some pretty raw language.<br /><br />However, it is written in a way that tells a great story. It pulls the reader in and keeps them there. The information provided by the book as far as game theory is concerned is missing. It provides a little information but not much.
B000002GJ7|5.0|I can't say I love every song completely... but it is SOOOO close.  Definitely a five star item when you only have five stars to work with.  The album is groovy, melodic, intelligent, and still nice and heavy.  Extreme was in a zone.  All in all, I think it is by far their best album (because III Sides, while even more fantastic in some spots, still had weaknesses primarily in side I).  On here, He-man Woman Hater is one of my all time favorite songs.  I don't care for the flight of the bumble bee intro, but I just burned a copy of it without the intro.  I have a sticker on my cd that says 1:38 or something like that to mark the point where song actually starts from my radio DJ days.  Between that fantastic song and other classics like Decadent Dance, Suzi, It's A Monster, Money, Get The Funk Out, and Pornograffitti are all top notch excellent... in general the heavy songs are absolutely fantastic.  The slower songs are hit and miss for me.  I think More Than Words (while overplayed) is still a very very good song.  I personally do not care for Hole Hearted and think Song For Love and When I First Kiss you are mostly forgettable.  They are the things that keep this album from being a perfect album for me, but you can just skip them if you do not like them.  Not that any of them are really bad songs.  I just do not think Hole Hearted was single worthy and I definitely do not like it wasting space in a live Extreme set list... but still, I realize it was a single and therefore many people will and do love it.  Anyway, for any fan of heavy metal, this is one of those must have albums.  Great guitar work... great vocals... great songs... great production.  This one really has it all for people that like nice and crunchy guitars and catchy songs.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|One of the must watch movies. This movie is in the list of IMDB's top 100 and rightly  so.

B000002G0P|5.0|If I rated the sides, Side 1 would be a 3 star, Side II would be 4 stars and Side III would be 5 Stars plus.  BUT... Side III (The Truth) is arguably the most brilliant 20(ish) minutes ever recorded.  I LOVE IT.  So, to me, the CD deserves 5 stars and a purchase just from that side alone.  Outside of side III I find a handful of songs I really like... most notably Stop the World, Cupid's Dead, and Our Father.  Unfortunately, most of the rest show the cracks that only got bigger as Extreme's career moved on.  They haven't done anything remotely as great as their best work on here and Pornograffitti.  If you are a buyer of MP3s, you definitely could just go with the songs I mentioned by name here and I am confident you would not miss anything significant.  Side I was especially disappointing to me because that was supposed to be the \\"rocking/heavy\\" side and I think, aside from Cupids Dead, the songs are not very good.  I don't even really care for the initial single Rest in Peace.
B002JCSWV6|3.0|Clint Eastwood seems absent from this little movie until the credits at the end.  What could have been a powerful little drama ends up being a volley between a hero president of South Africa and a Rugby Field.  Granted we know a lot about the extraordinary Nelson Mandela and his surviving imprisonment to be released and form a government that through his inspiration brought an end to Apartheid.  This little story about how he focused on encouraging a Rugby team's determination and success in winning the 1995 World Cup for Rugby and for bringing together a splintered country into a unified whole is well worth knowing, but little else happens here - we discover no insights into Nelson Mandela's character or that of his chosen inspirer François Pienaar. Clint Eastwood is usually far more sensitive and dramatic.<br /><br />The name of the movie is taken from the 1875 poem that inspired Mandela during his years of imprisonment.  And it seems appropriate to quote that full poem here:<br />INVICTUS<br /><br />Out of the night that covers me,<br />Black as the Pit from pole to pole,<br />I thank whatever gods may be<br />For my unconquerable soul.<br /><br />In the fell clutch of circumstance<br />I have not winced nor cried aloud.<br />Under the bludgeonings of chance<br />My head is bloody, but unbowed.<br /><br />Beyond this place of wrath and tears<br />Looms but the Horror of the shade,<br />And yet the menace of the years<br />Finds, and shall find, me unafraid.<br /><br />It matters not how strait the gate,<br />How charged with punishments the scroll.<br />I am the master of my fate:<br />I am the captain of my soul.<br /><br />William Ernest Henley<br /><br />Henley may not have become a poet known for anything else but this poem, but he will always be quoted when it comes to stories such as this one.  The superb actor Morgan Freeman endures denture and facial make up and a shaky new accent as Nelson Mandela, but this is a flat performance - OK, but not memorable.  Matt Damon obviously buffed up for his role and learned  a new accent as François Pienaar and seems to know his mission, but again the performance is flat line and not impressive.  The entire cast is adequate for the little they contribute.  Yes, we want to love this movie and the ending does make us swell with admiration, but it is the getting there that seems an overwrought and excessive 93 minutes!  Worth seeing if only to applaud once again the achievements of Nelson Mandela. Grady Harp, May 10and seems to know his mission, but again the performance is flat line and not impressive.

B001FB4VZS|2.0|Smallville season eight was a disapointment. The start of the season is good, with chloe's wedding, but after that episode when Lana comes back, it tanks.     I have watched Smallville from the beginning and I greatly enjoy it. The acting and story-line is great. The biggest flaw in season 8 is Lex Luthor, or the lack of Lex. To me, Lex is an ancher of the show. You could ask anyone who the villin in Superman/Smallvile is, I doubt they would say Tess Mercer, they would say \\"Lex Luthor\\". I know that the actor who played lex (Micheal Rosenbaum) wanted out, but then you either get a new actor or possibly wrap the show up.    Like I said earlier, season 8 is good up until the episode \\"Bride\\" from then on it really goes down hill.

B003BKF696|5.0|High Violet is genuinely haunting--the melodies (\\"Didn't wanna be your ghost,\\" \\"It's a terrible love and I'm walking with spiders,\\" \\"Standing here at the foot of your love') slowly but surely work their way into the consciousness. While Boxer was a fantastic album, High Violet is arguably more mature, especially in a musical sense. Although I somewhat mourn the loss of the driving post-punk rhythms of albums past, The National replace that rhythmic momentum with lush string and background vocal arrangements that build almost cinematic tension This tension builds but never quite releases, mirroring the anxiety of Matt Berninger's lyrics. The fear that permeates High Violet --allowing enough listens--will radiate through the body and mind of the listener. And yet, this is the most achingly beautiful fearfulness I've ever experienced.
B001TNGOXY|5.0|I love this movie it is so funny and the characters played their roles so well. I like it even better in BluRay and I got such a good deal for it here on Amazon because I could not find it in stores. This is a good love story. =)
B0026ICMOG|4.0|It is a good purchase. Cute plush toys of all the dwarfs and includes the DVD/Blu-ray combo. I was really only disappointed that the discs came in a DVD casing rather than the smaller Blu-ray disc casing. This combo is considered the Platinum Edition. If you want the Blu-ray disc casing, you'll need to go with the Diamond Edition...though you'll only be able to find the Platinum Edition case with the plush toys.

B003D83DPA|1.0|BD is a fantastic format for high def pic and sound. Unfortunately this BD is not worth to be called a BD. The sound is perfect but the picture.... I do not wish to spend mine money to buy a BD if the quality is equal to a dvd and in this canse even to a VHS.  Is this BD simply 'money making' by the record company? Why release it on BD if the BD standards can not be met. Could the 'hair' not have been digitaly removed or were the original master tapes not available to create a new 'mix' without that annoying camera angle. And that's only one camera fault. What about the grain, the soft, the dirt.I happen to have this concert on VHS and it's the same poor PQ quality on the BD and the 20yo worn out vhs. It is even written on the MK website that this BD has been remastered, well it's not visible that it was.

B0039TD826|4.0|First, I'm going to comment on the content of Exile on Main Street, and at the end I'll comment on the quality of this particular remastered release.<br /><br />It's probably silly to declare a preference for one Stones album over another. To say \\"Exile\\" is their \\"most adventurous\\" or \\"most creative\\" or \\"most consistent\\" misses, entirely, the beauty of this remarkable release. There's a feeling to it that transcends these mundane distinctions; a spirit of ambivalence to these traditional qualifications and pedestrian standards. The music here simply \\"is\\", existing in its own time and space unlike any other Stones effort. Effort is perhaps a misleading word to use here because these songs all feel as though they've come into being without any great effort. They seem to have just materialized out of the moist ether, passively channeled through the unintentional, but supremely capable talents of these charmed fellows. Exile on Main Street is notable for its lack of drama. There's relatively little Sturm and Drang, that effective device found on the best of their other albums - a contrasting of the more menacing, threatening rockers against more lilting, luxurious ballads which works to emphasis the opposed and distinct tone of each. The songs on Exile all seem to be getting along surprisingly well with one another. No jarring tempo shifts or striking volume changes; they've all agreed to play nice.<br /><br />Take the song \\"Happy\\" that jangles and bounces around its cacophonous melodic marsh with all the sincerity and honesty of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir but with none of the absurd smugness that such \\"joyful\\" music usually exudes. It's just uninhibited, unmitigated happiness. This infectious ditty leads right into the wonderfully titled \\"Turd on the Run\\", a rollicking rabble-rouser that cares less about revolution and chaos than it does about getting you on your feet and making you shake what the good lord gave ya. It's then followed by the sublimely earthy grunt of \\"Ventilator Blues\\" that kicks and stomps all over some fantastical bayou of the mind. Chugging out massive breaths of swampy rhythm - thumping and grinding - it soon flows into the vaguely distinct shuffle of \\"Just Wanna See his Face\\", echoing forth from perhaps a mossy shack deep within that misty bog. You see, these tunes are all like puffs and plumes of escaping vapor from a rickety whiskey still, a passive release of heat and energy threatening a catastrophic explosion at any moment, but none the less somehow maintaining a carefree, rowdy party groove.<br /><br />The most raucous moments are when blasting backing horns herald a particularly festive boogie on the opener \\"Rocks Off\\", on the joyous \\"All Down the Line\\" and also on the afore mentioned Keith Richards marvel \\"Happy.\\" Song number two, \\"Rip This Joint\\", manages to respect the uptempo country party mood while reveling in the good ol' boy sport of fist fighting. A blazing sax solo keeps the swinging and punching harmless enough fun. \\"Shake Your Hips\\" slides around on a Bo Diddly inspired groove of throbbing guitars, and snapping, popping drums, and is confidently led by a super twangy Mick. \\"Tumbling Dice\\", a well deserved star of this show, pulses with the sweetest funky bass and syncopated drum; an exceptionally catchy blending of intricately interweaving rhythms and soulful choir chants.<br /><br />You could bother to shuffle the order of these thematically similar tunes, and it would not severely disrupt the records genuinely magical flow. This is precisely the thing that I was trying to describe when I started off this comment, the wonderfully satisfying consistency of its complex, eclectic sounds. The sublime unity of this inspired collection of faux American classics is Exile's defining quality. There are no weak moments, no sharp turns, no sudden peaks or plodding valleys. It all gels into a prolonged, hand clapping, jug blowing, whistle tooting good tyme, with everyone blithely smiling through their few remaining well worn, tobacco stained teeth. Countrified sounds at a countrified pace, done right. Real right.<br /><br />However, the problem with the 2010 reissue is the ridiculously over tweaked, over cleaned remastering. I have the mid 90s remastered \\"collectors\\" edition and the sound on that one is much closer to the original albums gritty, grimy texture, with the vocals usually sitting comfortably way back in the mix. This latest remaster pushes the voices way up front, and strips out much of the hazy, smoky ambiance in the process. The original didn't need this particular kind of help. Matter of fact, it didn't need any help of any kind. So make the effort to track down the better remastered version, or even the original cd release from the 80's which, as bad as that one is, is still truer in spirit to the original albums than this new \\"improved\\" financially motivated, cynical mistake.acco stained teeth.

B0010VD7EO|5.0|This album should be played on repeat. Catchy beats and grooves had me and my husband bopping our heads through out. Definitely uplifting if you are getting ready to go out and party!
0307593525|5.0|I have never had a cookbook that I just couldn't turn to the page of the desired recipe and begin.  This cookbook is a must read from page one before beginning to whip up those delightful French dishes.  If you don't do this, then the recipe has a great chance of failing.  It is easy to read and very informative.  I won't say that I will make all the recipes but I will use it when a definite change for my guests is needed.  I love to cook so this book is a definite addition to my collection.
B002O1XIN4|5.0|To be quite honest with you, the only thing I could manage to say after listening to this album is in fact \\"Guh\\". Amazing was not a good enough description nor was straight up bad-ass so \\"Guh\\" was all I could come up with. This album packs as much punch as any screamo, metalcore, an post-hardcore band can have and then managed to one up the rest.     Post-Hardcore with techno influence. Enough said.     Listen to The Final Episode once through and then again because it will be that good.    Give this album a shot. The listener will not be disappointed in any way, shape, or form.
B0039TD7RC|3.0|This is the third version of \\"Exile...\\" that I have paid for.  The initial double LP version cemented the collection as classic Stones and has yet to be surpassed by them.  The second version was Virgin's CD release which was shoddy in it's packaging (but it at least has a jewel box-like case to cover the cheap cardboard cover and it includes miniature versions of the postcards that accompanied the LP release.)  Virgin's release remains the best of the lot.  This new \\"remastered\\" package is notable only because of the newly-released old songs.  The songs from the original release are uniformly a second or 2 shorter here than on earlier versions.  Since the Stones haven't made music this meaningful in many years, reminders of their former potent rock and roll are welcome reminders of why they were once considered the world's greatest band.  That Mick, Keith and company continue to plumb their not insubstantial well of oldies is not entirely a bad thing when gems like those found on disk 2 here become available, but I have paid for this album for the last time.  Still, if you can sell a sucker like me the same product 3 times, you've obviously established a bond of some sort with the fan base.  I miss the urgent, fascinating band that the Stones once were but I do admire their business instincts.
1400052173|5.0|I read a blurp on Rebecca Skloot's book about Hela in a mag that someone had carelessly tossed on my desk. Vaguely remembered the word \\"Hela\\" from biology class many years ago. The article immediately peaked my interest and I placed my order. The fact that this woman's cells are as old as me sounded a bit fantastical. But the research the author cites caused that thought to go in the trash bin. An easy read for anyone who wants to know about medical research, what costs are involved, and the huge impact on society in the 20th century.   I do think that the family should have some compensation because these cells have been the only ones (per the book) that are still consistently being used in research.  Loved it! Wish I'd had this for biomedical ethics class.
0307388921|5.0|Chuck Palahnuik is an extremly gifted writer. Without a doubt,a great writer for the anti-establishment. His characters are unforgettable and his prose speaks to the everyday person, not just the elite. Even if a person hates reading, it is hard to hate Palahniuk. None of the elments that makes his writing absolutely sublime are missing in Choke. His characters Paula Marshall, Denny, Victor Maninci, and Ida Mancini are wonderfully crazy and without a doubt, completely unforgetable. It also makes you realize that maybe your parents did not do such a horrible job at raising you. Maybe you're not so crazy afterall. The reader might think Victor can find a better scam than to let rich patrons at high end restaurants believe they are saving his life when he pretends to choke on a piece of food. Then later he receives checks from the rich patrons because they are so happy they saved his life. He has to pay for his mother's hospital bills. Therefore, he should have came up with a better scam along the way. But I think Palahniuk did that on purpose in order to make fun of human nature. Palahniuk is great for anybody that loves a good satire. He is up there with Jonathan Swift and Mark Twain. But unlike the other two writers, he writes for anybody that can pick up a book and turn the pages. And the pages do turn fast with this excellent piece of work. I still like Fight Club more. But not by much.
B0039ZF8D2|2.0|I simply don't like this collabo. Maybe a few songs touched me but take Nas' flow on a different harder beat and maybe it would be better? Nas is a hip hop legend and being part Jamaican myself I was really looking forward to this release. Sadly the production is very lackluster and forgettable in my opinion. It isn't that Damian is bad but I don't think the chemistry is there for the two on this album. It was a nice attempt but this one will be forgotten to me. Hey to each there own though. Many reviews here that I'm seeing thoroughly enjoy it giving it 5 stars. Just not my bag and yes I'm a very open minded person when it comes to genres of music. Maybe next time?    UPDATE 5/22: yeah...still not feeling this album. I tried it again and to me it's not very good.  Compared to other reggae I listen to and also not a big fan of the Marley sound anyhow this just isn't for me. I go for more of the harder dancehall/mixtape stuff. This album imo has no pulse to keep me tuned in. Nice idea/effort though.
B001AQR39O|5.0|I became an instant fan of Californication when it first appeared almost three years ago. I loved each and every episode. I always thought the episodes went by too fast and I couldn't wait until next week to see the newest one. Then I went broke and lost Sho Time. I waited what seemed like forever on end to be able to buy the second season on DVD. And I was not the least bit disappointed. I will admit, I was worried about that within the first two episodes. It is sad to say this, but Californication is not funny unless Hank is completely self destructive and his life is in the toilet. As his life was going down the toilet once again, I found the episodes to be more and more funnier than the last one. Hank is such a crude a hole. I loved the characters and dialouge. And of course I loved all the crazy misadventures he went through. But what makes the show so great is beneath the sex addiction, crude behavior, less than tactful moments, and the drinking/drug use, Hank is a good, sweet guy. He just uses his cynism so people don't know he is actually a very vulnerable person. I love the writing in this show. I can't wait until I can buy Season Three.

B002VECMAE|4.0|Ewan McGregor plays newspaper reporter Bob Wilton who gets divorced and tries to prove himself to his ex-wife by going to Iraq as a war correspondent.  One of his last assignments prior to his marital debacle was an interview with a man who claimed to be part of a special army unit that was training in paranormal techniques.  When Wilton arrives in the Middle East he runs into Lyn Cassidy (George Clooney) a member of the secret unit referred to by his earlier interviewee.  Wilton pairs with Cassidy, and as the two progress on their journey, we are never quite sure if Cassidy is crazy or if there really was such a secret unit.  Wilton is good as the distraught, low-self esteem reporter and ex-husband whose fate seems to turn worse at every turn.  Clooney is excellent as the intense, paranormal ex-soldier.    Up until the conclusion, the movie playfully engages the viewer with its quirky plot and the interaction and growing understanding and friendship between Wilton and Cassidy.  There is also a general anti-war theme that runs through the movie, although it is appropriately implicit and not overdone.  The final scenes, however, which are supposed to climax in some sort of joyful redemption, don't work, and leave the viewer with a bad after taste.

B0009S2T0M|5.0|Fantastic movie that surprises you at every turn. If you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for? There's a reason Spielberg wanted to remake this, but there's no need. It's perfect as is. The hammer sequence is jaw-droppingly cool, and this DVD is loaded (look for the 3-disc tin version though, it's out of print but a must own).
B003A060K6|5.0|This really is one of the best releases of '10 thus far. I didn't know much about Caribou before hearing this and I must say I'm quite impressed. This is one of the most consistently interesting and melodic dance releases in recent memory. The other reviewers seem to think this is one of his weaker efforts. If that's true, his good stuff must be really mind-blowing.

0439023491|5.0|It is better late than never. That is what I felt when I was reading this book. Instead of the usual annoyance that I should have place it on top priority above others. Ok, I have a lot of favorite books / series but after the intensity of what is written here, I actually forgot the rest of my favorite book. Well... until now, I was glad that Spirit Bound is out and makes up for waiting for Mockingjay to be release later this year.<br /><br />Katniss and Peeta is back, still pretending that they are a couple, still the Capitol's puppet. But after much threatening and whispers of a rebellion. Katniss & Peeta together with the other victors of each District found themselves playing Hunger Games again.This time it was special since this is the 75th year of the Games, one of the Quarter Quell.  The horrors of last year's Games came haunting Katniss once again. But she can't do anything, if she wants her family and Gale's and Peeta's to survive she would have to play President Snow's game.<br /><br />I am not sure if the scenes that happened in this year's Game was much darker or not compared to the Hunger Games? There was clearly something brewing when the Capital replaced the head Peacekeeper at Katniss's District, and most especially Cinna's sacrifice. And then the alliance happened, sure there were vicious and disturbing things that happened but I did not cringe as much. I love the plot, the writing and how everything pans out. But what's frustrating? The ending of course. Nope its not bad, it was the perfect cliffhanger. So I did what I always do, I let out an impressive slew of curses, silently though, since I read this last bit of info during my lunch break.<br /><br />I am not too much of a Team \\"anyone\\" at the moment. Gale is with a disadvantage at the moment. Peeta had a huge chunk of story ahead of him. He is an awesome painter, baker, liar and speaker. Props! when he did that announcement while being interviewed by Caesar, and he is always so sweet, so sensitive yet Gale seems to be in another level, maybe because Katniss speaks highly of him? or maybe because she seems to be perfect for each other, since they can both defend themselves and had been friends for so very long? I don't know, if he gets more spotlight on the next book I might be able to pick a Team...<br /><br />How about you, on whose team are you on?ive yet Gale seems to be in another level, maybe because Katniss speaks highly of him? or maybe because she seems to be perfect for each other, since they can both defend themselves and had been friends for so very long?

1439163855|5.0|This book(and the movie) were so much better than what you thought it would be when picking up the book to read it. The story was not just about children but about life philosophically and literally. I do not read a lot of books but I am glad I took the time to read this particular one. Jodi Picoult did a great job and without giving away anything, you will enjoy this fact based story so much.

0440243688|5.0|Who needs an army with Jack Reacher around? This ex-army MP can put down any number of well-trained assassins. And amazingly, I believe it. Because I want to. Reacher is the ultimate tough guy, with a mind that never stops assessing, an eye that misses nothing and fighting skills that never fail.<br /><br />The opening scene is a masterpiece of suspense writing. Reacher is riding the 6 train in Manhattan at two in the morning and thinks he's spotted a suicide bomber. What happens next will eventually embroil him with the New York City police, the FBI, the Department of Defense, Homeland Security, a likeable politician with a top secret past and a very scary terrorist unit led by a \\"babe.\\"<br /><br />Reacher has no cell phone, no address, no luggage, no plans. Since leaving the military, he just wanders around, living cheaply, buying cheap new clothes and trashing his old clothes whenever he needs to change. He has just enough money in the bank to go where he pleases and be gone tomorrow. Big, tall and brawny, Reacher can't hide, so he's honed lots of other survival skills.<br /><br />The subway scenes are my favorite. It seems Reacher once spent eight stops on the 6 train sitting next to a crazy person obsessed with the New York subways. This person had an encyclopedic knowledge of the features of every model, and Reacher, the eternal student, absorbed it all. It comes in handy as Reacher evades his pursuers all around Manhattan.<br /><br />The denouement of Gone Tomorrow was so intense, it gave me the shakes. I had to eat some chocolate to calm down. I've read most of the Jack Reacher novels and loved them, but this may be the best yet.
B000NY85B4|5.0|Stunning in its prose, insightful in content, and ambitious in its goal:  to show the different ways that women connect to women, women's connection to literature, and what empowers women and what makes women feel trapped.  All of this from a male author. Simply amazing. Gorgeous and gutwrenching, it moves effortlessly from Virginia Woolf at the peak of her literary powers, to a woman captivated by Woolf's novel, to a modern woman whose own life parallels Woolf's life and novel. A must-read for every woman haunted by her choices, which means just about all of us, doesn't it?  You will devour this book in a matter of hours, but it will consume your soul for days, weeks, years to come.
B0018BB20W|5.0|I have been listening to all types of music since I was a little boy.    This is one of the greatest albums and pieces of music ever created.    I would rate this as one of the 10 best albums EVER!      What a concept - the Day comes alive with Dawn followed by Peak Hour and the unforgettable Tuesday Afternoon.    How can you possibly top the majesty of \\"Nights in White Satin\\"!    The re-mastering was well worth the purchase of this CD - this is a must for every serious music collector and fan!
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|I've been fascinated with Janelle Monae's voice ever since I first heard her on the Purple Ribbon Compilation in 2005[[ASIN:B000B66PIO Got Purp?, Vol. 2]].  She was just too funky on the two songs she had on that cd.  Those songs had people anticipating her album back then.  The next time I heard her was on the legendary Outkast's Idlewild cd.  She along with singer Scar (whatever happened to him?) continued to fascinate and again had me and other people eagerly awaiting a release.    Fast Forward to 2008 and as the Purple Ribbon label becomes obsolete, Janelle is picked up by none other than Diddy and Bad Boy Records.  After signing Janelle, Diddy hailed it as one of the most important signings of his career.  Metropolis-The Chase Suite EP was soon released after and it was evident that Bad Boy had not yet figured out what to do with Janelle Monae as it was a quiet release without a single and zero promotion, but people that knew quickly jumped on it.    Enter the Arch-Android.  I was pretty much unaware that Janelle Monae was dropping a new album up until the single Tightrope ft. Big Boi was released.  That song embodies what the entire cd is about.  Moving beat, great vocals, originality, effortless performance, skill, talent.  You can hear the Dungeon Family influence, you can hear the Erykah Badu, heck you can hear plenty of influences but she is a uniquely original artist.    Janelle Monae's Arch Android is one of those albums that gets you excited about music's capabilities.  She effortlessly blends these sounds and influences together to create one cohesive piece.  Yet each song stands on its own.  She is so versatile and talented that she can alter her voice (no auto-tune) and make it sound lovely every time.  Faint background vocals, screams, whispers, wailing, and flat out SANGING is all present.  For proof, the vocal stylings of Oh Maker and then directly after it is Cold War.  That's when you know she's amazing.   Vocally, she can go toe to toe with anybody out there.    Creatively, Janelle is on a whole other level.  Couple that with the talent to match, Diddy backing her, as well as being an outstanding performer (youtube her) it's a complete mystery why she isn't a mega-star already.  After all many have jocked her style and become supremely successful because of it (no names).  However Janelle can adapt and create a completely different style of music and fashion that will once again innovate and inspire other artists.    Arch-Android is surely and easily one of the best albums released this year. As a debut album (Metropolis was an EP), this is on the upper echelon of debuts in the past decade.  Janelle Monae is one of the most important and eclectic artists to emerge in quite a while and because of that I fear that she is way ahead of her time.    You shouldn't let that deter you though because Arch-Android is phenomenal and exceptional.  Janelle takes us on a magical journey and long after the cd is over you'll be wanting more.  If you're ready for Arch-Android then I fully suggest purchasing this album.  You won't be disappointed.
B0018LMZOO|4.0|I purchased this CD after seeing the Moody Blues in concert, Count Basie Theater, Red Bank, NJ in March 2010.    I have all the Moody Blues albums on vinyl, so I was very impressed with the quality after the re-mastering.  Nice to hear some great old music once again. Really miss Mike Pinder as a member of the group - he added a lot of soul and depth.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|This album puts the word fusion front and center. It combines the best elements of hip-hop with those from reggae and is brought to us, special delivery by Nas and Damian! I have made one listen thru and am completely satisfied with each track, so rare for albums put out now. The production is clearly high-quality, the seamless flow between Nas and Damian is undeniable, and I have yet to delve into the lyrics but what I've heard so far, shows us the promise of hip-hop, the voice to speak for those that have none. You won't find the ice, the whips, and the ladies on these flows. I'm so relieved! Great CD, need more of these type of collaborations, oh forgot to mention, killer voices and talent on the album, like Joss Stone and Dennis Brown. Stop reading...go get it, you will not be disappointed!

One day in their world, our world advances 100 years. Great fantasy film,escape your every day life in it.
B003F3NEBG|4.0|First thing first:  The adaptation itself is a classic, the best filmed version of this often-filmed novel.  And the Blu-Ray release shows off the Super 16mm photography in ways never before possible.  It is like seeing it again for the first time - only it never looked this good back then.  But this \\"new\\" disc has EXACTLY the same contents as the \\"old\\" Blu-Ray release.     In 2009 the BBC undertook a major restoration of 1995 Colin Firth/Jennifer Ehle \\"Pride & Prejudice\\".  They went back to the original camera negatives to create a new hi-def master that was released on Blu-Ray in the spring of 2009.      In 2010 they took the same hi-def master and downconverted it to use for a new widescreen standard-def DVD release, adding some of the supplements created for the 2009 Blu-Ray version and creating new cover art to distinguish this release from previous DVD versions.    At the same time they decided to re-issue the 2009 using the same cover art as the new SD-DVD version.  As far as I can tell, the packaging (and the SKU #) is the ONLY difference between the \\"new\\" 2010 2-disc Blu-Ray set and the \\"old\\" 2009 2-disc Blu-Ray set. Well, that and the price.  As of May 19, 2010, as I'm writing this review, Amazon is selling the \\"new\\" version for $35.49, while you can still buy the \\"old\\" version - with identical disc contents but a different cover - for $23.99.  BTW, the listing of the aspect ratio for this release as 1.33:1 is simply an error.  This mistake appeared in the specifications on the A&E site when they first announced the U.S. release of the set, even though the description said \\"widescreen\\" and the video clip provided (a \\"before and after\\" demo from the restoration documentary originally included on the 2009 version) was obviously in widescreen.     So unless you really like the new cover art, and I'll grant you the old version had too much Colin and not enough Jennifer, I'd suggest you save the $11.50 and buy the old set while supplies last.

B000002B30|4.0|'Greatest Hits' was Springsteen's first hits collection, released in the mid 90's and covering his most commercially successful period. It contains most of his big hits and radio favourites from the mid-70's to the early 90's, plus a couple of new and re-released songs. It's a pretty good collection, but I feel the album is not quite sure what it wants to be. Is it supposed to appeal to the very casual fan who only wants the big hits, or to the die-hards looking for fan favourites and rare tracks? While the album does contain most of what everyone will want to hear, I was a bit surprised at a few of the omissions, as well as one or two of the inclusions.    Inevitably the collection is dominated by the commercially successful singles: 'Born To Run', 'The River', 'Hungry Heart', 'Born In The USA', 'Dancing In The Dark', 'My Hometown', 'Glory Days', 'Brilliant Disguise', 'Streets Of Philadelphia'. No arguing with these tracks, as they are some of the best examples of Springsteen's ability to tell personal stories within a variety of pop/rock formats. This does mean that some of his darker, less accessible albums ('Darkness...', 'Nebraska') are sparsely represented, and it's a pity that none of the stuff from his first two albums made it. His version of 'Blinded By The Light' would have been a great inclusion. It's also surprising that a couple of pretty big hits miss out as well....I'd have thought 'Tunnel Of Love', 'Cover Me' and 'I'm On Fire' would get a place on the album.    Instead, the album provides some fodder for die-hard fans by including four new songs. 'Secret Garden' and 'Blood Brothers' are fairly subdued, acoustic songs in the mould of his 90's work, whereas 'This Hard Land' and 'Murder Incorporated' were 'Born In The USA' holdovers, and they sound like it. The latter in particular has apparently become a cult fan favourite, so it's fair enough to include that one. But I'm not sure the album needed FOUR new songs, especially considering the more well-known songs that are missing. If you're going to include that many new tracks, you might as well go the whole way and make a double album specifically targeted at the dedicated fans (i.e. 'The Essential Bruce Springsteen'). This album seems more designed for casual fans, so it was perhaps a mistake for these new songs to elbow out actual hits.     Perhaps the album is just a victim of Springsteen's own success. He had so many big hits and memorable songs that even a generous 18-track collection like this one can't quite do justice to every aspect of his career. Still, it's a pretty good collection that covers two decades of Springsteen's career, and despite its flaws it does still contain a hell of a lot of great music.
B003LFLOOW|1.0|EDIT: I see this review is not very helpful (2/7) - It is a review of purchasing the AVATAR movie for Download & On-Demand.  Not a review of AVATAR itself which is awesome 5/5 stars!  It was originally posted under a separate product listing that was AVATAR on-demand - but that was deleted and this was transferred to the DVD product listing.    I have tried to watch this on Demand & paid again to download a version to the Amazon Unbox player.  Both versions are very sub-par quality way below a normal DVD 480p widescreen.  Also their appears to be some aspect ratio distortion; not 100% sure about this but some heads are about 4x as tall as they are wide and the planet in the opening scene is highly elliptical. The downloaded version is a total of 3.26 gb in size - which is your first hint that Amazon has used some very high compression rates to downsize the movie.  This is below standard DVD 480p quality - extremely blurry no fine edges.  Also, my version with my Unbox player only plays in stereo.  I guess I was expecting a 1080p version with 5.1 surround or even a 720p quality with 5.1 at a minimum.  Do not waste your money on the Amazon rental - they simply don't have it together yet.  I have a window 7 media center PC with a HDMI cable to my TV and I regularly watch high def tv and 5.1 surround on my current set-up.

006145205X|3.0|Wow! A zoologist who was editor of The Economist argues for a  bright future but also warns about an organizational disease (parasitism) that may be the seeds of its destruction...Namely \\"parasitic organizational diseases\\" also cited by people like Jared Diamond (also a zoologist) in his book: The Collapse of Civilizations who suggests that the decline and collapse of civilization is due to terminal \\"diseases\\" that, ultimately,  metastasize and destroy the civilization....A recent example was cited on a National Geographic special that explored abandoned (failed) Inca cities ... Anthropologists postulated that the Inca priestly class, where kings could have as many wives and children as possible, produced an increasing number of  \\"royal\\" offspring, all of whom were princes and princesses...and who didn't have to produce anything  yet  had  special consumption opportunites because of their royal lineage....basically the \\"Inca\\" hive became too top heavy with not enough \\"lowly\\" worker  bees to support the culture....Diamond cited the environmental collapse of the Easter Island culture, a group of people who cut down all the trees to build the large stone heads that kept getting bigger and bigger as each \\"king\\" wanted his head to be larger than his predecessors....     (Note: it was mentioned in the Nat. Geographic special that near the end of the Inca civilization was a \\"rule\\" that that a royal highway to a temple could only be trod upon  by \\"royalty\\" and the lowly people who built the temples and grew the corn and beans....were forbidden to even walk on the \\"royal\\" street)     Matt Ridley, The Rational Optimist, states:    \\"Empires bought stability at the price of creating a parasitic court; monotheistic religions bought social cohesion at the expense of a parasitic priestly class; nationalism bought power at the expense of a parasitic military; socialism bought equality at the price of a parasitic bureaucracy; capitalism bought efficiency at the price of parasitic financiers.\\"      To me Ridley's \\"Bright Future\\" scenario is like a doctor telling a person with a fatal disease that  they have a \\"bright future\\"..... namely that they they are going to heaven.   And...according to Ridley, there is no cure...capitalism, communism, socialism, fascism, anarchism, militarism come at \\"a price\\" like the price of birth is death...[[ASIN:006145205X The Rational Optimist: How Prosperity Evolves]]
B0021L8V1G|5.0|When I was a young boy I played with all sorts of action figures, GI Joes and Transformers the most.  Later as a young teen I got my first job at a comic book store.  What I often thought of was a collaboration of my favorites.  As Hollywood has slowly embraced a genre specifically steered towards the Comic-Con crowd I have looked on with great interest.  Having loved the original Iron Man, I can say unequivocally that Iron Man 2 is awesome in every way.<br /><br />The sequel deals quite a bit with the palladium and arc reactor technology behind Iron Man, and how that technology adversely affects Tony Stark (Downey, Jr.).  As the U.S. government, via LTC James Rhodes (Cheadle) demands access to the design, use, and replication of Iron Man's scientific advancements - something Stark refuses - the man behind the mask must face not only his government and his mortality, but also a competing industrialist, the nefarious Justin Hammer (Rockwell), and the Russian villain Ivan \\"Whiplash\\" Vanko (Rourke), who has reverse engineered Iron Man's arc reactor technology (adding weapons along the way) to satisfy a family vendetta.  On top of all that Stark still has to be the hard-partying, scotch-pounding womanizer who must placate Pepper Potts (Paltrow) on a daily basis, ogle new assistant Natasha Romanoff (Johansson), and contemplate an affiliation with SHIELD - a top secret government organization led by front-man Nick Fury (Jackson).<br /><br />Some may say this movie fails because it lacks action.  And by \\"lacks action\\" most people mean \\"isn't Transformers 2.\\"  In my opinion, the more detailed storyline uncovering Stark's personal, psychological, and physical dilemmas is the essence of the flawed superhero, and avoiding the zeitgeist makes is superior to the bam, pow FX-heavy of Transformers 2, et al.  But when Iron Man 2 DID ratchet up the action - initially with a battle between Iron Man and Rhodes, but later in an epic Iron Man robot battle royal - it was edge the seat, floor rumbling, front row of the rollercoaster exciting.<br /><br />It should go without saying, but the incredible cast performs just as one would expect.  Downey, Jr. is the boisterous, swaggering Tony Stark personified, and Paltrow, whose smug attitude I typically loathe, is nearly perfect as Potts.  Rockwell and Jackson turn in inspired, albeit secondary efforts.  Johannson is minimally used, but serves her Matrix-esque purpose in a skin-tight outfit and awesome fight scene.  The scene stealer, however, is clearly Mickey Rourke.  The demented, evil look, the spot-on accent, the eccentricity is electric (pun intended).<br /><br />Great movie, succeeds where others have failed, builds upon the story perfectly, provides something for all audiences, and for me, it put the GI Joe into a Transformer costume.g, front row of the rollercoaster exciting.

B002WCLG3O|2.0|Short and sweet:  I was disappointed on many levels, and evidentally there are more female spartans than male according to the storyline.  Only cool thing was the reveiling of how the Arbiter came about, and maybe a few of the much too late CGI scenes.  Overall, rent if you MUST see it.
1906694176|5.0|This third installment of Stieg Larson's wonderful character's adventures will not disapoint fans of the first two books.  Lisbeth Salander the super hacker who has endured a lifetime of injustice gets her revenge on the system.  A fantastic must read.
B002ZRPQ5K|1.0|I share the sentiments in the other reviews.  Notably, I am a fan of \\"Perfect Symmetry\\" and the neo-80s synth doesn't bother me when it's applied to an incredible song like \\"Lovers are Losing\\" or \\"Black Burning Heart.\\"  I still think the title track is the best thing Keane, or virtually anyone, has produced in the last few years.  But, this EP is a terrible disappointment.  They are certainly experimenting, but the songwriting suffers.  I experienced the same letdown with an \\"experimental album\\" years ago when U2 put out \\"Zooropa.\\"  Even the one song strong enough to be a single, \\"Stop for a Minute\\" is just an average Keane song.  On this weak album, it stands out even more.  But, on their other albums, it would be the fourth or fifth strongest song.  I hope they find themselves soon, because they are wandering too much in the musical wilderness.
B00168OIOE|5.0|Let me start by saying this movie is hilarious. A film in hich the entire family can enjoy with a stellar cast. Billy Crystal alone makes this film worth it.  Even though this film came out before animated films were being made in High Definition Cameras; the transfer to Blu-Ray format is flawless compared with other transfers from regular DVD's to Blu-Ray films that i have seen from the same time this movie came out. Video is pure 1080P, literally lights up your entire screen with vivid brilliant colors and Sound is fabulous. You actually get to see many details from the characters you didn't even know were there from watching the original film.    My kids loved it. This Blu-Ray version of Monsters, Inc definitely scores an \\"A+\\" in my book.
B0012GMYUU|5.0|This disk proved to be a surprise. What is most evident is that it's not organic. The manifold manipulations in the recording of this album can be a bit off-putting at first. For a musician so grounded in the blues it's not what you would expect, such a patchwork of recorded effects co-mingled with guitar rifts. It's not the kind of album you'll be asking \\"who played the banjo on that cut?\\".Given a couple of listenings much more is revealed. This is a very cohesive and unique batch of music demonstrating what a creative talent Jeff Beck is. Recorded in 2001,I'm a little late getting to this, but we can see Beck's ahead of the curve, and good music is timeless. There are elements of rock and blues interwoven into a solid, powerful, inspired recording. And as a bonus, the great cover, the workingman's hands, likely those of Jeff Beck. Defying convention,\\"You Had It Coming\\" is an example of why Jeff Beck has chosen to make his own way in the world of music. For those who have a wide range of musical favorites, this one is worthy of your attention. It may take a few times through to grow on you as it did me.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|I was delighted with this movie and just fell in love with it! I figured I'd like it well enough because I like the main actors, but I never imagined how good it would be.    Zooey Deschannel is adorable and charming as Summer and plays her role well. Her character is engaging yet distant--definitely enigmatic--and it's easy to see why Joseph Gordon-Levitt's character, Tom fell in love with her. However, she is emotionally unavailable and Tom cannot understand why. It is a question that has concerned many of us. How can two people have a wonderful connection, yet only one of them falls in love? The film shows Tom's ups and downs as he thinks he's found \\"the one\\" and Summer seems perfect for him, yet always pushes him away. If you've been in this situation, you will love the characters yet feel the emotions of their situation deeply. I went from cracking up laughing to bawling. Sometimes I thought I'd need to stop the DVD because it was so reminiscent of real life. But, just like \\"real life,\\" I'm glad I went through it. It definitely gives you something to think about... how relationships work, why the perfect one is not really perfect, timing, and more. This is more than just a \\"chick flick.\\" It is an emotional and learning experience that I'd highly recommend for anyone who has ever experienced unrequited love.
B002Q9VPFM|5.0|I gotta say that I'm from Medellin, Colombia, and that when I went to watch this movie in theaters I had no idea what it was about.   It blew my mind!!!   What a great movie!   So of course I went online to find out more about it, downloaded it the comic and the animated comic, and love them even more! When I heard about the ultimate cut, I knew that I had to have this, and I don't regret it.   What a fantastic tale this is, and how well it was put on screen. I have no words to describe how perfectly this comic was made into a movie.   How fulfilling it is to think that there's still are companies who bet on projects like this.  I truly recommend that you buy this ultimate cut of Watchmen, like me, you won't regret it, not even a second!
B0001WANCM|5.0|Have you ever wondered what life would be like if you took the road less traveled? This movie reminds me so much of how baseball, an American pasttime, used to be with passion and not about money, that many had to leave it all behind to do other things, but died, wishing to finish the game, or died under other circumstances. James Earl Jones is amazing, and so is the unforgettable Ray Liotta. The most touching part is Kevin Costner seeing his father again after his father died. \\"If you build it, he will come,\\" a voice says to Kevin in the beginning in his farm corn field. He wants to discover who will come. Not really a spiritual movie, but it makes you have faith in God, if God tells you to do the rediculous, he will do the miraculous. Never Settle for anything less and make no regrets.

0812973992|5.0|Let the Great World Spin is a collection of stories. Did you know that? I did not. However, the stories are told from several different points of view, and although each character has a very distinct voice, the stories eventually collide with one another leaving the reader standing there, wondering who or what comes next.<br /><br />Something terrible happens, and as the chain of events unfold, we view the same event from different perspectives. Itfs as if the world is spinning in slow motion, and we are forced to look at the bits and pieces that are not normally noticed when time moves at a  more normal pace.<br /><br />Many of these characters are flawed. They are striving for something, and often find themselves on the outside looking in. As they observe the world around them, life as we know it, continues on. As I read this book, I was mesmerized by the authorfs ability to take me in and out of a characterfs head. One story is told from a prostitutefs point of view, and as I was reading her story, I felt what she was feeling, the frustration, the loss, the helplessness. It was a lonely place to be.<br /><br />I know I havenft said much about the plot, but as you can imagine, when something terrible happens, there is a downward spiral that takes place. As things come crashing to a halt, there is no place to go but up. This book is like that. We take the plunge into despair, visit with these characters awhile, and then wefre given a small glimpse of what lies ahead. To me, the the plot didnft really matter. I was so absorbed the the internal conflict within each character that plot was secondary to me.<br /><br />I love this book. I appreciate this book. I am in awe of this book.<br /><br />It has a quiet, understated quality to it that I wasnft expecting. The characters are complex and conflicted and even though some of them may not be the type of people Ifd be friendly with, I could relate to many of them. This is the type of book that you can re-read, and see  (and feel) something different each time you pick it up.<br /><br />I know for some readers, the varying perspective was a source of confusion at times, but once I figured out where the author was going, I had no problem with the different viewpoints.you pick it up.

0545140315|4.0|I found The Lonely Hearts Club by Elizabeth Eulberg, to be funny, witty, and a great read. What girl hasn't dated a jacka$$ and wanted to swear off men? Eulberg made having a broken heart seem like a good experience rather than a tragedy. Penny, the main character, gets her heart broken by her first boyfriend and starts The Lonely Hearts Club. She swears off dating and boys until she is out of high school. At first all her friends think she has lost it but slowly they come around. I love the embarrassing parents because I swear they have the funniest lines. I am sure some day our kids will say the same about Twilight fans (if they're not saying it already!). In the end The Lonely Hearts Club evolves into a group of girls who support each other. If you have a loser ex, or know of someone who does I recommend this book. It's a really fun read!

B003FFBFQA|5.0|The third volume was as satisfying as the first two. Larsson spent a little more time explaining the political history which provided the context for the trilogy, which occasionally bogged down the action, but, for me, this was adding cinema verite to noir, not a bad combo. My only problems with this book is that I couldn't do anything but read the entire weekend, and that people kept trying to steal the book from me.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|Yes we have been waiting a long time for this remaster. Yes, we all love the Rolling Stones. Yes many of us are even eyeing the \\"Super Deluxe\\" Edition even though we don't have a turntable for the vinyl.<br /><br />So why do we  \\"accept\\" poor packaging.  The lure of any \\"remaster\\" is the additional \\"stuff\\". Extended booklets with rare photos, dazzling insights into the time of the recording. Updates on who's where. These are as important as the final technical sound of the new recording<br /><br />The Stones have been remarkably dull in their remastering packaging. Case in point- Beggars Banquet.  What a hatchet job on one of the most interesting album covers of their career. Granted CD's do not leave a lot of room for \\"art\\" but the introduction of the digipack paper product has added a certain \\"something\\" to the feel of the final product.  Anything is an improvement on what was arguabley the end of rock art-The Cassette.<br /><br />When companies like Hipnosis gave us some of the finest art work regardless of what the end market was, to see what Beggars Banquet became in the remastered form was devasting to anyone who worked on the original piece.<br /><br />So with all of the touting and the anxious waiting like star struck teens (which we really still are- be honest. Remember how you felt when you first held the Beatles remasters?!) don't be disappointed when you open the new Exiles and go huh... Where's the....<br /><br />Hey it's only rock & roll<br /><br />[...]
B0000AC8N4|5.0|Dexter says it all!  His command of the tenor is amazing and his unique voice is instantly identifiable.  The sound that he produces is well focussed and in tune, but he can manipulate it in many ways.  His phrasings are musical and directed forward.  Players can learn a lot from his recordings.
B002RVZV9U|2.0|I think this was all about Jack White and how great he thinks he is. There was about 10 seconds spent on The Edge's sound, and Jimmy Page wondering around some old castle. Way too much time spent on silly Jack White montages. If you were hoping for some good jams, you will be severely disappointed.
B001PU8N0I|4.0|I couldn't rate this as a \\"5\\" because I just didn't find it as exciting or fulfilling as \\"Our Mutual Friend\\" --another Dickens' classic, which I absolutely love.  But Little Dorrit is a great film -- felt it was a little too slow moving and long though.  Also found it a bit too dark and didn't really figure out Mrs. Clennam's secret.    Great acting made this movie a good watch.  Very family friendly.
B00006AG5N|5.0|Music CD in great condition.  But somehow could not transport tunes into my ipod.  Perhaps CD is British made and therefore format different?  Anyway, good transaction.  Fast delivery.  Very happy with condition of CD.

Their second album sounded too much like the first and Astra was also a bore.  So years later I thought I'd buy this disc to see if they've aged into some great material.

1400052173|2.0|There is an iron-clad rule in journalism that reporters should never mix the process and difficulties of getting a story into the telling of it. There are many very obvious reasons for this. First among them is the reporter's process detracts from the story.  In fact the trouble that author has in running down the story is completely superfluous to the core story. About half of this book is a description of the ways and difficulties the author had in getting the story. It is a shame because it undermines a fascinating story and ruins the book.

Warning: if you have an ulcer or heart condition, read at your own risk!  I felt my muscles tense along with Katniss, and my heart was pounding quite often.<br /><br />Some criticized this book as just a rehash of the first.  I actually found the deja vu interesting, wondering how it would be different with the veteran players and whether they will cooperate in the way the Capitol wants.<br /><br />I find Katniss' naivete endearing.  She is naturally skeptical, and yet she herself is \\"pure,\\" never seeing the full scope of the evil and danger around her until it slaps her in the face.  This is a coming of age story.  She is discovering herself...and we get to experience it with her.  I find so many things to relate to in her personality.<br /><br />I am anxious to read Mockingjay!<br /><br />**This series is violent and has mature themes.

B001R4KQDE|5.0|When I took my wife to see the theatrical release of \\"Sin City,\\" she had never read any of the source material and the chronology confused her to the point of frustration.  I enthusiastically bought the Recut, Extended & Unrated DVD release and relished the ability to enjoy each story in its entirety, independent of the others--just as I can do as a reader of Frank Miller's trade paperbacks and graphic novel (\\"Family Values\\" is the only true GN in the collection, but that's for another forum!).  Finally, we recently upgraded to the Blu-ray edition and I persuaded her to revisit the movie in the uncut form...and she loved it!  The supplemental content is the same as the DVD release, but the feature really looks and sounds great in Hi-Def.    The bonus materials are among the finest I've ever seen, and I'm a bonus features junkie.  Perhaps the most interesting is \\"The Long Take,\\" in which the camera rolls throughout a scene directed by Quentin Tarantino and shows several different takes by actors Clive Owen and Benicio Del Toro, as well as conversations between takes.  Viewers get an unfiltered look at the craft of acting.  Another favorite is \\"10 Minute Cooking School,\\" in which Robert Rodriguez shows how to make a breakfast burrito from scratch--including the tortilla!
B003C5FMEE|4.0|To me, this album is what Miles Davis was reaching for, but couldn't quite attain with his 1992 \\"Do Bop\\" record (funked up-hip hop backbeats). Although difficult to define just what \\"it\\" is, its clear Trombone Shorty has IT. Only 21 years old while recording this album is clear that he has some growing to do, in terms of songwriting, composition, and skills as soloist..but its gonna be a fun ride! Especially considering he is making music of this quality, with so much fun in mind, and with a fresh sound..get this cd! I would 3 star this but the fact is modern jazz is so bland and stale; his efforts get him a 3 star, since there isn't that much to listen to in contemporary times.

B00337KM2S|4.0|Great film. Deserving of the Certified Fresh score on Rotten Tomatoes (which means MOST people who know what they're talking about regarding films think it was good.) I hadn't heard the idea of hiring an outside agency to do one's firing before this film. Seems more expensive than needed. Anyway, a simple but relatable story and wonderfully cast. I didn't think Clooney's character evolved as much as he could have, but he obviously did evolve (which you see at the end.) Some people who watch the film may miss the subtleness in which his character grows (the visual portrayal of the evolution is explained in the commentary, which is definitely worth watching/listening to.) And to say that the movie is boring is to also miss the subtleness of the development of the story/characters. One final thought: I think anyone of my generation (Gen X) and certainly later could easily see a future in which we get fired in this manner (in the end when Natalie is showing Ryan the, eh, call center.) Film score 4.25 out of 5.    Overall, the DVD is excellent. For a short second, I kind of wished there was a separate extras disc, but then I realized there didn't need to be. They have the teaser trailer as well as theatrical trailer (at minimum the DVD should have the theatrical trailer.) There is a short featurette \\"Shadowplay: Before the Story\\" that's about the company that did the opening titles (which were very well done.) The deleted scenes are probably worth the rental by themselves (if you saw this movie in theaters.) There is an extended sequence called \\"Omaha Montage\\" that is very good and quite interesting as it poses a kind of alternate leading-up-to-the ending. I understand why this sequence was cut (time and pacing of the film) and I agree, but I think it really works to show how much Ryan has evolved. Again, the commentary is very good, but I kind of felt like they would get a bit off track in comparison to what was going on on screen. DVD score 4. Overall Score 4. 5/18/10
B000LTAY1U|5.0|i bought a 1.5k swiss automatic watch,fancy with diamonds but the mechanism begun to pulverize i was able to see diminute particles on the inside of the glass after 1 month of use, i returned the watch and got this simple and reliable one and i love it !!<br />is precise as a atomic watch... jk it runs ok i timed with my computer and compared after a week and there was no difference at all so i did it for a month and it was about 2 seconds over<br /><br />I might get an other watch and leave this one for daily use I was hoping a bigger watch plus I miss my fancy ridiculous watch :(<br /><br />after wearing a big watch this one feels like a cable tie on my wrist make sure you check out the dimensions<br /><br />the thickness is great tho, the weight... you will forget you have it  at first the wrist band was a little bad... it irritated my skin with micro cuts so i took vengeance and cut those sharp melted wristband pieces away<br /><br />---------Update 2 years Later------------- bought this April 17 2010----------<br /><br />The watch timing is really bad, I took it to a jeweler for repair and said it need lubrication, and mentioned it seemed like it didn't got assembled right.<br />this can be noticed if the adjustment knob is really tight (it always was) the mechanism inside is the one causing this problem.<br />It should be able to get adjusted with a little bit more torque than when it need to spin when it is in lock position (all the way in)<br /><br />the watch stops for hours. other than maintaining this baby I still give it a go. I always get good compliments for it.<br /><br />I keep it on 5 stars because I am not lazy enough to cry about it. I actually took it for a couple days to the jeweler and now its like new. only paid 20 bucks for the service.
B003A060K6|5.0|I have been following Caribou for a couple years now. Although this album is much different from their previous releases, it is good as gold. Upbeat rhythm and excellent samples offer a very melodic soundscape. This is actually their first album that I fully appreciate from start to finish. My new favorite!!
B003183UCI|5.0|Anybody who calls themselves a Whovian really MUST have a Sonic Screwdriver.  There are several other versions out there, but who wouldn't want the one that can write invisibly and make NOISE.  Lots of fun for all ... unless you're a Dalek, of course.
B002ZG99G8|4.0|I have to admit that this movie was entertaining. The movie is based on a comic book, and the story seems to prepare us for the upcoming \\"The A-Team\\" adaptation. The movie has it's action packed moments and plenty of laugh-out loud moments also. Of all the leads in this movie, it was Chris Evans who stole the show and provided some comic moments in the movie.  In some scenes, you can almost predict when there will be a car blast, when someone will get shot and when the lead star will save the day. \\"The Losers\\" delivers about what you'd expect and has some tricks up its sleeve which makes it worth checking out.
0061914177|4.0|If you are going to read this book with your intellect, don't bother because, this book is about passion and how you can live your life with it.  It's about figuring out what floats your boat and just doing that.  A well known marketer gave me this book, so I had an advantage knowing it had value or it would not have been given to me.  This book promotes honesty with yourself and therefore everyone else, therefore we are encouraged to be transparent.<br /><br />Gary throws out a number of areas for growth if they match your passion.  Appendix A. in my opinion is worth the price of the book, I would gladly pay for a report: The 20 top tips to online success, so the rest of the book is free.  You are not buying a novel here, what I came away with was a sense of purpose and possibilities for me.  Gary encourages us to voice our authentic selves, to some people that is scary and promotes uncomfortable feelings.  you will have to decide for yourself if you want to be you

B0013ND30M|5.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />The Walt Disney Company's 1959 adaptation of \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" is the last truly great animated film from the studio's early brilliance.  It caps the first era of feature-length animation which began with Disney's \\"Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs\\" in style, with a simple story told through daring animation and creativity.<br /><br />With the voice talents of Mary Costa, Eleanor Audley, and Verna Felton, among many others, the movie's dynamic animation precedes the digital revolution in animation by at least three decades.  Yet, the available resources of the time are utilized so ingeniously that the movie is literally forty years ahead of its time.  It also boasts unique characters and a script which is not afraid to present its villainess as a purely evil demonic witch.<br /><br />The storyline is deceptively simple:  three benevolent fairies look after a princess, deep undercover because of a vengeful death curse at her christening.  Eleanor Audley's vocal work combined with frighteningly mature animation make the evil fairy Maleficent one of Disney's most potentially terrifying antagonists.  Her name itself is a stroke of genius:  a combination of the words \\"malevolent\\" and \\"magnificent.\\"<br /><br />Also featuring a great soundtrack comprised mostly of Tchaikovsky's \\"Sleeping Beauty Ballet,\\" and including the poetic \\"Once Upon A Dream,\\" Walt Disney's \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" is a superb film, animated or otherwise.

B00000JFV9|5.0|THIS SOUNDTRACK TO ME IS THE GREATEST SOUNDTRACK EVER, PERIOD.  I REMEMBER AS A LITTLE \\"G\\"(MAYBE AROUND 2 OR 3)STARING AT THE ALBUM COVER.  I STARED AT IT FOR QUITE SOME TIME. MY MOM TOLD ME THAT ME, MY FATHER AND HER SAW THE MOVIE.  I DON'T REMEMBER SEEING IT(DIDN'T MISS ANYTHING) I GOT TO SEE THE MOVIE 10 YEARS AGO AND THE SOUNDTRACK BLOWS THE MOVIE OUT OF THE WATER.  THE ONLY MOVIES THAT WERE GOOD AND HAD GOOD SOUNDTRACKS WERE \\"CAR WASH\\"AND \\"NEW JACK CITY\\".  HELL, THE LINER NOTES ARE BETTER THAN THE MOVIE!!  I THINK CURTIS DID A GREAT JOB OF SPEAKING THROUGH SONG THE SENTIMENTS OF THE MAIN CHARACTERS IN THE FILM.  LIKE HE DID A MASTERFUL JOB OF ARTICULATING GEORGIA'S FEELINGS ABOUT PRIEST IN \\"GIVE ME YOUR LOVE\\".  THE SING-SONG NURSERY RHYMES OF \\"PUSHERMAN\\" WAS VERY SLICK AND VERY CLEVER(NO ONE COULD HAVE DONE IT ANY BETTER).  THE ONLY LITTLE GRIPE I HAVE IS THAT \\"JUNKIE CHASE\\" IS TOO SHORT.  THE MUSIC JUST GRIPS YOU THEN LEAVES YOU HANGING.  IT GIVES A GOOD ADRENALINE RUSH.  HIS SIGNATURE SONG THAT HE WILL FOREVER BE KNOWN FOR, \\"SUPERFLY\\",DIDN'T DO ANY BETTER THAN #5 ON THE BLACK CHART(NOW KNOWN AS R&B CHARTS).  I WAS VERY SURPRISED, AND I'M A LITTLE MAD, TOO BECAUSE IT BEAUTIFULLY CONVEYS LIFE AS A BLACK MAN IN URBAN AMERICA.  TO MY KNOWLEDGE, CURTIS LEE MAYFIELD NEVER WON A GRAMMY(HE DESERVEDLY RECEIVED A LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD)FOR THIS LANDMARK SOUNDTRACK.  THIS IS A SHAME.  FUNNY HOW WE DON'T KNOW WHAT WE HAVE UNTIL WE LOSE IT.  BUT SUPERFLY NOT ONLY RANKS AS THE BEST DAMN SOUNDTRACK, IT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS OF ANY GENRE, PERIOD.  THIS IS MY FOURTH COPY(THE OTHER 3 I HAD WAS EITHER LOST OR STOLEN) OF THIS CD AND I SOLEMNLY SWEAR THAT I WILL GUARD IT WITH MY LIFE.  MAY THE LORD(AHAYAH)BLESS AND REST BROTHER CURTIS' BEAUTIFUL SOUL.  PEACE.
B000127LW2|4.0|I'll admit that I'm not a big Star Trek fan, but there's something about the mix of characters and the premise of trying to get home that draws me to Voyager.  Yes, it's a bit campy and predictable at times, with a moral compass that's just a bit too straight--with way too much exposition, which has become a trait of the Star Trek franchise--but that's what makes for good escapist television.  And Season One delivers on that promise of good television, with some interesting extras on the DVD set.  Unfortunately, the season isn't long enough to justify such an expensive price; the 5 extras also do not make up for a lack of shows in the shortened first season.  (The price for all the Star Trek shows, as well as X-Files, makes me wonder if there's some sort of attack on sci-fi fans, whom studio executives think will pay through the nose to get the DVDs.)  That's why I held back a star. If you can get the DVD for about $19.95, then it's worth it--but closer to $50?  The Phage has eaten away your brain.
B00104CIA0|5.0|When the single Magic Fly arrived in the UK in 1977 it was a massive hit for me.  Synthesizer sounds of the European disco variety is one way to describe it.  The title track is truely fantastic, as are Fasten Seat Belt, Tango In Space, Ballard For Space Lovers and Flying Nightmare.  The vocal Carry On, Turn Me On is not much to my taste, however Velvet Rape is OK.   Space went on make Deliverence, also 1977, Just Blue from 1978 is included in the 7 bonus tracks and finally Deeper Zone from 1980.  All have their high moments, but perhaps the best are Magic Fly and Deliverence.
B002VGXM9C|5.0|I just finished up the first book in the Percy Jackson Series, The Lightning Thief. I have heard nothing but great things about this book and I would have to say that it didn't disappoint.    There were a few things I loved about this book. The first one being the style in which it was written. I love that it was a first person point of view. You were hearing directly from Percy throughout the whole book. I love when authors do that. The other thing that I loved was all of the background and references to the mythological gods. It was great to have that since I'm not exactly an expert in that field and would have had a hard time following along if there had not been the background on them.    Overall, I would give this book a 5/5. It was a page turner that had plenty of drama and suspense to keep me up into the wee hours of the morning reading it. To be honest, I haven't gotten into a book as much as I did this one in a long time. It was refreshing and I can't wait to read the next one.

1567184855|5.0|Journey of Souls is really one of those quintessential books every person interested in the spiritual/metaphysical side of personal growth should read. There are lots of books out there that describe the afterlife, but, well, this one is the best I've seen by far. It describes everything in such detail, and all of the details resonate, at least for me, on a very deep 'oh yeah!' soul level.<br /><br />Soul clusters (your soul family). Dying and being reborn. Soul Contracts. Lessons. Planning of your lives. Guides. Renewal and healing. It's all in there, and very well done. While hypnotizing people to help them recall their past lives, the author 'accidentally' stumbled on a third realm between now and then - there's a life between lives. He was able to ask these people very specific questions about what they experienced while on the other side after they died in their past life, and before they were born into their current one.<br /><br />There is a sequel out there, [[ASIN:1567184995 Destiny of Souls: New Case Studies of Life Between Lives]]...but really, I don't recommend it. I have it, but it's pretty boring - just kinda milking the success of the first book was the feel I got from it. This book's been out for quite a long time, so you should be able to find it at your local library, or used online. Enjoy! :D

I kid!<br />& the lovely, & fantastica Erica Gimble, who played the enigmatic, & unstopable Coco H.<br /><br />But other then those two songs, the first ruined by the strange game Announcer, as I said, really not your best bet.<br />But continue to read my review any way, cause it's got more info for you about more Fame items, that have been omitted, & never to be seen, in they're Dvd form to the American Fame fans, by various parties, that decided for us, what America should, & shouldn't get to have. & that's un American Folks, no matter how cheesy our shows future Seasons got, just look at ol Monkees eps, Fame wasn't even that bad in the end. Yet Sappy Davey eps made it through the Censore board then???<br /><br />But back to Cds, I'm sorry, but I have to recommend Ultimate more...<br /><br />I am a die hard, Fame friend, (just in case that didn't come across)& Proud of it too!, & I'm glad for the interest to return to us, where it Ultimately belongs, [not in Europe alone.] where our show was sadly sent, after MGM cancelled it, after only 2 seasons.<br /><br />But Reality check: It didn't end after that.

If the second movie Debby Alan did, didn't come out, I don't think Seasons 1- 2 of our show would have.<br /><br />All parties would benefit from the complete selling of the Show Seasons 1-6 as is, only right, all the die hard Fame Fans from USA, would finally be given our due, & Justice resoluted, to undo the damage done long time ago, by MGM.

B002M2T1UO|2.0|If you're looking at the reviews for this show then you probably are already a fan and know the show is great. This review is about the product set.    Overall, it's very poor in terms of disc protection. This set comes with an outer plastic sleeve which protects the book that houses all the discs. The print job, artwork, and paper it is printed on are all very good and adds a lot to the set but that is where the good ends.    Each page houses two discs which are stuffed in between the page. Each disc is \\"protected\\" by a paper sleeve which covers the front and back of the disc.    These by themselves wouldn't be so bad but whoever manufactured this set hired some real apes to put them in there. Several of the discs I received were badly scratched while others had torn paper sleeves. Most of the discs had debris stuck to them. Some of the discs were hard to get out because the apes who put them in there shoved them as hard as they could.     My suggestion is this: If you are really a huge fan of the series, consider paying more for each individual season set that has its own plastic case. Before this set, I would buy all my TV shows on those sets instead of the big \\"collector's package\\" even though they cost more. Amazon had this on a gold box deal which made me go with this. Typically these collector's sets are poor quality and are just a way for the manufacturer to save money. \\"Less plastic cases, more penny paper, and who cares about quality these days?\\" - Manager of the Factory    If you get defectives, it's a lot easier to send back just one season rather than an entire collection and have a better chance of getting a good set.     If you do decide to go with this set, do yourself a favor and inspect every disc first hand and then place them in a disc wallet for protection. Otherwise after years of viewing, your set will be trashed.      Such a shame that these collection sets are always worse off than the individual seasons.
B00333NCTM|5.0|I loved this book! It was the funniest, most genuine heartfelt auto-biography I have ever read. It was so up-beat, he never had anything bad to say about any of the other people in his life. Some of his story's were so funny I read them out loud to my husband. It was well written, easy to follow and I loved the personal pictures! Strongly recommend this book, even if you are not an Ozzy fan.
B00275EGX8|1.0|Do not bother with this film, especially if you are on active duty somewhere in the world (thank you).  People like those that made this film, who have no direct experience in the military, much less with being ordered into combat, have no business writing about the very real and incomparable human truth of the experience.  His characters are pinups pasted onto a fantastical and sheltered world view.  There is no truth in this film.    Chartier is a moron and a thief.  He twisted a true story from someone's personal experience into an absurd platform for Hollywood brand morals of self-importance.  Complete waste of time if you want truth from art.
B001PHTPDU|2.0|Not a fan of this book.  Couldn't finish it because the author was so biased and obviously had a political agenda to push.  Don't get me wrong - I like the ideas and believe that the author has a point, and that powerful people probably do manipulate and take advantage of those in crisis BUT she was so nasty about it.  I got bored and sick of hearing it.<br /><br />Not to mention that I got more than half way through and had yet to read about anything that occured after a disaster - the first half of her case occured after a political uprising or wave of popular revolution.  Misrepresented by the title.
B001HN6940|3.0|It was okay, i'm sure it would have been just as good at home rather than go see it on the big screen.  I was thinking half way through it will this ever be OVER!! Johnny Depp played the Mad Hatter excellently, i can't fault him there. The director Tim Burton who as far as i know also made Edward Scissorhands made huge money from this as it was one of the biggest grossing movies, he is also known for making slightly odd movies.  So it's obviously popular and well liked just not my cup of tea. I do however agree that it should have been called Return to Wonderland as to not give the impression that it's a remake of the original Alice in Wonderland. Just for the record my Nine year old son liked this, not his favorite but he still thought it was very very good.
B0036EH3TS|4.0|Vivid, well acted movie full of many exciting moments. And the comic and romantic moments are  well handled. Genuinely touching and heroic at the end.     The science aspects are at best so, so but you're carried away so much by the story you can ignore them. Also, its great to see characters who aren't whiny but do  their bests to solve problems. The Blue ray is  major  upgrade  from the rather so, so earlier DVD. Highly recommended.
B0039TD7RC|4.0|Mick Jagger, for years, wished he could remix this album, and now, 40 years later, 40 years after the debauch: the heroin, the cocaine, the whiskey, the hashish, the look-alike babes, the wild nights in Paris, and Richards running a boat onto the rocks, this album washes up on the beach, again.  This is Keith Richard's album, as he literally shouted down the superior player, Mick Taylor, who's great playing gets buried, for the most part, except for \\"Ventilator Blues\\" and \\"All Down the Line\\".  Taylor's great playing on \\"Sticky Fingers\\" must have threatened Keith, Keith's insecurity showing in his mask, his heroin habit.  But in many ways, this was the Stone's, and Richard's, best work.  This must have frustrated Mick Taylor to no end, and sown the seed of his decision to leave the band.  Of course, the heroin, which Taylor, to his credit, must have realized he couldn't handle, and which tore apart Keith's playing for a decade, must have had something to do with it.<br /><br />The remix of the original tracks strikes me with mixed feelings.  The album loses some of its muddy charm  -- that Swastika and S.S. Trooper debauchery and desperation.  Yet the music, the licks, improve, in many ways, with clarity.  I'll keep both versions.  My favorite tune, \\"Sweet Virginia\\" is great on both versions.<br /><br />As for the \\"Bonus Tracks\\", for the most part, it's crap, and reminds me of \\"Jamming with Edward\\" or that awful double-album of the Stone's doing the old blues, live.  Except for \\"Plundered My Soul\\", which belongs with the original set list.  To be fair, some of the alternate takes have moments, but they're not fleshed out.  Take \\"Loving Cup\\" -- the version on \\"Shine a Light\\" movie is ten times better than this one.  But I'm basing this opinion on my first listen, and on the first listen, 40 years ago, I wasn't too hot on the album either, so perhaps it will grow on me with repeated sessions.<br /><br />The Stones should have just re-mixed the original set, and added \\"Plundered My Soul\\" in my opinion.  The other stuff doesn't stand up next to the original masterpiece.  Make no mistake, this is Malt Shop rock mixed in with country and blues, and I like it, like it, yes I do.  If nothing else, this re-issue brought an old friend back for another visit, and it was good to see her again.<br /><br />If the band tours again, without Ronnie, it'd be great to hear Mick Taylor and Keith play together again, especially on new material, and if Keith would let Mick Taylor let it loose a little more than he does here.  And, if Mick Jagger's lyrics would return to the quality of writing he puts in here.<br /><br />But one has to wonder.  With the Stones playing in front a million people on the beach at Rio during the last tour...how can they possibly top that?  And with the band aging, when I saw them in Vegas in 2008, Richards almost fell on the stage, will they still be up to the task?my opinion.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|I'm not a TV show guy per say, more of a sports fan. I used to be more into tv  in the late 80's and 90s. I did however,love the Sopronos. Community brings you back to that special feeling you had watching shows from that era. Its funny, makes a lot of references to different movies and shows from the 80's and 90's, and each character is very special. Chevy Chase and Danny Pundi steal the show most episodes! Favorite episodes include the Halloween special and Modern Warfare. This show is a definite buy!
B001FB55H6|2.0|It's tempting to dismiss this film by saying that any movie made from such a poor novel would /have/ to be an improvement. And it /is/ an improvement, which explains my two-star review of the film (compared to my one-star review of the novel -- QV, as they say in Latin).<br /><br />No one has had the guts to stand up and say that the novel is a shallow and ultimately pointless work. The issues raised by \\"Watchmen\\" were raised more than 70 years ago when Superman and Batman became the prototypes of almost every superhero to come. They need little elaboration, any more than one needs to be told that water is wet. Dr Wertham was wrong about comic books causing anti-social behavior, but he and other philosophers/psychologists correctly analyzed why super-heroes are (for better or worse) popular.<br /><br />There are no real-world superheros (as much as people like Ronald Reagan might like to think there are), which therefore renders super-hero comics a self-contained and self-referential commentary on themselves and society. A commentary /on/ a commentary, from a comic-book writer, seems pointless navel-gazing. My reaction to the novel was largely \\"Yeah, right... So what?\\".<br /><br />The film blunts much (but not enough) of the novel's intellectual pretentiousness, while discarding too much of its moral ambiguity. We are left feeling that Ozymandias was justified in killing millions of people to prevent a much greater catastrophe. And the idea that the governments of the Earth would unite against a common foe and stop fighting among themselves is not plausible. \\"The Shield of Achilles\\" gives a not-unreasonable explanation of the sources of human warfare, which would not be long-suppressed by an alien enemy. *<br /><br />The film's dialog is not far-removed from the novel's, which is unfortunate. It's not at the level of Stephen J Cannell, let alone \\"The Sopranos\\". The acting is barely adequate, with Malin Ackerman decidedly unconvincing.

B001GKJ2E8|5.0|If you like Action then you will love this. Highly entertaining, one of the best action movies i have seen. Angelina Jolie & James McAvoy were great, loved the curved bullets and the training. It has everything you will ever need all in one package!! Go get this NOW!!!

B001D8W7CW|5.0|Even though it's thirty-four years old the horror flick \\"Carrie\\" (1976), made from the Stephen King novel, is still a very absorbing and chilling film. The young Sissy Spacek was perfect for the part, that thin body, those wide eyes with their translucent pupils, the whitest, palest of skins, that quality of other-worldliness, as if she's from another galaxy. Her classmates are stereotypical brats, and a few clich&eacute;s erupt here and there - in fact, the only character who isn't a caricature is her gym teacher, the actress Betty Buckley.<br />Carrie's mother (Piper Laurie) is a Bible-thumping fanatic who could drive any daughter round the bend. Carrie White has super-developed kinetic powers that can make her move objects or people wherever she wills them to go. The final scenes in the gym on prom night when she really lets go are horrific. It's a wild climactic scene. How they ever made this into a musical, I'll never know. Betty Buckley was in it, and it flopped.<br />You don't want to play nasty tricks on Carrie because she can get back at you in spades. The initial shower scene in the film with adolescent female nudity was and is quite daring. When Carrie discovers menstruation, her female classmates turn vicious. Director Brian De Palma guides his film through the treacherous shoals of teenage cruelty, and even the young John Travolta shows up briefly to play a Neanderthal goof.<br />The movie holds up well and is worth watching to see Spacek's brilliant portrayal.
B002VPE1AW|1.0|The problem with this movie is the fact that Cameron took what could have been an epic story in an imaginative environment and defiled that promise for his jackbooted, hamhanded attempt at ramming a load of liberal America hating propaganda down our throats.  Quite simply this movie is a thinly disguised, steaming pile of \\"IT\\".  The plot is predictably bad and the special effects did nothing to alleviate the painful lack of anything even remotely intellectually stimulating.  The icing on this fecal masterpiece is how many folks joyfully swallowed this in whole... hook, line and stinker.  Now THAT is truly distressing.
B001OQCV2O|3.0|I heard a lot of negative reviews about this movie and as someone that is interested in this topic it was good.  It wasn't great, it was an average action movie that would get your thinking about the end of the world. John Cusack played a great part as parts go for him and my nine year old son absolutely loved this movie for all the action in it.  It is full on action and maybe a tiny bit too much action, maybe they could have concentrated on the story more but it was very watchable, entertaining and it is by no means disappointing.
B002N8A14M|4.0|This is a great armband for your Nano.    The Strap is adjustable enough to fit on any arm.    My favorite thing about the armband is that it does not rest your Ipod directly against your arm. The clip for the case keeps the Ipod away from your arm/armband, which means if you're a sweater (as I am), your Ipod will not be harmed by your sweat at all.    The only \\"complaint\\" I have is that it gets a little tight on the bottom. If you do not have a skinny plug for your headphones, they may not fit with the case. My headphones fit, so it did not harm my opinion, but I would make sure the headphones you're going to use have a plug that is no thicker than the stock Ipod headphones.    I love this case and would definately recommend it to others who want an armband.
0321344758|5.0|Overall, a very good introduction to web site usability and navigation design. It is concise, with little of the \\"fluff\\" commonly found in \\"Dummies\\"-type books. Diagrams and illustrations are plentiful and very useful. Krug does not go into great depth on many of the topics covered, but I don't believe he was trying to. I believe that Krug was aiming for a simple and short introduction to the field, for people who have not been exposed to it yet, and he hit right on target. If you want a short introduction to web usability, this is the book for you.     If you're looking for something more detailed, take a look at \\"Designing Web Navigation\\", by James Kalbach (O'Reilly, 2007), which is longer, more dense, with plenty of references to academic studies on usability.

To my delight, she gravitated to Coltrane -- especially this recording -- as if she had been grooving to it from the day she was born.  I would say that I was surprised, except that I too think \\"My Favorite Things\\" is something special, and then some.  You won't regret one measly cent.  Get it.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This movie is an emotional story of a young man who never had a home and who never really knew love until he stepped into the home of these people.  Sandra Bullock most definitely deserved the Oscar for this role and it is definitely one to buy when it comes out on DVD. It's one you can watch on your own or with all the family and what makes it more emotional is that it's based on a true story and that this boy who was cast aside because people didn't understand him was understood and shone bright like a star once he was loved and taught how to. I will most definitely be buying this one when it comes out on DVD.

0307271862|2.0|This novel was a huge disappointment.  Having read virtually every novel written by Mankell I was anticipating greater literary success.  It was as if he was patching together a thriller with political beliefs.  He has been drifting more into the political arena and it does not reflect well on all his earlier efforts.  Perhaps he is getting bored with thrillers and merely trying to satisfy his publisher.
0385523904|5.0|This book is perhaps the most riveting work of nonfiction I have ever read. The setting is so exotic and alien to me as an American that it reminded me of accounts I have read describing the terrible conditions in prison camps. Except this is an entire country we're talking about! The plight of the people, the hardship they endured, and the lengths to which they went just to survive are simple unbelievable (though of course I do believe the stories conveyed in the book). Barbara Demick does a fantastic job of bringing these stories to light and painting a thorough picture of the stark realities of life in North Korea. Now more than ever I feel incredibly fortunate to have been born in a place where I do not have to worry about where my next meal will come from or whether one of my neighbors is a spy for the government.

B0021L8V1G|4.0|The inevitable sequel to the [[ASIN:B001C08RHA 2008 smash hit]] proves once again the perfect fit between actor and character as Robert Downey Jr. plays the title role with his rakish wit and deep sense of irony fully intact from the first film. Sharply directed once again by actor Jon Favreau and shrewdly written by another actor, Justin Theroux, the 2010 blockbuster is as much an actors' showcase as it is a special effects-saturated comic book adventure. This precarious balance is what made the first film so ideal, and while the surprise element has been replaced in part by a breezy familiarity in the sequel, the result is still far more entertaining than most in its genre. This is despite the fact that the movie is overpopulated with colorful characters, most worthy of a film of their own.<br /><br />Overkill is a common problem in heavily invested Hollywood studio product like this, and one can quibble that nobody except Downey gets sufficient screen time to make a compelling impression. As hedonistic billionaire Tony Stark, the actor has to face off with no less than three villains, two other figures who are intentionally put on a nebulous fence between good and evil, the mysterious director of a clandestine organization called S.H.I.E.L.D. and a love interest designed to be either a sharp, take-charge businesswoman or a helpless damsel in distress depending on the plot machinations. The story picks up Stark six months after the ending of the first film as he boasts to a rapt audience at the re-instituted Stark Expo how he has maintained world peace with his impenetrable suit of armor. However, underneath his hubris, Stark hides the fact that he is dying from poisoning by the palladium core in the arc reactor that gives him not only his unique powers but his re-born life.<br /><br />Meanwhile, taciturn, cockatoo-loving Russian physicist Ivan Vanko is plotting revenge against Stark for the act of betrayal he feels Stark's father committed against his dying arms-dealer father. In fact, Vanko has designed his own arc reactor with the intent of destroying Stark, an act almost realized at the Circuit de Monaco. Stark's smarmy business rival, fellow weapons manufacturer Justin Hammer, will stop at nothing to secure the secret to Stark's armored suit, while U.S. Senator Stern of Pennsylvania wants Stark prosecuted for crimes against the state. On the fence about Stark is a carryover from the first storyline, Lt. Colonel James \\"Rhodey\\" Rhodes, whose friendship with the billionaire is severely tested by Stark's excessively destructive behavior. A new character, Natalie Rushman, is introduced in an ambivalent manner as a new assistant to replace Pepper Potts, Stark's feisty gal Friday-turned-CEO. Natalie's motivations are revealed in due time. It all comes to a head at the expo where Vanko and Hammer have colluded to produce an aerial battle royale.<br /><br />That's a whole lot of plot to fit into a 124-minute movie, but at least the momentum never flags. The problem for comic fanboys may well be the dearth of action sequences. The showdowns between Stark and Vanko create the necessary tension although the build-ups are rather predictable, and the climactic battle sequence feels more like a swirling meteor shower since it takes place at night. Still, cinematographer Matthew Libatique and art director J. Michael Riva do first-rate work here with the production details. Moreover, the actors do their best even if their characters are given short shrift in the screenplay. Mickey Rourke relies on his own uncomfortably maniacal screen persona and idiosyncratic touches to embody Vanko's two-dimensional motives, while Sam Rockwell is even more cartoonish with a petulant, hammy albeit amusing turn as Hammer.<br /><br />Replacing Terrence Howard, Don Cheadle does what he can as the put-upon best friend and archetypal soldier, but Rhodey has to represent the film's most thankless role. A surprisingly cast Garry Shandling brings a nice edge to the avuncular senator, and Favreau himself repeats his role as Stark's loyal chauffeur Happy Hogan. No fool as a director, he gets to face off to primarily comic effect with Scarlett Johansson, properly feline and physically adroit in her black catsuit, as Natalie. Her ball-breaking [[ASIN:B000056PMV Charlie's Angels]]-style fight sequence is entertaining if a bit derivative. As Pepper, Gwyneth Paltrow gets more to do this time around, bantering with Downey with Nick-and-Nora-level &eacute;lan, but the character is near-impossible to believe. Fans, however, will have no problem loving and believing in the sequel, but the pervasive one-liners and the wild zigzags between hubris and insecurity make a strong case to redub the hero Irony Man.reau himself repeats his role as Stark's loyal chauffeur Happy Hogan.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have 3 kids and hate to exercise, but of course I definitely need to tone up. However, I want to do it in as little time as possible yet feel like I'm making a difference. There are 3 different workouts and I love that you work more than one are at a time.  She's down to earth and not annoyingly bubbly. There are 2 girls behind her; 1 does low impact for beginners and the other does high impact for more advanced. I follow the beginner but do the advanced sets when I can.  I noticed a difference in my endurance just within a few days. I thought you had to master the 1st level before moving to the 2nd or 3rd, but I like to do a different level each day and just do the best I can.  I've been using it for a few weeks.  I admit  I haven't stuck to it every day, so I don't see much in the way of results.  However, I've noticed a slight difference in my abs, so I'm sure if I commit more I'll see better results.  You are definitely sweating like crazy by the end of the workout, even with the low impact, but you feel good about yourself!  So far, I'm having a lot of fun with it. Yes, I actually used the word \\"fun\\" to describe exercise.
0971407614|5.0|Very few of the 111 exercises require basic, easy-to-find household equipment, like a table or couch. But there's no muscle that can't be worked out using nothing at all, according to this book. And from what I've practiced already, it seems to be true. I got this book three weeks ago and I have already begun one of Mark's programs. I had serious doubts, but I'm already seeing a difference (even though I've been lifting weights for years). Unlike exercises in the gym, I'm finding these exercises tie my muscles together in a functional way, leaving nothing lacking and nothing out of proportion. I've hit a plateau with my gym workouts for the last 2 years, but now, with Lauren's program, both my strength and muscle tone are increasing. When I'm done with the program I'll experiment with some others of his 111 exercises. I may never go back to the gym. At the very least, this book will provide a good supplement to my gym routine (IF I return, that is!).

B001JNND9W|4.0|I had seen this a couple decades ago, I just wanted my own copy. Excellent quality on the video and sound. Nice addition to my library.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|The first time that I saw Janelle Monáe was on the great video for Outkast's 2006 song \\"Morris Brown,\\" which is featured on the Idlewild soundtrack.  In the video, she sings along to Scar's very nice voice: \\"My heart is like a marching band/ I'm a fan in the stands/ Yes I am/ and I'm hollering hey baby /saying hey baby.\\" I was immediately drawn to her and I had not heard a word from her yet.  I have always been a fan of Outkast, The Dungeon Family, and their affiliates (e.g. Organized Noise, Goodie Mob, etc..), so when they gently ask me to pay attention to an artist, I do.     Before the release of the \\"Morris Brown\\" video, Monáe had two solo tracks on Big Boi's 2005 compilation album Big Boi Presents...Got Purp?, Vol. 2: \\"Time Will Reveal\\" and \\"Lettin' Go.\\" On the Idlewild soundtrack, she was featured on two tracks: \\"Call the Law\\" and \\"In Your Dreams.\\" All four of the songs that I have mentioned are certainly respectable tracks, I even really like \\"Lettin' Go,\\" but I always felt that there would be something \\"more.\\" I prayed that she would not be tragically overlooked like The Dungeon Family's Slimm Calhoun's great 2001 debut The Skinny. Enter Metropolis Suite I of IV: The Chase.    I bought Metropolis Suite I of IV:  The Chase (EP) very quickly; directly from Janelle Monáe's website.  So fast that my version does not include the two songs \\"Mr. President\\" and \\"Smile.\\" This is how taken with her I was.  When I first heard \\"Violet Stars Happy Hunting,\\" I knew that this was the \\"more\\" that I alluded to earlier.  While the media began, annoyingly, trying to find someone she sounded like (Andre 3000 was the ubiquitous reference at the time), I was more interested in what she was trying to do, herself, outside of the trappings of musical genealogies.  With \\"Sincerely, Jane,\\" I not only knew that she was doing something very different from those she was being compared to, but also this was the song I was trying to get everyone I knew to listen to.  At the time, whichwas 2007, I was crazy about Armand Van Helden's \\"I Want Your Soul,\\" Gnarles Barkley's \\"Storm Coming,\\" Klaxon's \\"Golden Skans,\\" Lizz Wright's \\"Trouble,\\" and Lauryn Hill's much maligned \\"Lose Myself.\\" When Monáe arrived, I was really good!  And here she is again.    I am currently on my fourth spin of The ArchAndroid and the only word that I keep going back to to describe the album is \\"brilliant.\\"  Music, for me, has always been very much based upon mood.  As I love this album in its entirety (and I really appreciate the fact that I feel like I have to listen to this album in its entirety everytime in order to garner its fullest offerings), I certainly have favorites. They are \\"Sir Greendown,\\" \\"Oh Maker,\\" \\"Neon Valley Street,\\" \\"Say You'll Go,\\" and \\"BabopbyeYa,\\" and both \\"Suites\\" are stunning!  I kept \\"57821\\" out of this list because I wanted to say something in particular about it.    Because the CD does not come with lyrics, I scoured the internet last night for the lyrics to \\"57821.\\" Didn't find them.  So I tried to listen carefully. The main vocals are quite clear but it's those beautiful choruses that I need clarification on.  The first chorus centers on Anthony Greendown (\\"Sir Greendown\\") and Cindi Mayweather.  Monáe and Deep Cotton emphasize the word \\"both\\" in the first chorus and then they emphasize the word \\"us\\" in the second chorus.  As I am not quite sure what the first chorus says and because of that, I will only share with you the second chorus as I hear it:    \\"Cause you're the one/  One by one/  It's your time/  Lead us all back to one/  The sun has come/  May your light lead us all back to one/  Indivisible sum/  Here's the book now the saga's begun/  You're the one.\\"    For me, this song is at once the ultimate love song as well as a call for a universality that does not demand that we flatten our differences in order to articulate a common emotion.  The movement from \\"both\\" to \\"us\\" in these lyrics speaks to the power of the universal that is housedin the particular.  Many will have us believe that this album is so far on the margins that it cannot possibly be accessible.  \\"57821\\" centers this album for me; it is The ArchAndroid's thesis--one that does not come at the end of the first paragraph of the classic essay that we are used to.  This is my favorite song from her thus far. Gorgeous song.    The songs that I did not mention are also terrific like \\"Dance or Die,\\" \\"Faster,\\" Cold War,\\" \\"Tightrope,\\" and that yell on \\"Come Alive (The War of the Roses)\\" is dope!      It is quite ambitious of her to begin her career exploring concept albums, as they are very difficult to pull off.  They either end brilliant or disastrous--she easily lands on the former side with both attempts.  I am happy that I can now place Monáe's albums next to Tori Amos' impeccable concept album Scarlet's Walk.    I encourage everyone to support this wonderful piece.  If anyone needs their current unwanted musical palate cleansed, this is the album.  For those who have lost faith in popular music, this is it.  If you need inspiration like I did (do), this is it.    Cindi Mayweather asks at the end of \\"57821\\": \\"I wonder if I'm the one?\\"   The chorus answers: \\"You're the one.\\"     The ArchAndroid is the one.

As a real fan of Twin Peaks and all things from David Lynch, I was frustrated when the program originally aired since the network kept changing its play dates and times continuously, hence it was almost impossible to follow the story line(s).  This set of DVDs brought everything into focus - finally!!

Thank you, Richard, for writing this incredibly detailed and fun volume that teaches us that a great loaf of bread is always within our reach. It is amazingly gratifying to be able to produce a beautiful loaf of bread in your own home. This is the art that is very basic but almost forgotten because buying the loaf is very easy. Yet when you take your own loaf of French bread from the oven the feeling you experience is unbelievable!
1416914285|5.0|While a lot of people compare the characters and plot to other books, I thought this book was written in a different type of imagination. I have never been much of a reader, therefore, I don't have many books to compare it too. Many books are about the girl falling in love with the guy and I think this was written in Cassandra Clare's own form of love. She did a great job with the characters and had me reading one page to the next without being able to stop. I've found out that when reading, you can't compare it to any other sort of writing, you have to put yourself in that particular book and I did just that, which is why I gave it a 5 star!

B003KTEGG2|5.0|Infinite Arms is Band of Horses third album, but first with the additions of Tyler Ramsey (guitar, vocals) and Ryan Monroe (keyboards, vocals). It features carefully crafted harmony and while maintaining the Band's unique combination of raw reverb, folk influence and contemplation.<br /><br />The Band's new polished sound shines in Factory, a song of longing for the past and fearing the future, \\"It's temporary, this place I'm in. I permanently won't do, this again\\". This depth is immediately complimented with signature whimsy, \\"An hour later, I was thinking it over by the snack machine. I thought about you in a candy bar.\\" This balance of contemplation and abstraction is also evident in Dilly, Northwest Apartment and Laredo, all very song talks of missing someone with high tempo and nice guitar riff.<br /><br />Compliments is definitely a favorite already. Vibrant guitar with a strong beat and great contemplative lyrics. \\"If there's a God up in the air, someone lookin' over everyone, at least you've got something to fall back on. And what are people really for? Does anybody even care? I bet you get a lot of compliments down there.\\"<br /><br />The band's newest members show their influence while evolving the band's sound to a new level. Perfected through performances at BoH's live shows, Older, a mid-tempo country number featuring keyboardist Ryan Monroe on vocals, captures the band's southern sensibilities. Bartles + James is a mellow and harmonic ode that reminds of Fleet Foxes and Phil Ek, who also produced Infinite Arms. The beautifully sentimental Evening Kitchen and Blue Beard have a lot of Tyler Ramsey's influence and remind me of his solo album, A Long Dream About Swimming Across the Sea.<br /><br />On My Way Back Home is almost a folk/rock version of the Beach Boys' classic \\"Sloop John B.\\". A great song about getting back to where you want to be, \\"I came in this way.

0307588335|1.0|I am so disappointed that I purchased this book.  The research and editing are shabby.  The first few chapters about the author's uninteresting career path are useless.      Crtically, McDonald's view on Lehman and the financial crisis cannot be accurately described as from a priviliged vantage point.  He may have had a building pass (for just 4 years) but that's about as \\"inside\\" as he got.  He was in an nonessential role amidst a department pretty far away from the fray and he was two/three/four levels removed from being \\"in the room\\" as the crisis unfolded.      Most disappointing is that McDonald knows almost nothing about which he claims expertise - how to do research, how to trade, how the markets work, what drives security pricing in stocks and bonds and everything in between, etc.    I have never written a book review on Amazon but felt compelled to offer an opinion here because this book is so bad.  There are many better takes on the crisis that provide true insight to the generally curious and the financially sophisticated.  Please don't waste your money on this travesty.

Easily enough Metheny, and a showcase of the beautiful capabilities of Jopek's voice.

At first I was kind of disappointed myself, but I thought about how selfish that was and how the artist should be allowed to be just that. That said, I'm not one of those that doesn't like this cd because it doesn't sound like \\"Rubber Factory\\" or \\"Thickfreakness\\". If I want to hear those two cds I will put them in as I please. So, I began to listen to \\"Brothers\\" with more of an open mind and after several listens I have to say I really enjoy it. Yeah, it lacks that raw energy that previous efforts had, but that doesn't take away from the quality of music in my opinion. The songs are still well written and arranged and enjoyable to listen to. They just require a different mood and mindset. If I want some energy I'll listen to \\"Thickfreakness\\" or \\"Rubber Factory\\". If I want to just relax and hang out, I'll throw in Brothers. Not everything has to be full on rock, at least for me. There are plenty of highlights here, in fact the only song that really doesn't do it for me is \\"Go Getter\\". If you're open minded enough and just want some good bluesy tunes, there is no better. If you have expectations of The Black Keys sounding like they did several years ago, you'll be disappointed. They have evolved from that, at least for the time being. That doesn't make the music itself any worse though.
B003BKF696|2.0|I really want to like this band. But, like trying to get through a novel everyone else likes that you can't quite get into, I keep putting the book down. Or, in this case, can't quite make it through an entire song on my iPod without rolling my eyes and moving on. It's frustrating, because it feels lonely being bored by The National. And admittedly, this isn't quite like me, I'm open to new music, especially intelligent indie rock; and I'm an album guy, not a song-by-song iTunes addict. But...    But does no one else think The National sounds like Interpol with less hooks, trudging through even more molasses?  They sound like everything I dislike about Wilco, Band of Horses, and Fleet Foxes shaken up in a blender and poured out onto a Brooklyn yard sale. Maybe it's Matt Berninger's super serious baritone which irritates the heck out of me and the fact that the record feels too lived in, worked over, thought out, poeticized. It drones and drones, and every song sounds the same to me.    Maybe I just like my music to create genuine atmosphere and emotion (Neutral Milk Hotel, The Shins, Belle and Sebastian) or just have fun (Animal Collective, MGMT, New Pornographers)  but I get frustrated when there is so much hype surrounding something so, well, banal. And Conor Oberst isn't even involved!    There has been more preening substance devoted to this album (philosophical musings in Pitchfork, NY Times, etc.) than I think it deserves. The articles written about this album are more interesting than the album itself. Sometimes hype is, after all, warranted. Just not here. There is a haunting prettiness that invades the music at times courtesy of all the bearded brothers involved in this band who play their instruments well, but it's just too self-important to me, the soundtrack to a \\"No Country for Old Men\\" type movie where your focus is meant to shift and waver, to visuals, to words, to a language outside of itself.    \\"High Violet\\", though accomplished, doesn't hold my focus.
0375421947|5.0|Easily one of my favorite reads.  By the 3rd time through I was able to grasp the core of what the character was about.
B0020MMBCG|4.0|I think this methodology would be extremely helpful in a lot of situations - I'm looking forward to making use of it. However, I'm not sure the author did a great job of stating how to apply it (besides implying always). I felt the problem solving examples in the book were pretty contrived.
B00328G4V6|4.0|A very nice and eclectic collection. Some alternate takes of familiar tunes and  a few blues tracks previously not released. Sometimes the drums are a bit looser than  on finished album versions and sometimes the guitar also is not as \\"tight\\". But the energy  is very stong and the version of \\"Here My Train A Coming\\" is one of the best I've heard.  A great collection to introduce new people to Hendrix especially for it's blues roots.
B0036XN2L2|4.0|I was worried about this album, when I saw the song titles: \\"Raised On Rock\\", \\"Spirit of Rock\\", \\"Rock Zone\\"... This could indeed by a serious signal of extreme lack of imagination in the lyrics department, a lack of imagination that could be transferred to the music itself...<br /><br />Fortunately, that was not the case. The music is strong (with a lot of outsiders writers credited, to my surprise-mainly the producers), production crystal clear and punchy, Matthias Jabs solos are some of the best and strategically placed. And the final song (\\"The Best Is Yet To Come\\") is a blast. If this is indeed their farewell album (who knows), it was a perfect song to end it all.<br /><br />Also, I thought the album is much. much better than \\"HUMAN MIND\\".<br /><br />I wish good health and long lives for Meine, Schenker, Jabs and everybody involved with thi8s great band along the years.<br /><br />P.S. It's a shame that Rudolf's brilliant brother, Michael, never had the same level-headness to administer a band...
B002ZG996I|5.0|This movie is captivating.  The chemistry between Alex Oloughlin and Jennifer Lopez is outstanding.  It is truly funny.  Jennifer's best performance and Alex is an impressive actor.  You love them as a couple.  It is a well-balanced movie.  Everyone will enjoy it, the girlfriend or wife and the boyfriend or hubbie..

1594488843|2.0|Dan Pink has written some excellent and thought provoking books.  This is not one of them.  Unlike A Whole New Mind, Drive does not present many new ideas or new thinking.  Largely a rehash of years of research and theory on motivation, Drive spends a lot of time belaboring the obvious: we are motivated by more than money.  Duh.  Most employers fail to recognize this and change their policies accordingly.  Double duh.  This is news?<br /><br />Sadly, we see this pattern a lot.  A good author makes a deserved reputation with original and thought provoking work, and subsequently harvests this reputation to sell considerably inferior work.  Paging John Grisham.  Dan Pink writes very well in an accessible and engaging manner.  But unless you are entirely new to the workplace, or have been asleep for the last 30 years, there is not much here that is new.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|No need to discuss the original release - you know the album and you know it's a masterpiece. This new edition includes a bonus disc of outtakes and new/old songs that shed a little light on the Stones' creative processes, and also beg the question, \\"Why?\\"<br /><br />I've heard a lot of bootlegged outtakes from the Exile sessions, and it is nice to have clean, clear versions of Soul Survivor (Keith's vocals), Good Time Women (Tumbling Dice early version), and an early take of Loving Cup. These are somewhat revelatory, but not to the extent of Dylan's Tell Tale Signs. See, the Stones creative process is different from Dylan's. Bob will record a song a certain way to the point of being a finished track, then re-record it a different way. The result is the gobs of great stuff coming out of his Bootleg Series. The Stones are quicker to abandon an idea, and often record right over early versions creating the dense sound that has become their trademark. So when Mick went to the vault, he found mostly instrumental tracks that had no vocals. So Mick wrote new lyrics and recorded new vocals for old instrumental tracks. The \\"2010\\" Mick vocals are very obvious. So the widely bootlegged instrumental Aladdin Story now has vocals! And it's kind of weird listening to it that way after becoming familiar with the instrumental version.<br /><br />At this point, some diehards may cry, \\"Blaspheme!\\" The truth is, Mick really tried to write lyrics consistent with themes within the original, and appears to have tried to sound \\"young\\" again (which is an improvement over the mannered style he's adopted in later years). The result is that the new/old songs are better than half the songs on A Bigger Bang! My fervent hope is that this exercise has awakened something in Mick and maybe the next all-new Stones album will be rootsier, and with more care and effort put into it than we've seen lately.<br /><br />The remastered original Exile really kicks! They didn't try to \\"fix\\" the gloriously muddy sound at all. In fact, the flaws are even more evident. Now you can really hear how the sax solo in Casino Boogie just squats on top of the mix obliterating everything beneath it. How Charlie's bass drum dominates the beat of Tumbling Dice and punches right through your speakers. Packaging isn't very extensive. One little booklet of uncredited photos and WHERE'S THE POSTCARDS????<br /><br />I already owned a copy of Exile, but I bought this anyway and with no reservations. Hell, I own four copies of this on vinyl!the flaws are even more evident. Now you can really hear how the sax solo in Casino Boogie just squats on top of the mix obliterating everything beneath it.

B00005LW7R|4.0|If you want a version of Falstaff without the charicature - a version in which the characters are realistic human beings (apart from Falstaff himself, of course) - then this might easily be the version for you. Abbado leads a performance which is relatively light on its feet and definitely more intimate than many of the classics; textures are airy and delicate, climaxes more subtle than pverpowering, and any exaggeration for comical effect is avoided. The performance is also a very fast one, maybe a little bit too quick-paced at times, but in general Abbado's is a viable approach.    The cast is in general a strong one. Bryn Terfel might seem like an obvious choice for Falstaff, but I am not completely sure he fully convinces in the title role - he is perhaps a little bit too young and fresh sounding, very energetic and forward; not the in the end likeable old fop we are used to hear, but a more obviously unsympathetic, even wicked, bully. Maybe Terfel overcharacterizes it, and I am not sure taking away the sympathy for Falstaff benefits the opera. In any case, he has a warm, flexible voice and many of the numbers are gorgeously sung. I am glad to have heard it, and maybe I'll be more thoroughly convinced on repeated listening, but the characterization does come as something of a surprise.    I have no qualms about Adrianne Pieczonka's finely characterized and well sung Alice. I am also pretty much convinced by Doufexis and Röschmann, whereas Diadkova's Quickly is truly outstanding. Thomas Hampson's Ford is perhaps more questionable, but mostly, I think, because his is such an unusual take on the role, relatively dry, sung rather un-Verdi-like with the character portrayed as humane but unlikeable. Daniil Shtoda is, however, colorful and effective and the smaller roles are overall pretty good. The Berlin Philharmonic is riveting, of course, although the playing is softer and subtler (if quicker) than we are used to in this work. The recording is relatively close, but the sound crystal clear and very effective. Overall, then, this might not be the first choice in this work (I guess Toscanini is still the classic), but it is still a rather fine achievement, definitely worth considering - especially if you already know the opera and is interested in an alternative take on it.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Just got the CD today and it's NIICCCE. Production quality is good and if you bought her first CD and wanted a more fulfilling experience this CD will do it. It's the type of CD you put in on a road trip and just leave in. The sounds are wide and varied. There's a little Busta meets Afrika Bambaataa in the beginning, then you get this Sergio Mendes track with a Erykah Badu flow. After that it goes into a Lauren Hill meets the Love Boat vibe. It's just crazy and really nice to hear. Now someone needs to get this thing on the radio. Janelle and the CD deserve it.     Pick it up you won't be disappointed.
B002L3RVCY|4.0|I fell in love with this series near the end of the first season on Cartoon Network. The visuals just keep improving - from the movie to this series, season one to season two. I believe that computer objects used for things like the ships and primary characters have reached a level of sophistication that much of the work on new episodes goes into the creation of new shapes and objects to continually create new characters, worlds and ships. Inexplicably, following the disastrous writing of the prequels, the writing for this cartoon series has far surpassed expectations. Perhaps Lucas should stay with 30 minute limits.     This collection is great with the minor exception of the keeper. The method they use to store the disks doesn't hold them reliably in the cover when it is standing in a rack. The combination of the 'extras' with the individual episodes is nicely done and helps place them in context.

B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a great workout DVD.  I don't even like Jillian Michaels, but she is a great motivator.  I'm over 50 and in OK shape, but I had not worked out in a few years so I started out slow.  It is so much fun and hard.  I'm still on level 1, but at least I can get through the entire level 1.  I can move up a level or add heavier weights now.  I add a little warm up because her warm up is only 2 minutes and I don't feel that's enough.  I also add more stretches at the end, but that is just my personal preference.  I can't believe how much better I feel after only 30 minutes a day.  Buy it, you won't regret it.

B0030Y11XS|1.0|When \\"Roger and Me\\" was released two decades ago, I thought it was one of the best documentaries I had seen in years.  Sure, there were points where Michale Moore overplayed things a bit, but the way much of big industry treated American workers was in need of some overplay.  At that point, although I did not exactly agree with his politics, I thought Moore was a promising film maker who would contribute much to the political discussion.<br /><br />While Moore's bottom line (and waistline) has grown considerably, the merits of his work have been on a sharp decline.  Where once he was challenging, now he is a mere caricature of his former self.  At this point, he is appealing to the political left and attacking the political right and his concern for the \\"little guy\\" - a big part of his early work - is more how their pain may be used for policial capital than their problems.<br /><br />\\"Capitalism: A Love Story\\" is little more than \\"CAPITALISM BOO!! SOCIALISM HOORAY!!\\"  Instances of the one-sided treatment and manipulation of the suffering of others abounds and one would think the lessons of the last few decades never happened.  Wall Street certainly is guilty of a lot in the past few years but let us not forget that government was their partner in this mess.  So how does giving all the chips in the game to the other culprit solve things?<br /><br />Moore never really deals with that issue because he can't.  He somehow wishes to give the country back to the people but confuses \\"the people\\" with \\"the state.\\"  They are not the same and never have been.  In the meantime, Moore will continue to make dreck like this because it is what Hollywood wants him to make.  But isn't Hollywood big business?  Moore is just another hypocrite who wants us to \\"do as I say - not as I do.\\"
0316044938|2.0|I think that I'd like my heaven to be something along the lines of what is written in this book, with a choice to move forward or continue to watch over my friends and loved ones. While of course the subject matter was difficult to deal with, I found some comfort in the story of her living in her heaven as the puzzle of her death fell into place.  I have to admit that I found some comfort as well in the death of her murderer, although I wish it had happened sooner. I understood that the book was fiction, but some parts of it touched me deeply with the way it was written. I recommend the book. If I watched the movie first, I never would have read the book, as it wasn't that good.

I pretty much found this information similar to the observations and ideas from the book called \\"The Secret\\". The way a person sees and thinks about things is how  his life will develop. Your body will not be at ease if you are focusing on just the negative aspects of life. Make good choices.
1423113381|4.0|Percy Jackson is a tough act to follow. Without a doubt, the pressure was on author Rick Riordan to follow-up the adventures of his demi-god-turned-hero with more exciting tales of fantasy and adventure. The result is The Red Pyramid, the first book in Riordan's Kane Chronicles, which is shaping up to be a worthy and enjoyable follow-up to Percy Jackson. While there will always be a special place in my heart for Percy and the Olympians, they just might have to make room for Carter and Sadie Kane of The Kane Chronicles.    In The Red Pyramid we meet siblings Carter and Sadie Kane, who have been raised apart for virtually their entire lives. While Sadie has been living quietly in London with her grandparents, Carter has been traveling with the world with his eccentric Egyptologist father, soaking up information about Ancient Egypt, working on archeological digs and, oddly enough, seemingly running from something. After their father is kidnapped by the Egyptian god Set and the Egyptian gods are released, Carter and Sadie must set out on an adventure to stop the Egyptian gods and save their father. The siblings learn that they are descended from a line of Egyptian pharaohs magicians and have the ability to wield Egyptian magic. Using their new-found powers (and getting help from some new friends along the way), Carter and Sadie battle through gods and monsters and learn about the secret world of the House of Life, a piece of Egyptian culture that still exists today.    As fun, quirky and pulse-pounding as Percy Jackson, The Red Pyramid offers everything fans have come to expect from Riordan. The characters are complex and easy to root for; the world is unique and lush with a hint of modern quirkiness thrown in. The adventure is a great thrill ride that'll keep readers flipping pages and demanding more once it's over. Most importantly, Riordan does an amazing job of building a world all its own.    I have to admit that this new venture isn't completely perfect -at pointsit seemed to parallel Percy Jackson almost too much, from the backdrop of Egyptian mythology to the characters. I was hoping that this new series could stand on its own more, but it's obviously \\"modeled\\" after the Percy Jackson series. Also, the middle dragged a little bit. There were some plotlines and scenes that seemed unneeded or just a little too long. While the beginning was enthralling and the ending satisfying, I would have liked to see a little more editing work done on the middle to keep the pacing up.    Overall a great start to a great new adventure. I can't wait to see what's in store for Carter and Sadie in future installments.
B002ZFQD04|5.0|As being a fan of Madonna for many years I have to say this is worth haveing in your collection. Its well put together and well edited. Not over doing it with efects.It's just as good as the Confessions CD/DVD. Madonna proves again she puts on an amazing show. The behind the sceens part is cool to see mostly because it focuses more on the show and tour. The only down fall is it should have included the three different songs Madonna performed in 2009 tour as bonus tracks.

B001VNB54A|2.0|I had such high hopes for this series..especially after watching BoB. Yes...I knew it was going to be totally different then BoB...but I also expected it to hold my interest as much as BoB did. Sadly it hasn't. I think I stopped watching around episode 5 or 6. Nothing I saw in TP compared to excellent portrayal of Major Winters by Damian Lewis from BoB. I just couldn't latch on to any of the characters. For some reason none of the battle scenes were as compelling as say the Brecourt Assault depicted in BoB. TP did have some moments, \\"We don't have enough men\\", but just not enough to keep me watching.

B0039ZF8D2|5.0|Nasir Jones is one of the most influential and most powerful emcee in the rap game, from the classic storytelling from illmatic to the more political socio rap from Nas today, Nas is a veteran in the music business. Damian \\"Jr. Gong\\" Marley is one of the most well known reggae artists of this generation, and being the youngest/last son of the reggae legend Bob Marley, Damian knows a little bit about making good music with all types of sounds. These two unlikely duo did a song together back in 2005 on Damian Marleys album Welcome to Jamrock called Road To Zion, which was an instance classic. If listeners ever heard that song, they don't know anything yet.<br /><br />This is album takes Hip Hop and Reggae to another level, every song on here is truly an inspiration to the human soul and really makes you feel the poverty thats going on in the motherland of Africa. Each song has a purpose whether it be to lift up your spirits, directly hit the human conscious, or start a revolt, this album is really about starting a new revolution. Nas and Damian's lyrical delivery is really on point on this album, even though I believe that Nas is one of the best lyricsts the music business has to offer, there are times where Damian Marley outshines Nas. The production is a joy to listen too, no track sounds the same, and each song has a specific instrument used where the beat surrounds around. This album is one of the best Hip Hop albums I've heard in a long long time, and reggae album as well, even though its not your typcial reggae album. THis album is truly a revelation and will soon become an untimely classic.<br /><br />1) As We Enter - A great start to the album, the beat makes you wanna get up and dance, but also wanna kill somebody at the same time. Damian and Nas go back and forth with the rhymes and its a real treat. Nas lyrically destroys the track and lets everyone know that him and Damian are the Kings of what they do and they ain't playin. 5/5<br /><br />2) Tribes At War feat. K'naan - In guerilla warfare this would be the music they would be playing before a big battle. The african precussions are used to create a battle atmosphere, and makes you imagine a circle of dancers dancing around a big fire. K'naan arrives dropping a good verse and the chorus would make you wanna go to war. 5/5<br /><br />3) Strong Will Continue - this is one of the most bone chilling songs on the album. This is a song of hope, but also a song of uprising. The main theme is Resistance, finding a reason to go on even though you are at a time where hope is nowhere to be seen. Strong bass, and guitars are used in this song, and Damian outshines Nas on this one, but Nas kills it with the last verse. 5/5<br /><br />4) Leaders feat. Stephen Marley - this song features brother of Damian, Stephen Marley who provides the hook. This song has more of a classic reggae feel with the instrumentals.  Good lyrics by Damian and Nas, overall good song. 4.5/5<br /><br />5) Friends - A more african feel than the rest of the album, with the backround vocals and strings and strong bumping of the drums. A more depressing feel but more educative storytelling.  The song tells a good story of true friends and how long they can and will last. 5/5<br /><br />6) Count Your Blessings - I Love this f***in song. This is my personal favorite on the album. The song is the most chill of the album and will just keep your toes tapping and head nodding. It's really hard to not like this track, its all about love. Damian and Nas provide verses that have a positive outlook of life. One of the best feel good songs I've ever heard in my life, and teaches people how to give thanks and appreciation to the one life they have. 5/5<br /><br />7) Dispear - this track aquires pianos and strong choirs. This is a song of warriors with sounds of weaponry in the backround. The title of this song pretty much tells it all. Nas is the lyrical king, and outshines Damian on this one. Damian is truly a musical genius combining congas, strings and piano so smoothly. Great song. 5/5<br /><br />8) Land of Promise feat. Dennis Brown - the theme of this song is AFRICA. The promise lands and the origins of the people. Its a storytelling of returning to the promise lands. Classsic reggae sounds and Nas adds his touch. 4/5<br /><br />9) In His Words feat. Stephen Marley - the overall song is bless. Song gives strength to those that need it and gives you an extra push to keep moving forward. Its a beautiful song about going to hard times knowing that God will watch over you, and to stay faithful. Good message, good song. 5/5<br /><br />10) Nah Mean - this is probably the only filler track on the album, to me the song seemed out of place, but its not a bad song. Its a hard song that showcases that if Damian would ever become a rapper he could hang with the rest. The beat goes soooooo hard and the lyrics are gangsta. Its a raw song but it seems a bit out of place. 4/5<br /><br />11) Patience - all about lyrics on this track, filled with sounds of Africa. The chorus is memorable and eary. This is deep and its very hard for me to elaborate the impact, but the listeners will have different opinions. I for one, love this track. 5/5<br /><br />12) My Generation feat. Joss Stone & Lil Wayne - The song for the children, filled with kids singing the chorus provided with the vocals of soul singer Joss Stone is a nice touch. Damian opens up the track with a spiritual verse, Nas proves that his vocab is mad crazy and his flow is incredible. I was amazed to hear that they would actually let Lil Wayne be on an album like this. Its pretty rare to hear Lil Wayne do a verse without cursing whatsoever, if Lil Wayne could put this much effort in his verses in every song he does, he could become legendary. A great song. 5/5<br /><br />13) Africa Must Wake Up feat. K'naan - an ode to Africa and notifying that the continent is in trouble and people need to wake up and help their fellow people in need. The album couldn't end on a higher note, Nas and Damian couldn't made a better album. This unstoppable duo just proved that two different people from two different parts of the world that do two different types of music could come together and make great music and work as one to do good. This album is a milestone in how music can influence and help the world as a whole not just themselves. 5/5g. 5/5    8) Land of Promise feat. Dennis Brown - the theme of this song is AFRICA.

B000G6BM00|4.0|Alien was an interesting contrast to Star Wars.  That's where the cult started. Alien had a lot of good hard nosed reality to it. In the characters and their interactions who knew what hard work was all about. Alien saw a group of people fight and die due to human weaknesses and strengths.  Aliens mopped up and tried to finish off the aliens.    They shifted from the miner's hard life to the Marines and succeeded in watching a non-technological species haress, frighten, and kill off the vast majority. Aliens also had an interesting survivor in a little eight year old girl Nute.  She also led the Marines in how to survive the aliens, for a little while at least.    Bill Paxton from Terminator gives another great performance of a punk.  He's absolutelly hillarious in both Terminator and Aliens!  Michael Bien also comes from Terminator to give another good performance to fight off something bigger than a human. Another James Cameron find and favorite was introduced in Aliens, Jenette Goldstein.  She also later appreas in Terminator 2 and Titanic!    No movie or book is perfect; so, I've gotten in the habit of starting with a four star no matter what.  Five star . . . i don't know what's five star.  Can I find fault with Aliens?  Yes!  There's the awkward gravity fields when the marines are free-falling from orbit; now, wait a minute!  First, they're in orbit; so, just releasing them wouldn't cause them to just start free-falling; if them, then why not the mother ship?  There's not much to find fault with the move though; but, i did find something, so, my principle of starting with four stars no matter what works here.    I finish with noting that I've thought of a solution to Ripley and the Marines problem of dealing with all those aliens and still have seventeen days to go!  Simply pack that marines battlestation sports car with food and head far away from the atmospheric processing plant . . . till it can't run no more.  Why would the aliens think to search outside the atmospheric processing plant for more hosts?  Private Hudson would have said F'in A to that!
B0029XFNAI|5.0|One of our Christmas Eve traditions is to go out to eat then come home and watch this movie.  We still look forward to it every time.  This DVD is to replace our old VHS copy.  If you have seen the movie you know what a sweet story it is.  Mara Wilson is perfect as the little girl.  Her facial expressions and looks of pure joy are outstanding.  All the actors are just right for their parts.  If by some chance you have never seen this, you absolutely must rent it.  Then I believe you will also need to buy it.
B002ZG997M|4.0|this review is for people that have already seen the movie. the descriptions within it will be vague to avoid ruining it for anyone, but hopefully people will know to what i am referring.like it or not, religion is the backbone of this movie. it is what drives the main characters to do what they do, and it shapes all the events within the film. that said, hope is the heart of this movie. there were several moments in the film where i was hopeful for the future, even with all the problems in the world. the fact that something so small could drive a person so passionately, especially for good, is inspiring beyond comprehension. there were a few moments watching the movie where i teared up, it was that beautiful. it made me wish that i could find something that would drive me that passionately, that i could believe in with all my heart and soul. i suppose that i'm not exactly giving my respect to the film itself, but the idea that drives it. you don't have to be religious to be moved by this film, and you really don't even have to be moved by it. there is plenty to enjoy at face value and you can still walk out feeling satisfied. but for those willing to look deeper into the film will find much more to enjoy, and much to think about. see this movie, take away from it what you will, but see it.
B0039208QM|4.0|We're practically up to our knees in Batman movies by now. Comparing the newer series \\"Batman Begins\\" (2005)  to the former \\"Batman\\" (1989):  The more recent series is a rather staight-faced interpretation  (good nonetheless) when compared to the previous series which often borders on satire.  Jack Nicholson's over the top and enjoyable portrayal of The Joker is such an instance and Danny DeVito is quite funny as the Penguin.  This approach, contrasted with Tim Burton's dark and forboding (and wonderful) production design, gives these two films their interesting and edgy atmosphere which is missing from the two succeeding films of this series.  I've always thought that Michael Keaton was a fine Batman and players such as Michelle Pfeiffer, Christopher Walken, Kim Basinger and Jack Palance all add to the enjoyment, as does Michael Gough, drolly playing Bruce Wayne's valet.  He is fondly remembered as the young businessman in the brilliant Alec Guiness comedy \\"The Man in the White Suit\\"  from the British Ealing Studios in 1951!  Happily, he is still active in the business.  The quality of \\"Batman Returns\\" in Blu-ray is superb in detail and color definition and  technically  superior, I think, to the Blu-ray of \\"Batman\\", a film made only  three years before.  And for some reason that I can't quite figure out, the audio quality of this disc and most other Blu-rays I've auditioned is significantly superior in clarity and dynamic range to equivalent earlier DVD releases.  Perhaps audio quality is simply being given more attention these days -- a happy state of affairs if so.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|Rapper Nas (Son of Jazz Musician Olu Dara), and Reggae artist, Damian 'Jr. Gong' Marley (Son of the legendary Bob Marley) deliver a truly unique listening experience. Though, as artists who excel in their respective fields, it isn't really a surprise to many that their joint LP is pure gold.    The bulk of the production is handled by Marley, and it consists of an array of innovative rhythms never before heard on a rap or reggae album. Distant Relatives opens up with one of these unconventional tracks, simply titled, 'As We Enter'. This is a really bouncy track that is meant to solidify the duo's readiness. I loved this song because of how intense it was and Nas did a great job with the hook. This chorus is catchy but it also establishes the duo's dominance in the worlds of hiphop and reggae. \\"The kings is [are] back, time to return the crown\\"    The album doesn't continue down the road of intensity however. After the first 3 tracks or so things get fairly mellow. This isn't bad though, because the songs are still good. Just don't expect to be pumping your fists all the way throughout the LP.    Things start to heat up again at 'Dispear' which clearly has more of an African influence to it. The whole song feels very tribal and aggressive. It's as if someone where being chased through a jungle of some sorts. The lyrics are also very impressive and I'm reminded of the brilliance of Nas' last Untitled LP when I hear him speak again.    After Dispear, things only continue to get better. 'Land of Promise' is an amazing song, and more Reggae/Bob Marley esque than anything else presented to us thus far. I thought it was great because it showed that although these two are doing something completely different, they can still pull back and add elements of their original selves, when needed.    'My Generation' is the infamous song that includes a Lil Wayne feature. Surprisingly, his verse isn't too \\"different\\" so he isn't the burden that fans thought he would initially be. Thechorus is a lovely culmination of children's voices singing, speaking on how their generation will change the world. Aww     Things end on a beautiful note with the catchy, \\"Africa Must Wake Up\\". I first heard this song on a performance video and I was blow away by how good it was. This is also the kind of song that has a good message, which is always an added bonus. The perfect way to close out an amazing, AMAZING CD    Iumak gives this album a 10/10. If you buy one CD this year, let it be this one. Don't download it for free, purchase this however you can. Music is terrible these days (See my other CD Reviews for details lol) so when we get good music, we have to support and appreciate it. I encourage everyone who hasn't tried Distant Relatives out, to go out and buy this right now.
8862933177|5.0|Thank you for my Moleskine Passions Film Journal, it's perfect!  I love the deep black cover embossed with various movie-related symbols like a director's chair and box of popcorn.  It gives the cover an interesting look and feel. All 234 pages are perfect, with alphabetized tabs to list all my favorite movies, along with information such as the director, actors, quotes, genre, awards, and my rating and opinion.  I also like that there is an insert included that tells me where I can go to download and print off additional pages to add to my journal. I like the fact that Moleskine has thoughtfully left 71 pages either blank or lined so that I can also create my own pages if I want.  And the two accordion style pockets in the back are perfect for holding old ticket stubs and the 202 stickers that I can use to further personalize the pages of my notebook.  The three silky ribbons sewn into the top of my notebook will come in handy for holding my place.  The film festival listing in the front of the notebook is impressive as well, I only wish I could go.  Well, maybe someday.<br /><br />It's obvious that you and your coworkers put a great deal of care and attention into the planning and creation of my journal and I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate it.  This kind of craftsmanship is rare in today's world and should be applauded when it makes its appearance.<br /><br />Thank you very much for my Passions Film Journal.  I absolutely love it and will fill it to the brim with my favorite movies.<br /><br />Your fan,<br />Bucky
0393072231|5.0|Vintage Lewis, and that means it is hard to put down. No matter how much I thought I knew about the crisis, I understood it much better after reading The Big Short. The \\"but\\" in the title is because Lewis applies his analytical abilities to refining observations, not to being particularly insightful. I was telling someone how much I enjoyed the book and they asked: \\"What should be done differently in the future?\\" and I wasn't equipped to answer.    What this book gave me was perspective: I have a much more nuanced view whenever anyone asserts some simplistic \\"cause\\" for the crisis. I now think: \\"It is more complicated than that but not necessarily better.\\"    I highly recommend this book. I wish there was a way for Kindle owners/users (like me, though I got this one in paper) to express dissatisfaction without giving the content bad reviews.
0792163710|4.0|I liked this old Western movie a lot, characters are convincing even when one considers modern standards. Visual quality of movie is average but then again it was done with old techniques
B00362DRQS|4.0|Duran Duran became mega stars after their second album, Rio, became a smash hit worldwide thanks in equal parts to radio friendly songs and glamorous videos. Their third album, the bizarrely titled Seven & The Ragged Tiger, is again filled with big hooks and hits, but also with a bit more of an edge. The album's first single, \\"Union Of The Snake\\" is one of their most challenging and experimental songs. The song has a catchy hook built around a slinky guitar riff and a Moroccan vibe. There is a jazzy saxophone solo in the break and is flush with synth flourishes that give the song a mysterious and sensual sound. It peaked at number three on the charts. \\"New Moon On Monday\\" was the second single and is a straightforward song in the classic new romantic vein. The band produced a Thriller like, 20-minute video to accompany the song involving some bizarre underground resistance group in France. It helped propel the song to peak at number ten. The third single became the band's first US number one, \\"The Reflex\\". The album version differs from the single, which was remixed, as it doesn't have the female vocals that are some prominent in the single version (the single version is included on disk two). It is still catchy and quite memorable and one can tell upon first listen why it was smash hit. Other songs have a shiny sound including \\"(I'm Looking For) Cracks In The Pavement\\" and \\"I Take The Dice\\". The last two songs return the band to the edgier sound that appeared on the last few tracks on their first album. The haunting instrumental \\"Tiger Tiger\\" segues into the hauntingly beautiful \\"The Seventh Stranger\\" creating two of the finest moments in the band's history.  The deluxe edition includes a full disc of remixes, live cuts and dance versions that is a nice addition as well as a superb dvd disk with videos including lives performances and a documentary.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|after road to zion iv alaways wanted a another collab with these two but i didnt expect an album. this works way better than some of the stuff jay z has tried to do with r kelly and lincin park althou the linkin park album had a few good songs the album as a whole was not good. this album is really good from start to finish. i like this more than nas last album to be honest. if your a nas or marley fan youl like this, hip hop needs more efforts like this if it wants to come back. and buy the album cuz profits go to building schools in africa    My fav tracks:  -as we enter  -freinds  -land of promise  -Naw mean  -patience  -africa must wake up
B0039TD7RC|5.0|Exile On Main St. is a murky, muddy, brilliant album. It sounds like they it recorded it at four a.m. after spending a night curled up with a bottles of Jack Daniels & Jim Beam at their side. The band at the time was spiraling down into a pit of drug addiction and complete decadence and the album takes us into that world. The album was recorded and produced to give us the feeling of despair and dirtiness. The Stones have always been fascinated by and included elements from the music of the American Deep South. Those influences show up all over the album. From the gospel sound of what very well may be their greatest single \\"Tumbling Dice\\", the Memphis horns on \\"Rocks Off\\" & \\"Happy\\", the Mississippi Delta blues of \\"Torn & Frayed\\", \\"Turd On The Run\\" & \\"Venilator Blues\\", the Alabama dirges of \\"Loving Cup\\", \\"Sweet Virginia\\", & \\"Shine A Light\\" to the electric boogie of \\"Rip This Joint\\" & \\"All Down The Line\\", the band takes us on a musical tour-de-force. You can argue whether this is the best Stones album of all time, but you what you can't argue is that Exile On Main Street deserves to be right near the top of the discussion.
B003DT194G|5.0|This is an extraordinary movie. It just goes to show how a lot of snob critics can't understand genius when they see it. Granted, that many critics saw a cut version when the movie was first released  but after many saw the full version  they still didn't remotely recognize how great a movie this is.Fortunately, that injustice has been mostly remedied nowadays. There isn't another movie where the story is so completely integrated with the music and the music is some of the greatest music ever written by anybody at any time period. The Mcbain massacre scene for me is the greatest five minutes or so in movie history. The sense of foreboding at the beginning of the scene with uneasy moments of silence mixed  with blowing dust, tumbleweed and howling winds is used with a magical, almost oneiric effect. The wide panorama shots with the flying birds later combined with the violence of the massacre give a tragic poetry to the scene. After the massacre we hear the footsteps of Timmy running towards the door of the house and get a close up of his shocked, disbelieving, gaze fixed upon his massacred father, brother and sister. This is accompanied by an extraordinary musical score from the genius mind of Ennio Morricone which epitomizes the overwhelming tragedy that Timmy feels at the annihilation of his family members who only seconds before were planning for a bright future which is abruptly truncated by lethal gunshots.The music in this setting is as great as listening to Beethoven's Fifth or Ninth symphonies. Then we have the extraordinary camera shot which at the beginning doesn't show the mass murderers but slowly pans around to show a tobacco chewing cold faced Henry Fonda accompanied by his four minions. Fonda's mien slowly turns into a sadistic smile which shows what type of person we will be dealing with throughout the movie;someone who doesn't even wince at killing an innocent little boy. Throughout the movie we are privileged to witness extraordinary facial close ups with wide angle views of techniscope scenes. Particulary impressive is the opening duel between Charles Bronson, Jack Elam, Woody Strode and Al Mulock, not to mention the prolonged comic,and at the same time tense build up leading to that scene. Another great scene is near the end when the flashback of what drives Bronson throughout the movie to seek vengeance against Fonda is revealed.The background to Monument Valley with a reddish arch gives another poetic yet very violent touch to this scene. Henry Fonda's sadistic satisfaction at seeing the suffering going on between Bronson, as a boy having to hold his brother on his shoulders while doing everything in his power from preventing his brother from falling down and being hung just makes you happy to see Fonda bite the dust and fall to the ground  with a harmonica in his mouth just as had happened when Bronson fell down(or was kicked off by his brother) as a boy with a harmonica in his mouth leading to his brother's death. The story is basically a simple revenge story but which has an epic almost otherworldly quality with the background of the wild west and the change the railroad is about to initiate in North America.The greatness of this movie is not in the story itself but in the way it is presented.There is a lot more to say about how great this movie is but I think a book would be needed to cover all the subtleties that can be found in this movie.
B003ELKNOK|4.0|Slippery When Wet is the album that propelled Jon Bon Jovi and his bandmates from open act to major league headliners. Often they are dismissed as a 80's hair metal band, admittingly there is nothing on this album that will make you forget Springsteen or the Beatles, but it is unfair to lump them in with that genre. Although they had the look down (big hair, torn jeans etc.), unlike the other bands, they actually have a good ear for a melody and wrote good songs. Songs like the number one hits \\"You Give Love A Bad Name\\" & \\"Livin' On A Prayer\\" show their diversity. The former is a straight ahead rocker and the latter a moody number. \\"Wanted Dead Or Alive\\" is a classic rock epic that aspires for greatness. Lesser known songs like \\"I'd Die For You\\", \\"Social Disease\\" & \\"Raise Your Hands\\" are solid songs. The lyrics sometimes fall into tired cliche terrority and the music is a little too slick in places, you have give the band an A for effort and genuiness. The album is just good fun.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|The original album was perfectly imperfect when it was originally released.  Recorded bare bones in a basement with a mobile truck it was raw, energetic, rock n' roll.  The remastered tracks have been given new life while not completely removing what made this album great in the first place.  I could have done without the alternate takes of tracks as I have heard them before, but the new, unlreleased tracks are worth a listen or so.  Some may not like the new vocals over the old tracks, but I think it is a cool interpretation and a revisit to songs that were recorded many years ago.  The Stones are still rocking and take over the world with every new thing they do.  This is no different.  Exile was always my favorite album, now I have an extended version of the album.  It's great.    Not many bands today are doing anything remotely close to what the Stones did in the 70s or what they did with Exile.  The only recent album I can think of which even resembles what was done during the recording of Exile (the style, the rawness, the gritty rock) is Torn and Frayed by Lone Shark which seems like an obvious nod to Exile.
B00362DRNG|4.0|Duran Duran's self-titled debut was released in the UK in 1981 and was a smash hit. The album did not catch on in the US. It took the release of the band's second album Rio and the inventive videos that were staples on MTV to propel this album into the US top ten two years later in 1983. As an added attraction the re-release featured a new song, the number four hit, \\"Is There Something I Should Know?\\". This remastered version is the original English version minus that track. The first five tracks, which comprised the album's first side, are songs that in the traditional DD vein. The first two tracks, \\"Girls On Film\\" and \\"Planet Earth\\" are the most familiar and still sound great twenty-three years later. \\"Careless Memories\\" was a minor hit in America and \\"Anyone Out There\\" and \\"To The Shore\\" embodies the pop sensibilities that made the group a success. The final four songs are a complete 180-degree turn from the first five. They are atmospheric, moody and brooding numbers that find the band turning inward and introspective. The band has always sited Roxy Music as big influences and they are never more so then on these four tracks. \\"Night Boat\\" is a foreboding track and the album's final number, the instrumental \\"Tel Aviv\\" is quite haunting. The deluxe edition features a second disk with some demos and the extended \\"night versions\\" of some songs.  There also is a bonus dvd with the videos that helped make Duran Duran a MTV sensation included the uncensored version of Girls on Film.  After watching it you can see why it was edited for MTV!

B002U0KHMY|5.0|I was hooked on this series from the first ep, it is just a good clean FUN family show. The chemistry between the actors is wonderful and hey the eye candy is not bad either.

0385532458|5.0|Mr. Grisham can write when he is not so occupied by spinning a nice yarn that can readily be turned into a movie. Ford County is a collection of seven short stories, each lasting for about 40 pages. But don't let the short length of the story fool you, for each and every one of them is exquisitely crafted. A mark of a good story teller is when he (or she) can engage the reader through many short stories. Because every short story has to start afresh in introducing new characters to the reader, a master story teller must succeed in commanding the attention of the reader to the latest protagonist. In that respect, Mr. Grisham is simply superlative in the book. All the stories are set in Clanton, Mississippi, the scene of Grisham's best book, A Time To Kill. Some characters even make a repeat appearance (remember Harry Rex Vonner?)  The book contain poignant vignettes on how a white man deals with AIDS in the 1980's by being forced to move to Lowtown, the ironically named area of Clanton where all the blacks are segregated. There is a story on how the apathy of a lawyer ruins a family and another on how a mother and two sons cope with a sibling on death row. These and the other four stories are simply too good to put down. I would heartily recommend this book to fans --- both new and returning ones --- of Mr. Grisham.
B002NWRMVS|3.0|I like this album, and I love Nora Jones' voice, but I have to admit, I don't like it as much as her previous, more jazzy albums.

B001QOGYFY|4.0|\\"Whiteout\\" is a movie I had limited expectations for, mainly because of its confusing ad campaign that was unclear if it was a suspense thriller or a supernatural thriller.  I took a chance on it, mainlt due to the presence of Kate Beckinsale, and wow, I was surprised how strong of a thriller this is.  Set in Antarctica, Beckinsale plays a US Marshall who represents the only law enforcement officer on the continent, which is handy when the first murder in the continent's history takes place.  Many suspects abound, all centering on a crashed freight plane from the 1950s, the contents of which are unclear.  Her only ally is a grizzled doctor and survivalist, played by Tom Skerritt and sn FBI agent flown in at the last minute to help investigate.  Did I mention the handful of occupants left are stranded inside sue to lethally cold temperatures, and there's a storm coming... \\"Whiteout\\" is the kind of thriller we don't see much anymore. An intelligent, skillfully made, old-fashioned suspenser in the tradition of Agatha Christie.  I was impressed by the film's stress in character and not just the axe-wielding maniac loose in the compound.  It also gave a lot of details about what life is like in the compound, and every time I would ask a question in my mind, the movie would answer it, leaving me satisfied and exhilarated by the time the credits roll.  Beckinsale is terrific.  She looks fabulous, but portrays toughness and vulnerability very well here, expecially when we hear why she chose to police Antarctica.  Tom Skerritt is superb.  He is a great example of an actor who has transitioned from leading man to character actor, and he brings heft and credibility to the proceedings.  The special effects used to create the environment are convincing, and the movie lets the action roll, but doesn't cheat the details.  When our heroine has to have fingers amputated from frostbite, it is clear the rules are different in this thriller.  I strongly recommend this.  Lots of surprises for a thriller we feel like we have seen before.  It reminds me why I enjoyed \\"X-Files:  I Want to Believe\\".  In that film (also set in a frozen and haunting landscape), the space felt tangible, the characters fully developed, and it didn't go for stupid-ass thrills that are cheap and insulting.  The emphasis on character and detail elevates \\"Whiteout\\" to a superior thriller and gives the more expected chases, carnage, and action scenes more credible.    Framed in a very cinematic 2:40, the blu-ray transfer looks amazing.  The detail in the compounds are shown down to the finest chips of paint.  Nice VC-1 1080p tranfer boasts terrifc detail, contrast and color saturation.  The effects look great even under the scrutiny of high def.  The sound is a robust Dolby TrueHD 5.1 lossless endcode.  The storms, plows, plane crashes, and music are all superb, plenty of bass to shake the house, with crisp dialogue reproduction.  SD cannot render the detail on a movie like this with shadowy contrast and stark whites.  The BD covers it beautifully.  Highly recommended.  The movie is excellent if you are a fan for old-school thrillers.

1416550550|5.0|I loved the Forgotten Garden.<br /><br />I do not want to spoil it for anyone so I will be careful here. There are three main stories in one. Each grows like sweet honey suckle intertwining with the others but never fear, each character is well fleshed out and a woman of her own. The texture and dept of the landscapes makes you able to feel, smell and touch each era being visited.<br /><br />The portion that takes place on Battersea Church Road is exactly as my Grandfather would tell of his childhood growing up on the river in the late 1880's early 1890's.<br /><br />This is a well researched, well written book of which Ms. Morton should be very proud. I'll be reading anything she puts out in the near future.
B002ZBT84G|5.0|Although this CD is short it does not fail to deliver a performance that is breathtaking. Gil Scott-Heron is a true master of the spoken word. The way he weaves his poetry and social views with the music makes the listener to notice and think about the issues at hand. At first I was disappointed that this CD is only around 28 minutes long but that disappointment evaporated by the time the title song, I'M NEW HERE was playing. I have had at one point all of Gil Scott-Heron's albums but have not had the chance to find the CD versions which I plan to remedy some day soon. I'M NEW HERE is fresh and provocative - a true pleasure.[[ASIN:B0027ST8W4 Bridges]][[ASIN:B000002WAW The Revolution Will Not Be Televised]]

B002BU0DPE|4.0|I have to start with the hissing concerns. Because there is hope.<br /><br />The hissing is a very real issue. As the volume is turned up on the cable, hissing becomes more pronounced, as does an electronic whine. But I have narrowed down the problem to the fact that the headset supplies its own pre-amp in the cable line. So if you connect this headset directly to the left/right RCA cables supplied, you are definitely going to deal with a persistent hissing at louder volumes.<br /><br />HOWEVER, there is a workaround that made this a tremendous buy for me and my set up. If you have an amplifier or TV with a headphone jack, plug the audio directly into that jack instead of using the RCA connections. (This may require buying a $5 adapter to take the 1/8 inch jack up to a 1/4 inch jack in some cases. It may also require your PS3 to be moved to a position closer to the headphone jack for using the USB chat connector.)<br /><br />What this does is allows you to turn down the in-line pre-amp to a level where the hiss disappears, while compensating for sound levels with your TV or surround sound system's volume. When I did this, the difference was night and day.<br /><br />So what about the sound?<br /><br />I must say it is surprisingly crisp and clean. Plus, hooked up to my Dolby 5.1 system via the headphone jack, the headset did a remarkable job at simulating a surround sound experience. As I moved around people talking in-game, I could hear voices shift all the way around my head. I credit this both to the amplifier having a two-channel Dolby simulator built-in and from using the in-line expander function on the headset line.<br /><br />The in-line bass enhancer was also surprisingly good. It added just enough rumble to make gaming immersive, without muddying the sound.<br /><br />Chat, though, is the biggest plus for the headset. The sound is crisp and clear and the microphone (even on my huge 7-7/8 head) was able to reach my lips for quiet talking, while still picking my voice when moved away for normal talking. I especially like the ability to hear myself (and the room around me, coincidentally), which made talking more natural. The chat enhancer also does a good job of raising chat volume automatically during noisy gameplay sequences. And the in-line chat volume is great for those times I just want game audio.<br /><br />Only con for me is that the mute for chat is a slider switch. Should have been a push button, but I'll survive. And I will restate that without having an amplifier to plug these into I would have been returning these things the very same day. The RCA solution is simply not very good, but the headphone jack one is spectacular.<br /><br />Hope this helps.<br /><br />Bobally like the ability to hear myself (and the room around me, coincidentally), which made talking more natural.

B0029358GM|3.0|Falling somewhere between the airy and relaxed SKY BLUE SKY, and the experimental cacophony named A GHOST IS BORN, is WILCO (THE ALBUM).  This album features some of Wilco's very best songs, including \\"Wilco (The Song)\\", \\"Bull Black Nova\\", and \\"You Never Know\\", with the last song feeling like it could make Christine McVie jealous for having not written it.    The other eight songs are absolute filler.  If they're not generic anthems of love (\\"You And I\\", \\"I'll Fight\\") or quirky to the point of killing the song (\\"Deeper Down\\", \\"One Wing\\"), then they're retreads of earlier songs (\\"Sonny Feeling\\") or are so aimless that they float away (\\"Country Disappeared\\", \\"Solataire\\", \\"Everlasting Everything\\").  Had the bad taken another three years to produce this album, it might have been a little more focused.  Unfortunately, it seems like Tweedy's new-found confidence has churned out a half-assed product this time around.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|I couldn't be more thrilled that MTV has FINALLY released DARIA on DVD.  All the episodes and movies are here, with excellent sound and picture, and presented in their original running length.*    There's not much more that can be said about this clever, underdog show that hasn't already been said.  There's definitely something special about this show (in the field of animation, specifically) that other shows before almost matched, but definitely hasn't been replicated since.  Relive the shows in better quality than you've ever seen ;-)    [* A Caveat.  The music on the shows HAS been replaced, but it is well-chosen and works almost as well as the originals.  Why else do people CARE so much about the music except to play \\"Name That Song\\"?  The shows wouldn't have gotten released any other way and we knew that ahead of time - deal with it.  Also, the movie IS IT COLLEGE YET? is presented in its edited form.  Apparently the movie was only shown in its longer version when it originally premiered, and after reading the original script, the cuts make sense and aren't really missed.]    La, la, laaa, la la...

B0017R5UAA|2.0|VERY disappointed in this one.  After I saw the band perform on SNL, I was intrigued and thought this was the breath of fresh air I was looking for - not true.  This album is HIGHLY derivative of any folk-rock band from the late 60s/70s; Crosby, Stills & Nash, Cat Stevens, America - take your pick.  The first few minutes of the album were gripping, until I realized that every song sounded exactly alike: canned vocals, overblown harmonies, drippy lyrics and half-baked melodies.  Even the cover is trying too hard to look retro-folksy; you can't push all these throwbacks too much or you just become a gimmick, and that's exactly what they've done here.    I have to admit that I haven't completely written off the band as of yet.  They're working on a new album that should be released later this year and it supposedly is less poppy and more jam-like.  This might better suit the band and could yield a good album, but there certainly isn't one to be found here.

B0038QMREA|4.0|The Tallest Man on Earth's Wild Hunt album is fantastic, because it isn't overproduced, for one. It highlights what is best about this singer: an incredible voice that demands attention, simple yet beautiful melodies, and insightful lyrics.    Sometimes, less is more. And in this case, that phrase rings true. If you like folk music, or are tired of mainstream radio and want to hear something new, give this CD a listen. You won't be disappointed.

B003AO1SVS|1.0|I will review this very simply by making a distinction between the band that the Black Keys used to be, and the band they have evolved into.<br /><br />If you like older Black Keys albums (The Big Come Up, Thickfreakness, Rubber Factory and about half of Magic Potion) and did NOT like their newer efforts, you will probably not like this album.<br />If you like newer Black Keys albums (half of Magic Potion and all but two of the songs on Attack and Release) and Dan Auerbach's solo album but weren't crazy about their original material, you'll love this album.<br />If you like everything the Black Keys have done, you'll likely love this album.<br /><br />As a long time fan of the keys who madly loves their first 3 albums, I am sadly distressed to see that they have left much of their roots behind.  The grooving, overdriven (and at times dissonant) guitar riffs are sorely lacking on this entire album.  The simple yet infectious jams are gone.  The boiled down & dirty production that brought their roughened version of this decade's resurgent blues/rock mix has been replaced with over produced melodic elevator music where Dan often sings at the far reaches of his upper register instead of growling out the hooks like he used to.<br /><br />I understand that musician's must evolve, but this is not evolution....it's watering down. Their albums used to be a representation of their musical style.  It was drums and guitar and vocals - raw and unrestrained.  This album (much like the last) is so overproduced that the drums often sound like a hip-hop drum machine and the layered flute loops are atrocious.  This isn't a sound they can reproduce live without adding many more members to their stage show.  It isn't a real representation of the music they used to make.<br /><br />If you like where the Keys have transitioned to, you'll love this as they are talented musicians with real skill.  I just don't like the direction they've taken their music.  If, like me, you fell in love with them when they still rocked instead of making over produced watered down ballads.....well...simply put...don't waste your time.of making over produced watered down ballads.....well...simply put...don't waste your time.
0321344758|5.0|We may not all create web sites, but we're all affected by the web and reading books like these would help everyone find some common ground and break through the current web impasse: After all this time most sites are still mostly useless pretty visuals (if even that) and we seem stuck on a string of technologies and fads: blogs, podcasts, facebook, twitter... chatroulette?    This book is well written, easy to read, and has plenty of examples. Even seasoned players will find it useful if only as part of their conceptual framework, and to say \\"Amen brother\\" from time to time.    My only problem is with the book physically, sheets have begun to fall off and I'm the only one that's read it... Poor usability when you're trying to read and hold the book together...
B002RKSCA6|4.0|It is nice to be able to have great access to a classic story like this one. A Great story that shows that we all have some sort of alternate personality burried within us and that sometimes it gets the best of us. It is good to know how the original story pans out in the massive retelling of this story that are out there.
0439023491|4.0|The powerhouse that was The Hunger Games slides directly into Catching Fire. Katniss and Peeta are Victors of the Games, and they're settling into their new life of stardom. The country is enamored with the two young lovebirds, forcing Katniss to pretend like she reciprocates Peeta's true feelings. But there is unrest afoot in Panem, and all-out rebellion threatens the peace of the Capitol.<br /><br />I felt this book was not as powerful and breathtaking as the first in the series, but it still told an exhilarating story that left me wanting more as the last page turned. The 75th Hunger Games was very exciting, and I particularly enjoyed the innovations Collins designed.<br /><br />Like many second books in a trilogy, Catching Fire seemed like a transitional book, where characters get flushed out and pieces get positioned. That's not to say that the story isn't great, but it's just not as good as The Hunger Games.<br /><br />Overall, Catching Fire is a must read if you're interested in the story. It offers rich prose, vivid imagination, and a story that begs to be read. I'm eagerly awaiting the conclusion of this wonderful trilogy.
B002SRQ214|5.0|A very fast CPU and a very reasonable price. I am very satisfied with the performance so far.
0439023483|5.0|The world is changed, yet eerily familiar, in Suzanne Collins' fantastic novel The Hunger Games.  In the country of Panem, Katniss Everdeen is getting ready for the Reaping.  Every year, children between the ages of twelve and eighteen have their names put in a lottery.  Two names are selected from each of the twelve Districts, one boy, one girl.  The twenty-four people are then rushed off to the Arena in brutal combat on live television for the pleasure of the citizens of the Capitol.  And while the Capitol people laugh and bet on the odds, the rest of the people of Panem watch on, rooting for the success of their district's tributes, and praying that their kids will make it through the fray.  These Games serve as an annual reminder of what happens when you go against the Capitol.<br /><br />Collins has constructed a mesmerizing world filled with characters to love and loathe.  The people of the twelve districts are burdened and oppressed.  Food is always scarce.  Freedom is severely limited.  Panem is not a pretty place to live, unless you live in the Capitol.  Many of the ideas aren't necessarily original, but the story is so well done and well written that it's impossible not to like.<br /><br />Katniss, a 16-year-old girl, lives in District 12 with her mother and her little sister.  She spends most of free time illegally hunting and using the game to provide for her family.  Her life is hard, but manageable.  Her father died in a mining accident, leaving her mother a shell of a woman.<br /><br />I find it difficult to say a lot about The Hunger Games without going into spoiler territory.  I haven't cared about characters like this in a long time.  Katniss is an excellent protagonist.  Smart and witty when she needs to be, but still a teenager, occasionally thick-headed and silly.  In fact, every character in this book is one of high quality imagination.  The Tributes are all pitiable, but highly intriguing.  The supporting cast--Cinna, Haymitch, and even Effie--all appear like real people that have cares and worries.<br /><br />The plot is very fast paced, told in a first-person POV through Katniss.  I read the book as an audio copy and thought it was well done.  I was eager to pick the story back up and see the fates of the people I'd grown to care for.<br /><br />I can't think of anything that I disliked other than the fact that some of Katniss' realizations sometimes take too long to come to fruition.  Then I need to remember that she's a young girl with a lot on her mind and I shrug it off.<br /><br />Overall, The Hunger Games is an amazing read.  Characterization is top-notch.  The writing style is very smooth.  The word usage is often spot-on and perfect.  And the story is simply breathtaking.  If you're looking for something dystopic, totalitarian, and post-apocalyptic, then definitely read The Hunger Games.

B003AO1SVS|4.0|Although the Black Keys have been extremely active recently, with both band members releasing an album from a side project ([[ASIN:B001NKWLGW Keep It Hid]] from Auerbach and [[ASIN:B002LWJ5WO Feel Good Together]] from Carney), plus the hip-hop/rap collaboration [[ASIN:B0034PWPLK BlakRoc]], Brothers could be said to pick up where [[ASIN:B000GPIPD8 Magic Potion]] left off in 2006 - four years ago. With catchy, often heavily distorted guitar riffs and deep, bluesy lyrics, Brothers relies on overall quality songwriting, not editing done after the songs have been laid down (as seemed to be the case in 2008's Danger Mouse produced [[ASIN:B0013K6WLM Attack and Release]]) - with the exception of the track \\"Tighten Up\\". As such, Brothers will appeal to those who enjoyed The Black Keys first few albums, but some of the initial excitement in those albums hasn't quite made it to 2010. For better or worse, as the Black Keys have matured, comparisons to the frenetic Jack White and the White Stripes have seemed less and less appropriate. Nowhere on Brothers are the instantly fun songs like \\"Do the Rump,\\" \\"Set You Free,\\" \\"10 A.M. Automatic,\\" \\"Till I Get My Way\\" (or most of [[ASIN:B0002O06N0 Rubber Factory]], for that matter). There are, however, some real gems, including \\"Everlasting Light,\\" \\"Black Mud,\\" \\"Unknown Brother\\" and \\"Never Gonna Give You Up\\".<br /><br />All that said, Brothers is a quality album worth picking up, especially for fans of the Black Keys' original philosophy. Compared to other Black Keys albums, Brothers earns about 3.5 stars, but compared to everything else out there, Brothers easily deserves a 4.
B003CN5B6K|5.0|This network has managed to come up with some real winners in the last few years and this one is a standout.  The last show that had this kind of chemistry for me was Moonlighting.  The two main characters play off each other so well.  It is written well and that allows you to overlook some of the more outrageous things that have to happen in a one hour program.  This is precisely why I cannot bear to watch a CSI or House or Gray's Anatomy.  There are so many cast members that need screen time and the writing is horrible.  I can never look past how they solve a crime or cure a patient in 40 minutes.  While Mr. Bomer is a new face to me, he seems like he has been acting for years.  Other characters in the show are somewhat familiar but not to the point that they are pigeonholed into a certain role.  All of the main characters seem to fit quite well together and I hope they continue to concentrate on the relationship between Neal and Peter.  That is the meat of the show.  I think I read somewhere that Matt Bomer was from the Houston area.  Go Matt!

0316069906|5.0|This book was the beginning of a total life change for me.  I never knew about the horrors of animal agriculture and how widespread the effects are.  I picked this book up because Foer is one of my favorite authors.  I was actually disappointed at first when I heard that he wrote a nonfiction book, because I was dying for another novel from him.  However, I am sooooo happy that he wrote this book.  It touched my life, changed my life.  I am now a vegan for life.      The book is written brilliantly with the style you would expect from Foer.  He is a true creative genius.  But more importantly, he is getting an important message out there into the world that many people are unaware of.  I think that this book is a starting point that will lead you to explore a lot of other information about factory farming and the absolute unhealthiness of an animal based diet.     I would recommend The Food Revolution by John Robbins as a companion to this book.  Also, The Kind Diet by Alicia Silverstone.  There is a wealth of information out there, you just need to find what speaks to you and helps you make a real difference in this world.  The world needs all the help it can get.  Good luck on your journey.

B001NXDSLG|4.0|I bought this blu ray set last year before realizing that there were exclusive performances and featurettes on different versions from Amazon and Target. The packaging is clever, but I would have preferred a standard blu ray case.    I ended up selling it and getting the blu ray from amazon.co.uk. It comes in a standard blu ray case and features all 6 of the extra performances and 7 extra featurettes from Amazon and Target. The blu ray is region free and plays fine in us blu ray players. It is currently around $20. Definitely the way to go to get everything.    http://www.amazon.co.uk/Woodstock-Blu-ray-Jimi-Hendrix/dp/B001V7P2MM/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=dvd&qid=1274286271&sr=8-1
0451228731|4.0|I liked it - a fun read.    The only thing I will add is the jacket and first few pages are covered with pronouncements about how REAL the technology is, as in, \\"This could really happen!\\"   No it could not.  I won't dissect it but you will enjoy it more if you do not go in with a literal interpretation of the gushing of the endorsements.  Many things could not happen but most of all the Daemon.  Daemon's are nothing more then IF THEN ELSE statements, but the book's Daemon shows much more creative control and non-linerar decisions than such a programming structure allows.      So my advice is to know that it is fiction with a very liberal stretching of current technology.

B003L0HZ5O|4.0|I haven't been a Black Keys fan very long.  In fact, just ran across the albums Attack & Release, and Magic Potion about a year ago.  Then came across their recent Hip Hop collaboration Blakroc.  I loved all three!      With that being said, their new album Brothers is a nice mixture of all of the sounds I have heard on the above three albums.  There are a few tracks such as Next Girl, Black Mud, and She's Long Gone that will have you drumming along with the heavy rock and blues sounds.  Then you get a few tracks like Everlasting Light and Sinister Kid that have beats that seem to have come straight off the Blakroc album.  There are also a handfull of tracks like I'm Not The One and These Days that slow it down and really stress the lyrics.    I'm not a long time fan, so I don't have the back catalog to base any other comparisons on.  Some people are saying that it isn't like the Black Keys earlier realeses - I wouldn't know.    Overall, I gave the album a 4 because it doesn't seem to have a single identity.  All of the tracks by themselves are excellent, but the album just seems to jump around quite a bit.

B00275EGWY|2.0|This movie was all right, didn't deserve the Oscar, but meh, it was ok.  It's a war movie that will be completely forgotten within a year, maybe two.  That said, Nicholas Chartier, the moron who produced this film has waged war on Net privacy and neutrality.  He's suing anyone who downloaded this movie and thinks that all peopl who stream or torrent films are thieves.  Like Metallica, the guys a petty idiot that can't recognize the difference between theft and copyright infringment.      I deeply regret paying money to rent this movie partially because it's a forgettable film but mostly because that money went to Nicholas Chartier.      A movie best skipped, but if you're going to watch it, torrent it or obtain it via some other method that doesn't put any money in Nicholas Chartier's pocket.  And boycott all future films he's involved in.  Maybe he'll go away.
0375757813|4.0|Even the best authors in the world sometimes put out something that... well, isn't up to their usual standards. For Jane Austen, that book was \\"Mansfield Park\\" -- her prose is typically excellent, and she weaves a memorable story about a poor young lady in the middle of a wealthy, dysfunctional family. But put bluntly, Fanny Price lacks the depth and complexity of Austen's other heroines.<br /><br />As a young girl, Fanny Price was sent from her poor family to live with her wealth relatives, the Bertrams, and was raised along with her four cousins Tom, Edmund, Maria and Julia.<br /><br />Despite being regarded only little better than a servant (especially by the fawning, cheap Mrs. Norris), Fanny is pretty happy -- especially since Edmund is kind and supportive of her at all times. But then the charming, fashionable Crawford sibilings arrive in the neighborhood, sparking off some love triangles (particularly between Maria and Henry Crawford, even though she's already engaged.<br /><br />And the whole thing becomes even more confused when Henry becomes intrigued by Fanny's refusal to be charmed by him as the others are. But when she rejects his proposal, she ends up banished from her beloved Mansfield Park... right before a devastating scandal and a perilous illness strikes the Bertram family. Does Fanny still have a chance at love and the family she's always been with?<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Mansfield Park\\" is Fanny Price -- even Austen's own mother didn't like her. She's a very flat, virtuously dull heroine for this story; unlike Austen's other heroines she doesn't have much personality growth or a personal flaw to overcome. And despite being the protagonist, Fanny seems more like a spectator on the outskirts of the plot until the second half (when she has a small but pivotal part to play in the story).<br /><br />Fortunately she's the only real flaw in this book. Austen's stately, vivid prose is full of deliciously witty moments (Aunt Norris \\"consoled herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others). And she inserts some pointed commentary on people who care more about society's opinions than on morality.<br /><br />And the other characters in the book are pretty fascinating as well -- especially since Edmund, despite being a virtuous clergyman-in-training, is an intelligent and strong-willed man. The Bertrams are a rather dysfunctional family with a stern patriarch, a fluttery ethereal mother, a playboy heir and a couple of spoiled girls -- Maria in particular develops a crush on Henry, but doesn't bother to break off her engagement until it's too late. And the Crawfords are all flash and sparkle: a pair of charming, shallow people who are essentially hollow.<br /><br />\\"Mansfield Park\\" suffers from a rather insipid heroine, but the rest of the book is vintage Austen -- lies, romance, scandal and a dance of manners and society.d herself for the loss of her husband by considering that she could do very well without him\\"), some tastefully-handled scandal, and a delicate house-of-romantic-cards that comes crashing down to ruin people's lives (and improve others).

B002ITB3PM|5.0|Jermaine and Bret are a pair of New Zealand musicians, living in New York City and hoping to hit it big. Yeah, \\"Flight of the Conchords: The Complete Collection\\" sounds like a terrible generic sitcom, but instead this series is one of the most hilarious comedies of the last decade -- a quirky, weird, tongue-in-cheek little show with hilarious dialogue. Think a musical version of \\"The Office.\\"<br /><br />Folk-pop group Flight of the Conchords is Jermaine Clement and Bret McKenzie (played by themselves), who came all the way from New Zealand to New York. They are being managed by the ineffectual New Zealand Consulate official Murray (Rhys Darby), and they have exactly one fan/stalker, Mel (Kristen Schaal). They don't have many gigs, and even fewer successful ones.<br /><br />As they chase elusive fame'n'fortune, the guys have to deal with girlfriend woes (dating the same girl, a \\"Yoko\\", a girl who just wants to use Bret for sex), financial difficulties (Bret bought a cup!), jobs, muggings, anti-Kiwi racism, a problematic rock'n'roll tour, two new fans with impure intentions, a semi-professional actor/compulsive liar who makes Murray think they've got a multimillion-dollar deal, the Crazy Doggz, Australians, epileptic terriers, the Prime Minister of New Zealand, hair gel, and a stage musical based on their misadventures.<br /><br />If I had to come up with a description for \\"Flight of the Conchords,\\" it would be that they're the folky New Zealand love child of Spinal Tap and \\"The Office.\\" No laugh track, rambling dialogue, and the main characters tend to spontaneously break into song-and-dance at pivotal parts of the plot. And it's brilliant.<br /><br />The writing is brimming over with effortless weirdness, as the guys encounter everyday problems (threesomes, girlfriend woes, weird dreams) which soon turn into hilariously surreal situations (the disturbing children's show, \\"Albi the Racist Dragon\\"). The dialogue is amazing (\\"When I first met you you tried to have me deported from New Zealand because you thought I was an Australian\\"), and full of rambling conversations that just get stranger with every line (\\"Have you ever had a threesome?\\" \\"Nearly.\\" \\"What do you mean, nearly?\\" \\"I've had a twosome\\").<br /><br />The songs are gutsplitting as well, since they're all about homicidal robots, mermaids, toothpaste, hip-hop spoofs, hermaphrodites (\\"Oh you sexy hermaphrodite lady-man-ladies\\"), rappers, cannibalism, and the hiphop-potamus. Not to mention \\"Frodo, Don't Wear the Ring\\" and its accompanying music video, which are a nod to McKenzie's role as the elf Figwit.<br /><br />But none of this would be even half as funny if it weren't for the actors -- Clement's self-named chatacter is stoic and kind of weird (he writes a song about putting a wig on Bret), while McKenzie's is more childlike, naive and likes to sit in a cardboard box. Darby rounds out the cast as their harried, rather pathetic manager (who isn't even supposed to be managing a band), and Schaal is also quite funny as a woman who has a creepy sexual fixation on the guys.<br /><br />\\"Flight of the Conchords: The Complete Series\\" is one of the rarest kind of comedy out there -- steady, hysterical, and only gets better with repeated viewings.

I'm sure the patents on the technology will be making people a fortune for years to come. The story/plot is full of cliches that have been done in many other movies, just with the added avatar twist. It also lacks a really compelling villain. Just the typical hardline military type. But then Camerons movies are always that way. Simple stories but well done and Avatar was worth adding to my small bluray collection.    I had guessed at what the last scene was going to be even before I hit 'play'.
B00008G7UJ|2.0|As a mild reader of Shakespeare, I have seen filmed adaptations of only Hamlet, Macbeth, and Romeo & Juliet. Even though there are a few flaws attached to these movies, I still found them enjoyable, except for one. Baz Luhrmann's 1996 film adaptation of Romeo & Juliet is one that I can't really adore. The entire film is bloated with an overly stylish look and a modernization that looks to have gone too far. First off, I will say that hearing Shakespearean dialogue in a completely modern setting is very awkward. It really confuses the tone of the film: it's like hearing the dialogue from the Lord of the Rings trilogy in a contemporary sports drama. Old and new doesn't work well here. The lack of accents are even worse. Most of these actors sound odd when reciting the text, mainly because they don't have the perfect voices for it. I may be a bit picky, but hearing Shakespeare from modern characters sounds strange. The script could have at least had some contemporary phrases added in. The biggest problem I have with this movie, however, is the excessive style. The Capulet scene especially is overstuffed with colorful costumes and sets, and some dizzying camerawork. The melodrama in the quieter scenes are so overdone that they're actually silly. The heartbreaking ending is slightly over-the-top, but at least it's done quite well. Nonetheless, a majority of this film is a spectacle of style-over-substance, and I don't think Shakespeare would be pleased with it if ever he were alive to see it.<br /><br />Maybe I'm just not a fan of Luhrmann. I've seen his other film, Moulin Rouge!, and I dislike it for some of the same reasons I dislike Romeo + Juliet. I do like the music and the supporting cast, but I don't care about everything else in the movie.<br /><br />Grade: D

B003CIG7AE|4.0|After Band of Horses' first album, Everything All the Time, was released in 2006, their elaborate song construction mixed with abnormally brilliant production for a new indie rock band was enough to quickly earn them critical acclaim. After touring with Iron & Wine and expanding their fan base exponentially, there was some skepticism as to whether the band could repeat the greatness of tracks like \\"The Funeral\\" with their sophomore release.<br /><br />That skepticism was magnified after co-founders Mat Brooke and Ben Bridwell parted ways and Brooke left the band's lineup to pursue other projects.<br /><br />The very next year, Band of Horses released Cease to Begin which shattered anyone's doubts by the time the opening track \\"Is There a Ghost\\" had finished playing.<br /><br />Bridwell, with bandmates Rob Hampton on bass, Creigton Barrett on drums and Ryan Monroe on keys, had evolved and created a much more colorful and dreamy record often aided by plenty of reverb. Producer Phil Ek, who also produced Everything All the Time, returned as well and seems to have evolved with Band of Horses. He has since worked with The Shins and Fleet Foxes that are both much more similar to Band of Horses' second record than their first.<br /><br />Now, three years later, Band of Horses has returned with Infinite Arms, released by major label Columbia Records, and a tour supporting Pearl Jam this summer. With the opening track, \\"Factory,\\" it is easy to believe Band of Horses has picked up right where Cease to Begin left off. Phil Ek is in control of the faders once again, Rob Hampton may have left, but with Bill Reynolds replacing him and Tyler Ramsey added to the mix, there is plenty of talent for lush instrumentation. The only problem is that after \\"Factory\\" and the following track, \\"Compliments,\\" Band of Horses is clearly making an intentional jump into mainstream.<br /><br />Tracks like \\"Dilly\\" and \\"Northwest Apartment\\" take over the second half of the album with upbeat, radio-friendly tracks, making it confusing what Band of Horses' focus was on with Infinite Arms given their elaborate and artistic presentations of the past. By most bands' standards, Infinite Arms is a great record with a lot of memorable tunes, but after they set their own bar so high previously, it falls short of expectations this time.<br /><br />There is enough material on Infinite Arms to justify a purchase for most longtime fans and with Columbia Records taking the lead, it will be an easier album to find than either of their previous releases. I highly recommend that anyone introduced to Band of Horses with this album take the time to hear their past efforts as well, but however you hear them first, Band of Horses is absolutely a band worth knowing.<br /><br />Similar Artists: The Shins, Modest Mouse<br /><br />Track Suggestion: \\"Factory\\"Band of Horses' focus was on with Infinite Arms given their elaborate and artistic presentations of the past.

B002ZRPQ5K|4.0|Keane's newest offering, NIGHT TRAIN, breaks new ground for the band and is bound to ruffle quite a few fan feathers.  With the exception of a couple tracks, gone is the introspective and intimate Keane so many fell in love with when they released [[ASIN:B000268QB2 Hopes and Fears]].  NIGHT TRAIN is experimental and electronic.  They \\"feat.\\" a couple of rappers (with varying quality).  In short, this kind of musical muscle flexing is perfect for an EP.<br /><br />If fans of Keane's early work didn't have [[ASIN:B000268QB2 Hopes and Fears]] or [[ASIN:B000FBHT1C Under the Iron Sea]] to compare, NIGHT TRAIN would probably get a completely different reception.  In fact, this EP would probably appeal to a very different fan base, but that doesn't make it any less valid as a brief collection.  Just like Coldplay, who started with a relatively quiet, thoughtful album in [[ASIN:B0000508U6 Parachutes]], then steadily broadened their horizons and arrangements to create epic tunes like \\"Viva la Vida\\" and \\"Lost\\", Keane is looking to expand its musical boarders, albeit in somewhat more frivolous fashion.<br /><br />The opening track, \\"House Lights\\" will be considered a throw-away by many.  It's a brief and spacey instrumental that lead singer Tom Chaplin explains in the CD's video bonus content is the actual music they take the stage to on tour.  That'll probably only be interesting to those who've SEEN Keane on tour.  The mood is continued in the opening keyboard  blast of upbeat electronica in \\"Back In Time\\", which turns out to be surprisingly listenable, saved by Tom's impassioned vocals.<br /><br /> \\"Stop For A Minute\\" is going to turn heads, either toward or away from the band.  It's a tune that's nearly guaranteed to snare a spot in your head and not let go quickly.  Yes, Somali-Canadian vocalist/rapper K'Naan both sings and raps.  His singin' ain't bad.  I could have done without the rapping, which seemed off kilter and off base as far as the song's theme is concerned.  I don't find the rap as nauseating as some may, but the song certainly would have done fine without it.  A hit and a miss, both in the same track.<br /><br />The next two tracks, \\"Clear Skies\\" and \\"Ishin Denshin\\", are pretty much pointless and forgettable, if not downright annoying.  Per Tom's interview, \\"Ishin Denshin\\" is a cover of a song by a Japanese band, Yellow Magic Orchestra, which Tim saw while on tour, which explains a lot.  A good portion of it is sung in Japanese, and the arrangement sounds like a Saturday morning anime cartoon theme song.  Not my cup o' tea.  The chorus is, in my opinion, the worst thing Keane has ever presented to the public.  It's nothing short of a ridiculous, repetitive loop with lazy BGVs and tingy electronic backing.  Flat out awful.  It may play great across the Pacific in some demented toy store.<br /><br />Mercifully, the band makes an abrupt U-turn and gets back on track with the next three offerings.  \\"Your Love\\", while having a more electronic arrangement than most Keane tunes (with a galloping bass line straight out of the 80s), has a fantastic melody line with some of the best, most lush background vocals I've ever heard on a Keane song.  Lead songwriter and keyboardist Tim Rice-Oxley's lead vocal is innovative and passionate and the band plays with its signature style of everyone melding sound together making a multilayered sonic treat with lovely, melancholy lyrics more typical of Keane's early work.<br /><br />The opening horn arrangement on \\"Looking Back\\" is an obvious homage to the [[ASIN:B000ICM5O4 Rocky]] movies' \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" theme with a funky drum track and though it's instantly recognizable, it doesn't rule the song.  It's such a contrast that it's like being splashed in the face with cold water, but given a chance, one can warm up to this track quickly.  Aside from the awful \\"Ishin Denshin\\", it's the most innovative track on the EP, except this time, the innovations work.  K'Naan returns for another round.  Don't hit the skip button just yet:  His down-beat lyrics match the overarching theme of the song, actually adding to the track.  If one thinks about the theme of the song, the Rocky themed horns bring about a rather delicious musical irony:  \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" is a song of triumph, and \\"Looking Back\\" encourages the listener not to rest on the laurels of the glory days of old.  A clever thematic mash-up by Keane.<br /><br />And finally, the band ends on a high note with the most Keane-y song on the EP, \\"My Shadow\\".  This track could have easily found its way onto any of Keane's previous three albums and been sewn in seamlessly.  The most organic and profound track in the EP is sure to be a fan favorite.<br /><br />So NIGHT TRAIN is different, with some hits and some misses.  I find it an interesting experiment by a band that from it's earliest days has refused to be put into anyone's cubby-hole.  While I don't LOVE the EP, I like it enough that I anticipate boarding the NIGHT TRAIN frequently in the future.<br /><br />Overall Grade:  \\"B\\"<br /><br />Songs that'll get stuck in your head:  \\"Stop For A Minute\\", \\"My Shadow\\"<br /><br />If you have to download just one track:  \\"My Shadow\\"eat lyrics match the overarching theme of the song, actually adding to the track.

B001VNB54A|5.0|I loved the Pacific. I found the action scenes remarkably believable and startling in their realism. Several of these scenes take place at night, which must have been very difficult to film. And yet what touched me the most was the incredible acting done by an ensemble cast of little known actors. The raw emotions our soldiers went through during and after the war were allowed to be showcased. The 10-Part Series had different directors for many of the Episodes. During Episode 3, which takes place in Melbourne, Australia, we are finally allowed to get close to several of the men. That Episode was like a movie within a movie. The direction was first rate, and the acting memorable. I found myself so involved with each episode, that the time flew by. And after just seeing the last installment, I was left hungry for more!     One thing that should be mentioned is that the three main characters of the mini series DID actually exist (in fact, several of the main characters were based on real soldiers). Two of them wrote excellent books on their experiences fighting in the war (available through Amazon). The third soldier won the Medal of Honor during fighting at Guadalcanal. He was ordered back to the States to help sell war bonds. Gradually, he felt so restless and guilty, he demanded to re-enlist, and be allowed to fight. He ended up fighting at Iwo Jima, and I'll leave it at that.     War is hell no matter where it is fought. But out in the far reaches of the Pacific during World War II, our soldiers went through something that they could not begin to describe adequately. And when they returned victorious from the Pacific, it was anticlimactic for most of the country.      My father was in the Army Air Force during the war, and was based in the Pacific. After the war, he stayed on in occupied Japan. He shared a lifetime of stories with me before he passed away 20 years ago. I wish he could have lived long enough to see this mini series. I would have to say that this project comes as close to perfect as I've ever seen. I can't recommend it highly enough.

I have an older Pioneer with Dolby Digital 5.1, and there was no sound unless I selected French or Spanish.  This means that many people can't enjoy this great western.

B003AO1SVS|5.0|I can't understand some of these negative reviews.  I've been a Black Keys fan since Rubber Factory, and I really believe this is one of their best albums.  The only weak album of theirs to me was Magic Potion, but that was because many of the songs on the album sounded the same.  This album, for me personally, is nearly flawless.  Next Girl has one of the catchiest lines I've heard in years with \\"My Next Girl, She'll be nothing like my ex-girl\\",  Howlin' For You makes you want to turn the speakers up way too loud, and Sinister Kid, which has  already firmly established itself as one of my absolute favorite songs from any band, is one of the grooviest, coolest, funkiest songs I've ever heard, from the opening grunt to the ending guitar solos, it represents what The Black Keys are all about now.      If some of these people with negative reviews of the album had listened to or read any of the interviews leading to the album's release, they'd realize the whole point of this album was groove and soul.  Mission accomplished.  Big Time!  As far as them selling out, I think they're trying to break more into the mainstream, and I have no problem with that as long as they keep producing records like this.
1400052173|4.0|I flew through this book, which, with my schedule, isn't easy.  It's the kind of reading you just have to make time for.    I disagree with the previous reviewer who stated that the author should have kept her process out of the story.  This isn't reporting, it's literary fiction, where the author's voice is not only welcomed, but part of the convention.  I think it's more honest for Skloot to have shown her own background and mistakes, so that this becomes part of the larger picture.  Isn't a major element of the Lacks family's history that no one has cared to include them, while using Henrietta and the family to advance their own careers and knowledge?  They were left completely in the dark about the science and why it was so important.  Reporters used them to get a story, but never helped them understand.      Of course, it's not that simple.  The family members suffer from systemic racism, a lack of formal education, and their own shortcomings.  And many researchers behaved admirably toward them (the young scientist at the end of the book was especially touching).  Personally, I love that Skloot includes the whole, messy story, not sugar-coating anything.  The science is fascinating, the human interest angle thorny but also moving.

B001VNB54A|4.0|The Pacific deserves Kudos for what it did right with the 10 part miniseries that just finished airing on HBO.   It started so strong with the fights at Guadancanal in episode 1 and 2. It focuses on 3 real life, well documented individuals, all completely different from each other. The realism was as incredible as HBOs other work in Band of Brothers. Though it dragged a bit in episode 3 and 4, the last few episodes were a triumph. The story of Eugene Sledge slowly losing his humanity and then trying to regain it that was incredibly poignant.  The last episode finished on a very high note and made me glad I stuck with the series .     The problems I had with \\"The Pacific\\" were few but loom rather large in some viewers minds (as in tuning out this amazing series). The swearing was pretty thick at times. I know that this is how it was at times but it kinda shocks grandma and grandpa and adds nothing to the story. The episode in Melbourne, Australia had tons of sex and nudity. Distracting to say the least, and very embarrassing. I know its weird that in this country, its OK to let my 13-14 year old see graphic war violence, but its NOT ok to let them see fairly graphic sex scenes. Why not let the viewer know what occurs discretely. Sex is not bad. The problem is that shows like BAND OF BROTHERS and THE PACIFIC are educational to the younger generation. You shouldnt have to be 17 or older to watch them. Just tone it down some.  By the way, im NOT a prude. Just  keep the tone of each episode consistent. Any family that missed the opening rating and warnings got a shock (raises hand--my face is still red--had 2 young nephews sitting there with me) Im sure im not the only one that happened to..    All in all, this is an amazing series and I feel sorry for anyone that decided to pass on those last few episodes. You missed the best parts. That kid from Jurassic Park, Joseph Mazzelo,  did a wonderful job as Eugene Sledge. His part ended up being even more powerful than Lt Winters in BoB since Eugene was more of an everyman and easily related to. The final episode was shocking in its emotional power and really gave me a sense of what the soldiers were feeling upon their return to civilian life. If you left it mid-episodes by all means jump back in. Its well worth the ride. I cant wait for the Blu Ray and DVD to be released. \\"The Pacific\\"  still plays daily on HBO so its not too late to watch it.
B001E2JNA6|5.0|I have seen every version of the Jane Austen classic ever made, including the old black and white version. In my opinion, the A & E miniseries is the best out there. None of the others even compare to the attention to detail and development of the characters. Now that it is out in Blue Ray, I had to have it. This movie spans generations for appeal. It started out with me, then passed on to my children and now is being enjoyed by my grandchildren. There are not many stories that will bring the whole family together for that many hours. Many of the actors will be recognized from other British and American movies, but once you see them in this performance, you will forever associate them to this classic portrayal. I recommend this miniseries to anyone who is looking for great family entertainment with no fear of offensive material. Hard to find in this day and age.
B00368PSN2|5.0|This is one of those movies you may have never heard of but is really good. Like the cover suggest it is a Beowulf meets Predator type of movie. Unlike what other reviewers say the acting is pretty good and nothing like some of acting seen on the SyFy channel, I'm not sure why anyone would suggest that. The Blu Ray quality is quiet good it appears to be 2:35:1 and not 1:85:1 the sound is fantastic and picture quality is very sharp colors are vibrant although often it seems their is to much contrast. Pick this one up for your collection most will enjoy it and what a heck of a price to boot.
B003LFLOOW|5.0|I can see this movie easily turning into the Star Wars of the 21st century. I'm eagerly awaiting part two; the Na'vi are fascinating.
B003L5LEYW|5.0|Nas' distinct gift for rhyme combined with the reggae melodic verses of Jr Gong create an instant classic album.    I'm not a big reggae fan, but the album is quickly converting me. The reggae doesn't make you feel like you just took a wrong turn into a koffee shop looking for a cup of joe, instead just the perfect mix to compliment Nas's lyrics and Jr Gong's vocals.    Highly recommended.    5*/A+

B0035V35PI|4.0|There is plenty to like about this movie, the action sequences are very well acted and presented. This is achieved with the camera moving in and out during the fighting scenes (real and slow time), to capture and highlight some of the impressive moves or weapon motions.  The story focuses on one individual that has broken away from, and being hunted by a secret modern day Ninja house, that hires out it's assassin's to the highest bidder.  Due to the Kill Bill blood spillage, this is not a movie for youngsters.

The visuals are appealing to my eye, the message is wholesome with the classic fight between greed and innocence. Pure.  though my young children aren't old enough to watch yet, it's nice to see how far we've come since the days of King Kong and ET.  Sweet \\"monsters\\" that overcome prejudice.  When my children get older they will be more than welcomed to watch this :) (they are under 5)
B0012GMW0C|5.0|I would describe this as a heavily progressive space-rock influenced sound.  I'm usually not too much of a fan of instrumentals, but Kohoutek is quite a masterpiece, perfect for a virtual reality setting or when you actually travel into outer space.  I can see why they called it Journey, because it can refer to a journey through space, through exotic places never seen, or simply through the mind.  And of course, they still have melodic pop-rock tunes that would follow in later years, like In The Morning Day, To Play Some Music, and Mystery Mountain, but at least not such cheesy cock-rock, which is the simplest way to describe their 80s hits.  If only they were patient enough to give it a little more time, they would have developed a cult-following and lived large, like many other classic rock bands of their time such as Floyd, Genesis, and Yes.  It's such a shame they turned to the dark side later on.

B00005K3O4|4.0|My best friend showed me this movie last night, and I thought it was crazy funny! It reminds me of the classic b-movies from the 1950's. Cotton Candy guns, evil shadow puppets, screaming popcorn, killer pies, balloon hunting dogs and much more await you. An army of sadistic aliens, who resemble clowns land their circus tent in a small American town. Mike and Debbie; a young couple try to warn everyone but nobody believes them. The killer klowns are funny and creepy at the same time. If you love clowns, horror and comedy, you'll love KILLER KLOWNS FROM OUTER SPACE!!!
B002VPE1B6|5.0|This was the best looking movie I've ever seen on my TV and I have watched a lot of Blu-rays and HD programming. If you want to show off a new HDTV, you should play this movie.
B002ZG98VE|2.0|The only other Robin Hood movie I've ever seen was the parody directed by Mel Brooks. I couldn't compare it to the previous films, but I understand this is a retelling of how Robin came to be who he was. It feels like an epic film, but it was very boring and drags on a few scenes. There are some intense battle sequences, and some humor. Crowe stars as Robin Longstride, a highly skilled archer who helps fight in battles, along with his 'merry men' Sir Godfrey sends his army to attack the people of Nottingham. At first, Lady Marion doesn't trust Robin, but she soon warms up to him. If you are a hardcore English folklore fan, then you'll probably love ROBIN HOOD!!!

B0035G5IOE|5.0|I am a huge fan of all types of animation. It's wonderful that stop motion is getting some new life with the likes of Nightmare Before Christmas, Coraline, Corpse Bride and now this gem Fantastic Mr. Fox. I was not familiar with the Dahl book or story so I was going into this one blind. I fell in love with the characters, story, sets, voices and animation immediately. The majority of the movie's humor and dialogue (there's a good deal of desert dry chatter in this film) will fly right over the heads of most children and even some adults to be certain. The humor is dry, full of wit and adult driven. I loved it!    Video quality on this Blu Ray is strong, nearly perfect. Autumn colors are abundant and the texture of the character's wardrobe and fur is nothing short of amazing. These details really bring this film to life. The audio quality is good; the center channel gets the biggest work out by far on this DTS HD MA lossless track. I was a tad disappointed that the surround speakers and sub-woofer did not get more activity. This audio track was a bit subdued for such a lively movie. Make no mistake though, the dialogue is handled extremely well and the track sounds very solid. Just just don't expect a wiz bang audio excursion track like Up, Wall-E or Coraline.     The vocal casting and acting in this animated feature are superb; I don't think I have ever heard better in any animated film. You can sell this one to the kids but the adults are the ones that will truly reap the reward when this disc starts up. This is a must own title for all animation and home video enthusiasts. Don't waste another minute Cussing around, pick this up immediately!

B00275EGX8|1.0|The producers of this movie decided to sue everyone who downloaded it from p2p networks. That's thens of thousands of people, most of them probably big fans of this very film. That is not a good idea and for that I give the movie a lowest possible score.
B00275EGWY|3.0|Contains many scenes filmed with a jumpy hand held camera, which generates much vertigo, and there are intermittent periods of inaction which necessitate the use of one's fast forward button.  Again, there are multiple night-time and dimly lit scenes which are extremely difficult to decipher on a 27\\" TV screen.  Yes, there is one interesting battle scene, and many instances of suspense centering around, \\"Will the guy get blown up or not?\\"  Other than that, I honestly don't see much here to recommend.
B000B5UL7G|5.0|I am so glad i discovered Robbie Williams cause this has to be one of the best albums i've heard in a LONG time    The thing i love the most about this it are the cheeky lines and the intensive reflective metaphors that leave you speechless.     An example of this is can be found on the irresistible \\"The Trouble With Me\\"    \\"The trouble with you  is you're in love with me.  What a strange thing to do  What a strange place to be  ...  You see the trouble with me  Monkey see Monkey Do,  There's no you in tomorrow  A better offer came through\\"    Or on the extremely beautiful \\"King Of Bloke And Bird\\"    \\"What you do speaks so loud  I cannot hear what you say  Except for the occasional word\\"    I have completely fallen in love with Robbie's music. Justin Timeberlake needs to eat his heart out. If he's America's heart of Male Pop artists these days, Then America needs a heart transplant because he's absolutely no competition next to Robbie. I seriously can't wrap it around my head how this immense talent has been eluded fame here in the States. America is pretty close to being the only country in the World to be in complete oblivion of him, I say this because he's reached Michael Jackson Megastar status everywhere else. He's broken numerous chart records worldwide and he has become a prominent staple of Pop Music.    Don't miss out your chance of enjoying his wonderful music. It's Seducingly Ravashing!!

1554512115|5.0|Having a step-daughter, and a wife who came from a terrible first marriage with an unsupportive husband - I have to say this is the perfect book for the two of them.  And as such, she reads it to her almost every night.  The book is great on so many levels... The artwork has the perfect tone, the writing is witty... and over and above all of that it teaches a young girl that she can be her own person.  She is strong enough to battle whatever she needs to.  She can do everything the man can't do.  She can take care of herself... And when the man is a jerk - she can tell him to beat it.  It is ESSENTIAL reading for any young girl.  These are values that need to be instilled in them as young as possible.  And this book is a great place to start.
030745455X|5.0|This is the book written by Stieg Larsson after \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\".  While I really liked the first book, I liked this one even better and can't wait until the third book comes out.  What a shame that he died because he was a good writer.  I like the way he developed the main characters and he built suspense so that it was difficult to put the book down once I started reading. One can learn a bit about Sweden too because he brings in a little bit of history, politics, etc.  I feel this is a book well worth reading.
0671449028|4.0|We all know how hard it is to put little kid's to bed... As much as we want to go to sleep they want to stay up.  But just as hard as it is to put them to bed, it is even tougher to get them to do the things they need to do before going to bed - such as brushing their teeth.  And there is no better book out there in helping a parent 'coax' their child into this...  It has not only become part of the routine of putting my step-daughter to bed, but has become a part of her reading routine.

0694003611|5.0|A companion to the 'Going to Bed Book' - this is another must have if you have, like me, a child who never wants to go to sleep.  I don't think I'm alone there.  While the former is great at prepping kids to do the things they need to do before bed, this is great to read to them (or with them as they try to find items throughout the book) as they drift off to sleep.  I'm sure if you're reading this you have kids - or are looking for a gift for someone with kids - this is a must have!
B0039TD7RC|4.0|Shall we skip the often reviewed 38-year-old EXILE and concentrate on the outtakes?  Enough has been written about this 5-star classic.    Per the recent Rolling Stone interview, 5 out of the 10 songs (including the instrumental \\"Title 5\\") didn't have vocals nor lyrics. Jagger literally had to go in there to rebuild a song from these instrumentals in the past year. These tunes (let me guess) -- \\"Pass the Wine (Sophia Loren)\\"; \\"Plundered My Soul\\"; \\"Following the River\\" and \\"I'm Not Signifying\\" -- reflect, for better or worse, the more recent BIGGER BANG-era Stones and Jagger specifically. To me these comparatively heavily produced tunes are pretty ordinary.  I mean, with 1 exception, I won't be playing them over and over a year from now and I'm guessing neither will you.    What's a revelation however are the fully intact EXILE alternate (& early) takes -- \\"Soul Survivor\\"; \\"Good Time Women\\"; \\"Loving Cup\\" and even the proto-surf-power pop instrumental \\"Title 5.\\"  Keith's lead vocal on \\"Soul Survivor\\" absolutely takes the prize here. It actually sounds more like a guide vocal as he's heard going, \\"Etc. Etc...Etc!\\" on a latter verse and the lyrics don't often make any sense.  But the groove...the feeling is there that's a whole lot different than Jagger's more focused official effort.  I really like the horns come and punch in.  Absent in the original.    I'm not too crazy about the alt take on \\"Loving Cup\\" though -- it's OK but too languid for me. The Glimmer Twins released the right take.  \\"Good Time Women\\" -- which preceded \\"Tumbling Dice\\" -- however is a fascinating and revealing exercise in the roots and evolution of the classic tune.      I have a bootleg of \\"Aladdin Story\\" -- it's all instrumental -- but according to Don Was on NPR the vocal was mostly the original but new words or verses had to be \\"punched in\\" because on the orginal Jagger had just stopped singing in the middle of something. \\"You think your love is so divine/You think you're the savior of mankind,\\" he convincingly growls.      The vocal on \\"I'm Not Signifying\\" sounds like old Mick trying to sound like the young version.  The tune is a fine romping blues spiced up with horns and Mick Taylor's lead. The solid but otherwise unremarkable \\"Dancing In the Light\\" sounds like a vintage vocal.    Am I the only one who thinks the one dud here is the overly produced and sometimes painful to listen to \\"Following the River\\"?  Although the song starts off promisingly, Jagger seems to be singing way out of his vocal range later in parts. At almost 5 minutes long, the song and its gloppy strings just sags under its own weight. Lyrically \\"River\\" sounds like one of Jagger's better solo efforts though, just not really from the EXILE era.    Sure, I'd love to hear \\"Exile On Main Street Blues\\" again -- only released on a paper thin flexi-disc in some magazine -- and outtakes of all the released songs from EXILE, but this is a start.  Actually, besides the Abkco-produced METAMORPHOSIS, this is the first time The Glimmer Twins have decided to release anything from their tape vaults.      If any of you recall a scene in BEING MICK, Jagger is seen visiting the band's tape vault in London and wistfully looking at the numerous tape boxes representng the Stones' post-1969 recorded legacy.  Then just as quickly he turned away, feigning disinterest.  Hopefully that was then and we'll see some more from the safe in the future.  My dream is they release an \\"Anthology\\" series as the Beatles had.
0375805613|5.0|Hands down - my favorite book growing up.  Without a doubt.  And it is now the one book I 'push' on my step-daughter as much as possible.  It is fun and engaging.  I don't have much else to say other than - go buy this book!!!
B001QOGYFO|5.0|I happened to run across Whiteout one day while surfing Amazon movies and it sounded okay.  I'm very glad I ordered it.  I found it exciting and the desolate location adds suspense to the story.  The weather is so severe that just living and surviving there is a chore.  But add dead bodies falling from nowhere and a whiteout storm on the way and you have a really bad day, especially if you lose a glove!  Hang on, literally, and enjoy the excitement.

B00328G4XY|4.0|\\"Electric Ladyland\\" have been a classic for over 40 years, so i'm not going to review the album, but this Deluxe Edition. I'm giving the same review to all these Hendrix \\"New\\" Remasters.<br /><br />The remastered sound is really an improvement if you only listened to the first pressings of it on CD. But, if you already have the '97 remasters, it's just the same thing.<br /><br />I'm givin' it 4 stars because of the dvd. It's so short, that i really wonder why not to put a CD of demos or live recordings from the era? It would be so better.
0812977246|4.0|A detailed, well-written murder mystery set in Russia less than a decade before the fall of the Soviet Union. Murder investigator Arkady Renko is called upon to solve the murder of three faceless victims found in Gorky Park, and along the way he battles people trying to stop the case from being solved, a wife looking for divorce, a bewitching Siberian girl, an American policeman looking for a murderer, and an American salesman somehow involved in the three deaths. Cruz Smith did a good job in describing the Russian people, and he depicts an interesting picture of the Soviet Union that is reminiscent of Orwell's \\"1984\\".     Two small issues I had with the story was that I didn't fully understand the prosecutor's reasonings for the conspiracy that unraveled, and I thought the love relationship between Arkady and Irina was rather shallow. Still the story is enjoyable read.

142313494X|3.0|My son had this book lying around, and so I finally decided to pick it up and read it, after all the hype of the movie and everything.  It was okay, I guess it was a little bit entertaining, but nothing that great.  In my opinion, Percy Jackson is not an endearing character that invokes feelings of care in the reader.  I finished it so I could discuss it with my son, but not because I was actually interested in finding out what was going to happen.      (The reviewer was compensated for posting this review.

B002ZFQD0E|5.0|How else can you explain how this sharp diamond made it out to the masses? The music industry does not let this type of music run wild anymore. The masses might start setting their expectations high.    Ms. Monnae's \\"The ArchAndroid\\" may be one of the few cases where the sophomore release is better than the original debut. Her \\"Metropolis: The Chase Suite\\" was pretty solid. But this one \\"The ArchAndroid\\", I mean I had to write a review after I heard the CD today. \\"Metropolis: The Chase Suite\\" was fairly ambitious, especially for a new artist. But this one, \\"The ArchAndroid\\", my goodness.     Sonically, \\"The ArchAndroid\\" is the best I have heard since Charles Stepney's arrangements for Rotary Connection and Minnie Riperton. The producers put a ridiculous amount of work into adding layers and textures and dimensions and moods and pigments. It is hard to describe, classical, rock, punk, R&B, folk, hip-hop, house music, world beat, etc. No 2 songs sound alike. The music just does not sit still. There are bridges TO bridges. And actual solos and improvisation! Now some may complain that they have heard this before. Well, it is obvious that some songs were influenced by 60s and 70s soul, R&B and rock. There is a huge of infusion of 80s American/UK pop and punk. As for Hip-Hop, you can hear the OutKast/Dungeon Family formula show up as well. Although I think Ms. Monnae is a much better singer, she reminds me of Bjork in the sense that her songs are very inventive and really make you think about where the inspiration came from, for example on Bjork's Telegram.     All that means is that this music did not come from a vacuum. It was born from the many great artists who made our private music collections Love Affairs. Based on previous comments by Ms. Monnae's, specifically the references to Wondaland, I would guess the CD is the product of a large collective of artists, the depth and range is just breathtaking. And Ms. Monnae is a real SINGER with a strong voice! I would besurprised if she used any Autotune.     I am so glad I bought this CD in support of real music. I would put it in the same category as Bjork's \\"Homogenic\\" and Radiohead's \\"In Rainbows\\". Releases that make you think about why we don't get music like that ALL THE TIME.     Grab it while you can. That music executive might wake up again.
B000BFH2S2|5.0|It's not a secret that MB earned Grammy as THE Best Traditional Vocalist in 2010. His orcherstra is excellent, he finds a new way to sing an old familiar song, and his voice is just perfect!  I had 2 of his latest albums before I got this one. The only reason was that I wanted to SEE him sing rather than to just listen. I was excited to receive this 2 CD feature and the DVD was great!
1594488878|4.0|We know that Nick Hornby can write brilliantly about music and the emotional impact it has on us ([[ASIN:1594481784 High Fidelity: A Novel]]) and that he can brilliantly narrate the awkward relationships between a messed up middle age man and a child ([[ASIN:1573229571 About a Boy (Movie Tie-In)]]). Here, both are combined to some extent and the result is less than the sum of its parts, but still an enjoyable, light read that is frequently amusing.    Duncan is obsessed with a former singer-songwriter, Tucker Crowe, who since his seminal album `Juliet', has disappeared from public life. Duncan and his partner Annie live in a northern British coastal town called Gooleness where not much happens - and certainly not much cultural - and their relationship is not exactly exciting. When Duncan receives a copy of an original acoustic recording of `Juliet', called `Juliet, Naked', Annie writes a less enthusiastic review of Tucker's new release on Duncan's fan site for Crowe. Then unexpected things start to happen. Hornby tells the story from the perspective of these three people, all of whom are a bit sad in their own way. He introduces a few secondary characters to add some life to the main characters' mundaneness - namely a Northern Soul dancer named Barnsey and a terrible shrink named Malcolm, neither of which really added much to the story for me.    It's a story about celebrity obsession, on-line relationships and the on-line lives that fans think they know about celebrities and ultimately it's about redemption - that Hornby has proved that he does so well.    He frequently tells us what's going on in his character's minds when they speak and while this is often very funny, it does sometimes feel that it leaves the reader with little work to do. And they all end up sounding quite similar as a result. It's an enjoyable, light, rom-com type book that frequently avoids the obvious. It's not Hornby's greatest work, by some distance, but it is highly readable.
B002ZFQD0E|3.0|Yo, this album is cool & all But Beyonce had one of the best albums of all time!! This is too Funky, Mellow, Weird & Monotonous for me. Its a decent effort but I want music that gives me life & makes me Feel & connect inside my own world, not take me to a completely different galaxy!, this is a realm that I'm not too familiar with. I need something I can confidently blast on the Radio & enjoy. I'm used to more mainstream music so Ill have to grow to love this style more. I really didn't notice a whole lot of Genre hopping, It's more so settle, there's alternative Soul, Classical/Theater/Thematics, Rock, jazzy Hip hop & hints of R&B throughout, very fluent though. Honestly, The Only songs I really like is \\"Deep Cotton\\", \\"Dance Or Die\\", & \\"Cold War\\"; & maybe bits & pieces of a couple other tracks but thats it. Even so, this is much better than that Sade's boring quite storm mess though. Just weird & what are some of these songs even about anyway??. Overall, because I look at everything when writing a review Ill still give this a 6 out of 10.<br /><br />Update: I'm not gonna call this Over Rated but This isn't for everyone. The great reviews(which is why I'm here) can be mis leading, Whether you like this or not truly depends entirely on your overall musical taste.<br /><br />& Please forgive me, I'm just a little pressed because Beyonce never got the praise that she deserved for any of her albums. Just because her music is more Commercial doesn't make it any less great...
B0039TD7RC|2.0|Let's be clear on a few things. First, the Stones' output in the sixties compares quite favorably with the Beatles'.  Next, unlike the Beatles, the Stones continued into the next decade with a superb live set, and two remarkable studio albums, the second of which is arguably their greatest achievement.  What followed has been almost four decades of largely mediocre records, with some notable exceptions (half of Black and Blue, Some Girls). During those four decades, Jagger has come to represent all that is worst in corporate rock greed. The constant reissues of their good albums with no bonus tracks or additional liner notes/packaging is pathetic, if not inexcusable.  Much of their mid-seventies recorded output was filler, and they milked the best material for at least four albums of mixed material (B & B, Some Girls, Emotional Rescue and Tattoo You).  Last year's reissue of Ya Ya's was so overpriced and contained so little new Stones material that anyone who purchased it needs to have his head examined.  Now comes the much anticipated reissue of Exile with the long awaited additional material.  On the day of its release, Mick reveals that they did not release the material which had already been heavily bootlegged (why not, would remixing it have cost too much money, and actually given long suffering fans more than fourty minutes of \\"new\\" music?).  Also, Mick finally admitted that disc two is not really Exile out-takes, but rather some of the basic tracks that were laid down, with additional musical parts and all new vocals/lyrics.  Which makes much of the vocals, and by extension, the whole thing, sound much like Jagger's crappy solo material.  I am quite sure the background gospel singers were not hunkered down in Keith's frozen basement studio in 1972.  In short, the Stones have succeeded in tarnishing the legacy of the one undisputed masterpiece they recorded, so very long ago. As for the remastering of the original, it is not very different to either of the previous two remasters, both of which I already own.  Finally, and predictably, the packaging is shoddy, and there are no new liner notes or interesting photos, the final slap in the face to Stones fans everywhere.
B0034G4OWM|1.0|This was an OK kids film until they started running around with their underwear pulled up as tight as they could get them. There was no reason to add those scenes, they did not even go with the plot. I would rather my children watch something a little healthier then grown men and teenage boys showing how tight they can get their shorts while standing in front of a camera. What kind of a message is that for children? As far as an adult film, there were a few good parts, but the movie did not flow very well and the ending was like they just gave up on how to close the movie and told all the actors to do anything they thought was funny. I would not recommend this movie to anyone.
159562015X|4.0|I received Strengthsfinder 2.0 as part of a leadership training course at my last place of work. I was told that this book would help us cultivate our strengths and in general make us better leaders over our areas of responsibility. After finishing the book, and a year of implementing its strategies in my workplace I can earnestly say that one of those two statements is true.    A side note to this book: You should absolutely purchase this book brand new, or without an unused access code. While although I'm not totally sure on how the online quiz is supposed to work, the answers I got varied greatly from the ones I self diagnosed myself after reading through the book. Though not knowing how the quiz works ultimately leaves me at a place of confusion concerning which \\"results\\" to trust, I figure that if you're going to get the most out of it you have to do it their way.     Now to the good you'll find in SF 2.0. After the online test I got back my results, along with the rest of my course-mates. At first a bit envious of them (some got cool qualities such as Competition, Focus and Maximizer, while I got rather mundane ones such as Adaptability, I mean really aren't we all adaptable?) I started digging into the books \\"ideas for action\\". This (along with the quotes of those who exemplify the ability) are really the meat of the product. While although not all of the ideas here are usable for every given situation, those that you do implement in your life you will see I believe a good return on. Where the book succeed the most at (at least with me) was identifying certain personality traits not just as being non-weaknesses but actually placing those traits on the level of being strengths. As a frequent church-goer, I've always struggled with the fact that I am not as empathetic as I believe I should be. However Rath's ideology approached my lack of empathy as not being something I should waste my time trying to change, but rather focus on staying out of situations that require me to be empathetic, and redirecting myself to other things I am more skilled at.(ex. while although I wouldn't be a good grief counselor, I certainly can help in the church soup kitchen.)     While I did feel growth on a personal level, I felt that my growth as a leader stayed the same throughout the process. Here is where I feel most people will find a disconnect with the book. As a \\"leader\\" very often you have to lead those who don't want to be led or whose goals are contrary to the overall aims of the workplace. While although I can see Rath's ideas for action working in more ideal work environments than mine, sometimes a ditch is a ditch so to speak.     In conclusion I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for greater personal growth at being an employee, or being better at their career in general. I find that Mr. Rath has a view of life that I find refreshing in the world of workplace efficiency books, which is to focus primarily on cultivating strengths, and to stop wasting time shoring up defects. I hope and pray that the heart and message of this book will be accepted not just by laborers in the workforce but in all areas of industry and even education. We could all save a lot of precious time if we stopped trying to figure out \\"what's wrong with us\\" and kept doing \\"what's right\\".
B0015DROBO|5.0|If you liked the book, then I highly recommend checking out the movie (only played in select theaters in the US)
B002GDM2UA|4.0|I love this movie and have never owned it in a digital format.  I have read DVD reviews saying that it was not even as good as a video tape but this Blu-Ray really looks and sounds great (considering the age and quality of the original film). One thing that really stood out in HD was the weakness of the ending special effects though.  You could really see the wires holding Connor in the air and the \\"ghosts\\" looked especially cheesy.  I would call those last comments \\"spoilers\\" but how do you give away the plot to a 25 year old movie?  Still a great film though and it was worth the extra money for the import since it doesn't look like a US version is in the works.
0385504225|3.0|Dan Brown asserts that most master texts, and especially the the Bible are a road map on how man can become \\"god.\\"  He uses John 1:1 - In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.    Brown makes a VERY sophomore mistake in reading ONLY that verse and not putting it into context.  \\"The Word\\" is the name given to Jesus Christ similar to how God calls Himself: \\"I AM.\\"  John is making the case for the divinity of Jesus.  Brown's mistake is that he has only an elementary, second-hand knowledge of the Bible despite attempting to write a book about how he has special insight into the Scriptures that few others possess.  He takes \\"The Word\\" to be the written word which is what some people use to refer to the Bible (The Book).      Thus, his whole premise is ruined.  For me, this destroyed the literary spell you need to be under to enjoy the epic world-view in \\"The Lost Symbol.\\"  I felt like I was being preached at by a typical pseudo-intellectual who thinks he has stumbled upon new Truth.  Dan Brown is the new L. Ron Hubbard.
B0036EH3TS|5.0|I was so glad this finally came out in Blu-Ray!  Playing the animorphic widescreen DVD really took a hit with a 1080p setup.  The height of the movie was only 9\\" on my 50\\" TV!  This looked and sounded amazing and will continue to be one of my favorites to watch.

B001O22ELQ|5.0|I took a long time waiting to watch this specifically because of all the good reviews. It almost never seems to fail that when everyone loves something, it just rarely lives up to the hype. I'm extremely happy to say that Dr. Horrible *is* every bit as good as everyone says it is.<br /><br />The \\"movie\\" is actually made up of several podcasts that were released for the general internet, all of which follow the would be super-villain Dr. Horrible as he attempts to battle his nemesis, win the love of the girl he's crushing on, as well as win a coveted spot in Evil League of Evil. Life never runs easy for anyone, especially superheroes, so Dr. Horrible's going to have a long way to go before he meets any of his goals.<br /><br />I loved this movie. Seriously, I wish I'd given in sooner. Not only is the acting superb, but the music is awesome & Neil Patrick Harris is as cute & hot as ever!  Part of me wishes the movie was longer, but overall I'm happy with it- I think making it longer might have interfered with the storytelling & fun of the movie.<br /><br />I watched this via a video download, so I unfortunately can't vouch for the DVD disc quality. I can definitely say though, that this is worth a purchase in one format or another!
B003AO1SVS|5.0|Don't let the few negative reviews dissuade you.  I think most of this comes from shock at first listen.  While different than there first 3 albums, this album is there finest musically to date.  You can't keep putting out the same album year after year.  I hear the Blakroc and solo influences, as well as Phily soul and southern R&B.  This album shows how diverse their taste in music is.  A few clunkers but most of the material is great.    This is an album you really need to play on a full range system.  There is a lot of lower bass information (Blakroc?).  The vinyl is dead quiet and lets the analog sound of Muscle Shoals shine through.  This is not their patented lo-fi sound production of the past.  Still mixed a little on the loud side (for the MP3 crowd), this album is one for people who like their music recorded well.....I'm guessing magnetic tape.    Unfortunately most older fans will be dissapointed as this is their crossover to mainstream album.  Me......I'll always be a fan.

B001IB63J2|5.0|Great band if you ignore all of the 12 year old fan girls who label them 'emo'. Lmao.  Got into this group in 05 and haven't been disappointed.
B001F0VHEM|4.0|What has amazed me about the music of Pink is how she has just kept getting better as the albums progress. \\"Funhouse\\" is a raging mass of goofy charisma, heartbreaking ballads and Joan Jett attitude. Not bad for someone who started off making giddy, disposable pop. And I think she knows it.<br /><br />Otherwise, how could you explain the snotty, tongue in cheek \\"So What (I'm just a Rock Star)\\" that opens the album? Or the equally cool \\"Bad Influence\\"? Granted, this is also her post-divorce album, so maybe she's just ready to go be a bad girl and vent some steam. Which is also what makes the title song, a kiss-off of funk, such a hoot. Comparing your break-up to a room \\"full of evil clowns\\" borders on brilliant.<br /><br />At the same time, her voice gets stronger on the ballads, like the Stevie Nicks' influenced \\"Crystal Ball.\\" Then there's the show-stopping \\"Glitter In The Air,\\" which could be her strongest to date. Anyone who saw her powerful performance of this song on The Grammys this year may remember it as one of the show's few musical highlights. As someone I pretty much thought would be gone by now, Pink just keeps upping the ante.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  wish the 2nd one was available for my Kindle but I'm not willing to wait to read it. Am borrowing it from a friend today!
1401219268|4.0|I have to say, so much better than the movie. The removed integral -BETTER -story lines than those used on the theatrical version.
B000002J1M|4.0|Foxtrot is the 3rd 70's Genesis album I decided to purchase (Lamb and Trick were the first two) and it ranks third on my list so far (Trick 1st Lamb 2nd). Supper's Ready is undoubtedly a tremendous effort and the centerpiece of the albim. It has some weaker sections in the middle but the 9/8 section, Lover's Leap, and the ending make up for that easily. Watcher of the Skies and Get 'Em Out by Friday are on the next level down. They feature the stellar rhythm section of Collins and Rutherford and the great keyboard work of Tony Banks. Both songs have downsides, Watcher's intro is a little long and its lyrics are spacy and dated and Friday doesn't really have a melody you can get a hold of as it's all over the place, but the musicianship still shines through. Can Utility and the Coastliners and Horizons are solid pieces, more acoustic, I thnk the shorter legnth helps these two out a little. Time Table is my least favorite on the album. I just cant get into it. This album definately helps set the stage for the remarkable Lamb Lies Down on Broadway, but there are still some rough spots and that's to be expected. I would give it 3 1/2 stars if I could, but I'll give it 4 beause of Supper's Ready.
0060557818|5.0|Recommended for:  everyone from teen and up    Highly Recommended!    Not only is this a Neil Gaiman novel, but it involved mythological beings therefore I was eager to read it, but afraid to be disappointed. However, Neil Gaiman surpassed my expectations by not succumbing to his normal style of writing, and immersing into a narrative about the main character without betraying his private personality. He also doesn't waste time explaining who any of the supernatural characters are and it is not to be missed; you either know them or you don't. Neil Gaiman takes us on a road trip through midwest America and humanizes these gods, unraveling a story within stories which captures your interest as you delve more into the book. I don't want to spoil the fun of discovering the characters and the plots, so all I will say is, read it! It is worth it!
B002HML6Y8|5.0|I already had this movie on DVD, so decided to get the Blu-ray version, and I am glad I did. I have always liked this movie, and now can enjoy it even better on Blu-ray.  I highly recommend it.
B003L0V758|5.0|Ok, I'll come out and say it: Anyone giving this album a mediocre or poor review probably doesn't know what the heck he or she is talking about.<br /><br />I rarely say something like that, but at the same time, there is almost never such an eclectic, sophisticated, surprising, genre-bending album ever to be marketed and released as a \\"mainstream\\" album. This is the kind of incredibly brilliant music that almost never finds its way into the mainstream. This woman is light years ahead of any \\"mainstream\\" pop/r&b/soul artist working today. So I have to say it like I did to open this review -- a whole lot of listeners that have never listened to much beyond the top 40 of their particular musical style are probably going to listen to this once or twice and then let it gather dust. It's THAT challenging to listeners who simply don't go for anything beyond radio-friendly music.<br /><br />And no matter the genre, this album's taken a piece of it, turned it on its head, inside out and then spit out something magical, wonderful and brand new.<br /><br />What's the iPad's tagline? Magical and Revolutionary? Well I've got news for Steve Jobs. THIS album is magical and revolutionary.<br /><br />This phenomenon of a singer and songwriter sounds like Prince, Michael Jackson, Shirley Bassey and Stevie Wonder all rolled into one, but was clearly -- obviously -- undoubtedly --  raised on a completely different Planet Of Wonderful. Clearly she's not from Earth.<br /><br />This woman has style and substance -- a voice that in my opinion runs circles around the supposed divas of the past two decades (Mariah, Whitney, Celine, Mary J, etc.). Her voice is like a never-before-seen color of the rainbow.<br /><br />Janelle Monae oozes STYLE, and CLASS. The songwriting, heck I'll call it songBENDING, is -- creatively -- head and shoulders above just about everything that's been released in the past decade. THIS is how I expected music of the new millennium would sound. It's finally arrived.<br /><br />On top of all that, she incorporates Debussy's Clair de Lune as a coda to Say You'll Go. It's not the first time I've heard an artist do something like that, but I don't think I've heard it done so well, so organically, so seamlessly, so beautifully.<br /><br />Whew. Okay, I'm gushing. It's just that I rarely listen to anything so gush-worthy.<br /><br />Buy it, buy it, buy it.ussy's Clair de Lune as a coda to Say You'll Go. It's not the first time I've heard an artist do something like that, but I don't think I've heard it done so well, so organically, so seamlessly, so beautifully.     Whew. Okay, I'm gushing.

B0019N8P2W|5.0|First off, I just wanna say that I, for one, am glad the show was released on DVD at all, given that its been many years with nothing. It was one of my absolute favorites as a teenager and I was SO excited to hear it was FINALLY coming out. Daria does, in fact, rock.<br /><br />That aside...I wanna address some of the \\"issues\\" in this release. The music, 99% of it, has been changed. Yes, if you've recorded it and watched it on video for years and you know EVERY song inside out, you may be disappointed. However, if you never did this and you waited for a proper DVD release, you may not notice too much. There are moments here and there that I notice a particular song has been changed but, for the most part, they did a REALLY great job in replacing it with stuff that sounds very similar to what was there. Fitting the mood of the scenes and all. You can tell that actual thought was put into it and they didn't just lump some generic elevator music in. I think, if they just HAD to replace the music, they did a pretty good job.<br /><br />As far as sound and picture quality...I've noticed shakiness and some obvious cuts, probably from where they put scenes back into cut versions of the episodes. Yes, they are ALL uncut on this release, which is a great thing. Overall, the quality is pretty good. It's decent. Yes, it IS, of course, in full frame as opposed to widescreen...why I've seen people complaining about this is beyond me because I wouldn't have expected anything else. I think some people just like complaining.<br /><br />The packaging, in my opinion, is where the release really falls short. It's a large, plastic, standard DVD case with a plastic insert containing 4 double sided hard plastic \\"pages\\", it's like a book...if you often buy DVDs, you know what I'm talking about. Each DVD has it's own place so they ARE secure and safe from scratches. As you can tell, so far, this is nothing special at all. No box with artwork, not even so much as a cardboard slip of any kind. No episode guide either, which would have been REALLY nice to have. The artwork is just so-so, nothing special and there isn't much of it. They really dropped the ball in this aspect.<br /><br />Content...you basically get everything as far as I can see. Every uncut episode from all 5 seasons including the 2 TV movies \\"Is it Fall Yet?\\" and \\"Is It College Yet?\\". The features are the original pilot episode \\"Sealed with a Kick\\", Mystik Spiral music video \\"Freakin' Friends\\", Daria Day intros, Top Ten Video Countdown hosted by Daria and Jane, Never before seen Mystik Spiral spin-off script and cast & crew interviews. The original theme song IS there as well.<br /><br />Overall, I'm happy with the set the way it is. Yes, all the little things that could have been done would have been pretty nice. The music could have been left in, the packaging could have been A LOT better...but ya know what? It isn't. We have what we have, it's good enough. The show is still intact. The writing is still as great as it was...it's STILL Daria.er, which would have been REALLY nice to have. The artwork is just so-so, nothing special and there isn't much of it.

B003KVNV4S|5.0|I am utterly convinced that over time this will be considered the National's masterpiece.  It's so dense with ideas that it might be off-putting to listeners hoping for another Alligator or Boxer.  But to my ears High Violet is the album from a band who got the time to grow organically and take 10 years and 5 albums to put it all together.  Thank God for that.
1576754227|3.0|Twenty-one principles that the author says he discovered.  No real strategy.  Even the conclusion, To Put It All Together, just repeats the 21 ideas seperatly.
B001IB63KQ|4.0|Paramore is not usually the type of music I listen to as I'm more drawn towards the quieter, more inward albums. But Hayley Williams' voice is something special and has drawn me in from day 1.    Now to this album, overall it is a really good, high energy, genuine(and by that I mean they don't try to cover up the vocal parts that's less than ideal, Hayley is human after all) live record that covers most of the good songs from the first 2 albums as well as having a pretty good snippet of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah to lead into their own song of the same name. My one comeplain was the mixing, with as much sing along as the band try to get the crowd in, the crowd sure is mixed in to low and you end up listening to muted crowd for at least 5-10 seconds every other song.    Besides that, this is great, this band's got chops, probably still not on the level of Springsteen or Radiohead as far as live gigs but for an up and coming band this is a good sign of things to come(hopefully)
B0007TKNII|1.0|I've LOVED the musical Phantom of the Opera and everything Andrew Lloyd Webber for almost 20 years (I hate my husband for having seen the musical with the ORIGINAL cast no less and didn't appreciate it as he was only 10!). I watched the musical in 1994 in London(a nice experience). I'm still listening to the same old CD and falling in love with Michael Crawford each time. My babies' lullabies are from this musical. I'm disappointed in the 2004 movie as a passionate fan of the Phantom (both novel and musical). I didn't watch it when when it first came out (I remember the bad reviews and my disappointment at the main cast), bought the DVD in 2005 out of curiosity (wasn't wooed then). I tried to show it today to my little girl to tempt her into going to Broadway with me but I just cringed when we fast forwarded to \\"think of me\\" and \\"phantom of the opera\\". The performances lack in emotions. Emmy Rossum looks so plastic, she just bugs me throughout (my personal opinion: doesn't deliver as a lead performer or actress despite being a good singer). I didn't care much for Gerard Butler or his voice. Lately, I couldn't help thinking, Amanda Seyfried should have been the Christine in the movie (I only know her from Mamma Mia). Maybe that movie was made too late (no Sarah Brightman or Michael Crawford), maybe it should have been made by Coppola (because of \\"Dracula\\") or any more inspired director, maybe this movie just didn't meet my vision and memories of the original musical or Phantom full stop. The magic or passion just weren't there for me. Nice supporting cast and cinematography though. I much prefer the TV miniseries from 1990 with Burt Lancaster.
B00004YA66|5.0|It is a feel good movie. As a licensed amateur radio operator I saw a  few flaws, but enjoyed the movie. I missed parts of it when it was on television,  so I bought my own copy.
B003G8WI7G|5.0|I have been looking for a new album to march to while mowing yard.  If I could play the t-bone and mow at the same time life would be almost perfect.  The pace of this album will raise the blood pressure of anyone.  I saw Trombone Shorty on the Tavis Smiley show May 18, 2010 and immediately went to check out the album.  Good stuff! (except for that Fallin' song) ack    Backatown is cracking into the potential of trombone in modern music, but I still wish the last track \\"Horn Jam\\" was at least 15 minutes long.
B003CIG7AE|4.0|I've been listening to Band of Horses' third album \\"Infinite Arms\\" for over a week now.  Initially I only heard three tracks on their Myspace page:  \\"Compliments\\", \\"Laredo\\" and \\"Factory\\".  At first I was noticeably disappointed with the tracks.  Of course I don't like anything the first time I listen it.  Still the tracks definitely sounded more produced than their previous works, most noticeably on \\"Factory\\".  I found myself skipping that track and opting for the get up and go of \\"Compliments\\" and \\"Laredo\\".  Well like all music that I grow to like, all the tracks definitely grew on me.      There was another track I had also heard though and that was \\"Older\\", though I had only heard it in more of a demo form and not in it's album guise.  The track has been on Ryan Monroe's, the keyboardist in the band, Myspace page for at least a good year.  I knew I liked that demo version of the track and so I expected something similar on the album.      So as I said, the band was streaming the album on their website before the album's release.  That was a great opporunity to hear how the rest of the album played out.  Again, I found myself a bit disappointed.  There were other songs that I liked, but there was a problem.  It was as if I would pay less attention about halfway through.  After a few more listens I figured out why that was.  The middle of the album definitely slows down a bit in tempo.  Couple that with it being occupied by in my opinion two of the lesser tracks on the album in the title track \\"Infinite Arms\\" and \\"Dilly\\".  So probably my biggest criticism of the album isn't necessarily the music itself but rather the way it's laid out.  I don't think the album should have kicked off with \\"Factory\\" and it does get a bit \\"lost\\" if you will in the middle.  Still after you get used to it sounds more natural and makes more sense.    Now there is perhaps another reason why the album does sound a bit of a mish-mash of tracks.  With this album you get the influence of theother players more than you did with the previous works.  Well there were other influences in their previous albums, but many of the players have since left the band (especially after the first album).  While there were some talented players in Mat Brooke and Sera Cahoone, much of it was still Bridwell's from what I can tell.  With this album though get more influences from the other players.  Personally I find that to be a good thing considering the tracks that are delivered as a result:  \\"Evening Kitchen\\" and \\"Older\\".  In fact I think that Tyler Ramsey is a good guitar player and songwriter.  However it does seem to lend to a couple of different sounds coming from the album.  So take a look at the liner notes to have a bit more understanding of where the songs came from.  Indeed do so before labelling some tracks, as some reviews on Amazon on here are doing, as sounding influenced by certain bands or other musicians that they were probably never influenced by.        As for the production of the album, or rather overproduction as some might say, I find that it's really not that overproduced.  \\"Factory\\" for me is with that strings sound to it and that definitely sounds like a major label song, but the rest of it doesn't seem so much.  Perhaps the track that best illustrates that for me is \\"Evening Kitchen\\".  Now to understand this you have to first understand who wrote the track.  This is a Tyler Ramsey song and it smacks of his solo album \\"A Long Dream About Swimming Across The Sea.\\"  In fact it wouldn't surprise me if it was a track that simply didn't make the cut for that album.  Either way, it sounds a little... \\"cleaner\\" maybe than the tracks from that album, but it's still a really stripped down song and has his fingerprints all over it.  The title track \\"Infinite Arms\\" though, much like \\"Factory\\", does sound more produced.     The album definitely has a different feel and to an extent sound (particularly from their first album) to it than their previous twoalbums.  For me the second album, \\"Cease To Begin\\", which I also really like had a Carolina feel to it.  This album has more of an \\"out West\\" sort of feel to it.  It's definitely not country and it's definitely not a Carolina sound for me.  I think the album cover encompasses a lot of it really well.  In fact Christopher Wilson's photography again suits the album's really well.  Maybe that's more me attributing the photographs to the songs as opposed to the songs to the photographs.  However having heard the songs first I doubt it.      That leads me to the CD itself.  For starters, great price from Amazon.  The disc came in one of those cardboard cases which I actually prefer to the plastic CD cases.  It sort of tri-folds out.  The outer parts of this tri-fold have the cover, a track listing on the back and just a plain photo on the third part.  All of the photos are that starry sky picture from Christopher Wilson.  The inner part of the tri-fold is this brilliant late afternoon grey sky over some mountains and pine trees evidently taken out West.  Of course the disc just slides out of one side of the packaging.  The real treat though slides out of the other side.  You get twelve photo cars of Christopher Wilson's photography, each one for a particular track.  Then on the back of those slides it says the song track, gives a lyric or twenty and lists who contributed what in terms of vocals and instrumentation.  The final slide has a black and white photo montage of the band members with the back having the liner notes.  All in all a really great collection for a CD and hopefully the band continues to offer this on their coming albums as they have this album and the previous two.       Overall I think in \\"Infinite Arms\\" you get another good Band of Horses album.  Is is their best?  No.  Is is their worst?  No.  I find it on par with their first two albums.  For me that's great because I love their sound and I'd rather \\"nothing ventured, nothing lost\\" if you will rather than \\"something ventured, something lost\\".  Of course some day I might get sick of same old, same old.  In fact I feel as though the general thought these days is that you have to really sound different after a while or Pitchfork for example will slate you.  At the end of the day it doesn't surprise me that the album is getting mixed reviews in the media and even here from fans.  I think the album takes some real listens before you make your judgement though, at least for me that was the case.  For now though I have an album that is teeing up summer very nicely.  I just hope that I don't overplay it before September.
B0039SFKSW|5.0|While the word \\"omega\\" normally means the conclusion of a life cycle, here it almost heralds the alpha stage of Asia, music vital and strong.  I have played this disc through six times and find obvious and subtle \\"Asiatic\\" miracles and mysteries at play.  Wetton's voice is stronger and more emphatic than ever and the playing is never less than masterful. This disc, this music must not be overlooked in this age of karaoke crap and idle idol worship.  Here is the real deal!!!!
B000WQ9UA8|5.0|I like many people grew up listening to Britney. I have and love almost every album. I think blackout is amazing, in fact, I like this album better than Circus. It's full of uptempo club tracks that I love. It never gets old. I've been listening to this album for three years now and its always on repeat. I feel like a lot of people over looked blackout. Here are my favorites    Radar  Why Should I be sad  Freakshow  Perfect Lover  Gimme More    Enjoy!
0446614459|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  David Balducci is my new literary hero!  The writing was compelling and the characters were intriguing.  I found myself envisioning Secret Service Agent Sean King and Michelle Maxwell as they lived out this exciting story.  The basic premise is this:  King guards presidential candidate Clyde Ritter during a rally when his attention is diverted and a killer assassinates Ritter. Though King is able to kill the murderer his career with the Secret Service took a bullet that day too.     Flash forward a few years to find Maxwell protecting presidential candidate John Bruno.  Bruno doesn't stand a chance at being elected but she takes guarding his seriously until he demands she and her entourage give him a moment to pay his respects to the widow of a close friend. When Maxwell gives him a moment of privacy  he vanishes. Oh, the twists and turns are riveting.      Because of the similarities in their career moves, King and Maxwell join forces to find some answers.  The twists and turns are unexpected but the end result is more than satisfying.    I suspect if you are like me, you will enjoy this fast-paced, action-packed tale.  I may read it again!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|I would say this is the best movie I have ever seen in my whole life!!! I saw it in the theater first and it was totally awesome. I couldn't wait for the DVD to come out and I pre-ordered it. We've watched it a bunch of times since then. Absolutely breathtaking sights and effects. I am a nature lover so the whole concept of Eywa was great. Without a doubt, this is my favorite movie of all time.
0307269981|5.0|After reading the first two books in the \\"Salander\\" trilogy, I could not wait for the third one to come out on the US market.<br />However, the translation in English was already available in the UK and I bought it for a good penny on ebay. Maybe I am tired of<br />the predictable cop dramas we are used to here in the US. Also, I grew up in Europa and the background of the Salander books, meaning<br />Sweden with his welfare society, suffering the influx of the poverty in the nearby baltic countries and fighting high taxes and inflation, is well known to me.<br />Of course, the books are all fiction and lack sometimes on logic and probability, but heck, this is not Science, it's entertainment and that is very well done. To bad that the author died prematurely. However, the third Salander book was just enough and he would have to find another \\"Heroine\\" to keep up the good work. If you like Stieg Larson, try Henning Mankell with his Kurt Wallander<br />mysteries and start with the beginning - meaning with one of his latest books \\"the pyramid\\", where Wallanders carriere starts.
0439023483|5.0|Loved this book! the story line is different from anything I have read. Tactical,Katniss has some hard choices to make but they all revert back to helping the ones she loves. good mix of nature, love, drama,action,glamour,hunting, and evil government- a true hearted tale.  I was such a tom girl growing up- but still such a girl,and this book caught my interest immediately from the first pages, I highly suggest reading this book.
B0029LHW68|5.0|This album is off the chart good! I love almost every song. It's definitely my favorite out of all 3 of their albums. (but I liked the 1st 2 also) The sound is much different than their previous works. It is larger than life...epic is the word that keeps coming to mind. The lyrics are amazing. The moving lyrics and the sound of the music & the legions of fans that help out in the background make a very powerful combination. Top it off with Jared's voice (which in my opinion is a force of nature to be reckoned with) & it just doesn't get better! I listen to it over, & over, & over. I just never get tired of it. These guys make d**n good music!
0312539517|3.0|I've never regretted buying a Jeffrey Archer work. When I began reading Lord Archer's \\"Kane and Abel\\" 30 years ago, he had me at the first line (To paraphrase a line from Jerry Maguire \\"He had me at hello\\").  Since that time I've looked forward to each new book.  In each story the characters evolve over the years...and his writing style is such that I stay up way too late...wanting to get to the next chapter, always in a hurry to get to the end, yet hoping it never ends.<br /><br />Paths of Glory is a departure for Archer, in that it is historical fiction.  Nonetheless it's very engaging.  The reason I read it was because of who the author was, not because of an interest in Mallory...plus I have no interest in mountain climbing.  That being said I found it interesting, but Archer has done better.
B003AYPMBU|4.0|Like a lot of people, I suspect that if you are a Judas Priest fan you already have the original CD version of British Steel or the 2001 remaster or both.  So you ask yourself, is it worth getting another copy?  These days we tend to expect a lot out of anniversary editions and deluxe editions, and no doubt looking at the CD track listing you say to yourself WTF?  Then you throw the DVD in the player and discover it was well worth the time and expense.    I have to admit that I was somewhat underwhelmed by their last live DVD Rising In The East.  It lacked the sound and energy I was expecting and absolutely paled in comparison to Unleashed In The East.  Well, they dug deep on this one by showing the commitment and passion they still have for a landmark album, and putting on a classic show for their fans.  This DVD is absolutely dynamite.  The camera work is great.  Unlike too many live DVDs, they didn't edit it down to rapid fire changes. KK & Glenn play their butts off.  From my perspective, KK is featured more on these older songs than he seems to have been on the later CDs.  If you love KK, it's like 1979 all over again!  Ian can be found anchored in his normal spot swinging that bass back and forth without missing a beat.  And the new drummer brings us back to the Les Binks days (which is a good thing).  Rob sounds amazing.  He's like Ian Gillan in that respect.  You keep asking yourself how they can hit those notes after 40 years?  They can and he does.    I liked it so much I ripped the audio track off the DVD and currently have it in high rotation on my iPod.  This is a great tribute to a classic album.  But yeah, gotta ding them 1 star for not giving use something new on the studio album side.
B001ECDVYK|4.0|I love this movie. One minute you're looking at two escaped cons fleeing when halfway through the movie it turns into a Vampire slaying movie! The halfway point of course is defined when Salma Hayek does a table dance that still leaves me looking look Quentin Tarantino does at the end of her dance...and I've watch the movie at least half a dozen times!  It's a strange movie and having George Clooney as a tough guy certainly makes an unexpected change. As my title says, it has a Hitchcock change that makes the movie interesting and it's better not to know anything about the movie before watching it. All I can say is do not give up on it because of the way the movie starts! Watch the whole thing before making comment.   The disc has great sound and excellent picture. Special effects are good but today they would be done better. Well worth the price though.
B003MLBYRM|1.0|I haven't seen a Dr. WHO for some time.<br /><br />The first season 5 episode \\"The 11th Hour\\"; and the second episode \\"The Beast Below\\"; caused me to purchase the entire Season 5 - using the amazon 'pass' system.<br /><br />'11th Hour' is VERY good.  'Beast Below' is a somewhat dark and foreboding episode for most of it... having images of a hell like - apparent fire filled pit - but the episode ends in a surprising upbeat and positive tale.<br /><br />The third 'Victory of the Daleks' is mostly mindless drivel taking place during the beginnings of World War II on Earth.  Has Sir Winston Churchill...  Not great.  But not terrible.<br /><br />The next two season 5 episdes; 'Time of Angels' & 'Flesh and Stone' are TERRIBLE.<br /><br />'Time of Angels' opens up very promising...  Then degenerates into Demonic Angels killing people to feed off them; and because they like to kill.  Computer Graphics of the gaping mouth and teeth attacking...<br /><br />The 'angels' look like stone, and cannot move if your looking at them... but if your not looking at them; and they have some energy from feeding off of someone else, or the ship which has crashed; then the stone morphs into the real thing - a demonic angel seeking only to kill and eat you...<br /><br />This is a 'two parter' which they drag out into the 'Flesh and Stone' episode...  Where we are now fully immersed in the Army of demonic angels who are killing everyone in Dr. Who's party - and looking to conquer the Universe after they kill and eat everyone here...<br /><br />A couple of the main characters do manage to survive; (Mostly Dr. Who and Amy Pond); and the end of the episode starts the advertisement for the coming one... where they advertise - not kidding - the VAMPIRES which are going to be killing, sucking blood, etc. in the next episode of Season 5.<br /><br />Older, previous Dr. WHO did not have vampires and demonic angels running around...  If you like 'Stephen King novels or movies' - you probably won't like this - since it won't have enough suspense and graphic terror.  If you enjoy violence for violence sake; and no real plotline other than showing a dark, spiritual world - then you might like these.<br /><br />Me - I cancelled my season pass.  Wasn't for my wife and I.  This is garbage.<br /><br />BTW: A spiritual world does exist.  And some angels who are 'demonic' and wish only to kill and destroy - do exist.  But I don't need to immerse myself in it.  If you want to know about the spiritual - get Blessed.  Read Revelation for quite some time - over and over and over - till you understand it.  God does speak to those who still wish to hear.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|This is album was a breath of fresh air to me... Everybody that raps today sounds like Lil Wayne (no disrespect to Weezy) but nobody is original anymore... Reggae too, all the riddims are sounding the same to me too!  This album gave me a different sound and to my surprise most of the album was produced by Damien... I didn't he had skills like that!  The apple hasn't fallen that from the tree!    The album has great messages; Nas and Damien compliments each other very well. I love the way they share the mic and feed off each others energy. I thought every track was on point and I didn't find myself wanting to skip any... I hope there's part 2 coming soon in the future...    Definitely pick this album if you're needing something new and fresh... The beats are perfect, a great of blend of reggea mixed w/ hip-hop drum patterns and tempos... The last time I enjoyed an album this much was Kid Cudi's \\"Man on the Moon\\"
0736063684|5.0|this is one of the best books i ever bought. it breaks down which muscles are effected from each weightlifting exercise. it also taught me more exercises for each muscle. this is a must have book for any weightlifter. i recommend this book to any beginner or experienced lifters.
0441013597|5.0|Dune is an all respects a truly great piece of work.     The synopsis of Dune is fairly simple. A family takes over the mining operations on a highly sought after resource (spice) on a distant planet. However, treachery awaits and a young boy and his boy find themselves as outcasts with desert nomad people the Fremen.     It's a good story. However, what makes the book great is the depth of the writing. Herbert, took a chance with his writing style of weaving his personal philosphy into the story and risked alienating the casual reader. But he had the talent to pull it off. And what a pay off. A fantastic novel. And what I like best about it, is that it has great re-readability. Everytime you read it, you get something you didn't before.    By now, I'm read the story 5 times. And I know it inside and out. But every time I finish reading a book, I'll drawn back to it.
0545123267|3.0|This book actually took me a long time to finish.  That's not totally a commentary on the book itself, I just got really busy with work.  I did find the book hard to put down in the beginning.  Some people make comparisons between this story and the Twilight series.  I've only read the first Twilight book and I can see the similarities.<br /><br />Instead of a vampire, Sam is a teenage werewolf (not at all like the cheesy movie).  He's smart and sensitive.  Grace is a very self-sufficient teen with parents who basically ignore her, which allows her to harbor Sam in their house right under their noses.<br /><br />Sam's time as a changing werewolf is coming to an end.  Soon he will not be human at all.  There's a race at the end of the book to save Sam, which sets the sequel up nicely.  I will read that when it comes out.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|A fine film beautifully rendered on 2-D Blu-ray. No need to have a 3-D version, when the image quality is like this. Good story, too. And a good price!

B0039OGGVQ|5.0|This cd just plain kicks ass. All of the singers bring very different styles to each song. Myles Kennedy should be the next singer of Velvet Revlolver, his songs are very cool. Fergie rocks on her vocals. This is a must have disc for any Slash fan.
0307473473|5.0|Sweden, 2005: Facing financial ruin, a spell in prison for libel, and the destruction of \\"Millennium\\" (the crusading financial anti-corruption magazine of which he is part owner), the future looks bleak for disgraced financial journalist, Mikael Blomqvist. But in his darkest hour, Blomqvist is made an almost irresistible offer by retired patriarchal head of the dynastic Vanger corporation, Henrik Vanger: if he devotes all of his powers, and exactly one year of his life, into looking into the mysterious disappearance of Vanger's niece, Harriet, during a family celebration on the Vanger family's island estate some forty years previously, he will be rewarded with both an extremely substantial sum of money as well as information which will allow him to overturn the libel case which has virtually ruined his name as a journalist. Whilst initially reluctant to take up the offer, Blomqvist eventually does so and in the course of his investigation, finds himself drawn into the orbit of the misanthropic, flawed and deeply brilliant Lisbeth Salander, a young corporate security analyst with a pathological disdain for authority, a genius for computer hacking and a dragon tattoo on her shoulder...<br /><br />Every year publishing houses seem to unleash at least one new media-hyped literary sensation upon the unsuspecting public: in the mid-nineties it was the quasi-mystical nonsense expounded in [[ASIN:0446671002 The Celestine Prophecy]], the early noughties gave us the execrable works of Dan Brown (I still find myself chuckling at a friend's description of \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" as \\"[[ASIN:015603297X Foucault's Pendulum]] for Beginners\\") and recent years have seen us inflicted with Stephanie Meyer's genuinely awful Vampiric progeny.<br /><br />2008's phenomenon-du-jour was the first publication in the English language of \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\", the first novel in a trilogy written by Stieg Larsson, a crusading liberal Swedish political journalist and expert on the European Far-Right, who had initially written the books for his own amusement and who was persuaded to get them published by friends and colleagues. Suffice it to say, the book became a runaway bestseller (something that Larsson was sadly never to see due to his untimely death from a heart attack at the age of fifty) and a media sensation.<br /><br />However, it must be said that in direct opposition to most of the books mentioned above, \\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" really is worthy of every accolade that has been heaped upon it.  Larsson's novel is, thematically speaking, an examination of corruption and how the more ruthless, fiscally successful echelons of a modern western society can exploit it's most vulnerable members for the benefit of fiscal, social and sexual gain. As a writer, Larsson is a fascinating mixture: he possesses Ian Fleming's laconic pace and eye for description; Thomas Harris' fondness for dark, psycho-sexual rumination; and Michael Marshall Smith's scathing insight into the heart of deeply nihilistic but extremely likeable characters.<br /><br />Add into the mix a fascinating \\"locked room\\" mystery and an exploration of the secrets and lies that haunt the lives of a Dynastic industrial family worthy of Mervyn Peake's [[ASIN:0749314265 THE CORMENGHAST TRILOGY- TITUS GROAN/ GORMENGHAST / TITUS ALONE]] and you have the recipe for one of the most enjoyable thrillers of recent years.<br /><br />And then of course, there's the girl herself: Lisbeth Salander is, frankly, the heroine that the thriller genre has been crying out for for years; a fascinating, ambiguous, flawed, deeply intelligent woman who is as deeply scary as she is vulnerable and sympathetic. It's a testament to Larsson as a writer that I, as a jaded thriller reader, completely bought into Salander as a character and yet still managed to be completely caught off-guard by her behaviour throughout the novel.<br /><br />\\"The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo\\" and it's two sequels in \\"The Millennium Trilogy\\" have now been hyped beyond all belief throughout our all-pervasive media. For that reason, I was initially only prepared to give the novel four stars in order to keep it in some sense of proportion for the reader; but then, I ruminated, if I'd happened upon it in a bookshop and read it blind, it would be the book that I would then be urging all of my friends to read - which is presumably how the hype got started in the first place; and for that reason, I'm as guilty as everyone else and so it gets a solid five stars from me.<br /><br />...And seeing as an unnecessary American remake of the recent Swedish film adaptation will inevitably be on the cards in a few years time, I hereby lobby for [[ASIN:B000GI3KGC Hard Candy]] star Ellen Page to play Salander (although if we had access to a time machine, a [[ASIN:6305428220 The Faculty]] era Clea DuVall would have been perfect).belief throughout our all-pervasive media.

B0039TD7RC|5.0|I never understood why people call this album a masterpiece? This is the second time I'm buying this album and the package and remastering are excellent. Great second disc of goodies. Now why wasn't the entire later catalogue done like this? I love the Stones, but the Beatles were really more advanced. The reason I say this is because the Beatles were only around for 7 years and in my opinion have done more then the Stones did in forty seven years. They are completely different groups though. I still love the Stones and realize their genuis.
B00000J2SO|5.0|I thought this was one of Rainbow's best albums - the tunes are great and the guitar playing is top notch. Bonnet, as singer, was a bit limited unless you like a gravelly sound (like AC/DC) but still he was a good transition from Dio. It is odd that for some reason Blackmore needed to refresh the band every so often and thus not only do we have a new singer but Roger Glover from Deep Purple is back.  This was their last decent album
B000VLE3GA|5.0|This band doesn't really need a greatest hits. I mean every song on every album is basically awesome. That being said this compilation is missing some great songs. The remastering on this album is good, but I wasn't blown away. The package and overall song selection is nice. Well done lads, but where is FOOL IN THE RAIN? That song was huge.
B00000J2SQ|2.0|This album was the end of the road for me and Rainbow - I really thought they had completely lost it - some nice cheesy tracks such as \\"Stone Cold\\" but really the edge was gone and it was time to pack it in with stuff like \\"Death Alley Driver\\".
B002PDB9O6|5.0|Music by Kitaro is beyond comparison.  I have 12 of his CDs and will buy more in the future.  Very easy listening.
B000002JSH|5.0|Bad Company had some good tunes but I always felt there was a moody feel to their music bordering almost on being depressive - However, this album unlike the first one has more drive and energy and thus the moody element is more subdued. Anyway the album is atmospheric and reminds me of the 70s - how would i feel about it as pure music if it did not have connections for me, as music inevitably does with time and place? That I do not know!
B0013FBS20|5.0|Great movie. It worked perfectly on my play station 3. Before buying the blu ray I knew the movie on DVD and Amazon had a very good price
B00000IMTG|4.0|Compared to Live in Germany, this comes accross as a bit all over the place and lacking professionalism. Even so it is worth having. Whilst it is indeed good to have an album from Rainbow's Dio era, given that we now have a choice with the \\"Live in Germany\\" album, I would urge others to go for that album rather than this one; obviously if you ahve the cash you can get both!
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|This album is lush with great orchestration, great string arrangements and piano. \\"Bobopbye Ya\\" is the song that epitomizes this creative arrangement with lush strings, jazz piano, horns, and a torch song vocal! What amazes me about this CD is how the song are so different, not formulaic; I find myself listening to the CD over and over again with ever greater appreciation. Additionally, the songs are catchy but have a soul that stimulates the imagination, for example, \\"Wonderland\\" has the catchy refrain \\"touch my wires\\", a science fiction love song about android love. I also enjoy the slower \\"57821\\" which has amazing harmonies and is reminiscent of a medieval but modern song. Then there is the rock ballad \\"Make the Bus\\" with great drum arrangements, the soulful \\"Neon Valley Street\\" and \\"Oh, Maker\\", and the punk \\"Come Alive (War of the Roses)\\". \\"Tightrope\\" and \\"Dance or Die\\" are hip hop dance songs that make you move. There is the funky \\"Locked Inside\\" that is so uplifting, reminiscent of Stevie Wonder! Also, the transitions from \\"Sir Greendown\\" to \\"Cold War\\" and \\"Faster to \\"Locked Inside\\" are brilliant. \\"Faster\\" is destined to become a big hit and deservedly so. What a joy this album is, Janelle Monae is a creative genius with a beautiful voice.
B00000IMTE|5.0|Rainbow's first album remained one of their best along with Rainbow rising and Down to Earth. Such classics as \\"Man on the Silver Mountain\\" \\"Catch the Rainbow\\" and \\"Temple of the King\\" were never rivalled - the wonderful mixture of heavy rock and folk elements (as in Temple of the King).  The great thing is that with Dio one never got the usual rubbish Rock lyrics - his lyrics weere of a different order - Lord of the Rings like!
B001OQCV2O|2.0|As far as CGI, this movie is tops.  As far as story line, it is propagandist tripe.
B00000IMTF|5.0|This is Blackmore and Dio at their best producing a kind of heavy rock fantasy album - listen to the lyrics they are quite mad really. But, they make a great change from the usual pulp one is exposed to in rock music. Ok there are only six tracks but for £5 it is worth it and this is energetic heavy rock at its best with virtuoso guitar playing from Ritchie
B000HEVZ6W|5.0|The movie is a timeless classic (retro/futuristic at the time now ages very well) but you've got hundreds of reviews to tell you that already.    This, specifically is about the movie's blu-ray transfer and I have to say it's excellent.  I would go so far as to say that I prefer it to newer high-def titles as you get ridiculously clear picture and detail, but not in a surreal way.  I have *no* idea why that is because they're all supposed to be shot on film, even newer movies.
B00000J2SP|3.0|I loved this as a young lad - I thought it was great pop Rock but now I have mixed feelings about this album - some really good poppy tunes like \\"I surrender\\" and \\"Magic\\" and \\"Can't happen here\\" but I am also conscious looking back that it was the beginning of the end leading as it did to the dreadful \\"straight between the eyes\\". Some fine guitar playing though but I do think Joe Lynn Turner was a mistake.
B00328G4XE|5.0|ok, what do you want to know.  There isn't anyone on earth that can play guitar like this.  This is a classic obviously.  Clapton, who in my opinion, is a student of Hendrix is second among the living.    There are a lot of really good guitarists out there.  But the living and most of the dead one's aren't in Hendrix's league.  There may be some dead one's that were close with different styles.
B002VPE1AW|3.0|I thought this film was visually beautiful and stunning.  The effects were impressive.  But a film should always be about the story and the characters, not just the effects.  Personally I found the story derivative and simplistic (very black/white, good guys vs. bad guys, no grays).  The anti-military (or anti-US) subtext made me extremely uncomfortable (and I'm not a gung-ho type per say).  The cartoon like violence bothered me (hello - people are supposedly dying here - remind me why are we're cheering?).  I've enjoyed the director's other films but this one just didn't do it for me.
B001MEJY8W|1.0|SPOILERS ALERT!<br />I'm one of those horror/slasher/sci-fi movie addicts who you hear screaming the loudest for something fresh and original.  Well, the French-Canadinmade Martys, hit me square in the face and all I can say is that I will never ever watch this exercise in sadism/horror again.<br /><br />Yet,I'm not urging others not to see it since they may be able to figure out the logic behind this gorge-inducing orgy of sadistic torture at its most extreme.  It makes the Hostel movie look like The Blind Side.<br /><br />Pascal Laugier is the writer/director behind this grim creatio. The story follows a badly beaten young girl who has escaped a home prison where she has been beaten, sliced and tortured for months. Fifteen years later, she returns to murder the family that enslaved her.  The girl dies, though, and her girl friend then becomes a prisoner of a cult of your everyday German torturers.  Their reason for trying to torture her to death is  see if she can see what lies ahead in death><br /><br />The beatings and torture of the frail girl are nonstop. A man keeps visiting her to beat him violently and kicked her as hard as he can. She's demoralized in everyway.<br /><br />At the end, there's no justice or relief. The sadists and killers all go their merry way after the girl--who has been skinned alive by the male sadist--finllly dies.<br /><br />To me, Pascal Laughier wanted to make a violent, sadistic movie that would push it over the edge.<br /><br />His key make-up man, Benoit Lestang commmitted suicide shortly after the movie was finished.
B0038P59A0|5.0|Sherlock Holmes.  I haven't read any Holmes books.  I occasionally watch the older series they run on PBS.  I just really don't know much about the original stories, so I can't sit and compare whether or not this is anything like the original Holmes.  But just as a regular person watching this movie, I really liked it!  I thought Law and Downey Jr make a great Watson and Holmes!  We rented it first, but are going to buy it to put in our dvd collection, we liked it that much.  It was funny, it had suspense, excitement, and it was just a good entertaining well done movie.  I loved the music and will be adding that to my music collection as well!<br />I can't really say that there is anything I didn't like about this film.  I just really enjoyed the whole thing.  I love that they left it open for a second movie and am super thrilled to hear that they're making a second!  Can't wait.
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I've always gotten the wubbanub pacifiers but the monkey is by far my favorite.  The weight of the monkey helps keep it in an infants mouth and when they get older they can find them easily in the night.  Super great product and prompt delivery.
B003188AIM|1.0|The Mayans supposedly predicted the end of the world in 2012, having access to neutrino detection. The film's main strength is its special effects that covers up all of the defects in the film; one is so distracted by the whiz, bam, crack of the movie that you don't have a chance to cringe at the two-dimensional, no, scratch that, one-dimensional characterization, holes in the logic, third grade idealism. But even the special effects fail for the simple reason that they are excessive, and in a ridiculous manner. It's as crappy as The Day After Tomorrow and that's saying something.    In order to enjoy this movie thoroughly, have a lobotomy (and absolutely no knowledge at all of even the most elementary science).
B0019N8P2W|5.0|There really isn't much to say since everyone else basically covered it. I am fully happy with it, as it still makes me laugh. I found it so hard to put away because it was so good.    As for the music, its not a big deal depending on how you see it. For me, I am glad they got the series out. I don't really blame MTV or the creators of the show since in 1997 the idea of putting tv shows on dvd was either unheard of or just some concept that people probably thought was silly. But I do blame the music industry and the individual singers that decided to be greedy. Oh well its their loss in the end as they missed out on a chance for people to find songs to like and even buy through iTunes or something.     As for the packaging, its love-hate for me. It isn't the worst but it isn't the best. The thing does fall apart based on the position of how you hold it or if its rough handled. But you can snap the dvd holder thingy back on unless you break that.    But for me at least, there is nothing too horrible to make me give it anything less than 5 stars. It kept me busy for hours and drove my mom insane at the same time lol. So I am happy!!!
B003CIG7AE|4.0|It's a bit weird looking at Band of Horses as a mainstay in the Americana genre nowadays when their acclaimed debut, Everything All The Time, came out a mere four years ago. But that's what they've become, for better or worse - in the eyes of this reviewer, the latter, as I've never really been partial to anything the South Carolina-via-Seattle collective has put out. Perhaps that makes it a little odd, then, that Infinite Arms has resonated the strongest with me of all their efforts. I'm not sure what to blame this on, as Infinite Arms still sounds pretty much like both their previous albums. Frontman and main force Ben Bridwell still sounds like a slightly less expressive Jim James, the band still pumps out mellow, inoffensive rock `n roll with a country bent, and everything vaguely reeks of honeysuckle and crisp Northwestern air. Maybe I'm just getting old, but that's just exactly what I like about it - how everything seems reinforced, like Bridwell has finally mastered pairing his songwriting gifts with the studio to create something that sounds perfectly in place, perfectly uniform, and perfectly together, like everything the band has aspired to previously but never quite reached.<br /><br />It's a sense of familiar comfort more than anything, but when I never really thought of Everything All The Time or Cease To Begin as anything great, it's the subtle craftsmanship of the songs here that end up making Infinite Arms such a success. Opener \\"Factory\\" encapsulates this feeling better than anything else, swelling strings framing one of Bridwell's most stately, heartbreaking melodies yet. Everything is just so epic, like something that would have fit well on the soundtrack to Cold Mountain or The Assassination of Jesse James. Bridwell sounds more confident than he ever has, be it on the rollicking single \\"Compliments,\\" the starstruck haze of the title track, or the fearlessly country \\"For Annabelle.\\" Whether it's Bridwell's newfound fatherhood or just that he's comfortable with where he wants Band of Horses to go (deep, deep into the American countryside), Infinite Arms never struggles to find its identity, never wanders about unsure of where to go. The harmonies are stronger, more layered; the music is more fleshed-out, creating a mellow, intimate atmosphere that is far better suited to driving along a backwoods road than listening in a dreary apartment; everything, indeed, is more sonically at rest, flowing rather than forced. Indeed, Bridwell is the real firebrand here, laying down his most versatile performance yet, but it's a performance that never flies off the rails or lapses into lazy platitudes.<br /><br />The same can't be said for all the songs here, which maintain that same sense of loving attention to detail but occasionally meander about into mid tempo folk sludge. After the awesome throwback to `70s FM rock, \\"Dilly,\\" there's an unfortunate sequence of tunes that tend to try too hard (\\"Older\\") or simply bore (\\"Evening Kitchen\\"). Things pick up before the end with the raucous (by Band of Horses standards) \\"NW Apt.,\\" but the heart of the record lies in the first half, where the songs paint a picture more of feeling than of any particular image. It's a feeling of familiarity, to be sure; Band of Horses is never going to be accused of being wild innovators like My Morning Jacket were with Evil Urges or entrenched, dyed-in-the-wool revivalists like Fleet Foxes. But is it so bad to master one's craft, to whittle away on a song until it represents just what you want, what you've been aiming for your entire career? They'll never be one of the greats, but Band of Horses have proved that they've near mastered the art of making quality, old-fashioned rock `n roll.e with where he wants Band of Horses to go (deep, deep into the American countryside), Infinite Arms never struggles to find its identity, never wanders about unsure of where to go.

B0039TD7RC|5.0|I'll keep this short.  We all know it's a masterpiece, but count me as one of the people who was always frustrated by a murky, horrid mix.  The remastering hasn't changed the vibe one bit!  This is a vast improvement, and moreover, the  extra tracks are a fine addition, particularly \\"Plundered My Soul\\" which absolutely shines.  Get it.

This album pulls sound from numerous corners of the globe - exactly what I expected from Damien Marley's production. I predict this album would do better outside the U.S. I hope they have funding from Universal for a World Tour. Waiting for a second collabo album next year or maybe in two years. Good music will live on even with the excessive downloading.
030745455X|2.0|***SPOILER WARNING ***<br /><br />I could be wrong, but this book has all the tell-tale signs of an author who has written a hot debut and then gets pressured into rushing a second book to market long before it's ready. It virtually screams out for an angry editor in a bad mood, with its almost-700 pages of rambling back stories, an unceasing stream of extraneous and crudely drawn characters, ridiculously implausible and irrelevant situations, and deus ex machinas raining from the sky. This is like a graphic novel without the pictures.<br /><br />A disfigured and irredeemably sadistic madman? A gigantic, soulless henchman who conveniently can't feel pain? A world-famous ex-boxer who shows up for no other purpose than to get in a fight that has absolutely no bearing on the plot? A protagonist who is declared dead and then RISES FROM A SHALLOW GRAVE TO SEEK REVENGE UPON HER PERSECUTORS? (Huh? What? You mean... she wasn't... really dead? Who could have IMAGINED that an author might hesitate to snuff out the titular character of his series?)<br /><br />This plot would be laughed out of any beginner's fiction-writing class. I wish the author was still with us so I could ask why he presumes his readers are this stupid. (Although, reading some of these four- and five-star reviews, he may have been onto something.)<br /><br />Okay, we GET it. Salander is brilliant. Really, REALLY brilliant. Like, so unbelievably brilliant you mere mortal readerss can't even, like, grasp how brilliant she is. Yeah, Stieg? I got it when you said she has a photographic memory; I got it when she single-handedly pulled off a multinational bank scam and stole millions of kroners; I got it when she invented the software necessary to hack into a major security firm AND police headquarters; why do I need to read endless pages of her effortlessly cracking complex theoretical math problems and THEN have to hear the history of Fermat's theorem, with the added bonus of learning that she solves it in the midst of also solving baffling crimes? Can't wait for the next exciting installment, in which Lisbeth Salander resolves the unified field theory while wiping out whole armies of cyborg ninja pedophiles.<br /><br />Sorry for the sarcasm fest, fans. This is just bad.

B0039TD8LW|4.0|It is hard to say anything negative about a favorite hard rock band. Everything looks fine, the booklet, the book the collection CD. The DVD was a little disappointment. The same as the movie. I was expecting much more from Columbia Records in DVD material collection and some clips quality. It was enough the \\"Shoot To Thrill\\" and \\"The Making Of Shoot To Thrill\\". I was expecting a movie with much more AC/DC songs. It is not as bad as all that.
B002ZRPQ5K|1.0|I would say that \\"Night Train\\" is basically \\"Perfect Symmetry,\\" squared, with  more nondescript, uninspired 80s-ish fluff. However, what makes it worse than just that is that now they've added rap, from a guest star named K'Naan. It seems as though they are trying as hard as they possibly can to not sound like the Keane that we all learned to love with \\"Hopes and Fears.\\" Except that they call it \\"expanding\\" and \\"trying new things\\" and whatnot. FYI, boys, that's not a good way to solidify your fan base.

0812973992|4.0|let the great world spin, by colum mccann, is an intricate, elegant, novel with inter-locking/over-lapping storylines (in some ways, it reminded me of alice mattison's novel in short stories called women yelling, men giving money : intersecting stories, and, to a lesser extent olive kitteridge, by elizabeth strout).  the novel takes place in new york city in august 1974, on the day funambulist  philippe petit walked across a tightrope between the world trade center towers.  although petit's walk is in some sense central to the novel, his character is not.  the book follows several characters (about a dozen), most of whom have some connection to each other, whether they are aware of it or not.    the story begins in ireland, told by the brother, ciaran, of a man called by his last name, corrigan.  very early on ciaran says this of his brother: `corrigan sat on the wall, banging his heels and looking over the flat strand to the water.  i should have known even then that thse sea was written in him, that there would be some sort of leaving.' (pg 12).  young corrigan spends his time with `the drunks.'  ciaran says, `the down-and-outs needed him, or at least wanted him--he was, to them,a mad, impossible angel.' (pg 17).  corrigan's calling takes him to the bronx, where he becomes a bit of `a mad, impossible angel' to the prostitutes who walk the streets outside his apartment.  he lets them use his bathroom, buys them coffee.  when they go to jail, he tries to help get them out.  he also drives a van for a nursing home, taking some of the residents on day trips.  there is a young nurse who works at the home, adelita, with whom he has a complicated relationship.  on ciaran's first meeting with her, he describes the scene this way: `something fierce shot in the air between them.  he loosened around her, his body more pliable.  he put his hand on the small of her back...' (pg 44)    we meet mothers:  adelita has two children; tillie, a prostitute and her daughter, jazzlyn, who is also a prostitute.  jazzlyn has two very young daughters of her own.  claire, a wealthy woman living on park avenue, lost her son, joshua--a brilliant computer whiz--to a bomb in vietnam cafe; and gloria, a neighbor of corrigan, whose three sons were also killed in vietnam.    there are also fathers:  solomon and pino.  solomon, a judge, is joshua's father.  he wonders `why he bought the toy soldiers all those years ago.  he fretted over the fact that he'd made joshua learn \\"the star-spangled banner\\" on the piano.  he wondered, if, when he taught the boy to play chess, he had somehow instilled a battle mentality? ... there must have been somewhere that he'd hard-wired the boy.' (pg 263).  pino, whom we meet years after the events of 1974 (post-katrina, even) is in new york city to buy his son a chess set...    there are other characters, an artist who is involved in a terrible car accident, a young, aspiring photographer, and a young hacker from California who helps route phone calls all over to make free phone calls and ends up getting to speak to someone on her way to work the morning of the walk across the tightrope.  he gets the woman to describe the scene for him.    one of the things i found so interesting was the way the connections were made--when a revelation is made, it happens smoothly (organically to the story).  a few times i could see things coming, but not always, and in those cases i probably should have, but oh well.    it is impossible, or was impossible for me, to read this without thinking about 9/11 and the towers that are no longer there.  so much has changed in the world since the time period of this novel--as well as since the towers fell.  far-off wars still rage on, prostitutes still walk the streets, people still take their eyes off the road at the wrong moment--and also, some unlucky children still get a break, the garbage gets collected, many things, for many people are better.    this was an interesting, well-written novel.  i highly recommend it.    themes: drug addiction, prostitution (no graphic sex), suicide, alcohol use, Vietnam war, grief, poverty, religion

I know that if I get through the aerobic- that weights or abs are coming next (which I find much easier).  Good beginner work out! Like any work out DVD, the same routine gets repetetive.

B0039ZF8D2|1.0|First of all, I get that hip hop is self promoting to begin with.  I've been a hip hop and reggae head for YEARS.  The idea of mixing two legends like Jr. Gong and Nas was a great one and one can not discredit the production quality, beats, concept, or individual skills of either artist when listening to this album.  I was bordering between one and two stars and I went with one for these reasons.      Nas comes off as a self indulgent moron throughout this entire album, to be perfectly honest.  Listen to his lyrics.  He vaguely touches on issues of struggle and guns and God but with the insight and philosophy of a child.  His rhymes seem forced and his words lack the substance and positive connotations that you would expect from a seasoned \\"conscious\\" MC.  It seems that he is writing about what he THINKS he should be writing about.  I'll also say that for an album described by both artists as an \\"ode to the motherland\\" and an \\"exploration of our shared heritage\\" Nas seems completely consumed with himself.    You can really tell that Damian was the brains and blood behind this album.  They said at the Grammy museum that Damian produced a lot of it.  If you were to get rid of Nas completely, I'd give the album 3 stars.  Damian's lyrics are sharp and poignant, with an obvious knowledge of issues outside himself while remaining confident and aware of his own talent.  My problem with Damian on this record is the lack of originality and musical diversity when it comes to his melodic range.  I know his style of toasting is very repetitive (as most is), but following the same basic 3 note melody with small little changes just does not do the Marley name justice.  THIS IS BOB'S SON.  THIS IS A GRAMMY WINNING ARTIST.  Give me something really melodic and harmonious that doesn't feel like you guys sat around in the studio drinking Guiness and smoking for 3 freaking years for the equivalent to half an album from both of you.    And c'mon Nas - your picture looks like you are this wise old philosopher just thinking about all the children that need your help...am I wrong?  You come off on this album like Damian's protege's protege.  Do I have to even mention that idiocy of Lil' Wayne?!?!?  The fact that a MARLEY is doing songs with someone who has been arrested multiple times for guns and cocaine seriously makes me laugh and then want to scream.      Thanks for reading.  The new Talib Kweli album is dope.

B0000524E5|5.0|Although panned by critics, \\"Coyote Ugly\\" was geared toward the young female audience who could identify with a young woman trying to make it in New York City. Violet (Piper Perabo) heads to New York City to make it as a singer, but finds the road to success is tougher than anticipated. Violet gets a job as a waitress in the real life bar the Coyote Ugly and it is there that she makes new friends, while showing the world how great a singer she is. LeAnn Rimes did the actual singing of the Violet character as Perabo's vocals were dubbed. Rimes also makes a special guest appearance in the movie.<br /> The film was a modest success at the boxoffice, but more importantly, the soundtrack became huge, going 4X Platinum in 2008. Rimes breakout pop hit \\"Can't Fight The Moonlight\\" would go all the way to #11 on the Billboard Pop Singles Chart.<br /> The DVD is filled with bonuses including a LeAnn Rimes music video, commentaries, extra scenes, trailer, and more. The film was also directed by big-time Hollywood director Jerry Bruckheimer.<br /> In all a fun film, with great music, and characters the audience can enjoy.

B002ZFQD0E|5.0|seriously,  i never write reviews, but i am so impressed with this album. i actually really wanted to like this girl when she first came out, but her previous album wasn't quite there. this one is AMAZING. honestly its not often that i can love dancing to music so much...and not have my ears explode from listening to the lyrics (quite the opposite, these lyrics are obviously written by an intelligent human being who seems to be aware of the world around them - a real novelty in the music industry). and on top of that i think the melodies, guitar riffs, and orchestral psychadelia will actually stand up to the exacting standards of some of my friends who gave up on pop music after pink floyd left the building. i really hope this girl gets the success she deserves and doesn't get soul-sucked by the industry...tho i have a feeling they won't be putting much of this stuff on the radio cause it'll make everything else seem so pathetically banal
B003AO1SVS|5.0|I was bummed that before this album was released I couldn't hear sample clips on Amazon.  Luckily, NPR was sampling the whole album before its release.  I ordered it right after I heard the album.    I find myself listening to this album all the time.  I can't seem to get enough.  My 2 favorites are #1 Everlasting Light and #3 Tighten Up.    *Bonus* The disc changes colors.  It starts off black, but turns into a creme color after being in a player.  When I ripped it to my iTunes, I was paranoid that the black paint had melted off in my machine.  After a few seconds of panic I realized that the disc was changing its color back to black.  Now I think it's just plain awesome.    GREAT ALBUM!  Perfect for summer listening!
B001VNB54A|5.0|The Pacific is an impressive cinematographic masterpiece consisting of ten episodes (each is 45-70 minutes in length) chronicling the Pacific theater of World War II via separate but interwoven narrative threads centered on three real-life U.S. Marines (John Basilone, Robert Leckie and Eugene Sledge) who fought in five of the theater's major campaigns - Guadalcanal, Cape Gloucester, Peleliu, Iwo Jima, and Okinawa.     The series begins with a 20-minute introduction to the three central characters in the U.S. just after Pearl Harbor, and ends with a 70-minute episode dealing with the difficulties of adjusting to life back home for two of the survivors.     After my first viewing of the series in HD on HBO, I gave the series a 4-star rating, docking it by one star for its sluggish development of the main characters and supporting cast in the first four episodes. However, after Sunday's series conclusion, I immediately watched all ten (recorded) episodes again over a few days and was surprised at how much more I enjoyed those first 4 episodes.  Knowing all of the characters so well with their stellar development (and phenomenal acting) in episodes 5-9 improved the connection with the characters in the early part of the series. Armed with this knowledge and familiarity, the second viewing allowed me to focus more on the situational awareness of the characters, the details of each episode, and the quality of the production. I just began my third viewing with episode 1, and the excellence of this miniseries is even more evident the third time through ... it is no doubt worthy of a 5-star rating.     I sympathize with the criticism of the slow and uneven character development early in the series, particularly from those who created expectations within themselves for a Band of Brothers repeat from Hanks and Spielberg. But The Pacific is most definitely not, and was never intended to be, a Band of Brothers with sandy beaches and coconut palms.     BoB was a feel-good war docudrama about a single unit of men who trained for two years together before setting off for 11 months of combat in a familiar environment with known geographies and topographies and relatively civilized rules of engagement with an enemy who shared a similar cultural background. BoB introduced us to the nuts and bolts of mid-century warfare -- training, tactics and leadership roles and conflicts are central to the tale, with combat situations far more important than the presence of violence itself. The objective of BoB was to give the viewer a positive, albeit solemn, bonding experience and sense of camraderie through a story with a logical beginning and a satisfactory ending, just like the historical account written by Stephen Ambrose on which the BoB production was based.     The Pacific, on the other hand, is a chronicle of the gutting of the human soul and the devolution of the human psyche that occurred with many soldiers in the pacific theater via the real-life stories of three Marines mentioned above who served in separate units and struggled to survive in a surreal hell for nearly three years of combat. The viewer is drawn into a violent orgy of brutal jungle combat and savage coral island assaults against an unfamiliar, ruthless enemy who knows no respect for life or civilized rules of engagement. Training, tactics and leadership are peripheral, at best, to the central tale of humanity's immersion into the fires of an incomprehensible hell. The objective of The Pacific is to assault the viewer's senses with spectacular introductory combat scenes followed by a steady, raw descent into horrific violence, leaving the viewer exhausted and disturbed before reintroducing him to civilization to catch his breath so the next descent into pacific hell leaves him even more fatigued. There is no satisfactory ending ... instead the viewer is left with the keen sense of struggle that a lifetime of nightmares will bring for the war's survivors.     Given these very different characteristics and divergent objectives, it is no surprise to me that viewers with prejudicial expectations of another BoB are left frustrated by their viewing experience of The Pacific, especially given the natural character development path of episode 1 in BoB versus the disjointed familiarization process with the characters of episodes 1-4 in The Pacific. Also, those accustomed to the small, squad-sized tactical perspective of combat so prevalent in Saving Private Ryan and Band of Brothers will be disappointed that this is not a focus of The Pacific.  Rather, The Pacific's modus operandi is to immerse the viewer into the confusing chaos of large-scale battle scenes, i.e. the approach to the beaches, the banzai charges in the jungle, the crossing of the airfield on Peleliu.     In terms of scope and scale, the weighty and meaty production of The Pacific exceeds quite handily the lofty, but relatively confined, tale of brotherly love presented in BoB. There is simply nothing in BoB, except perhaps for the concentration camp scenes in \\"Why We Fight\\", that comes close to achieving the visceral experiences of episodes 6, 7 and 9 of The Pacific. And the outstanding production quality becomes more evident with each viewing.    But The Pacific's greatest strength lies in its historical accuracy and the fact that the entire production is based on the real combat experiences and writings of three U.S. Marines who served in the campaigns and battles depicted in the series.  This makes The Pacific both an interwoven memoir of the Marines who served in the theater as well as a patriotic tribute to their honorable sacrifice and interminable courage.  Hanks and Spielberg have delivered the finest cinematic salute to the U.S. Marine Corps in World War 2 ever produced.    As for some of the more ridiculous criticisms I've read -- that The Pacific is too gratuitous with foul language for the World War 2 era; that the portrayal of immoral behavior and actions by U.S. Marines isunrealistic and ahistorical; and that the depiction of sex in a couple of the episodes is typically \\"Hollywood\\" and both graphic and gratuitous -- I only have the following response: Spend some time with Marine vets of World War 2 and ask them how it really was, or view the profiles and interviews of the actual Marines portrayed in the series on YouTube (all begin with the title \\"The Pacific: Marines of the Pacific ...) . Read the books written by two of the characters in The Pacific whose work formed the basis for the production, \\"With the Old Breed\\" by Eugene Sledge and \\"Helmet for My Pillow\\" by Robert Leckie, to get a flavor for what their experience was really like. Marines really did swear a lot. Many of them were crude and callous human beings. Most of them drank gobs of alcohol. Nearly all of them became desensitized to violence and hatred and did in fact do horrible things to their Japanese enemies, dead and alive, as their souls were gutted by day upon day of brutal killing. And yes, they had plenty of sex whenever the opportunity was there ... sex was, is, and forever shall be a more important part of a soldier's life than it will ever be for a civilian's ... sex is a natural stress release. Sex feeds the positive side of the physical sensory ledger, offsetting the months of negative sensory experiences combat brings. And sex helps a soldier feel human again, and that is an integral part of The Pacific story.     I could not recommend The Pacific more highly. Just don't go into it expecting a comfortable viewing experience or a happy ending ...

1594488878|5.0|Juliet, Naked, by Nick Hornby (412 pgs., 2009).  This is Hornby's twelfth published book.  It's his sixth published fictional novel.  I've read most of his novels & seen two or three films based on his novels.  All were wonderfully humorous &/or emotionally cathartic.  This thick novel is no exception.<br /> It's about an aging rock star who no longer does anything.  He put out one album which achieved some fame, quit his band mid-tour, disappeared from the public eye, & achieved even more fame among a small but dedicated band of internet enthusiasts who parsed his every word on his most famous album:  Juliet.  The title of the book comes from the nickname given to an album released some 30-years after his disappearance which is the demo acoustic unaccompanied verson of his Juliet album.  Hence, Juliet, Naked.<br /> It's also about a 15-year non-marital but living together relationship of a couple hitting the age of 39.  The woman wonders if she's wasted those 15-years of her life.  They live in an English coastal town, once a summer vacation spot well into the 1960s, but presently just hanging on to memories of its prosperous past while heading downhill into the future.<br /> Relationships abound in this novel as the aging rock star recluse has fathered five children through the years with 4 different women, none of whom he is with anymore.  He is the full time custodial parent of his youngest child, his 6-year old son Jackson.  Finally, he seems to have gotten it right.  Hornby seems to suggest that there is hope for everyone & that wasted time & even wasted decades may not have been as wasted as one thinks.  This book sure appealed to me; especially since I have to deal with my own wasted decades.

0385341008|5.0|The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society, by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows (300 pgs., 2008).  This is one of the most moving & lovable books which I have had the pleasure of reading in many years!  I cried in so many places.  I laughed out loud in many other places.  I did both these things while reading the book in public in a restaurant.  The book is very original in that it is one of the few epistolary novels which to my knowledge has reached publication.  It is purely fictional.  All the characters & situations & the various voices of men, women & children come from the fertile mind & imagination of Mary Ann Shaffer.  This elderly American was able to inhabit the minds & attitudes of English folks (both posh & common), people of Guernsey, a rich American abroad, & German Nazis (as occupiers of Guernsey during WWII).  This novel is ostensibly about how the island of Guernsey & its people fared under their five year occupation by the Germans during WWII.  It is about so much more.  It is about love.  It is about bravery.  It is about selflessness.  It is about small mindedness.  It is about petty jealousies.  It is about loving eccentricities.  It is about smart children.  It is about the adults who love them.  It is about adults who have no love in them.  It is a balanced look at  the evil people do to each other.  It is about triumphing over evil.  Sadly, Shaffer didn't live to see the success of this book.  Her niece, Barrows, made the major changes which saw this book reach publication.  Shaffer lived to see it published.
B002S0OBMS|5.0|I admit I am an ALW fan. When Phantom first came out, I wasn't a fan - how could you put this story to music???  BUT  I later fell in love with the music, the characters, etc.  Yes it is romantic, yes it is the Beauty in the Beast but the Beast doesn't win in the end. So when I saw that ALW wrote a sequel to Phantom I had to have it.  Reviews have been all over the chart from one star to five stars but I decided I would listen with an open mind even if my favorite songs are from Phantom.  I just finished listening to the recording.  I loved the music - it is VERY different from the music from the original Phantom BUT it fits the story which takes place at Coney Island. Conceptually, the story takes an interesting twist and develops the main characters, albeit in ways that many fans may not like.  It is a STORY - not real life.   Listen to it with an open mind - the music is not related to Phantom - the relation between the 2 musicals is that the same characters are in both.  Like life - things change, people change, events happen that change people particularly after 10 years. Judge the music on whether it fits the location, the story, the characters not whether it matches the original Phantom.  You can call anything a sequel but whether it fails or not should never be based on the original.

0061922315|5.0|Shilpi Somaya Gowda's first book is excellent.  I'm already looking forward to her second.<br /><br />Her writing is rich and descriptive and beautiful -- yet not overly flowery at all.<br /><br />SECRET DAUGHTER is a lovely story that takes us to two countries -- U.S. (San Francisco) and India -- and spans 25 years.  We meet Kavita and Jasu who are living in a small Indian village.  Girl babies are expensive (their dowries later) and can't help with the farming, so they are highly undesirable.  When Kavita has her 2nd daughter, she is determined to save her by taking her to the orphanage.<br /><br />Somer and Krishna are two doctors -- he an emigrant from India from a fairly well-to-do family, and her a white blonde only child who has been surrounded with love and support.  When they have trouble conceiving, Krishna's mom sends them information about adoption from India.<br /><br />I loved this book.  The characters were mostly likable and definitely real.  The story is told from the POV of the women in the story.  Along with them, we explore the changes that a marriage goes through with age and stress, and the difficulties and joys of raising children.  Because the whole book follows two families over such a long period of time, the surface is barely scratched, and yet, the reader completely understands.<br /><br />The story moved me, and the characters will be with me for a long long time.

B002GY9F9K|5.0|This show is based  on a novel series by Terry Goodkind, and follows Richard Cypher (Craig Horner) on his quest to defeat evil ruler Darken Rahl (Craig Parker). He is accompanied on his journey by Kahlan Amnell (Bridget Regan), a beautiful woman with magical abilities known as a Confessor, and a wizard  by the name of Zeddicus Zu'l Zorander (Bruce Spence).     Set against the magical scenery of New Zealand, Legend of The Seeker was Created by Sam Raimi, the same guy behind shows like Hercules and Xena (also filmed in New Zealand). Like those shows, it has much of the same sense of adventure and humor, and it doesn't take itself too seriously - although it has a darker tone and  far less slapstick humor than the other two shows. The production values are also much higher on Seeker. And despite being a weekly television series it manages to maintain a grand and epic adventure feel. Writing, casting, acting and fight choreography are all excellent. The direction is beautiful and visually pleasing, it really draws you in. It makes for perfect escapism from everyday life. What more could you ask from a fantasy television series.     It is without a doubt one of the most fun, entertaining and addictive shows of its genre in a very long time. But unfortunately, it is hanging in the balance in regards to whether a third season will be made. So if you were ever considering to buy the box set, now is the time. If you're a fantasy fan, or you like epic adventure and romance, then you will love Legend of The Seeker!

0679736646|4.0|'Ubik' is one of the best places to introduce yourself to Philip K. Dick. The story contains a number of his trademarks, but it is also one of his more straightforward books and contains a number of elements that would be familiar to many sci-fi fans.     The story itself is multi-faceted. The set-up involves Glen Runciter and his organisation of \\"anti-talents\\", who are a sort of futuristic industrial counter-espionage. When a large-scale operation to the Moon goes badly wrong, Runciter is killed and his employees find reality beginning to disintegrate; time going backwards, Runctiner contacting them from beyond the grave, and themselves frighteningly wasting away. The bulk of the book deals with the efforts of the characters to figure out the cause of this degradation and how it can be stopped.     The book contains plenty of standard Philip K. Dick elements. Protagonist Joe Chip is the standard down-on-his-luck \\"everyman\\" hero, with Pat being the cooly mysterious female lead. The dynamic between Joe and Pat is fascinating, with her highly original anti-talent possibly being connected to the bizzare circumstances in which they find themselves. Likewise, the idea of a warped or illusional reality is a standard feature among many of Dick's books, and is utilised well here. In addition, I particularly enjoyed the concept of \\"anti-talent\\", which  highlights Dick's influence on the Cyberpunk genre. In his world, telepathy and precognition are not always used for good, and Dick has some interesting ideas about how they may be employed in an offensive manner against rival organisations.     The story fits together well; all of the pieces seem to be nicely in place by the end, only to have the final chapter throw in a disquietening twist that leaves the ending open. This is reinforced by the ominous introduction to the final chapter, which is complete change from the cheesy advertisement parodies than introduce the earlier chapters (\\"Eat Ubik toasted flakes\\"/\\"Get soft andsupple hair with Ubik conditioner\\"/\\"Borrow from Ubik Savings and Loan\\"!). A clever and well-executed touch.     One issue I have with this book (and several other of Dick's books) is what might diplomatically be called his \\"matter-of-fact\\" writing. His quite dry style makes it difficult to get emotionally involved with the circumstances or the characters. The characters themselves (apart from Joe, Pat and Glen) are somewhat poorly sketched, and often abruptly die or disappear \\"off camera\\". Also, his predictions for 1992 were way off. Keep in mind the book was published in 1969, so it wasn't as if he was looking a hundred years hence; even allowing for the fact that this might be a deliberately \\"ironic\\" or alternate-reality approach, his predictions of hovercars and lunar colonies seem very dated in retrospect.     It is a pity that Dick couldn't bring out a little more emotion in the book, and really give a detailed insight into what the characters go through in such a bizzare situation. This means that 'Ubik' succeeds brilliantly as an intellectual puzzle but falls a little short as a novel. But if you can forgive that, 'Ubik' is a clever and thought-provoking science fiction book, and is the best place to introduce yourself to the original but disturbing world of Philip K. Dick.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Live at the Troubadour debuted at no 4 on the Billboard charts this week.<br /><br />There is something you may not know, and you may not know that you don't know it.<br />James Taylor got his big break when he was signed by The Beatles to Apple Records.<br />The song that got him signed by George Harrison and Paul McCartney was 'Something in the way she moves.'  Interestingly the opening line of George Harrison's song Something is 'Something in the way she moves.'<br /><br />Live at the Troubadour marks a full circle moment for artists King and Taylor whose musical careers as artists have been inextricably intertwined.  When King heard Carole King perform 'You've Got a Friend' at the Troubadour in 1970, he was instantly smitten by the song, and when he later worked with her on Tapestry, she gave him permission to release a single of the song, ensuring a number one hit for him, the biggest hit of his career.<br /><br />As you consider that it's almost 40 years, it's quite amazing to get some of the original Tapestry musicians such as Danny Kortchmar, and Leland Sklar on this cd/dvd.  In additon drummer Chris Kunkel played drums on Fire and Rain.<br /><br />With this richness of musical talent, as you watch the cameras zoom in closer and tighter than you can imagine, you gain a sense of the intimacy of the Troubadour, you gain a fresh appreciation of these artists, and these classics.  You probably heard many most of these songs before, but may not have experienced these artists combining quite like this before now, with all these classic songs, and that's enough to take you all the way back, the further back you go, the more you want to reexperience it over and over.<br /><br />Watching the dvd, it's a smaller venue than you might have imagined, and the cameramen have to tread carefully to not be intrusive, sometimes a guitarists arm might block  a view of Carole King.<br /><br />I particularly liked their fresh takes on these classics, particularly It's Too Late, and So Far Away, and Carolina in my mind.<br /><br />I don't know if you've ever been up on the roof, watching your cares and woes drift right into space, if you have not you can probably imagine what it's like to be above the hustling crowd driting away, and The Drifters could definitely appreciate the word drift being used in a song that they might record, written by a lyrical genius such as Gerry Goffin.  And you can allow yourself to drift away, when you get the cd and dvd.

B00361DR4Q|5.0|\\"La Traviata\\" is my favourite opera so be aware of some prejudice. This copy joins 9 other videos and one CD set (Callas) of the opera.  It rarely fails to tear at the heartstrings and gives the lead soprano great opportunities for vocal and emotional display. And the lovely Angela Gheorghiu achieves all this in spades backed up very competently by Ramon Vargas and Robert Frontali. These two male singers perform very well although I would not claim they are the best available but I give full marks to Angela Gheorghiu to be at least as good as Fleming, Gruberova, Netrebo and others. I also have her performing this opera on laserdisc with Domingo where Solti was the conductor but this latest effort eclipses her earlier one.<br /><br />As we have come to expect from Blu Ray the audio and video are top notch so the glorious orchestra music under Maazel's baton comes through beautifully. It seems this disc is being phased out so is now available at very reasonable prices so if you are tempted, hesitate no longer. Thoroughly recommended.
B002ZG98VE|4.0|Ridley Scott and Russell Crowe have now done four movies together, the most notable of which is undoubtedly Gladiator, a fantastic story, and a brilliantly realised movie in the tradition of Braveheart.<br /><br />With Robin Hood director and actor would  face a story and a character, portrayed many times in movies and tv series. Robin Hood has been played by actors as diverse as Sean Connery, Kevin Costner, Patrick Bergin and Errol Flynn. Even Mel Brooks did a series Robin Hood Men in tights.<br /><br />Inevitably, if you are like me, you will make comparisons with your other experiences of Robin Hood.  Bravely, it attempts to tell the story in a fresh and invigorating way, exploring the story before the story you already know.<br /><br />Firstly, in this story Robin Hood is not yet Robin Hood, but Robin Longstride, a man of uncertain origin and we suspect less than noble birth, and we meet him on the battlefields of France, fighting the cause of King Richard. Robin calls out the King's reckless crusade, and Robin and his three friends end up in the stocks, and so the adventure begins.<br /><br />Eventually, Robin and his men escape, and Robin assumes the identity of a dying nobleman, and agrees to carry out his last wish, which leads him to  Lady Marion.<br /><br />Usually King Richard plays as a heroic character still abroad, and Prince John remains a scheming prince.  Here however John becomes the King, and undergoes somewhat of an unlikely transformation from weakling mamas boy Prince to tyrant King.<br /><br />This presents a dilemma in accepting the story as given.  Sometimes while watching this movie, particuarly action scenes you may feel like you are watching Braveheart or Gladiator.<br /><br />Apparently, Russell Crowe walked out of a BBC radio interview, when the British presenter, suggested his accent was Irish not English, Russell responding bollocks, and telling 'you got dead ears, mate.  You got to love Russell.<br /><br />Being Irish myself, I did think there was one scene where he had a slight lilt, other than that I found nothing wrong with the accent.  In any event, I don't think Sean Connery has ever done anything other than a Scottish accent, even when he won the Academy Award playing an Irish policeman with a Scottish accent.<br /><br />So, I rate this movie three and a half stars.  I think you will enjoy it, without necessarily being wowed.  If the story elements had been more consistent with other versions I definitely would have enjoyed it more.<br /><br />What I liked most about this movie was him releasing the arrow in slow motion with drops of water flying off, and I also like the Little John character, who you may recognise as a villain from Lost.<br /><br />I hope you found this review helpful.han that I found nothing wrong with the accent.

6305922756|4.0|\\"Spinal Tap\\" is right-on satire of a wacky 1980's heavy metal band.  The story is weird but you have the gut feeling it is a perceptive lampoon of what was going on in the 80's rock gigs.  Rob Reiner plays Director Marty DiBergi and effectively keeps the story line focused.  Michael McKean, Christopher Guest, and Harry Shearer are fantastic as they keep their characters real and slightly off regular logic.  Of course we have to remember we are visiting a different universe for the British Heavy Metal Band.<br /><br />The movie was somewhat sad in that the meaning of success for men in their 40's is to act forever young - not quite adults being shuttled from town to town giving bizarrely ludicrous interviews. Spinal Tap is full of inside jokes for those in the music industry, as well as a vicarious look into the lives of a rock band for the average \\"Joe\\" and wannabees.<br /><br />Overall, \\"Spinal Tap\\" was fun to watch and the dysfunctional group hit every rock star cliche.
B001GCUNW6|5.0|Awesome movie, i have the dvd, blu ray and the digital copy on my ipod.
B002ZRPQ5K|3.0|After listening to this album for a week, i have grown to like \\"Stop For A minute\\" \\"Clear Skies\\" and \\"Your Love\\". As divided my opinion is, I think the best track (and most grounded) is Stop for a minute. People complain about the rapping, but Knaan's verse is great and fits well with the song. \\"Clear Skies\\" is a true gem and I love it. \\"Your Love\\" is almost perfect, except for Rice-Oxley's vocals, whose pale in comparison to Chaplin's. As listening to Your Love, I sometimes wish chaplin was singing the track. This is a cute little ablum Keane released, but does not soar like Under The Iron Sea or Hopes & Fears. I also wish they would try somthing different other than the 80's synth pop again. But as a big Keane fan, I will enjoy anything they put out, even if it's tepid for their standards.
030745455X|5.0|Our girl with the dragon tatoo who loves her privacy is front page news and on the run.  Lisbeth tries to distance herself from Kalle Blomkvist but again their destinies are linked.  Stieg Larsson delivers a sophisticated tangled web of suspense. I couldn't put it down. My only complaint is the wait for the next installment...
B00065VTU4|5.0|461 Ocean Boulevard was a fine album when it came out in '74. Not what we, Clapton fans, were waiting for, but it had good moments and Clapton seemed to be onto something new he dug himself (J. J. Cale, Marley). We know the history and what happened next. \\"There's one in every crowd\\", the follow up, was maligned by many, but it is still one of my favorites. You come back to \\"461\\" 30+ years hence and you know it is, and has been, one of his best.    This Deluxe edition tops the original outing. Some may carp that the additional songs on Disc one already were available elsewhere. So what? Play the album and then you come to these relaxed bluesy songs at the end of disc 1...They're a fine complement to what has just preceded. Disc 2 forms the logical consequence and counterpart of Disc 1: A live recording by this same new band at the end of their tour. The performances are fine; it's a disc I take pleasure in playing every now and then. And that's enough. It isn't better than the original \\"461\\" or other 70's live Clapton, but it has a mood of its own that fits \\"461\\". So, for once, this expanded set makes sense and it is an enhancement over the original. Recommended for those who appreciate Clapton (and have for many years), but also to newer Clapton fans. \\"461\\" is definitely one of his best and still holds it own.
B002VPE1B6|3.0|Great movie but NO SPECIAL FEATURES!!!  I would have been willing to wait for the special feature version.  It's just another way for them to make money!  MAYBE they couldn't get all the stuff together for the SF so they decided to release just the movie.  But I think if they had explained it, the fans would have understood.  Now we have to buy the movie all over again when the SF version comes out.  More money needlessly going out the window.    Conclusion:  Great movie, poor public relations!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|this was awesome.  Unfortunately I was not able to see it on the big screen but even on the little screen it was great.  It had all the marks love story, war story, good vs evil.  Color and imagery were just spectacular.  Reminded me of the first time I saw star wars.  Everyone should see this movie
1439153663|5.0|Fans of the wildly successful, \\"The Help\\", or the less known, but equally as riveting \\"Mudbound\\" should feel right at home here with the story of an orphaned Irish immigrant girl who ends up the indentured servant to a Southern family, finding a surrogate family among the black slaves who work the plantation. Young seven year old Lavinia's story is shared with Belle, the mixed race daughter of the plantation owner, who hides the secret of her birthright from his wife and family. It's been awhile since I literally couldn't put a book down, but that was the case here. And although at times the desperate story felt like it teetered on melodrama, it didn't detract from what is ultimately a terrific read, that moves towards a shocking and moving conclusion.
B0039TD7RC|3.0|After listening to the new tracks that Don Was supposedly produced, I heard the same old loud JAGGER drowning out Keith, Charlie, Mick Taylor, and Bill Wyman. Don Was allows Jaggers voice to overide the all the guitars, drums, and other instruments like he's done on all the other newer albums. Exile was great because of the balance in guitar harmony with Jaggers singing. But not anymore on the new tracks. What happened to the Glimmer Twins and Glynn Johns producing Stones tracks?
B001IBIHQ4|4.0|I thought it was a good series but it was not at the same level as Band of Brothers. This should have been called \\"The Marines in the Pacific\\" rather than just the Pacific because that is what was concentrated on. It was a good series though and definitely worth watching. Hope Hanks and Co continue to make more of these types of series. I'd like to see as many as they want to make.
B0039TD7RC|5.0|Already several reviews/opinion pieces out there--as if \\"Exile on Main Street\\" needed further review. For the main album I refer to the review by \\"A Customer\\" for earlier CD editions (it's the leading review). Captures the essence as well as anything I've read.    My opinion on key questions regarding this new Deluxe Edition:  1. Remastering: Sound buffs may disagree, but to me the new version sounds very good, slightly improved over the Virgin remaster. You can hear more detail; the trademark \\"muddiness\\" (voices and instruments at about the same volume level) has not been compromised. Most important to me: Nothing as offensive as the remastering job on Sticky Fingers, and later albums. (Why, Oh, Why?).    2. Second disc: sound blurbs on Amazon site do not do the \\"new\\" songs justice. Play the disc and it is just like a new early 70's style Stones album. Not as good as the original Exile or Sticky Fingers, but fine indeed. A most pleasant finding; this includes the first several songs on the disc with recently added vocals. Makes me think that there would be nothing wrong about a new Stones album in this style, and: Why is no one doing any of this stuff nowadays? That's a different story, but the songs are THAT good that the idea comes up by itself.    3. My only gripe is the packaging. It's dismal. It starts with the color of the cover: sepia instead of pure B&W. What the heck?! Then the cover has been cropped--pictures near the edges of the old album are missing. What's with that? The 1994 Virgin booklet is excellent and offers everything one ever needs. That includes prominently the covers of the sleeves of the original LPs, which are mssing in this \\"Deluxe Edition\\". There's simply no acceptable explanation.  Now, if I could really have my way, this edition would be a three-CD issue with separate CD's for the first and second LP of the original album and a third for the new songs. That way you could have the original sleeve covers (with song titles) behind the first two discs. As the \\"A Customer\\" review points out: this album is like a long extended song (something like an LP-side long jazz improvisation). LP1 and LP2 always had a different feel to me and it would be nice to have this available in CD format too (especially since the song titles are not printed on the disc). But, OK, that's nitpicking and not of the greatest importance.    What we have here is good and the sound seems to have been improved over the earlier versions. And that's the main point.
B000MPOF4K|5.0|This tea is very unique as a blend of African/Kenyan, Assam, and Ceylon teas. This is definitely \\"Best enjoyed with milk.\\" as the full-flavor strength balances well even with heaps of milk. This is especially useful if generous with adding milk to hot beverages, as I am! Even without milk, the tea is suprisingly smooth for being a strong tea which makes it unlike many other black teas I've tried.<br /><br />Although it doesn't appear to indicate Full Flavor Strength on the packaging pictured here, the blends are indentical to slightly different packaging by the same brand in Australia. Here they indicate it is Full Flavor Strength with five filled tea leaves on the front of the package.<br /><br />It appears based on the information on Amazon that this tea is a cross between the [[ASIN:B000F4H5GI Twinings Irish Breakfast Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)]] (Ceylon and Assam)and the [[ASIN:B000F4F952 Twinings English Breakfast Tea, Tea Bags, 50-Count Boxes (Pack of 6)]] (Kenyan and Assam ) and yet this is an afternoon tea. However not to be confused with [[ASIN:B000F4DKAI Twinings English Afternoon Tea, Tea Bags, 20-Count, 1.41 oz. Boxes (Pack of 6)]] (Keemun and Ceylon) which is entirely different and probably tastes different enough too.
034544678X|5.0|We had 2 adult dogs and just added a new puppy to the mix.  It was more trouble than we expected.  This book is very helpful in dealing with dog behavior.  I learned a lot of wonderful tips and I plan on re-reading the book often.  I've read many dog training books, but this one dealt with dog behavior and why they act the way they do.  It was fascinating!  This is the best dog book I've read and I've read a lot!!
0618918248|5.0|This book offers arguments against the existence of any god.     It argues against the arguments against science, and it offers logical and scientific answers to critics.    For those who are religious, this book should provide a good challenge to your faith. If you aren't scared of a good challenge, I'll speak for all atheists by daring you to read this book.    The only pitfall of this book is that it may offend some religious people with it's strong attacks, but that's not much of a pitfall.    There was at least 1 reviewer who said the arguments aren't strong enough and that this book focuses too much on the trivial. This book never said it was going into hard science for physicists. Expect this book to be legible to the average reader with normal terminology anyone can grasp.
B0002V7OI8|5.0|Deep Impact and Armageddon release dates were close together, but differently revealing the possibility of impending doom. Although Armageddon was most entertaining and fun, Deep Impact was a slap of reality that dug deep into the personal lives of heroes and victims, not to mention a planet on the verge of total destruction. (We loved the diversity of both movies, so we bought them both.)<br /><br />The graphics effects of both movies were outstanding, but those of Deep Impact, again, were made believable by the interjection of so many lives touched by an impending disaster.<br /><br />The purpose of casting Morgan Freeman as President of the US escapes me, unless the producers wanted us to think that \\"this is just a movie, not reality.\\" If that was their motive, they failed. Freeman made it even more real to us, as he appeared very Presidential. His familiar face made the movie an even more future possibility.<br /><br />The Bible speaks of a future disaster like the one depicted in Deep Impact, created by a meteor named Wormwood. It speaks of one third of mankind dying in the wake of its power. After seeing this movie, and that image joined with my knowledge of Biblical prophesy will be forever etched in my mind, as we all wait for what I believe to be the inevitable.
0307271862|1.0|It is hard to fathom what Mankell was thinking when he wrote this book. He sets a very high standard with the Wallander series, so it makes the plot in this story really hard to understand.    The book actually starts out pretty well. There is a mass murder of Swedish citizens tangentially involving a Swedish judge. From there it is all down hill. A way overly long description of 2 Chinese men building the American railway leads to a series of coincidences and intersections of characters in China and Zimbabwe that are beyond improbable.    There are many problems with this story, but it seems the main plot line, the mass murder, is largely ignored. The murder of every citizen in a village seems to be investigated by 2 local cops, who don't seem particularly interested in finding out who comitted the murders. There is no real development of the invetigation nor is there ever any detailed description of how the actual murders took place.    The main plot moves to China and Zimbabwe. It appears that Mankell's motivation for writing this book may have been to show his leftist or Marxist sympathies. He even tries to portray Robert Mugabe in a favorable light as a misunderstood post colonial African leader.     If Mankell's other books weren't so great then perhaps the low quality of this plot would not be so shocking. My recommendation is to avoid this book at all costs!
B002BPQ0Y2|2.0|After buying several individual songs from this album, i decided to jump for the entire album. I realize now that there really was no point: a good portion of this is mediocre to just plain awful music (One Tribe and Now Generation are particularly terrible). For every good song like \\"Meet Me Halfway\\" you have a clunker like \\"Ring-A-Ling\\". Honestly after about track 6 (\\"Alive\\"), the rest of the album is disposable, the only exception being maybe \\"Rockin To The Beat\\". There's a quote out there where will.i.am said the album format was dead. If groups like Black Eyed Peas keep making a couple of good songs, mixed with a bunch of garbage, then try to release it as an \\"album\\" then maybe will.i.am is right.
006135323X|5.0|The author presents some new insights that can help one gain a deeper understanding of irrational behavior in daily life.  A key concept is that of relativity.  Most human decisions are based on comparisons, and different conclusions are arrived at depending on what we choose to compare to.<br /><br />What if there's nothing available for comparison?  People will find an arbitrary \\"anchor\\" to compare to.  The author demonstrates that people will even use their social security numbers as anchors to determine what they will pay for something.  Another example of relativity and anchoring is when the first bread making machine was introduced, people viewed it as too expensive (they had nothing similar to compare it to).  The product didn't sell until the same firm introduced a deluxe, higher priced machine.  Then the original model started selling (because the original model was now a bargain compared to the deluxe version).<br /><br />A second major concept is that human decisions made in an aroused, emotional state (caused by desire, fear, or anger) are different from those made in a cold, rational state.  Thus, it is to our advantage to stay in a cold, rational state when making important decisions.  On the other hand, when selling a product or idea, we will be more successful if we can appropriately arouse the buyer.  The author provides examples demonstrating that people are irrationally aroused when offered something for FREE.<br /><br />In summary, this book is a valuable tool in understanding the irrational nature of human decision making.
1416979174|5.0|This book is about a seed who didn't know he was going to get planted.  One seed got on fire.  One fell into the ocean.  The second seed didn't get any sun.

0385737424|5.0|We read this for a mother/daughter book club.  It was a real page-turner, very entertaining and even suspenseful.   There were some great subjects for discussion.  Our girls are in 4th grade.  This book included: the catty way girls can be with each other, which was full of misunderstandings; how boys and girls can be friends, but that it's complicated; a little something magical and mysterious; a little racial prejudice; socio-economic issues. All of it in a way that young people can relate to without being shocked but definitely surprised and hopefully a little uncomfortable.

If you dont like this cd then go back to your mainstream radio.
B001OQCV6A|3.0|You enjoy quiz shows on TV because you think it exercises your brain.  You met your wife online, but made up a story about \\"love at first sight while in college\\" to tell others because you're a little embarrassed.  And your favorite number is your birth date.  In summary, you have too much discretionary income and not enough discretion in your viewing habits.      The largest problem this movie offers is probably my own.  My expectation.    I expected a movie about the worlds greatest detective would let me play along, and in the end, when he points out all that I missed, I would agree that he is brilliant.  However, there is no game to play here.  1. Because you're not included and 2. it's spelled out (outside of Moriarity's interests).      In the end, Holmes lists all the things he saw that you didn't, but not because you're quiz shows aren't in fact helping you think, but because you're never really shown anything.  I tasted this; I smelled that; I noticed this.  All of this happens behind the scenes, or behind the mind of Holmes, and there's no way for us to peer inside and smell, etc for ourselves.    Sherlock Holmes stays on the surface - a bloody, snarky skin - and only hints at something more toward the end.  Really, the end is the only moderately decent portion, but only because you hear of the \\"Moriarty\\" character, whose just as brilliant as Holmes is.  The problem in mentioning this is, of course, the thought that it leads to: \\"If he's so fantastic, why isn't he the main antagonist here?\\"  The character makes me feel that I want to see THAT movie, the one with Moriarty, not this one.    But fear not!  Sequel!  One has been fast tracked and will be out in a year or two.  But let's discuss the problems of here and now.    What this movie is is an action movie.  That's it.  If you're OK with that, you'll be OK with this.  But there's nothing memorable here.  The only chance of something that will linger is the whisper this movie could have been more.  A little less punch to the face, and a lot more kick to the brain, if you please.  Perhaps we'll get that for Sherlock Holmes 2: The Revenge of Gladstone.
0694003611|5.0|Book was in almost perfect condition. It was shipped super fast, and I am extremely pleased with it.

Always a wonderful bedtime story and easy for younger children to further their growing interests in reading.
0810995212|1.0|I purchased this book thinking a scholarly biography had at last been written. What a let down! It is filled with the tall tale stories often repeated but historically inaccurate and lots of unfounded opinions. No documentation. If the price is affordable to you, you certainly could buy it for the images- Leyendecker's work stands on its own. Otherwise, skip it and join the waiting line with me for someone to publish a quality book on this great illustrator.

B00110K62U|5.0|That's basically what I screamed at the end of this...in a slightly more colorful way. There are over 200+ reviews on the concert, so I'll just say this: if you can only buy one concert version of Les Miserables, this is the one to get.  Every.single.performer is on point.  I cheered, I stomped, I air pumped my fist in the general awesomness of it.  This is what I have playing on the TV when I'm doing housework - it makes everything go so much faster...except when I stop to play air violin during a song, which is kinda like air guitar, only slightly lamer.  Anyway, buy this.

1439102813|5.0|Definitely a must read for everybody. Lisa Genova's debut novel is short and simple but has so much depth and emotion all throughout the book. It's sad but truly believable. As of 2010, statistics shows that every 70 seconds, someone in America is diagnosed with Alzheimer's. The fictional story of Alice, a brilliant professor in Harvard University who was dianosed with early Alzheimers's, is only one of 5 million stories of people afflicted with this disease in America today. If we can read long complicated books about different parts of the world and about cultures and issues that are not relevant to our present day society, we can and must read this book. The issue is very current and will be current for a long time; it's in our neighborhood, our backyard and in our family; it's in our past, in our present and realistically in our future. I thank Lisa Genova for this book. The story will stay with me forever.
B000AMU0XA|5.0|One of the best CDs of the 1980s - it was like the Pink Floyd of the clubs.  Incredible production, great musicianship, a theme album that takes you all over the map from club, dance, rock.  Holly Johnson was an instant star as the rest of the band.  Trevor Horn produces who has also produced Art Of Noise and Yes.  One of the best double albums I had the pleasure of buying.  This CD was popular in rock clubs, dance clubs, gay clubs, radio and MTV embraced it.  I wish they were still creating music today.  This one is a complete gem.  A winner.  Classic.  This one is great to listen to blaring on a great music system or in headphones.  Sit back and take the ride!

1439190275|5.0|In some ways, it's the standard fare: chapters about the principles around which the diet was based, chapters about how to actually implement the diet, meal plans, recipes. But there are two major things that make this book stand out in my mind.<br /><br />Deconstructs all the potential straw-men<br /><br />One of the oft-repeated characterization (caricature?) of the Atkins approach is that it's all about eggs and sausage all the time. While this book is no exception in extolling the virtues of eggs and high-quality, full-fat protein, it explicitly calls out the value of what are referred to as `foundation' vegetables. Simply described as the `non-starchy' vegetables (leafy greens, cruciferous, etc.). These vegetables are part of the plan form day 1 (even in the `induction' phase). They have even included options for vegetarians and vegans. That's right: a vegetarian Atkins dietary plan - strange bedfellows, indeed.<br /><br />Overwhelms you with clinical evidence<br /><br />Just as the doctor stated, the big payoff for me in this book was chapters 13 and 14 which they clearly have targeted to skeptical clinicians. They reiterate all the relevant biochemistry, cite their many successful interventions and buttress their arguments by citing no fewer than 71 publications in peer-reviewed journals that support their approach. Seventy one.<br /><br />In terms of down-to-earth, practical advice combined with scientific and clinical support for said advice, this book is now at the top of the heap (edging out `6-Week Cure') of books I will recommend to those who want to alter their nutritional practices to benefit their overall health.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|An outstanding video !!  Joe is a great guitarist and the sound and video quality is second to none on this video.  After I purchased and listened to this video I ended up purchasing two more of the same video for two of my friends. This is by far the best concert dvd I have in my collection !!!  Highly Recommended !
B0039TD7RC|4.0|Just got this in the mail, i was very surprised to not see the alternate version of \\"All down the line\\" I had pre-ordered the deluxe version, but decided to purchase the i-tunes version the day of release, glad I did as it contains the before mentioned alternate version of All Down The Line, having heard the new (old) tracks for a couple of days, it was easily my new favorite song on the re-release. check it out!
B000SW16NU|4.0|Good movie!  It took me 5 years from it's original release for me to see it, but I'm glad I finally did.  This is a noble dramatization of how some leaders' consciences may have played out during the crusades, and specifically, the seige of Jerusalem.  The moral, religious, and philosophical approaches all held something that everyone could appreciate.  Great action, too.
1449536689|5.0|Wilkie Collins' \\"The Moonstone,\\" an epistolary mystery story published in 1868, often is cited as one of the first, if not the first, detective novels ever written.  No less a literary luminary than T.S. Eliot attributed to Collins the \\"invention\\" of the detective novel genre.  \\"The Moonstone\\" is certainly an excellent mystery story, featuring what would become staples of classic Western detective fiction -- an amateur detective, a renown professional investigator, incompetent policemen, multiple false leads and red herrings, and an \\"inside job.\\"  It's also subtly laced with social commentary about class, race, sexuality, religious evangelism and substance abuse in Victorian England during a period when the British Empire ruled about a quarter of the world's population.  For anyone interested in the genesis and evolution of the modern socially conscious detective novel, \\"The Moonstone\\" is impossible to ignore.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Received the movie on release date because of pre-order.  This is an outstanding video and has been watched many times by my family.  The fact that Amazon honors the lowest price is a very nice feature of pre-order and insures that you get the best value for your money.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|Avatar is one of the most visually exciting movies I have ever seen, Being an earth spirit myself I felt the same link the Na'vi feel with Pandora. The spirit of the planet is within us all it's how you feel about living on this beautiful planet as to the effect you will feel about this movie. If you think about the computer generated facial features and movements, James Cameron created a new Genre of perfection in CGI. Thanks James for Creating something that will go down in history as one of the landmark films of this century. I can't wait for the next 2 films.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|It is a great movie. I am sure that most people have already seen it buy now and plenty have already bought the bluray/dvd. My opinion is thought i found the blu ray experience better than the 3D experience. So much more clear and all the details they put into the movie are so much more noticeable
0439023491|5.0|I'll leave the storyline review and literary critique to others more qualified here. My review is as a mother of a 13-year-old boy who has a hard time finding books he just loves.<br /><br />He read Hunger Games a year or so ago and said he couldn't wait for Catching Fire. I got it as soon as I could. Unfortunately, he read the summary and thought it just couldn't be as good as the first one so he didn't even try to read it. It sat for months. FINALLY, we were on a long trip and I stuck the book in his backpack hoping he'd read it. Not only did he read it, he read it in three days.<br /><br />He couldn't put it down! I was so pleased he didn't even pick up a game controller one time. He was completely engrossed in the story line. He did relay a few questionable scenes that seemed a bit graphic. There is no lack of death in this book, for sure. I wouldn't recommend this for anyone much younger than a teenager for that reason.<br /><br />I give any book that holds my teenage son's attention for three straight days an A+. We've already pre-ordered the next book in the series.
0446825670|4.0|This book was written in the 70's, and I wish I had read it back then. I am an avowed sugar addict who is trying to amass so much information about sugar's detriments that I'm forced to give it up. To an extent, I'm slowly getting there, but it is a constant battle. Dufty's book, although it is not a scientific work, is an astute observation of advertising and political strategies that have allowed the infiltration of this dangerous substance into our lives, until it is in absolutely EVERYTHING. The section about how much sugar is in tobacco products was suggestive and eye-opening; he makes a suggestion that lung cancer is potentiated more by the sugar than the tobacco (using rough figures of lung cancer overseas and in the US). While this is not a scientifically-supported statement, it is worth looking into. Most of the book is a historical and political analysis of sugar's place in the growth of the world's consumer culture, stretching back into the days of the Crusades, when the Europeans wanted some of that Saracen sugar and would fight to get it. He points the finger at Fannie Farmer for suggesting that a little sugar added to just about every recipe would improve it. Now, 30-some years after he writes this, sugar (or HFCS, which wasn't invented til the 70's) is in nearly everything we buy at the store. It is more ubiquitous than spices like onion and garlic, which are added to just about every savory item in can or box or packet. His work is prescient in many ways, but also shows how constant the attitude of big commercial concerns are in their fight against inconvenient truths. A good book to start with; there is much more scientific data available now on what sugar does to the body (a lecture by Dr. Lustig on how closely the effects of fructose on the body jibe with the now-medically recognized \\"metabolic syndrome\\" is instructive). A good book to start becoming informed about the killer white crystals in your cupboard.
B002RSDW80|4.0|As most of my friends could tell you, I am no cook.  But when I saw this movie I began to believe that if Julie Powell could cook all 524 of the recipes in Julia Childs' book \\"Mastering The Art of French Cooking\\", then maybe I could at least cook.<br /><br />\\"Julie and Julia\\" tells two stories.  First is the tale of Julia Childs moving from learning to cook French to publishing a best selling cookbook.  Meryl Streep is convincing in her task of playing the culinary legend Julia Child.  Stanley Tucci is brilliant in playing Julia's gentle and supporting husband, Paul.  The scenes of Julia's adventure in locations in  Paris, are realistic and beautiful.  Paul's patience as his wife struggles with critics and the snobbery of the French cooking school owner is the stuff of legend.<br /><br />The second story relates how a frustrated government office worker releases her hidden writing and cooking talents in a effort to cook all of Child's recipes within 365 days and record her efforts in an Internet blog.  Amy Adams does an outstanding job of portraying Julie Powell and the challenge and emotionally charged effort.  We see the impressive dedication the project requires and Julie knows it.  When a friend says that acquaintances claim Julie is a bitch, Julie simply agrees.<br /><br />Mostly it is the minute detail of cooking that attracted me.  As I watch Meryl learn to flip a quiche in a frying pan I was inspired.  When I witnesses Meryl and Amy actually debone a duck, I knew they were telling me that I could do this.  I am tempted to collect the ingredients and make some of the numerous sauces detailed in Child's book.  First, however, I have an Amazon friend, Aceto, who is indeed a noted chef.  I will ask his advice before I jump into the fray.  Aceto, is this possible for a klutz like me?<br /><br />I highly recommend \\"Julie and Julia\\".  This is not only an entertaining movie, I is a great learning experience.
B002VECMAE|2.0|I HAVE TO ADMIT, I HAD HIGH EXPECTATIONS WHEN I PURCHASED THE DVD.  BUT I AM AFRAID THAT I WAS DISAPPOINTED.  I HAVE ALWAYS LIKED GEORGE CLOONEY, BUT THIS PERFORMANCE WAS BELOW HIS NORMAL STANDARD.  I FOUND THE MOVIE SILLY.  I'M EITHER MISSING SOME SUTLE MESSAGE OR IT WAS A TOTAL WASTE OF MY TIME.  I AM HAVING A HARD TIME GIVING IT AWAY.  DIANA E.

0307454541|4.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a wonderful movie. The book, however, surpasses the movie. Engaging, character driven and wonderfully written to engage the reader, Sweden has lost a great natural resource, Stieg Larrson. He lives on in the complex lives of the characters he has developed as you get brought along with each discovery, not only of the mystery being followed, but of the mystery of the characters themselves. This is a book you should not miss reading.
B000IFQLSW|5.0|This is a great CD if you like blues. Kenny Wayne learned from the best, and it shows. Anyone would love to own this CD. Great music.
B001C4CI8U|5.0|I. Love. This. Show. It's got great (if somewhat unbelievable) science fiction scenarios, amazing characters, action, mystery, humor, suspense, a flitting romance and anything else anyone could ever want. It's a perfect tribute to the X Files. Anyone who claims to know and love sci-fi should watch this show. And the second season is just as good as the first.
B002ZRPQ5K|4.0|Each release from this group has been different from the one before.  This is no exception.  It's not a complete album, just an experiment.  The core of Keane's appeal is still there--great melodies, lyrics, and vocals.  My only complaint is the length of the disc, but it's an EP.  I look forward, as always, to their next release--I've been a huge fan since thier debut.  I will follow them, no matter what direction they go in, as will any true fan.
B0024RID6U|1.0|Too much stuff on Amazon is just pure false adverstising.  I purchased this remaster and received the 94 version.  Truly bogus!  In reality it's more of a pain to return than keep.  I've had the albums and now am out slowly converting everything over to disc.  I thought I was getting the 09 remaster.  Again watch yourself people.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|I finally got around to replacing my HD DVD version with the Blu Ray.  All the discs were there, including Disc 1.  Interesting differences between the HD DVD and BD editions:  The pop-up menus don't slide up and make that annoying \\"woosh\\" sound in the BD edition- they just appear with no sound.  Secondly, you don't have the ability to use bookmarks in the BD version.  And lastly, on the HD DVD edition if you paused the movie a little timeline would appear showing you were you are in the movie, that feature is not in the BD version.<br />These differences are, in my opinion, minor quibbles in what is one of the greatest home video releases of all time.  This belongs on the shelf of any movie lover.  A classic.
0446615641|4.0|All The Books Arrived In Fair Or Good Shape. They Arrived On Time.And All Of His Books Are Good Reading!
B0019N8P2W|5.0|I was a moderate fan of Daria when the show aired in the late 90's/early 2000's.  It wasn't that I didn't like the show (I actually liked it quite a bit), just remember it being a show I'd see from time to time and remember it being decent.  Funny, good writing, just simply entertaining.  When I heard it was coming out on DVD I didn't have to think twice.  The memories of watching the show were good ones, so I ordered it the day it came out (and ended up only having to pay 28 bucks-NEW-and this included shipping).  Well I can say after having watched the first few episodes of the Daria Series Collection that the show seems to have held up well.    I guess if I could knock anything it might be the video quality.  Grainy lines and bland reproduction are apparent in the episodes I've viewed, but this in no way takes away from the enjoyment of watching the episodes.  Maybe I'm just spoiled in today's age of Blu-Ray.  I'm not going to downgrade the DVD for not having the original music.  Number one, everyone knows this that would be interested in this DVD.  I wouldn't be telling you anything you didn't know.  Additionally, inside the case there's a small note explaining why it isn't there (costly licensing).  So nobody is trying to hide anything here.  Number two-It's not that big of a deal.  I'm frankly shocked everyone is so concerned about the original music being present.  It's not like this is Beavis and Butthead where the music played a much more regularly present central role to the plot/action of the episodes.  Personally, not being a person that remembered many of the episodes, the lack of original music so far has not taken away anything from my viewing experience.  Guess I'm not sure what everyone's big problem with this is?  If you like the music that much, go hop on ITunes???  Maybe buy some used CDs on Amazon???    In the end, if you remember liking/watching Daria, there's no reason not to pick this up.  It's affordable.  All the episodes (including the movies) are there.  The show has held up well.      On a side note, I'm uncertain how people could have been reviewing this specific DVD collection in February of this year.  It was released on May 12th (I believe) 2010.  Maybe that's the most upsetting thing about this product-The Amazon Reviews.  The point of a review is to review the product once you've used it, not to hype it or knock it, when the damn thing hasn't even been released.  I don't care if you've seen all the episodes or not, until you use the actual product in question-DON'T REVIEW IT ON AMAZON!!!!!!!!!!  It completely defeats the purpose of reviewing items.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|While I didn't get any of the Kool-Aid the other reviewers are drinking, I do think this is a solid album, and that rare album that gets better as it goes along.    During the first couple of songs I was strongly reminded of Old Crow Medicine Show and Avett Brothers - not that that's a bad thing, but that American rootsy sound  has been done, and better.  Round about Track 3 or 4 I started to hear a little British accent, and by the end I really felt drawn into the music.  Normally I don't get much into lyrics, but I do note when the lyricist takes the easy rhyme.  I'm happy to say these lyrics are good (though not stunning as many other reviewers have said).    This band just reminds me of others - lots of others.  I don't feel that they have their own distinctive sound, but they do show a lot of versatility.  It's definitely worthwhile to give their CD a listen, and I have a feeling the experience will improve with every listen.  Not many bands can make that claim.  Maybe I will fall totally in love with them eventually.  Right now I'm just surprised at the sheer volume of unabashed raves for this band.
0385339682|3.0|Grisham strikes again, but not as hard as usual. In this book, he just does not offer as much of a puzzle to be enjoyed by the reader as he usually does. The story does not really capture you, and as a result, leaves you wondering why you are trying to get through a book that really is not as good as it could have been. It just kind of drones on and on for a while before it gets to be the least bit interesting, but when it does it can draw you in. However, that is only the last forth of the book. Otherwise, it is very, very slow. If you are a fan, you can expect enjoy this book, but if you are not you might be bored. This may even lead you to question why you are reading this author, but you should try other titles before you jump to the conclusion that he is overhyped. Anyway, get it if you are a real Grisham fan, but try another title if you are not.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|A boy who can't afford to attend school has the drive and perspicacity to make a windmill from scraps and bring energy, light and hope to his home and village by reading books from the village's small library. His ability to better his situation and those around him with little more than the belief he can is truly uplifting.<br /><br />Kamkwamba brings you into his life, and as he, his family and everyone around him suffer, so do you. I felt the desperation caused by the famine just as I felt the exhilaration when he finally completed the windmill. He tirelessly continues on, facing one obstacle after another, and he brings hope that anyone can achieve anything if they try.<br /><br />Kamkwamba says it best: \\"I try, and I made it.\\"
0307474275|2.0|This book was hyped as some sort of innovation when it came out. It was acclaimed by many, but after reading it I thought all these people must have drunk the cool-aid. This was too dense to be enjoyable. I mean the first 15 pages were good, but then it just got plain tedious. And this is coming from someone who thinks textbooks are enjoyable to read. Then it just gets bogged down in Brown's mental paradise which is filled with some very odd images. I mean, really, a great conspiracy to keep all this covered up? Not likely. Anyway, I just thought this was boring and too long. I would have read Differential Equations or something else more accessible than this. Avoid this book!!!!
B002JVWR9U|5.0|I agreee with all of the awesome things the other reviewers have said. This is by far my favorite show ever! It is so much different than any other show i have ever watched and its going to be a long 4 months without :( By the way, the season finale was AMAZING! I was actually thinking that it was kinda dissapointing until the end. And i was seriously proved wrong. I really want to purchase this but I wanna know the release date if anyone knows. So yes, definitely reccomended!
B003AO1SVS|5.0|This is where it's at. A Black Keys masterpiece. Watch out - there is a reason this came out the same day \\"Exile\\" was reissued - they are both classics!
B001C46P2K|5.0|If you were always a fan of Emily Blunt, this movie will amplify your respect for her as a thespian.  She did a superb job portraying Victoria's transformation from a young, sheltered girl to an energetic royal determined to improve England's infrastructure.  Emily's scenes with Rupert Friend were a cinematic joy to watch from start to finish.
B003CIG7AE|1.0|Wow...i really regret spending money on this boring piece of work...dentist office music at best! Nothing inspiring here - Bridwell's voice is nice but the songs are bland and the lyrics are cliche. Not like the other two albums...don't waste your money. Cheesy 70s rock.
B002SQFZ68|4.0|am using an expensive 2.1 audiophile setup with my martin logans..    I need to crank up the volume on my top of the line denon receiver..  I know there is a lot of \\"content\\" on here..  but out of 300 concert dvds, I don't need to give it near this much juice...????      Dry County has always been one of my faves, great to get a live version  Keep the Faith f....ing rocks  In these arms    these 3 do it for me, wish I got these at Staples last month; the show was boring and the setlist sucked!!!    also does anyone notice there is no time or song counter on the bluray player; it just says play, no track number or time???
B001HN69AY|2.0|I don't know how to describe this movie except to say that it was vague, nonsensical and boring. The characters were far from endearing and the story was rediculous. I was terribly disappointed with the whole production. It seemed like it wanted to be something great but didn't know how to get there. Sad.
B0013N7AD8|5.0|For true Batman/Burton fans!  Movie PQ and AQ are vastly superior to the SD DVD releases, especially Batman and Batman Returns.  Recommended.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Any time a legend like Jack Nicholson plays a character, it's tough to follow in those footsteps, to match the performance of a master and legend.    Heath Ledger's performance as The Joker was so over-the-top amazing that it made me forget that Nicholson ever played the part.  I wasn't especially a fan of his until this movie, which I re-watch often.  If you haven't seen it (and why not?), it is worth watching simply for scenes in which The Joker holds court.  And he pretty much drives and dominates every scene he's in.    He made a good movie into a great, classic one.  Best superhero movie ever, hands-down.
B001DJLCPO|5.0|This movie is not for everybody-some might find the storyline simplistic (which it is), however, this is a film that young and old can be captivated by.  It's a Henson film with a different view of family life and relations, and the battle between the good and the bad inside one's self.  That being said, the BD transfer is absolutely Outstanding!  PQ & AQ are gorgeous, and truly capture the film maker's intent.  Very Highly Recommended!
B000P0J09C|5.0|This is a must see movie that's essentially broken in 2 parts. The first half of the film is about bootcamp under the cruel R. Lee Ermy. One of the marine trainees snaps, and it's just a great scene. This is right up there with Apocalypse Now.
B001EN71HC|5.0|PQ above average, AQ above average.  These movies are fun to watch, and they will never look better than this BD collection.  Highly recommended.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS SHOW, the second season was amazing, so many things you wanted to know is revealed and most loose ends are tied up. I bought the entire series on Itunes and my friends can tell you I have watched each episode around 10X and I still plan to buy the actual season two dvd for all the features like commentary and deleted scenes.  Honestly if you didn't watch the series on tv pick it up now, It's so worth the buy.   It has a great cast that is very talented, it has quirky joss humor and Eliza actually shines especially in the episodes her character isn't on an engagement.    Olivia Williams character shows an even more devious evil side and even deals with alcoholism and finds a way to come above it and become the leader in the fight against rossum.    Fran aka Topher plays the quirky science guy and this season he finds love has his heartbroken and he goes insane, can you ask for anything else to see in one season of a show I THINK NOT XD     Enver as victor really just blows you away when he plays topher a fellow cast member and does an amazing job even mimicking his voice and mannerism and plays the best serial killer psycho.    Dichen character Sierra gets her back story revealed and how an obsessive Doctor seen in season one makes her his personal doll and she gets her revenge and gets her personal power back    Alpha is awesome this season, he redeems himself after the omega episode and becomes funny yet devious and even reforms.    Eliza: Her acting in the second season is just amazing, she really shows her chops this season now that her character is self aware and becomes a real person outside of caroline. You even learn about caroline and she is a very likable character many were not sure from the first season because their was only minor tid bits.    The story moves fairly fast but it's a good pace and you get to see that amazing apocalyptic future from epitaph one and THE ATTIC IS REVEALED and it is as weird and creepy as I had hoped.  There is an entire episode that resides in the ominous attic and seems almost like a dark alice in wonderland.      Joss Whedon once again creates and amazing show that just is not advertised correctly. Fox made those commercials that told you nothing about this show so any didn't grasp what it was about so give it a chance You won't regret it.
B0016CCEU0|5.0|This was the book I had been looking for - it is one of six in a series of Jane Austens'work.  It is my favorite - the love story of Elizabeth Bennett and Mr. Darcy.  I would recommend this book to every woman to read - it transports you to a time of so much traditions, social manners and Miss Austen does an excellent job of explaining the ways of the English gentry at that time.  It is a wonderful love story and I am so happy that I found all six of the novels by Miss Austen in this series.
B002CVQAX6|5.0|This is one of the BEST \\"Freak You Out\\" movies I have ever seen.<br />Don't believe ANY comments to the contrary. No matter how many<br />times you may watch it, the impact NEVER FADES. Buy It !
B001WCN232|1.0|The only reason to buy this version is if you want to listen to \\"Star Star\\" with your preschool kids in the car.  Come to think of it, you'd probably be better off listening to the Wiggles.
0971407614|5.0|This book has great value.  With it's going price and the wealth of knowledge it provides, it's a steal.  This book is great for anybody who likes to bang out quick workouts in the morning before work and doesn't have the time to go to the gym, cleanup, and head to work in the morning.  Before this book, my at home exercises consisted of pushups and situps.  With this book, I can switch it up and arm myself with new exercises to work my body out.  It allows me to save at least an hour and a half alone of the setup and cleanup process of working out at the gym on a workday.  It's also great for us folks who travel and finding a well equipped gym is not always accessible.  This book belongs on anyone's bookshelf that is serious about changing their way of life and gives you the flexibility to stay on it when going to a gym is not always realistic.  With 3 kids and a full time job, this helped fill in the short gaps of time I have during the day and give the body what it needed.  I would recommend this book to anyone.    Dale
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Add me to the group of people saying \\"I never write reviews, but...\\" I'd never heard of Monae before today, but just a few hours later and I'm already one of her biggest fans. The video to \\"Tightrope\\" is amazing -- it's almost unfair that a woman with this voice and this much imagination could have those dance moves, too.    Even if this had been a mash-up of Cab Calloway, James Brown, and hip-hop, it would've been enjoyable. Adding the 70s glam rock/concept album format would make it clever. But this album is all over the place, way past what you might expect from the \\"R&B/Soul\\" category and the \\"Tightrope\\" single. Disco, psychedelic rock, bossa nova, Carpenters-sounding 70s AM pop, and tons of other genres I can't even identify.    This would be one of the best albums of the last 10 years even without the brilliantly goofy high concept; the robots and future cities just push it way over the top to genius.
B002ZRPQ5K|1.0|Seriously, if like me, you liked their two first albums, avoid this by all means. They aren't that band anymore.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Sure there is a lot of hype behind this album, and it is well deserved.  Everybody is not going to like everyone or every artist.  But for the listeners who are captured by Janelle's charisma and respect for art, you will be beyond pleased with this album.  The production is beyond stellar, live orchestra's and overtures that will leave you thunderstruck.  All the songs flow seamlessly into one another and the music, guitar riffs, break downs, and incredible tempo will make you want to catch the spirit and dance!  Janelle has a vivid imagination making her fictitious story of Cindy Mayweather relate-able to her part in saving the current music world and the creative hearts of music lovers.  The album plays like a movie and is well worth every second.  Janelle's vocals are so diverse and so sweet.  By the time \\"Say you'll Go\\" is ending with its Disney like outro you are about ready to shed a tear.  This album is too good for my review.  I hope everyone takes a chance on this album and supports good music!
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Since this is a Pixar film, we know the animation is going to be state of the art.  They invented the cutting edge when it comes to animation.  However, at the end of the day it's their warm, heartfelt stories that truly resonate with people.  And these aren't just stories for children.  These are stories for young and old alike.  These are stories for the child in us all.    Up is no acceptation.  Once again Pixar knocks it out of the park with this charming, touching family tale.  My son, wife, and I absolutely love this movie, their best to date in my opinion.    If you have a Blu-ray player, you owe it to yourself to buy this edition.  The picture is beyond amazing.  We are talking reference quality here.  If you don't have a Blu-ray player, do yourself a favor, buy one now and watch this film.  You can thank me later.    Those who refuse to watch animated films because they feel they are cartoons aimed solely at children are missing the boat.  I challenge you to watch the first 10 minutes.  If you're not truly moved and completely drawn into the story, call a doctor because something is wrong with you.    Up is easily the best picture of 2009, much better than either Avatar or The Hurt Locker.
B001LF4IA6|3.0|After  listening to most of this album I feel that it shifts gears way too many times. The songs range from falling in love with a checkout girl, to, the Obama campaign theme song,  to, the passing of the beloved Danny Federici, to, (maybe) Bruces guilty conscious of cheating on his wife, to, FINALLY, the movie, \\"The Wrestler.\\" I mean come on! The songs hold up, however, most of Springsteens  records over the years center on one theme. This record fails to do that. This (in my opinion) is the major flaw on the record. The song, \\"The Wrestler,\\" is (again, in my opinion) the most poignant song on the disc. Why? Because it deals with what Bruce does best, write about the human condition. Bruce's bread and butter is dealing with the dark side of life. The hopes and promises that never come to be.  That is what  made him. That is what he does best. When you listen to a song like \\"The Wrestler\\" and then crank, \\"Surpise, Surprise\\",if you have been following Springsteen for thirty years like I have you have to wonder, what is going on here?  I still believe that this guy has one more masterpiece left in him. He is too much of a talent to keep singing about checkout girls in supermarkets.
B0039TD7RC|1.0|Mick Jagger has been listening to hip hop too long, for it has crept into \\"Dancing In The Light\\" one of the songs that he has added new vocals to. I guess that because the song had no vacals and there for no melody, Mick just went in and sung what ever melody came to mind, which in this case was more of a hip hop rhythm than an actual melody. I don't know whether to laugh or cry.  In order to get this review on here I had to give it a rating of at least one star, however it should really be minus 5 stars.
B000H7J9R6|5.0|There were 5 great horror movies that came out around 2005, that didn't rely on blood 'n guts to scare you, just great chills that were so creepy you couldn't sleep after viewing - and most were remakes of Japanese classics: The Ring, The Grudge, Boogeyman, White Noise and Dark Water. The latter gives such a feeling of isolation you can't help but feel for the main character, I loved it. Many had pretty bad sequels, and it seems we've gone back to \\"hack 'n slash\\" films, unfortunately, (Saw VI?), but for a brief couple of years we were treated to quality scares... Rent or buy these 5 for a great time.<br /><br />P.S. One exception: Quarantine last year gave me the creeps without being too bloody (maybe a little graphic, but pulled back enough)...
0783240287|1.0|I had the VHS tape of this video and loved it, so I just recently purchased the DVD.  Not thinking there was any reason to do so, I WISH I had read the customer reviews, as many of them commented on how terrible the sound quality of this DVD is.  And I'm here to back them up.  I have tried watching this on both my surround sound system and the television alone, and in both cases, it's horrible.  Background singers and music are barely audible, but the narrator's part will blast out your ears if you turn up the volume to hear the music.  What makes this even more disappointing is that Amazon will not refund your money in full.
0446569895|4.0|Ozzy is without a doubt a crazy rocker, and this book details exactly that, from his early years until as recent as 2009, all the craziness he's put himself through. I enjoyed reading about his wildly bizarre antics, and his side of what really happened during his life, especially the infamous events like when he bit the head off of a bat at a concert. Ozzy has a wonderful sense of humor, and has a great knack at telling stories and basically making something serious turn out to be quite hilarious. However, at some point the actual subject matter, which was mainly him getting beyond screwed up on some sort of substance, became a bit boring. Of course I realize that was his life, and I don't believe any editing or anything else would have made the plain truth sound any different or less uninteresting, it's just the way it is. Not to say that this wasn't a fascinating, hilarious journey into the life of a man who worked his way from a poor little town in the UK, to becoming a mega rock star in his lifetime, because it is exactly that, and then some. Finally, potential readers should know that this book is obviously written almost verbatim from Ozzy's words, meaning there doesn't appear to be a lot of fancy editing going on, which is a mixed bag since, on the positive side, this is exactly how he thinks and talks, but then again, it's also filled with British slang and lots of \\"potty mouth\\" language...so if you're one who gets easily confused of offended, it's best to avoid reading this.
B000ZLFALI|4.0|I bought this DVD, which was advertised as \\"like new.\\"  I was disappointed to find it froze temporarily in two places, and I didn't feel that \\"like new\\" was an accurate description.  Since I've never experienced that on my machine before, I don't think it's the DVD player that is the problem.  I'm going to have to buy a \\"new\\" version, because it's my favorite movie, and I watch it often.
044656740X|4.0|Whether you model the author's actual approach to wealth or not, \\"Rich Dad\\" gives readers a very interesting and savvy way to approach your financial life.  As a college graduate in my mid-20's, I was not unfamiliar with the ideas presented by Kiyosaki, though reading his book was a great reminder and wake-up call! Most readers with even idle interest in personal finance will get through this book in one or two sittings.  Others, looking for \\"quick schemes\\" or \\"easy answers\\" will probably throw the book down midway in frustration.  The writing style is extremely simplistic and the author repeats himself a little excessively to be considered a 5-star book by my standards.  But all-in-all, its a valuable resource and excellent starting point for those interested in financial literacy!
0312370849|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It had an interesting story line and flowed between the Holocaust and present time well.  But because the author went back and forth in time, the book became very predictable, which made it not as fun to read.  It takes all the mystery and suspence out of the story.
B0035J6TAI|5.0|I decided to write this review after reading all the negative 1 star comments that people have been posting!!  First off,  if your really a true fan, you would understand why he made this album.  My first listen to it was that it was something different, and there was only a few songs that I actually enjoyed, but after listening to it more and more, I got to really enjoying this album.  Then he starts his small North American tour.  I attended the first Montreal show, and wow is all I had to say.  Seeing him perform this stuff was remarkable.  It sounded amazing!!  Now, I took music in school for years and attended many \\"classical\\" concerts, and as saying its not what I listen to at home, it is something that's enjoyable to watch if you enjoy great arrangements.  Peter did a great job on this album, and for those who are still dwelling on the past of this former Genesis front man.  LET IT GO!! He's matured since then and this really shows it!!  I'm a huge Genesis fan, Peter & Phil alike and enjoy both their solo careers and as much as it would be cool to see them get back together,  who cares.  They've all grown up since 1971 and if it happens, well it will, if not, oh well,  listen to the CD's and Vinyls!!    Specially for the tour,  listening to the orchestra perform with Peter some of his older songs was phenomenal.  They gave them such a revamp and refreshed look,  something someone had to witness.  All the people in that arena that night enjoyed it.  They are the true fans out there!!    This is a must listen album for ANY real and true Peter Gabriel fan, as a true fan will appreciate this album and its production content.    closing notes, for those who \\"prefer\\" a \\"real\\" PG album, wait a few years, I'm sure it'll happen!!
B003102JDM|2.0|Usually I dislike lazy comedies, over-hyped albatrosses like Avatar, and vehicles for the most over-rated actress of our generation, Renee Zellweger.  But occasionally, I dislike the critics' beloved sacred cows that may appeal to the intellect, but are, in the viewing, so unenjoyable an experience as to be nearly unwatchable.  And I think this perfectly describes A Serious Man.  I did like films like Adaptation and I Heart Huckabees, which nearly fall into this category but are enjoyable to watch, and thus leave one interested and engaged with the difficult themes.  After slogging through A Serious Man, I just turned it off and said, \\"Well, that was obnoxious.\\"  The film presents themes (accepting life vs. fighting it; absurdity, the lack of easy answers; and, bizarrely, the undead -- the Jewish dybbuk) but seems to have nothing to say about them (the dybbuk is introduced in the 10-minute non-sequitur first scene which takes place in Medieval Poland, but is not referred to again).    I'm not sure what the appeal of the characters is.  Almost every character, major and minor, is portrayed as annoying, neurotic, ugly, whiny, frail, obnoxious.  The film goes out of its way to portray its Jewish cast this way, gratuitously.  In one scene, for example, the protagonist is getting advice from his sister (I think), who only appears sitting on a park bench in this single scene and is shown, inexplicably, to have braces on her legs -- because God forbid she just be a normal person!  You might disagree that the film is anti-Semitic, but I think that the only reason you could make that argument is because the Coen Bros themselves are Jewish.  If it's not anti-Semitic, then it seems designed to make the viewer come away feeling sickeningly like an anti-Semite.    A lot of people are going to heap praise on this movie, but it's just another arthouse-type film that only sounds good on paper.  I give it two stars because it's obviously well-made, because the Coen Bros are artistseven when they suck, and because utter distaste for a movie is a better reaction to have than not caring at all.  At least there was something there to talk about, even if it didn't actually say anything.
B002LC2DQ4|3.0|I bought this item because it was an Amazon recommendation to do so when I was buying the Olympus Stylus Though 6020. When I tried placing this card into the camera, it didn't fit. I think this is the only model of the Olympus Stylus series that uses an SD card. The description should detail for which models it fits.  I have given this card to a relative and it works very good.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|First, perhaps the label (which released the DVD) intentionally left out the \\"guest\\" tracks in order to promote sales of the DVD. Maybe it isn't cricket, but it's been done before, and will be done again.    As to the quality of the recording and mix -- it sounds great on my Yamaha receiver and B&W bookshelf speakers -- hardly a high-end audiophile system, but good enough to get past the limitations of low end systems. So, if the mix sounds off, it just may be your equipment.    Finally, the performance is fantastic. Please allow an artist to grow over forty years, folks. I happen to like jazz and fusion, so the over-abundance of that approach doesn't bug me one bit. Besides, if you're a Jeff Beck fan, you've GOT to know the man likes to change it up: his entire career is one big metamorphosis!    Ignore the low reviews. If you're not into DVD audio, buy the CD. If you're into DVD audio, buy the DVD: they did a superb job capturing the show. I purchased the DVD first, then bought the CD because I couldn't get the version of iTunes I have to rip the soundtrack.
B00022TPTI|5.0|Black Sabbath, like the Beatles and Devo, was one of the few bands I liked when I was a little kid, before I actually got into music. I didn't have direct access to any of their records, but I did have a neighborhood buddy whose older brother would often torture us by locking us in his pitch dark bedroom with either of the first two Sabbath albums playing at full blast. This was terrifying at first, but after a while I must have developed a taste for it. Years later when I dove head first into music, at first it was Devo and new wave, and then I quickly moved on to punk and hardcore, which of course lead to thrash. Around the time I was in college, I began broadening my musical horizons a tad, and that was what lead me back to Sabbath. I started buying their albums chronologically, and I remember that when it was time for me to pick up 'Vol. 4', the record store clerk warned me \\"You might not like this one, it's pretty weird. It's kinda their weirdest record. It's not like the first three.\\" I'd heard other people say similar things about it, and I still do once in a while. I've never understood what the hell these people are on about. Is Vol. 4 identical to the first three records? No. (As if the the first three records are identical to each other in the first place...) It does have bits of experimentation here and there. (As if Master of Reality's tracks Orchid and Embryo weren't weird and experimental...) Overall, relative to the big picture of Sabbath's entire body of work, I think it's more similar to the first three records than it is different. It showcases Iommi's classic sludgey guitar sound and a lot of typically simple, heavy, catchy riffs. The occasional experimentation doesn't even come close to outweighing these elements. Maybe when it was released in 1972 and there was nothing to compare it to other than the previous albums, it was more shocking and developed a reputation for being \\"a weird album\\" and that reputation carries on. But if you listen to all of Sabbath's records in chronological order, I think it's obvious that Vol. 4 fits right in there next to the first three albums. Its follow-up 'Sabbath Bloody Sabbath', to me that was the first truly \\"weird\\" Sabbath album that took a sharp left turn away from the early sound. (Which is not to say it's not an amazingly great album... it is most definitely that.)<br /><br />All of that aside, this is one of my favorite Sabbath albums. If I named all of the songs on it that I love, it would practically be the entire track list. Supernaut is the absolute cream of the crop.

B003AO1SVS|3.0|Embarrassingly, my review is the same as a lot of others:  If you came to The Black Keys through their 1st three albums, you'll be underwhelmed by this.  If you came in through Attack & Release, you'll probably really like it.  I came in through the early stuff.  Some of the tracks (Next Girl, Sinister Kid, Black Mud) would be GREAT change of pace cuts on something like The Big Come Up, but (in my humble opinion) they just don't stand out on this set.  I guess my feeling is that The Black Keys just don't have strong enough lyrics to be this mellow; they have to provide raw emotional power to be truly successful.  I applaud their attempts to branch out and experiment, but I like their full tilt music much better.
B0039TD7RC|3.0|38 years ago, the Rolling Stones released Exile On Main Street, perhaps the finest pure rock 'n roll record ever recorded. Exile moves because of its sound. Because of Charlie's drums. Because of Bill's, Mick T.'s and Keith's bass parts. Because of Mick T's and Keith's guitars. Because of Bobby Keys's sax. Because of Jim Price's horns. And, of course, because of Mick's vocals. But the primary value of Mick's vocals are they are the vehicle for the melodies. So, while the meaning of the lyrics are pretty much beside the point, the sound of the lyrics are pretty much the whole point. For this reason, Mick's vocals are just another instrument to be mixed in with the other instruments. This is why they weren't \\"up front\\" when Exile was initially released on May 12, 1972; because what mattered was the sound of the melodies and the sound of Mick's voice mixed in with the other instruments.    The CD release of Exile changes this mixture by making use of audio compression (and by no means is it the most blatant, off-putting, use of compression I have heard), to bring Mick's vocals somewhat more to the forefront. However, this bringing of Mick's vocals more to the front comes at the expense to the overall sound of Exile we have become familiar with and was the original intent of Mick and Keith. So, if what is important to you is the sound of Exile, and trying to get a better version of Exile than the Virgin issue from, I believe 1993, I cannot recommend this CD.    On the other hand, the vinyl re-issue, on super quiet 180 gr. vinyl, is what you want if you want the best available version of Exile not from a secondary source.  The vinyl keeps faith to the original because, while it has the advantage of the added clarity found on the CD remastering, it doesn't have the compression. The lack of compression keeps the balance of the sound unchanged. This added clarity, but lack of compression, means there is more muscle to Charlie's drums. There is more delicacy to his stick work. Mick T's slide on Stop Breaking Down is luscious. The horns are more defined as are the vocal harmonies.    However, following reading a review of Exile by Michael Fremer, I now have to agree with him to the extent that he writes that neither these new issues are as good as either Bob Ludwig's 1993 CD or the original vinyl.  Where I disagree with him is I do not feel the new vinyl is quite as bad as he seems to think, and most certainly if one doesn't have the money to purchase Ludwig's '94 CD or the original vinyl, this vinyl remains the best least expensive option.    P.S.  Anybody who wishes to actually see an example of the extent of the compression done to Exile, should go to RoboGoon's Amazon profile, [...], and click on images.  He has compared the song Happy from a previous edition of Exile to the current edition.  The compression is very obvious. Thanks, RG!
B0000DDAU9|4.0|Remission is the kind of album that grows on you over the course of several spins. After discovering Mastodon through Crack the Skye (which is a great album for very different reasons), my first impression of Remission was that it was irritating. Only through the second and third spins of the disc did I begin to appreciate the artistry and melody underlying the brutal assault on the senses. Rhythms are complex, and one aspect of this album that stands out for me over Mastodon's later albums is the intensity of the drumming. This may be because the song melodies grab me less immediately on Remission than they do on, say, Blood Mountain, so the aggressive but artistic rhythms come to the foreground. These guys didn't quite \\"come of age\\" until Leviathan, but in an era that saw the extinguishing of the Pantera flame, and the emergence of mediocre-core (Lamb of God), Mastodon's Remission heralded the return of metal you can really believe in--and they only got better after that.
0375714669|4.0|After reading the first Persepolis, I could not help but read the second. I wanted more about Marj and her family and the sequel gave me just that. In this book, we meet up with Marj in Austria where she has been sent by her parents in order to keep her safe and away from Iran. She is supposed to be living with a family friend and attending school. However, the family friend cannot afford to keep Marj in their small apartment and so she is sent to a convent. Her independence and rebellious spirit eventually forces her to leave and find residence in an apartment which also ends poorly. She falls in love but is betrayed which causes her to turn to drugs and life on the streets. Eventually, she returns to Iran where she finally feels at home but even those warm feelings do not last in the post-war Iran.    While the first Persepolis is about Marj's developing identity as an Iranian during the revolution, this installment centers on Marj's personal growth and the friction it causes with her Iranian background. She must endure extremely painful relationships in order to find a way to love herself and her homeland though both are broken (and at times seem to be beyond repair).
0385523386|5.0|Piper Kerman's protrayal of her life from the moment she get indicted to the time she gets out in Chicago is a can't put down book.  Piper I agonized with you the five years up until the sentencing.  Been there.  Done that. Horrible.   I finished it in a few days.  It is a quite accurate account of all of the dehumanizing experiences and injustices a person has to put up when locked up. Regardless of whether you are guilty or not.  The prisons are ruled by alot of dysfunctional cruel people.   Our prison system is a business for the government.  Thank God, mandatory minimums no longer exist and judges have the option to sentence the people in alternative ways.  Having had a brother down with the Feds for many years this is exactly how it was whenever we visited him. Piper was in a minimum securiy prison.  The other prisons are much harsher.  I love the stories of the prison cooking and most of all the lovely friendships that Piper developed with women from all walks of life.  There is no rehabilitation and no chance of an even decent basic education in prison. Most of the people who are there have no choice but to go back to the way of life they once knew.  No education and armed with the ridiculous classes the Federal Prison made the people take before leaving, these women have no real hope, unless they have a supportive family like Piper's, and let's face it many of them don't.  Piper's book was funny, self-deprecating and empathetic to the common suffering of all her homie's in Danbury. I enjoyed her journey of growth and acceptance of her own role in her dilema.  She also stayed in shape by running and doing yoga and useful by working and learning a new trade (sort of).  In short a model prisoner.  I,like some of your other readers would have loved to read an epilogue about how you adjusted to life on the outside and how some of did your friends, who were released did after the went to the halfway house and then home. It is hard to find a job with a felony in this country.  Piper you are one lucky woman ( I am sure you know that) and so is your husband Larry for having you!
0812976525|4.0|The plot of Thank You For Smoking revolves around Nick Naylor and his work at the Academy for Tobacco Studies in Washington D.C. Basically, he is the spokesperson for the company and spends the majority of his time defending cigarettes and trying to debunk the \\"myth\\" that cigarettes are bad for people. Though the majority of people would find this job to be immoral, Nick is able to pull it off splendidly to the point that it appears he actually believes the lies that he tells the public. Nick is as alienated in his personal life as he makes himself in his professional life. He is divorced and though he helps to support his ex-wife and son, he has little to do with either. The majority of his support comes from the self-proclaimed \\"Merchants of Death\\", also known as the Mod Squad, which is made up of Nick and his two closest friends one of whom is a lobbyist for the alcohol industry and the other is a pro-gun lobbyist. Nick's boss and co-workers are even less helpful in giving him a moral balance to his character. BR, Nick's boss, is driven solely by money and power and has no qualms about casting employees aside if they refuse to help him in either of these ventures. Even more dubious is Jeanette who is BR's office love interest and has had her eye on Nick's job. Though the characters are interesting in themselves, the action in the novel really begins when Nick is brought on the Larry King show where a caller threatens Nick's life.    Overall, this is a great novel! It has everything that an enthralling tale should: sex, lies, deceit, and redemption. A lot of the humor is tongue and cheek and the majority of the dialog is sarcastic. All of the characters are cynical and do not hide their prejudices which leads to some hilarious situations. Most of all, I loved the characters. I thought that Buckley did in excellent job in making almost every character seem to be without a conscience and yet the reader is encouraged to root for \\"the enemy\\".    Less than 12 hours after I finished this novel, I ran out and rented the movie. Though they share the same title and some of the same plot points, the novel and movie are completely different. In order to make the movie stay within in an hour and a half, the director/screenwriter took out a main character who was crucial to the novel. In doing so, the film has a completely different feel than the movie. The moral of the book is to basically watch one's back because a friend or co-worker could be your greatest enemy. However, the moral of the movie is that you should never tell anything to a reporter even if you are sleeping with her and she seems sweet. In other words, the enemy is from the outside. Due to this, the ending of the novel and that of the film are almost exact opposite of each other. While the film eliminated a pivotal co-worker character, it added Nick's son. Though the scenes between father and son were humorous, I don't believe that it added anything to the movie. In contrast, the book only mentions Nick's son once or twice which further shows Nick's alienation from his family and any kind of love. Lastly, the novel puts a great emphasis on Nick's relationship with the owner of the Academy of Tobacco Studies (known as the Captain). It is this relationship that gives Nick any hope for the future and the Captain acts as Nick's only ally. Yet in the movie, the profoundness of this relationship is stripped down. Overall, I think that the movie and the book are wonderful! I fully enjoyed both. I have to say that I might have even enjoyed the movie a bit more than the book (but the jury is still out on that). However, they are so different that they must be viewed as entirely different entities that merely share the same name.
B002L5GQGY|3.0|I hate to be the spoiler here, but by his own admission in the yakety part of this disc, Joe thinks he might be a little ADD. He left out affected. Anyone who tells you, at the age of 32, that they have been working for 20 years to get to the Albert Hall is a ponce who should have hailed a cab and spared the rest of us the pretension. You were 12, you donkey. On top of that he sings like he's auditioning for Simon Cowell.    Now that I have your attention, it comes down to this: he has dexterity to die for and an encycopaedic knowledge of his fingerboard, but his own compositions, at least the way he sings them, lack depth and soul. He hits all the notes letter perfect, and that's the problem. It's absolutely all technique. Again, by his own admission, he doesn't have the grasp of spacing - when to play and when not. In fact, having listened to this and Black Rock, I'm convinced he abhores a pause, and his leitmotif seems to be why play one note that says it all when at least 100 redundant ones can be shoved in the same bar. His playing reminds me of a player piano hooked up to supercharged turbine. Paul Weller correctly observed that you wouldn't even entertain the thought of walking onstage unless you had an oversized ego that screamed constantly for attention. The best effect a humility. The rest can be insufferable. My guess is this guy was a little monster from the jump and there's no getting the cow back in the barn at this point. Part of it for me is that it all sounds the same. All of it. There's no doubting his technical mastery and he can mimic the blues, but it IS mimicry. I think he ought to hire someone who could more authentically deliver the idiom, someone from Chicago or Northern Mississippi or the Louisiana delta, for example. Upstate suburban NY just doesn't have that same mojo going for it. The band is technically impressive as well, but I can't help feeling like I'm at David Letterman's show.    At best, this is blue eyed blues, and like blue eyed soul, the calories are empty and the vanilla turns cloying. If you have trouble getting the difference, it's there in the cameos with Clapton and Paul Jones. Jones was lead singer and harmonica player for the original Manfredd Mann, a band that was way better at the blues than any of their Brit invasion contemporaries. That was due to the soul in Jones' voice and his command of the harp. He too had modelled his approach after veterans from the fields of the US, but working class Brits in the early Sixties found a lot in common with the pain and suffering and lack of prospects post WW2 as did many of those who shaped post war blues. They had a rigid class system instead of slavery, but they got the point. Not sure if Joe really is the measure of say, Asie Payton. You'll have to look him up on your own. In fact, Joe should look him up on his own and lay off the patently absurd remarks he makes about his own \\"struggles.\\" Oy. Clapton is generous and has a sense of pacing and when not to play that you'd wish Bonamossa might learn from as well, but no, here comes the flood.    Mind you, I have the same complaints with Tommy Emmanuel. There's no off button.     Anyway, usually when I'm scratching my head in disbelief, it's a sure thing the artist in question will be successful beyond expectations. Good for him if that's the case. Given the choice of free front row seats to Bonamossa, or paying an arm and a leg to see Sonny Landreth from the back of the theatre, I'll live with the limp.
037571457X|4.0|After rave reviews, a blockbuster movie, and a sequel there is very little that can be said about Persepolis that hasn't already been stated. Still, I must join the cacophony of voices who have given this graphic memoir glowing reviews. As many already know, the story is about Marj (the author) who is a young girl living in Iran when the revolution begins. Her family is liberal and made up of very revolutionary thinkers, which puts them in great danger. As a ten year old, Marj watches as various members of her family are imprisoned and others are executed for their beliefs. Due to her young age, Marj gets caught up in the revolutionary sentiments that are all around her. However, she is unaware of the hazards of resisting authority and attending demonstrations that counter the government. Though her parents cultivate her passion and independence, they know that they cannot keep her safe in their homeland.    At times this memoir is troubling and frightening, yet it always remains tender and thoughtful. Despite the fact that this book is about war and oppression, it is not violent and none of the illustrations are explicit. The importance of family and close friends are lessons that readers of any age can enjoy and learn from. Perhaps the best aspect of this novel is that the reader does not need to have any knowledge of the Iranian revolution in order to understand the plot. It is also important to note that it is not your typical clichéd \\"coming of age\\" tale in which a young adult goes through a sexual awakening and suddenly sees his/her parents as real people and therefore is released from childhood. Instead, this is a true tale of maturation in which the main character finds herself and her own voice despite the rampant oppression around her. She grows up not because she finds love and has her heart broken but because she learns the true importance of family and freedom.
B001CC7PKS|1.0|Honestly, I don't think that there was a single person in the production or studio that was not completely drunk or high on cocaine. Compare this film with any other Marvel film (Except Punisher w/Tom Jane) That was crap too! Stan Lee is getting older and there seems to be a necessity to pump out as many of the comics with little or no disregard to the true and factual story-lines. This film was put together with names vs. characters. Ben, Jen, and Michael were all the hype to watch this film. Had this movie been released in the 80's or 90's I would have cried at the disgrace, but seeing as how anyone who owns anything worth any substance sells it like a Prostitute, I am not surprised. Watch this movie with ear plugs and a blind fold while tripping on acid, then, and only then will this movie not want you to hate everything Marvel stands for. Enjoy!!
006621131X|4.0|It took me over in hour to decide to by this book and even after I brought it home I was worried that I would be disappointed. I have read other memoirs written by artists and singers and they all came off as narcissistic which led me to dislike them as artists and people. When I bought Just Kids, I thought that it would be different because I am ambivalent towards both Patti Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe. I think that this was the key to my not only enjoying the memoir but adoring it!!    The story is very simple: two friends decide to live and sacrifice themselves for each other and their dreams. Smith is in dire straights when she decides to move to Brooklyn and become an artist. She spends her nights sleeping in parks and her days wandering the streets looking for a job or food. One night she is on a date with a man when he becomes violent and she fears that he will rape her. The two are walking in a park when she sees Mapplethorpe sitting on a bench and asks him to pose as her boyfriend in hopes that it will scare off her date. Smith's plan works so well that she feels indebted to Mapplethorpe. The two go their separate ways only to find each other again through mutual friends. After their second meeting, they know that it is fate that they had met and soon they begin a relationship. Both are 21, naive, and working through their own ghosts. What begins as a sexual relationship becomes a symbiotic friendship from which the two promise to never leave. Though they move from place to place and Smith scrambles to make money for the two of them, they never lose sight of their dream to become artists. But Mapplethorpe's demons plague him so terribly that it pushes his work, morals, and friendship with Smith to the breaking point.    In a time when everyone and their dog is writing memoirs, it is hard to separate the wheat from the chafe. But Smith does it! Her writing and the structure of the memoir should be heralded for future writers in this genre. Personally, I was hooked from the first paragraph. I found her descriptions to be exceptionally well written, clear, and vivid. Unlike other memoirists, Smith does not shy away from the details that do not show her in the best light. Yet, at the same time, she does not dwell on her poor choices and sink into self pity. This is not a story about her life but about her love for her best friend.    Overall, Just Kids is a eulogy for Smith's best friend for whom she sacrificed everything with no regrets. It is a beautiful story that is tender and heart-wrenching. Though Smith and Mapplethorpe did become famous, it is not a memoir of the rich and famous; it's a tale of two down and out youths who found each other and lived for each other. It didn't make me want to rush out and buy her CDs or prints of his photographs, but that isn't the purpose of the memoir and for that I am very grateful! For now, it's one of by favorite books on 2010 and certainly one of my favorite memoirs of all time.
B0039ZF8D2|5.0|First, the cd comes with a poster, with that said lets get into the music.<br />What some people said about each track is basically true, there's up and mellow tracks that has great hooks on each of them. To me there's are no fillers, each one fits perfectly, I may not know what Daiman always says without reading the lyricts but he still sounds good none the less. I may not have gotten my second cd at the store (will get it later) but at less I got this. Please check out the cd and if like also please buy, a really good album.
0812973992|4.0|At first glance (or read) this book seems to be a collection of short stories that take place in New York City around the time that a tightrope walker walked across a rope between the Twin Towers as they were being built in the 1970s. However, the reader soon realizes that these stories are intertwined and are beautifully woven together into one overlying story told in a cacophony of voices.    McCann has chosen New York City as the setting for this novel and the diverse peoples of the city are his characters. His first character is Corrie who was originally from Ireland but moved to America and has taken up residence in the projects of the Bronx where he helps the elderly and prostitutes alike. The next series of stories involve a group of women who have lost son's in the Vietnam War. Lastly, are a couple of stories involving a young married couple who have chosen to abandon their reckless drug-riddled life and start anew in the countryside. Interspersed between these stories are vignettes about the tightrope walker and his great mission to cross between the Twin Towers. When tragedy strikes, these independent series of stories come together into one powerful overriding tale.    This is by far one of my favorite books of 2009. Each story is written beautifully and can easily stand on its own. Yet the connection between all of the stories brings together so many different voices and narrators that the overall story is overwhelmingly powerful. McCann's descriptions of poverty, grief, love, and compassion can not go with praise. Though he is originally from Ireland, he is able to tell of life in New York City better than most actual residents would be able.
B002VPE1B6|5.0|I saw this movie in the theaters in 3-D and loved it.  When the pre-sale notice came out for the Blu-Ray disc, I immediately signed up for it... and I don't have a Blu-Ray disc player yet!  The DVD is almost as spectacular and I can't wait until I can get my Blu-Ray player so I can watch that.      Kid warning: The violent, intense battle scenes and pervasive mature language might make this unsuitable for some kids.  My 10 year old watched it and was okay with it.  A younger child might have trouble with it.
B001V9VE4A|3.0|This is a tale about woman who works with her father in an antiquarian book store until she has sent a letter from a famous English writer asking the woman to write the writer's autobiography. The writer, Vera Winter, is an elusive woman who has hidden her personal life and history from her thousands and thousands of fans. However, Winter is now terminally ill and wants to have her entire story told. Winter's story is intertwined with that of the woman writing the biography and the two stories expose the hidden truths, in both of their lives, that have laid dormant for decades. Issues surrounding illegitimate children, incestuous desires, \\"twinness\\", and other gothic elements are woven into these parallel plots.    It is written within the Gothic tradition with overly rich writing that is reminiscent of Jane Eyre or Wuthering Heights (if even includes the burning down of a house!). While the writing and word choice is extremely discriminating and resonates throughout the pages, the characters fall flat and uninteresting. The most interesting characters in the story are only present in the first fourth of the novel. For the rest of the story, the characters are stereotypical and the plot turns can be seen a hundred pages away. While many reviews praised the novel for being reminiscent of the classic Gothic tales, I found that the book had more or less stolen the Gothic elements from other tales and had not developed them into the author's own story or craft.    In regards to the audiobook, I found the narrators to be exceptional. Though the story was dull and quickly became boring, it was the narrators who kept me listening. Their voices were enchanting and their reading of the story added more to the book than the actual text. However, not even the narrators could save me from the disappointment I felt when I reached the cliched ending. Overall, if you love Gothic fiction, you may be interested to read this book for the language and the allusions to Gothic classics.Yet, if you are looking for something comparable to Jane Eyre or other captivating classics, you have more luck just rereading the classics.
B002Y4Z4UQ|3.0|Get It Together marks a decided shift in the band's sound. Gone are the soulful ballads and r&b rhythms and entering are thumping disco beats and heavy dance sounds. The title track fires the opening salvo, but it is the propulsive \\"Hum Along & Dance\\" that shows off their new sound. It is a dance floor classic and its hypnotic beat drives you to the dance floor. \\"Dancing Machine\\" appears in a different version that the hit song and the band made a good decision to remix it. Get It Together started bringing a sound that young Michael would cultivate for the rest of the 70's.
0385341008|3.0|After reading numerous reviews about how exceptional this book is, I knew that I had to read it! This is another example of a book that though it created great hype and a flood of good reviews, I felt that it was lacking.<br /><br />The plot is pretty simple and revolves around the lives of people on the island of Guernsey which is one of the islands in the English Channel. The reader is introduced to these charming people by Juliet Ashton who became famous during WWII by writing a column in the British newspapers. She wrote one book that was given such acclaim that her editor demanded that she write another. However, Ashton has writer's block and isn't sure that she can make another moving book. Fortunately, she receives a letter from Dawsey Adams who has stumbled upon a book of poems by Charles Lamb and wants more information on the poet. Adams mentions that he was introduced to Lamb's work at the local book club called the Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society. Ashton becomes incredibly interested in this society and being a correspondence relationship with Adams and other members of the literary group. Immediately, she feels a pull to the island and its residents. When Ashton is told how Guernsy was occupied by the Nazis during WWII, she decides to visit the island and meet these resilient people. The secrets that she reveals and personalities that she encounters make the novel a delightful read.<br /><br />The novel is told entirely through letters which is an interesting technique but often takes a bit getting used to. The characters are charming though not dynamic and most times predictable. The story was enjoyable and quaint but not deep or remarkably memorable. The most interesting aspect of the book is the boom of publicity that has preceded and continues to follow this novel. Possibly one of the reasons why it created such a sensation is because the author died before the book was even published. Mary Ann Shaffer died the February before her book made it onto shelves. All editing and changes made to the novel were done by Shaffer's niece Annie Barrows. Many readers of the novel have become so entranced with it that they have created a Google map with pin points to mark certain areas that are described in the book. Besides the island of Guernsy, all other places on the island are fictitious. Yet, readers have used descriptions in the book to locate where certain events might have occurred. These events are marked and the passages in which they are described are tagged on the left.<br /><br />I believe that literary connoisseurs should read this novel because it is going to be discussed for years to come. Book clubs have already devoured it in such enormous quantities that the novel has skyrocketed to best-seller status across the country. The sensation that this book created is reason enough to pick up a copy. However, do not expect it to be of the caliber of great and lasting fiction. (lves.

1932100385|5.0|\\"The China Study\\" is a clear statement of profound scientific truth.  This book potentially could save the USA alone trillions of dollars in health care costs per year - not to mention the hundreds of billions wastefully spent by consumers on fraudulent or misconceived and misrepresented health promises.  This book extends and improves the quality of lives.  I have never read any non-fiction that was more profound.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|It's good to be reminded that individuals can truly make a difference when they are in relationship with a community of like-minded people. Amazing Grace highlights the wonder of discovering grace to change in tumultuous times and serves to remind us that love always prevails. Love is indeed a more powerful force than culture or tradition or money and in the character of Wilberforce we find a man who can settle for nothing less than true love even if it cost him his own life. Though he never dies physically in the movie he does die to himself and is born again to live for something much bigger than himself, something we all reap benefits from today.
B000VSAEYI|4.0|This product is serving us well!  I ordered it on a whim b/c it was at a great price, and the hot summer was looming during some unseasonally hot days in April.  My only complaint would be the lack of a pump.  I could have sworn the ad mentioned an included pump, but after further review, I must have been seeing things.  I went against the manufacturers warnings and used my compressor.  Even with a pump, there is no way I would have blown this thing up by hand.  Just be mindful of what you are doing if you use a compressor and you'll be fine.    Enough whinning, let's talk about the pool!  Our daughter is 2 1/2 and loves it.  The sprinkler gets to be too much for her, but it is optional, so we just turn it off when she doesn;t like it.  She loves to \\"swim\\" all around (swimming means crawling on hands and knees!) and the slide is a fun side dish.  It is not the main course and I wouldn't recommend buying it just for that.        As for durability, that remains to be seen.  So far so good, and I get a sense it is well made, and the materials feel strong.  We had some strong winds the last few days, and the thing got blown around the yard a bit when it was empty.  It took the punishment just fine.  If it survives the summer, it pays for itself as far as I'm concerned.      For the price, and free shipping, it gets a big thumb's up from me!
B002TYZKIM|5.0|Saw it at the movies and love seeing it over and over again.  He was a genius.  We lost a unique individual.  This DVD brings chills to me each time I view it.  We do  miss you Michael.  I know HEAVEN is enjoying your pure creative heart!
B000P12LWY|4.0|Ok, so this series definitely takes liberties with history, but it is still wonderful and fun to watch.

B002ZFQD0E|5.0|Buy this.  See her live.  Then see her live again.    I saw her Joe's Pub shows in April in NYC.  Seeing these songs performed live was a completely completely different experience than hearing them recorded.    Dance or Die had such an urgency to her frantic rapping - while surrounded by hooded capes.    Wondaland was a party I want to go back to - complete with silly string, swords, woo hoo-ing, dancing on tables and lots and lots of sweat.    See this woman live.  Let this disc be your invitation.  Watch her resurrect James Brown, Sun Ra, Debussy, Disney and anything else that possesses her on any given night.    I am thankful we still have performers like this.
1582701709|1.0|I cannot but agree with a recent review by Carol Travis in the TLS that the author's SECRET is <that if you are poor, unhappy or jobless, the fault lies not in your stars or your circumstances but in your thoughts>.  To all those who gave this book a positive review, I recommend Barbara Ehrenreich's recent book titled Bright-Sided: How the relentless promotion of positive thinking has undermined America.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I have read some of the other reviews and I will just say to each their own.  I read so I can have a little me time and this book (and the rest of the series) was great.      I am not an English major so I cannot contribute to whether or not Stephenie Meyer is a good writer.  But the book for me was great.  I was a little surprised about Nessie, but that didn't make me want to stop reading. I enjoyed the ending even though it didn't contain a big fight scene.  I liked Bella's talent and it fit along with the story. I've read this book at least 4 times already and I'm in the process of reading it again.      As for vampires, there are no rules on vampires.  They don't exist in the real world.  Anyone can create a book about what they think vampires are, I've read books where vampires aren't even dead, just infected with a virus, or one where they are injected with tiny little robots.  If Stephenie Meyer wants to say vampires sparkle in the sunlight then so be it, it is her book. You either like the book or you don't.
B001CXWWBE|5.0|I bought two of these because they are on the HCL for VMware ESXi 4.  I built a box to run ESXi and needed more network cards in the system, they work great!    Inexpensive for gigabit performance and ESX compatability!
B002W5UVSM|2.0|Just finished this so-called masterpiece and found it to be an average read at best.  Yes, there were parts that made me chuckle, but they ran about even with those that bored me enough to fast forward through some sections. I leave this book without keeping a memory of even one likeable character.<br />I'm glad for those readers who found this book to be so enthralling. I'm glad we all don't have the same likes and opinions or it would make for a very dull world.
B0039SFKSW|5.0|There is so much to love about this CD where do I start?  First of all you have four masters yet nothing is overplayed and the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts.  The songs are catchy, mostly upbeat with hooks galore.  The vocals are rich and thick and everthing is layered and textured nicely.  This CD  reminds me of the great songwriters of the 60's and 70's.  Beautiful chord progressions and changes, big harmonies and creative arrangements.       Hey, I just realized that I've been listening to this CD exclusively for the last four days.  I bet I've run though it 15 times but when I try to go to something else nothing sounds as good to me so I just start it over.  I'm sure it will subside soon but just case does anyone know of a support group for this kind of thing?
B002BB9BL0|5.0|I was never a fan of the X-Men comic books, but X-Men is probably the best action hero/comic book movie out there. Unlike many other such movies, such as Fantastic Four [Blu-ray], which are simply an excuse to have a bunch of action scenes and special effects, X-Men actually has a well-developed plot, good acting, as well as impressive special effects. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan as the two main mutants make the movie, are fantastic add emotional depth, but X-Men also includes a strong supporting cast, including Hugh Jackman and Hallie Berri. Overall, I was very pleasantly surprised by X-Men. Definitely worth checking out, even if you're not usually into this type of movie.

B00004XOWM|3.0|You can't totally hate this CD.  Wes and the gang know how to make catchy guitar driven songs that are quite good.  But when you put Durst's crybaby wanna-be rapper voice over it, its almost unbearable.  If only this CD was available in instrumental form, it would totally rock.  Durst though is pretty much the worst lyricist of all time.  You would think a guy that was vice president of a record company and had hit pay dirt with \\"Significant Other\\" while hanging and banging at the Playboy Mansion every weekend would have paid someone to write something that wouldn't make you feel embarrassed about listening to this in front of others...but he didn't and thus the latter.  Worst being not how horrible these lyrics are, but how much Durst brags about how good his lyrics are and his \\"hella mic skills\\"...what Fred Durst does this guy know, everybody that has ever heard that line has laughed their ass off.  Face it Fred...you suck.  Some songs are so bad I wonder how much time he actually spent contriving the lyrics.  Life in the Fast Lane...what like 5 minutes...a once over?  \\"OK that's good enough, lets record. I have a bunny to bang at Hef's!\\"  Its seriously that bad, but I do recommend this CD for the music...alone.  Wes is very cleaver, he doesn't fall into the trap so many other musicians do in doing too much and getting too complicated (see Slipknot, Everclear, etc) to where they lose the semblance of why people liked them in the first place.  He keeps is simple, but still someone witty, not overly complicated in execution.  If Fred would've shut his ego driven mouth for a few minutes it would've been nice.  This album pretty much killed the band.  They were seen as sellouts.  Thanks allot Fred...btw you're fat and I have seen your \\"movie\\" and you are pretty pathetic, I thought you were this pimp...at least on here thats what you claim.  The best track on the whole CD was My Way and that was mild at best, musically the whole thing is good...but thats if you can ignore Durst...NOT EASY.  I am glad you are gone.  P.S. Rollin sucked.
