B00005JMJ4|3.0|I thought that the premise was great, two people lonely in a strange land befriend each other. The photography and the soundtrack were used to good effect. Overall I thought the movie was moody and meloncholy...which it should have been. Character development was where I thought the film lacked. I got the feeling that we just touched the surface of these two instead of getting a good understanding of them. I left the theater thinking that there was still more that I wanted to know. It was far batter than your average movie (which does not speak too well for our choices in movies) so I gave it three stars.
B000002LRX|5.0|This album blew me away! Mike Pattons amazing vocal abilities really make this CD.
B00009V7P8|5.0|this is a really awesome album. its very smooth and the transitions are almost unnoticable. its really cool if your into this kind of thing
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw is currently touring in support of Barenaked Ladies, but I am of the opinion it should be the other way around.  This album is one on which I skip no tracks...I just can't, because there are no bad songs.  Each song, all written by Gavin, is a gem.  Gavin also plays all the piano and keyboard parts. There's a lot of talent in this man that isn't making it through to mainstream radio.<br />Here is my take on the tracks, one at a time:<br />FOLLOW THROUGH:  The lead single, and also the one that got some airplay.  This is a dynamic song that sounds mostly acoustic until the chorus, when the electrics kick in.  The bridge is gorgeous, with lots of guitar slides.  Great rhythm and wonderful vocals.<br />CHARIOT:  Title track.  Starts with a funky, almost stride-sounding piano, and the funk just builds from there.  This sounds like Billy Joel in his prime.  EXCELLENT!<br />JUST FRIENDS:  A rough-edged mid-tempo ballad. Bittersweet lyrics and soulful vocals make this a standout track.  Nice harmonies on the bridge add to the heartfelt emotion.  GORGEOUS!<br />[NICE TO MEET YOU]ANYWAY: This track starts out quietly, with muted guitars and understated vocals.  It builds in the second verse with guitar smacks and Gavin's rollicking keyboard work.  More shades of Billy Joel, only better.  <br />CHEMICAL PARTY:  Hilarious!  Starts very quietly, but immediately in the chorus the guitars start thundering.  The second verse adds to the wry humor.  Gavin, &quot;you're not too drunk; you made your point&quot;!<br />BELIEF:  Some of the most beautiful, wrenching lyrics I've heard recently.  A slower tempo than most of the other tracks adds legitimacy to the angst the lyrics are drenched in.  <br />CRUSH:  Starts with a typical Billy Joel guitar-ridden intro, but goes so very much further!  This has got to be the most rocking love song I've ever had the distinct pleasure to listen to.  One of my favorite tracks!<br />I DON'T WANT TO BE:  Some people are familiar with this song as the theme to the television show One Tree Hill.  Others might know it from SuperBowl promos.  EVERYONE should know this song.  It begins with a very LedZep sounding guitar riff and continues into a chorus reminiscent of Maroon5.  Of all the tracks, this one has the hardest rock edge.<br />MEANING:  Gavin begins with a delicate falsetto that segues into a very folky, infectious tune.  Very soulful vocal runs near the end make this another one of my favorite tracks.<br />MORE THAN ANYONE:  The slowest cut, this one offers a new take on the universal friendship and love theme.  Gavin's voice has some rougher edges in this song that work well with the lyrics.  The piano takes on the fervor of a gospel choir in this track.<br />OVER-RATED:  Another track that starts so quietly, only to build immediately into a beat-heavy tune.  The chorus brings to mind parallels of later Beatles work overlaid with Sir Elton piano funk, especially in the chords and harmonies.  <br />I play this CD at least once a day, and I can highly recommend it to anyone who likes a good singer/songwriter.  If you like Jason Mraz, Josh Kelley, Ben Jelen, or Damien Rice, add this one to your collection.  You will NOT regret it.
B0000019PA|5.0|For any underground-band-loving obscurist with a taste for strange melodies and lyrics that would blow the mind of any poet, Neutral Milk Hotel is the epitome of a good band.  If you are going to judge a band by the fact that Jeff Mangum's voice doesn't have much range or is anything remarkable in itself and are giving this band bad reviews because of it, you do not need to be giving reviews. No, Neutral Milk Hotel was not meant to be REM, and will never be. If you're looking for catchy cliche lyrics and ordinary rhythmic tunes, I will tell you right now, you will not like this band. Neutral Milk Hotel's lyrics are so powerful within themselves, and the music that accompanies it just further emphasises the expression, the significance, the power of Jeff Mangum's words as they leave his lips. The lyrics are so meaningful and genuine that they don't even rely on language to be explained. The music defines the tone of his songs, and all of it together results in something so evocative that I haven't heard in many other bands in my life. If you're looking for something true, genuine, evocative and mind-blowing AWESOME, please listen to this CD. You'll never forget it
B00008X5J5|4.0|There is little doubt that this film is one of Disney's all-time greatest animated features. It's had a tremendous impact on our culture, for instance in the way we, for better or worse, imagine feminity and define beauty (Aurora as Barbie?). And Sleeping Beauty has of course also been parodied (as for example recently in Shrek). There can be few quibbles concerning this movie's iconic status, whether one agrees with its politics or not. It's definitely worth seeing and owning.<br />My query concerns the restoration that's been carried out. Yes, the image is much clearer and it all sounds great, as many of the other reviewers point out. The special features are marvellous too. But has nobody noticed that Aurora's dress, in the famous scene at the end of the film, looks orange instead of pink? In my older copy of the film the color alternates between pink and blue, but in my recently acquired print of the Special Edition Double DVD set the dress most definitely changes to orange. My 7-year old immediately noticed this and was, rightly, puzzled. One doesn't expect such a drastic change in coloration from one print to the next, and I cannot believe that the original print would have shown orange when the dialogue clearly implies pink. And one doesn't expect this in a restored Special Edition DVD.
068483605X|5.0|Watership Down is an amazing book. That someone could write 429 pages (hardcover version) on a real-life epic about rabbits and make it work is simply incredible, beyond anything I could ever hope to accomplish. You laugh, maybe, that one would want to write any exciting book about rabbits at all, but frankly, you can't imagine it unless you've been there.<br />Watership Down is a story of the journey of a group of rabbits that flee their home warren after Fiver, the runt of his litter, has one of his premonitions of doom. It follows headstrong Bigwig, leader Hazel, storyteller Dandelion, and all the others, in their quest for a mystical hill over the next horizon, Watership Down. Spanning epic length, their passage across the countryside takes them to places darker than the rabbit mind can fathom. Throughout the story, the influence of man upon natural life often intrudes, for good or ill, or, more often, causing inscrutable confusion, like the machinations of a distant god. Even after adjusting to the hardships of life, the rabbits' subsequent search for does bring them to a sinister military rabbit community like no other, the mighty Efrafa. Granted that rabbits are usually stronger, faster, and smarter than other woodland creatures, these guys could kick Redwall to the moon. <br />But seriously, Watership is a powerful book, and, as you've probably read from the better reviews out there, the morals of the lapine societies parallel many ethics and political ideas in the real world. It's a book that can be read on many levels, with the confrontation of death, destruction of the environment, and cost of freedom. I personally think the two great strengths of the book come from the creation of a rabbit culture and the development of the characters. Richard Adams has crafted a world with its own language and customs. The stories of the legendary trickster El-Ahrairah are fit for any book of fables, next to characters like Anansi or Brer Rabbit. They provide a nice parallel to the plot. And like all great stories, our heroes are changed by the experience of the journey. Hazel develops into a true leader of his rabbits and Fiver becomes a trusted, well, psychic prophet. When Bigwig finally stands against the General, we're cheering for him all the way. These are rabbits we care about. <br />Obviously, this book is not for everyone. There will be those who refuse to read it simply because there are talking rabbits. But I would recommend this book to anyone and everyone with enough patience to read a thick book. If you have enough maturity to appreciate the Lord of the Rings for things other than orc-bashing, then by all means, read this!
B00011RPB0|1.0|This is one of the worst movies ever. It is a pity that Murray, such a great actor, had to play this part in such a bad story. When one hears the title of this movie, one expects something deeper about the problems found in translation when you are in a foreign country. It is not easy to express what you have undergone in a foreign country, so such a task should not be attempted by a movie director if he/she can't make his/her screenplay live up to its title.<br />This movie is about a sappy love story. More ridiculous than this story? Impossible. There is an actor on business in Tokyo who has few translation problems while in business in Tokyo. He has mild predicaments with his wife(who is in America) because he forgot all about his kid's birthday. He meets this woman married to a dweeb photograper who can't tell his right nostril from his left one. There is something that could be called an attraction between them. This woman's husband has to go somewhere on business, which makes her completely free to betray him. In the end, this actor (Murray) kisses her in the middle of the street, giving you the impression that it is all right to betray your spouse when you have been for a long time in a foreign country, after all, you might be so needy in such a situation...<br />Something else that got on my nerves was that Coppola depicted the Japanese people as stupid morons. Yes, that is the idea that is transmitted by this movie. She should have known better that it takes a lot of intelligence to build a country like Japan.<br />So this movie is translation used as a subterfuge to film a sappy story in a picturesque country.<br />Don't buy this DVD unless you like superficial content... otherwise, this is the movie for you.
B0001AP12G|4.0|West's production made him famous and it's the same production that validates his solo effort \\"College Dropout.\\"  With clever and introspective tracks such as \\"All Falls Down\\" and \\"Two Words\\" this is certainly a solid record; however, Kanye's biggest weakness is his ability to actually rap.  Lyrically and production wise this is at the top of its class but his shortness of breath and slurred lines take away from the album as a whole.
0553382179|5.0|I love the book, I have part of it i got from their site by printing. They have a group called flymentors on yahoo groups.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I have to say that this album is truly fantastic!  If you had told me 5 years ago that Britney would make something of this caliber, I would never have believed it.  Boy did she prove me wrong!  Every single song on this album is great, especially &quot;Toxic&quot; &amp; &quot;Touch of My Hand.&quot;  Do me a favor and ignore the haters because they obviously have not heard this album!  I highly recommend this to anyone &amp; everyone, it has wonderful variety and is great for repeated listening.  Don't hesitate because you won't regret the purchase!
B0000WN0ZK|4.0|Great filmmaking with loads of nice metaphor. I especially like the way the director adapted the original short story into screen. It would be unthinkable for many to conceived the way of adapting it in the first place. Abstract ideas at last found the perfect way in.<br />The transfer is excellent and sharper than all the previous releases since this is the first DVD appearance there is no way to doubt it. <br />There is a digitally fogged scene of pubic hair at the studio when the young aspired to be model are struggling with David Hemmings.<BR>That scene on LD was intacted. Why this timidity, I wonder? It's doesn't hurt the content of course but afterall these years with the first pubic hair on supposedly the big mainstream film.
B00007GZR5|5.0|Great movie, almost as good as the book... it's one of those movies you'll watch over and over...
B00018D44U|5.0|Her voice is just so soothing and this album has a little more country, which I enjoyed.
B00005JMEW|1.0|If this isn't the most overhyped movie ever.  Where is the Tarentino magic here?  Was there any magical conversation pieces found in Resevoir Dogs? No.  Just brutal, over the top violence.<br />I was immensely disappointed.  The movie was a joke.  It's the old story of when your outnumbered 100-1 in a fight, you're actually at an advantage.  Doesn't that become tiresome?  The movie did!
B000066NW0|1.0|Avril Lavigne is a shrill, pointless little girl trying to act like she's musically gifted.  Sadly, she is not original to any degree.  Her songs are cliche and her false presentation of herself as the anti-Britney is disgusting.  Perhaps I'm the only person who saw her hanging out with Nikki Hilton and Nicole Richie on &quot;Celebrities Uncensored.&quot; For someone who likes to act like she is above the industry, she sure does succumb to it rather easily.  The saddest fact is that Avril has convinced herself that she is an &quot;artist,&quot; but she's a sham through and through.  Just [try to] listen to the agonizing &quot;Sk8ter Boi&quot; and it will become instantly clear that this is one of those CDs that one is embarrassed to have purchased later in life.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I became so bored I could eat my foot. I'm very curious as to what they think about this movie in Japan.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Emotional states cannot be communicated using language? Are you kidding me? Is this what passes for 'avant-garde' in the age of decadence and debauchery? A brackish blend of quotidian malaise and deplorably vapid psychology, this movie leaves one certain of two things: primo, that we're out of ideas, and, secundo, that most everyone is suffering from some sort of mnesic deficiency that prevents them from noticing and makes hacks like Sophia Coppola rich and famous. <br />This isn't groundbreaking, folks, and it's too cliche to warrant further dissection. Contrived, banal, and puerile. Fine acting, but who cares when the movie isn't entertaining? No aesthetic pleasure will be found here - move along.
B00005LC3Y|4.0|Many people who see this movie have no idea why it has a near cult following in the U.S.. In the editorial at the product site I read a comment that said: &quot;... he seemed out of touch with the vouge...made people wonder why he even made this film...&quot; True the movie didn't havce much pop-culture apeal, but it does have the loyalist constituancy any movie could ever have, the U.S. Marine Corps. Marines generally love this movie. It is one of the most true to life depictions of what we go through in boot-camp that has ever been put to screen. In the movie we all see at least a few scenes of boot-camp life we ourselves experienced.
B0000636UN|4.0|This might not be Sheryl Crow's best album but it features some of her best tracks. <br />Safe And Sound I think is her best song yet, the eeirly dark yet hopeful melody on top of her desperate vocals on that track is just flat out amazing.<br />Soak up the sun, you can't get much more out of a feel good track then this.<br />And the album closer, Weather Channel leaves you with another lo-fi sounding track. <br />I think Sheryl Crow is at her best on the minor key, darker tracks, and there aren't a whole lot of them on this album, but the ones that are there are great.
B00000099Y|5.0|No modern rock band has thusfar had the courage (or the ability) to seamlessly intertwine blistering metal riffs with the experimental techniques popularized by Syd Barrett and Roger Waters thirty years ago.  Except for Tool.  Hearing singles on the radio or seeing music videos does no justice to the coherent quality of Aenima or Lateralus; sitting through an entire album undistracted is the only way.  Brilliant, imaginative, haunting, etc are all superlatives failing to describe what only repeated listening will grant you.  My advice: if you like The Wall, and I mean front to back, you will salivate over Aenima.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I first heard the single &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; on the radio and fell in love with it.  Not too long later, I saw Jet perform on Saturday Night Live.  From that moment on I was hooked.  I went to the store the next day and bought &quot;Get Born&quot; and I couldn't have been more pleased.  Every song on the album is strong.  Every song makes me want to sing along.  These guys are talented musicians and song writers.  If you're considering picking this album up, do it.  You won't be sorry.
0792844602|5.0|Film Buffs look to your neighbors across the Pond. I ordered &quot;A Matter of Life or Death in VHS/Pal and converted it to DVD.The Brits have it in DVD/PAL The locals (USA) dont seem to want to budge (people who could get this on DVD). I'd suggest the same with this wonderful movie. I wrote to Carlton Films/e-mail to check on titles. Film Buffs of the Classics of Korda - there is a wealth of film sitting on the shelf. To serve the many the few are forgotten. Thanks.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|Okay, so I haven't purchased in new band CD in a long, long time.  I'm a fan of the Beatles and other 60's and 70's rock.  Maybe that's why I love Jet's &quot;Get Born&quot; so damn much.  The tunes are raw and definitely rockin.  &quot;Are You Gonna Be My Girl&quot; is just the beginnin.  Don't buy the album if that's the way you want all of the songs to sound.  If you're in to the heavier garage sound mixed with some great slow tunes, this is the album for you.  The guys in Jet are great musicians and song writers.  I love every song on the album.  If you're thinking of buying it, go for it!  You won't be sorry.
B00006J3WH|5.0|The first time I saw ONCE MORE, WITH FEELING, I was stunned.  This episode was outrageous, terrific, one of the greatest things I've ever seen on that 36&quot;!  Now that the soundtrack is out, we can finally appreciate Joss Whedon's genius till the day we die.<br />Whedon, the creator of both the BUFFY and ANGEL television series, wrote all the songs and music and even performs most of them.  The actual stars sing each song.  It's awesome!  We begin with &quot;Overture/Going Through the Motions&quot;, a very funny song featuring Buffy (Sarah Michelle Gellar).  Then we go to &quot;I've Got a Theory&quot;, a composition featuring some wacky &quot;Bunny&quot; ideas sung by Anya.  We also have such masterpieces as &quot;The Mustard&quot; (They got ... the mustard ... out!!!) and &quot;The Parking Ticket&quot;, along with a rockin' &quot;Rest in Peace&quot; sung by Spike (James Marsters).  There's also Tara's &quot;Under Your Spell&quot;, a beautiful song which should've won an Emmy for sure.  One of my favorites is &quot;Walk Through the Fire&quot;, sung by everyone in the cast.  <br />To finish it off, there is a special &quot;Main Title&quot; by Nerf Herder and some terrific instrumental compositions by Christophe Beck (particularly &quot;Sacrifice&quot;).  The finale song is a demo sung by Whedon and his wife, who sings quite beautifully for her first time singing out of the shower territory.<br />All in all, &quot;Once More, with Feeling&quot; is one of the greatest musicals of all time.  Joss Whedon is a pure genius.  Mr. Whedon, I worship you.
B000002572|5.0|The only people that need to read any reviews on this CD are the ones that are newly born.<br />If you like classic rock, then CD will rock you!<br />A must have!<br />Don't hesitate to check out my newly published book:<br />\\"Under the Rose: Poetry of Tragedy, Essence and Romance\\"
0385510438|5.0|This was an excellent book.  I've read many of Grisham's books, lately I've been reading Stephen King.  I've only begun reading again the past three months.  I bought this book at an airport for my flight across the US.  I picked it up on a Sunday and finished it on Tuesday.  It was a great book, hard to put down.  I was happier reading this book than I would have been watching my favorite TV shows.  For me, that is saying quite a bit.  Keeps you guessing til the end.  Grisham comes through again!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Powerful soundtrack; if you seen the movie, and you probably did, then you already know.<br />You may not even need to read any reviews about this soundtrack if you seen the movie.<br />You already know it's good...<br />Don't hesitate to check out my newly published book:<br />\\"Under the Rose: Poetry of Tragedy, Essence and Romance\\"
B00013F35I|3.0|Having seen the Cleveland and Pittsburgh shows on the Rising tour and loving the NYC DVD I was jazzed for this one.  Unfortunately, the sound stinks.  If you experiment with some of your receiver's digital signal processing settings you can pump it up a little bit but that is an artificial solution that you should not have to do.  All the more tragic in that you can tell the band was really on that night and the fans were into the show.  At the beginning of Badlands, you can see Bruce's hand do the signature slide down the neck of the guitar but you sure can't hear anything. The sound is just awful.     Buy it as a momento of a classic tour but don't expect too much.  The PCM 2 channel stereo actually sounds a little better than the surround.  Some tin eared engineer deserves to be fired over this one.
B000050FEN|5.0|I think that Se7en is one of the best movies I've ever seen. <br />It is thrilling and shocking to see how a man, here the great Kevin Spacey as John Doe, creates such a suspense by judging his victims based on the seven deadly sins.<br />The film shows very well that brutality and intelligence are often very close to each other, which makes this film so exciting - you never know what'll happen next.<br />Furthermore you can see the different characters of two detectives fantastic-played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt.<br />All in all a thrilling masterpiece of Hollywood!<br />YOU HAVE TO WATCH IT!!!
B00006RU5B|5.0|I can't believe there aren't at least a dozen glowing reviews here... so I'll try and remedy the situation somewhat... First off, I remember Soundgarden, they had their moments (&quot;Black Hole Sun&quot; top of the list), and I remember Temple of the Dog, too, which was great and sounded more like Audioslave (maybe they'll do &quot;Hunger Strike&quot; live for old times' sake?)... I also knew about RATM, liked a couple songs (&quot;Bulls on Parade&quot; of course) and respected their politics more than their music.  Not a big rap fan... But the cool thing was, when I first saw the video for Cochise, I didn't know anything about this &quot;supergroup&quot; thing, and I sure as heck didn't recognize Cornell from his old long-haired Soundgarden days.  (Where the hell were those eyes hiding?)  I just thought... well, something along the lines of &quot;Oh my god, who are these guys and where can I get their album NOW?!?!&quot;<br />Only later did I realize who it was... but by then I was already committed.  What a fantastic album!  Morello's brilliant (he must've been listening to Vai and Satriani back when I was 'cuz he's afflicted with the same magical ability to make a guitar do things it ain't supposed to be able to do!)... The rhythm section is unbelievably versatile and infectious, who else can go from pow-wow music to funk to straightforward heavy metal all in one song?... And Cornell is nothing short of a true poet.  &quot;The Last Remaining Light&quot; is as close to a perfect piece of music as I've seen on a rock album -- I hope they extend it when they play it live!<br />People complaining that the politicism of RATM is gone need to take out their little lyric booklet and read the dang things.  Duh.  Just 'cuz it ain't hollered in rhyme form don't mean it ain't sayin' something, kids.  &quot;Hypnotize,&quot; anybody? And how about &quot;Set it Off?&quot; Now I'm going back and listening to some of that RATM stuff now just to hear Morello do his thing...  Thefunk is sweet, no argument there, but let me be the first to say I'm much happier listening to Chris sing than Zach yell.  But I guess maybe that's just a taste thing.  But Audioslave is obviously a group of men, not boys.  The songs examine spirituality, politics, philosophy (&quot;Exploder&quot; is fascinating), the stuff of an intelligent and inquisitive mind.  The musicians are maturing, experimenting, playing with their influences, and it shows in wondrous ways.<br />Note to Audioslave:  At 33, I thought I was past falling completely &quot;in love&quot; with a band. You guys have proved me wrong.  I will buy every album you make, sight unseen.  As a writer, I've been inspired by the first album to start a new novel; can't wait to see what the next one does to me!  Keep up the good work.  Please!
0385504209|2.0|Secret societies, albino monks, murder, mystery... what more could I have asked for? I should have asked for more! The background or pseudo-history of secret societies and hidden religions was very facinating. The writing style was horrible, though. As each chapter passed, I found the formula of *answer a question* then *find a clue* then *ask another question* then *turn to the next chapter* tiring. I doubt this entire escapade took only a day and a half! And the Scooby Doo ending to boot!
B0001AP12G|5.0|OK, in a time where people are infatuated with blacks calling themselves &quot;gangstas&quot; and bragging about being shot up, Kanye West kicks down that stereotype wearing a Polo shirt w/ the collar flipped up, and his Louis Vitton backpack. The production, lyricism, and humor on this CD is amazing, the only downside is that on a few of his skits he degrades the value and importance of college. As a black male currently attending a prestigious college, I feel that this is the only let-down on the cd. Besides that, it is an instant classic.<br />1. Intro (skit) - n/a<br />2. We Don't Care - 4/5<BR>   - Great beat, good hook. The first line people hear is &quot;Drug dealing just to get high&quot;, and might turn them off. Keep listening, it's actually a positive song.<br />3. Graduation (skit) - n/a<br />4. All Falls Down ft. Syleena Johnson - 4/5<BR>   - A very intelligent song, with witty wordplay that can only make you chuckle.<br />5. I'll Fly Away<BR>   - This is more of an interlude, but the harmonies are good and it takes you back to church for a minute.<br />6. Spaceship ft. GLC &amp; Consequence - 3/5<BR>   - A little repetative. The lowest rated song on the album, and it still gets a 3 out of 5.<br />7. Jesus Walks - 5/5<BR>   - One of, if not, the best song on the album. Perfect message, HOT beat, intricate lyricism. Plus, it takes you back to church with the choir-like background.<br />8. Never Let Me Down ft. Jay-Z &amp; J.Ivy - 5/5<BR>   - When I first heard this song I thought it was so inspirational and moving. Then when I heard this version, with Jay-Z's second verse... It deserves the 5 of 5, simple as that.<br />9. Get 'Em High ft. Talib Kweli &amp; Common - 4/5<BR>   - Hot beat, not a positive message, but does every song have to be? This song is downright hilarious though. Especially when he calls up Talib Kweli to impress a girl, and Kweli spits his verse over the phone.<br />10. Workout Plan (skit) - n/a<br />11. The New Workout Plan - 5/5<BR>- Miri Ben-Ari's violin performance on this song is very exceptional. The beat is intricate, he has humor that makes you laugh out loud, and the &quot;interviews&quot; with women who have used his workout plan is the best.<br />12. Slow Jamz ft. Twista &amp; Jamie Foxx - 4/5<BR>   - Radio has played this song time &amp; time again. With Jamie Foxx's new ad-libbing in the middle, this song still hasn't grown old.<br />13. Breate In, Breathe Out ft. Ludacris - 4/5<BR>   - I wish Ludacris would've done more than just the hook. Hot beat, funny lyrics. The song is about material things and such, but it's still good.<br />14. School Spirit 1 (skit) - n/a<br />15. School Spirit - 4/5<BR>   - Names all of the big frats &amp; soras. I'm not sure if he's downing college or not, but the song is still listenable. Humerous lyrics, once again.<br />16. School Spirit 2 (skit) - n/a<br />17. Lil' Jimmy (skit) - n/a<br />18. Two Words ft. Mos Def, Freeway, Harlem Boys Choir - 4/5<BR>   - Once again, Miri Ben-Ari's violin playing is exceptional. I can't wait for her CD to drop. Mos Def rips his verse quite well, Freeway is Freeway, and the Harlem Boys Choir adds a harmonic breeze to the song.<br />19. Through The Wire - 5/5<BR>    - How can someone spit so well, even when his jaw is wired shut? Simply amazing. His lyrics, however, sounds a lot like Jay-Z's flow, but I'm going to let that slide because it's just so good.<br />20. Family Business - 5/5<BR>   - The children's toy piano that plays all over the song is unique. I like the samples of speeches, and it's interesting hearing of his family. All of the general stories are so true, like sleeping head-to-toe with your cousins when there weren't enough beds, etc.<br />21. Last Call - 4/5<BR>   - 12 min. long! and every minute is worth it. The first few minutes are of him rapping and spitting the best line of the entire album &quot;I'm killin y'all N****s on that lyrical S***/ Mayonnaise colored Benz/ I push Miracle Whips&quot;.The rest of the track is of him talking to the listener(s), and explaining to them the entire process and long road it took for him to get where he is today.<br />Overall, this is a classic CD. Well worth the money you spend. Everyone should purchase this and not download it. There are things on this cd that were never on the downloads (such as redone beats, added verses, etc.). This is rap music. This is Kanye West...
B00003CXA2|5.0|Didn't anyone get this movie?<BR>I have been watching the reviews before and after I wrote mine,<BR>and wonder if satire is lost on everyone.<BR>The negative comments I see are because it was taken at face value.
B00005RRG9|5.0|Few movies of my childhood had more of an emotional effect on me than \\"The Parent Trap.\\"  My introduction to this movie was the typical one for a Gen-Xer- watching it on \\"The Wonderful World of Disney.\\"  I remember being enthralled with this movie and can recall feeling a little depressed when it ended.  I would be absolutely drawn into the story and wonder why girls as \\"cool\\" as \\"Sharon and \\"Susan\\" didn't go to my grade school.  (I sometimes wonder whether this movie influenced my long-time attraction to short-haired tomboys which has unfortunately led to me developing crushes on several gay women over the years.)<br />I know I am not alone in my fondness for \\"The Parent Trap.\\"  It is one of Disney's most beloved movies and for good reason- it just exudes warm-hearted sentimentality.  That Disney was able to pull this off is tribute to the director, writer, and actors because there is a VERY thin line between warm-hearted sentiment and treacly, syrupy schmaltz.  \\"The Parent Trap\\" sometimes comes dangerously close to falling over the edge- that impromptu performance of \\"Let's Get Together\\" always made me cringe rather than tap my feet, but it never plunges into the well of sappiness.<br />However, I must ask has there ever been a more cruel child custody agreement?  The parents divorce with each taking one of their twin daughters and then going off to live completely seperate lives.  Neither parent seemed to make any attempt to stay in contact with the child in the other's custody or inform the sisters of their twin's existence.  What kind of parents are these people?  Oh, who cares!! It's a pointless exercise for an adult to over-analyze one of the great children's films.  As a child I loved \\"The Parent Trap\\" for what it was- one of the funniest and most endearing movies that Disney has ever made.  It's a true classic that has withstood the test of time.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Bill Murray turns in his strongest performance as Bob Harris, a once-popular American actor who is travelling to Tokyo, Japan to shoot a commercial. Bob knows that he has been almost not heard of by the young generation in his country, and no longer spoken of by the generation who once loved his films. He gets more praise and respect from the people in Japan. When he first arrives at the hotel in Tokyo, he is greeted and treated by some of the strangest and often hilarious characters as you'll see. He sits continually in the bar staring into space, waiting out his time to go home. <br />On the other side of the fence is Scarlett Johansson as Charlotte, a mysterious young woman who is half Bob's age, who he begins to fixate on and she on him. Charlotte is married to a youthful and famous photographer working on an important shoot in Tokyo, and so she spends her days (like Bob), staring out into space - searching for something that will never come in that image she stares at. It seems like every time Bob and Charlotte step out of their rooms, somehow they see each other...whether it be in the elevator, in the swimming pool hall, or at the bar...they see each other. Soon, they realize that each of them are looking for pretty much the same thing: life. When Charlotte asks Bob to come with her to meet a few friends, the two come together like pages in a book being binded. At first, it simply seems like a harmless, strong friendship, but in reality, both know that it is a beautiful affair relationship as Bob has his wife and kids at home, and Charlotte has her husband taking photos every day.  The sad thing is, is that they both know that the relationship which has become so close and real, will never last and that eventually Bob will have to leave...<br />Sofia Coppola's masterful direction and the beautiful atmosphere create an overall atmospheric and well-crafted tale of love and curiosity of the unknown. Coppola writes with such realistic tension and style that it wasalmost as if I saw these characters outside my bedroom window, or as if they were one of my own family members. The entire story is touching and heartwarming, filled with hilarious moments along the way. The connection between Murray and Johanssan is pure magical and the two of them seem meant to be. The difference between ages of the two makes it even more a touching film as Charlotte seeks out love, kindness and attention from Bob and he seeks out the same thing from her. The music is another excellent thing about this film, as it adds the modern touch to the images captured from this modern city of Tokyo, Japan. Some of the music is rock and roll which we are all familiar with which adds a sense of familiarity to the characters in the story. <br />I can sum up all of my review with one word. There is only one word that could ever pay the best compliment to a film or a book: great.
B0000C6E4D|4.0|This is a beautiful album, one that is perfect background music to an artsy day, but that doesn't have the emotional or musical complexity of &quot;Surfacing&quot; or &quot;Fumbling Towards Ecstacy.&quot;  <br />&quot;Fallen&quot; is incredibly beautiful, a song that I replayed multiple times upon first hearing the album.  &quot;Perfect Girl,&quot; &quot;World on Fire,&quot; and &quot;Train Wreck&quot; are lovely songs too, but overall, there wasn't much to sing along to on this. <BR> <BR>This is in part because Sarah's voice is frequently drowned out by the instruments.  And the notes themselves seem to be right in the middle of her range, so that while she sings beautifully, it can be nearly impossible to hear what she's saying.  This just makes it seem more like background music.<br />It's lovely, though.  If you want this sound with a bit more emotion and poppiness, try her other albums.  They're fantastic.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I love this DVD set!! Includes all 21 first season episodes, in a nice box set. Basically, I love Superman, and I love the TV Series &quot;Smallville&quot;. Superman as a teenager going through what all of us do with an extra burden - to help people with his alien talents and not let anyone know. Begins with the story we all know so well about the meteors, and &quot;him&quot; finding the Kents. Then it expands brilliantly on that, how Smallville becomes a town &quot;cursed&quot; with people who are infected/affected by Kryponite fallout, but mostly focuses on how Clark Kent/Superman comes to possess and develop each new talent. This series really develops Superman in a new way - we come to understand why he is the way he is. These DVDs explore his hometown, childhood friends (whom include his arch-enemy Lex Luthor), and his parents Jonathan and Martha Kent. You get to care for the characters, know them. You never get bored, always eager for the next episode. Superb acting! Not to mention watching gorgeous Tom Welling as Superman is a definite plus! I wish the DVD set had better bonus features, or at least a music video but, overall it rocks!!! All I have to say is when is the next season coming out on DVD? Whether you are a Smallville fan, just a Superman fan, or just plain &quot;curious&quot;, this is the DVD for you! Action, drama, comedy, sci-fi, romance, and suspense!!!
0792165020|1.0|i saw this movie in the theater when it came out because i like that matt damon and philip seymour hoffman.  however, after what seemed like 9 hours waiting for something to happen in this film, it ended.  maybe i missed the point, because it seemed to me the point was to make the audience very bored!
B000089CJI|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the most brilliant albums to have graced this new musical generation.  Their almost biblical simplicity and sound is well deserved karmic retribution for the abundance of crap which has been thrown at us from every direction.  This is truely beautiful.
6305428050|5.0|if i've said it once, i've said it a million times: keith coogan, where are you?  this 1987 flick is hysterical!  ya think?
0452282152|5.0|A story based only on a painter and one of his portrait paintings, Girl with a Pearl Earring, captures you into a world that can only be described as remarkable. By remarkable, I do not mean a perfect world but a very realistic world. This story is about the life of a lower class girl in the 17th Century. The main character, Griet, is in a way, forced to work as a maid for a famous artist when her father loses his eyesight and loses his job as a tile painter. The story spins a wild tale of an emotional affair that occurs between the famous painter, Vermeer and Griet. The author, Tracy Chevalier, wrote this book from Griet's point of view, which shows her interpretation of what is happening around her. <br />As a fairly unimaginative person, I believe this book creates its own world in each one of the readers and everyone has their own understanding of it. I really think that when people read this book, they can immediately picture the whole story. I've read this book many times and again; every time I feel as if I was there throughout the story and that I really know the characters in it. New details seem to protrude and make the story even more prominent with each time I read it. Griet seems like a pretty innocent girl and quite naïve which made me think of what I would be in her situation and makes me wonder if I would be like her. The ending was the opposite of what I wanted or expected to happen. Throughout the whole story, I felt hope for Griet to get what she wanted, which mostly she didn't get but she was flexible and went with whatever came her way. She did not seem like a very emotionally strong person with feelings but she seems like she has many deep thoughts that are unexpressed.<br />     Overall, the book is extremely touching - not the actual writing of the book because it's slightly vague when it came to Griet's feelings but it's depressing when you realize that Griet felt that she had to end up in that position and she felt she needed to give up whatever she could.
B00013PHGS|3.0|Not what I expected from Air.  I've been so happy listening to Moon Safari all these years (as well as everyone else that I know) and was very excited to hear their new CD and possibly even watch them in concert in April, but then I listened to it and wasn't very impressed.  Nothing on there really moved me, except maybe Cherry Blossom Girl.  But I had already listened to that off of my Lost in Translation soundtrack.  I'd much rather listen to that soundtrack than this CD.  Sorry.
B00005JLZN|4.0|Must see...don't watch trailers - its much better if you figure it out on your own.  It is not a movie I would watch over and over yet the first time was great.
B00007BH5C|5.0|I've waited to review this album until all three soundtracks to \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" film trilogy have been released. Each soundtrack is better than the one before it, but all three are incredible, five-star albums. They are assembled on CD to create the best listening experience possible, conveying massive scores in seventy-minute packages that stand on their own as great achievements in orchestral/choral music. Lovers of film music, fantasy, and concert music will want to own all three CDs. In this second chapter, Howard Shore darkens and expands his musical palette, setting up the apocalypse and power of the third album.<br />The \\"Two Towers\\" album is more jumbled than the \\"Fellowship\\" one. The cues are not in the strict of the story, and music from different parts of the film are often assembled into a single track to make a sort of mini-suite. (For example, the track \\"The White Rider\\" combines the music for Gandalf curing King Theoden, Gandalf's sudden appearance in Fangorn forest, and his riding out of Edoras to find Eomer.) This was necessary to make the album work as a listening experience, since the film itself isn't as straightforward and linear as \\"The Fellowship of the Ring,\\" and so the music requires some juggling to create an effective album. Shore certainly succeeds; \\"Two Towers\\" is an even more engaging, and exciting listening experience than the first album, and it builds wonderfully toward its conclusion.<br />The major new theme is a stirring piece written for the country of Rohan. Using an old Scandanavian fiddle as the central instrument, Shore crafts a melody filled with the strength of a proud people. You can hear the echoes of the Anglo-Saxon culture that J.R.R. Tolkien loved so much in this theme -- it's one of the best in all three film scores. The theme appears in fullest form in the track \\"The Riders of Rohan,\\" which starts with the music for Aragorn and his companions encountering Eomer and his riders, then switches the King Theoden'sawakening from Saruman's spell and reclaiming his kingdom. (The gentle but strong theme for Eowyn also appears here.) The theme is also the basis for \\"The King of the Golden Hall,\\" which covers Gandalf and Aragorn arriving at Theoden's hall, and later Theoden weeping over his son's tomb.<br />Gollum has two themes: one for his evil personality (heard in \\"The Taming of Smeagol\\") and another for his kinder, \\"Smeagol\\" personality (heard in \\"The Forbidden Pool,\\" and derived from the theme heard when the title \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" appear on screen; Shore calls this \\"the ring history theme\\"). The Ents have a lumbering theme using wood blocks (very appropriate) heard in \\"Treebeard.\\" Soft, Elven music dominates the tracks \\"Evenstar\\" (Aragorn's flashback to his farewell to Arwen), \\"The Leave-Taking\\" (Arwen departing with the Elves, and Elrond's silent debate with Galadriel), and \\"Breath of Life\\" (Aragorn recovering by the river). These are nice pieces to interrupt the growing fury and darkness of the album.<br />The themes from the first film all re-appear, and most of them are re-capped in the exciting track \\"The Uruk-hai.\\" We hear the heroic Fellowship Theme, the towering Mordor Theme, and industrial, `metallic-banging' theme for Saruman and his armies. The beautiful Shire theme for Frodo and Samwise plays out in \\"Samwise the Brave,\\" the emotional capper to the album.<br />The action tracks are superb, and improve on \\"Fellowship.\\" The opening track, \\"Foundations of Stone,\\" will plunge you down with Gandalf and the Balrog into the depths of the Earth with a powerful choral accompaniment. It's about as exciting an opening to a soundtrack as I can imagine. Thundering trumpets accompany the attack by the wargs in \\"Helm's Deep,\\" while tension grows and grows as the Uruks first lay siege to Helm's Deep on the track, \\"The Hornburg.\\"<br />The score hits the action climax with \\"Forth Eorlingas\\" and \\"Isengard Unleashed.\\" The first uses the Rohan Theme, Gandalf Theme, and Fellowship Theme to create a mind-blowing, heroic finale to the film's massive battle scene; the solo boy's voice at the end is incredibly moving. The second track combines the death of Haldir at Helm's Deep and the retreat from the Orcs storming the fortress with the Ents overwhelming Isengard and flooding it. Shore excels here with building tension through rising music that doesn't resolve itself (one of his favorite techniques) until the track almost overwhelms you with its power.<br />The score ends with a vocal track for Gollum sung by Italian/Icelandic singer Emiliana Torrini. This is a haunting piece, and the best of the three songs written for the trilogy. It's certainly not terribly commercial, but that's what makes it so excellent. You can truly here Gollum's pain in the lyrics and the singer's aching, childlike voice: \\"You are lost, you can never go home.\\"<br />The only problem with this soundtrack album -- and all the albums have this same flaw -- is that there is so much music in the film that only about a third can fit here. As great a listening experience as this album is, it would be nice to have an expanded two-disc version some time in the near future. (Certainly, it would sell tons of copies, so Sony Music should really get on this project right away!)
B00008PW2E|5.0|must you torture me so? why? please please PLEASE let me see season 2 in all its F'd up glory PLEASE ... i am begging...
B00005JMJ4|2.0|This movie was visually interesting but, otherwise, a completely unengaging stinker.  I saw Sophia on the Charlie Rose program and liked her very much.  It gives me no pleasure to be so blunt about this film.  I am amazed at the critical enthusiasm and pre-Oscar hoopla.  If there is ANYthing here, it entirely escaped me.  (If you're reading this, Sophia, please don't be depressed.  You're charming.  It is more worthy to be an engaging human being than to make a good film.  Besides, you'll probably do much better next time.)
B000089CJI|4.0|In 2003 Ben Gibbard made two profound musical statements. His sympathetic vocal style fit perfectly alongside the warm electronica of The Postal Service's \\"Give Up\\", as well as the lush guitar sound of Death Cab for Cutie's \\"Transatlanticism\\". Both albums are very good efforts, which makes a case for Ben Gibbard as the most important person in music in 2003. The Postal Service used a variety of programmed beats and arrangements alongside some of the most terrific vocals you're likely to hear anywhere to produce \\"Give Up\\", which is one of the most pleasant listening experiences of the past year. This is a feelgood album, even though the lyrics are not always optimistic. Gibbard's voice, as well as the voices of his backup vocalists Jenny Lewis and Jen Wood, just make you feel good. The programmed beats on the album are diverse and extremely good. A few songs feature guitars (such as the peerless \\"Such Great Heights\\"), and/or drums (on the excellent \\"Clark Gable\\"), and even an accordion (\\"This Place is a Prison\\"). Jimmy Tamberello did an outstanding job programming the beats on the album. He seems to have an excellent feel for creating sounds that make you want to move. Virtually every song on the album will have you tapping your feet, fingers, or any number of appendages. \\"Such Great Heights\\" is the best song I've heard in 2003. It is absolutely infectious. \\"The district sleeps alone tonight\\" is very nearly as good. \\"Give Up\\" is an album that fans of various genres will be able to enjoy equally, and I hope to hear more from this superb collaboration.

0393039765|5.0|Fight Club is a very unique novel. Chuck Palaniuk wrote a very unique novel with Fight Club, the narrator is mysterious, but he tells us about this individual who goes to meetings faking illnesses, and goes across the country until he meet Tyler. Him and Tyler then go to restaurants doing some sick things to soup to high-class people, and yet they both create this club in bars called Fight Club. The first rules of Fight Club, no one talks about Fight Club, the second rules of Fight Club, no one talks about Fight Club, the third rule is two men to a fight and with no shoes and shirts. So the narrator goes along with his life working in this boring office setting, and as Fight Club starts to grow, so does another club involving follwers who make soap and sell it to stores with human fat. Now the narrator meets Helen, one of the people in his groups, Tyler befriends her, and they make love a lot. Now Fight Club is HUGE, and it is national, and the FBI starts to shut down Fight Club in Portland Oregon, but still the men keep on fighting. Now as the book moves along, (sorry I am going to spoil this for everyone, if you dont want to know the ending, then dont read the rest of this review) the narrator starts to see Tyler's followers shaking his hand, and just happy to see him, but he does not know that when he sleeps he is Tyler! Tyler is a split-personality that the narrator has! Now the narrator tries to shut down Fight Club, but to no prevail, and Helen dumps him, and now in his office building, his follwers are burning paper, and throwing office desks and cabinets through the building. Now the narrator has a gun in his mouth, and Helen tries to stop him, but is unlucky. The novel ends with him going to heaven meeting Peter. <br />This is my first Chuck Palahniuk novel, and I loved it from page one. I thought this was the most orginal novel of the last decade. A keeper for this constant reader's library.

B00005A46T|1.0|Slipknot is described in one word-awful. I agree with another reviewer on here where he said that this music isn't heavy, it's just garabage. If you want good heavy metal music check out Black Sabbath, Ozzy, Pantera, Slayer, Black Label Society and Iron Maiden or something like that. All those bands are great, this is just as I said-garbage. <br />PS: one more thing. BANGING RANDOM POWER CHORDS ISN'T MUSIC! IT'S NOISE!
0156711427|4.0|Sadly, &quot;A Passage to India&quot; will probably never seem dated, because the racial and religious problems that plagued India nearly a century ago continue to do so today. That's a testament, though, to just how compelling E.M. Forster's novel was and is.<br />Two English ladies, one young and strong willed and the other her elderly chaperone, visit India with the intent of fully immersing themselves in Indian culture--unlike their compatriots, who segregate themselves from the Indians and relegate them to little more than a slave class. However, during a cave exploration, something inexplicable happens to both of them and they find themselves unhinged from the experience.  What follows is a sad story about the clash of two cultures that form immediate and unshakable assumptions about each other.<br />Forster has been criticized for being somewhat one-sided in his portrayal of the English-Indian conflict, painting the English as belligerent, pompous bullies and the Indians as lovable and continuously wronged. I suppose that criticism is valid to a reader looking for clinical fairness, but as Forster himself is recorded as saying, he was sick of fairness at the time he wrote this novel and composed his story instead from the heart. I can completely understand this sentiment.  In any conflict, when one side is so decidedly dominant and thus has all the advantages, fairness seems like an almost irrelevant concept.  What Forster has done here is fashioned a compelling story populated by perhaps some of the most psychologically complex characters ever put to the page.<br />Which is both good and bad.  On the one hand, fully trying to understand the inner workings of these characters' minds makes for a very interactive reading session.  On the other, Forster makes his characters almost TOO realistically complex, so that I feel that I can't fully understand any of them.  Whether intentional on Forster's part or not, this pretty much works overall for the novel, sinceit is about people who can't fully understand one another.  But I would be lying if I didn't say that it also makes the novel at times somewhat frustrating, and ever so slightly dry.<br />Don't let this criticism overshadow the praise I have for this novel, however.  It's a towering achievement of 20th Century literature and deserves the esteem it has won from the literary community.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I recently purchased this series (having never heard of it before, mind you) after it popped up in my recommendations and got good reviews from viewers.<br />My wife and I were blown away. We watched the &quot;Serenity&quot; episode, then couldn't stop ourselves and watched the next three episodes as well, which led to a very late night. Since then, we've been carefully rationing the remaining episodes and wondering how daily FOX News viewers such as ourselves could be caught unaware of one of the best shows ever aired.<br />It's intelligent, unexpected, humorous, character-driven and imaginative (I know, the death-knell for any network television series). The characters are complex and fully-fleshed. The show may have been too good for network TV, but FOX sure as heck wasn't too good for this show.<br />Despite being nominally a science fiction show, &quot;Firefly&quot; doesn't rely on flashing lights and muppets to give it merit - it relies on top-notch writing and a director who capitalizes on the depth and texture an ensemble cast can bring to a production.<br />Fourteen episodes are too few. I am, however, buoyed by news of work on a movie.
B00005NEZ3|5.0|I was plesently surprised by the lingering after tase of this CD. Imaginative and risky is what this is all about. Thanks for stepping out side of the generic blandness of the modern music scene. Oh yeah and it smells nice too!
B000099T2L|1.0|Unfortunately Amazon does not allow me to give this less than 1 star. Otherwise it would be in the negatives. This is an unusually bad cd. This young gal may want to think about a career as a soft core porn star since it is obvious she has no musical abilities.  This was painful to listen to.
B00018HU4U|2.0|I hate to give a bad review as I think Norah Jones has a wonderful voice, but I found this CD just didn't do it justice. There wasn't nearly enough piano (which is of course the sound we all know her for) it was all guitars, twangy country sounding at times. The first song is good (which is why I gave it two stars instead of one) but I think the rest of it was weak in both sound and lyrics. I'm sure the band is really great, and I know Norah Jones is really great but I just think the two of them together didn't sound that great. I don't think she shouldve changed her sound quite so drastically for this album, maybe kinda ease us into it lol anyhow, thats enough of that, im positive that there will be a lot of people out there who do enjoy this album. If you like jazz and you like the country sounds then maybe this is for you???
B00005JLPK|5.0|I can honestly say that this is one of the better movies out there.  It is not only a synopsis of Frida's life, but also a peak at part of Mexican political and artistic history.  It portrays the life of an artist, and an incredibly couragous woman, who despite many accidents has the perserverance to never give up and be Frida.
B000001FTD|4.0|lemme just say that I grew up listening to most of the major metal bands that have been listed here by the other reviewers.  I loved metal while growing up and I still listen to it, although not regularly.  There is a problem with metal, and that is that most of it is not timeless music.  The lyrics and vocals in almost every heavy metal band sound ridiculous today, and Anthrax is probably the worst offenders of the group.  You play Among the living for anyone under 21 these days and see if they don't laugh in your face, the vocals are so horrible.  And the funniest thing about it is, almost every review on this site is extolling the virtues of belladonna's singing.  He sounds like a clown.  He embodies every terrible stereotype of 80's metal.  I love the music in Among the living.  It has some of the best riffs I've ever heard in my entire life, but it's almost impossible for me to play it unless I'm surrounded by people the same age as me who listened to metal in the 80s, without feeling embarrased.  At least I can still play most metallica, slayer, and pantera without hanging my head in shame.
B000002B7U|5.0|yep you heard me correctly. this is definitely one of the most underrated albums ever. i mean, c'mon whats not to like about this album? ozzy delivers some killer vocals, that are bone-crunching and melodic at the same time, which is hard to do. jake e. lee is an awesome guitarist and pulls off some wild solos. he comes so close to surpassing the great randy rhoads (R.I.P.). then of course the booming baselines of phil soussan and the frantic drumming of randy castillo(R.I.P.) tops it all off perfectly. so what makes this album so perfect you ask? well ozzy managed to combine hard rock with some 80s touches so well (keyboards and such). ITS NOT POP as some reviewers have stupidly put it. its melodic hard rock that borders on glam, but never quite crosses that border.yeah the pictures of the band back then may disgust people nowadays in 2004, but remember this was 1986.look at who was popular then (Bon Jovi,Poison, etc.) hairspray and makeup were \\"in.\\" the pictures are good for laughs now(you aint seen nothing until youve seen ozzy with black eyeliner wearing a coat made of pearls or whatever it is) but you're buying this album for music and you're getting some damn good music here. now read on for the songs:<br />1.The Ultimate Sin-nice drum intro.sort of like a march.then comes such a catchy riff itll be stuck in your head for days. ozzy sings the chorus with a melodic tone to his voice.<br />2.Secret Loser-a faster track.if you think this album is glam, you need to listen to this one more. glam metal just doesn't sound like this. very 80s sounding guitar but a good sound nonetheless. jake's solo is AMAZING. when you hear it, you'll just stare at your stereo at wonder \\"how the f*ck did he do that?\\"why wasn't this song more popular?<br />3.Never Know Why-begins with some eerie distorted guitar sounds, but then BOOM the song just bursts from out of nowhere. lyrically, its basically ozzy giving a big middle finger to everyone who misunderstands him (which is a LOT ofpeople, even to this day)<br />4.Thank God For the Bomb-another hard rock song.ozzy giving off some of his highest-pitched vocals. the chorus is so-so, but its cool when ozzy goes \\"nuke ya nuke ya.\\" another memorable solo from jake. phil's bass roars on this one.<br />5.Never-oh man, another song that deserved more popularity.starts off very fast. some of ozzy's most melodic vocals ever, especially the pre-chorus. and yet another killer solo from jake(why didn't this guy get more well-known?and where does ozzy find these killer guitarists?) some of randy's best drumming.<br />6.Lightning Strikes-one of ozzy's most underrated songs(are you even surprised anymore?)phil makes his bass HEARD on this one. nice keyboard parts during the chorus and good drum performance by randy there.very 80s but very cool.<br />7.Killer of Giants-nice slow beginning.its very slow and soft with ozzy giving some of his best vocals yet. then after about two minutes, the song just lets loose and ozzy just belts out that chorus with such authority.<br />8.Fool Like You-you wanna know what melodic rock is?just listen to this song. very cool guitar sounds in the intro. ozzy gives off more melodic singing and phil's bass going wild.my description doesnt make it sound like rock and roll but it is.<br />9.Shot in the Dark-sadly, the only popular song, but its a good one. at first i thought it was weird that the only popular song was last on the album, but after listening through the album, its a great way to end such a great CD. that being said, this is another song with a melodic intro(very beautiful guitar chords). this is a slow song and the most commercial-sounding, but it rocks. everything here is perfect-ozzy's singing,jake's guitar(especially the solo),phil's bass, and randy's drumming.<br />well there you have it. one of the most under appreciated rock albums of all time. ozzy himself would probably hate me for liking this album, since he doesnt like it, especailly shot in the dark. for some reason he can't stand this album (probably because of his glam look at the time)but because of this, this album did not get a 2002 remaster. and the 1995 remasters are long out of print, which includes this album(hey at least it won't get re-recorded.)i was lucky enough to find a german import after MONTHS of patient searching. it was a tad on the pricey side (sixteen dollars) but i think it was VERY worth it and if you're an ozzy fan with an open mind, you'll agree.<br />so what are you waiting for? go get this album now before its gone forever and the only place it shows up is on eBay.
B00005JMCN|4.0|SEABISCUIT has much too generous a heart for the mean-spirited era in which we live. Sometime's it seems as though films which are less intellectual are consigned to the scrap heap by the arts-page elite, even though these pictures tell a great story beautifully and reflect the highest elements of film art. The fact that Chris Cooper was never nominated for an Oscar for his awesome performance in this film says it all. Sure, the film does not reflect the historical record accurately, and for this reason it might have been retitled.  But there were sufficient elements gleaned from the rest of Seabiscuit's history to justify a film with his name on it.  When you go to the movies or roll a DVD, don't seek absolute historical truth, and above all don't scorn honest emotion. SEABISCUIT is a beautifully produced film.  Well produced, acted, edited and art-directed.  The costumes are awesome. The script is intelligent. Randy Newman's score is predictably lavish and lovely. The cinematography is to die-for. The tension and pacing are appropriate to the tale.  So for all those aspiring Vincent Canby's out there, I say leave it to the master.  We go to the movies to be enthralled, to think and feel and leave this sorry world for awhile.  I loved this movie, and my firends think I'm an intellectual.  Little do they know!
0676973779|5.0|This is definitely up there on my favourites list!! I have been out recommending this book to anyone that will listen. It was very visual and you could almost envision being on the raft too...loved it, loved it, loved it!
630218021X|5.0|Ken Russell is one of the most underrated directors in cinema, and although his later output does not reflect the great potential he possesses, it is his earlier films that showcased his true talents in their unique and controversial style.<BR>Russell was instrumental, along with directors like Lindsay Anderson and Nic Roeg,in giving British cinema its own more subtle version of 'nouvelle vague' in the early 70s.<BR>His great passion for literature and classical music was a constant source of inspiration,from his adaptation of D.H Lawrence's 'Women in Love' his most acclaimed film to date, to his biographies of Elgar,Liszt, Mahler and Tchaikovsky.<BR>The British film establishment along with almost all critics liked nothing better than to dismiss Russell and his films as pompous and over indulgent.Micheal Winner has always had his share of these snide reviews and remarks, but although he is a remarkable socialite and bon vivant, his direction talents can not be  compared to Russell's at all ,thus making the cold shoulder the latter received totally unjustified.<BR>Music Lovers, was one of the first films I ever saw, and it was largely responsible for two main developments in my life, <BR>my love and appreciation of classical music on one hand, and a passion for cinema that remains as strong and vibrant to this day on the other.<BR>It is a biography of this greatest of composers,Tchaikovsky, like nothing you are likely to see..Amadeus was majestic and grand..Beethoven's Immortal Beloved was too polished...Russell in Music Lovers gives us a biography that is troubled, anxious, raw and unashamedly personal.<BR>The crazy camera movements, the use of music both as part of the plot and as a background, the emphasis on an aspect of the great composer's life rarely written about or known:<BR>Russell in Music Lovers was able to show the viewers the human with his failings, successes and indulgences that were behind the creative genius, and the agony, despair as well as joybehind the music.<BR>Critics have slammed the film as an bombastic emphasis on Tchaikovsky's homosexuality, but they did miss the point totally..for I believe Russell was not trying to talk about the composer's sexual orientation, rather more about the demons that haunted him and the confusions and anxiousness that followed him throughout his life, his loves, disappointments, and friendships and from which many masterpieces came to life. <BR>I loved the fact how cleverly Russell uses the music to enhance the drama and the mood of the his film: in a way the music of Tchaikovsky speaks in itself the story of its composer..this Russell I believe understood very well and used it to his benefit.And of course it is safe to say that Richard Chamberlain as the Russian composer gave his best performance to date, while actress turned politician Glenda Jackson who worked with Russell on Women In love,is one of the best actresses in the world, in the Rampling-Dench-Redgrave league, and had she not chosen a different career, I am certain she would have delighted cinema lovers with many more great performances. <BR>The sad fact that Music Lovers is not yet released on DVD just confirms how underrated that great director is. At a time when really awful films get a two disc releases with tons of extras, classic films such as Music Lovers, remain out of stock and out of sight to cinema lovers everywhere to be seen again or rediscovered. It is time to give this film a proper release, and its director the recognition that he truly deserves.
B0000CFW87|1.0|The man has a good voice but the recording is awful! It sounds like he is lost somewhere in the orchrestra. Having listened to many recordings of well known artists I feel that whoever was in charge of this recording should go back to kindergarten and start all over. Anybody want to hear how it should be done I suggest that they buy a Russel Watson album. Now there are real fine recordings.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Concert for George! Forget any whining about Tom Petty's voice, it is remarkable. George's music is recreated to stunning effect and often better than the original versions. Beatles included. What a wonderful deal, two DVD's, including rehearsals, interviews, and alternated angle shots. Nothing left for the bootleggers to mine. The sound quality is second to none, thank you Jeff Lynne. This is the absolute best solo Beatle effort since 1971. Enjoy.
0375751513|5.0|Title of Book: The Picture of Dorian Gray<br />By: Oscar Wilde<br />Reviewed by: M. Poppins<br />Period: 5<br />Basil Hallward painted a picture of his friend, Dorian Gray.  Dorian was about eighteen years old, and everyone said that he was very beautiful.  Lord Henry Wotton (Harry), Basil's friend from Oxford, became Dorian's best friend after they met.  After the picture was finished, Basil gave the picture to Dorian as a present, and Dorian made a wish that he would always be young, and the picture would grow old.  His wish came true.  Whenever he did something bad, the person in the picture would get older.  Dorian's face never changed after the picture was finished.  He never let anyone know about the picture.  One day, Dorian showed Basil the picture and showed him how much the picture was altered.  Dorian then murdered the man by digging a knife behind his ear, stabbing him again and again.  The day after Basil was dead, Dorian made Alan Campbell (one of his former friends) get rid of the body, by blackmailing him.  Dorian then decided that he was going to do. He was going to destroy the picture, because he thought that he was going to be in peace after the picture was gone.  He grabbed the knife that he had used to kill Basil and stabbed the picture with it.  A cry and a crash were heard.  A while later, his coachman and footman went through the windows, up to where Dorian was.  On the wall, there was a picture of Dorian Gray, young and beautiful.  On the ground, there was a man who was wrinkled, withered, and loathsome of visage.  They had to examine the rings for them to recognize who he really was.<br />I liked this book because it was fun and interesting at the same time.  This quote is what made Dorian's wish come true: &quot;...only if it were I who was to be always young, and the picture that would grow old!&quot;  He didn't know that his wish was to come true.  I love when things like that happen!<br />I also disliked the book, because in some parts, it just went on and on about things that I didn't understand.  Also, there was too much philosophy in this book.  This was something that Lord Henry said: &quot;I am afraid that women appreciate cruelty, down-right cruelty, more than anything else.  They have wonderfully primitive instincts.  We have emancipated...&quot;  The quote still goes on.  I think that Lord Henry is too philosophic.<br />My least favorite part of the book was when Dorian was stabbing Basil, because that was too nasty for me.  That is what I hate to hear.st went on and on about things that I didn't understand.  Also, there was too much philosophy in this book.

0375707972|4.0|This is a good book about a boy who falls in love with an older women only to find out she has a very troubled past that is coming back to haunt her.  He never forgets her and can't understand what is going on until he grows up and finds out exactly what is going on.  Tried to avoid spoiling anything in my review.  Try it out I think many will enjoy this book.
B000000OSG|5.0|1991 had many cool cds its the best year in the rock n' roll world but the 2nd relaese from the most dangerouse band in the world GNR ruled the rock n 'roll world till this day this is a most have cd to any and every rock fan in the world this cd displays the best song writing and whats real life like
B0001DI0FI|4.0|4-stars overall, but it is easily one of the best directed movies of the year. It really did gather the tight spaced feel of a warship during the 1800's. The dialogue was annoying, so don't watch for the screenplay. But the set designs, the sound, the editing, and the acting are pretty good. I had some problems with the middle of the film which went a little slow (but so did Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and that was IMO the best picture of 2000). But it picks up at the end with a great battle scene. This isn't a fast paced movie. It takes time to enjoy but its well worth it. 4-stars for the movie. 5-stars for director Peter Weir.
B00005PJ8O|5.0|George C Scott IS Patton.<BR>Never has one perfomance dominated the screen like this and I doubt if if it will ever be repeated.<BR>From the opening &quot;flag&quot; scene to the films end, Scott spellbinds and if ever an oscar was a certainy for a performance, then this was it.<BR>Personally I would have went on hunger strike if he didn't win that year!
B00000I236|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie since the release.  I find the music and the scenery just wonderful.  The action is great and without all of the flash of the movies today.  It is a wonderful movie and I would recommend it for anyone who likes to watch movies.<br />Kevin and Meryl are wonderful together.......I love this movie!!
B00011RPB0|3.0|This is a frustrating film for me.  I LOVE Bill Murray. He always entertains me, no matter how small a part he has in a film.  And again, he is fantastic in this one.  <br />They had a great idea going here.  Yes, two lonely people with insomnia in a strange city who connect.  But they really have no meaningful experiences together.  They hop through a bunch of ecstasy parties with her weird friends.  This alone doesn't work for me. <BR>  'Bob' is clearly in his mid-fifties.   No matter how 'cool' he may be, (even for Bill Murray) he would feel totally out of place with those twirps.  <BR>  I know that they are trying to do an 'artsy','hip' film here (gotta keep up with current hollywood standards), but they had a great idea which to me seemed very undeveloped.  A little bit of storyline would have been good, even if it ain't hip these days.  I got bored watching them do nothing but watch their friends party for what seemed like 40 minutes.  <br />Folks, rent this one first.  There are some priceless Bill Murray moments here, but you're gonna want to fast-forward through some extended periods of monotanous and just plain dull film.
B0000AZJXQ|5.0|This is a very good CD, and I don't think there is any doubt that The Noose is the best song on this album! It's truly a flawless song.  Other favorites of mine are: The Outsider, Blue, and Pet.  Maynard is an amazing vocalist and showcases his talent perfectly in everything that APC and Tool produces.
B00018D44U|4.0|and it does grow on you after multiple listenings. The biggest disappointment was the duet with Dolly Parton. I didn't need to hear the voice of Dolly Parton on a Norah Jones CD; that's just not the style of music I was looking for in this CD purchase. I think I will burn a copy of the CD with just that song removed to make it a more enjoyable and consistent listening experience.
B000089RVX|5.0|Most of us never heard of Evanescence till their true debut in the movie Daredevil featuring \\"Bring Me To Life\\" and \\"My Immortal\\". By those songs alone, the audience made their first and final judgements. Not giving Evanescence a chance is something one should simply just not do. <BR> The band previously put out their debut ablum named \\"Origins\\" on a smaller label. Because it only has 60 copies out, they are precious and if you manage to get your hands on it, your lucky, these things are quite pricey. Cutting to the chase,<BR>with Amy Lee on Vocals, you get a spooky, ethereal voice- very beautiful, and resonating. You HAVE to listen to the demo songs to understand the unexplainable heavenly voice.<br />1) Going Under- 9/10 You've most likely heard this on the radio already or seen the music video. It's about revenge from living in ignorance to long...it's not their spookiest but it hits the right spots. This song has some places in it that really demonstrates her voice. <br />2)Bring Me To Life- 9/10 One of the most overplayed songs on the radio at the time, I say it was overrated and judged to quickly as being \\"rap\\" when this IS the only song with a duet. Guy from the 12 stones has probably messed this song up seeing how I prefer it better when seeing them live without him in it. It's pretty good but...overrated. This song first demonstrates the notes she can hold and the instruments used in the band.<br />3)Everybody's Fool-10/10 Definetly one of my favorites. This song definetly shows how well she can sing in a song about Everybody's Fool, someone who betrayed another (themselves too) and can't live without the lie...\\"Without the mask, where can you Hide, Can't find yourself lost in your lie?\\" <br />4)My Immortal-10/10 One of their best. In this song about a woman loving someone who died as if they were still alive- the suggestion reminds me of the basis of their previous album's song \\"Even In Death\\" although the rhythm, sound, and instruments are used differently. Very emotional, and an easy listen played slowly only on a piano and violins.\\"ive held your hand through all of these years but you still have- all of me\\".<br />5)Haunted- 10/10, Personally my favorite track demonstrating the crazy, spooky, side of Evanescence. Her voice is intriguing and demanding in this song what seems to be about a ghostly rape victim taking revenge on her murder. With lyrics like \\"Hunting you- I can smell you- alive...your heart pounding in my head\\", I know something very strong is about to come with her voice- and it does in variant ghostly screams of revenge.<br />6)Tourniquet- 9/10 This song is very good, and it can get stuck in your head pretty long if you listen to it to often as I did. This song is about commiting suicide. The only thing I didnt like were the christian lyrics about \\"My god, my touriquet, return me to salvation\\", though in interviews, Lee claims this song is tore away from the christian bliefs that if you commit suicide (an ultimate sin) and you beg god for forgiveness, will you go to heaven or hell? Because apparently he forgives all that loves and believes... But...\\"I tried to kill the pain- but only brought more..I lay dying and I am pouring crimson regret and betrayal\\" ...catch you and refuse to surrender you.<br />7) Imaginary- 10/10 Apparently this song is about being crazy.<BR>No normal person would stay \\"In my field of paper flowers, and candy clouds of lullaby, I lie inside myself for hours- and watch my purple skies fly over me\\". Another wonderful track, and demonstrates her notes once again. <br />8)Taking Over Me- 8/10, wasn't that great to remember, and reminds me again of My immortal and even in death. It's a good song if you want to hear her voice demonstrations and more ghostly lyrics but i was pretty below her perfect average.<br />9) Hello- 10/10 Very short compared to her usually long songs but nonetheless flawless. This song is about a dying-dying-dying-dead girl on the playground and her innervoicetrying to wake up a soul that's already left the body. It's one of their greatest and what made me fall in love with Amy's long, soft voice.<br />10)My Last Breath- 10/10, Who wouldn't want to hear a song about their lover dying in their arms, and begging you mentally to not be afraid? Heh, I love it. It's pretty long and has wonderful lyrics. Lyrics like \\"I'll miss the winter, a world of fragile things, look for me in the white forest, hiding in a hollow tree\\" combined with her ethereal voice send shivers down my back. <br />11) Whisper- 10/10 Another incredible song..\\"Fallen angels at my feet, Whispering voices at my ear, Death before my eyes, Lying next to me I fear, She beckons me shall I give in, before my end shall I i begin? Forsaking all I've fallen for I rise to meet the end?\\" Awesome lyrics, Amy's voice at it's most powerful, and includes a background in Latin saying \\"Save me from darkness, Save me from evil\\". Under-rated. Very Nice.
B0001AP12G|5.0|THIS CD IS AMAZING.  KANYE IS ONE OF THE BEST PRODUCERS IF NOT THE BEST IN THE LAND.  I WOULD PUT HIM RIGHT UP THERE WITH DR.DRE AND THE NEPTUNES.  BUT WHAT IMPRESSED ME MORE THAN ANYTHING WAS HIS RAPPING.  HE COMES OF LAID BACK LIKE JAY-Z AND HE ALSO HAS CREATIVE LINES.  THIS CD IS DEFINATELY A CLASSIC AND EVERYONE SHOULD GO BUY IT.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT.  IM SURE THIS IS BETTER FOR KANYE THEN WORKING AT THE GAP.
B000026FOA|4.0|It seems to me that Nick Drake had a a perfect thought.  And that thought tried to leak out in his music.  It leaked in a beautiful manner.  Although this is a wonderfully made album.  Some tracks do become a bit too much, repetative, or odd in some eays.  The introduction; Time Has Told Me, is perfect.  Then thre are several songs such as River Man, Three Hours, and Way to blue, and those are a bit odd, and have too much Bongo.  Day is Done is the true Masterpiece of this album, and Saturday Sun is the true icing on the cake.  I love the Cello, and it is approached in such a beautiful manner.  Way to go.
1563898586|5.0|You don't expect to find a comic that would so justify a complete set of literary footnotes, but that's just what this is.  Stranger still, it's a pulp adventure with literary qualities.  <br />Highly, highly recommended.
0385510438|4.0|I have read all of John Grisham's books.  Some I loved (The Pelican Brief) and some I hated (A Painted House, The Chamber), but all were well written.  The Last Juror is no exception.  <br />Like more recent of Grisham's books, this is more a narrative than a classic who done it.  It is a fast paced, easy read (I finished it in four days).  <br />The climax appears to occur about half way through the story, leaving the reader to wonder what is in store for the last 100 pages or so.  The author doesn't dissapoint, offering an all too real account of life in a small town in the South, adding a small twist at the end wich makes for a fun read.<br />While this book lacks the complexity and intrigue of The Pelican Brief, it is a good read.  Anyone who grew up in a small town will find the story compelling.  You will identify with the characters. <br />I liked it better than The King of Torts, the Bretheren and Run Away Jury which I thought were average efforts for John Grisham.<br />If you like John Grisham, you'll like this one as well.
B000002L99|1.0|&quot;U.S. prime, grade A stamp gauranteed&quot; Those are the opening lyrics to Van Halen's 5150.  If that isn't bad enough, the opening number &quot;Good Enough&quot; is a rewrite of &quot;Panama&quot; from 1984, substituting a much more constipated sounding group.  I struggled to find a way to describe the sound of the new Van Halen as a band on this record - the heavily compressed guitars, the synthetic drums - but this term was the best I could do.<br />Sammy Hagar was a bad choice to replace David Lee Roth, who brought a certain crass intelligence to Van Halen.  Sammy brought nothing to the table but a &quot;good set of pipes&quot; (he is really good at shrill screaming - if you think that's good) and lyric writing skills that would disgrace the bathroom wall in any suburban high school. But all you have to do is look the cover art for this CD versus any of the Roth recordings, and it pretty much tells the whole story.<br />If you can make it through &quot;Dreams&quot; on this album, you are a better man than I.  And you're driving a Trans Am.
B00009V7T2|5.0|Mars Volta are aware of their antecedants without becoming them, and they have soul. Above the fact that this album is technically, referentially and creatively brilliant, it is rock music you can actually feel in your spine. Way to go Omar and Cedric!!
B0000028M7|5.0|A great album through and through, but also in possesion of rock's great \\"side one, track one,\\" a la \\"High Fidelity.\\"  You put the CD in your CD player.  You turn up the volume, 'cause hey, it's Alice In Chains!  You press 'play.'  You will then find yourself in the midst of a violent heavy metal torture session of strange beauty and power.  Hearing that first primal scream, was I surprised to hear that vocalist Layne Staley was hopeless drug addict whose life was filled with psychic pain, who ended up lonely and dead?  Sadly, nope.  An amazing, essential album for all fans of immense, hard rock music.
0517123207|5.0|The cover of this edition is misleading as Darwin only refers to man once in this book. It was in &quot;Descent of Man&quot; that he addressed the subject of evolution in man. That aside, this is a great book. Darwin wrote one of the most readable scientific texts in history. It also happens to be one of the most important science books in all of history. If you have never read a seminal science book before, treat yourself and see what a pleasure it can be.

It's the Park Hyatt.  If you have the means, I highly recommend...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is one of the more original shows that I've seen.  With a well written plot, and a wonderful cast of 9, this show is fresh, imaginative, and somewhat suspenseful.  Don't be fooled by Firefly being called a sci-fi.  While the show has sci-fi elements, it's just as much a western as it is a sci-fi.  <br />To best describe the plot of the show, it's like Han Solo meets the X-Files.  The show is about a crew of smugglers 500 years in the future, but decked out like they're from the old west.  The crew has a paranormal passenger that has them running from men in black type government officials.<br />This show doesn't lack in the special effects department, either, with big budget effects and sets.  In fact, since anyone can see the quality of the show, my guess is that Fox cancelled it largely due to budget concerns.  With the large sets and great effects, not to mention starring cast of 9, the show couldn't have been cheap to produce.<br />If you've got the $30 to spare, and you're looking for a show that is original, tasteful, funny, has great plot development, and great effects, then this is your show.  The only problem with the show is that there are only 14 episodes.  So, once you're done, you're done.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|He came from Cuba as a refugee to the U.S., he did a few little illegal jobs for different purchasers and became the biggest mafia boss in the city (Miami).<br />Al Pacino and his supporting actors do their job so well that you can feel with the characters and put yourself in their place.<BR>The development of the story is every second of the movie very exciting and also realistic.<BR>This movie is also a model for a very good computergame called GTA (grand theft auto) Vice City!<br />In our opinion, the movie and the videogame are fantastic examples for real good entertainment.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|When watching the movie for the first time, I couldn't help but noticing how INCREDIBLY similar the music is to that in the film, Gladiator. Definitely a rip-off, but good, lively fun. And great to exercise to.
B0001ADAVK|3.0|This film was okay. Honestly I've tried to come up with a better word, but I think 'okay' conveys it well. I'll divide my review into good and bad, and as you'll see, the two come out pretty even in the end - like i said: okay. <br />   As other reviewers note - and I can't emphasize enough - this film is NOT simply a revamped \\"Dead Poet's Society\\". Yes, many details are the same: the private school v. the liberationist rebel of a teacher. Beyond that, all comparison is an injustice. This film has a different mood, script and certainly different message. <br />   The acting was another good feature: Julia Stiles, Kirsten Dunst (who steals the show as the student antagonist) Julia Roberts and the others (whom I do not know by name, but if the film is any indication, I will someday). This is truly an ensemble cast with no weak spots and each character/actor supporting the others. <br />   Now to the bad: unfortunately, for all its differences from 'Dead Poets Society\\", this film is still quite cliche. Not so much that you don't want to watch, but just enough where, since you know that you know what will happen, there is absolutely no dramatic tension in the film. And it is not only the main plot that is cliche, but the sub-plots (with the exception of a twist in 'Julia Stiles's' story-line) are too easy to guess at. <br />   Now for the big flaw - the fatal flaw without which the film would've squeezed four stars out of me. The message of the main story line - the struggle for 'traditional Wellsley women' to liberate from the social roles alloted them - no matter how noble, was simply overdone. Of course, the message is a damn good one, but seemed to me that it was so 'in your face' through the whole film, that any depth the film could have had was suffocated by it.<br />Okay: yes I am a male who, in 1950, was twenty years away from even being an idea in my parents minds. I am aware that my perspective might be checkered. But it has been confirmed by EVERY SINGLE person I know of the appropriate age who has seen the film. Not to deny that things were bad and that this film shows those things well. But - let me put it in the words of my mother - in the movie, there is not a single male character who does not have a major character flaw, and in reality, things just weren't that black and white. Basically, the problem is that the film is just too black and white and because of that, you find yourself saying: \\"Enough already. I get the point.\\"<br />So there you have it: okay. To put it another way, I liked it enough to consider spending the money for the DVD; I just probably won't watch this one as much as some of my others.
0792844882|2.0|There are many movies that come along which critics feel compelled to call an \\"instant camp classic\\".  Unfortunately, they are simply bad movies for the most part.  \\"Showgirls\\" is another story.  A wonderfully tawdry, overproduced, overacted spectacle featuring a goddess of over the top performing, Elizabeth Berkley. She attacks this glitzy trash as if an Oscar nomination were just within her reach. Gina Gershon and the rest of the cast give this beautiful mistake of a movie the aura of pornographic glamour that only big budget Hollywood could provide.  Immensely entertaining, and more fascinating each time I view it.  If you're ever feeling depressed, or simply down in the dumps, just watch Ms. Berkley sniff her sad little sniff in what is perhaps my favorite scene.  Don't let this movie pass you by simply because it has been labeled \\"bad\\".  This is \\"bad\\" as high art.
B0001611DI|5.0|This movie truly terrified me the first time I saw it. Something about the whole concept of the dead returning to life to hunt the living is very frightening. Yes, the movie may be corny considering how small of a budget it had and since it's 25 years old, but the point gets across. It's based around a sort of end of the world phenomenon involving thousands of the dead returning to life and walking the earth. As the world plunges into chaos, four survivors barricade themselves into a shopping mall surrounded by hundreds of the living dead. At first all is good, but things begin to grow wrong which results in a very scary and absolutely grusome finale. <br />I can't say that I recommend watching this alone. And if u were scared to death by this one, I also recommend \\"Day of the Dead\\" which together with this, will ensure that you never sleep again.

B0000WN0ZK|5.0|I have always thought this film was a masterpiece until I saw it the other day on DVD and now I think it's a total mega masterpiece by a total god!<BR>If you ever wondered if DVD was worth getting then compare this to the VHS version. There is no comparison.<BR>In brief this is about David Hemmings running around London in Jimmy Savilles Roller in May 1966 looking cool and taking photos.<BR>This film is about style not content.<BR>The colour in the film and the depth is amazing.Watch out for the photo shoot with the models and look at the reflextions, it's almost 3D.<BR>Also it's in W/S and not 4:3 and you at last get to see what Michelangelo Antonioni wanted you to see and this also has a dramatic effect on the sum total of this movie.This is certainly true of the trip to Maryon Wilson park where 'Thomas' photos 'Jane' and her lover who in 'Thomas's' words 'is a bit past it'. <BR>The extras are fine but this version is slighly longer than the VHS version which is the best part about it. Watch out for the man who appears out of nowhere when 'Thomas' sounds of his horn in Holland park.The sound is fine but two main back ground noises have been removed, I leave you to work that one out. This may have never been there in the first place in the USA version so will be interesting to see what becomes of it in the UK DVD which is out in April.<BR>All in all this is a fitting tribute to the late great David Hemmings who sadly died last year aged 62.
0385510438|4.0|This book is a great one.  A really interesting read.  As a boy who was born in 83, it's really interesting to dive into the segregated world of the early 70's and see life on both sides of the track.<br />This book is more or less about corruption.  Corruption of politics, corruption of justice, corruption of the mind.  Every character seems to have enough depth to have an entire book written about just them.  With this in mind, trying to predict how the book will end will drive you nuts.  The suprise ending had me, litterally, gasp out loud.  When the moment clicks in your mind, you'll look back on the book and wonder how you didn't figure it out earlier.<br />All in all, this is a fun read.  I was able to crank this bad boy out in just under a week; i just couldn't seem to let the book sit on the table.<br />I must say, I'm a huge John Grisham fan to begin with, so my review may be a bit biased.  Buut anyone who doesn't feal their heart strings tug at the end of this book must be made of ice.  Don't expect the thrilling, chapter after chapter of suspense.  This book is a great story and, for lack of a better way to describe it, just feels real.<br />In short, i loved it, you should buy it.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Lost in Translation<br />I have watched this film both in the theater and dvd and I like this movie better now than I did at the theater, and I liked it at the theater allot.<BR>This film just shows me what can be done, when a smart director takes her time to develop characters which we learn to care about. Lets face it, this film is not about much. Two people stuck in a hotel in the urban sprawl of Tokyo, isolated by language and their lives. Two people who, under normal circumstances would never meet and have little in common. Yet they connect and share a few moments in their lives that they shall take with them the rest of their days. <BR>This film is smart. Very smart because again it is really about very little and yet it kept my attention to the very last second. Bill Murray is wonderful. He never over plays this roll, not for a moment. Just when you think he may take it too fare he reals himself in and stays in character. He is funny at times, but conveys a man very tired with his life and his place in it.<BR>Scarlet Johnasson is great. A star in the making. The chemistry is there between her and Murray even though there must be 30 plus years difference in their ages. <BR>I liked the fact that unlike most Hollywood films they never end up hooking up in bed. That would have been to common and this was not a common film. We feel the characters much more so when they do not get together in any sexual way. It was almost as if the characters were too special to sleep together(for sex) and that helped lift the acting and the film above the common love story churned out these days. <BR>But to me the best and most outstanding moment is the end when Murray chases Johnasson down on the Tokyo street and you realize in that final meeting together how special he thinks she is. I am glad we do not hear what they say to each other. But I can only guess it would be something touching, and sincere just as this film was. <BR>Lost in Translation is a film for those who have felt <BR>lonely in a crowd of people ,and yet found something up lifting to carry them over the emptiness. A wonderful movie.

B000096FUD|4.0|At face value, this film claims status as a \\"docudrama,\\" and proposes to reveal to it's audience the making and undoing of the movie, \\"The Man Who Killed Don Quixote.\\"  We are treated to a behind-the-scenes look at the \\"Murphy's Law\\" aspect of movie making, the bureaucracy, and the mahem.  But.....<BR>I have long admired the work of Terry Gilliam as well as the man himself.  He is the kind of iconoclast that the world needs more of, the kind of dreamer that wakes us up, and someone with just enough demons to bring all the so-called \\"angels\\" down a rung or two.  <BR>However, in acknowledging who the man Terry Gilliam is, I have to reserve some suspicion about the \\"real reality\\" of this docudrama.  Excuse the equivocation, but it's only appropriate considering my suspicions about the film.  When you consider that Gilliam is a fan of Cervantes's Don Quixote, and then you consider that Cervantes became a party to his own fiction in Quixote, (inventing Benengali, the fictional original historian of the fictional \\"real\\" Quixote) and - then - you consider the man Terry Gilliam, you must then consider the liklihood that \\"Lost in La Mancha\\" is Gilliam's own \\"Benengali.\\"  What I mean by this is that it's quite possible that Gilliam has produced \\"Lost in La Mancha\\" to make a statement about Hollywood bureaucracy in the same way the Cervantes used Benengali to make a statement about plagiarism and literature.  I know this may sound confusing, especially to those unfamiliar with Cerventes's Quixote.  But it really does make sense when you acknowledge Gilliam's disdain for Hollywood bureaucracy and his iconoclastic ideals.  There is also the more than coincidental similarity between Lost in La Mancha's six days of filming and Quixote's six day illness and seventh day return to sanity.    <BR>So, if you take Lost in La Mancha at face value, it's a fun, fly-on-the-wall adventure about a misadventure Hollywood style.  It leaves the business of making motion pictures naked, and infuses a respect for filmmakers like Gilliam.  But, if you suspect as I do that Lost in La Mancha is Gilliam's own Benengali, then you will find the message in this film and the true genius of Gilliam.
0553579908|5.0|This is a big book, took me a couple months to finish. Worth every minute. Pretty great!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I was sceptical when I first heard that Sofia Coppola, the daughter of director Francis Ford Coppola, wanted to become a director. This seemed to be carrying even Hollywood nepotism way too far. <br />I'm happy to say that Sofia Coppola completely overcame my scepticism with her first film: \\"The Virgin Suicides\\". Now, with \\"Lost in Translation\\" she's made a film so full of charm and observation that I just can't wait to see what she's going to do next. <br />Although \\"Lost in Translation\\" stars Bill Murray, it's not one of his mainstream comedies but an - often humorous - offbeat love story, or friendship story, or lost soul story. It's the fact that you end up not quite sure which that is a major part of its charm.<br />Sofia Coppola's script is fairly minimalist, leaving plenty of room for Bill Murray and Scarlett Johanssen to develop their characters' relationships through looks, gestures, moments of silence. And then there are the added complications. Murray's character Bob Harris is facing a mid-life crisis. Johanssen's Charlotte is in her early to mid-twenties. Both are married.<br />Bob is a slightly over the hill actor who - he tells Charlotte - could be at home doing a play but is in Tokyo to do an ad for whisky for 2 million dollars. Charlotte is the wife of a fashion photographer (played by Giovanni Ribisi) who's in town to do a shoot. Charlotte's been married two years, and is beginning to think she doesn't really know who her husband is. Bob has been married for 25 years and it's a marriage that seems to exist for the sake of the children. During their cross world phone calls neither he nor his wife seem to be very open with one another emotionally. <br />Both characters are jet-lagged and suffering from insomnia. In the early hours of the morning they find themselves sitting next to one another in the hotel bar, and they begin to get to know one another, something that probably would not have happened had they not been adrift, strangers in a strange land. <br />And to them at least Tokyo is a strange land. Charlotte feels the alienation of the outsider. Bob's cultural collisions are somewhat more amusing. Some, most notably a session shooting photographs for the whiskey campaign, are ad-libbed by Murray and the Japanese cast. In another scene a Japanese prostitute sent to his room by his gracious hosts won't take no for an answer, and seems determined that he should lick her tights or lip her tights. It takes him a while to catch on.<br />Film-makers sometimes don't do so well when they are visiting another culture. Even a mostly observant director like Wim Wenders can find him or herself coming over as a cultural tourist, as Wenders did in \\"Tokyo-Ga\\". <br />Coppola and her cameraman Lance Acord, take us through a similar landscape, of pachinko parlours, video game arcades, and karaoke bars, but they're less overwhelmed with the environment and a bit more willing to draw satire from it. A Japanese character nicknamed Charlie Brown singing the Sex Pistols \\"God Save the Queen\\" in a karaoke bar, does - after all - have potentially humorous overtones. And the film's not any less satirical in its portrayal of many of the Western characters, including a Western lady jazz singer in the hotel bar, a Hollywood actress in Japan to promote an action movie in which she co-starred with Keanu Reeves, or even Bob himself. One encounter between Bob and the jazz singer, and its after-effects, are simultaneously stinging, funny and poignant. <br />Bob stays in Tokyo a few extra days to appear on an absurd TV chat show. Charlotte is left alone as her husband leaves town for a shoot. They begin to hang out together. They begin to realise that despite the age difference, and their different places in life they are experiencing very similar self-doubts. And they like each other. A lot. But where are they going to go with it? I'm not going to give much of that away, but it's an extremely sensitive portrayal of a budding relationship between what is - in some ways only - an odd couple. <br />Sofia Coppola's casting is inspired. The origin of the film was the city of Tokyo itself, which Coppola felt she wanted to put on screen, But once she'd decided that she began to look for characters and - from the beginning - had Murray in mind. In \\"Lost in Translation\\" Murray gives free rein to both his comic ability and his sensitivity.<br />Cast opposite him, Scarlet Johansen is about five years younger than the character she's playing. She's not yet even twenty, but she is already more than able to suggest a level of complexity far beyond her years. <br />Much the same statement also applies to director and screenwriter Sofia Coppola. Some have been sceptical about how someone so young could get into the head of a middle aged guy having a mid-life crisis. It doesn't surprise me so much. Coppola clearly possesses the art, insight and sensitivity to do it. And the only criticism I have about \\"Lost in Translation\\" is that it's all over way too fast.
B00005JLK1|4.0|Best:<br />1) It was scary and unpredictable. If you examine the whole story, it's pretty packed even though it plays very simply.<BR>2) They did a lot with practical special-effects without resorting to many cgi graphics.<BR>3) The opening gore scene is very memorable and something you'll want to replay over and over.<BR>4) You get good acting from well-chosen star talent.<BR>3) There are a few worthwhile behind-the-scenes shows that augment the movie well.<br />Worst:<br />1) The hip-hop music track was completely inappropriate at times (especially when they were flashing back to the 1962 scenes).<BR>2) The story is a little hard to understand, so you might have to rewatch it to really get it all.<br />Recommendation:<br />This is Halloween great that you can easily watch once a year and notice something new each time. It's got suspense, ghosts and lots of bloody deaths (that weren't overdone) - what's not to love.
B00018D44U|4.0|Anticipating a potentially different sound from Come Away With Me, with my first listen to Feels Like Home I tried to remain open-minded.  I was not disappointed.  The sound is lighter in places, seems to have more folk influences in others, and there is still country-blues.  Not being familiar with any of the tracks before my first listen, I've found that each time I play it, with the sounds becoming more familiar, it has become just as personal and inventive as her previous CD.
B0000VAFO0|1.0|I saw this movie at the theater and was pretty disappointed. It looked interesting, lots of action, maybe some romance.  Instead, it was a gorgeously shot boring movie. My husband, a former comic book geek, absolutely hated it and almost fell asleep during the predictable, often nonsensical story. Also, some of the myths about vampires are blatantly disregarded without explanation, like why these vampires can see their reflections in mirrors. The costumes, set, and cinematography were great, but I would never buy this movie, or even tape it off cable TV.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This album is, and will continue to be, my all time favorite. Every track is solid. Their opening song-cochise, bring me into the mood of the album immediately. Very catchy. Gasoline isn't that catchy, but the lyrics are top-notch. What you are and Like a Stone are solid tracks that present deep and thoughtful lyrics. Shadow of the sun, exploder and getaway car are solid tracks.<br />The best track in the album is no doubt &quot;I am the highway&quot;. Solid and catchy tune throughout the whole song. I find this song to be really addictive and it stayed in my stereo for a long time.<br />All in all, this album presents over 1 hour of solid music, and it's worth every cent of its price.
B00018D44U|5.0|This album, although not abundant with songs that could be perceived as &quot;hits&quot; like [shoot the moon] and [come away with me], is reminiscent of the songs in the first album that took less radio hoopla but were much more laid back and relaxing to me, namely, [turn me on] and [the long day is over]..<br />i would like to raise my thumbs, but i'm just too relaxed in my hamac for that..
B00003CXA4|5.0|\\"Gandhi\\" is one of those movies where everything seems to be perfect. The main character, Mohandas K. Gandhi is one of the most important historical figures, and he deserved a movie that made justice to his legend and greatness. In 1982, Richard Attenborough made a beautiful film that without a doubt, made that thousands of people admire Mohandas K. Gandhi.<br />Ben Kingsley's performance is one of the most impressive that I have ever seen, thanks to a low-key and spiritual portrait of Gandhi, Ben Kingsley is now known as an excellent actor. There are few main characters, most of them are supporting characters, but the performances are equally impressive.<br />The cinematography is flawless: the photography, the costumes, the production design and the direction are outstanding. For those that haven't seen \\"Gandhi\\", this movie did for Mohandas K. Gandhi the same thing that \\"Schindler's List\\" did for Oskar Schindler in 1993, thanks to these movies a lot of people were interested in these historical men.<br />Definitely \\"Gandhi\\" is one of the best films ever made, it's a work of art, the homage that Mohandas K. Gandhi deserved.
038572179X|5.0|If you are the sort of reader whose interest is held primarily by event-driven plots, you will find much of this novel nearly intolerable.    I, however, enjoy the work of writers who, with precise observations and elegant prose, can render characters through the flow of their thoughts. Ian McEwan is such a writer. In ATONEMENT he succeeds in getting into the heads of a variety of characters, which is essential in showing us how a series of misunderstandings can escalate into a tragedy.    I bought the book because it had been so highly praised by critics, but I postponed reading it, thinking, why should I care about THESE people--these upper middle class Brits? Initially, as I began to read, my attitude remained unchanged. But the often-annoying 13-year-old Briony brought me an uncomfortable reminder of some of my own childhood ambitions, misunderstandings and cruelties. And the writing was so fluid. I was gradually drawn in. So at that moment when the cleaning woman's son Robbie realizes his dreadful error, I was hit with the force of a slap. \\"OH NO,\\" I thought, and rapidly devoured the rest of the book, anxious to learn what becomes of the promising young man.    The second part of the book is likely to interest all readers. It is set during WWII, and Robbie takes center stage. We read his tumbling reflections and observations during the chaotic withdrawal of the British army to Dunkirk. (I was reminded of parts of the movie \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\") Robbie's hopeful musings are undercut by a mounting dread at his dangerous predicament. But what ultimately happens to him? One must read on.    Briony's life as a young woman--a nurse in training--dominates part three, which takes place in wartime London before the blitz. She hopes to establish a writing career one day, but for the time prefers to lose herself in the demands of her job. She is haunted by her past actions. How can she atone for them?    The answer is gracefully explored in the heart-rending and thoughtful epilogue. For Briony, atonement is incomplete, but through writing is able to bring some comfort to herself--and to readers as well.

This movie is one of her best and I'm looking foreward to it's release just like I'm looking foreward to the other titles among Miss Garland's movies that are also going to be released on DVD in April and May.  I'm sure that many other people agree with me that many of these great titles should all be released on DVD.
B00005JL7Q|4.0|I think the movie is very good and touching that most people would enjoy. At the same time, it fulled of cliches. Great material (it is based on Nick Hornby book), good work of directors and acting compensate and make the difference. I thought I wouldn't be able to stand one more Hugh Grant appearance that is so familiar from many other his movies. But somehow this movie makes me forget about other similar acting gigs by Grant. The movie leaves yoou with a very nice a warm feelings and what else can you ask from romantic comedy - hard to believe that the same directors (Paul &amp; Chris Weitz) did 'American Pie'.

0385512104|5.0|Mark Haddon has written a moving novel about love and bravery through the eyes of a British autistic boy.  Christopher discovers his neighbor's poodle dead, impaled by a pitchfork, and, because he adores puzzles, he sets out to solve the mystery of who killed Wellington .  But Christopher is autistic, a boy who doesn't like to be touched and cannot decipher emotions beyond the tools his teacher has taught him, and so the task requires the huge effort of testing rules and facing his own fears.  A literalist by neurology, he deconstructs life into a set of mathematical equations and physical laws.  This unique perspective makes him a good detective on one level, where clues and logic rule, but it also fails him on another, higher one because he cannot understand the magnitude of what he uncovers.<br />That Haddon was able to write a book from Christopher's point of view with all his quirks and still make him lovable is extraordinary.  By necessity, the writing is simple and unadorned, but the language of details elevates it from the mundane.  The insertion of mathematical puzzles and drawings add to the reader's understanding of how Christopher's mind works.  Haddon's real skill is an understatement that allows the reader to comprehend what is going on even if Christopher cannot.  Although Christopher cannot grasp subtlety and nuances, the reader can, and that's where the true force of this exceptional novel lies.<br />This short, easy to read book can be completed in a couple of sittings, although its impact will last much longer. Highly recommended for a general readership.
B00018D37I|4.0|One Night With Blue Note: The Historic All-Star Reunion Concert.<br /> This was such an historic concert and one of the few opportunities to see the classic Blue Note musicians playing together on video. It's a shame that it was clumsily reedited and we are denied fine performance that should have been included in a second volume.<br /> I collect jazz, blues and roots music videos and this has always been one of my very favorite jazz videos. It was amazingly well performed, edited into videos for the time with a fade to a blue image of Stanley Turrentine playing on the stairs, included a riveting three-song mini-concert with Charles Lloyd and his classic quartet with the late Michel Petrucianni sitting in Keith Jarrett's piano chair, and many highly memorable moments.<br /> Steven Reed, the producer of this release and Michael Cuscuna of Blue Note has chosen to edit out some of the finest moments of the concert (including two of the three Charles Lloyd songs), change the expertly-edited sequences in a vain effort to show the audience (usually behind a intrusive camera man, an awkward and distracting choice) and substitute some new footage. The new footage (Record-Me, Appointment in Ghana, The Jumpin' Blues and Scratch My Back) is welcome but the missing footage, When You Wish Upon A Star by Stanley Jordan, Broadside by Bennie Wallace, Passion Dance  with McCoy Tyner and Jackie McLean and the full Charles Lloyd concert (featuring his comeback band) including The Blessing and Lady Day is missed. All are available on the laser disk and VHS versions.<br />I guess that we should be thankful that he included a full two hours of music but would a second disc with an additional hour be asking too much? Then, of course, there are the additional audio recordings on the three-disk set issued on Blue Note.

Also highly recommended as a starter for those uninitiated to that mythical late 60s, first-half 70s era.  For those a little too young to have participated first-hand, perhaps it will conjure those pre-teen memories of longer hair, junkier cars, cool older neighbor kids (and those great record collections!).  And especially those summertime get-togethers at sundown (with the requisite Pabst, acoustic playing, herbs and mosquitos).<br />But I digress - just buy it!  Close eyes, and be transported to '71.  (Or postwar '74, if you prefer)
B0000VAFO0|2.0|Seeing the trailer many times before the movie came out, it looked like one of the strongest movies in atmosphere in past couple of years. When seeing the movie, I was disappointed to such a high extent. Very limited in action, and attempted to be philisophically strong but just proved it redundant. This movie was easily the biggest disappointment in 2003. If you didn't see it, I highly advise it stay that way and watch something like Freddy vs. Jason or 28 Days Later (better horror movies in 2003).
B00018D44U|4.0|\\"Feels Like Home\\" Norah Jones' follow up to her critically acclaimed debut album \\"Come Away with Me\\" in now available in stores. And, in my opinion, it shouldn't take long for this work to achieve its own level of success.<br />  Once again, Norah leads her listeners into a soothing calm. It's like being right there sitting in a smoke filled, dimly lit, piano bar as soon as her vocals reach your ears. Her not quite smooth, yet not quite rough voice is perfectly suited for the lounge scene.<br />  The songs, \\"Those Sweet Words,\\" \\"Carnival Town,\\" \\"Be Here to Love Me,\\" \\"Toes,\\" \\"The Prettiest Thing,\\" and \\"Don't Miss You at All\\" seem to follow in Jones' familiar Jazzy style. Each possess that sweet relaxing element that helped to propel her to the forefront of a pop dominated music industry.<br />  Despite the similarities to the first album, Jones' second work seems slightly more adventurous. Most of the songs, such as \\"What am I to You?\\" and \\"In the Morning\\" are a little more upbeat. In some cases, an expanded array of instruments are used as well. The biggest stretches for Jones are probably \\"Cleepin' In\\" a very country sounding duet with music legend Dolly Parton and \\"Above Ground\\" and \\"The Long Way Home\\" which feature some country/folk and rock based elements respectively.<br />  Overall, \\"Feels Like Home\\" is very much on par with her previous album. With the combination of her sultry vocals, calming piano ability and the captivating and almost spiritual lyrical content, Norah fans will not be disappointed.
B00009RDG9|5.0|I loved &quot;The Hunted.&quot; I thought that it was a brilliant, suspenseful, excellant action film. It was bloody, but not nearly as bloody as &quot;Kill Bill Volume One.&quot; I liked the way the killer killed. He used his hunting knife, and during the film, as a viewer, I could feel the way the future victiums felt. They didn't know that they were about to be killed, but they were scared. The two stars in &quot;The Hunted&quot; are Tommy Lee Jones and Benecio del Toro, and they were perfect in their roles. <br />When the film begins we meet Aaron Hallam, who is a soldier in a war battle in Kosovo. He witnesses explosions, burning buildings, and people shooting each other. Finally he stabs somebody in the throat, and we flash to a different scene. We then meet L.T. Bonham(Tommy Lee Jones) who is a retired military trainer. He is called back into action when a former trainee of his-Aaron Hallam-goes on a murder spree in Oregon. During his battle in Kosovo, he finally snapped, and becomes the very dangerous killer of four men. L.T. arrives at the lastest murder scene in the woods. He meets Abby Durrell, the agent working on the case, and he sees dozens of other agents looking around the scene of the crime. He likes working alone, and meets him in the woods, while looking around. He brings Aaron back with him, but while being transported to another location, he somehow mananges to escape. When L.T finds out about that he become determined to find him or kill him, because he is still very dangerous. Turns out, Aaron went to see his ex-girlfriend Irene Kravitz, and her daughter Loretta, Aaron and L.T. ensure a cat and mouse game, with either one of them being the cat or the mouse. <br />A main reason who I loved &quot;The Hunted&quot; so much was because it was a fun cat and mouse chase. The ending was also surprising, because whatever happened at the end, I thought that it was going to happen the other way. I didn't think that it would stick to formula, but it did.Kudos to Tommy Lee Jones. He once again mananges to give a great performance, and Benecio del Toro I don't really like, but he also mananged to be good in this film. It is not a film for everybody. It does have some very bloody scenes, especially the knife fight towards the end, but overall the film works very well. I only wish that I didn't miss this in the theatre. It would probally have been much better there.<br />ENJOY!<br />Rated R for strong bloody violence and some language.
B00011RPB0|1.0|This film was produced for those of you who may have trouble sleeping. I  usually enjoy offbeat films, and liked some of Bill Murray's comedy features, but this movie has nothing to offer except a cool soundtrack and some neat shots of Tokyo. Numerous scenes of the Murray character in the hotel bar set the tone for this mostly monotonous film.<BR> If you can swallow the implausible premise that a young, hip chick in Tokyo would be attracted to the lunkish, sullen Murray, then you may enjoy this. I kept wondering when something interesting or humorous was going to happen - nada<BR>Its a soundtrack with a half baked movie attached. The point? maybe that lonliness makes young girls pine for unattractive older men who hang out in hotel bars. This would be a good way to cleanse the palate if you've been watching too many Hollywood action films,otherwise stay away. One star for Scarlett Johansson though, - a pleasure to watch and a darn good young actress.
0783229526|5.0|I was searching Johnny Depp movies, came across Fear and Loathing, and could not help but to do a review on it. Absolutely one of the best movies I have ever seen. Benicio Del Toro and Johnny Depp give such incredible performances, that if you showed this movie to someone without telling them who is in it, they would probably never guess Depp and Del Toro. The 2 play off each other amazingly. The movie is a lot of fun to watch with a friend and laugh out loud at. I can honestly say that I relate to some of the things they do in this movie, and watching them portray it brings back the memories o so vividly. If you are a Depp fan, watch this movie. If you are a Del Toro fan, watch this movie. If you are a Hunter Thompson fan, watch this movie. In fact, if you have either eyes or ears on your head, and any sense of humor at all, I recommend you watch Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas.
B000068GA4|5.0|Not many musicians have career peaks that last more than fifteen years.  Glenn Danzig may be the only musician to consistently put out great albums for such a long period of time.  From the very first Misfits album through Samhain to Danzig 4, Danzig has buried the competition.  After \\"Lucifuge\\", Glenn Danzig finally began to slow down.  <BR>Glenn Danzig made the cross over with a fifty/fifty hardcore  metal blend in the mid-eighties with his band Samhain.  His next project, Danzig, was 98%  metal.<BR>Danzig's debt album was very good with plenty of catchy guitar hooks, but it still seemed undeveloped.  On \\"Lucifuge\\", he hit full stride.<BR>People say Danzig's voice is a cross between Elvis Presley and Jim Morrison.  His voice is way too unique to be classified and any comparison to past vocalists doesn't do justice.  <BR> There has never been a more sinister sounding recording.  Even Black Sabbath could not be darker.  It's not just the Satanic theme in the lyrics.  The music is like  razor sharp teeth.  The Blues influence meets sludgy thrash type riffs.  In parts it crawls, then howls, then flies off.  Whether it's the type of distortion on the guitars or the slow, heavy bass lines, every single piece of sound makes this album seem as dark as possible.  This is the audio equivalent of \\"The Exorcist\\" and \\"Rosemary's Baby\\".<BR>\\"Long Way Back From Hell\\" begins with ringing and screaming guitars that feel like a descent into hell, the vocals serve as a warning, and Danzig's voice is absolutely flawless.  \\"Snakes Of Christ\\"guitars saw through the soul.  \\"Killer Wolf\\" showcases Danzig's vocals perfectly.  \\"Tired Of Being Alive\\" ups the tempo and rises up during the chorus to unbelievable heights.  \\"I'm The One\\" is like a folk-blues classic straight from the swamps of Louisiana.  \\"Her Black Wings\\" may be the best vocal performance of Danzig's whole career with extremely heavy music backing it up.  \\"Devil's Plaything\\" is where the album really gets interesting.  The songstarts of with a really delicate sounding guitar, then gets crushed by wicked music that kicks in like a raging fire.  \\"777&quot; guitars are scorching; rising from single slow riffs into a complete musical assault.  \\"Blood And Tears\\" is like some fifties heartbreak song with the Satanic church organ player providing part of the background music.  \\"Girl\\" has menacing vibes to it which makes the romantic theme seem a bit twisted.  \\"Pain In The World\\" is the definition of a gloomy song that crawls and bites like a snake.<BR>\\"Lucifuge\\" is a very beautiful album.  Christians will more than likely be afraid of this album.  People who're agnostic, but not really sure about dark powers, this album will make them decide how they feel.  It takes a certain type of bravery to listen to the album.  It takes a little bit of insanity to let it carry you away like it will.
B0000DCGT5|3.0|\\"American Wedding\\" was not as good as many people said it was. It was basically just the same old story. It was also ridden with gross humor, profanity, and crude humor. I'm not saying that those are bad thing, but it just didn't work in this film. It wasn't a bad movie, but it wasn't a good one. I have mixed thoughts on this one. \\"American Wedding\\" is part three in the American Pie movie seris, but it was weak. It didn't have the entire same cast, and most of the laughs come from Eugene Levy, who is the hilarious guy from \\"Bringing Down the House.\\" He reprises his role from the previous films, and he is most of the comedy in the movie. <br />When the film starts, we see main character Jim, and his girlfriend Michelle. They have known each other for several years, and Jim proposes fresh out of collage, and she says \\"yes.\\" Jim's parents are thrilled that their son is finally getting married. Jim's first problem is that he has to decide from his two best friends, Finch and Kevin, which one is going to be his best man. They both know that it is not going to be Stifler, a person who went to high school with them, and who is not liked by everyone else. Jim and Michelle don't even invite him to the wedding, for fear that his continuious profanity, and rude ways would ruin the event. But Stifler somehow gets Jim's parents to invite him to the wedding, and finally Jim allows him to plan the bachlor party. Michelle's parents Harold and Mary arive, as does her sister Candence, who both Finch and Stifer both set their eyes on. All in all, everybody is excited about the event, except Jim's grandmother who objects to the wedding because of Michelle not being Jewish, but the main thing on Jim and Michelle's mind is that they could get married without a hitch.<br />A main problem with \\"American Wedding\\" is that Stifler was unjustifly mean. It seemed that the only reason for him being in the movie is for him to ruin the wedding. There were a few funny parts in the movie-for examplethe scenes where Jim tries to learn how to dance for his wedding, or some of the things Stifler does throughout the film. Take this one scene where Stifler lost the best man ring when the dog eats it. He waits for it to come out of the other end, but when he goes off to clean it, somebody else mistakes it for some kind of a chocolate candy. I'm sure you could picture the rest. It was gross, but it was funny. \\"American Wedding\\" cannot be called a classic, but I guess it is worth the hour and a half that it takes. I have mixed feelings, and I didn't really care for it that much, but it was ok.<br />ENJOY!<br />Rated R for sexual content, language and crude humor.
B00018D44U|5.0|When Norah Jones hit paydirt with her 2002 debut Come Away With Me, the album turned her from a struggling jazz singer into a crossover sensation. That last album went to #1, won many Grammies and proved that you didn't have to be scantily clad to sell records, unlike Skankney Fears. Justin Timberlake's Fan is WRONG AGAIN as usual! Music is not all about beats or dance songs, it's about talent and Norah has that and much more. Songs that are good are Sunrise, the Tom Waits tune The Long Way Home and the duet with Dolly Parton Creepin In. Plus it features Levon Helm and Garth Hudson from The Band. The Beatles are the most important group ever! The new Janet Jackson is gonna flop Justin or shall I say Cranky ol' boy. Ignore that joker and buy the new Norah Jones disc.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin is amazing this cd is so good, this is one of the greatest cds i own and i never take it out of my cd player.
0684874350|5.0|Angelas Ashes is one of the best books I have ever read. It is a very fantastic novel about Frank McCourts childhood in Ireland. Frank McCourt writes as if hes still a child. The reader feels with the little Frank. Sometimes the reader laughs about a funny scene and two minutes later he cries about the poor circumstances Frank lives in. So the novel evokes strong emotional feelings at the reader. To sum up : Its a must to read the book.You wont regret it.
B000001GPW|4.0|Maybe I'm being too critical, but I'm trying find a CD that competes with the recordings by Vladimir Ashkenazy and The London Philharmonic (conducted by Sir Georg Solti).<br />This disc falls short.  While the piano parts are played extremely well, the orchestra is not prominent enough in the mix.<br />At first I was annoyed by the slow tempos at the beginning of the finale of concertos one and three,<br />but they are not as bad as some other versions I have.<br />I just wish the orchestra were a little louder.
B0000CFW87|1.0|Hey everyone, I am very mad at Josh Groban and his new CD.  I was looking forward to listening to it when i bought it and when I played it for the first time i realized that this CD is not worth it.  He is off key, sings in Italian (this is America speak English) and is SOOOO ugly.  His hair looks like poop.  This compact disk is just so horrible i want to warn people out there that they are going to waste their money.
B000069HKH|4.0|While not necessarily on of the Boss's best album, The Rising is filled with more hope and happiness than most of his recent work. Heavily influenced by the events of 9-11, this album deals with issues that range from facing and surviving adversity to the joy of being alive and in love<br />Not as consistent as, say, Born in the U.S.A. or Tunnel of love, this album does have some stand out tracks, namely Lonesome day, My city of ruins, Waitin' on a sunny day and the title track. The music throughout the album is very much Springsteen, as this is the first record he made with the glorious E Street Band in more than a decade. There're a couple of songs that, at least to this listener, sound a bit different from his usual style: World's apart, with some Middle Eastern / World Music influences thrown in there namely the backing vocals (including wife Patti Scialfa) and parts of the melody, and Let's be friends (skin to skin), a pseudo romantic, happy song, this track sounds more like John Mellencamp than Springsteen, which is strange in the sense that even though they both tend to have small town-working man oriented lyrics, their music is almost never similar. This song could easily fit into Mellencamp's Lonesome Jubilee. Also of notice is the absence of American skin (41 shots), a contemporary fan favorite track that hasn't been released on any of his studio albums, but that can be found on the Live in New York City double CD<br />This is a very good, if inconsistent, album that is very easy to listen to, but I wouldn't rank it amongst Springsteen's best work, even if it helped him win a few Grammys. Jon Bon Jovi (a declared Springsteen fan and fellow New Jersey native) once said that this CD was having a &quot;hard time&quot; making its way into (Bon Jovi's) car stereo...but then again, that's just Bon Jovi's opinion.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|Awesome CD!  So refreashing, but yet in a familiar way. Somethings unique here that will appeal to most anyone.<br />Gotta get it!
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album is mos def banging!!!! I think I've scratched it, it hasn't left my CD player yet... Kanye talks about everything the other rappers won't... From giving chickenheads advice on how to catch ballers to begging God for forgiveness to talking about how he landed his deal at Roc-A-Fella, Kanye presents his rhymes in a catchy thought provoking way that can at best be described as being conscious. If Talib Kweli and Common are in your CD rack, COP THIS DISC!!! He makes so much sense it's ridiculous. He's not hip hop's poster boy, but he's undeniably on his way to collectina few awards.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I've been listen to Kanye's beats for years. It is great that he finally decided to come out with an album of his own. This is one of the best put together albums that has come out in some time. Every track on it is amazing. I highly suggest track 18 with mos def, and freeway it is a work of pure genius. Anyway, it doesn't matter what type of music you like, if your into rap or not. Get this album if you only get one this year. I swear you will not be dissapointed.
0385507755|5.0|Some of the others didn't like this book. That's definitely your opinion! I couldn't put the book down! I'm a casual reader that usually reads 5-6 books per year. I read this twice in a two week period. I was so in to this book it's about all I thought about. The writing was very unique, very captivating, and incredibly interesting! If it was made in to a movie I would be first in line!
0440237688|5.0|The Giver, by Lois Lowry, has a great plot and supporting characters.  Jonas, a boy of 12, lives in a family unit in his community.  He serves as the main character who will question all of the rules he has known in his life.  This novel is like a combination of Brave New World and Wait till Helen Comes.  The themes of normal everyday life as we know it are broken by Lowry's great imagination.  If you enjoy a slight bit of fanasty and a relief from the norms, Lowry offers the Giver as a great reward.  This is one of the best novels I have ever read.
B00005JK8K|1.0|Disappointing to say the least. This WAS NOT a factual film....this was an insult to the Brave Men who gave their lives and saved thousands. The Navjo Windtalkers were the deciding factor in the Pacific Theater and their Nation should be given a formal apology by this entire nation as well as Nicolas Cage and  John Woo. Both have lost a devout fan...how sad! Windtalkers is a disgrace!
B00004WG2X|2.0|I just saw the 1980s bbc version after having seen the 1995 version and rereading the book, and it is almost not fair to compare the two movies. The screen writing and direction for the 1995 version is just so much more sophisticated. A very typical example: at the party at Sir Lucas' house toward the beginning of the novel, we have the scene where Elizabeth observes that Darcy is listening to her conversation and she teases him for it. In the 1980s version, Darcy is standing all the way across a rather large and crowded room from her,and she has to wind her way over to him and say something like, &quot;did I not just express myself uncommonly well just now,&quot; or something like that. It made no sense at all. I also agree with a previous reviewer who noted that Kitty looked to be about 40 in the 1980s version. I could go on and on...
B0000VAFO0|5.0|&quot;Underworld&quot; focuses on a war that has been going on for centuries between vampires and werewolves. For the most part, werewolves have become extinct. They have been hunted over the centuries by vampire soliders called Deathdealers. The werewolves however, have discovered a way to turn the war in their favor, by finding a human named Michale Corbin ( Scott Speadman). Michael has the genes necessary to survive a bite from both a werewolf and a vampire, which would help to create a species that would be deadly to the vampires. Things get even worse, when the lead Deathdealer Selene ( Kate Bekinsale) begins to fall in love with Michael. Now it is up to Selene to keep Michael safe from the werewolves so that both Michael and her species can survive.<br />There has been a lot of mixed reviews when it comes to this film, and the general consensus is that &quot;Underworld&quot; had promise but did not live up to the hype. However, I think &quot;Underworld&quot; lived up to the hype and then some. The best thing about this film, is that it offers the one horror battle that we have always wanted to see - vampires vs werewolves. The film pulls it off rather effectively, by demonstrating the hatred the two societies feel for each other. The reason the film pulls you in, is because both sides have valid reasons to be angry. You have a hard time choosing who to root for. The action and special effects in this film are first rate. There are plenty of Matrix like shoot-outs, and state of the art special effects to make the werewolves look rather terrifying. Scott Speadman and Kate Beckinsale are especially good as well, and bring the classic Romeo and Juliet element to the film. They have very good chemistry together.<br />Watching the two groups of classic movie monsters fight it out, really makes Underworld a terrifying thrill ride that will leave you begging for more after the film has ended. Every element of this film was great, from the outstanding plot and specialeffects, to the awesome action sequences and the forbidden love between a vampire and a werewolf. If you are a fan of either action films or horror films, you are sure to enjoy &quot;Underworld&quot;.<br />A solid 5 stars...
B00008OLYN|5.0|I found this band downloading some stuff off of the net, and fell in love...I started with the very first track on this album\\"Windowpane\\", and ever since I haven't stopped listening to them...I bought both \\"Damnation\\" and \\"Blackwater Park\\" and now plan on buying as many of their albums as I can find...I have not found a band as diverse as Opeth anywhere...the beauty is uncomparable...I especially like track 3, \\" Death Wispered a Lullaby\\"... There is a strong sense of jazz in this album, and being a jazz drummer, that means a lot to me...I know a lot of people probably don't like this album, because it's not as heavy as a lot of their stuff, but I think it is one of their best albums yet...
B0001AP12G|5.0|Finally there is a real and truthful cd in the rap world. No Doubt one of the best cd's in years. Much Luv Kanye.

0385510438|1.0|When John Grisham's first book was published I read it and thought it mildly good.  When the second book was published I read that one also and that one was not very good.  I was not surprised when I read he had actually submitted it for publishing some years prior to the first one that WAS published. I concluded his writing was trite and perfect for fleshing out in movies.  Even though I read two books a week on average I have successfully avoided reading any more of his until the other day when a friend gave me The Last Juror and not having anything else to read I read it.  This book is trite, predictable, cliche-ridden and thoroughly boring. The main character writing in the first person is selfish, posturing and patronizing.  His descriptions of his weekly food gorging are disgusting.  I suspect this book was actually written chapter by chapter over a period of years when Mr Grisham was a student in a Mississippi high school and polished off for publication counting on todays' literary appetites i.e. The New York Times Best Seller Lists.  However, I am surprised this latest one even met that smell test.
B000063CMK|5.0|This is an album like most progressive works, that you need to take more than one listen to get into.  It took me two listens and a stroll through the lyric book.  Daniel Gildenlow has to be one of the most talented lyricists in music today.  It irratates me that people want to compare this band to Dream Theater and Symphony X.  Dream Theater, is my favorite band ever, but Pain of Salvation is absolutely nothing like Dream Theater.  If I had to compare POS to anyone, I'd say Tool, as far as great vocals, great lyrics, and heavyness.  Though POS is much more progressive and virtuistic.  POS is truely the thinking man's progressive metal band.  No songs about dragons or greek mythology here.  If you enjoy great emotional lyrics, heavy-diverse music, soaring vocals and creativity, give this band a shot.  This album is as good as any of their others as an introduction to the band.
B00006IU73|4.0|Porcupine Tree is truly the band to bring the progressive rock genre into the new millennium. Although they have created some noteworthy efforts in past years, it is not until \\"In Absentia\\" where the band has really created something very special and worthy of attention. Each song on this album feels like complete chapter in the bigger story of the album. Musically it is thoughtful and full of creativity and surprises. Although lyrically it does leave a bit to be desired in some cases (rather simplistic you could say), which is perhaps the only thing that can be criticized about this work. <br />Nontheless, with this album I feel Porcupine Tree has earned the right to be considered the Pink Floyd for my generation of listeners. A very fine work to own.
B00008MZ0O|4.0|Although the movie is not one of the newest it is still my favorite one, because it is full of action and there are a lot of really cool and fast cars. Perhaps some scenes are a little bit exaggerated, but that is, why I like this actionful movie. Furthermore it is very interesting to get some information about, in which way it is possible to tune a car.<BR>So, I really recommend this movie, especially for people, who like a lot of action and fast cars, too.<BR>Enjoy watching the film...
B000002J09|5.0|Zepelin 4 is a great pice of art. It shows to the world the real 70s rock and roll. This album contains great zepelling songs featuring Stairway to heaven one of the best pice of music of last century. Is an album that all zepelin fans need to have in their bedroom or houses and for new listeners of zepelin this album will show them what have been measing all these time they have not knew of led zepelin.
B000067CPX|5.0|&quot;By the Way&quot; has little in common with the sound or lyrical content of earlier Chili Peppers albums. No &quot;Suck My Kiss&quot; here, no tube socks, no adolescent angst. Lyrically, if these songs weren't inspired by Zen philosophy, then I'm misunderstanding them. And for once a Chili Peppers album has been &quot;evenly&quot; produced - they've got one of the world's most talented bass players, but they don't PROOVE it in every piece. You rarely see a band develop this profoundly and to such great effect (though Beck comes to mind). This album is a masterpiece.
B000002J03|5.0|Really this is the best zepelin album. Since the first time i heard it a really like it. All classic rock fans will love these album because is the best of the best. Is an escential album to had because is a clasicc like the Dark side of the moon and Sgte Pepper Album. Every body who buy these cd will become a zepelin fan!!!!
B00005YW4H|4.0|An amazing, close-up recording highlighting not only Jones's smoky voice, but even the rattle of the strings on her accompanists' guitars. Working with some demo tracks Jones had already recorded, veteran producer Arif Mardin (known for the Dusty Springfield classic Dusty in Memphis, among other albums) brings you closer to the performances than you might have imagined possible. Listen to how Jones sings the words &quot;fresh ice cubes&quot; in the song &quot;Turn Me On&quot;--I bet you've never heard them sung quite that way before, just for you.
B000002GB6|5.0|There 's only one word that can describe this production and that is BRILLIANT, I am not a musician and I am only 30 years old, but the way how the notes flows in this melodies are absolutely marvelous. I strongly recommend to listing to this album with a nice glass of wine, a good company and your eyes close and let the melodies take you to that other level. Personally I will give this production 10 stars. ENJOY IT!!!!
B000001ZS4|5.0|This album edges out its 1976 predecessor, Oxygene, with more memorable melodies and neater use of burbling, bleepy stereo effects. Jarre took full advantage of the lack of good electronic percussion in the mid-'70s, by building rhythms and soundscapes out of other synthetic sounds, molded into two seamless sides of an LP record. You've heard most of it before, even if you've never heard of Jarre. Best listened to in total darkness.
B00005ASOC|5.0|this movie was great. Everything everyone has said is true about it, itis a very uplifting movie and a hope amoungst the hopeless type story. ETC, and for that guy at the bottom who is putting down this movie, he is clueless, Rob Brown has done plenty of acting since Finding Forrester, such as Coach Carter, Orphan King, and Primal. Gotta get ur facts straight before you decide to diss a great movie. Everyone should get this DVD. Thanks for reading
B000089RV6|5.0|In February 2003, the American distribution rights to AC/DC's back catalog transferred over to Epic, their new label. Epic then reissued the band's catalog as remastered digipacks containing lavish, expanded booklets with plenty of rare photographs, memorabilia and notes.<br />Although the digipacks may wear a little too easy, the sound is terrific, clean and muscular, enhancing the raw qualities of the original record. And \\"Back In Black\\" certainly deserves this kind of loving treatment; it is AC/DC's best and most popular album by far, having sold well over forty million copies worldwide, which makes it one of the ten best-selling albums ever, regardless of genre.<BR>(AC/DC remains the single best-selling hard rock or heavy metal band in the world, nearing the 150.000.000 mark, and outselling bands like The Rolling Stones, Aerosmith, and even the mighty Led Zeppelin.)<br />\\"Back In Black\\" is one of rock's all-time classic records. Not a single weak track is included, even the lesser-known album tracks are strong, and it is filled with powerful riffs, huge hooks and tough, bluesy grooves.<BR>The lyrics are a joke, of course, all booze and sex and rock n' roll, and Brian Johnson screams rather than sings, but AC/DC at the top of their game wrote the best, catchiest hard rock songs you can imagine, like the grand, anthemic \\"Hell's Bells\\" or the magnificent title track.<br />And AC/DC doesn't just thrash away or plod along like your average heavy metal band; they literally swing on \\"Have A Drink On Me\\", and rhythm guitarist Malcolm Young churns out one sturdy riff after another. Just listen to the incredible groove he lays down on songs like \\"Given The Dog A Bone\\", \\"Back In Black\\", \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", and the slow, bluesy (and superbly sleazy) \\"Let Me Put My Love Into You\\".<br />Hard rock doesn't get any better than this. In fact, it barely ever gets this good.
B00011RPB0|1.0|I rented the DVD after all the hype from the Golden Globes and Oscars.  It was sheer boredom.  The cinematography reminded me of the Blair Witch Project - TERRIBLE.  After the first 10 minutes, we understood the cultural isolation - after 45 minutes of belaboring the point, we wondered why we were still watching.  I was never so glad that I didn't pay the box office ticket price to view this film or purchase it.  I really wonder what the critics were thinking.  I can only guess they like the Coppola name.
0312995423|1.0|I love Dan Brown's other books and I couldn't believe how bad this one was.  Clearly the publisher is capitalizing on readers like me who have high expectations based on Da Vinci Code, Angels and Demons and Deception Point.  The dialogue was bad, the characters were unlikeable and the plot progression was ridiculous.  I kept reading thinking this book couldn't possibly end without a good twist or some redeeming feature. But it did.
B000002KHH|5.0|tonyhawk is absolutely right. hand of doom is the best song on paranoid. it's my all-time fave black sabbath tune. the way the song changes during the middle and the cool bass hooks at the beginning + towards the end. everyone likes war pigs, fairies wear boots, iron man. blah blah. all that radio friendly stuff! ;). although, those tunes do rule. here's my top 5 sabbbath songs(in order) hand of doom, into the void, behind the wall of sleep, iron man &amp; supernaut.
B0000E2FLC|5.0|AC/DC's live at Donnington was one hell of a concert. man oh man do I wish I was there for that show. The band is top notch and in perfect form. All the songs are performed flawlessly. I swear AC/DC is the second greatest live band of all time. (second only to Aerosmith of course). This is truly an awesome show. The song selection is awsome, with the best of Bon Scotts era and Brian Johnsons era up untill 1990 of course. When you watch this make sure you watch the whole scene for 'Jailbreak' because if you didnt know before you will know afterwards why Angus Young is without a shadow of a doubt one of the very best guitar players that ever lived! Highly recomended!
0385504209|1.0|The arrogant hero uses every breathless adverb in his arsenal and invents a few to tell us all he knows about the Louvre on his way to a murder. He is stunned and amazed so many times in the first 40 pages, I kept wondering why author was trying so hard to boost the  juice in the narrative. Would you just get to the murder and stop telling us that three Eiffel Towers laid on their side equals . . . (Sorry, that's a cliffhanger.)<br />But I admit I was already turned off by this story in the first two pages. Because the albino villain (and fear not, Brown will stop his story, just as I am stopping mine to explain the origin of the word, villain) went to the murder scene intending to commit murder with only one bullet in the clip of his pistol. That was so he could shoot his victim only once in the stomach and not use the second shot to the head to finish him. Because if he finished him, the guy wouldn't have time to leave behind all his clues for the arrogant hero to find. Please. Not another Dan Brown story in which every major plot point turns on the stupidity of a major character. (Digital Fortress was another one. In that story a brilliant guy lets himself get deked by another brilliant guy who . . .) Sorry, that's another cliffhanger. Get used to it in this guy's books.<br />So then, although he has a second clip on him, the villain still does not finish the job. He just walks away like one of those villains in the campy Batman TV shows. Please, please.<br />By page fifty, I was wishing the villain wasn't so stupid. That he had used a second bullet to put this book out of its misery right from the start. I haven't walked out of a novel in a long time. I'm just glad I borrowed this turkey from the library. It's going back unread.
B0001AP12G|4.0|Kayne West has the most abrupt rhymeing scheme i've heard in a while. on this cd, he talks about some rather contravercial topics, but the politics does not out weigh the true depth and perseption of this rapper. i see this man being at the heights of Jay-Z if he plays his cards right. Big things in mr. West's future...lets just hope he doesn't mess up on his next album and let critics forget about this nugget of hip-hop gold...
B00006AFUR|5.0|Oh my God!  This has to be one of the greatest albums ever recorded.  30 Seconds To Mars are a band that nobody can even come close to comparing to.  In my opinion, they're the most original band out there today.  Their s/t debut album is full of so much potential.  If the record label pushed them right, I think this could be a number one album.  A friend of mine heard TSTM's song &quot;Capricorn&quot; about a year or so before it was ever released.  This was back in the days of AuidoGalaxy.  But the only version we could ever find for any of their songs was like the poorest quality you could ever hear.  And the songs were still amazing.  Needless to say, I think I was the first one to by this album in the Houston area.  Words can't even begin to describe how amazing this album is, you just need to here it for yourself.  And Jared Leto has an awesome voice.  Everyone and their mom should give these guys a listen.  My favorite songs include:  Capricorn (A Brand New Name), Oblivion, Echelon, End of the Beginning, and 93 Million Miles.<br />01 - Capricorn (A Brand New Name) - 5/5 <BR>02 - Edge of the Earth - 4/5<BR>03 - Fallen - 4/5<BR>04 - Oblivion - 5/5<BR>05 - Buddha For Mary - 4/5<BR>06 - Echelon - 5/5<BR>07 - Welcome To the Universe - 4/5<BR>08 - Mission - 4/5<BR>09 - End of the Beginning - 5/5<BR>10 - 93 Million Miles - 5/5<BR>11 - Year Zero - 4/5
B0000AQS0F|5.0|QUICK, Everyone write to FOX!  They brought Star Trek the original series back in the late 60's didn't they?!  This show ROCKS!  Far better than many of the other so-called \\"quality\\" sci-fi shows which have been on the air for several seasons.  The images, lighting, sets, and special effects are some of the best I have seen (the DVD quality of this set is extremely high!!!), and overall the show was highly realistic compared to most other science fiction/outer space shows I have seen from ANY era.  This was a quality program! The writing was top notch.  Also, many scenes are truly humorous without obviously trying to be funny. If FOX won't listen, perhaps one of the other networks would... The person at FOX who axed this program should definitely lose his/her golden parachute and or stock options!
B00005JM1F|4.0|I thought this was one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time. The plot is pretty basic, as it's about a start-up frat that the dean of the college and old college rival of the frat founders (Will ferrel, Luke Wilson, and Vince Vaughn) wants to have them removed from his campus. Through parties, and subversive behavior the frat finds it's way to stay on campus and more importantly make us the audience laugh. The frat brothers are as diverse as it gets, from an enormously overweight kid to an incredibly old sailor named Blue. I wasn't really a huge Will Ferrel fan going into this film, but after seeing this hilarious film with some seriouss spray milk through the nose moments I came out ranking his performance up their with the likes of Bill Murray, Chevy Chase, John Belushi, and Dan Akroyd. His scene in the pool will go down in history as one of the all time great comedy classics. The only weak parts in this film to me were some of the romantic sub-plots between Luke Wilson and his old high school sweet heart. The moments between the two are too warm and touching for this film. These continually reoccuring scenes felt out of place in this outrageous laugh fest of a film. But this complaint is minor. If you are up for a hilarious time, and want to laugh like crazy pick up this amazing film.
B0000DD7LC|5.0|I sincerely enjoyed this CD, which i got kinda late but it was seriously worth the ?? i spent on it! my favorite songs are definatly: karma, heartburn, if i was ur woman, u don noe mai name, diary, so simple, dragon days and thas all i can remember now....BUY IT!
B0000640VO|5.0|Amelie as the name suggests is about a girl, named Amelie, big surprise there, eh? The story follows Amelie from conception to her twenty something's, filled with wild quirks and flashy fixating visuals that fix you to your seat, so much so that a passer by might think you a comatose patient, with drool and all. The drool appears as a result of the childish, lively presence of its main attraction Audrey Tautuo, who fills the main role with such charm and playfulness that it could only be described as astounding. The world this movie brings you to might not be the most realistic you've seen of this kind but it is definitely a wacky adventure of all the little things that are generally only lightly touched upon in a movie but never made it's main clause. If you're the type of person that would growl at movie's that make you go \\"aaah\\" then this movie is not for you, if you are not, then this is a movie that will delight you from start to finish. Amelie is one of those experiences that can only be experienced once, so watch it while you can.
B0001611DI|5.0|Zombie movies.  Lots of \\"serious\\" types look down on them.  That's a shame, because some of them are really first-rate films.  Dawn of the Dead, the middle film of George Romero's \\"dead\\" trilogy, is a case in point.  You want zombies, we got your zombies RIGHT HERE!  You want blood?  Guts?  Flesh eating?  Oh boy, does Dawn of the Dead ever deliver!<br />And then it does something really unique - it also delivers drama, engaging characters with realistic delimmas, a smartly crafted story, and a heavy dose of dead-on social satire.  And did I mention that it's just flat-out scary as hell, too?<br />There is one scene in particular, toward the beginning, that still haunts me - twenty some-odd years after I first saw it.  The National Guard has been called in to clear a tenament building.  In the basement, they find a cage where the dead have been locked away.  The simple, unsettling music of Goblin rises on the soundtrack, underscored by a heartbeat-like bass drum.  There are the zombies, many in death shrouds, feasting on body parts.  Guardsman Peter Washington (Ken Foree) steps into the nightmare with a pistol to dispatch the zombies with bullets to their heads.  The whole thing takes on a surreal, hellish texture, like a Bosch painting.  Foree's performance is striking - he is truly IN THE MOMENT, as they say, without a hint of the winking self-awareness we see in other genre flicks.  If the dead really started coming back to feed on the living, this is exactly what it be like.  This is the toll it would exact on people trying to grapple with the situation.<br />Yet, in a way, Dawn of the Dead IS self-aware.  It knows when to step back, too, and admit that it's playing with you.  Another scene, of this sort, occurs when we see a group of rednecks hunting the shambling corpses as though they were deer.  They sip coffee from thermoses, pass sandwiches around, and banter about their accuracy with their rifles.  It's a very funny bit, in part because it's so deadpan.<br />Those are just two favorite examples.  There is much, much more to this film, and almost all of it works beautifully.  Even the sometimes obviously low budget and gleeful use of library stock music doesn't hurt.  Romero turns these limitations to his advantage, by making them serve as searing comments on mass media, consumerism, and pop culture.<br />Performances by David Emge, Scott Reiniger, and Gaylen Ross are worthy of mention, too.  They play real people in an extraordinary situation, rather than two-dimensional horror-movie characters.<br />Dawn of the Dead schlock as high art - complex, funny, scary, and engaging.  And thank goodness it's coming back to DVD, because it's one worth watching over and over again.br />Those are just two favorite examples.

B000000OQF|5.0|Make no mistake about it, this album, one of the greatest ever, is meant to be heard loud.  The louder you crank it, the better it seems to be.  Slash's brilliant guitar work screams with a full range of emotion, and Axl's shrill voice has so much force behind it that it can send shivers up your spine.  The pure energy of this album can make you feel as though you are right with the band, drugged up and partying with racy women in 1980's LA.  Paradise City, Sweet Child Of Mine, and Welcome to the Jungle are the headline hits, but from top to bottom, this album is full of dynamic hits.  With lyrics derived from the band's full embrace of the fringe benefits of rock-star fame, and the illicit pleasure a city such as LA has to offer, many listeners such as myself cannot identify directly, but are conveyed so realistically that they can be universally felt.  5 Stars, Hands Down, Beer Bottles and Volume Up.
B00018D44U|2.0|I don't know, but Norah Jone's just doesn't do it for me on this album.  Every single track is very slow and very relaxing.  Don't get me wrong - I LOVE slow and relaxing music.  That's more my style, so of course, I LOVE Norah Jones and her soft voice.  But for some reason, the songs weren't up to par on this album.  Her voice is just as great as Come Away With Me, but the songs are so slow and boring!  I couldn't even listen to the entire cd.  The only good songs are Sunshine and Creepin' In with Dolly Pardon.  I suggest that if you want soft, easy listening - buy Mindy Smith, she does it much better than Norah this time.
0385504209|5.0|The great thing about this awsome book is that it is ALL TRUE!  It's great being able to get educated and entertained at the same time.  I now know that Catholics are evil and the one true religion is paganism!  These are just two of the eye opening facts revealed in this great work of literature.
B000001IQH|5.0|I find it amuzing that any self respecting punk fan could not give the complete five for this album.  Anybody who has even heard of punk either owns or has stolen this disc from a friend.  Forget the politics, this album has always stood alone.
B000002U82|4.0|... they are genius. This should be owned by everyone who has a broken (or who has broken) a heart. Who makes music like this now?
0553213105|4.0|Austen is a wonderful omniscient author and has a delightful perspective on people's traits and character. She realized that people are complex, and included their different sides in these characters. It's a feel good book, and we need those once in a while. Its like a mature fairy tale. This is my favorite book, however I only give it four stars because it didn't pose a challenge or have me ready to change the world, however I enjoyed this enduring love story.
B000006TRV|4.0|... about cocaine? The loneliness, the hopelessness, the end? This is a life changing piece of art that I'm not even sure the band knows they created. The world is a cold, empty place. Thanks to PF for pointing it out.
B00004TJFL|4.0|Hallloween 5 was ok I mean it wasn't as scary and suspensful as the others were.Seriously what's with the guy in the cult that's controling Michael that's not scary I mean sure it gets you confused but weres the fun in that.
0061015725|5.0|Not only is this book a brilliant addition to an already impressive body of work by this great American science fiction and high-tech writer, including &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;, &quot;Congo&quot;, and more, but, as with all his books, he creates completely believable characters populating completely believable worlds which, naturally, make the high-tech part of the stories completely believable...from cloned dinosaurs to nano-bots...this great author is up there with others of both older science fiction, of which I am well acquainted as I push 50, like &quot;Stranger in a Strange Land&quot;, &quot;Rendezvous with Rama&quot;, as well as what some call cyberpunk like &quot;Neuromancer&quot;, &quot;Mona Lisa Overdrive&quot;, &quot;Snow Crash&quot;, &quot;Darkeye: Cyber Hunter&quot;, etc. So get this latest book from Michael Crichton and add it to your own collection.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I first saw Norah Jones on Saturday Night Live.  She performed the now, smash-hit \\"Don't Know Why\\".  After hearing her perform, I went out the next day and immediately bought the CD.  For only hearing one song, I must say that the CD WASN'T what I expected at ALL!  It was MUCH, MUCH better and a truly pleasant surprise.  I really don't know how to categorize Miss Jones as she is jazz, country, pop, blues, & R&B all wrapped up in a beautiful package.  I liked all the songs on the disc, especially since they are old, new, and each one a little gem and totally different. My faves are \\"Don't Know Why\\" ( I think I probably played it 40 times in a row), \\"Come Away With Me\\", the old standard \\"The Nearness Of You\\" and other oldies, \\"Turn Me On\\" & \\"I've Got To See You Again\\" .  Norah is very eclectic and has that ol' music gene in her blood.  Her father is pan flute artist, Ravi Shankur. I highly recommend this CD.  It's my favorite of 2003!
B000002V1D|3.0|Please Amazon - note that your track listing is for a completely different album from your review. 'Girls on Film' was on the 1981 debut 'Duran Duran' (along with their debut single 'Planet Earth' and 'Careless Memories'). 'Ordinary World' came out 1993 on what I presume you're referring to as the 'Wedding Album'.
0441003257|5.0|I recommend this book for anyone who wondered why the heck the world has to end anyways. Also, for those who enjoy a bit of off the wall humor, this is the perfect Armageddon to be at. I loved it! Gaiman has become a favorite of mine, and this book helped with that decision. I read it in a few hours, couldn't put it down. Really makes you think and makes you laugh all at the same time.
B00005MP58|5.0|This movie is one of the best ! If you like movies like Mansfield Park, Daniel Deronda, Tess of the D'Urbervilles, Wuthering Heights, Wives and Daughters and Emma this movie is for you.<br />The actors are brilliant, especially Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. You will not be disappointed...
B0000A1RJI|5.0|If you loved the movie you will love this soundtrack.  It is definately worth buying.  It is a very upbeat soundtrack, great for listening while working on the computer.  This ranks right up there with Lord of the Rings (all 3) as one of my favorites.
B0001AP12G|5.0|this album has shocked the heck out of me. I was ready for another producer turned rapper type of cd. I expected it not have lyrical content and only rap about bling bling and how many cars he has. This album shows that kanye may be a college drop out but he definitely learned something. Brotha man used his production skills effectively and the collabo with jay z proves he is here to stay. This album is definitely worth every cent. I applaud kanye for a job well done on his debut cd.
B0000028RR|5.0|This is the greatest rap/metal/hardrock blend of music you will pick up. If you have never heard of this album, you must if you want some really good music to rock to. This is their best album in my opinion and too bad they broke up. Audioslave's a great band though, with former band members of RATM, and Soundgarden's Chris Cornell.
B0000509C4|2.0|I'm a fan of the original CREEPSHOW; it was fun, scary, good music, and was smartly directed by horror master George Romero. This uninexusable sequel doesn't even cut the first act; there is hardly any enjoyment, flatly directed and acted, the music sounds like something from a 70's porn movie, and there is only three stories! The first CREEPSHOW had five stories!<br />CREEPSHOW 2 is not terrible, or even bad, it's just uninspired. The (only) three tales helped proved this theory. The narrator is The Creeper, who looks more like a comedian then a scary host in the first one.<br />Anyway, the first tale is OL' CHIEF WOODENHEAD. A revenge tale with a wooden Indian coming to life to kill the thugs who murdered his beloved owners. It has its moments, but none that stand out. Not really scary, but I was glad the wooden Indian got payback. It's not even the best story.<br />The second tale is better, but still has some flaws. THE RAFT has four teenagers visiting a secluded lake for some fun. But the fun turns into a nightmare when one by one all fall victim to a large, oily-like substance in the lake. It sounds like a very scary campfire story to tell, but director Michael Gornick does a poor job at following George Romero's footsteps by building a pretty good written story to life. He doesn't even have the actors motivated in this tale, because they're acting is terrible. It does has some scary moments. It could be the best tale, if the film was good.<br />The last story is pretty suddled at best. THE HITCHHIKER, who many consider to be the best tale, should't even belong in a CREEPSHOW film because it's too simple. Simple is a understatement, as a cheating wife accidently runs over a hitchhiker. Her self-concerned state foolishly has her leaving the scene. Her mistake has her being stalked by the ghoulish man, but she can't help by shaking him off! The only highlight is the line by the dead hitchhiker: \\"Thanks for the ride lady!\\" But everything else is dull. Oh yeah, watch for Stephen King as a truck driver in this one!<br />I was pretty dissapointed by CREEPSHOW 2. All the hair-raising fun from the original is non-existent here. Even though Romero wrote the unstirring screenplay, he was badly needed as director to bring a real comic-book atmosphere like he did for the original. There's hardly any here except for a animated segment involving a boy and his gigantic venus flytrap. Pretty standard stuff, as was the film. <br />I reccomend the first CREEPSHOW ten times more then this one. Although, it's essential to view if you like the first movie. Just beware!
B000062YAZ|5.0|This album is a prime example of how metal should be played. Fast, aggressive, angry, and brutal. If you like real metal you will love this album. Every song on here is excellent, including the 2 bonus tracks at the end. Besides the legendary Angel of Death and Raining Blood, I would say my favorite songs from this album are Altar of Sacrifice, Epidemic, and Postmortem. I see some people have been giving this album a very low score but they don't know what metal is.
B00005JH7D|4.0|If only Marcus Miller could let the engineers mix his, admittedly gorgeous, bass lines a little lower the thing would gel into one of the most perfect jazz-funk albums on the market. <BR>also it really picks up towards the middle from Nikki's Groove onwards it rocks. And Herbie Hancock's piano on Gooodbye Pork Pie hat is sublime. <BR>Well worth hearing but not five-star.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I just bought this album today, but I've been listening to it non-stop ever since...It's got a great feel to it, very refreshing. His voice doesn't really stand out but that's what makes his music raw and natural. Lisa Hannigan, who accompanies him in the vocals, is also great. All in all, this album is great for when you're in a chill-out mood, the lyrics are much deeper than your everyday songs, and the instruments in the background accompany Damien's voice perfectly.<br />Edit: 'Scuse me, I've changed my mind- his voice does stand out!
B000002HPV|5.0|Homogenic is a state of the art album.  Great tunes, and great artwork.  Bjorks vocals take you to another world...electric, syphonic, and relaxing...'All Is Full Of Love' is the gem on this must have Bjork CD.
B00005Y228|5.0|This is a great pop dance comeback album for Kylie.  After being overseas for so many years, Kylie is finally making a comeback in the states.  From the first song \\"More More More\\" to the last song, this album is very upbeat and so Kylie Minogue.  I also recomend her album \\"Light Years\\" which is easy to get in the states.  Her new album \\"Slow\\" does not live up to this album.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|The 1st X-Men was like the extended trailer as one of the actors put it, and I agree...but X2 blew me away!  The plot is thicker, and the charactors more well developed.  I'm truly looking forward to a 3rd X-Men movie!
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin DeGraw, a veritable newcomer, proves that with this CD, he can play with the big boys. His songs, lyrics and music written by himself are perfect. They completely compliment his voice and range. He reminds me of Roy Orbison in this regard, the way he could write music to match his voice perfectly. Buy this album and fall into GD's spell.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|Just like in 'Blade', 'Blade II' blows me away as one of the best vampire movies!  The 2nd one makes you think a bit more than the 1st - and that's a good thing.
0060516402|5.0|Built to Last by James C. Collins and Jerry I. Porras is an essential guide for any new or old organization looking to get started or revitalize its fundamental foundation and business practices.  Assembled as a result of a six year long study examining eighteen remarkable and long-lasting companies in relation to each companies top \\"market\\" competitor, this book genuinely shows what distinguishes truly visionary companies from the rest.  This books begins by briefly describing what visionary companies were chosen for the study and why.  For those interested, visionary companies included organizations such as Wal-Mart, American Express, IBM, and Walt Disney, just to name a few.<br />According to Collins and Porras, a visionary company can neither be founded on a single great idea nor rely on an individual charismatic leader.  Those in a visionary company must be willing and able to put the organization first in order not only to make an impact after the death of any individual leader but also to stand the test of time.  Essential in any visionary company is a statement of what the company stands for and why it exists - its core ideology consisting of its core values and core purpose.  For example, a company must exist for a number of reasons beyond just making money.  Along with this statement of core ideology must come a plan for action, a plan to stimulate and drive progress in an organization toward an envisioned future.  A key concept from this book is preserving the core of an organization while stimulating progress within that organization.  Change in an organization is a constant with respect to everything but the organization's core ideology.<br />A visionary organization can stimulate progress in a number of ways from setting BHAGs or Big Hairy Audacious goals, to creating and promoting a cult-like culture within the organization, to trying a lot of stuff and keeping what works, and finally, to relying on homegrown management.  In a visionary company, goodenough never is, there is never an end to the movement for continual progress, and every member in the organization is a key player encouraged to take personal initiative.  A visionary company is a great place to work if and only if you strongly agree and adhere to its values and purpose.  <br />This book was not only insightful, but it provided the steps necessary for any organization to take strides toward becoming a visionary company.  Although information at times was repetitive, it proved useful in hammering home key concepts crucial to understanding what makes a visionary company truly visionary.  The book was an easy read, and the authors were quick to point out that this book is not the \\"ultimate truth\\" when it comes to understanding organizations.  I would recommend this book to anyone.  It is worth a read, and definitely worth the money!
B00005JM02|5.0|This is simply a delightful movie.  Great for kids, or adults who want to get in touch with their 'kid' side again.  Parts of this movie made me laugh so hard it brought me to tears!  A real winner!
0792423313|5.0|Prelude to Foundation by Isaac Asimov, one of the most prolific writers of science fiction, is a prequel to his most acclaimed series, The Foundation Trilogy. The book traces the adventures of Hari Seldon, a young mathematician who thinks he has found a way to predict the future. He calls his theory psychohistory, and is based in part on the Chaos theory and lots and lots of math. The only downside of this is that his theory only works on large populations of people, meaning that it cannot foresee certain events for a particular person.  Hari travels to Trantor, the \\"capital\\" of the Galactic Empire to attend a conference and present his new ideas. His idea however, catches the eyes of Cleon I, the emperor, and becomes the most wanted man in the universe and is soon hiding from the imperial guards.  As he dodges the guards, he traverses the vast terrain of Trantor and further perfects his theory on psychohistory. The book continues on how he finally escapes and lays down the outline for the Foundation, a new empire more advanced and majestic than the previous. <BR> I found this book to be intriguing and interesting. Asimov is great in developing his characters and makes them very believable and all have a great depth in their behaviors and thoughts. That is one reason why I liked this book. Another reason is because this book is paced much faster than the other Asimov books I've read, making it more suspenseful and an easier read. His older books were very technical and included lots of scientific words while this book has less of that and more excitement. Since Asimov wrote this book about 30 years after he wrote the Foundation Trilogy, he has had more time to think about the story and make it more believable. Also since he connected most of his works, this book also acts as a bridge between some of his works. I suggest this book to anyone who likes science fiction or just someone who wants a good book to read.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I have heard alot of people say that this album is refreshing, groundbreaking, and even a return to what hip hop once was.  On some levels I can agree to some of that.  On another level I can't forget about the cats who have been putting it down like that for their whole careers.  Cats like Black Star, Gang Starr, Tribe, Common, Mos Def (solo), Kweli (solo), and The Roots just to name a few.  Besides the Rockafella camp these are just some of the names that Kanye has chosen to partner up with the last 4 or 5 years.  Near the beginning of last year Common played the House of Blues (Chicago) promoting his Electric Circus release.  His opening act was Talib Kweli.  In the middle of Kweli's set he introduced Kanye and let him perform 2 songs.  My point is Kanye has had some of the best &quot;teachers&quot; in the business.  What is &quot;refreshing&quot; is that a cat that is going to sell probaly a million copies in his first month is making people take notice that there always has been a &quot;substance&quot; side to hip hop.  In the process of all of our praise we shouldn't forget The Roots, Common, Little Brother, Kweli, Mos, and others who have been down for the struggle but don't have the record sales that say so.  Maybe this will all change as I hear Kanye is working on the next Common album.  Maybe Kanye will continue to use his powers for good, and bring hip hop back into balance.-18651
B0000DD7LB|1.0|Britney has never created a half decent album, and this is no exception. First, her voice sucks and should be muted always. Second,she is constantly throwing out these stupid tape loops with &quot;music&quot; in them. Last,she gets all these rappers with &quot;talent&quot; to do all the work for her. Avoid this album at all costs, remember, I warned you.
B000000WF0|5.0|This is a great album. I was given this as a birthday present from my sweet girlfriend and I seriouly thought that this was a chickflick kind of band. BUT THEY RULE! Amazing band, Amazing music, Amazing lyrics. Dont listen to the naysayers, please buy this!     Highlight of the album: This Time
B00005JLEX|5.0|What is wrong with the Simpsons and Seinfeld!!! they're taking forever!!! I guess they're pretty smart though... by the time they come out people will be dying for it...<br />i don't think anything really needs to be said about the series...a show about NOTHING doesn't seem too entertaining but you can not watch an episode of seinfeld without laughing.
B00008OLYN|5.0|This could be the best album that came out in 2003. Heavily underrated and not played widely. I saw them live for this album and they simply showed us what it means to be making music.     Highlight of this album: Hope Leaves    ps: I seriously wonder why this album isnt famous as it should be. We have all that MTV rubbish polluting our airwaves.
0140277447|1.0|The interesting thing with Truth Sayer's review is the blamings made here are quite similar to GHQ's propaganda when Japan had been under its despotism.<BR>I think seeing the GHQ propaganada and censoring is a good start for Japaneses and Americans to release ourselves from the fallacy. &quot;Nanking Massacre&quot; had been a part of GHQ's propaganda program.<BR>I recommend Hosaka Masayasu's &quot;Nihon Kaitai&quot; (Breaking up Japan) to know about the GHQ propaganda and Etou Jun's &quot;Tozasareta Gengo Kuukan&quot; (Closed Language Space) for pursuing the censorship. Kai Yuzuru's &quot;GHQ Censor&quot; is a must read for all Japaneses, which is a first hand testimony written by the former censor who had been working in GHQ.
B0000CFW87|1.0|My sincere apology to the great Siberian baritone, Dmitri Hvorostovsky and to all the other wonderful singers mentioned in a previous review. My BIG mistake to compare this league of extraordinary gentlemen to Gorban. It is TOO flattering to Groban. He is way out of the league.<br />As for the music fan from the wonderful Texas, if you cannot tell the difference between Mr. Hvorostovsky' voice and Mr. Terfel's (I did not ask you to listen to Mr. Terfel, although Mr. Terfel is much much better to listen to than Mr. Gorban), you obviously did not listen to them at all. I doubt you have listened to rest of the singers. To you, all opera singers are \\"nasal\\". But you got one thing correct: Gorban is not an opera singer.  To be an opera singer requires much more. Please don't call yourself a classical music fan and you will confuse some dim witted record company executives to push the legitimate opera singers to do \\"crossover\\" cds. By the way, just because most people wear cubic zirconia and drink beer does not mean that diamonds and champagne is not the best. But then it is unfair to compare diamond to cubic zirconia.
B000002H8F|4.0|Since listening to Bossanova was my introduction to the Pixies, it will probably always be my favorite Pixies album. Check out track 2, &quot;Rock Music&quot;. It's great (loud &amp; totally obnoxious)!
0006392970|5.0|Even though Michael Crichton's books often start out slow, that is because he is building characters and a world around them for the reader to believe in before taking us on whatever incredible journey he takes us. Such was how it was with \\"Prey\\" and the problems arising from nanotechnology in relation to humanity. Very suspenseful. It takes its place amongst other Michael Crichton works like \\"Jurassic Park\\", \\"Sphere\\", \\"Airframe\\", \\"Timeline\\", and so on as well as ranking up there with other science fiction/high tech books like \\"Neuromancer\\" \\"Mona Lisa Overdrive\\", \\"Snow Crash\\", \\"Cryptonomicon\\", \\"Altered Carbon\\", \\"Darkeye: Cyber Hunter\\", and so forth. Buy it...you won't be disappointed.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is what hip-hop is missing...ORIGINALITY. K. West brings it to the table for all of us to eat off of it. The production is tight, and guess what the lyrics are tight. he has SUBSTANCE people, have we 4 got that this is one of the most important things of the art form, TO SPIT SUMTHIN THAT MAKES SENSE. don't buy this cd looking to dance, or to learn something, or because \\"u think the beats will be phat\\". buy it for all of the above.<br /><br />Personal classic and with time I feel it will be a hip hop classic.
B000000OTU|5.0|How can you not love a band that comes up with the perfect title for their second greatest hits package?  It could also be called &quot;Back from the morgue&quot; because this collection reflects the second coming of Aerosmith quite well.  There's not a dead spot on the cd.  Every song rolls into the next with ease.  The guitar performances, Tyler's vocals and superb drumming make this band one of the very best ever and hearing these tunes back to back confirms it.  Highly recommended.
B000003TA4|4.0|I wouldent say this is the best of nirvanas work i personally love incesticide and bleach way better the only reason why i like this and i would recommend it is because of all the other songs like drain you,lithium,somthing in the way, because i dont think smells like teen spirit is all that great of a song its ok but if u expect the whole album to sounds like teen spirit then just buy the single! but all in all its great album a little overated but thats ok!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|This is one of the best CDs of 2003. I don't think it ought to be compared with 'Stripped' because they are two different categories if you ask me. <BR>I do wish her voice would get better. It is, however, better than it used to be. I really don't think people should keep critisizing her voice. Because that's the one thing people can't help. I mean there isn't any surgery that improves your voice. She sings pretty well even without very good vocals so I appreciate her efforts.
B000003TAB|5.0|This album is probably the best one i think becausethere all b-sides that were suppose to come out on the bleach album its simply awsome to listen to all the way through every track is awsome from dive to the las track Aneurysm its way better than the over rated nevermind i think this album is just the best one hard riffs good cover songs they do from the vaselines its everything a nirvana fan wants from a album buy it its worth the money!!!
B00003CXC7|5.0|I cannot get enough of this DVD.  When I read the storyline of \\"Rear Window\\", I thought it would be boring.  The main guy never leaves this one room of his house. However, it is pleaseantly surprising.  The other residents of the complex made me laugh, cry, hate them, love them, all emotions at once.  the plot starts slowly and escalates to a very suspenseful climax and ends with a happily ever after type thing.  My eight year old daughter and I rented this.  Now, we own it and watch it over and over again.  This is a must own DVD.
B0001AP158|5.0|Well the boys are back, and they are better than ever! It is no wonder why they have always been my favorite band. It is very rare to find a band that cares so much about their fans, and their music, that they work their butts off to give us something new, and amazing every time. Some people, like the reviewer directly below me, are content with buying, and hearing the same songs over, and over, and over again. More power to them. Just stick to buying albums from bands that give you the same recordings of songs, with new arrangements throughout 5 different Greatest Hits albums. I will stick with Bon Jovi. A band that really cares about their fans.<br />I really wish I could have been at this concert. The songs sound amazing with their new direction. The picture quality is killer. The DVD comes with great extras including interactive poker with the band, and video of six songs performed live in concert in Hyde Park England. Their is also a 30 minute making of the concert, mini documentary. I can not rate this DVD high enough. Any true Bon Jovi fan will love this. Hell, anyone would love this! Rock on Bon Jovi!!!!!!!!!
B00012FXB8|4.0|i have seen both versions of the film and I think the workprint is way better except one thing,  how did the cow get an alien in it.  in the theatrical it explains how the dog got the facehugger but in the work print you just all of a sudden get introduced to a dead cow who has the alien burst out of it.  other than that the work print is way better deffinitly reccomended to any alien fan.
0142004235|4.0|East of Eden is the colorful three-generation saga of an American family (the Trasks) embroiled in their emotional, ever-so-human contest with the moral forces of good and evil.  Set in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the story follows Cyrus Trask, his sons Adam and Charles, and Adam's sons Aron and Caleb, through their eventful, changing, sometimes violent lives, sweeping from a farm in Connecticut to Steinbeck's home in the Salinas Valley of California.  As the novel unfolds, we meet personifications of \\"good\\" in the character of Samuel Hamilton, Adam's kind-hearted neighbor whose nine children help fill out the story, and \\"evil\\" as represented particularly by Kate, Adam's malicious wife who fittingly comes to run a local whorehouse.<br />Steinbeck provides us with what is presumably his own interpretation of the Bible's Cain and Abel story through the guiding, balanced commentary of an unexpectedly erudite Mr. Lee, Adam's American-born Chinese servant.  In the Bible, Cain, angered by God's rejection, kills his brother, Abel, and suffers lifelong guilt from his misplaced revenge.  For Steinbeck, man (we are all Cain's descendants) is neither predestined (thou shalt) nor commanded (do thou) to rise above sin; rather, the individual has freedom of choice (thou mayest).  Importantly, through individual choice, each person is free to direct his own life to attain true glory and the triumph of the human spirit.  Ultimately, when a person dies, he is judged not by his wealth, influence and power, but by the answer to a simple question:  Was he good or evil, loved or hated?<br />In my opinion, the noticeable flaw in this otherwise exceptional work is Steinbeck's deliberate placement of his characters into a Cain and Abel framework, with Charles and Caleb being troubled Cain, and Adam and Aron the fairer Abel.  The book reads as if Steinbeck first decided on the philosophical theme for the work and then applied his adroit literary hand to build interesting, absorbing characters to fit the mold.  I believe that the novel could have become an even grander work of literature if Steinbeck had more naturally allowed his striking talent for rich character development to enjoy a still larger role, while relegating the Cain and Abel theme to a more subtle, purely motivational position.
B00000J6AG|4.0|I assume everyone has this by now, but if not, it's a pretty amazing album. I think &quot;Moby&quot; is pretty much thought of as techno, but there's so much more on here. Some of this is techno, but it's also gospel, pop, new age, blues, ambient, etc. The hits like &quot;Southside&quot; and &quot;Bodyrock&quot; are definitely the most upbeat tracks, others are beautiful and hypnotic, and could put you to sleep. &quot;Porcelain&quot; and &quot;Natural Blues&quot; were also singles off this, and I like the songs &quot;Why Does My Heart Feel So Bad&quot; and &quot;If Things Were Perfect&quot; just as much. The last track &quot;My Weakness&quot; is pretty moving too. Any one with an open mind, or an interest in the genre should dig this. His other albums are good as well, but I suspect this is his best.
1881273156|5.0|Someone recommended this book and I bought it.  I'm really glad that I did.  After reading this book, so many things just made sense.<br />I get sad when I don't get time spend with me.  My main love language is quality time.  I know that know and I can be specific in making requests for what I want and what makes me feel loved.<br />I like how the book has a religious base, but it isn't 'preachy'.  It was also easy to understand.  There are examples that clearly illustrate anything that may not make sense in the text.<br />Share this book!
B0000028M7|4.0|As much as I love &quot;Jar Of Flies&quot;, this is their best album. It's just track after track of pure meaty grunge. &quot;Nirvana&quot; were a bit more punk, and &quot;Soundgarden&quot; were a bit more metal, but &quot;Alice In Chains&quot; to me, were nothing but grunge, and &quot;Dirt&quot; is a perfect album title. This had a few huge songs, including &quot;Them Bones&quot;, &quot;Rooster&quot;, &quot;Down In A Hole&quot;, and &quot;Would?&quot;, which was also on the &quot;Singles&quot; soundtrack. Of course the other tracks on here rock just as much. &quot;Junkhead&quot; and &quot;Rain When I Die&quot; are two other favorites of mine. This band was always a little dark and mysterious, which is part of what made them special, and they are sorely missed. Fortunately, &quot;Jerry Cantrell&quot; continues to carry the torch.
B00004Z4WR|2.0|Simple story lines are not a problem.If they are handled well ie:KillBillvol.1, a film with a simple story line can be very entertaining. (This film apparently did entertain a majority of the people who saw it, judging by the reviews here.)But a director, an editor,and actors must back it up. Well, one out of three aint gonna get it. The actors do their part,and what a great cast. But direction and editing (esp.editing) kill this film for me.<BR>  Let me give the biggest and most continuous example:<BR> scene: carchase ie; one car chasing another thru downtown L.A.traffic. One of these cars is a Shelby Cobra, one of the coolest muscle cars of all time. Here is what we see,<BR>close-up of Nicholas Cages eyes<BR>front wheel turning left<BR>hands on the stering wheel<BR>peoples heads turning as a blur goes by<BR>.03 sec shot of the Shelby sliding into turn<BR> more close ups of actors behind the windshields<BR>     Anybody see whats missing here, hello, the cars inthe CAR chase. Some earlier reviewer said this was the best car chase movie since \\"Bullitt\\",let me recommend a little aussie film called \\"MAD MAX\\". Even \\"Smokey and the Bandit\\" has better car scenes. I could go on but I'v made my point. <BR>  The action is so horribly clipped,cut,and blurred that I didnt care.
B00005R1N3|4.0|Ever wondered where films such as Friday the 13th, Scream, and all those obnoxious late night horrors got their ideas? Specifically the hidden, knife weilding psychos. Black Christmas is the correct 2-word answer. <BR>It starts when a person (seen from his POV) sneaks into a sorority house. When I first heard this I thought of the slasher/cheerleader/sorority house movies (very bad) and cringed. But Black Christmas turned out to be anything but.<BR>Black Christmas made no big splash when it first came out, but now a days its considered a significant part of horror cinematic history, because more than a few big time horror flicks have used some of the fear inducing elements of this film. When me and my boyfriend watched it we kept saying, \\"Oh I recognize that!\\" and it was very fun to see the untamed original form of some of these devices.<BR>The film lets you get to know the characters though (unlike modern slasher flicks)  - from the pregnant Jess who is considering abortion, to the foul mouthed, alcoholic sorority matron. Quite a few interesting characters live in this sorority house. And then BAMN, they begin to get killed off, with the viewer rarely expecting the next victim,<br />A LIL SOILER ALERT<br />Black Christmas is one of the first &quot;mainstream&quot; slasher films. &quot;The Texas Chainsaw Massacre&quot; came out the same year, but awhile before both came Mario Brava's &quot;Reazione A Catenea&quot;. This was (debatably) the first slasher movie, and the friday the 13th series was based upon it. Black Christmas adds a depth of mystery - you never do find out who the killer is, or what his motives are. For some viewers this adds freakiness. Unlike newer slasher movies, where at the end the killer is revealed (and usually) dealt with.<BR>Remember those movies with the stranger calling and uttering obscene things into the phone with a dangerous altered voice? That part is a direct take off from Black Christmas - the first (horror) movie to use the phone as a method of terrorization. Part of the horror of the film is included in the strange phone calls. Just when you think everything is safe.... the phone rings. In the DVD version I've seen, some of the obscenities and lewdness of the calls are edited out (compared to the version I saw a long time ago). I've read on numerous websites that this was to make the film &quot;less offending&quot;. <br />Overall, it's an enjoyable watch. While it isn't superbly good and unsurpassable, its great to see the foundations of modern slashers. Be prepared for something a bit more serious and with a more refined style than your usual slasher. I only wish the ending had been more.... realistic. I never did understand why the police didn't search the attic....
6305311463|4.0|When this movie came out it was panned by the critics as pretentious cheese playing to the lowest denominator. With the exception of the \\"lowest denominator\\" they were right. This film oozes cheese, but man its fine gouda,and a sharp chedder. It is well made cheese,and despite a wonderful nod to the Russian space program, it is purely American cheese.If you hate our space program or blame America for all the worlds woes this is not the movie for you.<BR>  Michael Bay turns in great piece of work here which is not always the case, see\\"BadBoys\\"(stinky cheese). He develops characters with a minimum of exposition, and a maximum of well thought out imagery, and movement. His pacing while rapid is still smooth, and one can see and often times feel the action.<BR>    And yes there are moments of \\"telecommunication commercials\\"<BR>but hey, they were some of the best commercials of their time. <BR>  The acting is wonderful, turning what ordinarily would be stereotyped,boring characters into memorable ones.And yeah this movie can make those of us prone to, cry. <BR>  I love Tarantino, and all the other edgy directors out there, I love dark, cynical, politically incorrect(which this film is),sex and violence epics. But I feel sorry for anyone who cant just relax,pull out the crackers, and enjoy this cheese.
B000001FMX|5.0|Ah, the Dolls. More than any other band, they were the epitome of the rock 'n' roll lifestyle (them and The Stooges..but that's another story). They didn't just burn the candle at both ends--they used a blowtorch on the middle. All the drug-crazed, trashily androgynous, Rolling Stones-in-drag insanity of the New York Dolls was woefully short-lived, but the result was a breakthrough 1973 LP that was a huge influence on the future punk movement. The Ramones (guitarist Johnny Thunders was a friend of Dee Dee Ramone's) and the Sex Pistols (Malcom McLaren managed the Dolls before there even was a Johnny Rotten) probably wouldn't have existed without Johnny Thunders and David Johansen to show them the way.<br />Way grittier and wilder than their glam rock kin (David Bowie and T. Rex), the Dolls basically updated the early rock 'n' roll of Chuck Berry and Jerry Lee Lewis. What the Dolls lacked in instrumental prowess they made up for in reckless sexual abandon and crazy R&B swagger. Thunders' guitar is HUGE, sloppy, and manic, and his filthy riffs and solos are what make this album. But let's not forget the trashy wit and great singing of Johanson, Sylvain Sylvain's piano, Jerry Nolan's crashing drums, and bassist Arthur Kane...well, he sucked, but you barely heard him over the wonderfully shambolic boogie anyway.<br />The opener Personality Crisis establishes everything the Dolls were about--stomping piano, riproaring guitar, and Johanson's cocky swagger and crazy vocals. The 1-2-3 punch of Personality Crisis, Looking For A Kiss, and Vietnamese Baby is then followed by the short reprive of Lonely Planet Boy. The epic Frankenstein brings the rawk back, and it is immediately followed by the insanely addictive sing-a-long Trash. The album ends with Jet Boy, which hooks you with the biggest freakin' chorus ever. Filler? What filler? Every song rules. They're so good that you will almost forget about Todd Rundgren's godawful production. Almost.<br />The New York Dolls' first release ranks up there with The Stooges' Fun House and The MC5's Kick Out The Jams as the definitive proto-punk album. Barring that, it may be the greatest pure rock 'n' roll document EVER. You need this one.t release ranks up there with The Stooges' Fun House and The MC5's Kick Out The Jams as the definitive proto-punk album. Barring that, it may be the greatest pure rock 'n' roll document EVER. You need this one.
B00000G3PA|5.0|This movie tells the story about the world's worst nightmare: An asteroid threatens to destroy the earth! To make it not happen, 12 people have to become perfect astronauts during only 6 days! Among these brave men 2 of the cutest guys, Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck, are united, despite  their private differences! The long journey to the asteroid gets more and more gripping and exciting with the dangerous complications they have to get through. Will they be successful in their prideful mission???<br />All in all we adore the film with its emotional scenes and its beautiful, moving music. You can really enjoy the film and its a good idea for an evening with your friends.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I admit that at first I had no idea what to think when I first heard this album.  I had never heard music like this before, it blew me away.  I listened to the album once more, then again, then again, then again, and then again untill it was all I really thought about.  It really is that good, these songs are quite addicting.  I would recommend this album to anyone who is a fan of music; most definitely to those who are fans of At The Drive-In and/or Sparta. If nothing else at least check out a couple songs, I can guarantee this album does not dissapoint.
B00005JM1F|5.0|I love this movie!  I found a site where you can get tshirts and stuff with the Lambda Epsilon Omega logo on it (the frat they start in the movie) go to OldSchoolFrat_com
B000003TAW|5.0|When Weezer's self titled debut album came out in 1994, it was during a time when grunge had been dominating and bands like punk rock posers Green Day and ska turned power pop No Doubt were ready to dominate.  This album was a hit as well and catapaulted Weezer to success thanks to the monster hit (and well overplayed) single &quot;Buddy Holly&quot;, as well as the excellent and powerful &quot;Say It Ain't So&quot;.  Ric Ocasek's superb production allows the band's superb writing and playing skills to shine in other tracks like &quot;No One Else&quot;, &quot;Undone (The Sweater Song)&quot;, &quot;In the Garage&quot;, and the surprisingly moving closer &quot;Only in Dreams&quot;.  Nothing Weezer has released since has ever been able to match the sheer edginess and catchiness of their debut, and I for one doubt that any of their future material ever will.
B0001AP12G|5.0|&quot;College Dropout&quot; is one of the grandest collections of Hip-Hop songs ever assembled. They are truly deep and spiritual. His vocals aren't overdone and that's why it's refreshing. He doesn't need to create a character or alternate persona to carry the weight of the songs. He's just Kanye West and that's why I can relate to it. I would highly recommend this CD.<br />Favorite Song: Jesus Walks
B000063DFN|5.0|Ranking up there with &quot;Killers&quot; and &quot;Number of the Beast&quot; as masterpiece albums, Iron Maiden's &quot;Powerslave&quot; is a nearly flawless metal masterpiece from beginning to end.  A fan favorite as well, the album begins with the turbo charged &quot;Aces High&quot; and is followed by concert staple &quot;Two Minutes to Midnight&quot; which contains one of the most catchy and amazing choruses in metal history.  The instrumental &quot;Losfer Words (Big 'Orra)&quot; displays the band's technical skills, as well does &quot;Flash of the Blade&quot; and &quot;Duellists&quot;.  &quot;Back in the Village&quot; is the album's only weakpoint, but it is still a solid song, while the title track contains one of the best guitar solos to ever be heard on a Maiden album.  The epic 13 minute closer &quot;Rime of the Ancient Mariner&quot; is a fan favorite and it's easy to see why.  The guitars are absolutely nothing short of phenominal while Bruce Dickinson's booming voice will send chills down your spine while your banging your head.  All in all, metal rarely gets any better than this.
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye's debut is very soulful and spiritual. It's rare that you come across and artist who is not afraid to be themselves. The music is what soars to perfection on this CD, not the persona. Kanye's delivery isn't flashy, but it achieves its desired goal. Not a single song goes to waste. You will not be disappointed with this CD.<br />FAVORITE SONGS: <BR>We Don't Care <BR>Spaceship<BR>Jesus Walks<BR>Never Let Me Down<BR>Through The Wire<BR>Family Business<BR>Last Call
B000002H38|4.0|Anita,very good singer with a deep voice. Very nice album that all ages can appriciate.
B0000CFW87|5.0|I've had &quot;Closer&quot; since November and it has only gotten better. This is my first Josh Groban CD and I wasn't disappointed. David Foster has proved once again why he is one of the best. Every song is truly spectacular. It is refreshing to hear a voice with such strength and clarity.<br />It's a new kind of pop music, but that's okay. As long as it's good, I'm on board. I would highly recommend this CD. Buy with confidence.
6303471730|1.0|This Gemstone Entertainment VHS of McLintock! was very poor quality in sound and color. It had been edited and the voices dubbed over. I have quite a few Wayne movies and intend to get more but will be more careful to communicate and get more information from the seller before I buy. It was a new video.
B000000993|5.0|Undertow, is possibly one of Tool's best, the songs are just so much easier to listen to. The songs are of course Tool's, and when has Tool never done a fantastic job? These songs only span an average about 5 minutes, so you don't have the same lengthy songs we've seen in the future albums. Undertow, is just an album you can sit down and listen to, without much thinking. As for the others, &quot;Lateralus&quot; and &quot;Aenima&quot;, it's hard not to think too much. For the songs, I basically love them all. The whole album is hard not to enjoy. Please, buy Undertow. The only thing I wish to warn you about, is that the inside cover art might disturb you, as is the reason why this album has the PA.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|X2     (USA - 2003)    Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Super 35)  Theatrical soundtracks: Dolby Digital / DTS    Following an attempt on the US President's life by what appears to be a rogue mutant (Alan Cumming), the school for 'gifted youngsters' established by Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is raided by military factions opposed to the integration of mutants into American society. The X-Men are subsequently forced into a collaboration with their mortal enemy Magneto (Ian McKellen) to clear their names and destroy an all-powerful threat from humankind...    Opening with a scene-setting quote from Abraham Lincoln, followed by one of the most astonishing action set-pieces of recent years (underscored by the 'Dies Irae' from Mozart's 'Requiem'), and closing with an extended confrontation between Good and Evil that tops anything in the original X-MEN (2000), Bryan Singer's powerhouse sequel ups the ante in terms of spectacle and excitement, whilst simultaneously expanding and developing the radical subtext (a minority group forced to take a stand against prejudice) inherent in the original Marvel comic strip.     Beautifully filmed, and performed with gusto by a dedicated cast (including Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen and Brian Cox, relegating Patrick Stewart, James Marsden and Anna Paquin to secondary roles this time out), the narrative unfolds with bold precision, constantly surprising the audience with inventive visuals and heartfelt emotional drama (the mutant 'coming out' scene - played with knowing irony by young Shawn Ashmore - will resonate especially with gay viewers). Also, this is one of the few movies in recent years to use the Super 35 format in a defiantly cinematic manner, with none of the concessions to television which usually characterizes this 'fake' widescreen process.    Followed by X-MEN: THE LAST STAND (2006).
B00004XMS0|3.0|And why exactly are the two dreadful abominations by Joel Schumacher and Akiva Goldsomething even present in this set? I might understand it if Schumacher's &quot;Ratman For Never&quot; and &quot;Ratman is Robbin' the Franchise&quot; were thrown in for free - they would be bad &quot;bonus content&quot; that I wouldn't watch. But the price of this set means that the studio actually asks money for Schumacher's flicks!<br />Thanks, but I think I will pass and simply stick to my two simple DVD boxes with the two real Batman movies - &quot;Batman&quot; and &quot;Batman Returns&quot;. The set is not worth the price... if they actually want me to sit through Schumacher's entries, they better pay *me* for watching them, instead of expecting me to shell out money for an experience of being punished.
B00011RPB0|1.0|Maybe I didn't get it, but this movie was really a disappointment. All the hype and I was left wondering why??? Skip it...
B000056JYB|4.0|I remember when I bought this album back in 1969 that my favorite track was \\"Had to Cry Today\\". It still has the good riff, but the song feels a little too longwinded when listening to it today. The highlights for me are the other Winwood songs \\"Can`t Find My Way Home\\" ( both versions ) and \\"Sea of Joy\\" ( great violin solo by Rick Gretch ).<br /><br />Clapton`s \\"Presence of the Lord\\" is also a good song; maybe a little overrated. \\"Well Alright\\" sounds a bit dated today. Baker`s \\"Do What You Like\\" was always a bore, and it goes on for way too long, and actually spoils what could have been a great album.<br /><br />Of the bonus tracks on CD 1, both versions of \\"Sleeping on the Ground\\" are good performances. Reminding me of early Fleetwood Mac. The electric version of \\"Can`t Find my Way Home\\" is great. \\"Time Winds\\" is an instrumental track; okay but not particularly interesting.<br /><br />The rest of this CD release a long jamming, that some may find interesting, but most people will find pretty boring.<br /><br />If \\"Do What You Like\\" had been edited down to 4-5 minutes and the electric version of \\"Can`t Find my Way Home\\" + one or both versions of \\"Sleeping on the Ground\\" had been included on the original album, it would really have been a classic.
B000066C1N|5.0|ONE: I Will Always Return (Credits)<br />This one was quite likable. It starts abruptly, with quiet instruments backing up Bryan Adam's whimsical-type voice, which automatically makes you want to like it. The words are quite good, albeit, slightly unoriginal at parts; \\"now I know it's true, my every road leads to you\\" which have certainly been used before. But the tempo is good and the tune original. In the end, it's just rowdy enough to interest, and makes for a fine start to the soundtrack.<br />TWO: Here I Am (Beginning) <br />This is a great second track, mostly because it's a little more soothing than the first one. The music is toned-down somewhat, with a echoing quality as well. The words are both original and well-done. I liked it especially because it seems to ring the feel of a newborn horse, which is the scene it's played for in the movie. Charming!<br />THREE: This is Where I Belong<br />I actually liked this track better than ONE, though I'm not sure why, considering a lot of the words are the same. I liked the tone more, I think. ONE is rather chop-full of rowdy music, whereas this track seems beautifully sincere; more the majestic of horses it was meant to be. Between the excellent lyrics and piano solo, it's an easy favorite.<br />FOUR: You Can't Take Me<br />It's exciting. With the sudden build-up of the music after some brief drum-beating, you're automatically wanting to like it. The chorus is stimulating with fast lyrics that make you want to tip back and lip-sync. Good words too, considering they seem rather 'obstinate'. Very cool, this one.<br />FIVE: Get Off My Back<br />This one is more fun than anything else. I guess it's mostly because the corresponding scene in the movie was so hilarious. True, with words likes \\"get off my back\\" it does seem a song you don't want to be singing much. In the end, however, it's fun, and the lyrics aren't all that bad. Bouncy, exciting, lip-sync material.<br />SIX: Sound the Bugle<br />With a title like \\"Soundthe Bugle\\" one doesn't expect this to be interesting, they expect 'Yankee Doodle'. But this song is actually a very sad and touching one. Starting with the lonely piano solo, you get the feel of it. Not depressing, but pleasingly emotional. Starting with words like \\"now I can't go on, I can't even start, I've got nothing left, just an empty heart\\" and then ending with the hopeful reminder of one's identity, \\"remember who you are\\". Beautiful.<br />SEVEN: I Will Always Return<br />Again, quite familiar lyrics, but with a very different tone. I liked the feel of this track; it's more soothing than the first one, and has more of the rhythm of THREE, which really fits the movie quite well. Good to listen to!<br />EIGHT: Don't Let Go (with Sarah McLachlan)<br />This one senses the ethereal. It's a mellow sort of tone that has just enough beat to keep you from drifting into a daydream...or sleep. The words are good; it's the most romantic song on here, and Sarah and Bryan's voices mix together beautifully with excellent harmony. Quite lovely.<br />NINE: Brothers Under the Sun<br />This one has a rather toned-down feel to it as well. It's not all that long, but it puts across a neat idea; \\"you are my brother under the sun\\". Between poetic lyrics and original music, this is an awesome piece, definitely worth a hear! I listen to it over and over. It's quite soothing.<br />TEN: Rain (all music)<br />This one; lovely. It starts out quietly with a basic theme on wooden instruments, giving a very innocent lighthearted feel. It then picks up some, but never becomes too deep for the care-free theme. Peppy and anything but too deep or shallow.<br />ELEVEN: Fly Like an Eagle (all music)<br />A very spirited piece that makes you want you to run as fast as you can. It's an open and somewhat empty piece, but it's so enthralling with its own beats and drums that this track draws you right in. You can listen to it easily.<br />TWELVE: Run Free (all music)<br />This is one beautifully adventurous theme you're sure to be humming to yourself an awful lot. It's a deep and fulfilling piece that seems to resound of a story of someone, and their journey. Again, it makes you want to run as fast as you can across a huge, open space. You can also hear snatches of the other themes throughout it's changing tempos. Exceptionally brilliant, and deserving of its length.<br />THIRTEEN: The Long Road Back (all music)<br />This one is even longer than TWELVE, and at times it may seem to drag, but it too has a style that is quite lovely, and you can still hear pieces of the other themes and tunes amidst the rest of the orchestra, which keeps it easily in-line with the rest of the CD.<br />FOURTEEN: Here I Am (End)<br />I can't rave enough. It's a fulfilling tune that goes exactly where you wanted it to, with a steady beat in the background keeping you pepped throughout it. Well-written lyrics and an addicting melody makes for a fabulous song for any listener. The best!<br />FIFTEEN: Nothing I've Ever Known<br />This was a neat, quiet and yet steady sort of way to end off the CD. It's the more lonely charm of the movie, Spirit, with an echoing quality that makes you daydream. Moving and intricate, an excellent end to this soundtrack.<br />OVERALL: The Spirit Soundtrack<br />All-in-all, it was quite professional. Between Hans Zimmer's 'brilliant-as-always' compositions that bring originality and intelligence, and Bryan Adam's 'breath-of-wind' voice which adds consistency and depth, this makes for an excellent listen for anyone.<br />I don't find disappointment likely for this Soundtrack.<br />RATING: 5 stars<br />I considered removing one star due to some of the slower moments, but decided that they were few enough that the Spirit Soundtrack deserves full marks. Each star was well-earned!<br />Cheers!<BR>~Chloe
B00000JKH2|5.0|Well i'm a huge atdi fan, been one for awhile and i can say that this is one of the best cd's they put out. It might only have 7 songs but who cares, these songs are sick!!<br />01 .  Rascuache--One of my favorite songs by this band, just an awesome song, the way its put together everything flows perfectly. On a scale of 1-10 i'd give this song a 15, its sweet!!<br />02 .  Proxima Centauri--This song kinda starts out alittle weird, kinda gives you that &quot;What the hell?&quot; type feel, but trust me it gets into a good song. Its just another perfectly put together song. 9/10<br />03 .  Ursa Minor--A mellow song, some nice breakdowns towards the middle, the drumming is awesome towards the middle too. All in all a good song 9/10<br />04 .  Heliotrope--This song is awesome, its pretty fast to start out with then breaks down to a slower pace but picks right back up. Awesome awesome song. 10/10 <br />05 .  Metronome Arthritis--This is such a sick song!! Its perfect, i really enjoi this song a lot. Kinda mellow, but at the same time its intense. 10/10 <br />06 .  300 Mhz--This song really reminds me of The Mars Volta(another badass band you need to check out), just the way its played, its another winner 10/10 <br />07 .  198d--A slow song, but a perfect way to end. This is a slow song but i tell you it gets intense further into it. 10/10<br />Well i don't know if this helped or not but just check this cd out, i know its only seven songs but they are awesome everyone of em. A lot of people think this is the best CD atdi put out, and i won't disagree, it is an awesome cd, but i like all they're cd's and can't really pick one over the other they are all just incredible. If your new to atdi then pick this cd up as soon as you can and every other album they have!! You will not be disappointed, i swear.
B00005JKQZ|3.0|The protagonist John Nash,a mathematic genius,is so talented that he increasingly becomes pshycotic.During the movie the viewer becomes more and more confused and will not be able to understand &quot;A BEAUTIFUL MIND&quot; straightaway.That is the reason for just 3 out of 5 stars.Russel Crowe presents in an amazing way the illness of John Nash.To my mind you have to see the movie at least twice to understand this masterpiece.<BR>My recommandation:do not despair during the movie because in the end you will check it all.It is worth to see it,but not a must.
B0000931QR|5.0|This group is awesome. You will not be dissapointed. Very original sound. It's relaxing yet it's not boring. There DVD is also great. Also, I must say that Amaia is a babe!!!! She looks as good as she sings!!
B00005JMJ4|1.0|My dad and I just caught this thing in the theatre. Yawn. I'm sick and tired of these atmospheric, episodic, pointless &quot;art&quot; movies. Endless scenes of Tokyo, endless scenes of the characters staring into space, endless &quot;funny&quot; scenes of Murray and Johannson sitting there while someone speaks Japanese at them, endless scenes where they sample Tokyo's nightlife, endless scenes that seemed to have nothing to do with anything (e.g., the flower-arranging, the karaoke singing, the hospital visit) and NO PLOT WHATSOEVER. No tension, no character-building, no genuine bittersweetness. Why the heck was Johansson's character so attracted to Murray's? He looked like a walking corpse. And why was Murray praised so highly for this role? He was just playing the same character that he's always played, only more tired and worn down. I kept thinking he was a retired, burned out Peter Venkman from Ghostbusters. And if Johansson's character is so smart (recent Yale graduate), why didn't she bring some books and music along to kill time? Why isn't she at least surfing the net instead of sitting in her underwear staring out the window, feeling sorry for herself? Why doesn't she see if the hotel has some English-language guides to local museums or whatever? Did she make no plans at all when deciding to travel to another country? Geez. <br />Ordinary events can be interesting, but in fiction they have to have a point to them. Otherwise, who cares? Don't waste your money--or, if you're determined to see this movie, rent it first before buying it.
6304366086|4.0|Be aware that this is a Pan and Scan version of the film, a fact that is omitted in the product description. As a result, many scenes that were thrilling in Cinemascope and awkward here. Nonetheless, I fully concur with other reviewers - this is a must have film for car buffs and racing fans.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|This cd is one of Dream Theater's finest.  They are quite possibly the most complex, yet melodic band out there today. The guitarist and the bass player are the best I have ever heard.  It is a shame that they do not get the recognition they deserve.  This is not a 3 chord band!
0385504209|3.0|don't expect to care about what happens to any of the characters.  Brown does not spend any time on character examination; you know little about each character's history and care even less. The book is a well constructed mystery, however; the plot moves along so quickly its reminiscent of a Hollywood movie and frankly, could have almost been written as a screeplay. In addition, it appears that some of Brown's research is flawed.  The scariest part of this book is knowing, absolutely, that some non-Christians will believe it to be based on fact which it absolutely is not....
0446607274|5.0|Angels Flight was one of the best in Connely's Harry Bosch series.  You can't put this book down!<br />While the whole series up to this point has been excellent, I think this book is going to stand out for me, even after I read the last three, as one of the best (out of 9).  This book just had the right combination of everything- suspense, murder, drama, intrigue, mystery, excitement and twists and turns.<br />In this book Bosch seems to come up against everything possible: fellow officers &amp; law officials, his wife and close friend, a city on the edge of rioting, more than one murder to solve and one of the most powerful families in LA.  Anyone who knows Harry knows he's capable of fighting anything though and winning.  And any fan of Connely's knows his writing is far above the rest.
B000003TAR|1.0|I don't know why SOOOO many teens these days think it's so cool to like Nirvana , like what are they one drugs? , yeah they probably are or maybe they think Kurt Kobain is so cool . Kurt Kobian was an idiot and shot heroine in his veins too much he f*cked himself over. The guy had a total problem and therefore he ain't cool at all. The music is a bunch of annoying sounds which I personally can't stand , I listened to this album at a party , whoa it sucked. Nirvana really suck
B000002UA9|5.0|So here it is, the legendary first Beatle record, knocked out in 14 hours. Depending on who you believe, it's either the greatest album of all time or a crappy slab of vinyl which in no way suggests the later genius of the band. While I agree with neither, I certainly lean closer to the former. That's right, shout all you want about &quot;Chains&quot; (which is infectious if you let it take you over), &quot;Boys&quot; (which is a lot of fun, really) and &quot;A Taste of Honey&quot; (alright...that's just crap), but truly, there is some great material here. &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; and &quot;There's a Place&quot; are some of the best songs John and Paul would ever write together and, when it comes to covers, &quot;Anna&quot; and &quot;Twist and Shout&quot; contain some of John's most passionate singing. Ringo's on key here but George hasn't really flourished into the great guitarist he later became. But Please Please Me was a breath of fresh air in 1963 and still has the power to please today.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Well, as the reviews here show, you'll either like or hate this movie.  And if you hate it, you'll hate it with a passion.  Which goes to show that there's probably something to this little movie that would drive them to such passion than those who tear it up are willing to admit.  That's usually a sign of a movie worth seeking out.<br />This is a very quiet little movie about two individuals who meet up for a few days in Tokyo and how they come to like, understand, and - through no intention of their own - find that they love each other.  <br />For those looking for some deeper meaning than that sometimes we can't predict how or why we end up being with those we call our friends, then perhaps this isn't the film for you.  For those looking for something out of the ordinary that isn't just the typical &quot;meet-cute&quot; cliche-heavy romance, give it a shot.  This and American Splendor are probably the two best films of 2003.
B00000K19E|5.0|*cricks neck* ok here's my rant...this movie is the god of movies. it set the way for all special effects after it. if you haven't seen this movie...WAIT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN IT!?!?!?!? thats like a sin. its one of those movies that your life won't be complete without seeing. a lot of people are saying that the sequels sucked and all that. but really they are just jealous, because there have never been anything like this trilogy, EVER! <br />bottom line (literaly): SEE IT, BUY IT, LOVE IT
6305508550|4.0|Well, I've heard about this cult classic film since I began working in corporate America.  It seemed that everyone quoted this movie, from the &quot;Didn't you get the memo?&quot; to the famous fax machine scene.<br />I finally got my turn with it last night and was in tears with laughter.  The opening scene with gridlock traffic voiced the pain of millions of commuters and showed the promise of more venting to come in the movie.  With my recent move to cubicle land, I was ready and waiting.<br />To my surprise, this movie actually had a plot.  They developed very humorous office parody in the opening scenes, but I expected that parody to go on for a long time.  Instead, the movie introduces the 3 parallel storylines: <BR> - anticipated lay-offs at work with consultants being brought in<BR> - Peter's experience with a career hypnotherapist (he's the main character)<BR> - Milton's being pushed to the brink of insanity<br />As the story unwinds, the characters show what ordinary people can do when put in almost inhuman conditions - working on top of people, boring work that doesn't really contribute to anything, inane bosses, an absence of any incentive to work harder, having 8 different bosses, lay-offs not based on merit, being asked to move cubicles continually, etc.<br />More than anything, I appreciated the films ability to continually laugh at itself.  When the 3 main computer science guys consider money laundering, they have to look it up in the dictionary...and they ask how smart guys like them can be so bad at crime when so many stupid people in the mafia are so good at it.  These guys are who we would be if we were stuck in that situation.  Sure, we've heard all about money laundering and such, but who knows how to actually do it?<br />While the movie winds down to a predictable and satisfying ending, I think it works well for this film.  I don't think the magic of the film is its proposing an answer for the white collar worker.  (Ditch digging anyone?)  Instead, I think the genius of it was to express and magnify to humorous proportions the lives of many Americans.  It does this well, and thus earns four stars (especially when all the swears are bleeped out).
B0001AP12G|5.0|This album generated a lot of hype through two lead singles, one of which i didnt particularly care for(slow jamz).  I love Kanye's producing so I copped the CD, and was amazed at the ingenuity and originality he displayed.  Hearing Common's return to spitting fire alongside Talib Kweli (Get em High) was absolutely amazing.  Not to mention the pairing of Mos Def with Freeway on (2Words) in which they spit bars or stanzas of two words throughout the entire song.  It was a brilliant rhyme scheme.  Kanye held well with lines such as (Yeah im coming with lyrical $hit, mayonnaise colored mercedes I push miracle whips) and other clever metaphors.  He can hold his own in rhyming, and producing, and putting them together? Quite a feat.  One bad note, the skits were funny, but too many of them.<BR>Greg
B00000295A|5.0|this album is more jazzy.  I have really come to love the beats and the bass rifts.  Good horns, good singing.  Just makes me want to dance.  I would call it psycedelic, but this is much tighter
B00011RPB0|5.0|I have always searched for platonic love movies, but alas, I am disenchanted by the forever &quot;getting people in bed by the end of the movie&quot; movies. Since young I always had relationships with guys and it was refreshing to see the poignant touch Bill M. put to the part. He showed the restraint of someone who respected youth too much to just bed down with it and the young actress Scarlett who played the young (and felt abandoned wife) took the role and played it as a girl who was actually more mature than her years. She felt Bill M's Character needed some emotional company and gave it to him, not lending physical love but emotional love instead. These relationships exist in real life but Hollywood always seems to get over themselves and get these people into a rating grabing bed scene. Sometimes that doesnt happen in real life. Thank goodness director Sophia understands that. I recommend this movie to any young adult and older adult who want to relate but have the wall between them not allowing them to....This one is a keeper

0385510438|3.0|Grisham weaves a book that is comfortable to read but which provides no suspense and no mystery.  If you've ever wondered whast it would be like to live in a small Mississippi town in the 1970s (sitting on the porch, sipping sweet tea after a home-cooked meal) then you'd appreciate this book. It doesn't get much more exciting except for a snippet here and there.
B00006LLNU|1.0|This album is not even mediocre- it's simply bad. After about three songs I just couldn't take it anymore. The high pitched distorted voices in the background have the same disturbing effect as a mosquito buzzing in your ear. The melodies are very plane and lack sophistication. It almost sounds like a child toying with a piano, repetitively playing the same four random keys. Don't buy it.
6301095294|4.0|I can understand why Magical Mystery Tour has been the victim of so much harsh criticism.   One thing that film purists may complain about is the amateurish style of the camera and editing.  However, Paul himself pinpointed the biggest trouble with the film back in the day:  people were looking for a plot, but there wasn't one.  But Magical Mystery Tour isn't a \\"regular\\" movie.  The beauty of this film is that it's a complete fantasy and therefore a real, developing plot isn't necessarily needed.  One legitimate shortcoming of the film is that it is a Beatles movie, yet it's actually not self-indulgent enough.  The Beatles admitted that they were like bit players in their own movie, which is mostly true.  The Beatles, along with Mal Evans, each play a character on the bus (only Ringo's character has more than a few lines, though) as well as the \\"4 or 5 magicians\\" who cause the magic to happen.  (John also serves as narrator, among a couple other one-scene characters.)  The other characters get about equal exposure as the Beatles (not including the songs themselves).  It's been put around that, because Magical Mystery Tour was largely Paul's idea, the movie revolves around him, which is completely untrue--I don't believe that his \\"bus\\" character even says one word on-screen thoughout the whole movie.<BR>Magical Mystery Tour is less than an hour long.  There are a few scenes which are a bit too silly, but there's also plenty which are enjoyably funny:  pretty much anything Ringo says to his auntie, Victor Spinetti's two-minute mumbo-jumbo speech, and, of course, the spaghetti dream.  Naturally, however, the highlights of the film are the songs!  The Beatles had been making promotional films (AKA \\"music videos\\") for their singles for over a year, and the visuals for these songs were the best-looking yet (the sequences for \\"Fool On The Hill\\" and \\"Blue Jay Way\\" are particularly stunning).  If you need any proof that the Beatles spearheaded the style of music videos we know today, then watch Magical Mystery Tour!
B0000AQVCL|4.0|I'm pleased to see that there is finally a group that is bringing back that classic rock sound with a great 2000's infusion. Definately worth the money I paid for it. This group doesn't seem destined to be a one hit wonder. Catchy tunes, and memorable lyrics.
B000002IKR|5.0|Most consider New Order to be the best of Testament's albums.  While I agree that New Order is awesome, I'd have to say that The Legacy is the best they've done.  They wouldn't be this fast or heavy again for quite awhile.  Alot of people state that Testament where trying to mimmick Metallica with their debut.  Whoever is saying this is should get a spoon and clean the funk out of their ears, coz if I had to compare it to anything at all, I'd compare it to Slayer.  It is quite unfortunate that Testament never got the popularity and recognition of their peers.  Sure, Testament weren't breaking any new ground with their debut, but it's solid and well done thrash.  I don't know why, but I chuckle when Chuck yells, \\"the devil's triangle!\\"  Click \\"yes\\" for Helpful if you think this is funny too.  So, if you only buy one Testament album, I'd tell you to get The Legacy.

1577311523|5.0|This is one of the books I have been waiting for. It explains at great length with regard to the concept of ego. If you have a lot of weird behaviours that you yourself cannot understand why you do so, this book is the answer. What a wonderful work!
B000000H5J|5.0|Every once in a while it's good to review the classics of metal. I already reviewed one classic in Pantera's Far Beyond Driven, and now it's time to review another. The industrial scene and death metal scene, at the time, were practically, two different scenes. Fear Factory had just released one album, Soul of A New Machine, that was very influenced by Napalm Death with some keyboards. With Demanufacture, FF took it one step further, taking the industrial music of NIN and Ministry, and combining it with the thrash of Slayer and Cannibal Corpse. <br />The first track, the title track, begins with an effect that sounds like a machine. Then Raymond's double bass comes in, followed by Dino's machine gun riffs. Then when Burton starts screaming, you're going nuts. It's like a machine gun to your head. &quot;Self Bias Resistor&quot; is like stop-and-go NASCAR. It's fast, then it stops. The drumming of Raymond is unbelievable. His double bass skills is ungodly. He would be just as good if he didn't use triggers. We also get a first look at Burton's melodic singing on SBR. He's so intense in the verses, and then he sounds like a choir boy in the chorus. &quot;Replica&quot; is probably the most melodic track on here, or probably &quot;Dog Day Sunrise&quot;, but those two tracks are perfect for Burton's singing.<br />My favorite track, is probably &quot;H-K (Hunter-Killer).&quot; I don't know what part of the story it is (just in case, you didn't know, Demanufacture is a concept album, more on that later), but it's perfect for a circle pit. Burton goes ape on the track, while the band is accompinened by synths. The chorus shows Raymond unleashing a great 16-note double bass part that pounds you into the floor. This songis probably the perfect example of where FF was going. Anyways, like I said earlier, this is a concept album. I believe it's about the end of the world in some way. It's similar to Obsolete, and Obsolete comes with a story, so it's easier to understand.<br />Anyways, if there's anything wrong with this Cd, it's the last two bonus tracks. These are only on the digipak version of Demanufacture. It's pretty much a remix of tracks 4-5. I never understood why FF did this with the whole remix thing cause it's really pointless. Anyways, pick this up if you haven't. Not only is it brutal, it's also musically, vocally, and lyrically amazing.
0060930349|5.0|This work is impressive. To figure out if you want to commit the time to sift through this nearly 1,000-page tome, first read the last part of his book and skim through the sections you have living memory of (Carter, Reagan, Bush, Clinton) to see if his analysis of recent history matches your own. If it does then you're going to have an enjoyable romp through American history with Johnson as your time travel guide. If it doesn't, put down your Howard Zinn and read Johnson anyway for a thoroughly researched, refreshing and energetic retelling of one of the greatest epics ever told.<br />This book is for the news junkie who feels trapped in the present and wants to get a better grasp of America's origins but is too embarrassed to sit through another round of high-school AP History. Johnson assiduously untangles strands of history that seem to have been politicized or distorted for whatever reason, demolishing long-held myths, vindicating key people, and offering quirky information that will certainly improve your performance on Jeopardy.<br />Despite the right-leaning biases he sprinkles throughout the book, he's consistently fair-minded in his analysis from the treatment of the Indians, causes of the Civil War, to today's media industrial complex. Also, in spite of his distillation of America's key events this work is appreciatively expansive in its scope. Often he breaks from the timeline story telling either referring back or fast-forwarding to other events capturing critical themes in his exhaustive effort to make sense of America's story. As you read this you get the feeling that Johnson is a mad perfectionist obsessed with leaving no pebble unturned in a vast forest.<br />In a time where skepticism in America is fashionable, it is assuring to see an Englishman, an outsider, believing that there are lessons from the growth of our nation that can benefit the world. This is an important work and a must read for everyone.

B000021XS0|5.0|This stunning concept album combines the flare and blinding skill commonplace in Dream Theater albums with compositional mastery rare in the modern music world. Its blending of modern rock bases with classical symphonic themes set it above most albums and among the greatest of all time. Not only should we appreciate this album for the musical brilliance it provides us, but we should each also thank the members of Dream Theater and their management for such a wonderful musical experience.
B0000C9ZLD|3.0|i think &quot;more of the same&quot; basically describes this album.  There are no surprises.  All of the songs sound similar and i have to keep checking the track number to make sure which song it is.  There is very little unaccompanied music, most of the time there is singing except the few bars at the beginning or at the endof the song.  But it is still pleasant to listen to it sometimes, if you want to listen to some up-beat indie rock.  But there is little individual style in it.
B00000JTB2|5.0|Two masters of their craft get together to create some stunning blues that are a joy to listen to over and over again!
B00005KFUM|5.0|Comparing to other albums of Muse, i'd rate Origin of Symmetry as 4 stars.  But comparing to other bands, this is definitely 5.  My expectation of Muse is so high that i have to give them a 4, becuase here there is less variety.  Most of the songs are up-beat with lots and lots of loud elec guitar.  It is only on tracks 8 and 11 that you get to have a rest from that.  Perhaps they could have included a couple of other slower songs.  The songs are great on their own, but in the album as a whole, it is too hyper, i think.  <BR>New Born, Micro Cuts, and Citizen Erased are among my favourites.  As usual Matt's falsetto is fantastic (particularly in New Born).  <BR>In Bliss the lyrics do not really match the music.  The music is dark whereas the lyrics are joyful.  But in Citizen Erased there is complete accord between the two.  The first time he sings: \\"i'm sure i used to be so free\\" the music suddenly relaxes as if you're unchained from some fort of burden that was bringing you down.  <br />There is wonderful piano section in Space Dimentia, and dreamlike organ in Megalomania.  If one doesn't listen to this album, he/she is missing too much.
B00013RC8O|4.0|\\"Vanishing Point\\" is a film that follows a very powerful storytelling device: tell the audience where the story ends, then take them there.  We know Kowalski's fate before the film begins and yet still we find ourselves rooting for his victory.  In the film, Kowalski sets out on an impossible mission: make it from Denver to San Francisco in a matter of hours while evading the cops.  Along the way, we get glimpses of Kowalski's past, a history of disenchantment with war, the government, the system, etc.  This disenchantment is picked up by those who support \\"the last American cowboy's\\" journey.  His quest for speed comes to represent his defiance of authority and his path to victory.  On one level, Kowalski becomes the sacrificial victim at the cost of losing a bet and a few speeding tickets.  On a different level, Kowalski's quest becomes a path to freedom and, in the end, complete freedom.<br />\\"Vanishing Point\\" does not have an excess of dialogue.  This film could have been a silent picture for all intensive purposes.  The themes and storyline are so simple and clear that one does not need much dialogue for the story to unfold.  With some great shots of the 1970 Challenger and some gorgeous countryside and flatlands, \\"Vanishing Point\\" makes for a great film for all car enthusiasts and those who enjoy a more artistically driven film than most.
B00001SIES|5.0|This is one of the best CDs i've heard.  What makes it particularly marvelous is the fact that it's a debut album.  It doesn't happen often that a debut album is very good.  But Muse have made a superior one.  All of the songs are just great.  Particularly, Unintended, Muscle Museum, and Uno are simply fantastic.  Although this is just their first album they have already moulded their own style: wonderful falsetto, great contrasts (e.g. in Uno and Showbiz), and amazing piano sections (e.g. in Cave, Fillip).  This is one of the best CDs of punk alternative.
B00005JM1F|4.0|\\"Old School\\" is quite simply a blast.  The cast for this film is phenomenal, but Will Ferrell steals the entire show.  He takes every scene that he appears in, hands down.  The idea for this film is quite original. I agree with the reviewer who remarked that the comedy in this film is quite fresh until it becomes a classic \\"beat-all-odds\\" competition at the end.  There is never a dull moment.  As with any modern comedy, there are many inconsistencies and storylines that are not completed or followed out: Wilson sleeps with an underage girl without consequence &amp; Ferrell's divorce that passes without a problem or second mention.  But following these storylines would have detracted from the central pivot of the film: the second coming of the fraternity.  Before watching this film, I thought much of the comedy would focus upon this fraternity.  But the comedy that exists in the tangential storylines is enough to carry the entire film.<br />\\"Old School\\" is an exciting and fresh comedy.  Don't come looking for intellectual dialogue or witty humor.  Come to watch Will Ferrell create, once again, a remarkable and memorable character.  This DVD edition is worth the rent and the documentaries are fun and interesting.
B000069AUI|2.0|i don't understand how this album is getting such good reviews.  This is one of the few albums that i had to sell becuase i thought it was just horrible.  The piano is just like bang bang, playing the chords and bascially nothing more.  The lyrics are all right, but the singing makes me wonder if they're sincere.  Too many times &quot;open up your eyes&quot;.  This is just bad.  The fact that the artist is Coldplay does not necessarily mean it's a good album.
B0000C7PQK|4.0|Enigma is and always will be a staple in my music collection. Their latest album adds a whole new dimension to their sound, using intriguing lyrics and catchy interims like &quot;Boum-Boum&quot; to keep the album flowing. I enjoy Enigma because their music touches me on a very deep level, beyond the scope of most pop music. This album is a shift in consciousness, and I love it.
B000000JO3|5.0|one word to describe this cd---awesome!!! its hardcore, fast-paced punk that is a total must have! filled with great songs like &quot;i don't wanna hear it&quot;, &quot;screaming at a wall&quot;, &quot;bottled violence&quot; and &quot;straight edge&quot; (my personal fave) you definitely won't be disappointed! if you're really into punk, especailly hardcore, this is the cd for you, so what are you waiting for? go out and get it!!!

B000002H2H|5.0|In my opinion this is the first real Metallica album.  While Kill 'Em All displayed the speed and aggression that would power Metallica ahead of all other thrash bands it just had something missing.  This album pulls it all together!  The lyrics are incredible and Ride the Lightning adds melody to the speed and power of their songs creating a lethal combination.  Metallica improved on its sound with Master of Puppets but lost some of their edge.  Here are how i would rate the songs on Ride the Lightning:<br />1) Fight Fire With Fire - An incredible classical guitar intro that explodes into a fulfledged thrash classic.  Lyrics about revenge and nuclear armageddon add to the frightening imagery in &quot;Fight Fire With Fire.&quot;  Maybe Metallica's fastest and heaviest song to date.  James' best thrash metal vocals are displayed in this song.  8.5/10<br />2) Ride the Lightning - Probably my favorite song on the album and maybe my favorite Metallica song.  Kirk lays down an awesome solo in this one.  Note: Dave Mustaine wrote the chord pregression that is used throughout this song and can be found on &quot;Looking Down the Cross&quot; by Megadeth.  10/10<br />3) For Whom the Bell Tolls - A slower Metallica song.  This song to me always seems to lag behind the rest on this album in greatness.  While this song has great lyrics based on an Ernest Hemingway book.  Lacks the speed and intensity of other Metallica songs but a great intro saves it.  7.5/10<br />4) Fade to Black - Probably my all time favorite Kirk Hammett solo is the outro solo to this song.  Every time I hear this solo it sends shivers down my spine.  &quot;Fade to Black&quot;, written about suicide, may be the saddest Metallica song written and is and absolute metal classic.  9.5/10<br />5) Trapped Under Ice - An epic about a person drowning and freezing to death.  This song moves at a schizophrenic pace and Kirk comes through with a blistering solo in the beginning of the song.  Perhaps a hidden metaphorto drug addiction in this song... it's hard to tell.  9/10<br />6) Escape - My least favorite song on the album.  Moves a seemingly slow pace and the chorus makes me want to shoot myself.  I usually skip this one.  Lyrics about escaping from a world that tries to prevent you from being what you want to be adds to the dullness of this song.  5.5/10<br />7) Creeping Death - A song inspired by the movie &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;, &quot;Creeping Death&quot; adds an interesting element to the album.  &quot;Creeping Death&quot; is an allusion to the final plague bestowed upon the Egyptians, the Angel of Death, which came and killed the first born of every family that did not have lambs blood above their door.  While this song keeps up the speed and intensity of the other song it seems to add something extra to the album.  A blazing solo by Kirk and excellent rhythm by James makes this one of the best songs on the album.  9/10<br />8) Call of Ktulu - The worst of the instrumentals (exluding the bass solo on Kill 'Em All) in my opinion.  Picks up at the end of the song but cannot compare to &quot;Orion&quot; or the epic dedicated to bassist Cliff Burton that is &quot;To Live is To Die.&quot;  7.5/10<br />The second best Metallica album trailing only &quot;Master of Puppets.&quot;  I thought that Metallica needed to end &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; with one final punch like they did with &quot;Master of Puppets.&quot; (&quot;Damage Inc.&quot;) Besides that this album has James' best vocals to date and some of the best instrumental work displayed in all of music.  &quot;Ride the Lightning&quot; paved the way for Thrash Metal and continues to influence musicians today! Thanks James, Kirk, and Lars!  You've changed my life!  R.I.P. Cliff!
6302994063|5.0|Call it a \\"chick flick\\" if you want, but not within earshot of my dad or my husband. \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" is one of my father's top-ten favorite movies, and he's no pansy. He's a WWII vet, a retired commercial fisherman, a mechanical type who can fix anything -- pretty much a Man's Man in every way. My aviation-buff husband is another one who loves this movie, and he's a guy who'd rather get a root canal than watch a sappy romance.<br />We found the movie by accident. We'd planned to see an action flick, but it was unexpectedly sold out. Since we were already at the multi-plex, we figured we'd watch \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" because it was about to start (the sexy babe on the movie poster helped convince my husband that it might be worth a shot). This was in Burbank, California, where half the members of any given audience make a living in the film industry. As such, they're pretty jaded. Yet they nearly shrieked with laughter at the movie's maverick humor, and as \\"Rumba del Burro\\" played over the closing credits, the entire audience LITERALLY danced out of the theater after a long round of applause. It was the damndest thing we've ever seen.<br />Later, I bought the video and shared it with family and friends. Most of them raved about the movie so much that I ended up buying probably half a dozen copies for gifts. What's really amazing about the story is that it is 100 percent formula cliché - yet it breaks all the molds. It's sexy and sensuous without being promiscuous. It's ribald without the use of profanity. It's the kind of movie you can watch with your little kids, teenagers, your parents, and your grandparents, all at the same time - there are plenty of laughs for every generation, including \\"adult\\" humor that gently soars over the heads of children.<br />The moral of my story: DO NOT believe those who tell you this is a just another \\"woman's movie.\\" The argument could be made that it's actually a man's movie, since the fathers of the two main characters turn outto be the real heroes. In an era where pop culture makes men out to be buffoons, \\"Strictly Ballroom\\" is mighty refreshing. WATCH IT.
0440237688|5.0|The title of this review says it all. This was a fascinating story about a young boy and his surroundings. Forced to live in a town where everyone feels the same, and has no past memories to keep them happy, Jonah must take on his role as the receiver of all the old memories from a man he calls The Giver. He soon finds out what it is like to run, play, and be REALLY happy, and he can't stand to feel this way all by himself. So, he has to do something about it. It is hard for me to get through a whole book unless it is incredibly interesting, and I think I might just read this book twice! I recommend this book to anyone who is looking for an escape from his or her everyday world. After reading about what he lived through, our world doesn't seem so bad after all!
B00006690G|3.0|well, i really like Eminem but when i bought this i was very disappionted. the songs were somewhat boring, and even the track Without Me (which i loved when i heard it on the radio) grew old on me VERY FAST.<br />at first i thought that maybe i was just losing interest in Eminem, but i soon realized that The Eminem Show simply didn't have the angry, raw, dark, and interesting feeling that the Marshall Mathers LP did.i feel the reason why this is album did so well is because, you can see that Eminem was trying to get all of the teenybopper pop kids into his music so he simply cursed much less and brought a much lighter approach to his sound(Hailie's Song anyone?). i'm not at all saying that he was trying to lose his old followers, i just think he was trying to be more accepted in the pop world.<br />this still isn't at all a bad record. there are awesome tracks on here like White America, Sing For The Moment, and Business. also, there is your classic potty-mouth Eminem song Drips, which contains some hilarious lyrics.<br />overall The Eminem Show struck me as being alright, but quite overrated. i strongly reccomend getting The Marshall Mathers LP instead.<br /> 5/10
B00004TH7Z|5.0|Iron Maiden displays old form in their 12th studio album - 'Brave New World' with the return of lead vocalist Brue Dickinson to the band after his 7 year sabbatical. To be honest, I have been more of a Maiden fan than a Dickinson fan over the years and never warmed up to any of Bruce's solo albums which he released during his hiatus from Maiden. However, his return seems to have energized the band after the previous 2 dissapointing albums where Blaze Bayley was cast as the lead vocalist. Wickerman is a typical short and hard-hitting Maiden album opener that we have come to love. Blood Brothers and Nomad are wonderful ballads with some excellent lead/rythm guitar solos. Ghost of the Navigator is great cut with frequent beat changes that reminded me of 'Revelations' the classic from Piece Of Mind and the title track Brave New World is a perspective of a liberal environmentalist. But, the 2 best cuts of the album are on the so called side B tracks; Dream of Mirrors with it's a powerful lyrics and the gradual rise to it's crescendo will leave you breathless when it's done and Out of the Silent Planet will touch deep into the heart of any Maiden fan and surely doesn't deserve to be the 10th cut of the album. Overall, in spite of the shortcomings when compared to the great Maiden albums from the 80s this is a must buy for any Maiden fan
B0000DJZA5|4.0|Well, no matter what anybody says, if you're a fan, you gotta buy it and find out yourself. You've been hearing McCartney complain all these years. Lennon gave it his blessing.  I'll side with Lennon on this one. The first one was better, more fun, and you miss the missing bits. The only improvement is including &quot;Don't Let Me Down.&quot; &quot;The Long and Winding Road&quot; was longing, sad, and majestic before. Here's it's a nice &quot;little&quot; song. Doesn't even sound very sad. Different take. Changes in lyric  from &quot;You'll never know the many ways I've tried&quot; to &quot;You've always known...&quot; The first was better. And leaves out McCartney's &quot;Don't keep me waiting&quot; overdub I always listen for. The rest of the songs ain't  very different but you miss the bits. The song sequences were better first time too. This one starts off with &quot;Get Back&quot;. Too much too soon.   Spector is and probably was a nut  case. But this was probably the  job he took most seriourly in his  career. A Beatles album. That was  the top. And he did a great job.  Lennon was right. And McCartney  was right about most other things.  But, here, he just won't admit it.  But buy it and judge yourself.  Buy...buy....
B00018D44U|5.0|OK, so I am not a fan of country music, but this CD isn't country....a few songs have an old time country feel. Somehow Norah manages to choose really great songs and makes them her own.  I love this CD, and the more I listen the more I love it...even the country flavored songs. I'll admit, at first I was a little worried, but her voice, the words, the band...everything is great.  <br />I can't stop listening......if you loved &quot;Come Away With Me,&quot; you will love &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;!!
B000002HMH|1.0|this album stinks, the whole second side is bad. only two good songs on here \\"until it sleeps, and hero of the day\\". All you metallica fans have alot to learn about music because this is bad.
B0000AQS0F|1.0|I bought this DvD expecting it to be one of the best tv shows..i had ever seen, but i may have had too high expectations for this show...this show will appeal to the masses who enjoyed Star Trek, Stargate , and especially the people who enjoyed Star Trek Deep space nine. Firefly is similiar to Deep Space Nine and especially not to be mistaken for the next coming of Star Wars, it has some intrestinting characters but lacks plot orignality, many of the episodes lack suspense, some bland dialogue can be found as well. The show lacks alot of entertainment value aswell making a mistake on focusing on too many character at one time.The show is reminisent of anime cartoons from japan actually one of my friends pointed it out to me aswell. The show did have a couple bright spots like the semi-budding of a romance between Kaylee and Simon but not much came out of that. Fox did make a mistake for canceling , but if you are not a lover of sci-fi, i would not recommend not buying this dvd at all. Don't be fooled about the show not being a sci-fi tv show.
0385486804|4.0|The book started out not really interesting, but as it spanned out it became a factor the realistic feeling you get when he describes the adventures that he goes on and the description of this life great writer. The middle is some what of a tease but well worth reading. Might not be a type that you will understand first time reading.
0385504209|2.0|As other reviews have pointed out, the basic foundation for this novel is taken straight from the idea that the Holy Grail is actually Mary Magdalene in her role as Jesus's wife, carrying his child.  Brown adds nothing new to this legend (which is covered in detail in the book \\"Holy Blood, Holy Grail,\\" by Michael Baigent, et al), but uses it as the stage upon which his characters act out their parts.  The plot for the \\"Da Vinci Code\\" revolves around exposing some secret documents that will prove the legend true.  Unfortunately, the action is more Keystone Cops than adventure-thriller, and the writing is a bit tortuous in places.  One thing an author owes his readers is to make sure the plot devices work.  In this aspect, Brown fails miserably.  Central to the story is a gadget designed by Da Vinci called a \\"cryptex.\\"  It is a hollow cylinder (picture a tennis ball can) made of several cylindrical sections, each engraved with a series of letters.  The whole thing is held together in a mechanism so that the individual sections can rotate like a giant bicycle combination lock.  When the letters are aligned to a particular secret word, the device can be opened and the contents extracted.  Inside is a parchment scroll with the hidden information.  As it turns out, vinegar quickly dissolves parchment; so to safeguard against anyone just smashing the cryptex, the parchment is wrapped around a glass vial of vinegar.  Smash the cryptex, the vial breaks, the parchment dissolves, and the secret message is lost.  Much of the plot is built around attempts to decipher the code on the cryptex so it can be safely opened.  At various times in the novel, both the hero and villain have full possession of the cryptex, and engage in odysseys and research to try to figure out the code.  There is, however, a far easier solution than unscrambling the cylinders or smashing the cryptex.  All one would have to do is take a Dremel power tool with a small circular saw on it, and cut through the cylinders without breaking the vial within (a more high-tech solution would be to cut it open with a laser).  Why the \\"brilliant\\" characters never thought of this is a plot hole the Louvre could fall through.  But then, had they thought of it, the book would have been over far (and mercifully) sooner.cylinders without breaking the vial within (a more high-tech solution would be to cut it open with a laser).

B00012QM8G|5.0|I watched this movie in history class. There is no word that can describe the movie the black and white really pointed out the different in the movie and the history seems realistic. The tragedy of this movie is pointed out in a man who became rich because of the holocaust. There not much to say about this movie but watch it with out your kids and maybe bring a tissue box.
6305428352|5.0|I'd like to begin by saying that my rating for Mr. Holland's Opus is a 4.5.  With my love for this movie, I chose to round to five.  I think the reader deserves an explanation as to how I arrived at this number, because it's a bit unusual.  I recognize that some of the other reviewers have valid criticisms about things that were in the plot that perhaps didn't work as well as they could have, and if I graded this on that aspect alone, I'd award a 3.5.  What I gave back a full star for was the score done by Michael Kamen.  *Especially* in a film that is about music, this is integral to the experience, and I think Mr. Kamen isn't getting nearly enough credit here.  In fact, I would *very* much like to see a re-release of the DVD that, in the &quot;Production Notes&quot;, will include a vastly expanded section about Michael Kamen and the process of composing the score for this movie.  Any footage they have would be much appreciated--as it is, I cannot believe just how little attention was given to him and his work.<br />As to the plot...I have to say, I say unashamedly that I was and still am moved by it.  I'm not going to rehash exactly what happens because many people have already done that job for me; my focus in writing this is elsewhere.  I should like to make the point that in addition to the human element of the plot, it does point out a very important problem--the diminishing of music and art programs in our schools.  In fact, Richard Dreyfuss and Michael Kamen set up the Mr. Holland's Opus Foundation in an effort to help in this matter, something which I hope readers will take a look at.  I can say from my own experience that had I not had the great musical education in school that I was lucky enough to have, I would've missed out on a lot.<br />I only saw the movie a few times in the years since it was released, and as well as many details of the plot, the *impressions* of the music, even if not the note-for-note particulars, burned themseves indelibly upon my brain. Among my favorites are the powerful &quot;Iris&quot; theme, and the hauntingly beautiful &quot;Rowena&quot;. The latter is a tune that, upon seeing the movie a few weeks ago for the first time in years, became instantly familiar the second I heard it again--I felt as if I'd found a tune I'd been seeking for all the intervening time in my own musical meanderings. That, more than anything, ought to serve as a testament to what Michael wrote here.<br />The &quot;Finale&quot; now has a strange parallel meaning to what it held in the movie. The music program having been cut off suddenly, the students Glenn Holland has had over the years gather to give him a glorious send-off, and to prove to him that his career, even abruptly abbreviated as it was, had a tremendous influence. That influence is the legacy of him that they will carry in their hearts. So it is now with the man who was truly behind that music--Michael Kamen passed away very suddenly on the 18th of November, 2003.  But there is no doubt that through this, and many other things, he *will* have a fantastic legacy.  I truly hope you will open your hearts to the music and the memory...to know its power and joy.<br />--Written in memory of Maestro Michael Kamen
B00000JHAU|4.0|I bought this some time ago on a hunch and some good press I had read about them-I was amazed. The stories the lyrics tell are slightly subversive, but they are politely delivered for 34 year old suburbanites like me to enjoy with the volume low or moderate. My favorite, Stars of Track and Field builds from a simple acoustic guitar accompanying a voice, and the title track's vocals skip along wonderfully  with the nostalgic children playing in a schoolyard behind it.  MayFly sounds like a Housemartins song, and Judy and the Dream of horses is a Godsend with its triumphant horns bringing the album to a glorious close. I will certainly buy morte after this first taste, and am glad the musicians could not find proper jobs as the liner notes suggested they tried first.
B000065VA1|5.0|Just in case there are people out there who wonder, \\"What happened to all the great rock albums?\\"...well, here's one. Here's one of the best in fact, one of those pieces of art that guarantee immortality, for artist AND audience. I was in college when this came out in 1986 so I was practically duty-bound to buy it, but I'm happy to report that not all music beloved by college students is wimpy and stupid: there is such a consistency of mood on \\"So\\", even throughout such diverse tunes as \\"Sledgehammer\\" and \\"Mercy Street\\", that you can't help but feel you've had a real experience, a real connection to the artist. Peter Gabriel's music has always been intensely personal, from his earliest work with Genesis through his latest CD, and \\"So\\" is no different.<BR>So many of these songs became hits (\\"In Your Eyes\\", \\"Big Time\\", and \\"Red Rain\\" are here too) that it might be tempting to think of this as a randomly-sequenced greatest hits record...but don't be tempted. Like all great works of art this is a journey, and you can only get home on one road.
B000007638|5.0|With all due respect to Peter Frampton and Kiss, &quot;Wings Over America&quot; is THE concert CD of the 1970's. I am not generally a fan of live albums since there's absolutely no way to replicate the experience of really being there, but if there's one live album that comes the closest this has got to be it. Paul McCartney's good-vibe rock 'n roll blasts down all the cynical barriers you've built up over the years and plunks you right down in the audience with the rest of us, laughing and clapping and having a great time.<BR>Opening with a medly of &quot;Venus &amp; Mars/Rock Show/Jet&quot; and closing 2-plus hours later with two hard-to-find classics, &quot;Hi Hi Hi&quot; (a 70's song if ever there was one) and &quot;Soily&quot;, this album feels so much like a real concert I'm tempted to try a stage dive...but maybe that's just me. There are way too many highlights to name here, McCartney originals, Beatles tunes, a Paul Simon and a great rocker by Jimmy McCulloch called &quot;Medicine Jar&quot;...the songs flow effortlessly one to the next, and this has always been the secret of McCartney's appeal, that it all seems so effortless. Some criticize him for it, even one or two of his former bandmates, but listen: there's nothing wrong with feeling GOOD when you listen to rock and roll. Take a trip back to 1976 with &quot;Wings Over America&quot; and discover that great music THEN is great music NOW, and always. Thank you, Paul...Linda...Denny...Jimmy...and Joe.
B00005UW7V|3.0|It is impossible to deny that A.I. is one of the most visually innovative Hollywood movies of the last decade. Director Steven Spielberg has invisioned a futaristic society in which the boundaries of color, technology and imagination have been pushed farther than most of us primitive beings could ever imagine. Many of the images linger in the mind even as the plot and characters that gave them purpose fade from memory: the intensely colorful and decadent Rouge City, the submurged and decaying Manhattan, the terrifying and joyously deranged Flesh fair. It's a brilliant and riviting feast for the eyes that won't likely be equalled in the near future. <br />Now ask me I actually enjoyed the movie. Sadly, the answer would only be: sort of. Although Spielberg's script includes many moments of great genius, and the nuanced and restrained performances of Haley Joel Osmet and Jude Law are excellent, the film is ultimately a fractured marriage between two of the cinema's greatest filmmakers: Spielberg and Stanley Kubrick. It was Kubrick who first expressed the desire to transform this story of a robotic boy who can love into a film, and Spielberg who picked up the mantle of creation following Kubrick's death in 1999. Spielberg has obviously tried to be true to Kubrick's distinct style and flair, while also adding his own insights and interpretations to the material. Sometimes this partnership is a success, but all too frequently is causes the movie to waver uncontrollably and confusingly between Spielberg's sentimentality and Kubrick's cold meticulousness. It is the spirit of Kubrick who heartlessly leaves David at the bottom of the ocean staring blankly at a statue of the Blue Fairy, and Spielberg who awkwardly resurrects him for his cloying reunion with his mother. Ultimately, A.I. isn't really a bad film, but one that falls short of the standards both of these great directors have set in their previous works.
1401300901|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS I HAVE READ IN YEARS!  I Laughed one minute and cried the next.  A must read girly book!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|It  absolutey boggles  my  mind  every  time  I  watch this DVD  to  think  that  the ' brains'  ( and I use that word comically )  at  FOX  cancelled this show...it did make it easy for me to stop watching that channel altogether...This series is one of the most original and entertaining you'll ever see...ACTUAL Character development !!! What a concept...well, Joss'  shows always have that, as well  as  PERFECT casting, sets, lighting ( here it is almost a separate character  ) and  all other aspects...you won't regret buying this DVD
0312319517|3.0|In Avenger, Frederick Forsyth takes an updated look at how wealthy people may pursue private justice against terrorists.  In this case, the subject is war crimes in Bosnia and an escaped war criminal who is seemingly safe in a far-away country.  I was reminded of the attempts by Israeli agents over the years to capture Nazi war criminals in South America.<br />Rather than simply building up that story, Mr. Forsyth takes the time to tell you about the private agent, attorney Calvin Dexter, who undertakes to right such wrongs.  Dexter is a Paladin-like character who is a gun for hire for the side of the right.  For me, one of the most enjoyable parts of the book was how Dexter developed his skills in dealing with dangerous situations as a tunnel rat in Vietnam.  But the background of the main story took too long to develop.  That will only be justified if Mr. Forsyth now treats us to a long series of books about Calvin Dexter.<br />The end of the book is superb as Calvin Dexter takes on the security services of small countries and the war criminal.  I would have enjoyed the end more, however, if Mr. Forsyth had added a map to portray the scenes of the final adventure.  I occasionally had to reread sections to understand the layout of the land and compound.<br />Overall, I found myself feeling like the book was an average thriller.  It has long stretches when not much happens.  Thrillers need to get your heart pounding and never let up in order to be totally satisfying.  I also didn't find myself connecting too directly at an emotional level with the characters.<br />As I finished the book, I was intrigued by a question that Mr. Forsyth did not address.  How can one safeguard one's children if they choose to serve in dangerous situations abroad?  I hope that a future book by Mr. Forsyth will focus on that subject.
B0000AK7AC|1.0|Several previous reviewers are dead-on.  Babe, is of course, a clever, funny, touching movie.  It's one of the few movies that I and my 3-year old can both enjoy over and over.  But the marketing jerks at Universal have seen fit to force several lengthy advertisements on you every time you try to watch the movie.  What's more, they've coded them to be non-skippable, so you MUST sit through them every time you want to watch the movie (you can fast forward, but you can't skip over them).  This is offensive and intrusive in any dvd you've purchased (and arguably fraudulent as it's not disclosed on the package), but it's even worse with a movie like Babe that's targeted largely at kids.  First, it illustrates that Universal has outright contempt for parents' rights to decide what types of films are, or are not, appropriate for their kids.  Second, if you have a small child who really wants to watch Babe (or whatever), it's difficult for them to understand why they should have to sit through 15 minutes of Universal's marketing crap before the movie starts (something that's not true with numerous other children's DVD's).  Shame, shame Universal.  I'd encourage you to rent, download, pirate, or borrow this DVD rather than buying it, at least until Universal ceases its offensive, dishonest marketing tactics.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I thought that this movie was an expression of sophia coppela's first movie. There was realism and the shots of tokyo. I don't think that I have ever seen more of tokyo than this movie. It is is a breath of fresh air to see on site filming in a country where a movie is set. I honestly think that this film falls along the line of american beauty which was set in north jersey.<BR>The film warms me up as opposed to modern day films where sex and innuendo play a major part in the film.
B000002H33|5.0|Once upon a time, long before the travesty of St. Anguish, long before the pointless suing of Napster users, Metallica (along with Megadeth, Anthrax, and the almighty Slayer) ruled the metal world with an iron fist. And this album, Master Of Puppets, is their swan song. This is their Dark Side Of The Moon, their Aenema, their Dookie. In case you don't see what I'm getting at, THIS IS THEIR BEST ALBUM!!! Everything you could possibly want out of a meaty, clever metal album is here:<br />Solos.<br />Hard, fast-paced, crunching riffs.<BR>Breakneck beats.<BR>Snarling vocals that MEAN something. (You listening, Andrew WK?)<BR>Great ballads.<br />It all came together perfectly for this one.<br />Here's a song-by-song review:<br />BATTERY: Awesome opener. Begins with soft, classical-sounding guitars, then WHAM! It blindsides you with a fistful of metal, and it goes into a fast-paced rocker that gives you a good taste for the rest of the album.<BR>MASTER OF PUPPETS: The most powerful anti-drug message ever made. This song has actually kept me off drugs. The music itself is fantastic (hard and heavy, but then has a classical-style solo in the middle), and the lyrics are even better, ending with that haunting line, &quot;Now I rule you too!&quot;. Marvelous.<BR>THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE: A little slower (or mid-tempo). Nice and hard, with good vocals and riffs.<BR>WELCOME HOME (SANITARIUM): This might possibly be my all-time favorite Metallica song. It starts off as a ballad, then proceeds to raging speed metal. The ballad part is beautiful, and the speed metal part ROCKS. Awesome.<BR>DISPOSABLE HEROES: Pretty good song in the vein of Master Of Puppets (title track), with clever anti-war lyrics. Once again, great guitar work from Kirk Hammett.<BR>LEPER MESSIAH: Also not so bad, but probably my least favorite on the album. Good message, though. I still like it, it's a decent mid-tempo song.<BR>ORION: THIS is where the musicians of Metallica really shine (especially the lateCliff Burton... RIP). This is completely instrumental, and Cliff's bass work is outstanding. He will truly be missed.<BR>DAMAGE, INC.: Good, fast-paced song about destruction, in the vein of Battery.<br />Sometimes, I listen to this album, and I feel so sad because, unfortunately, they released St. Anger. (bleeeccchhhhh) Oh well, never mind that, because we'll always have their first five albums. If you're a metal fan and you don't own this, you're not a metal fan. So BUY IT! (or burn it, if you don't want to give Metallica your money, which I completely understand... just obtain a copy in some way or another, OK?)
B000001ESF|5.0|We're only 8 years from the title, but &quot;2112&quot; shows a tremendous amount of prescience in its treatment of the future. Neil really let it all hang out with his treatment of a future world which seems comfortable, well-manicued, but stark and sterile. Before there was Luke Skywalker there was the protagonist of &quot;2112&quot;, discovering an ancient power, unlocking a mystery, and defying the masters of society.<br />Heady stuff.<br />Like so many other early Rush pieces, the music of the &quot;2112&quot; suite runs the gamut from power chords to lilting tunes to heart-pounding rhthyms Alex spends a lot of effort ripping through you, only to bring the tempo down or slew it sideways when you least expect it. When all is said and done, you feel emotionally worn out. And so the band makes a brief stop to pick up some mood enhancers before moving on... ;)<br />&quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; is as good a rendering of what the show was like as anything and Geddy's hushed vocals (in contrast to the razor-sharp power of &quot;The Temples of Syrinx&quot;) bring it just the amount of spooky you need.<br />Not many will mention Rush and love songs in the same breath, but &quot;Tears&quot; is a poignant ballad nonetheless. It just points out the band's versatility.<br />Perhaps there are better Rush albums technically or spiritually but for my money there are none better emotionally. &quot;2112&quot; brings you on a trip you don't soon forget.
1563523302|5.0|I fully recommend this book. I was first introduced to Dr. Stanleys work about 10 years ago as I built my own pratice of being a CPA to millionaires. I can attest that his research and his conclusions on the wealthy are highly accurate. <br />Stanley does a great job of laying out statistical infortmation on American millionaires in easy to follow language. The book flows well through its first three quarters but ends a bit abruptly. Nevertheless it is required reading for anyone who wants to understand or join the wealthy.<br />One of the most interesting aspects of Stanleys book is the clarity he provides in illustrating that the reality of how most millionaires live is nowhere near as exotic as most non-millionaires presume. This is great book that belongs in your library!
B000001ESN|5.0|What can you say about an album that marks a band's turning the corner into newer, more fertile ground? Awesome!<br />I can't really amplify much what has been said already; suffice it to say that this simple, six-song album packs a wallop you find yourself never quite recovering from. Let's forget the popular &quot;Spirit of the Radio&quot; and &quot;Free Will&quot; for a moment, and consider that the whole album is filled with power and majesty. &quot;Jacob's Ladder&quot; is especially pleasing (you can almost feel the electricity coursing through it) and &quot;Natural Science&quot; goes from the grounded and organic to the fierce and cosmic and back again in only nine minutes.<br />If you were going to own only one Rush album, this would probably be it... not that you are, are you? ;)
B00008PW2E|5.0|Series One was just perfect, in every sense...<BR>But, please release the second season! I really don`t know what keeps you from releasing it. So please, get on with it!
B00018D44U|4.0|Hrm, not sure what to make of the new album.  Norah's voice is as sultry sandpaper-silk as ever, but I had expected a more adventurous effort.  After her first album, not writing but 3 songs, claiming it wasn't as upbeat as she had desired, I would have assumed this second album would be much more upbeat...which it isn't.  In fact, the Wurlitzer, Steinway and guitar all appear to be infused with benzodiazepines, and a White Russian a la carte - smooth, sit-back and fall asleep under the starry sky.  Not that that's bad.  <br />Dolly Parton on \\"Creepin' In.\\"  Err, strange.  I can envision her blonde curls and decolletage (where are accent marks when I need them?) boppin' along with this hokey pokey song.  But the song does incite some sing-along.<br />This album is not striking me as reaching, or expanding, her potential.  But it is clear Norah is working hard on improving.<br />The first and last tracks remain with me the most.  \\"Don't Miss You At All,\\" originally penned by Duke Ellington, is a stark beauty of a song.<br />This album is \\"Come Away With Me,\\" part 2.  It's the same Norah, but that is by no means a bad thing.  If you liked Norah before, you will continue to enjoy her.  Some songs got a bit more blues, a bit more bluegrass, but the songstress-ness of Norah reigns high and clear.
B0001AP12G|5.0|this one of the best album that going to come out in 2004 kanye you did it and to all that dont no him you need to
B0001AP12G|5.0|I can honestly say this is one of the best albums I have bought in the last few YEARS.  This album has something for everyone.  For the lover of the underground &quot;Rawkus sound&quot;; For the &quot;I listen to Hip-Hop for the lyrics&quot; lover; For the &quot;I just listen to the beat&quot; person; For the lover of the &quot;mainstream rap&quot; sound; For the lover of the &quot;eyes-half closed, puff-puff-pass&quot; sound; For the R&amp;B lover; For ANYONE who just wants to laugh and hear good music... THIS CD IS FOR YOU.  It's for all of us.<br />There are important messages in the CD about survival, self-esteem, education, religion, family, etc.  But the ENTIRE cd is laced with humor and jokes.  I'm talking side-splitting funny stuff.  And for some people (like me) it makes you feel better about not having completed the &quot;all American dream&quot; by going to college and getting an executive job.  It's one of those cds you can play all the way through and listen to without skipping songs.  Everyone can relate to AT LEAST one song on this CD.  Black, white, rich, poor, CEO, janitor, guys and girls (Kanye's Workout Plan), this one's for you.  LOL  <br />Honestly, if you're down to your last $15 and it's between putting gas in the car or getting this CD...put $3 in your tank to take you to the record store to use the other $12 to buy this!  :o)
B00005Q4CS|1.0|This movie is little more than two hours of one depressing act after another-- losers wasting their lives away on heroin; desperate old women popping pills and obsessing over appearing on game shows; ...  It's basically an account of four very stupid people who each find a way to completely ruin what semblance of a life they previously had.<br />That Jennifer Connelly received critical acclaim for her utterly depressing role in this film just goes to show you how hopelessly lost our film industry is today.  The only positive I can say about this film is that this had some pretty clever photographic sequences, and the musical score, while generally melancholy, was appealing.  Apart from that, this movie has no redeeming qualities whatsoever.  Glad I didn't pay money to see this movie, because I would have walked out and insisted on a refund.
0440237688|4.0|The Giver is a very interesting book.  I enjoyed reading about situations that are different than that of one's everyday life.  If you are into reading about things that may seem a little strange or if you like science fiction, this is the book for you.  Many things that happen in this novel are portrayed in a way that makes the reader believe what they read is true.  It is an excellent piece of literature for observing our world.
B0001CCXZW|5.0|The first season of Gilmore Girls is one of the best.  It is sharp and witty.  The writing is wonderful.  This was the season that was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Drama.  It should have won.  Apparently it was too funny to get Best Drama.  <br />This show is one of the best shows ever.  I am very glad that it is being released on DVD.  I can't wait to get it!
0962477060|2.0|Perhaps I just don't have the mental faculties for this book, but I am now looking for a very elementary music theory book so that one day Fret Logic might make sense. The author tells the reader not to go to part 2 until part 1 is mastered, which means I will probably never make it to part 2. I feel like I need a lot more knowlege for this book to make much sense.
B00000K0E5|4.0|After a six year hiatus brought on by legal matters (the late Cubby Broccoli was angry with MGM-UA for leasing the series to TBS), James Bond returned to the screen in the person of Pierce Brosnan in \\"Goldeneye,\\" a title taken from the name of Ian Fleming's estate.<br />The pre-title sequence is spectacular, but then it's downhill as our ears are subjected to the worst title song in 007 history, an unlistenable piece of drek co-written by Bono and screeched out by Tina Turner.<br />Thankfully, that's as low as things go for this 17th official entry in the series. Brosnan, though physically more in the Roger Moore mold (a tad fluffy, if you ask me), wisely seems to pattern his performance on the more rugged image of Sean Connery. Famke Janssen makes for an effective bad girl, and in another example of the series' total disregard for continuity, Joe Don Baker, the villain of 1987's \\"The Living Daylights,\\" returns as an ally.<br />After 33 years of mining box-office gold with the Bond formula, it would be silly to mess with the ingredients and \\"Goldeneye\\" neither shakes nor stirs the series to new heights. It's more of the same, but it's well-done and is a fine introduction to Brosnan's 007.
B00018D44U|5.0|It is tough to follow up with a crowd pleasing album after such great success.  The responses on this site prove it.  I applaud Nora on this release for staying true to her style, settling into her vocal range and producing a set of melodic songs that all flow together.  Don't expect anything earth shattering, or one stand out song; it isn't there.  This is just the perfect CD to entertain with in the afternoon under the warm summer sun and forget about anything unpleasant.
B00000K0EA|4.0|For the first time in years, a Bond film attempts something novel in terms of plot by making the villain a maniacal media mogul (am I being redundant?) patterned, it seems, on Rupert Murdoch. Very appropriate, if you ask me.<br />But \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" doesn't dwell on story, and with Michelle Yeoh on hand as a butt-kicking Chinese agent, it shouldn't. Not since Diana Rigg's Emma Peel on TV's \\"The Avengers\\" has a member of the fairer sex distinguished herself as an action star worthy of her male counterparts. Yeoh kicks considerable life into this 18th entry in the Bond saga, something Jonathan Pryce as the villain fails to do. Pryce is merely adequate, but is still more deserving of something better than smug-faced Teri Hatcher as his wife. But it doesn't matter. This is Yeoh's show all the way.<br />Brosnan eases comfortably into Bond's skin in his second-go-round as 007, but is once again saddled with an absolutely horrendous title song sung (if that's the word) by Sheryl Crow. Stick around through the closing credits, though, and your ears will be rewarded with a treat: K.D. Lang singing \\"Surrender,\\" a terrific ballad that utilizes the film's title and should have served as the theme.
B00005V0X5|5.0|awesome...this is the way to remastered, i order this cd from amazon.com. the sounds really amazing plus all the songs are mastrepiece . the booklet is good too, it got the lyrics, story behind the songs from dave &amp; david also msg from scott ian<BR>cool album cover too!
0684833395|4.0|Catch 22 is a novel set in final months of World War II. Yossarian, the protagonist, was a World War II Bombardier. In the novel, for thousands of people that didn't even know kept trying to kill him. This book I believe helps people to understand the meanings and feelings of war. For Yossarian lost several of his friends in war, bizzare accidnets, or even by fate, but he had to learn to handle it. This novel is not like every other novel, for it has no chronological order to it which gives it its uniqueness not only to the novel but also to the characters. For example, Yossarian goes crazy because he has gone through a lot but he gets through it. Major Major is a character to which he tells everyone they may visit him in his office, when he's not there. Some characters like Colonal Korn's just wants his picture in the paper and doesn't even care about his soldier or if they get bombed or anything. Heller makes the novel very interesting, but it is self-contradicting and has twisted reasoning for everything. He wants the reader to have to go back in the novel and remember certain events in order for it all to make sense. I also believe that because of all the little stories told about the other characters and the realationship Yossarian has with them, it ends up showing the reader a lot about Yossarian himself. For this novel is fun to read because it is field with numerous amounts of emotions from humor, to scary, to sadness and depressing moments allowing the reader to really get into the book. I enjoyed this book a lot, because I was able to keep reading it because I didn't want to put it down. I wanted to find out what kind of event was going to happen next. Catch 22 was none like any book I have read, and I recomend you read it.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|WOW, is all I could say as I saw Gavin DeGraw open for Barenaked Ladies last night in Philly.  This guy is a good songwriter and even better performer.  His charisma and energy are undeniably infectious.  On the way home from the BNL show, my wife and I talked as much about Gavin DeGraw's performance as we did about the headliner's.  Just bought the CD and am looking forward to getting it and to catching this band's next show in our area.  Thanks to BNL for introducing us to Gavin DeGraw.
B00003CXA3|1.0|This movie was incredibly boring. The whole movie is basically one long chase scene which is never finished. To jlind555: if Popeye Doyle is as you described him, &quot; a racist, selfish, insensitive,&quot; person, then why is he such an interesting character? Also you said that these traits helped him in his chase against the criminals. But didn't you see the ending? Doyle never catches the ringleader of the drug traffic. Those harsh characteristics of his obviously didn't help him very much. <BR>        After watching this movie, I was extremely surprised to find that it won several academy awards. This movie does have some very well done scenes, but the overall message of the film seems very pointless.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This film is terrible for so many reasons.  Let us explore a few:<br />1.  Rabidly Anti-Japanese.  Japanese culture is used as a punchline throughout the film.  Neither the characters nor the director show any interest in exploring Japan, in getting to know or understand it.  The film makes fun of the Japanese speaking poor English, yet the characters make no attempt to speak any Japanese.  This makes for a decidedly unfunny film, and one that is a bit offensive, to boot.<br />2.  The Characters are Losers.  Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansen play people who bemoan how alone they are in Japan.  Yet, they are victims of themselves--neither has the feintest interest in correcting their problems or making the best of their situation (i.e. exploring Tokyo).  All they do is sit in the same bar and drink for two hours.  This makes for a boring film.<br />3.  Immaturity of the Performances.  Scarlet Johansen is too young to play this role; she comes off far more like an high-schooler than a graduate of Yale with a degree in philosophy.  And four years of higher education have apparently dulled any interest she has in a new culture or exotic country.  <BR>    As for Bill Murray, he plays serious by being hang-dog and acting like a jerk.  Would anyone pay his character $2 million to sell whiskey?  Bill Murray may be getting critical acclaim these days, but it is a sad story when his last watchable movies were Groundhog Day and Ghostbusters 2!<br />4.  Cheap Plot.  The nature of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansen's attraction is never fully adressed (plus, there is not an ounce of chemistry between the two).  At first, Bill Murray's interest seems fatherly, but at the end, the director panders to mediocrity and reveals that it is the typical hollywood fare: older man's lust for much younger woman.  One would have expected better from a young, female director.<br />The film has many other faults, but space dictates we focus only on these four for now.  Avoid this film, and avoidpeople who enjoy this film.
0804106304|4.0|I really love this book! Amy Tan's writing brings such life to all her characters. The relationships betweent these mothers and daughters are so realistic. The relationships are not perfect by any means, but they are meaningful and touching. This book makes the reader reevaluate their own relationships with all of their family, especially their mothers. Also touching is Jing-mei \\"June\\" Woo's (one of the daughters) description of her mother's group of friends, \\"The Joy Luck Club\\". She speaks of them with such love and envy that it made me wish I had a core group of friends like them. This book is wonderful and I highly recommend it!!
0385504209|1.0|I've read so of the reviews and I recently read one someone saying all Catholics are evil.  Well I'm sorry to say but Dan Brown's books aren't 'All True', but In order to know that you'll have to have had so historical backround.  Dan Brown used people's ignorace of history to write a book that would cause Catholics to break away and people to hate Catholics for things they never did.  The book is so obviously Anti-Catholic it's laughable.<br />A few examples of his \\"impeccable\\" research:<br /> He claims that the motions of the planet Venus trace a pentacle (the so-called Ishtar pentagram) symbolizing the goddess. But it isn't a perfect figure and has nothing to do with the length of the Olympiad. The ancient Olympic games were celebrated in honor of Zeus Olympias, not Aphrodite, and occurred every four years.<br />Brown's contention that the five linked rings of the modern Olympic Games are a secret tribute to the goddess is also wrong - each set of games was supposed to add a ring to the design but the organizers stopped at five. And his efforts to read goddess propaganda into art, literature, and even Disney cartoons are simply ridiculous.<br />No datum is too dubious for inclusion, and reality falls quickly by the wayside. For instance, the Opus Dei bishop encourages his albino assassin by telling him that Noah was also an albino (a notion drawn from the non-canonical 1 Enoch 106:2). Yet albinism somehow fails to interfere with the man's eyesight as it physiologically would.<br />-from  ... ^^^.<br />~Little Flower~

0060194995|5.0|I'm in 8th grade right now, in the advanced English class. We're reading this book for class. I was entranced quickly, and finished the book before the 'class' got to part 2, like many of my friends on the same level. This book is absolutely astounding: It has everything: beautiful writing,  morality, humor, and the recognition of discrimination: Both against black people and against people with mental disabilities (like my sister). It shows the racist ways that were law in this age, and speaks against them. I loved reading it: One of the things I love about the 9X class is that we anilize the text: We see hints and foreshadowing, we notice small details. The two sides of good and evil are very easily defined, which is part of the beauty of the book. It shows love among children and of adults. It clearly puts good and bad face to face. Last, but not least, it shows that part of the niave fool, the mockingbird. Definitly one of the world classics, it will stand within it's own time, and I'm sure it won't be forgotten. Anyone who is intersted in great literature must read this.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Okay, let's get this out of the way first.  Farscape is the best Sci-Fi show ever...period.  Firefly, if it actually wanted to BE a Sci-Fi show, would probably have surpassed Farscape if it was given enough time.<br />What makes this show (Firefly) so fantastic, is that it does not hit the viewer over the head by saying constantly, &quot;Hey, this is a science fiction show, so we'll do a lot of weird, other-worldly stuff that's never been done before.&quot;  Instead, Whedon took painfully careful steps towards making this show an emotionally truthful telling of the human race's possible future.<br />The future isn't all &quot;shiny,&quot; but rather just a more technologically advanced form of functional gadgets.  Think about it, do our guns today look any more futuristic -- at the core -- as they did in the 1800's?  Not really.<br />On top of the realism, the show boosts some truly genius comedic moments, an incredible juggling act of over NINE characters (none of which ever fall by the wasteside as dialog fillers, but actually get their fair share of character development; which is even more incredible when you consider the fact that this show was only on the air for 11 episodes), and some truly astonishing CGI work that perfectly blends futuristic items (such as a personal space ship) with real world beings (such as the same personal space ship flying over the heads of galloping horses).<br />This is genre television perfection, and a little bit more time to develop would have yielded an example of beyond perfection.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|This film is undoubtedly one of my favourite films of all time. Having viewed this film countless times, I thought it necessary to make a comment given the negative opinions expressed by some people. <br />What with the brilliant acting, witty and clever dialogue, intriguing plot and magnificant musical score it's hard to fathom how someone could dislike this film. At the heart of the film's brilliance is its open-ended plot. Unlike Memento and 12 Monkeys (and Mulholland Drive to a degree), the viewer is required to form his own conclusions as to the ultimate meaning the film imparts. It requires the viewer to think; it is indie at its absolute best.<br />It is not a mainstream film in any sense of the word. And it is, as others have said, a film that you will either love or hate. If you generally like films that have a discernable plot and comprehensible conclusion it is likely that you will dislike this film.<br />But with an open mind, multiple viewings and patience (of which some people obviously lack), you too shall fall in love with this film. It is, quite simply, brilliant.
B00005ATQF|5.0|I watched this for my first time a couple days ago and it is a really good movie. I didn't find any problems with the DVD. The whole movie was good other tan the scenes where the beat on Pyle and Pyle comits suicide and also kills the drill instructor.
B00005JM20|2.0|Yep, yours truly is a big Mr. Bean fan, but I couldn't believe how bad this movie was.  The plot is pretty dumb, but there are plenty of dumb-plot movies that are well made.  This one is not one of them.  From the very beginning you'll find yourself disappointed by the acting and the editing.  This is one of the films where things just don't flow.  There are very few truly funny moments.  Even the bathroom scene where JE dances to the camera-in-the-mirror feels trite and stupid, not funny.  Maybe as a big Mr. Bean fan I was expecting something half decent, and as a huge James Bond fan I was expecting a comedy that properly insults the real 007 series.  On both counts, I was let down tremendously.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have not watched TV regularly since the 1980's - there just wasn't enough there to make it worth my time.  My brother gave me this DVD set for Christmas and said &quot;You must see this&quot;.  One slow night I watched the first show and was hooked.  Two big pluses for me:  strong women in non-stereotypical roles (second-in-command and engineer) and very witty dialog.  One warning - this is an adult show, probably a PG-13 at least, for adult situation and some violence.
B000005IZ8|5.0|I frankly admit that I dont know anything about 20th Century serious composers-I mainly listen to jazz-but this album is astonishing. I have to admit that some of Glass' other works,like &quot;The Photographer,&quot; don't excite me very much. But the music on this CD is wonderful.On the strength of this album and the other soundtracks for this trilogy I've been carefully buying other Glass CDs. If some customer stumbles on to this album and is intimidated or turned off by Glass' reputation as a &quot;serious&quot; composer,let me assure them that this is an album that almost anyone can sit down and listen to and enjoy. Don't let his reputation as a &quot;classical&quot; composer who works with orchestras prevent you from grabbing this incredible CD. You don't have to be a highbrow to listen to this
B000006OAM|4.0|I heard KIND &amp; GENEROUS countless times back in June 1998. I was moving to Florida from New Jersey and the radio was on most of the trip in the vehicle I was driving. I heard it going through Delaware,North Carolina and South Carolina. This album was recently released back then. OPHELIA is available in both a standard fiberglass case(what most compact discs are packaged in) and a light cardboard gatefold case. BREAK YOUR HEART is the only other major hit from this album. I like LIFE IS SWEET(the music of the song was beautifully written). FROZEN CHARLOTTE sounds cool also. I don't care much for the string quartet that plays following the conclusion of WHEN THEY RING THE GOLDEN BELLS. The quartet played just as long as WTRTGB itself. Although it's uncredited on the back cover of the CD,it's(the quartet's performance) entitled OPHELIA(reprise). The title track opens this album. The reprise of OPHELIA is listed on the back of the CD booklet(my copy is in the standard fiberglass case). Every song on this album,like its predecessor TIGERLILY,was written,both words and music,by Natalie. Her second solo album is packed with photos of Natalie in various wardrobes. She also appears on the label on the CD. Most people who own this album also own TIGERLILY and all or some of Natalie's albums with her former band,10,000 Maniacs.
0385510438|4.0|John Grisham's The Last Juror is a very good read, but it is not a mystery.  It's the story of a college dropout, who finds acceptance after becoming a newspaper publisher.  Grisham sets the story in Clanton, Mississippi.  The setting of his first novel, A Time To Kill.  Several of the characters from that book are back in this one.  The unusual characters are what makes the book so enjoyable.
B0001906O0|3.0|So let's get this out of the way right away. In my personal opinion pretty much everything starting with \\"Boys Don't Cry\\" and ending with \\"Disintegration\\" is the only Cure stuff worth even considering. Let's face it, the albums went down hill fast. \\"Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me\\" shows the song writing ability of a drunken retard, \\"Blood Flowers\\" was a close-but-no-cigar attempt at getting back into the mood of \\"Pornography\\" and \\"Disintegration\\", and \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" is just awful. Okay, I'll give you \\"Wish\\", \\"Wish\\" is the only great album The Cure have made since 89'. Which leads me, instantly, to tell you that Discs 3 and 4 on this collection are worthless. <br />Disc Four is variant/remixed versions of stuff on \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" and \\"BloodFlowers\\", did we really need a remix of \\"Out Of This World\\" arguably the only good song on Bloodflowers? I mean, come on, it's a somber acoustic guitar song, and now it has fat funky booty beats and microwave malfunction sounds? The only good song on Disc Four is \\"This is a Lie\\" the only tolerable song on Wild Mood Swings, and the mix is basically just all string instruments, it's pretty, i'll say it.<br />Disc Three starts off with B-sides from \\"Wish\\", which is an album I like to begin with, and the B-sides are obviously related to the feeling of that album, so those were songs I liked. However, disc three trails off into a bunch of horrible songs that The Cure had made for various sound tracks. Oh and just in case you weren't enjoying yourself enough as it is, there are three versions of The Cure covering \\"Purple Haze\\" mixed in with \\"Wild Mood Swings\\" B-sides, a true excersize in torture. The only redeeming things on this disc are the \\"Wish\\" b-sides, and the song \\"Burn\\" which The Cure did for the movie \\"The Crow\\", I consider this to be their best song ever (hence the reason robert smith lumped it in on the crap disc in the box set).<br />Disc Two starts off bad with \\"Kiss Me, Kiss Me, Kiss Me\\" B-sides, get's better with the Disintegration b-sides, but then goes back to bad when I have to listen to three intolerable covers of The Doors song \\"Hello I Love You\\". God kill me now, please.<br />Disc One is the best disc in the box. It includes B-sides from \\"Boys Don't Cry\\", \\"Seventeen Seconds\\", \\"Faith\\", some variant stuff from \\"Japanese Whispers\\", and some select B-sides from \\"Head on the Door\\"-era Cure. I really like this disc, and wish I could say all the others were as good. This disc is the reason I passed the box-set off with three stars.<br />Here's the big problem I had with the box. NO PORNOGRAPHY B-SIDES!!! Pornography is my favorite album from The Cure, and I was hoping and praying that this box-set would have some rare or variant stuff that hadn't been released that would be on here for me to dance like a giddy school girl in the joy of it's presence, but no. And I think there could have been more Disintegration stuff, I've got singles that have some B-sides from Disintegration that weren't on the box. Anyway, I was thoroughly disappointed by this Box Set, it's been a while since I've been able to say I bought anything new from The Cure that was awesome, and unfortunately I have to keep waiting. One upside to the Box Set you ask? The book that it comes in is cool.<br />Key Songs: Leave me alone I don't want to talk about it...
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is the BEST hip hop cd's I've bought in a really long time. Everything about it was good, from the lyrics, to the beat to the hook. When I listen to it, I feel good. What I love most is how it's not a glorify drug dealing and guns CD. And it's also not &quot;bling and cars&quot; It's just rhyming about life and the stuff it puts you through.
B00000IL31|5.0|Ok ok. So you wanna get the edited version of Undertow.<BR>The music is not edited, the artwork is though.<BR>Instead of the ribcage and the nude artwork in the book <BR>what you get is the barcode and in certain versions a message from tool. <BR>So just get the original. The cd is great and is the best tool cd.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|For a first season, Firefly season 1 is unsurpassed in television history (perhaps unparralleled as far back as MASH season 1).  It was well written, superbly acted and wonderfully filmed.  There was none of the character awkwardness that virtually all first year shows must struggle through (go back and see season one of STNG and see for yourself).  <br />It was interesting, entertaining, visually stunning and was the paragon of everything a television program could and should be.  If you are at all intrigued by what you have seen or heard about this show then I cannot recommend the dvd set enough.  <br />Besides, it will be a good primer for the movie  ;)
8590379817|5.0|Lua is a free scripting language with an interesting development history. It is a language that is gaining wider acceptance thanks to small size, readable syntax, expressive power, efficiency, ANSI C portability and easy two-way integration with C and C++. It is also useful as a data-description language that can be tailored to one's needs.<br />Written by the chief architect of the language, this book is aimed at programmers whishing to approach or to better understand Lua and the (often unsuspected) capabilities offered by a fully dynamic language.<br />Despite its deceptively small size (260 pages) and a plain, readable style with an eye-resting typesetting, &quot;Programming in Lua&quot; packs an impressive amount of information peppered with small, clear code examples to help digesting it; it reminds me of my favorite programming book: the K&amp;R (Kernighan and Ritchie's &quot;The C programming language&quot;). It is a multi-level book that always gives something new at every reading.<br />Rather than offer a catalogue of functions (left to the downloadable reference manual), the book's four sections introduce capabilities, concepts and interesting techniques that may surprise programmers used to static languages.<br />The first section is devoted to the language itself, including not-so-common subjects like dynamic typing, multiple results, first-class functions, closures, iterators and coroutines. The following section shows how to build all sorts of data structures, from simple arrays and lists to packages and objects, using Lua's &quot;tables&quot; and the powerful idea of &quot;metatables&quot; that makes the language easily customizable. <BR>The third section introduces the standard libraries (they are actually optional, e.g. in microcontroller applications) with special emphasis on the simple but versatile pattern matching capabilities.<br />The fourth and last section is different: aimed at system programmers, it explains in detail how to interface Luaand C, both to add new functions to Lua and to use Lua inside a C program (possibly called from programs written in other languages).<br />&quot;Programming in Lua&quot; covers version 5.0 of the language, which is now mature and stable. I am using Lua both as a general-purpose 'light' language for system tasks or small programs, and as an embedded language inside C++ applications: the combined power of the two languages is impressive. I liked this book a lot, I learned much from it and I've done it the honor of a place besides my well-thumbed K&amp;R.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This short-lived series was doomed from the start by the network's refusal to air the pilot, their insistence on showing the episodes out of sequence and continually switching the time-slot. Well, apparently they were so busy trying to foil it that they didn't get around to watching it--it is by far the finest show to have ever graced the small screen.<br />An amazing mixture of the western and sci-fi genres, this show takes place aboard a scavenger vessel 500 years into the future. No wacky aliens or starship gun battles in this show, instead it utilizes the purest elements of speculative fiction to vividly paint a realistic portrait of what our future might hold. Space is the high seas, the planets are the rugged frontier and the super-villian is an antiseptic all-powerful corporate-government conglomeration. <br />As with Joss Whedon's other shows, \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and \\"Angel\\" the dialogue is extraordinarily funny, sophisticated and silly all at the same time, the acting is superb and the drama weaves around the constructed family relations of the ensemble of characters. One need not be a fan of the aforementioned shows to love this one, in fact it is quite different. Nor does one need to be a fan of sci-fi but those who enjoy LeGuin, Dick, Heinlein, Sterling and Stephenson will be thrilled. Have a thing for westerns? This show is for you. You don't like westerns? You will after this!
B00005JM02|4.0|This movie is typical Disney fare.  It's funny, heart-warming, thought-provoking and the ending (where Marlin finds Nemo) is pretty much guaranteed to bring a tear to your eye.<br />It really is a *good* movie, and I'd recommend it if you just want to watch a funny movie and enjoy it.  <br />However, if you want an accurate movie, then this isn't the one for you.  Oh, it's accurate in the way the fish movie and such.  But this movie is set on the Great Barrier Reef off of the east coast of Australia.<br />So, why are all the characters bar two voiced by Americans?<br />And why are the ones who are voiced by Australians (Bill Hunter as the Dentist and Barry Humphries as Bruce the Great White Shark) the comic relief?<br />To me, this stinks of the American policy of knocking my country and making us out to be nothing more than a lot of yahoos and idiots.  If I was going to write and film a movie about a Texas rancher, I certainly wouldn't have Australian actors playing the major parts.<br />But, I suppose, Disney being the wealthy and powerful company it is, they have no need for accuracy of that kind in their movies.  After all, who cares as long as it makes money?
B0000CDLA7|4.0|What a album! Heavy and loud. Not what anyone would expect from Dream Theater. Some reviews didn't like the heaviness of the album, but to me thats a welcome change. It's more in your face type music. This album seems even angry at some points, which is not somewhere Dream Theater has headed too much on previous albums. However, The real problem to me, is the long instrumentals that don't even seem to belong in the songs. Also, they could cut down the tracks length some, and make more songs instead. I mean it's ok to do one album &quot;Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence&quot; that way, but we need some songs under 7 minutes. 1. As I Am - A song that is a statement about how the band feels about its critics.  . . . 90% 2. This Dying Soul - Basically Part 2 of the Glass Prison. Infact the music is a updated version on the parts of that song in places. It's actually a interesting track if it had not been for the long instrumental.   . . . 85% 3. Endless Sacrifice - Slow softer verses and fast heavy Chorus. The song is decent, but a bit hard to enjoy with the long Instrumental again.  . . . 85% 4. Honor Thy Father - Great song on the other hand. Interesting subject a family fights. It's a very angry song, which is something Dream Theater never have done before, or atleast til this album.  . . . 95% 5. Vacant - A very simple short 3 minute track thats like &quot;Disappear&quot;. It's plain didn't work however this time.  . . . 80% 6. Stream Of Consciousness - A 11 minute long instrumental track that leads off the previous track. It is OK, but could have shorted it to lets say 5 minutes or something? .  . . 75% 7. In The Name Of God - Very interesting subject here. Some very good points made here. The music is so ugly and grinder, its so different from what Dream theater has done before, but it rules! . . .95% If you like this album, I would also suggest: Dream Theater - Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence. Funny this album is as far as I see a first, and nothing is really likethis album. Thats why I only have one album to suggest.
0385504209|5.0|I have read some of the reviews and felt compelled to write my own.  First, if you notice, all of the bad reviews are from readers who are obviously Mid-Western Catholics or Bible-belt people who are taking the book too personally.  First of all, the book is FICTION!  Of course it's not going to be wholly accurate!!  These religious zealots that are so in an uproar about this need to loosen up.  Better yet, instead of burying Dan Brown's literature, why don't you go pray instead?  Literature is meant for enjoyment and to be thought provoking - Dan Brown had done an exceptional job of this.  I recommend this book.
B00018D44U|5.0|The first album had more great songs, but this one has more good songs. If you liked the first one, odds are you'll like this one just as much.<br />Funny to see negative reviews from people who say 'go listen to Spears or Minogue instead'. Well, duh. If you like music for 13 year old girls, you're not going to appreciate Norah Jones.
6305074593|4.0|Having read about 60 of the reviews for this film, I can't believe no-one has offered the opinion that this film is basically a religious allegory - a sinner, whose disdain for other people shows in his attitude to his ex-wife, and brother - has taken away from him all that he possesses (or is possessed by). He is restored, redeemed if you will, by the mysterious operations of CRS. It seems fairly obvious.<BR>Looked at like this, the plot and the ending (which seem to have outraged so many of the reviewers) don't call so much for a suspension of disbelief as a willingness to participate in the symbolic coherence of the allegory. I'm not a Christian, but I can admire the courage of a film that dares to push the narrative so far, and in such a direction. <BR>Douglas is excellent as the central character hardly trying at all not to repeat the &quot;fall&quot; of his father (until CRS comes along), while Penn, to his enormous credit, makes a credible brother. Unger I like to think of as the presiding angel of the film, one who appears as a nuisance to Douglas, but leads him eventually through the shadows - and she does very well too.<BR>One other thing - the score, by Howard Shore, is terrifically simple, plangent and tense by turns; the film would not please so much without it.
B0000A1RJI|5.0|I walked out of the  movie theater humming the music. <BR>I promptly went out and bought the cd. The music is varied, emotional, and energizing, perfect for dueling with dastardly physics homework, reading,or just plain piratical listening fun. Warning, put your car on cruise control while listening to it, you'll want to jump up and start fighting with cursed pirates....
B000002NIW|5.0|In my opinion I think this is the most incredible, unique album and never gets boring.  When I first listened to it I thought it was ok but after listening to it afew more times I've come to realise just how amazing this album is.  Its got got everything from melodic singing to screams to rapping.  The songs are so emotional and Chinos vocals are different to any other bands and are so atmouspheric.  Another thing I love about this album are the lyrics.  Chino doesnt scream about death and pain throughout the whole thing, but instead he uses clever metaphors and allows you to think about the meanings of the lyrics instead of the meanings being spelt out to us like Korn and Slipknot have a tendency of doing.  I have been listening to this album everyday for about a year and the songs havent got old once.  If you like metal in any way i recomend buying this and for all you linkin park fans you can see were they get their inspiration from.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm not a big TV watcher but after watching just one episode I loved Firefly, was crushed when it was cancelled, and am delighted with the DVD series. The characters are so well drawn, interesting funny and lovable, and the situations are riviting.
B00004Z459|2.0|Admittedly linkin park write catchy tunes which stick in your head for days on end even though you dont like the song but for me this album is way too polished.  The vocals live have alot of emotion live bit on the cd it loses its rawness and becomes weak.  Another thing I dislike about this album is the fact the lyrics seem to be the same in every song.  The songs all seem to have the same theme about pain and hurt but never get into to much gritty detail like real problems in the world because then the radios wont like that and there songs wont reach the top 10 spot. I think the album is good for kids just getting into music but real music fans will see straight through the polished production and meaningless songs.
6305014140|4.0|Ninja Scroll...Hmmm...It's hard to review this one.<BR>First,let's deal with the violence and sex to get that outta the way.Yes.this is an incredibly violent movie,and lots of needless nudity/rape/sex.It's a shame,really,it almost ruined the movie for me,and left me with a baaaad taste in my mouth.Okay.Now I will speak as if you are aware of what I just said,which is a valid assumption.<BR>Now.to get something else out of the way,everyone who badmouths this movie says it's stereotypical.Well,at this movie's age,maybe it's a sound assumption that this movie started some of those stereotypes?Therefore that statement has been proven INVALID.Wahaha.Perhaps a better argument is that the story is showing its age,which I can attest to.<BR>The characters are very memorable,espeially Dakuan,the crazy old man with a lazy eye.He rocks.But,I'm afraid the story feels rushed at the end,with the main 'bad guys' dying left and right before they even really put up a fight.The Japanese voice acting is superb,and I think Wendy Lee does Kagero's dub voice.She isn't nearly as good ad the original,but she passes,unlike Jubei's cocky American voice.uggggghhhhhhhh...The animation is AWESOME.(for its time)But,this is a movie we're talking about.<BR>Bleh..I gotta go,so I'll wrap it up.<BR>it's pretty good.Buy it if you can stomach the senseless sexual content.By the way,if you're gonna bash it,PLEAAAASE stop calling it 'just another samurai anime'.There is a VAST difference between ninja and samurai.
B00008RV1M|5.0|SIMPLY PUT, THIS IS THE GREATEST FILM OF THE PAST DECADE IF NOT LONGER.
B00008S2VH|3.0|You have to listen to the album more than once.  With all of the techie blips and vocal tricks, it can get a bit distracting.  American Life (the song) was too much like Die Another Day and with the video and the war happening, it got buried at radio.  It deserved better.  Hollywood was not a strong choice for the second single.  The best songs are Nothing Fails (great ballad - but skip the remix version on her EP), Nobody Knows Me, Mother &amp; Father, and Love Profusion (all great dance songs).  Of course, Die Another Day is great too, but it's the soundtrack version which goes on a bit longer than the single version.
B0000041BX|5.0|One of my favourite discs!<BR>The Italian Quartet gives a wonderful reading of Schubert,<BR>Dramatic Flowing Music!<BR>The last Two Quartets: No. 14 &quot;Death and the Maiden&quot; and No. 15<BR>Are Pure works of art!<BR>But, actually, in the case of Schubert, it is hard to label <BR>some works over others...<BR>Most of his Music is Plain Pure Masterpieces!
B000002LND|5.0|Okay, first off, yes I know this collection is not complete and excludes some of Madonna's hits.  Big deal!  It's a fine compilation and I for one am glad that all of these versions are new!  I already have her other albums and would have felt ripped off if she just put the album versions on this disk.  <br />The highlights for me are Holiday (yes, I prefer the album version not included here), Vogue (30 seconds longer than the album version), Like A Prayer (an edit of the dance remix version), Express Yourself (edit of the dance remix), Rescue Me (a new song with some fierce vocals), and Into The Groove (edit of the U Can Dance Shep Pettibone version).  <br />Personally, I would have replaced the 2 ballads with Dress You Up and Causing A Commotion.  I'm glad Who's That Girl isn't on the disk; although it hit #1, it is a lame song.
847888579X|5.0|Coraline<BR>By: Neil Gaiman<BR>Reviewed by: J. Song<BR>P.1 <br />In this book, Coraline first moves into a new home. She lives with weird people. When she checked out her new home, she found a door that had a brick wall behind it. The two elder women downstairs gave Coraline a rock with a hole in it for good luck because her tea leaves said that danger would come soon. Coraline goes through the door with the brick wall behind it, and she finds her Other Mother, and her Other Father. They have buttons for eyes. They say that if Coraline lived with them than her real parents they'll love her. She disagrees, and goes back to the real world. Her parents are gone for a few days, and Coraline expects that the other mother took them. She goes back in to find them. She meets three other children, their souls trapped in the Other Mother's world. Coraline has to help them find their souls. The other mother and Coraline bet each other that Coraline can find all the souls and her parents. She bets her eternity with the other mother, and the other mother bets her good right hand.  The search begins. Coraline successfully finds all the people, with the help of a black cat. She even managed to kill the Other Mother. When they get out, the Other Mother's right hand was looking for the black key that can open the door. She successfully traps it in the almost bottomless well in the backyard with the black key. She had freed the souls, and saved her parents.<br />I like this book. It was scary and thrilling at the same time. In the book it quotes, \\"I'm going back for them because they are my parents.\\" That shows that Coraline was brave to go back to the Other Mother's world. She did that because she knew that even though she was scared, she had to go save her parents. That was brave. She is a very brave person. The black cat seemed to ask why she's going in, and Coraline told him the story that told of her father's bravery when she was young. He had stayed at the bottom of the hill when the wasps attacked them. He gave Coraline a chance to run away, and when he ran away he accidentally dropped his glasses. He went back to get them knowing that the wasps were still there. <br />\\"You'll be fine, said Coraline.¡±Everything's going to be fine.\\" These quotes in the book show that even though she's scared, she has her heart to guide and protect her. I liked this part because it was the part that the black cat had caught the mouse to help Coraline when she was in need the most. The cat didn't like catching rats, but Coraline needed help, so he helped her. This part shows friendship and caring for each other. The black cat really liked her, but he pretended that he didn't care about her at all. He likes to torture rats, but Coraline says that it's too mean. <br />My favorite part in this book was when she defeated the Other Mother. She threw the cat at her. The cat got scared, and it started scratching the Other Mother. Black, goopy things started to pour out of the Other Mother. At that part, Coraline quickly grabbed the snow globe, which the parents were captured in. At this part, Coraline runs out the door, since she had convinced the Other Mother that her parents were in there, and closed the door. She quickly locked it with the key. This part was breath taking.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This cd is amazing. @ first i was kind of skeptical since I felt that only jay-z and cam'ron had talent in the rocafella squad. Man I was wrong. I figured hip hop was basically over with jay-z and dmx retiring in 2003, and eminem resoritng to producing mostly I feared that rap would be overtaken by mainstream chingy's and no talent rapper's such as ying yang (catchy beats but worst rappers by far!) This cd made me optimistic about the future of hip hop. This is the all eyez on me, illmatic, reasonable doubt, ready to die, and blueprint of our time. Get this cd before your left out of the humor on the cd and great tracks. Will be the number 1 cd of the year until eminem's new album drops.
0440234743|5.0|I loved this book it kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. If you haven't read it you should!!!
0812550706|1.0|I know I'm in the extreme minority on this one, but I have to say that I just hated almost everything about this book. <br />Ender is the elite of the elite -- he is a 6-year old kid who possesses the most advanced physical and mental abilities of anyone that the universe has ever seen.  Let me try and sum up some of his most incredible accomplishments: he figures out that he can impersonate someone else's log in name by adding a space after it, he figures out that any direction can be considered up in zero gravity, and he develops winning laser tag strategies like not assembling your troops into rigid formations.  I mean, sure that's all great for a six-year old, but we're talking about the guy who we're counting on to save the universe here. <br />The plot itself is very thin.  It's good versus evil in a video game battle.  I'm sure this was all a whole lot more exciting when it was written in 1977, before the internet and when video games were in their infancy.  But that is no excuse for the way over-simplified story line, the ethnically-stereotyped characters, and the painfully crude dialogue.  It reads like it was written by someone who hasn't been around kids for 30 years trying to remember how kids talk.<br />Don't waste your time with this one.
B00005Y6YB|5.0|I had never seen &quot;Lonesome Dove.&quot;  I missed it the first time it was on TV, and each time since. I just purchased this DVD, (which by the way is of excellent quality) and the family sat down four nights in succession to watch the whole epic. We were all stunned. If Oscars were given for television, Robert Duvall would have gotten the Oscar for his work here.  He was just the best. Tommy Lee and Danny Glover and Diane Lane were all excellent - as was the entire cast...I mean really - Anjelica Houston was wonderful.  The casting was one of a kind, and I am going to skip the &quot;sequels and prequels&quot; because they could never match the story I became entranced with enough to recommend to everyone I know.  The extras are also interesting, especially the conversation with Larry McMurtry.  I had never read anything by him, and now I can't wait to start reading just a few of his books to sample this wonderful storyteller in the print form.<br />I would not recommend &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; for young children or the squeamish, as there are many extremely sudden incidences of violence and death, very sad in context and probably very much in tune with the realities of the setting.  Certainly the epic doesn't glamorize the time and place, but &quot;Lonesome Dove&quot; is about character, and we find all too little of that around us in our time.
B000063DIR|3.0|This is a classic album that should have been left alone. Ozzy has admitted numerous times that he knows nothing of the music business, so who do we blame for this? His manager Sharon. She replaced Bob Daisley's bass playing with Robert Trujillo's and Lee Kerslakes' drumming with Mike Bordin. I'm sorry but I see no point in this and it's a rip-off to the fans. Sharon probably didn't want to pay these two any royalties or something. But what if she had replaced Randy Rhodes with Zakk Wylde? THAT would have caused a riot at any OzzFest. Sharon knew if she did that she'd have hell to pay, not only from Randy's mom, but every longtime Ozzy fan.<br />I'll admit the album itself sounds great, but that's no excuse. I can hear differences in the bass and drums when I compare it to my old vinyl copy, but for the most part the playing is identical. Shame on you Sharon, not only for tampering with classic albums, but for now making his Ozzness a walking, talking joke on MTV.
B00006879E|5.0|I saw Maroon 5 open a Matchbox 20 Concert last spring when Harder to Breathe first started to get major air play.  I really liked that song, but was surprised to like all the music they played during their set.  When This Love was released, I decided that I needed to buy their CD.  That was a great decision, because this CD is one of those rare jewels that you can listen to all the way through!  It is like nothing else out there right now.  They songs all have a different play on rhythm, and Adam Levine's voice is incredible.  This is just good music.
B0000CAQ27|1.0|this just goes to show that just because you have a catchy name like PINK you can get a recording contract even if you cant sing. Every time ive ever seen her on tv singing she was total crap with one of the weakest voices i ever heard. I cant believe people fall for this crap.
B0001IN0DA|5.0|This WRESTLEMANIA is going to be one that shouldn't be forgotten<BR>because the  ever dominant Undertaker is coming back and in my opinion the matches at WRESTLEMANIA XX would probably be <BR>Triple H VS Chris Benoit VS Shawn Micheals<BR>Eddie Guerrero VS Kurt Angle<BR>Big Show VS John Cena<BR>Goldberg VS Brock Lesnar<BR>Batista and Randy Orton VS Mick Foley and the Rock<BR>Chris Jericho VS Christan<BR>Scotty 2 hotty and Rikishi VS The Basham Brothers<BR>Chavo VS Rey Mysterio <BR>Undertaker(old school) VS Kane<BR>and speacial appearences<BR>so this is why I think March 14th 2004 will be a night to rember
B00007E8V4|5.0|i love this album!!! because u all like it, i will do a song-by- song review :-) <br />Chic n Stu- 8/10 This song is really funny! I like the part where Serj is like 'Pepporonni, onion, peppers, mushrooms, olives, chive.' Very nice.<br />Innerision- 7/10 This is a very good song, will possibly be the next single. Has a very strong meaning.<br />Bubbles- 5/10 I don't like this one much, highly forgettable<br />Boom!- 9/10 I love Serj's trance-like voice in this one.  It is about how too much American money is spent on explosives. Sad but true.<br />Nuguns- 6/10 I love the intro.  The rest of the song...is worth a 4.<br />A.D.D.- 9/10 I love this song!!!! it has a very true meaning. It stands for American Dream Denial.  It is somewhat sad.<br />Mr. Jack- 10000000000/10 THIS SONG IS SO COOL! This is my favorite SOAD song of all time. I like the riff that goes throughout the whole song but gradually gets faster. It is a complaint against police. Too much swearing at the end.<br />I-E-A-I-A-I-O- 7/10- Funny song with very fast-paced singing.  There is one line about Jimmy Carter and fighter pilots.  I bet Serj was high when he wrote this.<br />36- 3/10 Filler.  Has a weird nursery rhyme feel to it...<br />Pictures- 2/10 This is the only problem here. I really dont like this, Serj put no thought into it when it was wrote! At least the rest are better than this.<br />Highway Song- 7/10 Blends into Pictures really well. I thought it was still pictures the first time i heard it! other than that, no comment.<br />F*ck The System- 8/10 Another anti-war song. Full of swears, very unpredictable.<br />Ego Brain- 10/10 Very well put together.  This is the kind of System i like. I love the acoustic part at the beginning.<br />Thetawaves- 7/10 No comment.<br />Roulette- 1/10 A different side of SOAD, not one i like. Sorry, Serj!<br />Streamline- 8/10 A very strong closer about Serj's girlfriend leaving him.<br />Overall, this album is AWESOME!!!!!
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Of all the albums I've bought in recent times, none have received as much play and given me as much enjoyment as this one!  There are so many incredible tracks with great lyrics, production, music, vocals, etc.  The quality of the music, as far as pop music goes, is first class!  I have yet to hear a better pop album than this one.  Standout tracks include Me Against the Music,  Breathe on Me,  Toxic, Touch of My Hand, &amp; Everytime.  Anyone who knocks this album is either deaf or simply a pathetic hater because it's nothing short of fantastic!  Don't listen to the negativity and pick up this album immediately because it's the best of its genre!!
B000069CWE|5.0|Alright, if you don't like remixes and stuff like that, skip this and get LP's otha albums. I think the 3 message machine thangs were really stupid ideas, bu 1STP KLOSR and KRWLING make up for it.I didn't like Motion Man (Who is he?) messing up ENTH E ND (yo yo yo). H! VLTG is a horrific song. I gave it 5/5 cuz i love linkin park and can't truely hate any ov their songs.<BR>If u like the alternative style, skip this album<BR>(I think Linkin Park shouldn't go under any genre, Alternative will cover the nu-metal, hip-hop, hard rock, etc.)
B0000DD7LB|5.0|I must say I was quite impressed with this album.  I have heard all of Britney's cd's from the beginning of her career to this present day...and this cd is most definitely worth every penny I spent on it.  From the first single \\"Me Against The Music\\"...to the one currently out \\"Toxic\\"..a song which I just love and in my opinion is the BEST track on the cd...so addictive, you can't help but sing along when it's playing in your cd player or on the radio. \\"Breathe On Me\\" is also very good, nice and sexy.  It's definitely a more risque disc and shows that Ms. Brit is growing up.
B00007GZVV|4.0|I know \\"What Dreams May Come\\" is a constant punching bag for movie critics alike and it wasn't exactly a blockbuster smash for Robin Williams but I sincerely like this film. I first saw \\"What Dreams May Come\\" when it was in the movie theaters. It was total eye candy with the gorgeous colors and the art-like quality. I felt like I was watching an artist creating his art work. The premise of the film is a bit silly. Robin Williams's character Chris is killed in a freak accident, leaving his emotionally unstable wife Annie played by Annabella Sciorra devasted and alone. The viewer also finds out that their two children were killed earlier in a car accident so when Chris dies, Annabella is  completely consumed by grief and chooses that life is not worth living any more. Chris is sent to heaven which is basically a Monet painting. The bright vivid colors were stunning and made it a joy to watch. Cuba Gooding Jr. welcomes Chris into the after life and eventually helps Chris in his quest to find Annie. At the time, I enjoyed the storyline but as I was watching it tonight on tv, I never realized until now just how hokey the storyline and dialogue could be. Despite the hokiness of the film, I still enjoy watching \\"What Dreams May Come\\". I think my favorite scenes had to be when Chris literally went to purgatory. The images and colors were spectacular. Those scenes of people falling from the waves as well as from the air and exploding when hitting the ground was stunning to say the least. Those scenes were pure eye candy. \\"What Dreams May Come\\" is a good movie. It isn't nowhere as emotionally manipulative as \\"Patch Adams\\" was except maybe for a few scenes that involved the children. Otherwise \\"What Dreams May Come\\" is a good popcorn movie. It may not be Masterpiece Theater but I will take this movie over something as tripe as \\"Patch Adams\\" or overblown as \\"Armaggedeon\\" any day.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|1: &quot;me against the music&quot;  i've heard this song so much on tv and radio that i already exausted but it still is an okay song.  *** (3 stars)<BR>2: &quot;i got that boom boom&quot;  ying yang twins are kinda annoying in this song but the chorus and the country melody gives it a nice touch.  ***  (3 stars)<BR>3:  &quot;showdown&quot;   the 1st time i heard this song i didn't like it because she was talking instead of singing but after i heard the chorus, i just loved it.  one of the best in the album.  *****  (5 stars)<BR>4:  &quot;breathe on me&quot;   not bad.  kinda catchy.   **** (4stars)

B0000UJL96|4.0|If you're in doubt about whether there's any value to Star Trek films for those outside their fanbase, I have two words for you: Nicholas Meyer.  No one who directed original cast or Next Generation Star Trek movies (not even Nimoy and certainly not Shatner) ever had a feel for what the whole series was about to equal Nick Meyer's.  ST II: The Wrath of Khan is arguably the best Star Trek episode ever (on film or TV, old generation or next), and Meyers' second effort is even better in some ways.  Chris Eidelmann's score is also the equal of James Horner's, appropriate to this darker tale.  Even if there had been no Star Trek universe for this story to play in, it would stand by itself as a very good film about friendship and the hopefulness for humanity that originally inspired Gene Roddenberry.  Absolutely worth your time, even if Star Trek's not your usual cup of tea.  &quot;It's about the future!&quot;
B00006ZCFH|5.0|What we need from Erykah is an album right now, not an EP. But, Erykah is a very talented artist and shows it here on this EP. So, all is forgiven. I was not really feeling this at first, but it grew on me and this is in heavy rotation right now. My favorite tracks are Back In The Day, I Want You(The intro is a little too long, but the song is classic) and Think Twice. I wish that she would have made World Keeps Turnin' a full song because I like the mellowness of it. Overall, this is a great EP, but it leaves me yearning for an album. If this is a sign of what to expect from the upcoming album, then it will be a banger!
B00006JKOL|1.0|Okay, this record actually has some small merit and deserves, in fact, a star or two more than one. I'm giving it only one, however, to counteract the exaggerated influence of the five-star Tull zombies. <br />Someone below calls this 1975 record the \\"beginning of Tull bombast\\". I think most critics would call \\"A Passion Play\\" (1973), rather, the beginning of Tull bombast. I would too, though I like most of \\"A Passion Play\\"--so much so that I'm willing to overlook what I don't like about it.  With the possible exception of \\"Songs From the Wood\\" (a wan fluke), that's it, however.<br />What went wrong? Well, we can only speculate, but notice that \\"Minstrel in the Gallery\\" is the first Tull to attribute production credit solely to Ian Anderson. Producer/manager Terry Ellis is gone, and there doesn't seem to be anyone left to tell Anderson when he's veered off course. <br />Some of the reviews make a bit of a fuss about Jeffrey Hammond. I find him fairly invisible here. During his entire five-album tenure, in fact, he seemed much less inclined to solo or fill than his predecessor, Glenn Cornick. Well, I do like Hammond's quasi-walking bass on \\"Aqualung\\" (the song), but I have a vague recollection reading somewhere that, though the liner notes credit the entire album to Hammond, Cornick actually played bass on this track.  By the way, Cornick was apparently pushed out of the band by Anderson, who preferred to have his best friend in the band, though Hammond at the time hadn't touched a musical intrument in years.<br />Anderson also pushed Mick Abrahams out because Anderson wanted to be sole singer and songwriter. That may well have been for the better, but I don't think drummer Clive Bunker's departure was. Barriemore Barlow is clearly much more of a technician than Bunker, but Bunker had much more style and personality, style and personality unriveled, in my opinion, by any rock drummer except The Police's Stewart Copeland. I consider, in fact,Clive Bunker just as important a part of Jethro Tull's sound as Ian Anderson. Without Bunker, \\"Thick as a Brick\\" and \\"A Passion Play\\" were just coasting, and with \\"WarChild\\" it became painfully clear Jethro Tull could coast no longer.<br />So, to sum up, I suggest three reasons:<br />1) With the increasingly ambitious, large-scale projects, \\"Aqualung\\", 'Thick as a Brick\\", and \\"A Passion Play\\", Ian Anderson had painted himself into a corner.<br />2) Without Clive Bunker the band had been living on borrowed time.<br />3) When he removed Terry Ellis (after having previously removed Mick Abrahams and Glenn Cornick), Ian Anderson finally pulled the rug out from under him.
B0001AP12G|5.0|I can't give this album a 5 because some of my favorite Kanye songs from the advance did not make this album(i.e. The Good, The Bad &amp; The Ugly, Home, My Way and Heavy Hitters). There may have been a problem getting the samples cleared for the album. Nonetheless, I looked forward to hearing these songs in better quality. Despite hearing them on the advance months before buying this album, I can't say that songs like Jesus Walks, Never Let Me Down, 2 Words or Through The Wire have lost their appeal to me. Maybe it is because the sound quality is better now or these songs might just be THAT good. Overall, this is a pretty good debut for a producer and the additions almost make up for the songs he left off(especially Spaceship). Lyrically, Kanye is pretty impressive. For example, he arguably outshines Jay-Z on Never Let Me Down, switches up his flow nicely on Get 'Em High and is  very introspective on tracks like the aforementioned Never Let Me Down, Jesus Walks, All Falls Down and Family Business. I could have done without a lot of the skits, but overall this is a very refreshing hip-hop album and could very well be a classic one day.<br />Highlights:<br />Jesus Walks<BR>Never Let Me Down<BR>Spaceship<BR>2 Words<BR>Through The Wire<BR>Get 'Em High (peep Common's verse)<BR>All Falls Down
630587493X|5.0|I am a big fan of Isaac Asimov and this story is one of my favorites!  Williams is excellent as a robot who wants to be accepted by society as a person.  Oliver Platt steals the movie as a robotics expert who continually &quot;improves&quot; Williams, making him more human each time.<br />Our heart goes out to Williams who continually argues his position in court, hoping to be legally declared a man!
630025111X|5.0|In my top 5 all time, captures a mood.  Love the Mama Cass theme song, touched my emotions deeply, in perfect unison with the movie.  Sad, uplifting, touching, meaningful, memorable, nostalgic.  I love it.
0800177363|5.0|Robert DeNiro in a totally different role as a boy who awakens from a coma, after many years, as a man!  Williams as the doctor who tries desperately to revive other patients like DeNiro and then act as a father and mentor to each.  Then later Williams tries everything humanly possible to keep his patients from relapsing to their former coma state.<br />The scene where DeNiro wakes up for the first time and puts his arms out with a big smile is one of my favorite movie scenes of all-time.  This was probably Robin Williams best role ever!
B000002B5L|5.0|Having listened to this on its first release in 1996, its only now that I've since dug it out for a listen, could an album with a remarkable impact on its release &amp; subsequently launching the solo careers of the 3 members, stand up to scrutiny nearly 7 years later??? Without a shadow of a doubt `Yes'....&amp; possibly even more relevant &amp; remarkable due to the ambivalence to the trio's solo work. \\"How many Mics\\" has always been possibly my favourite track with tightly woven lyrics rap wordplay via all three, with Lauryn &amp; Pras proving a revelation. \\"Fu-Gee-La\\", \\"Ready or Not\\" providing Contemporary soul &amp; Blues to a mainstream audience. But never forgetting that this album had an underlying social &amp; Political message (\\"The Beast\\" &amp; \\"Cowboys\\").....and dropping two of the most accomplished cover songs of \\"Roberta Flack's - Killing me softly\\" &amp; \\"Bob Marley's - No Woman, No Cry).  If you considering buying this album, buy in confidence, that this album has stood the test of time, and remains their career highmark, and you're still hankering from more `Fugees' after picking up the album, Lauryn Hill's \\"The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill\\" is the next logical step.
630471193X|5.0|This is a fun film about a country &quot;bumpkin&quot; who appears to be zapped in the head by something from the sky.  All of a sudden he becomes super smart and has telekenetic powers.  The more he tries to help the townspeople with his new wisdom and powers, the more they fear him and are also jealous of him.<br />Throughout the film the two people who stand by him are his best friend and the girl who makes wicker chairs (Kara Sedgewick) that he continually buys even though he doesn't need them.<br />When the truth to his condition is learned the government wants to exploit him and Travolta has to decide to either be a part of what they want or do what he wants.<br />Great film from beginning to end.
0385504209|2.0|Well, it started out to be interesting with a good plot that included murder in the Louvre, secret codes, messages written by the victim during his final minutes, treasure hunts, clues within clues.  But, there is no depth to the characters, no cohesion between lecture and action and no end to ridiculous conjecture, factual misrepresentation and theological misintrepretation.<br />I have never before read the end of a book before I naturally got to it, but in the case of The Da Vinci Code, I was compelled to out of sheer frustration.<br />In another vain, this book worries me.  Will people read it and believe Brown's lectures on Christianity, Catholicism, etc. as fact?  His history isn't even accurate.<br />In summation, I would describe this book as disappointing and frustrating to read.  I read a review that called the book &quot;perfect for ladies book clubs&quot; (which is why I read it).  That's insulting.
B00003CXXP|4.0|This Pinnocchio-like tale was highly enjoyable throughout but started to go downhill towards the end.  The actor that plays the boy is extremely talented and you really feel for him when he can't get the same affection as his &quot;human&quot; brother.  His search for affection has some dangerous consequences and leads his parents to abandon him in a very heart-wrenching scene.<br />He later meets and befriends a robot &quot;gigalo&quot; who tries to help him to attain his mother's affection.  They believe in the Pinnocchio story and feel if they can find the blue fairy, the fairy will turn the robot boy into a human and he will be able to get affection from his mother.
0553573403|5.0|oh my gosh, this book couldn't have been any better.  A little much on the whore aspect of the world, but over all I simply couldn't put it down.  I've personally just finished the third in this series about 5 min ago.  I am torn into 10 different people trying to understand motives, feeling sorrow for the Stark family, and joy for the few characters whose lives aren't being turned into horror and terror.  I love the way Martin creates the world through the character's eyes.  Each chapter is in the view of one of the characters and you really feel like you are those characters and learn the most of the world through this strategy.  It's simply amazing.
B0000AUHPK|5.0|Much better than the Timothy Dalton version.
B000002UAU|5.0|It's hard to believe that it was almost 40 years ago today that Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play!  Seriously, folks, what I am saying is that this music does not seem almost 40 years old, to these ears of mine, at least.  It has aged very well and continues to be listenable today, like pretty much all Beatles music.<br />With this album, the &quot;Fab Four&quot; showed how very diverse their styles had become, and that they were unafraid to experiment and try new musical things.  Attention &quot;Boy Bands&quot; of today!  Take a hint from the Beatles, THE &quot;Boy Band&quot; of all-time, and try something different if you don't want to go stale!<br />George Harrison's song &quot;Within You Without You&quot; is such a complete departure from the &quot;She Loves You&quot; days of the band, it's unbelievable.  For those who don't know, &quot;Within You Without You&quot; is set to traditional east Indian music!  There are, of course, still some &quot;poppish&quot; songs, such as &quot;Getting Better&quot;, but even this one contains some more &quot;adult-oriented&quot; lyrics, as Paul sings about how he used to beat his woman!  So it's not quite as easy-listening as their earlier material.<br />Definitely, a FIVE STAR ALBUM.  If you are a fan of music, you must buy this TODAY!  From AMAZON! :)
B00005Q4CS|5.0|So there I was-sitting quietly in my seat staring at a black television screen.  I did not move for about 5 minutes.  The power of this movie overwhelmed me.  Darren Aronofsky creates a 5 star-film with all-star performances, based on Hubert Selby Jr.'s compelling novel.  Masterfully put together, this movie is classed amongst my Top Ten list of Best Films of All-Time.  In fact, it is #1 presently.<br />The film's depiction of drug-abuse is overwhelmingly accurate as far as what drugs do.  But never did they really say what drug it was the four characters (Harry, Marion, Sara, and Tyrone) were using.  Drugs seems to be the device used to both promote and steal each of the entity's `dream,' thus the dreams of the four were already doomed from the beginning.  It was as if the drugs themselves were teasing each one, giving them the instant gratification they were seeking, then took everything away once they reached the a point on the road where it was too late to go back.<br />The musical score plays a significant role in the whole film's success.  Its bold and pervasive style composed by Clint Mansell and the Kronos Quartet help establish the film noir quality.  It truly plays a role that strengthens the viewer's emotions and attentiveness towards the film.<br />First time viewers, prepare your minds for an explosive rendition of the effects of drug-abuse.  Starring classic legend Ellen Burstyn, the appealing Jarod Leto, the exquisite actress Jennifer Connelly, and Marlon Wayans, generally known for his humorous films.  This is a film that will strike the eye, mind and heart.  Embrace yourself for a movie unlike any other!  And most of all, enjoy. :)

0679882820|5.0|My son loves this book.  I started reading it to him at 5 months old.  He enjoys the sounds and bright pictures.  He is now one years old and all I have to do is hold up the book and he gets a huge smile on his face.  This book is a keeper.
0140177396|5.0|This is a little book, less than 200 pages, that packs a big punch.  John Steinbeck tells the story of George and Lennie who travel around the Mid-West in the 1930's working as day laborers on large farms.  George is small in stature and &quot;street smart&quot; while Lennie is large, strong and &quot;intellectually challenged&quot; to be politically correct.  George and Lennie depend upon each other for companionship.  They are a kind of family.  Lennie looks up to George as a big brother.  George admires Lennie's physical size and strength.  You get the impression that one would be lost without the other.  George spends a lot of his time keeping Lennie out of trouble. Lennie wants rabbits to raise and George wants to be his own boss. They know where a little farm is for sale.  It's just what they want.  George and Lennie need six-hundred dollars to make this dream come true. For a while it looks as if the dream can become a reality.  Then trouble comes in the form of a woman. The ending, while you know what is coming, is a shocker.<br />This John Steinbeck classic is just as powerful in it's message today as it was in 1937.  George and Lennie together represent every person who has ever had a dream that they secretly knew was just out of their reach.  Together they support each other and keep their dream alive. <br />I had not read this book since high school, some 40 years ago.  I finished it in one setting.
B0000931OG|5.0|I wasn't sure what to think when I had heard that Graham Coxon, the guitar virtuoso of Blur had left the band. I was concerned on how the remaining members would get along with out the man who had been their guitar player for more than ten years. The first song off of Think Tank I heard was &quot;Out of Time&quot; needless to say my fears were alayed. The departure of Coxon is somewhat noticable, but not in a bad way. In general the guitar work isn't as intricate as it had been on previous Blur albums, but it gives Alex James and Dave Rowntree a chance to step up into the limelight, which they do with ease and gusto. The bass and drum work is outstanding as usual, but in general much easier to get a handle on. The departure of Graham also goes to show the listener exactly how versatile and brilliant a musician Damon Albarn actually is. There were a few songs that took a while to grow on me, but I think that this album contains some of their best work ever: &quot;Out of Time&quot; &quot;Good Song&quot; &quot;Sweet Song&quot; and &quot;Battery in Your Leg&quot; are brillaint ballads worthy of the Blur legacy. As with most Blur albums since Leisure the sound is all over the place, but uniformly excellent, do yourself a favor and buy this album. I don't care what the magazines told you, this was the best album of 2003.
B000062X90|5.0|ARGUS (REMASTERED &amp; REVISITED) is a great album by one of the most underrated British bands of all time. The opener, &quot;Time Was&quot;, in a very significant way, explains sentiments identical to why I chose not to attend my old school's Thanksgiving dinner; &quot;Warrior&quot;, using medeival imagery, is about standing up for your rights and not taking any bad stuff from anyone; and the rest of the tracks are all unique in their own way. Although the double-disc anthology TIME WAS presents a broader picture of Wishbone Ash's entire career, ARGUS (REMASTERED &amp; REVISITED) is a must-have.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Lost in Translation is not your average movie. It's more of a thinking comedy about people trying to connect in a city that is hard to fit in with. Sofia Coppola does a great job with the majesty of Tokyo but also shows the way people can get lost in it's huge tapestry of culture. Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson are great as the two lonely people trying to connect with themselves and the outside world, and we, the viewer are taking though this journey with them and are intrigued with their misadventures together.<br />It worth the word of mouth that it's getting, and I hope Bill Murray gets the Oscar because he is that good in it.
B00013PHGS|5.0|Although many feared a reprise of 10,000 Mhz Legend, Talkie Walkie is far more like Moon SaFari than that or The Virgin Suicides Sndtrk or Premiers Symptoms. However, Air manage to include tracks that could have been on those albums eg Another Day on Virgin Suicides, Biological or Mike Mills on Moon Safari, Run on Legend and Alone in Kyoto on Premiers Symptomes. For the other tracks (Cherry Blossom Girl, Venus, Universal Traveller, Surfin on a Rocket &amp; Alpha Beta Gaga) Air have modified the various ways in which they produced previous songs (remember its Nigel Godrich as producer, Radiohead's producer). <br />The other most notable feature is the manner in which JB &amp; Nicolas do all the vocals in the album, with voices that are angelic, wistful or just too fragile (like Surfin on a Rocket).<br />Air have even borrowed elements from Tre Storie Western, most notably on Universal Traveller (good tune but a pity about the lyrics!), Cherry Blossom Girl (best overall track) and Venus (excellent keychange-dirven effort). The guitars from Legend also feature to great effect on Surfin on a Rocket and Alpha Beta Gaga.<br />On repeated listening, the album tracks do tend to fade into discrete boxes like those I mentioned above, but anyone who enjoyed any of their previous albums/EPs will enjoy this album.<BR>Overall, this is the most eclectic album made by Air, however, having seen them live recently I believer they can still modify the songs to the heights reached in Moon Safari, among others.
B00008PW3Q|4.0|I broke down and tried this album.  I am a lover of the old FM but I had to give the new album a chance.  Once you get past the fact that it's all new (except 'Bleed to Love Her' which was on their reunion live cd) and Christine isn't one of the main members (although if you read the insert, she did help on the album) then the new beauty of the music starts to shine.  I also had to realize that it all wouldn't sound the way it does if John and Mick weren't behind the voices.  There isn't one bad song on this album, all of the writing is awesome, though there are some songs that feel more original FM and those songs are what got me through the rest.  It truely is a great album but you can't go into it thinking it's going to be the same, it's not, but that doesn't make it a bad thing.
0375701427|3.0|This book is about Swede Levov, the star of a high school in Newark.  The first 125 pages is an excellent book, as Swede contacts the author for a meeting, and our narrator offers observations and speculates about Swede's life.  Fine and good, maybe no Pulitzer, but a nice read.  Then many bad things happen to Swede, far out of any real relation to reality, and we realize the author's agenda.  In real life, he would be afraid of the Swede, a big, imposing guy.  In this book as an author, he controls the character, and has the ability to inflict great cruelties upon him, and the book takes on an unreal aura midway through the book.  Swede's daughter, a hippie, takes upon an unreal persona too.  Books like a delicate balance deserve these prizes, this is a good book which deteriorates.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Its a great movie!  I still watch the VHS version sometimes.  People really need to get a life and just appreciate the movie.  Two years ago it would have been perfect for you.  If you want widescreen, fine, wait until it comes out.  But stop cluddering the comments with this nonsense whining and just say how much you love the movie.<br />So anyway... Annie is a wonderful movie, no matter what format its in.  I recommend it to any and everyone.  It also works great on kids, my 2 year old niece doesn't move the whole time its playing!
B0001A79JO|5.0|Bought the album afew days ago. It blew me away. If your into psychobilly I suggest this band. Cannot WAIT to see this band once they get their U.S dates back up. Hoorah for Horrorpops!
B000002H33|5.0|Metallica is undoubtedly the greatest metal band ever. Anybody who gives this album one star is angry at the band over other issues or just trying to gain some support for megadeth. Master of puppets is in no way overrated or deserving of one star. Even though metallica changed drastically during the 90's, any real fan of metal can surely tell you that all of their 80's albums were flawless. Truly a great album, all of the tracks deliver their own unique sound.  Best songs include Disposable Heroes, Master of Puppets and Orion.
B00011D1RC|5.0|The Best Picture of 1931-2 &quot;Grand Hotel&quot; deserved it's Oscar and deserves it's place in history as a forerunner of star-studded films to come. The cast alone is worth watching the film for. But the film stands on it's own as well and is smoothly done considering the intertwining stories of various people whose paths (and fates) cross in that posh Berlin establishment. Greta Garbo as a depressed ballerina is one reason to see this but there's John and Lionel Barrymore in great roles, Joan Crawford as an ambitious stenographer with moral issues, Wallace Beery and other recognizable actors in character roles. Warner Bros. has done a good job with the DVD print so this is definitely a collector's item. There are some amazing interior shots inside the hotel with a wonderful art deco look to them. This hotel where &quot;nothing ever happens&quot; is a must for vintage classic film lovers. It's a rare treasure that's been wonderfully preserved for future film lovers to enjoy. See it for a classic look at what going to the movies in the 30's used to be about.
B00005JLXE|3.0|I first saw this movie out of one corner of my eye, while flying from Seattle to Houston.  What I saw left me unimpressed, and disinclined to buy the DVD.  I caught it on cable the other night, though, and I've got to say that despite the film's many flaws, I enjoyed watching it.<br />The flaws:<br />The first thing that struck me as silly was the scene where Daredevil and Elektra fight in a playground.  Well, the silly thing was that it was Matt Murdock (sans disguise) and Elektra fighting.  I couldn't help but think the man has no clue about what it takes to preserve a secret identity.<br />I also felt that the daredevil costume was poorly tailored.  The mask didn't look right, and the rest of it seemed to bunch up in weird places.  It was distracting.<br />Also, while the action was well choreographed and often creatively shot, the director (or somebody) didn't know when a move or a stance looks right.  When I see Jennifer Garner fight on \\"Alias\\", she's totally convincing, but here, both she and been Affleck often seemed to be off balance or moving awkwardly.  Better direction or editing could have fixed that.<br />Oh, and the dialogue was kind of weak all around. That's actually pretty forgivable for a comic book movie, but I don't like that it was bad enough to notice.<br />The good stuff:<br />The plot wasn't bad at all, and Ben Affleck did a pretty decent job with the substandard dialogue.  The visual style of the film worked pretty well, and the special effects were solid.  The action choreography and cinematography were solid, too.<br />Plus, hey, it's got Jennifer Garner...  That's almost enough to make up for any flaws.<br />Overall, I'd have to say I enjoyed the film despite its weak points, and was pleasantly surprised, given all the bad things I'd seen and heard about it.
B00005IC2H|1.0|After reading all the excellent reviews on this album, I decided to give it a listen as I am a huge Radiohead fan.  People--This aint Radiohead.  This was by far the worst album I have ever heard.  Check that, I couldn't make it past song 3? 4? I don't know but it was bad, real bad.  Please, for the love of God, don't buy this album.
B00006ZXSK|4.0|&quot;Ever After&quot; is an updated Cinderella story that works.  The intelligent screenplay, great casting and classy music/scenery make this movie, in my opinion, the best Cinderella movie to date.  Drew Barrymore turns in a luminous, strong performance as the servant-turned princess Danielle, with refreshingly updated points, i.e. her scholarship, swordsmanship and rescue of Prince Henry.  Dougray Scott does brilliantly as the sought-after Prince Charming, and adds dimension to his character, with a slightly rakish, sometimes haughty demeanor. The banter between him and Danielle has great chemistry, reminiscent of the same between Rhett and Scarlett in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;.  Anjelica Huston of course portrays the evil stepmother perfectly - not only pure evil, which she does turn out to be, but tinged with a reluctant affection for her stepdaughter.  <BR>I highly recommend this movie.  The DVD version is my only complaint - bare bones, just a trailer, no behind the scenes look, no commentary, nothing.  For such a classy film, viewers would have appreciated more features in the DVD.
0446310786|5.0|Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird was the second book that I ever read about a family in the South that encounters racism.  This book is absolutely amazing... so amazing that I read it three times.  Oh, I don't mind telling you that all three times, I fell asleep reading the beginning.  However, the story, the emotion, the characters are just... WOW!  No one reads this book and doesn't LOVE it !^_~
0780020685|5.0|Unlike many of today's techo-violence shockers, this film speaks to us from a simpler time: a primer on community defence and the social impact of character, what it means, on a personal level to be a soldier, and human.  No one is more human, more vulnerable, and in the end, a finer warrior, than Mifune's character, brilliantly played.  The acting is uniformally great. All the samurai depicted still inspire, and the realism, as always with Kurosawa, moves us.  A terrific value.
B0001AP158|5.0|Wow! I bought this DVD on the day of release and am proud to say that Bon Jovi have done it again! Totally, totally awesome. So glad I bought it :) Go ahead and get it if you're in doubt! Bon Jovi made a brave move when they decided to totally transform their songs, but I believe that they have been truly successful in the transformation. Either way, all the songs are great and the DVD itself it fantastic. Selling like hot-cakes over here ;) Get out and get it!
B0000BYM3K|3.0|Well, I waited a long time to write a review of this because I wanted to let the record sink in. Ultimately, my initial gut reaction still stands. There is some great stuff on here, and some really bad stuff. <br />As for the good: &quot;Rainmaker&quot; is beautiful, shows that you can write a fast heavy song that is intensely emotional. &quot;No More Lies&quot; is epic, probably my favorite on the album, and one of the better songs that Maiden has recorded in the last 10-15 years. &quot;Montsegur&quot; is fantastic, a great Maiden history lesson-soon to be classic, intelligent lyrics, and quite heavy. Of course, it's overshadowed by &quot;Paschendale&quot; which is flawless, an incredbily well constructed song, everything works on this track. &quot;Face in the Sand&quot; is fantastic, Nicko's drumming in the first 2-3 mins. is insane, probably the best lyrics on the album. And &quot;Journeyman&quot; i'm not crazy about, but I appreciate them experimenting, and I hope they do more of it in the future.<br />As for the bad: I'm sorry, but I think &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; is AWFUL, they never should have made it the first single. The lyrics are as silly as &quot;Running Free&quot; (great song, don't get me wrong, but the lyrics are kind of dumb) and it's not a good sign when the lyrics you write on your 13th album are as silly as the ones you write on your first! Plus, the song is just really boring, really generic, really disappointing. &quot;Dance of Death&quot; well, it IS a great song in some ways, but it's SO Spinal Tap, the lyrics are laughable, and the music just sounds too much like &quot;Lord of the Dance.&quot; Very, very cheesy, guilty pleasure at best. And the other songs &quot;Gates of Tomorrow&quot; &quot;New Frontier&quot; and &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; are just totally average, nothing special. And I think the lyrics to &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; are really simplistic and reactionary, but that could just be my own political bias. <br />Bottom line, Iron Maiden is one of the most talented metal bands of all time, and after &quot;Brave New World&quot; I was expecting an absolutely brilliant album. This is NOT it. But, there's plenty of great stuff on here, and I'll buy the next IM whenever it comes out!
B000002LFU|5.0|End of the old or beginning of the new?  Classic either way.  A must own.
B00004RF8J|5.0|Well, after much research it would seem the rumor, myth, what have you is true. The 2000 issue of the DVD is a 2nd edition of the DVD. Not a reissue of the first.<br />The 2000 DVD (ISBN 0-85391-83252-2) is different from the (often talked about) first edition that was pulled from the shelves within 48 hours in 1998 by command of David Geffen. The original lot was destroyed. The only ones to survive were the ones purchased in those first few hours. Checking my disk I have ISBN: 0-85391-17022-8<br />I have yet to contrast the two DVDs to see if the content is in fact different. Regardless, check the used discs you may aquire as this one (on collectors boards) is going for as high as $225. Which for a six year old disk (this review was written in 2004) is not bad at all.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|Anybody giving this CD anything less than 3 stars is doing it simply for the reason that they have a personal vendetta against Britney Spears. The album has some amazing tracks on it, and yes, it's true, one or two crappy ones.  But overall, in the scheme of the whole CD, Britney has managed to craft a jivey, trancy, pulsating collection of songs that pretty much anybody can just pop into their CD player and rock out to. It's a good buy and I really recommend it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I've watched all of the DVDs in the set many times since I bought it.  Only bad thing about it is there's no more and I'm left not knowing who the preacher is, who those guys with the blue hands are, and most importantly where the reavers will strike next.  Hopefully the movie will answer some of my questions and the series will then be restarted to answer the rest...
B00000G3HZ|5.0|I originally saw this movie when it first came out back in the early 80's.  Its been a long time and in the interim I had forgotten many of the finer qualities, nuances and excellent performances that make this movie such a great one.<br />It goes beyond seeing the delectable Kevin Kline so young and<br />jogging around in the then sylish short shorts.<br />It is watching the subtle expressions on the face of William Hurt (excellent acting) and the icy-ness (in different ways) of JoBeth Williams which got even colder as the film wore on and the coldness to warmth in Glen Close.  Jeff Goldblum is deliciously slimy and Mary Kay Place wore the same hair style and many of the same outfits that I wore back then.<br />Despite the trip down memory lane, the main story remains intact<br />whether this was filmed yesterday and today.  Why do some people<br />lose their hope and choose to turn away from life... and why do<br />others remain?<br />Why do we forget the sweetness of freshness in exchange for the<br />hubbub of the demands of daily life?<br />Why do we lose touch with people with whom we share such<br />intense connection?<br />How far would you go and how much would you give for your friends?<br />This movie will continue to travel with me over the next several<br />days... its just one of those movies.  I am so glad I revisited it now that I have grown past the age of the players... and I am<br />glad I saw it before, when I was just stepping into adulthood.<br />This would be a great one to watch with high school aged<br />children to get them thinking about these big questions when<br />they are still young... while they might not &quot;get&quot; it at the time,I have a feeling it will stick with them..... at least a little... and echo through their thoughts in the days and years to come.<br />Let's also not forget the incredible music, beautiful background scenery and the variety of stories scattered throughout the main story line all woven together in this marvelous, tasty tapestry.  Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy.tapestry.  Enjoy, Enjoy, Enjoy.
B00018D44U|1.0|The thing that amazes me more than anything is the amount of albums that this lady has sold.  It just doesn't make any sense to me.  Just who is it that she knows that makes critics hail her?  This is the kind of music that nobody should ever be forced to deal with.  Don't Know Why has been her only hit, yet somehow it was enough to sell 8 million records.  This album is absolutely depressing.  If this is supposedly the best artist in recent years, it's no wonder why music sales have declined so much.  In 10 years people will have already forgotten who Norah Jones was.  People talk about how the love her voice.  If you got a 6 yeary old with a sour throat to sing, I guarantee it would sound identical to Norah's voice.
B0000C7PRY|4.0|Like most Transatlantic and Spock's Beard fans, I was somewhat saddened to learn that Neal Morse had not only left the band(s), but had quit the music business altogether. What a waste of someone so talented, thought I. Thus I greeted the arrival of Testimony with some anticipation. Needless to say I wasn't disappointed.<BR><BR>The album is the very personal story of our erstwhile Mr Morse's journey through a spiritual crisis and his eventual discovery of religion. I am not a religious person, so the lyrics didn't always connect with me the way his other songs have, but I appreciate the honesty and genuine emotions put forward. With that said, the music is absolutely stunning. It seems that the time off has actually improved his compositional and arrangement skills. His ear for a great melody hasn't vanished either. There are some truly beautiful tracks on this album, Wasted Life, Overtures 1 and 2 and Transformation chief among them. I also suspect that Kerry Livgren's influence goes beyond the solo he contributes on one song. Some tracks have that same majesty and grandeur of classic Kansas music of old (this is a good thing in my opinion)<BR><BR> In the end, I found this to be a fine return to music for Neal Morse and one hopes that continues to make music, particularly if it's of this standard. Fans of Spock's Beard will certainly find plenty to like here, as I did. The lyrics may turn some listeners off, but I didn't find them too preachy. The quality of the music is alone worth the price of admission IMHO.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said before.
B000084T18|1.0|To name a few debut albums less successful in sales but with a superior quality to this one: 36 Chambers by Wu Tang, Illmatic by Nas, Doggy Style Snoop Dogg, Dre's solo debut The Chronic, Reasonable Doubt by Jay Z, 2Pacalypse by 2Pac. A few other superior albums: Midnight Marauders by A Tribe, Thug Life Vol1 2Pac, Illadelph Roots, Liquid Swords GZA/Genius, Aquemini Outkast. Do not dirty your hands with this commercial, weak scum: Mainstream and talent are mutually exclusive.
B0000D96NW|5.0|man what a good cd machine head are back this is my fav mh cd so far 10 songs 53.44 mins long phil rules and his solos do to so if you  like true metal then go and buy this know stay metal
0312853238|5.0|The Ender series has become known, over time, as the definitive sociological science-fiction masterpieces.  This sounds a little boring and doesn't do Ender's game justice.  This book is one of the most fun, edge-of-my-seat books I have ever picked up.  I can't imagine anyone who wouldn't enjoy reading it.  <br />You should buy a copy for your parents, and one for your kid, they'll both love it.  And two copies for yourself, just in case you ever lose you.
B00007L4MJ|1.0|Currently (review the date of this post), I ordered this DVD, and it was defective.  It would not play past Chapter 24 (audio would sometimes work, but the video was black or completely distorted).  Amazon shipped a replacement, but, the second DVD had the same defect.  I tried it on several different players, including dvd players and computer players, with similiar issues.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|Superb score to a wonderfully exciting and emotional film.  Nevermind that he is probably the most prolific film scorer, all of that is irrelvent when a composer comes into his or her own to create a truly evocative, intensely emotional, and visceral work which is what Zimmer's music for THE LAST SAMURAI truly is.  Now while I have enjoyed his past work I must say that it is Zimmer's music for The Last Samurai that does what truly great movie scores do, give its film heart and soul.  It makes you feel the rush and exitement in the battle scenes, the pain of loss, and the poignancy of Algren's return to the village in the end, all without bombast or sappiness.  Every note is felt, every melody purposeful, and every theme explored to its fullest.  Easily the best work Zimmer's done yet and certainly the best score of 2003.   A.M.P.A.S. should be embarassed for not giving an Oscar nomination to Zimmer for this.
B000002NIW|1.0|bitching, complaning, whining, all there is. just makes you depressed. people just say they like this crap. nobody really enjoys it.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I have to admit that I didn't catch but two episodes while it was on the air, but after receiving this DVD set as a gift I have been fully converted.  If you have only seen the out-of-sequence airing on FOX or felt confused because you didn't get to see the ever-so important pilot (the one that introduces the universe and characters) I can only say you should give it another chance.<br />The show is full of wit and humor, interesting and likeable characters, amazing special effects, and features cursing in Mandarin Chinese.
0440238609|1.0|A quote from the third book: \\"I used to be a nun, you see. I thought physics could be done to the glory of God, till I saw there wasn't any God at all and that physics was more interesting anyway. The Christian religion is a very powerful and convincing mistake, that's all.\\"<br /><br />Please be aware: This trilogy, while exceedingly well-written, blatantly promotes and teaches atheism--particularly in the third installment.  It is also anti-Christian.  Comparing this author to C.S. Lewis is more than misleading; it is a disservice to well-meaning parents who have no idea what they're actually giving their kids.  The top-rated reviews offer no help in this area, and I would encourage the authors to revise and at least add just a sentence.  If atheism is such a legitimate concept, why hide it and slip it into kids' minds under the guise of a \\"C.S. Lewis-like\\" author?<br /><br />I gave it one star because of its misleading nature--particularly in the marketing. It's wrong to try to slip this into unsuspecting homes and lie about its themes.
0316776963|4.0|i laughed alot but not as much as i was supposed to. not alll of it was funny but it was pretty good.
0440237688|5.0|Aside from \\"The Giver\\" being an amazing read by means of entertainment, I was fascinated with the fact that it truly is a book for all ages.  When I first read this book in 6th grade for school, I thoroughly enjoyed the basic storyline and theme of the story.  I was old enough to decipher the main idea of the novel.  Now, a junior in high school, I was able to appreciate and enjoy so much more while reading \\"The Giver\\" for the second time.  The apparent importance of emotions, individualism, memories and even the gift of sight was revealed.   I definitely recommend this book to everyone!
0316666343|5.0|Schedule time for reading this novel, because once you start, you can't put it down.  I read it in 24 hours, drove it to someone I knew would love it and she read it in 24 hours.  She immediately took it to someone else.... It's that kind of book.  You soak it up and then want to share it.
B0000YEEHG|5.0|Persona brings two very different characters, Alma (Bibi Andersson) and Elisabeth (Liv Ullman), to the screen.  Alma is a nurse who has been designated to personally care for Elisabeth, who has had a &quot;breakdown&quot; after performing as Electra which was written by Sophocles.  Elisabeth has decided to remain silent forever, and Alma is attempting to nurse her back to speech.  The use of Electra adds a subtle touch by Bergman which can help the understanding of Liv Ullman's character in the film, since the whole film is an artistic event as it displays the convergence of Alma and Elisabeth.  As the two women come together Bergman maximizes the situations and atmospheres by balancing contrasts, which enhances the emotional experience in the film.  In addition, Persona offers a cinematic experience with contrasts as the story is compassionate and callous, which appears through the magical touch of Bergman's direction.  The film presents several personal interpretations as well as several common interpretations as great art is known to do.  Therefore, Bergman puts forward a brilliant cinematic experience which is unmatched in film history.
B000002UA9|5.0|Until this album came out in 1963,albums consisted of about 1 good song and a lot of filler... please please me changed all that,here was a album that was great from start to finish (which is why it held down the number 1 spot for 30 consecutive weeks at the time)!
B00005NTN5|4.0|For warchild27: Yes, on track 18 of my DVD, Joey Pants' commentary cuts out for most of the rest of the track. From track 19 on, the commentary should be fine. However, I bought a used copy which has visible scratches. If your audio cuts out on some other track than 18, then you have a defective disk (and so do I).<br />Film is an actor's film, rich in suspense and nuance. Joey Pants is great as always. Tilly is odd, and Gina Gershon is a bit disappointing to me, but all of the character actors were great, especially Law &amp; Order SVU's Christopher Meloni, a riot as a whacked-out psychopathic henchman. <br />I was a bit disappointed in the editing, although some shots and editing are clever. Some of the editing decisions are explained in the commentary, which I found to be a hoot and which genuinely enriched my experience of the film. Too bad all of the stars showed up late for the commentary session, Tilly and Gershon coming in about 30 minutes before the end of the flick!<br />This is not a lesbian suspense film; it's a suspense film in which the protagonists are lesbians. The film attempts, I think successfully, to make their lesbianism seem normal.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|&quot;Firefly&quot; is Joss Whedon's first expedition into science fiction, a genre completely different from earlier creations of his like &quot;Buffy&quot; and &quot;Angel&quot;.  In a way, it's a much finer vintage than either, strengthened by his years of experience in imaginative storytelling.  The series tells the story of Serenity, a Firefly-class space transport, and her crew.  <br />Each character of the main cast is memorable, and as the series progresses you gain more empathy for each of them.  Malcolm Reynolds, the former Independent who fought (but lost) against the tyrannical Alliance alongside his first mate, Zoe.  Wash, Zoe's husband and a pilot of exceptional talent.  Kaylee, young and boy-crazy mechanic savant.  Jayne, the greedy and less-than-bright muscle.  Inara Serra, courtesan and Companion (a social class which is highly esteemed in this culture).  And the passengers:  Shepherd Book, a priest whose background is shaded in mystery.  Simon and River Tam, fugitive siblings, he a talented trauma surgeon, she a intuitive genius who had been the guinea pig of some mysterious group's experiments.<br />The series' stories are well-written, though primarily episodic rather than plot-arc-based.  They have much more of a sense of realism than most space-opera type shows (Star Trek, for example), and that's one of the things that draws a viewer's attention.  There are no aliens, no &quot;bumpy forehead&quot; prosthetics -- it's just humans, alone in the black.  Fox, the production company, chose to hamstring the series and cancel it before it really got off to a solid start.  Nonetheless, the DVD set of the series is well worth buying -- it's one of the finest bits of storytelling around.
0743243307|1.0|I really regret having bought and having read this book.  The first few pages seem to start off well, with the birth of the main character Nazeen.  Appearing to be a still born she somehow comes back to life after which her parents decide that she should not be taken hospital but instead be Left To Her Fate.  This of course becomes the central theme of the book, how she struggles with taking action or being passive in her life.  At first the book's start impressed me, but after a while it dawned on me she stole this idea from Rushdie, who often has a very dramatic event occur within the first few pages that becomes symbolic for events thereafter.  But Rushdie doesn't beat the symbolism to death!  He leaves it there for you to discover.  In Brick Lane literally hundreds of times we are reminded that Nazeen was Left To Her Fate.  So even this apparently good (although plagiarized) opening is spoiled.  The rest of the book is basically just drivel, with the exception of one decent passage while Nazeen son is in the hospital.  I've read books with 1 dimensional characters, but as I read this book I was wondering if it was possible to have 0 dimensional characters and events?  Characters so lacking they suck out your personality as you read?  The end of the book is just a nose dive into abysmal.  It's so bad its offensive.  Nazeen leaves her apartment to go looking for her daughter and spots a young girl somewhere and remarks, \\"Nazeen had learned to recognize the face of a refugee child that traumatized stillness, the need they have to learn to play again\\". Not only is this overly sentimental, up until this point there had been no mention of refugees or the struggles of refugees.  What offends me here is that this book does not handle any big issues (racism, poverty, refugees,..) it co-opts them, and it rubs me the wrong way just the same way that those Shell Oil commercials claiming they care about the environment did.  Even the title, Brick Lane, which is a trendy ethnic area in London, feels dishonest to me.  Brick Lane would be a great title for a book about poverty, ghettos and gentrification; of course nothing that real is ever mentioned. If you want to read trash then at least read honest trash, this book is trash and dishonest.
0440180295|5.0|One of the things that I love about Slaughterhouse Five (and many of Vonnegut's other books as well) is how the sci-fi elements are there, but they are not the focal point of the story, nor of the characters.<br />The sheer mention of Tralfamadore rockets this novel into the classification of science fiction. Yet, despite the \\"popping between time\\" of Pilgrim that tries to defy a physical setting, the story remains solidly anchored within an emotional setting: the bombing of Dresden (WWII), which keeps everything in perspective. Tralfamadore, and many of the \\"non-linear\\" qualities of the story could as easily be the creation and fixation of a weakened mind, just as much as they could be (?) real. You never know. Vonnegut always keeps you guessing.<br />SH-5 is a great introduction to Vonnegut. If you enjoy this one, I would recommend moving in either one of two ways: for those who liked the character elements and emotional qualities, move to \\"Bluebeard\\". For those who were more intrigued by Pilgrim's temporal displacement, try \\"The Sirens of Titan\\" next.
B00005YW4H|5.0|When I first heard a tiny clip of Norah Jones voice on a television newscast about the grammies, I told my husband that I have to find out who that enchanting, smooth and tonal voice belongs to.  I had never even heard of her prior to that time.  <br />As soon as I heard the name of the artist, I ordered my Norah Jones CD from Amazon.  This music has gotten into my soul.  I hum her tunes constantly.  I even wake up in the middle of the night with her songs on my mind.  <br />I like all the songs on this CD, but my favorites are, &quot;Come Away With Me,&quot; &quot;Don't Know Why,&quot; &quot;Cold, Cold Heart,&quot; and &quot;Turn Me On.&quot;<br />The lady has got style!  I'm glad I bought this CD.
B00005JME0|5.0|I loved this movie so much. It is so different that Ashton's usually dorky, hott teen self, but he played such a dramatic part. I thought about this movie for 3 days strait after I saw it---It really hit me hard. And then I had to go back and see it again. If you like twisted movies, a little disturbing, but a really good film, definetly go see it!!!
0393057658|4.0|This book is about the power of critical thinking.  It traces the moves made by a general manager--Billy Beane--who, with the help of statistical geeks, was able to find undervalued players and dish off overvalued players.  The author points out that players are commonly misappraised because their value is generally tied to things like &quot;looks&quot; and statistics like &quot;batting average&quot; and &quot;rbis&quot; and &quot;saves&quot; and &quot;fielding percentage&quot; which do not adequately reflect the extent to which a player's performance contributes to value to his team.  For example, Mr. Lewis describes formulas which have been derived that accurately predict the number of runs a team will score over the course of a season, and these formulas do not depend on some very commonly used (or misused! stats) After you read this book you will get the point that on-base percentage is 3X more valuable than slugging percentage in the formulas.  One drawback of the book is that the formulas discussed are not explicitely stated and their validity is not conclusively demonstrated. Another aspect of the book I also wish was expressed in more detail is the new set of pitching statistics that are devoid of any aspect of luck commonly built into today's commonly advertised stats, like &quot;wins&quot; and &quot;era.&quot;  In the end, the lesson of the book is that you must always ask, &quot;why, why, why.&quot;  Why do I care if this pitcher has 30 saves?  Why do I care if this outfielder made 10 errors. This books explains in a fun way why you shouldn't necessary care about these questions at all!
B000002UAX|5.0|In November of 1968, The Beatles released their self-titled album which was their only double album released when they were together. The album was nicknamed The White Album because of its stark white cover as an antithesis to the extravagance of Sgt Pepper. The album is a great album and is one of the best albums ever made. This album has every music genre conceivable included from rock(Back in the USSR, Dear Prudence, Glass Onion, While My Guitar Gently Weeps(featuring Eric Clapton on lead guitar), Happiness is a Warm Gun, I'm So Tired, Why Don't We Do It in the Road, Birthday, Yer Blues, Everybody's Got Something to Hide, Sexy Sadie, Helter Skelter, Long Long Long, Savoy Truffle) to pop(Oblidi Oblada, Martha My Dear, Revolution #1) to acoustical numbers(Blackbird, I Will, Julia, Mother Nature's Son and Cry Baby Cry) to country(Rocky Racoon and Don't Pass Me By(Ringo's first song written for the band)) to comedical numbers(The Continuing Story of Bungalow Bill, Piggies) to weird(Wild Honey Pie, Revolution #9) to jazz(Honey Pie) and a lullaby(Good Night). Surprisingly, this album worked very well and still holds up today. This album is the group's best selling album ever in the US with some 18 million copies sold according to the RIAA although Abbey Road is the best selling single disc. If you need another Beatles disc aside Abbey Road and Sgt Pepper, scoop up The White Album. Duran Duran are a nostalgia act who reunited for the money unlike Tbe Beatles who retired on TOP!
B000002ILG|5.0|\\"Pride\\" (1987) was my very first introduction to White Lion and remains my favorite album by the band. This album is an absoluteley flawless work of art. Mike Tramp (Who sounds a bit like a cross between Megadeth's Dave Mustaine and Testament's Chuck Billy) has a talented and unique vocal style that mixes perfectly with one of my guitar heros, Vito Bratta. Ex-Anthrax drummer Greg D'Angelo has a powerful 80's style to his snare and kick drums while bassist James Lomenzo rocks awesome on the 4-string. \\"Pride\\" begins with the catchy and heavy song \\"hungry\\", which instantly grabs the listener. Next comes \\"Lonely Nights\\" which is also a very catchy song and has an absolutely phenomenal solo by Vito Bratta. \\"Don't Give Up\\" and \\"Sweet Little Loving\\" are also great songs with awesome guitar riffs and suprises. Then comes the more serious \\"Lady of The Valley\\" which features a great variety of tempo changes, mixtures of acoustic and electric guitar, and some very beautiful harmony, including a mysterious but awesome solo. \\"Wait\\" is another excellent song with great rhythm and tapping work by Vito. \\"All You Need Is Rock N Roll\\", \\"Tell Me\\", and \\"All Join Our Hands\\" are also very great songs with exceptional metal chemistry and breath-taking solos.  Last but not least comes \\"When The Children Cry\\", which is a very surreal ballad that is put together as a beautiful ensemble of acoustic guitar and harmony. In this song, Vito plays an extremely emotional solo, which could literally bring tears to your eyes. I can't conjure up enough postive compliments about \\"Pride\\" and White Lion. It upsets me that some reviewers think of Vito Bratta as merely \\"a rip-off of Eddie Van Halen.\\" I can bet that most of those negative reviewers have never went out and bought a guitar and an amp and tried to play in any articulate manner and appreciate how difficult it actually is. No offense to Van Halen (I happen to like Van Halen), but when you put White Lion next to Van Halen, White Lion blows Van Halen away. Van Halen made maybe 2 good albums (with Roth), but all 4 White Lion albums are so much more musically satisfying. Vito Bratta shows us joy and sorrow, love and hate, hope and despair and every human emotion with his guitar. Eddie Van Halen shows us talented tapping which is neat, but gets repetitive after a while. Vito Bratta remains the most unrecognized and profound guitarist in heavy metal. Vito Bratta is the only guitarist who's hypnotizing guitar skills have left tears in my eyes after listening, which is not easy to accomplish and is something that Eddie Van Halen has not even come close to. It's really unfortunate that White Lion was only around for such a short amount of time and that they were so extremely underrated. White Lion made the choice to not go for the gold and girls which definitely seperated them from the less talented musicians and made them less popular. Instead of singing about sex, money, and girls, White Lion emphasized on more serious issues in the world such as relationships, war, family abuse, rights, and freedom. It was also the early 90's grunge movement that eventually ended many of my favorite band's carriers. Grunge pushed a lot of great 80's heavy metal bands out of the way and then creeping up out of no where in the lime light came(c)rap \\"music\\" which really screwed things up. In conclusion, \\"Pride\\" was one of the albums that I lived on throughout highschool and it always brings back a lot of memories when I listen to it.  If you don't have this album, if you love 80's heavy metal, and you don't want to be dissapointed, White Lion's \\"Pride\\" is the ideal start. I also strongly suggest \\"Fight To Survive\\", \\"Big Game\\", \\"Mane Attraction\\" and \\"The Best of White Lion.\\" Long Live White Lion! ROCK N' ROAR!!!
B000005DQR|5.0|Call it Trip-Hop, Hip-Hop, or rap, DJ Shadow really makes you think. For example, with an intro like &quot;Best Foot Foward&quot;, you can truly believe you're going to go on a musical journey. The scratches are not repetative and the samples make you wonder: &quot;Where did he get that from&quot;? One of my personal favorites has got to be &quot;Mutal Slump&quot;. He truly blends Bjork's &quot;Possibly Maybe&quot; sample just right and the song makes your mind and body beg for more of the song. Also, &quot;The Number Song&quot;, which is THE most dancable song in the album, has a B-Boy-ish feel to it and the scratches are tight. &quot;Organ Donor&quot; is really different, but works. Overall, this album really is genius and highly recommend to anyone who likes all kinds of music and is open-minded. And for all you new readers, FYI: This album was aknowledged in the 2001 Guiness Book of Records for &quot;Most samples in any album&quot; (&quot;Entroducing&quot; is 100% sampled). Cool, huh?!
B000005DSN|5.0|This is a great album for one of the best Finnish bands. Their legacy is continuing in an extreme way. Here's my rating for every song.<br />The Kiss Of Judas: Outstanding opener and I loved the opener bass and the atmosphere is great. Beautiful. 5/5<br />Black Diamond: The single of the album is great and the solo part in undescribable. The mood is really cool. 5/5<br />Forever Free: My second favorite song, and it so energetic and great lyrics. The solo sounds so good that in a while a nuclear bomb will drop in your room. 5/5<br />Before The Winter: I liked it how it started then I wished they added another verse before they begin with the solo, but still it is good. This is a soft ballad song. 4.5/5<br />Legions: Great chorus and this one could be the fastest song on the album and it really good. 5/5<br />Abyss Of Your Eyes: Somehow it is similar to &quot;The Kiss Of Judas&quot; musically. Lyrically it is good, but it takes awhile to like. 4.5/5<br />Holy Light: This is an instrumental track and when you listen to it, you'll this is Dream Theater are playing because it is so identical to their style and it is cool. 5/5<br />Paradise: Awesome track, but not my favorite. I loved the lyrics in a way, but the chorus really kicks you in the n**ts. 4.5/5<br />Coming Home: WOW! WHAT A GREAT SONG! As you can see this is my favorite song on the album. It has a great mood and another soft ballad. I repeat this song ten times and I can't get enough. 8.5/5<br />Visions (Southern Cross): And here's the title song and it is a ten minute song. It is beautiful and outstanding and great solo. This is a bomb of a track, but it needs time to like. 5/5<br />This is one great album and I recommend to the fans of Dream Theater and Blind Guardian. Hail also to Finland because it is keeping Metal rise with attitude.
B000088E77|5.0|The title for Men at Work's debut album says it all: Business as Usual(good straight rock songs with a reggae influence). This album is a classic. &quot;Who Can it Be Now&quot; and &quot;Down Under&quot; are still great songs. The reason why these guys called it quits so early was because they knew when to stop unlike those turds Turdran Turdran! Turdran Turdran, over time fizzled out and despite one fluke comeback in 1993, they are now a nostaliga band whom are in it for the money. If you like music from Australia, then you have many options: AC/DC, Jet, Olivia Newton-John and Men at Work. Avoid the fool Kylie Minogue who will be a two-hit wonder, mark my words!

0553583182|5.0|I would give the book 3.5 MILLION Stars if I could. The knowledge presented in this book have transformed and completely changed my life.  Before you read this please note:<br />this book is NOT about religion.<br />1) Pick an area of your life that you want to change.<br />2) Use the scientific, specific methods described in this book<br />3) SEE THE RESULTS WITH YOUR OWN EYES.<br />IMPORTANT POINT: You MUST suspend all doubt and have FAITH for it to work (JM show you how).<br />Another point: although spirituality and religion are closely related, you do NOT have to be a churchgoing Christian to enjoy the divine benefits of the truths presented here.  Even if you are an atheist, I think this book especially will work for you.  Why? Because you are less tied to traditional dogma.  Once you see the changes in your life that occur through these teachings you doubtless will change your views on a \\"Higher Power\\", but that is between you and the One who made you.<br />NOTE TO OPEN-MINDED PEOPLE: I think that in today's world, people don't want to be told \\"just take what I tell you as fact\\". In other words, if you are an intelligent, open-minded person, you want SCIENTIFIC proof (i.e. a method, a hypothesis, observed cause, effect, results).  Well in our modern times, we seem to believe that our rational side is more important than our spiritual, intuitive side.  What I'm saying here is this book shows you the bower of both!<br />Now, you might be saying to yourself \\"I've been told all my life just have faith or just believe...\\".  Well this books shows you a scientific method for developing faith and belief.<br />Whenever you have doubts, fear, worry, anxiety, etc. pop up use JM's techniques, \\"God/Infinite Intelligence/The Principle of Good in the World (whatever you want to call it, it really doesn't matter one damned bit!) loves me, therefore wants the best for me\\".<br />Or<br />\\"The Power in me that gave me this desire is the power that is fulfilling it\\".<br />This book shows you that as long as your desires 1)follow the golden rule, 2)the law of love and above all that 3)you BELIEVE, there is nothing absolutely nothing in this life you cannot attain. The teachings presented in this book show the utter tragedy of life: we limit ourselves, God, the universe, etc. doesn't.  He has demonstrated this and God bless him forever and a 10 days for being the instrument through which these internal truths were brought to light to me and to the world.<br />Don't let the filthy, disgusting, vile thieves into your temple of: doubt, worry, feelings of unworthiness, anxiety, fear.  Kicks them out of your life forever!!<br />What do you have to loose?  Now if you are like me, you feel that \\"seeing is believing\\", so let me share my experiences using the methods, truths, knowledge, etc. as outlined in this book.<br />Some time ago, I found myself living in a crappy apartment in New York city, with a crappy job.  You could see the trash on the streets, the loud neighbors, the totally hopeless co-workers I worked with.  However, I had better visions for myself.<br />I envisioned myself living splendidly on another continent, enjoying wonderful social engagements, meeting the worlds best and brightest.  I'm talking great dinner parties, art museums, cruises, clean air and water, a closer relationship with God/Higher self, etc.<br />Using JM's techniques, I envisioned myself meeting a Nobel Prize winner, and seeing the sun set while on the decks of a cruise ship to wonderful parts of Europe.  I also saw myself in the lecture halls of a very prestigious university.<br />Keep in mind that at the time that vision was as far away from my present material reality as humanly possible (anyone who knows what a cramped New York city apartment looks like can identify).<br />I envisioned myself there, I BELIEVED in this vision, I held on it it.  Time went one.  One day, about 2pm on a Thursday, I looked around my desk at work and I said, \\"THIS IS IT!!\\" I had broken up with my partner, I hated my job, I had had enough. I turned to the infinite power within me and everything happened so effortlessly, it seems almost unfair the changes that that rolled into my life happened so easily.  I quite my job.  I booked a flight.  I moved to another country.  The day I arrived I had no apartment.  About 23 hours later, the power of my subconscious (i.e. my Higher Self), found me an apartment.  I was admitted to a prestigious university, for which I am pay NOT ONE RED SENT IN TUTION!!<br />IT WORKS, IT WORKS, IT WORKS, IT WORKS, IT WORKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Now the last bit. It was my dream to meet a Nobel Prize winner; I accomplished that.  Further, I am about to spend the rest of my life with an amazing partner I attracted, am leaner and healthier than I have been in years, have traveled to so many wonderful locales, am about to close some amazing lucrative business deals.<br />Folks, from the bottom of my heart, I'll say this: I'm not special. Neither is anyone else who has written a review and testified to how their life has been changed.  Though I would love to, neither am I receiving any monetary compensation for recommending this book ( :) ).<br />The investment of a couple of dollars for this book is so cheap compared to the payoff.  You can change your life.  Even if you have $10,000,000 in the bank, a beautiful wife/husband, are in perfect health, etc., if there is ONE area in your life that just won't budge, you just can't seem to get it right, this book will provide the solution.<br />I am making a life commitment to giving all of the special people I know this book.  Unfortunately, most people will probably never see their lives changed through the truths presented here.  YOU CAN BE DIFFERENT.  Break through mass hypnosis, negative thinking, and those thieves of lack, limitation, worry, doubt, loss, fear and anxiety that rob people of their highest potential and of living the life of their wildest dreams.  The Universe wants you happy!  You deserve to be happy.<br />God knows, I pray that everyone reading this post gets this book, applies the principles and sees their lives changed.  The only thing that I ask (and I'm sure Dr. Murphy would to) is that you pass on the good word.  You don't have to buy the book to do this--eternal truths are eternal truths.

B000000H5J|5.0|Fear Factory was one of the first \\"serious metal\\" bands I ever heard, and it was a good place to start, because they are also among the best.  \\"Demanufacture\\" is one of the most revered metal albums of the 90's, and it's easy to see why.  The album is packed with crushing, thrash-inspired riffs that continue the tradition of bands like Slayer, Pantera, Metallica, etc.  But Fear Factory are not just rehashing the sounds of those bands, not in the least.  They are one of the most original bands in the genre, and their innovation is just as evident as their ability to make your head bang.<br />The album starts off with the title track, beginning with frontman Burton C. Bell singing softly over a thrashy industrial riff, finally elevating into a brutal growl.  In this one song, we get a glimpse of the extent of Bell's amazing versatility.  He can sing in a unique, ethereal voice, and switch to unbridled aggression in the blink of an eye.  \\"Self Bias Resistor\\" is further proof of his vocal ability, featuring an excellent melodic chorus to contrast with the overall heaviness of the song.  Likewise, electronic keyboard sounds underscore the crushing riffage, adding unique flavor to the familiar metal-isms.<br />From here, the greatness is nearly nonstop.  \\"Zero Signal\\" begins with an eerie, ambient intro, finally erupting into ferocity by the end.  \\"Replica\\" and \\"Body Hammer\\" are crunchy groove-monsters, while \\"New Breed\\" and \\"HK (Hunter-Killer)\\" are fast and relentless.  The album is propelled by Dino's machine-gun-like rhythms, and Ray Herrera's pounding drums.  Both are accused of being \\"simple\\" musicians, due in large part to Ray's lack of conventional fills, and Dino's lack of shredding solos.  However, both are undeniably skilled.  Listen to Dino's jackhammer of a right hand, or Ray's impeccable double bass control, and you'll see what I mean.<br />The album ends on an unexpectedly soft note, with the incredible 9-minute \\"A Therapy for Pain\\".  The song is uniformly slow and moody, with overwhelming ambience and beauty.  The guitars and keys lay down a huge, encompassing backdrop, and Burton's vocals are just unreal.  The song gives the feel of being surrounded by a dark, cold, futuristic setting (think \\"The Matrix\\", minus Keanu Reeves).  Maybe I say this a lot, but this is one of those songs that you just have to hear for yourself.<br />Despite all of the things that make this album so incredible, there are a few small shortcomings.  The cover track \\"Dog Day Sunrise\\" is glaringly weak, as compared to the rest.  It's not really bad, per se, but amid all the other great songs, it definitely stands out.  Even if you aren't aware that it's a cover, it still feels as though it shouldn't be there.  Also, the production is a little weak.  Burton's vocals feel a little too pushed back in the mix, and they don't pack quite the punch that they should.  On the follow-up release, \\"Obsolete\\", the growls just hit you like a freight train, and here the music almost drowns them out at times.  But that's a minor complaint.  It's really not that distracting for the most part.<br />Anyway, the important thing is this:  \\"Demanufacture\\" is a masterpiece of metal, with few flaws.  If you love music that's equally heavy and creative, you have no excuse not to have this in your collection.  Buy it, or forever be unmetal.slow and moody, with overwhelming ambience and beauty.

B000002UB3|5.0|The Beatles had one of the greatest careers I can think of. They first premiered on the Ed Sullivan show and the fans went wild. Then, their first few albums all did well. Their fifth UK release Help!(see review) was critically praised and hit #1 on the charts. Their followup Rubber Soul(see review), sold well too and hit #1. Then they released the masterwork Revolver(see review) which, like every disc before it, practically hit #1 with a bullet. The follow-up, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band(see review), is arguably the greatest rock and roll album in history and was praised and hit #1 without a single(something those jokers Turdran Turdran could not ever accomplish). Then, they issued Magical Mystery Tour(see review) in December of 1967, which also hit #1. In 1968, they went to India, hung out with Mia Farrow, and released their self-titled double effort nicknamed The White Album(see review) which, just like always, hit #1. By this time, the Beatles' career was musically on top of its game but tensions were increasing(death of manager Brian Epstein, the greedy Allen Klein coming in and so forth). In 1969, they recorded Let it Be(but was not released until after the breakup in 1970 but did hit #1). Also, that same year, John married Yoko Ono and Paul married Linda. Finally, the Fab Four recorded and released their farewell disc Abbey Road that October. This album, like all the ones before it hit #1 with a bullet(only to be dislodged by Led Zeppelin II) and they disbanded on top of the musical empire in 1970. This album is a classic with songs like Lennon's Come Together, I Want You She's So Heavy, Ringo's Octopus' Garden, Geogre Harrison's Here Comes the Sun and Something, Paul McCartney's Maxwell's Silver Hammer, Oh! Darling and the Golden Slumbers medley which are all memorable. This was no better way for a group to bow out gracefully, on top, like The Beatles did!
B00007GZR5|5.0|I am shocked and astonished to hear so many critics complain about such an amazing movie!! I don't know maybe it's because there's so many religious people out there that were appauled by something different like life after death, but who really knows it was just a movie and a very compelling one at that. If people who just be open minded and watch the movie w/out reservations they would see a beautiful movie with fantastic acting and wonderful special effects, the movie will take you  reeling on a roller coaster ride of emotions. Open up take in all it's beauty and superb acting than you will see one of the most incredible movies of our time. It did not get the recognition it desirved and I believe that has a lot to do with the whole religion aspect. For those of us with a fear of dieing this just gives us a little something to hope for in the after life. I've never had a movie truely move like this one. So all you skeptics open your mind a little bit and let this movie in, because it truely is beautiful!!!!!

0195067142|5.0|This book takes war for all it is. War is brutal and Sledge does not hide any of it. He brings the war to you clearly and plainly. He is not an author, he is a writer simply writing about what he say, felt, and experienced. After reading this book there is no way you will not have a whole new appreciation for &quot;The Big Red One&quot; and all military units. This is the best book recounting WWII out there. It has a clarity and honesty that no reporter could get, this book is from a front line solider and shows what he saw. Absolutely superb.
B000002UAO|5.0|The Beatles' sixth British album Rubber Soul is a masterpiece. The original US version was kind of a rip-off but the UK version was the real album in my view. The blending of acoustic guitars with rock and roll works here. Rhythm guitarist John Lennon rocks with Drive My Car, Wait, The Word and the acoustic tinged Run For Your Life but in between, he showcases his more acoustic side with the excellent Norwegian Wood(with lead guitarist George Harrison's excellent sitar work and to the one star reviewer, sitars do work in rock and roll and tell that to The Stones) and Girl and the ballad In My Life(recently covered by the late great Johnny Cash on his farewell album). Bassist Paul McCartney's contributions are the melodic You Won't See Me and the ballad Michelle and the fast acoustic rocker I'm Looking Through You. George Harrison contributes his best songs up to this point with Think For Yourself and If I Needed Someone which both have great guitar playing by the Quiet Beatle. George, John and Paul showcase their beautiful harmonies on Nowhere Man which is arguably the album's best track. Ringo Starr sings What Goes On showing that he was one of few drummers in rock history who could sing and play drums simultaneously. I discovered this album on the radio in 1987 when the Beatles CDs came out and were playing them in their entirety on the radio station. Highly recommended!
0385504209|5.0|What I found fascinating about the extremely critical reviews of the book was not so much what they criticized, but what they avoided criticizing.  They tended to pick apart history and things about which historians continually wrangle anyway.  One of Brown's key points had to do with Da Vinci's \\"Last Supper.\\"  He claimed there were a variety of things in the painting.  For instance, sitting on Christ's right hand was a woman, not a disciple.  He also pointed out that there is an unknown hand in the painting, holding a dagger.  Go find a good net shot of the restored painting.  Don't take my word...or Brown's...for it.  We've always been told Jesus and 12 disciples.  It's not true.  I did not get that all Catholics were bad, nor that the Catholic Church is.  But can anyone say that the Catholic Church has not committed incredible atrocities and tortures in it's history?  And has amassed one of the greatest \\"hidden\\" fortunes anywhere in the world?  These things are a matter of record.  And can anyone seriously say the Catholic religion has not made sex - except in their strict interpretation - a huge sin?  And has not the power of the feminine been suppressed for 2000 years?  If not, where are the women bishops? Popes?  Women in high positions in the church?  This is reality, kids.  On these points, alone, the book is worth a long read.
B00014K5TQ|4.0|Goood movie. It got trashed by most reviewers, but aside from the completely made up parts, it was a pretty cool portrayal of the real events. Gitsie and michael were NEVER lovers. Michael was completely gay. Also you get the feeling they crammed 10 years into a few months. Christina was long dead by the time angel came into the scene. There also were the obvious club kids missing. Lahoma and Jennytalia were both interviewed in the documentary and Jennytalia in particular was a huge part of the book, yet both are mysteriously absent from the film. Seth Green had James's mannerisms down pat and in particular, his laugh. He does an incredible job of playing James. Wilmer Valderrama is drop dead gorgeous. I wish we could have seen \\"more\\" of him, LoL. Culkin brought a human side to Michael never seen before, although you still get the feeling it's Macaulay Culkin playing Michael Alig. The addition of real club kids like Amanda Lepore and Richie Rich added authenticity to the film, although I wish they would have gotten at least a few lines. Overall, I recommend reading the book or seeing the shockumentary first, as they are more accurate depictions of the story, although I still highly recommend the movie. Also to \\"get into it\\", you would probably need to be a girly girl or a gay guy as I am.
B00008H2LB|5.0|I can't stand to see Trolls like Batista and A Music Fan from Earth bash Linkin Park with their worthless opinions.  I'm writing this review because I'm a fan of music and don't base an artists' worth by their success...underground or mainstream.  With that said I'm going to make this short- LP has stuck to their sound and it works great.  The lyrics are easy to relate to given the situation, and when you're not in that mood the harmony is very good when played at high volume.  Sometimes simplicity is beauty...look at how green day rose to the top with only a handful of riffs.  Obviously you're thinking about buying this CD; if you Like Linkin Park then buy it.  I listen to everything from hip-hop, electronic, alternative, rock, metal and even blissful stuff like Sigur Ros.  If you're not a fan, download a few songs and have a listen; don't take my word for it.
B000002UAO|5.0|The albums that preceded Rubber soul were brilliant in their own way but, to most people, were just the starters for what followed. This album is different from their earlier music but not radically so - it has more in common with its predecessors than it does with what came after.<br />In those days, singles were usually left off albums, it being assumed that anybody interested in buying the album already had the singles. Therefore, this album contains none of the Beatles' own hits, yet it contains many well-known songs, thanks partly to a welter of cover versions.<br />Among the classic songs are Drive my car (covered by David Crosby among others), Norwegian wood (there are many covers of this but I particularly like the one by Hank Williams Junior), You won't see me (superbly covered by Anne Murray), Nowhere man (my favorite cover version of this is Vikki Carr's), Michelle (a British number one hit for the Overlanders - the only UK hit they ever had), Girl (an outstanding song but rarely covered), I'm looking through you (brilliantly covered by Steve Earle), In my life (frequently covered, notably by Bette Midler) and If I needed someone (a hit for the Hollies). Outstanding though some of the covers are, there is no substitute for the original versions.<br />This no-hits album is far superior to most greatest hits packages and is definitely one of the Beatles' best albums.
0385504209|5.0|Since there are many reviews on this book, I will not get into the plot. Of course, it is an intense one with lots of rapid page turning. The main thing I got from this book is how our world has lost touch with the feminine side. Not to say that it is completely gone yet it is definately not balanced with the masculine. Look at the world and see how the masculine energy is expressing itself. The book seems to stress a need for balance in ourselves and the world in general. This was what I think the main issue was, at least for me. The arts are they really that or a commercial venture that is about money? I don't think its all like that, yet it is definately not balanced. Is technology being balanced with the art in schools, in general. Well the book didn't get into this conflict yet I could see how the feminine energy is out of sink with the masculine in these areas as well as other areas. I am grateful to have a deeper awareness of this after reading Dan Brown's book. I truly believe that the reason it is such a hit is because it is really triggering us on not just a conscious level.<br />Lisa Nary
B00000I8UF|5.0|This album is considered a bop standard for good reason.  It features Benny Golson, Lee Morgan and Bobby Timmons, so it's an all-star cast of fine bop players. <br />I absolutely love the title track.  The album also shows some great, solo drum work on a few songs, which is quite hard to find. <br />It's downright head-bobbing at times.  This is very upbeat and easy to dig.  <br />Obviously this is recommended to all jazz fans.  But this is quite accessible, so I would also recommend this (or Blue Note's Best of Art Blakey) to people who don't know a whole lot about jazz but would like to learn.
0156027321|5.0|Impressive story and philosophy.<br />It's &quot;a story that will make you believe in God&quot;, and this is enough to read it.<br />The expression of Martel is so simple and beautiful; I was crying in hiccups in one chapter and it was only a dream in the story.. and I've really felt the smell of fresh fish while reading this book!.. It was so realistic.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Slick, well-written, and funny, Firefly's first season stands well on its own.  Although it's got a lot in common with &quot;Cowboy Beebop&quot; (including fantastic original music--Fox is considering a soundtrack release), such as a culture in which Chinese is the dominant language, it reaches deeper into its world and its characters.<br />I've bought the DVD for my friends and family, and everyone has loved it--even those who normally don't care for sci fi.  We even watched all the episodes through again with the commentary--that, and the featurette were actually really entertaining.<br />This DVD won't disappoint.  The only complaint I've got back from my friends is that they want more...

B000002KIK|5.0|Sabbath's last studio album w/ Ozzy and the end of genius. This album can be summed up as majestic, emotional, and inspiring. If you like Sabbath you will love this album. Sabbath never compromised their integrity and this album is testament to that. If you are looking for another Paranoid or Master of Reality, you will be disappointed. But the songwriting on this album stands up to any record Sabbath made.
0385504209|4.0|I read this book in a week, it's pretty thick but after the first chapter you're hooked. The writing isn't excellent but Dan Brown sure knows how to set you up for suspense and excitement. At points I couldn't believe the amount of research that must have gone into writing this book. All of the theories were obviously fiction but the weird part was that they actually made sense. I loved this book! I have already read &quot;Angels &amp; Demons&quot; another of Dan Brown's books and Da Vinci Code is by far the better of the two. Buy it you'll love it!

B00005JMJ4|5.0|I am writing this review mostly in response to those who say it is boring and pointless.  Frankly, if a movie-watcher is looking for car crashes, watch Speed.  Lost in Translation is a movie that I might describe as &quot;dreamlike realism.&quot;  It is a quiet film set in a noisy city.  <br />Bill Murray plays a '70s action movie star who is Tokyo to film a commercial for whiskey.  In the early film, he undergoes an experience not unlike sensory deprivation.  He drinks alone in a bar listening to bad karaoke.  His commercial director speaks for twenty animated seconds and his translator gives him three words of meaningless direction.  He is an ocean away from a family that has forgotten him.  He is numb.  He is alone.<br />Scarlett Johansson plays the young wife of a hipster photographer who is forced to stay in the hotel during her husband's photo shoots around the country.  She listens to self-help tapes in her hotel room.  She swims alone in the large hotel pool.<br />The film is about how these two souls that are floating aimlessly and blindly in our ultra-modern world connect in a way we don't usually see on film.  Even though they must be at least thirty years apart in age (a fact the director Sofia Coppola uses to accent the improbability of the events), they form a bond that begins perhaps because they understand each other's pain.  But how it develops is what makes this movie so special.<br />In a world where all of us probably feel alone in some way despite all the technology that connects us and supposedly makes our lives easier, we can root for these two lost souls to find each other and with that, find happiness.<br />The cinematography and the direction is breathtaking also.  The scenes are never rushed, and, along with the ethereal music, this gives the film its dreamlike quality.  The scene where Scarlett Johansson's character takes a sightseeing trip by herself was an especially powerful one for me.<br />Overall, I can't say enough good things about this film.  It was the best movie I've seen in a long time.  Just don't watch it expecting Guy Ritchie to have done the editing and the Wachowski brothers to have choreographed the fight scenes.
B00009L1TA|2.0|This flick was so convoluted and ultra-contrived that I have to think the only purpose the director had in mind was to totally confuse and deceive the viewer into a narcoleptic trance. Absolutely devoid of flow, and even though the action sequences are bearable, after the third or fourth flashback- you just find yourself thinking what else is there I could be watching instead.

B00005MKA1|5.0|This is one of Bob's greatest works.  Although it is different than other works such as Burnin, Catch a Fire, and Rastaman Vibration, it is still great.  Its very upbeat and speaks HIGHly of the world's greatest herb.  A lot of people hate on this album because its such an upbeat album, but it is a must have for any Bob Marley fan.
B00000JMP9|5.0|When I first saw this 1980's film it was as a short clip on the television channel Classic Arts Showcase, which runs 24 hrs a day and is free of charge on cable. I was breathtaken. The scene was Werther and Charlotte's encounter at the Covent (at least it looked like the interior of a convent). They sing a duet together and the music swells dramatically, as does their voices, ending climatically as they fall into each other's arms. Never before have I seen more passion in any opera, or in real life for that matter. This is a reason why lots of hopeless romantics flock to the opera. The opera is romantic. In the case of this DVD, we find the singers in top form and enough room in the film to act. They are reminiscent of the Rosi &quot;Carmen&quot; starring Placido Domingo and Julia Migenes Johnson as Don Jose and Carmen. Birgitte Fassbaender, formerly a mezzo soprano, takes on the lyric and dramatic role of Charlotte who struggles with feelings of love versus duty. Peter Dvorsky as the tenor hero Werther is absolutely the best. His voice and dramatic performance conveys the right depth and ardor. Jules Massenet drew this story from the novel &quot;The Sorrows Of Young Werther&quot; a quintessentially romantic plot in its day. Massenet knew that putting this story to opera would allow him to compose music that requires all the Romantic Era conventions- fate motifs, romantic melodies and idylls, dramatic conflict, crescendo, pumped-up orchestra and hushed pianissimo. Werther, madly in love with Charlotte, is driven to suicide because Charlotte decides to foresake his love. Suicide was a common theme in 19th century Romantic literature, plays and opera. Ophelia's Suicide in Hamlet was a darling of the day, as was the double suicides of Romeo and Juliet. Intense passions, romantic tragedy, thwarted love, beautiful scenery and excellent music makes this film one of the best.
B00008PX8P|5.0|Don't listen to these little ignorant people that say this dvd sucks. They obviously listen to that horrible rap ****. I haven't been around to appriciate Zeppelin back in the day, but I'm glad I found out about them. Their music is so beautiful and inspiring. Nobody can not listen to Kashmir or Stairway to Heaven and not like it. Every single song on this DVD is amazing. The picture quality is great, despite what that moron Pure Garbage said. Do yourself a favor and buy this dvd. It will redefine what you think of music.<br />p.s to all the morons who bash us for listining to actual music, bite us, we at least know what real music is
B000094J5T|5.0|--This film recreates the survival of a brilliant concert pianist who is subjected to the terrors of Nazi occupation.  That survival depended on his own wits, a great deal of luck, the kindness of many benefactors, and even the compassion of an enemy officer. The director indicates survival is tenuous, and depends on the attitude of the survivor -- one moment's lapse of concentration or effort, and all could be over -- and on the environment -- one false or unlucky step, and all could be over.<br />--Unlike many Holocaust films, this one moves quickly from one scene to another without overdwelling -- Polanski shoots, makes his point, and then moves on quickly, which allows the movie to avoid being emotionally mawkish and overdone (although it also makes it harder to develop depth of character).<br />--I saw this film with a person who normally despises and avoids violent documentaries, and neither of us felt Polanski tried to glorify violence for the sake of gaining an audience.  Therefore, we felt far less offended by the violence than in a typical Hollywood film.  It also made us count our blessings!<br />--I would recommend it to anyone interested in the phenomenon of survivorship or who just wants to see a positive, thoughtful, and decent movie.
B00000F14B|4.0|A film by Morton DeCosta<br />\\"The Music Man\\" has the feel of a traditional music.  What I mean is that it fits the stereotypical movie musical: a little cheesy, characters ready to burst into song and dance at any moment, and with backgrounds that look like they were painted in.  Despite that, or perhaps because of it, \\"The Music Man\\" works.<br />The premise of \\"The Music Man\\" is that a traveling salesman, Harold Hill (Robert Preston) comes to River City, Iowa with the intent to con the town into buying instruments and uniforms to form a boys marching band.  Harold Hill just has to convince the town that they both need and want a marching band.  He begins to win over the town, despite not having any musical ability, and has nearly everyone conned except for the librarian, Marian (Shirley Jones).  To win her, he tries to woo her.  He is incredibly charming and smooth, but it isn't until the kids begin being excited about music that Marian even begins to crack.<br />There are some very good songs in this musical.  \\"76 Trombones\\" is a classic, but my favorite was \\"Marian the Librarian\\".  There is a certain amount of sweetness and nostalgia to this movie.  It is definitely an old time movie that the whole family can watch together.  The one thing that surprised me the most was a young Ron Howard was in this movie (he was the kid with the lisp).  I can't say that this is one of my favorite movies, but this was a good musical and a good movie and it is family friendly.

1577311523|5.0|I read \\"The Power of Now\\" in 2002 and it changed my life and my way of thinking.  It taught me that to really be part of life and living is to live in the moment.  Living in the moment brought me in touch with the beauty that exists in the world instead of the noise in my head.  Connecting with the beauty in the world showed me that there is indeed a God and that if I choose to live in the moment I too would some day be living a life of beauty.  I took this message very seriously and now two years later, I see the manifestation and the transformation that has occured in my life simply by choosing to live in the moment.  I took in this book one paragraph at a time in order to really understand it and even though it took me several months to finally make it to the last page, it was well worth it!
B0000793Z9|5.0|This is a fine, fine recording of very different music. One of the things other reviewers haven't noted is the spiritual (and dare I say it evangelical) note of Jim's singing. He and Bono both came from a direction which in the US would have been called Christian Rock, but without the pigeonhole baggage US groups carried. He is so emotional in trying to deliver the lyric it is almost a collection of songs without words. You do not have even adequate coverage of the very, very best of 80's music without this CD, Sparkle In The Rain and Sons and Fascination. And the answer to &quot;Why Didn't They Stay This Great?&quot; is: Jim had his soul stolen by the greatest Alpha female rocker of all time, Chryssie Hynde. After her, he was never the same. Would you be any different?
B00018D44U|3.0|I liked the jazziness of the first album. This is a bit folky and country for my taste. Of course she has a beautiful voice and it's a nice background music cd to have on.

0142437611|5.0|I generally agree with what the other reviewers say about this book, though I'm not sure they appreciate the level of sympathy, and even love, Bellow has for his flawed creation (and Bellow's warmth is one of many things I love about him).  I would add that this book is the best introduction to Bellow's work.  Like Herzog and The Adventures of Augie March it is unarguably a classic of twentieth century literature; unlike them it's short and relatively straightforward, and once you see what the man can accomplish in a mere 115 pages you'll definitely be primed for more.
0385504209|5.0|first point--conspiracy theories can never be trusted fully.  second point, there's merit in disturbing what seems true--the fact that authority cannot be trusted wholeheartedly is a progressive attempt and is thus 'good.'  ultimately it's a question of faith as to what you believe and what you not.  contrary to common perception, faith is irrelevant to truth.  in fact most liberals will argue that truth does not matter, b/c they can easily be manipulated.  that said, the review clearly is inconclusive.  the fact that phi (1.618:1) exists in nature is a general phenomenon not a sample path by sample path specificity.  and if it so happens that that reader did not have the desired measurement of the golden ratio, it only suggests that his/her body is not what we will call 'pretty.' =) and as far as the suggested reading list goes, that list only contains one side of the story--the authentic history--whose validity was the central point of dispute in the novel and thus shall not be counted as conclusive evidence against that which is presented in the da vinci code.
B00006SFBD|5.0|Opeth Rocks! I just saw them live yesterday night and I still cannot get over the buzz they created for us. They really rocked the concert with Kick ass tunes like Deliverance, Masters apperentice, In my time of need, etc....They were so heavy and at the same time could be very smooth and mellow. This album is a must for anyone. I dont want to get into details of this album, but its not your regular cookie monster type of music. It switches between ambient soothing sounds to devil driven vocals within a blink of an eye. If you get a chance, watch them live.     Highlight of this album: Master's Apperentice
B0000AQS0F|5.0|&quot;Firefly&quot; is a great story - full of interesting characters, good plotlines,  and subtle humor.  I saw the series when it was aired in the UK, and I was really disappointed that it was cancelled.<br />I bought the DVDs from the US and had them shipped to my home in the UK,  and I have foundmyself watching them several times... and I find it impossible to restrict myself to just one episode at a time.<br />There is a really good balance between stories, characterization and sci fi.  It's not your traditional sci fi tale.  Yes, it takes place 500 years in the future, on other planets and on spaceships....  but that is about it.  There's no alien species,  no beaming,  no magic warp drive.<br />I've also seen it refered to as &quot;Western&quot;.  Ye-es, on some planets they ride horses,  and in one episode there is a kind of westernish plot...  but other than that it didn't really come across that way to me.<br />And despite being created by Joss Whedon,  it's not like Angel or Buffy,  except in the subtle humor department.<br />I seem to have spent most of this review telling you what it isn't, so I'll now try to tell you what it is.  It's so damn original it defies classification.<br />It's...fantastic.  Interesting. COmpulsive. Gripping. Laugh out loud funny.  I-can't-look-scary.  Addictive.  <br />Even without the great special features, it's an absolute bargain.<br />C'mon. Its only 35 bucks. Having watched all the episodes, and the special features I'd have to say I'd pay twice that.<br />My husband - who wasn't interested when it was on TV - has similarly become addicted,  which surprised me as he isn't really a Joss Whedon fan.

B000002B2T|5.0|There is no question that Layne Staley had his personal demons. Anyone who has listened to Alice in Chains knows that, and unfortunately he lost that battle with his untimely death. Mad Season was formed as a supergroup featuring members of AiC, Pearl Jam and the Screaming Trees, and they have created something that is completely unexpected. &quot;Above&quot; is a quiet, introspective, solemn album, filled with beautiful songs, light melodies and soulful lyrics. Maybe this album was a way for Staley to deal with wihis demons in a less aggresive fashion, and it comes across wonderfully. <br />This is a good album from start to finish, and the best songs are &quot;Wake Up&quot;, &quot;River of Deceit&quot; and &quot;Artificial Red&quot;. This is not to say that there are any weaker songs here, because all ten of them are very good. This is the perfect album to buy now for those fans of grunge who have mellowed as the years have gone by, but still miss the intensity of the music that was being produced in Seattle during the nineties. <br />As much as I love Alice in Chains, I would have to say that this is the best work that Layne has done, showing that his talent was truly limitless. &quot;Above&quot; is a great disc, and a must-have for fans of any of the bands that have come together to create this masterpiece.
B0000AFQS0|5.0|I first saw TKAA in 1982, and Townsend sliding across the stage during &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; during one of the best screams in rock and roll was worth the price of admission alone. (I wasn't really even a Who fan until &quot;Who's Next,&quot; which is one of my Top 20 rock albums of all time.) This documentary illustrates why/how the Who became one of the most powerful and popular bands of the 60's and 70's. Brilliant songrwriting with a steamroller deliverance. The audio, especially during the staged and live recorded &quot;Baba O'Reily&quot; and &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; is fantastic. Current bands only wish they could sound this good and powerful. The selectable camera angles and the ability to isolate Entwistle's bass tracks on the bonus disc is a nice addition. John's lines on &quot;Won't Get Fooled Again&quot; are nothing short of thunderous. And how can you not love a drummer with headphones duct-taped to his head? Keith Moon is just fun to watch, and you can select the camera that filmed him for the entire performance. <BR>Even though I don't particularly care for the older stuff, much prefering the heavier Who of the 70's, this two-disc set is very enjoyable and well worth the price. Some of the early lip-syncing footage pales in comparison to the later bombastic performances, but it's great in its own right, even if just for historical purpose. But, on one negative note, this DVD set is so good that it makes me really miss the original Who lineup. At least we have this almost perfect time capsule.
B000003TA4|5.0|So much has been made about how &quot;Nevermind&quot; inspired a generation and started a musical revolution. But the simple fact of the matter is that it did exactly that. Nirvana took the forefront of the &quot;Whatever&quot; generation, and gave them something to be inspired about. Also, this album changed music, transforming it from its glossed over techno-pop back to the gritty core of what made rock and roll special in the first place. Kurt Cobain's lyrics may not make any sense, even to himself, but to people who had nothing else to care about, they meant the world. Nirvana's music was raw and tattered, rough around the edges and aggresive, but this album was exactly what was needed on the scene at the time. Alternative rock became the ultimate counterculture to what was taking place on the radio and MTV at the time, truly letting the world of rock turn the corner. And Nirvana happened to be the posterboys that started this musical revolution, as unlikely as they are, and as unwanted as this position was by Cobain. <br />The main problem with &quot;Nevermind&quot; is the production, which candy-coats the rawness that was Nirvana. For a better sound, the band stripped things down for &quot;In Utero&quot;, which has the pure savagery that &quot;Nevermind&quot; should have had. But this is not enough to stop this disc from being an absolute classic, one of the most important albums of all time. <br />There are several classic songs here, but I need not say anything more about the importance of a song like &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot;, a song whose opening chords still strike deep in an entire generation of lost souls at the time, who found a delicate solace in the anger of Nirvana. <br />Whether or not you like the band matters not, as it is undeniable that &quot;Nevermind&quot; rescued us from the hellish songs of Snap! and C+C Music Factory. Now all we are waiting for is another Kurt Cobain to rescue us from Britney, Christina and Justin.
B000002JOF|4.0|I'm glad someone pointed out that this is a concept album with all the songs integrated as part of the same story. I hadn't really thought about that before. I know this was a darker Chris Rea album, especially after the celebratory Dancing With Strangers. But I enjoyed the difference. There is still a lot of musical diversity on this album, which was to be diminished with later, more heavily blues albums.<BR>From the moody intro and brooding blues-rock of the title track, to the gentle appeal for a brighter day (Tell Me There's a Heaven), this is a strong, musically infectious album. In fact, both the opening and closing songs were included on Rea's &quot;Best of,&quot; but there were other singles from Road inexplicably left off greatest hits compilations. Both Daytona and That's What They Always Say were released as singles in South Africa with some success.
1573226521|5.0|Thousands of people every year throw all of their earthly possessions into a dirty backpack and hop onto a plane to end up in some magical destination where they can forget all of their troubles, and forget about their real lives. People go to Europe, or Australia, or the Far East to get lost and found all at the same time. And for most of these people, their only goal is do have the chance at doing something that nobody else has ever done before. <br />&quot;The Beach&quot; is the story of Richard, a disillussioned Brit headed for Thailand because travel really is an escape for him. Once there, he meets a strange man named Daffy Duck, who explains to him a story about a beach, completely protected from the ocean, where everything is perfect. Aware that he is hearing Eden described to him, Richard recruits his new French friends, Etienne and Francoise, to go on an adventure, and try to find this beach that is more legend than reality. The pace at which Alex Garland writes is similar to that of an adventure novel, and at face value, that is exactly how you could interpret &quot;The Beach&quot;. But it is more than that, and it seems to be much more to those who have travelled. <br />When the beach is found, it is a chance for everyone to start again, to create their own little world where there are not the usual problems. This is a utopia, surrounded by some of Mother Nature's best work, and some good people willing to make life on the beach possible. <br />Garland writes in many cultural references, including many quotes from &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; and endless references to Game Boy games. This gives the book enough touches of reality that there is a small part in your brain wondering if such a place could actually exist. <br />This novel is also a metaphor for modern society, building itself up before the inevitable desire to destroy itself takes over. We tear down the things we hold dearest, and this is a human charateristic that exists even in a perfect world, even on the beach. There are many themes here, including how far would you go to keep everything perfect, even when you know that things could never be the same. <br />Alex Garland has created a masterpiece in &quot;The Beach&quot;, and from experience, this book is a cult favorite among those who dare strap on the backpack and seek new adventure. An absolute must-read, there is something for everyone in this novel.
0385720920|2.0|I enjoyed &quot;Fight Club&quot; very much.  and I did enjoy most of &quot;Choke.&quot;<br />But style can only take you so far without narrative strength.  Choke ain't worth buying.
B00000JGHM|5.0|First off, I just want to express my appreciation for the quality script and cast that was put together for the making of this film. I can remember when this film first hit theaters back in late 1995. I also remember seeing the commercial a lot as well. However, you never heard or saw anything relating to this movie, until just recently. Now it is being played on TBS and F/X channels every other week. Well, it's about time! Most 'popular' and 'mainstream' movies only take about a year or 2 to reach commercial and constant airplay on television. Heat didn't hit 'cable' until a few years back. May I ask why??? Because nobody recognized or realized just how powerful and special this film really was. Everyone who took part in making this film..................can be seen today, 9 years later!, in current films and other outlets. So that has to account for something? Anyway, those of us who were excited about seeing the film back in 1995.........and took the time to notice and be entertained by this classic masterpiece............didn't have to wait almost 10 years to jump on the bandwagon, you know, the usual &quot;Yeah, that movie was great, after seeing it on 'TBS' for the first time, I knew it was a classic all these many years later&quot;. Even though HEAT will forever be my favorite movie of all time...........I wish the DVD would offer more features on it. I would pay top dollar to get the out-takes and other bonus materials that other DVD's usually offer as part of the set. So if you haven't taken the time to experience and enjoy this masterpiece(or weren't aware of its existence, like most people).................then you don't know what you are missing. If you would like to view and enjoy a film which offers a top notch cast and excellent story combined in this heart-pounding, sophisticated, clever, saga then by all means, check this one out. There will never be another movie of this caliber made ever again. As I said earlier, it is about time HEAT is getting some attention and respect. It's just a shame that it took almost a whole decade. Heat will always be top notch. This movie will always be my all time favorite, for as long as I live. Heat kicks A#@!!!
B00000DFTG|4.0|This live disc is so great. Sabbath plays all of the songs perfectly, probably cause they were all sober at the time. The tracklist is composed mostly of the songs from &quot;Black Sabbath,&quot; &quot;Paranoid,&quot; and &quot;Master of Reality,&quot; but there are some surprises. &quot;Dirty Women,&quot; &quot;Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath,&quot; &quot;A Spiral Architect,&quot; and of course the cocaine ballad &quot;Snowblind&quot; are all included. The two new tracks &quot;Psycho Man,&quot; and &quot;Selling My Soul&quot; are both decent. &quot;Psycho Man&quot; is kind of cheesy, but &quot;selling my soul&quot; isn't, which subsequently makes it the better of the two new tracks. However; &quot;Psycho Man&quot; is the only track that has all four members playing. &quot;Selling My Soul&quot; does not feature Bill Ward on drums. The only problem musically, is on &quot;Sabbath, Bloody Sabbath;&quot; the band doesn't perform the whole sludge part of the song before ending it( if you're a Sabbath fan, you know what part of the song I'm talking about). Anyways...this cd is sweet!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I read some of the critics reviews that said this idea of sci-fi meets western doesn't work.  It probably shouldn't work, but Firefly did succeed.  They were wrong.  I loved this show.  Actually, I bought this on a lark, without really knowing anything about it... just wanted to fill out my amazon order (I hate only getting like 2 or 3 things per order)--- then researched it.  I was ready to be disappointed.<BR>Also, when the show was on air a friend of mine at work told me about it and I poopoo'd the concept immediately.  Anyway, now I am glad I own the dvd collection and am sad it was cancelled so early.<br />Signed,<br />Repentant
B0000640SA|5.0|This movie is great. and yes the movie is backwords and in my opinion makes the movie all the better. as you can see, almost everyone that didn't like the movie didn't understand because they couldn't keep up with the movie. if you like a movie that makes you think this is the one for you. You have to go back in your mind and play out what happened 10 minutes ago. It's like playing jeopardy, you get the answer befor you get the question.   But if you like a movie where everything is layed out in front of you and tells you everything that is going on don't even bother. <BR>(there is an easter egg on the limited editon dvd where you can watch the movie in chronicalogical order)
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Iron Maiden has helped to shape the sounds of heavy metal since they formed in London, England in 1976.  With more than a dozen recorded albums, which include &quot;The Number of the Beast&quot; (1982), &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot; (1988) and &quot;Brave New World&quot; (2000), Iron Maiden's latest album, &quot;Dance of Death&quot; (2003), demonstrates how professional and dedicated these six men are in composing and performing solid, sophisticated, heavy and complex music. The eleven songs on &quot;Dance of Death&quot;, which total nearly 68 minutes of music, include unusual metering, changes in meter, key changes, compelling melodies, complex harmonies and vibrant vocals thanks to the band's six members: Steve Harris (bass, the band's founder), Bruce Dickinson (vocals), Dave Murray (guitar), Adrian Smith (guitar), Janick Gers (guitar) and Nicko McBrain (percussion).  My ranking (out of 5 stars) for each of the album's songs follow:<br />1. &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; (5+).  A fast and catchy song with very melodic &amp; intense choruses.<br />2. &quot;Rainmaker&quot; (5+).  Another fast &amp; catchy song with great chord changes and choruses.<br />3. &quot;No More Lies&quot; (5+). A complex &amp; melodic song that builds layer upon layer of sound, with meters in 2/4, 4/4 and 8/8 (as 1-2-3,1-2-3,1-2) in the chorus.<br />4. &quot;Monts&eacute;gur&quot; (4.5).  Heavy percussion, bass and guitar with intense vocals are featured in this intense, melodic song that features several key changes in the chorus.<br />5. &quot;Dance of Death&quot; (5+).  A melodic trio of guitars in 3/4 begins with increasing layers of sound, then smoothly transitions to 4/4 for most of the song.  It later transitions back to 3/4 for the last few measures.<br />6. &quot;Gates of Tomorrow&quot; (4.5). Fast staccato guitar begins this song before giving way to its melodic interior.<br />7. &quot;New Frontier&quot; (5).  A fast and heavy melodic song with several key changes.<br />8. &quot;Paschendale&quot; (5). Another very complex song with several changes in meter including 8/8 (as 1-2-3,1-2-3,1-2 and 1-2,1-2-3,1-2-3), 4/4 and 2/4.<br />9. &quot;Face in the Sand&quot; (5).  A ballad-like beginning in 3/4 increases in intensity as it switches to 6/8 time.<br />10. &quot;Age of Innocence&quot; (4.5).  A slower but intense beginning with unusual chords that increases in intensity and speed.<br />11. &quot;Journeyman&quot; (5+).  A very melodic ballad in 3/4 and 6/8 time.<br />Overall, I rate Iron Maiden's 2003 album &quot;Dance of Death&quot; with a very well deserved 5 out of 5 stars.  Even with several changes in lineup over the years, Iron Maiden continues to set the standard for great heavy metal. Whether you're a long-time Iron Maiden fan or not, I highly recommend that you check this album out.  You just might want to get it.e&quot; (5).

B0000AQVCL|5.0|I bought this CD a few days ago on a tip from a friend and can't stop playing it over and over! Imagine The Stones/The Who/The Kinks/Faces and a touch of Beatles all wrapped into one ...and you've got JET. Not only does the band ROCK, but with OUTSTANDING vocals, harmonies and melodies. It's the most refreshing sound that I've heard in a very long time. Can't wait to see them LIVE.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Simply the finest album ever produced by Radiohead, and perhaps one of the greatest albums to come around in a very, very long time. Although it may lack some of the mainstream appeal of their past works, such as \\"Ok Computer\\" or The Bends\\", it is an exciting and innovative album that follows more in the direction of their recent \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\". One can rightly say it begins where they left off, continuing to incorporate electronic elements with acoustic instruments. <br />What makes this such a incredible album is not only its originally and innovative style, but also that it is simply beautiful and powerful to experience. With this album Radiohead truly demonstrates that the hype that has so closely followed them in recent years has been greatly deserved, as they continue to establish themselves as the leaders the art-rock genre. I cannot ever recall an album having such a profound impression on me as did \\"Hail To The Thief\\".
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Ok, So I'm biased. I love space fiction and westerns. This<BR>is both in one of the most subtle mixes imaginable. <BR>Ron Glass I think summed up the experience for me in his <BR>interview on the DVD's I'm going to be thinking about how<BR>this series effected me for a long time. Wow...buy it Please<BR>please You won't regret it
B000002GYG|3.0|In &quot;Nighthawks at the Diner&quot; Tom Waits serves up the raw<BR>underbelly of society like scrambled eggs in a cool skillet.<BR>When I first heard this album I was immediately reminded <BR>of the 1950s beat poets of the lost generation. The despair,<BR>and desperation of harbored souls howls through the back<BR>alleys of desolation row. This is America the beautiful. <BR>The inevitable outcome of the Industrial Revolution.
B0000E6I1J|5.0|What can I say? Of all the piss-poor tribute albums that have been done (including Kiss' tip o' the hat to themselves w/ 'Kiss My Ass') this is the absolute greatest expression of appreciation for an artist's work ever. Honestly, not being a fan of Indian music I haven't listened all that much to disc 1 - Disc II however is f*cking amazing. <br />As Jim Morrison would say &quot;a feast of freinds&quot; are here to pay a long overdue albeit beautiful tribute to George. Jeff Lynne and Eric Clapton trick the listener sometimes into thinking they have the original songs on. Beautifully sung and played &quot;I Want To Tell You&quot; kicks off the disc and it goes all the way up from there. Tom Petty does his usual whine/sinus-nose singing of Taxman and the surviving Wilburys do a great job of Handle With Care. <br />Then it gets truly great. Ringo does Photograph in a voice that shows his love for his fallen comrade. The song takes on a meaning much more than a run-of-the-mill love song. With lyrics &quot;Ev'rytime I see your face it reminds me of the places we used to go - now all I got is a photograph and I realize you're not coming back anymore - I want you here to have &amp; hold&quot; perfectly sum up what all of the musicians and fans must have felt that evening. Truly remarkable.<br />The song that knocked me square on my ass was McCartney's version of Something. Having seen his tv concert, I knew he did a rendition of it on a ukelele. It begins as such, then when you least expect it - the whole band charges in as Eric Clapton nails the solo note for note with emotion not possible from anyone else in the biz. My cd skips now where that comes in 'cos I wore it out from being completely captivated. Just beautiful.<br />Clapton, Starr &amp; Paul wonderfully do While My Guitar Gently Weeps note for note and the rest of the cd follows in tow. <br />Truly if you're a fair-weather Beatle fan or a longtime Beatnut, then you will be amazed just how great this is for a manwho's talent was well-known but was always in the shadows of his obvious counterparts. On this, it's George's night. The once &quot;quiet one&quot; now speaks through his friends and the world once again has gained another great collection of music. <br />Pick it up!
0385510438|5.0|What probably throws most people off with this book (and I'm speaking of Grisham fans here) is that it isn't like anything else he's written.  &quot;A Painted House&quot; probably comes the closest, but even that's not a good comparison.<br />The wonderful thing about Grisham is that he's constantly growing and changing--refusing to get tied down to one style or get in some kind of a rut.  The problem with this is that his devoted readers want him to always be the same.  Tough situation.<br />But regardless of his style changes, he does remain constant in one way:  his books are all done well.  The characters are all believable and human, and his prose is finely crafted.  The story in &quot;The Last Juror&quot; isn't that shocking, but this is Grisham's attempt to blend his courtroom thrillers with his more &quot;literary&quot; attempts, and it works wonderfully.<br />Also recommended:  McCrae's &quot;Bark of the Dogwood&quot; and Conroy's &quot;Prince of Tides.&quot;
B00001U0DP|5.0|I congratulate Roberto Benigni for creating this movie. In &quot;Life is Beautiful&quot;, Benigni is teaching us a lesson about the Holocaust and life.  Granted Benigni's story is told in a different manner than other Holocaust films like &quot;Schindler's List&quot;. His style is rather light hearted, and I think some are offended to see such a serious matter portrayed as such.  But the lesson learned and the emotions you feel by the end of this movie are profound, and in no way take away from the seriousness of the Holocaust.<br />A final note, I personally think the Italian version is more authentic, as that is the native language of the actors.
006092988X|5.0|I've been singing the praises of the book (and movie) now for many years.  It's about time Oprah and everyone else realized what an American classic this is.  The story touched me long before I ever lived in Brooklyn, having moved there from the South. It's timeless and so beautifully crafted that you'd be more than a little off not to be moved by it.<br />I actually found the character of the mother more likeable in book than the movie.  She came off as a bit too hard and cold for me in the film, but then the policeman came off better in the movie than the book.  Both are great--don't get me wrong--but I always enjoy creating the characters in my mind, with the help of the author.  And in this case, it wasn't hard to do.<br />The movie often veers dangerously close to something sappy, but is pulled back just in time by a wonderful cast. I didn't experience these problems when reading the book, possibly because I wasn't forced into the pacing of the film.<br />At any rate, the style of writing of this book is excellent and the characters (even the tree!) will stay with you long after you've put it down.  Another reviewer was right: \\"They don't make 'em like this anymore.\\"<br />Also recommended:  McCrae's Bark of the Dogwood and Fall on Your Knees
B000005S0E|4.0|Released chronologically during the transition from the overwhelming darkness of Pornography that preceded it and the breakthrough catchy alt pop of Head on the Door that followed, The Top was bound to be a freaky album. If thats what you wanted it doesnt disappoint. Other than The Caterpillar, which ends the album, there are no clear singles.<br />The leadoff Shake Dog Shake may be the best song but doesnt fit into pop mold Ive ever heard. Piggy in the Mirror is a portrait of self-loathing that seems to fit Roberts mindset well. The Empty World is as bleak as the title implies with it death dirge military drum beat. Bananafishbones is a strange homage to J.D. Salingers short story A Perfect Day for Bananafish; Smith often wrote music with literature in mind using Andre Gide (How Beautiful You Are), Albert Camus (Killing An Arab) and others as source material. Many of the songs are good and creative. Give Me It stands out with its bursts of noise and horns and Robert wailing desperately like never before  Icing Sugar from Kiss Me seems like a reinterpretation of this song.<br />The Top may represent some of the groups most original work but is often less accessible than even its darker predecessors. Theres some weird stuff here, but worthwhile for fans and maybe adventurous listeners who arent Cure fanatics.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was just getting into the show when Fox cancelled it.  I bought the DVD and ever since, I have been addicted to it.  The stories and actors are excellent.  The dialogue is marvelous.  The humor is so slick.  I've now seen all the episodes multiple times, listened to all the commentaries multiple times, checked out the features multiple times and I continue to find it all a joy to watch.  This DVD box set is excellent!!!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I highly recommend this DVD.  The premise of this amazing series is captivating, intelligent and always entertaining as are the characters.  I really enjoyed the director's commentary.  It had me rolling on the floor.  I was so upset when F** canceled the series.  Now I can't help but watch the episodes over and over...
B000001FQQ|4.0|OK, after releasing a greatest hits album for the 80's generation, how to continue?  Released in 1989, Hot In The Shade yielded the group a Top Ten single, but a larger than usual number of songs (fifteen as opposed to the usual ten or eleven) and a lack of variation in songs makes this a good but not great album in their post-makeup era.<br />&quot;Betrayed&quot; mixes a harsh &quot;law of the jungle&quot; attitude and some cynical dismissal of self-pity-&quot;you ain't crucified, so get real&quot; and &quot;you ain't the only one who's been betrayed&quot; and an affirmation on not selling out.  All his songs here have this harsh, realist grabbing life by the throat and strangling it till one's dreams come true motif.<br />Paul's &quot;Hide Your Heart&quot; was co-written by Desmond Child and Holly Knight.  A tragic street gang love triangle is the story here, with a moral, something not usually present in KISS songs. Paul and Desmond also collaborate on &quot;You Love Me To Hate You&quot;<br />&quot;Prisoner Of Love&quot; co-written by Gene and Bruce, is sung by the former and benefits from the ferocity of Bruce's guitar.<br />With the rap in &quot;Read My Body,&quot; I detect a return to &quot;All Hell's Breaking Loose&quot; from Lick It Up, but with a power-intense sound like Def Leppard's &quot;Pour Some Sugar On Me.&quot;<br />I should've definitely followed Gene's advice in &quot;Love's A Slap In The Face,&quot; where the title and the chorus tell it like it is:  &quot;Sometimes love is like a slap in the face/you've been burned and it's the same old mistake/if you want my opinion I'll give it to you straight.&quot;  I bought this CD in 1990, why didn't I listen?  This is one of five songs co-written by Vini Poncia, who produced Dynasty and Unmasked for them.<br />The power ballad &quot;Forever,&quot; written by Paul and (gag!) Michael Bolton, became the group's first foray into the Top 40 since &quot;I Was Made For Lovin' You&quot; and second Top Ten hit.<br />&quot;Cadillac Dreams&quot; another Simmons-Poncia collaboration, is one of the most hard-driving songs here, and its focus being on money being the answer to dreams.  However, there is some of the scoring with girls motif here:  &quot;[she] checked into a one-room suite/the back seat of my car.&quot;  The horn arrangements were done by Paul.<br />Gene's &quot;Boomerang&quot; is another rapidfire drum and guitar attack reminiscent of &quot;No No No&quot; from Crazy Nights, also sung by Gene.<br />The rest of the album sports the same sound throughout with hardly any variation.  However, I've noticed a couple things.  In terms of lead vocals, the songs are evenly divided between 7 sung by Paul, 7 by Gene, and &quot;Little Caesar&quot; by Eric Carr, making me wonder if the equality in songs between the two had further meanings.  Another is the number of songwriters co-writing with them, including a name from their past.  And it looks like they're trying a mixed bag of winning and new formulas, production by Gene and Paul, ace songwriters, and bringing back a producer from the past.<br />Although a worthy release, in terms of being heavy, Hot In The Shade doesn't equal or rival their albums from Creatures up to Crazy Nights.  There is a degree of energy in it, and it starts out good, but the lack of variation from song to song and its lacking the aggression of Animalize or Asylum or the energy of Crazy Nights become debits.  Maybe less songs would've made it better, as this had possibilities.  This album also serves as Eric Carr's epitath, as he died of heart cancer in November 1991./>&quot;Cadillac Dreams&quot; another Simmons-Poncia collaboration, is one of the most hard-driving songs here, and its focus being on money being the answer to dreams.

0060527978|5.0|I believe in our soul there is a light given by God (or however you would like to call Him). That light is in our nature, in our soul, and given by instinct. That's why I don't believe one religion is right or wrong, christian, buddist, islamic... every religion is an interpretation of the light. No matter where you from, you will always have access to this light. I always believed this and I am so surprised when I read this book... everything I ever believed, is described so clearly. &quot;El Manual de los Guerreros de la luz&quot; has become my bible, it is not 'just' a companion for the alchemist. I'll give it 2,000 stars. By the way I never write a review about anything unless is important.
0553801546|4.0|I loved the Farseer trilogy.  I enjoyed the Liveship Traders.  I was disappointed by the end of this third trilogy.  It was so much less than it could have been.  After making such a huge deal over the friendship between FitzChivalry and the Fool, to have it end the way it did was frustrating.  Rather than exploring new horizons, Hobb seems to have taken the easy way out and tacked a &quot;happily ever after&quot; on the end.  I should probably mention that I never liked Molly's character, even in the Farseer trilogy, so her role in this final installment annoyed me no end.  At the conclusion of this book, I was not left with any sensation of &quot;Wow!  What an ending!&quot; but merely a &quot;Well, now I can stop worrying about it.&quot;  Hardly the response I expected.<br />Having said that, the book earns points for being well-written and finely crafted.  The ending, while not the one I would have chosen, did follow logically from the events of the story.  And perhaps it is a mark of how well developed Hobb's characters were that I cared so much about what happened to them.  So 4 stars for the series overall.
0451197968|5.0|WARNING: The following review contains spoilers!<br />Stephen King, in the '80s, was at the peak of his writing skill. Fresh out of University but scared that the public wouldn't appriciate his work, he wrote the classics It, Thinner, The Stand, among others, under the pseudonym of Richard Bachman. But ever since he gained status as a 'literary genius' - and changed his pen-name back to his native - he's been fumbling a bit, especially with his most recent works which have been total crap. But there's still his classics to contend with, one being The Running Man, which has been overlooked time and time again despite the fact having been turned into a movie with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Then again, the movie was garbage, so that's your knackered.<br />The novel takes place in the year 2027, in a Dystopian society where big business is everywhere, the air smells like a chain smoker 24/7, and television has become the leading medium. 'Free-Vees' are in every home, as eager audiences tune in every night to their favourite game show, of which there are many, produced by the evil Games Corporation. One such program is The Running Man, the most popular show for the company to date. Why you ask? The answer is simple: The contestants are middle-class citizens, who have been deemed 'deliquants' by the Games Commission after taking part in several apptitude tests. Once chosen, the contestant is let loose on the world, with one catch: They must survive 30 days without being killed by the Games Commission 'Hunters,' or complete strangers from off the street, who are paid exorbitant amounts of money to do so. If the contestant survives, they win a billion dollars. The record of survival in the six years the show has been on the air has been 8 days.<br />The new contestant on the show, Benjamin Richards, is a hard-case: A man who's been fired from almost every position he's ever held because of his firery attitude. His daughter is dying of peunomia, and signs up to be in one of theGames. His tests are some of the highest the Commission has ever seen, so they sign him up for The Running Man. He doesn't care - he has nothing to lose.<br />Along the way, Richards meets up with some strange personas, who may or may not be trying to help him win like he thinks... Some of them are: the producer of the show, the slimy Dan Killan; a woman he ends up taking hostage, Amelia Williams; and the Chief Hunter, Evan McCoy. So, he runs, and dodges, and runs some more, starting at the Games Building in Los Angeles, until the final confrontation at an airport in Newark, where Richards tries to escape from McCoy and his troupe, and must decide whether or not to sacrifice himself, or see if he can beat the survival record by just a few more minutes.<br />The Running Man is a great read, and a relatively short one too. King blends elements of social commentary, science-fiction, and action, all leading up to a shockingly violent set-piece, and quite an affecting and unexpected ending (A little hint: One of the main characters has his/her guts dragging behind him/her, literally! And one of the characters flies a jumbo jet into a building!). The novel seemed like a cross between George Orwell's 1984, the television show Fear Factor, and Oliver Stone's movie Natural Born Killers. If that's your sort of match-up, then The Running Man might just be your most overlooked novel of the decade.
B00008H2LB|1.0|These Nu-metal bands with there rappers/screamers, dj mixers and such I can't stand. Don't you people realize this is tearing apart rock n'roll, I mean please any rock band that comes out with a remix album is a disgrace. Linkin Park is part of the rap-metal evolution, posslibly the worst in music history. All these bands of this cadagory are fading away thank god, for example. Papa Roach,korn,Nickleback,Limp Bizkit,and P.O.D's last albums all flopped. Linkin Park is the only band hanging in there, but not for long. Luckily bands are coming out bringing back the sound of the old roots of rock n'roll. If your a Linkin Park fan and your saying that there oh so talented, then you don't know what your talking about, either you dont play an instrument or you do and your terrible because a two year old could play Linkin Parks guitar licks.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Witty Dialogue, and complex plots-- finally a show written for intelligent adults and not the same old mindless dribble that plagues television today.<BR>Loved the show-- shame it was cancelled.  Can't wait for the movie.<BR>Bought many sets of the DVD's for friends-- it's worth it!
B00018D44U|4.0|While I would still recommend the CD, be forewarned that it is 'copy controlled'; on some computer drives it would play with crackling sounds, on some others it would play just fine, and on some it would not play at all. This provided you prevent Autorun from running on Windows or Macs.<br />The 'enhanced' part is a misnomer. You get a (nice-looking, granted) media player that plays back encrypted WMA files corresponding to the audio tracks. Nothing like, say, Natalie Imbruglia's 'Smoke' single.
B00006DEFA|3.0|I have to agree with the review by ajofarc, this Director's cut is simply not as good as the Theatrical release that won all those Oscars and deserved critical acclaim. Most new scenes just add unnecessary length to the film, the nude scene is totally unnecessary and changes the tone of the film. The DVD picture quality over the previous flipper hasn't improved much, colour has been corrected but the image is still soft, lacking definition and is grainy. Sound quality is still relatively poor and has less bottom end than the previous release.<BR>Warner, please do this great film justice and release a fully restored theatrical DVD.
B0001906O0|5.0|I've had most of these songs, in one form or another already, as I am a huge Cure fan, and have been for years. I've collected these on cassette, LP, and CD singles since about 1985. What I didn't have was the reason for purchasing this set, as well as to have some truly brilliant songs (FINALLY!!!) on CD. The following songs are worth the price of the set alone: 10:15 Saturday Night, Plastic Passion, Pillbox Tales, I'm Cold, The Upstairs Room, The Exploding Boy (utterly fantastic!), A Few Hours After This, A Chain of Flowers, 2 Late (heartbreaking in a beautiful way), Halo, Scared As You, Ocean. Of course, there are other great songs, but these are some of Smith's best, and they were B sides! If you're a fan, BUY THIS NOW!!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|if you're readingthis review it probably means you're not quite sold on the idea of buying it yet, well let me tell you somthing you can stop worrying and procrastinating now because it's safe you can buy it and you wont be dissapointed infact you might even save your self some money because you will never have to buy another dvd again, you can just sit down and watch firefly over and over again. it has everything, grat characters played by great actors, it has some of the best dialogue I've ever heard, stunning special effects, action, romance the lot. buy it now love it, then come back and buy more copies for your friends and family
0553801546|4.0|I cried my eyes out! <br />This last book was wonderful. The book ties up every looose ends into a nice little knot. The story's pace is perfect: a good mix of action intertwined with passages filled with emotions and much more. I couldn't have asked for anything more. However, it clearly was not the ending I had wished for but, then again, this is a matter of personal preferences. Also, as great as the ending was for this particular serie, I was still left puzzled with one single thing concerning the Fool (due to my reading of the Liveship Traders trilogy). I won't say what it is, since I don't want to spoil anything, but it does bug me...<br />All in all, the book did not disappoint me! It is a must for anyone who faithfully followed the Fitz saga.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I didn't get it.  This movie received all this hype and I was excited to see it.  Boy was I disapointed, this movie had no point, no ending, no meaning.  The story is old man meets young girl, old man and young girl party, old man leaves.  That's it. Nothing happens. Save 2 hours of your life and pass on this movie.
B000068PQ0|5.0|This is a great cd. Not their best, but still better than most the stuff out there. This cd is a 5 star instead of four for one reason; &quot;Do You Realize&quot;. That is definitely the best single of the year, probably the best of the decade, and maybe the best of the history of pop music. The cd is worth buying for that song alone. The rest is great (namely Fight Test, and Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots pt 1 and 2), but some of it aint my cup of tea, like Ego Tripping at the Gates Of Hell and others like it. The lyrics, delivery and perfomance are great,but the type of music they play isnt my favorite. And sorry for not using big, pretentious (there we go) words.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Wilco never seems to falter. With every album they never cease to amaze my ears with intelligent, thoughtful lyrics and unusual melodies. Their sound is not only innovative, but it is also refreshing as well. Each song feels as if it is a cocktail of folk, rock, country, and alternative influences mixed with unique and sometimes offbeat background sound samples. &quot;Yankee Hotel Foxtrot&quot; delivers the essential Tweedy magic we all know and love, but also elaborates on it.<br />Before I listened to this record, I thought that &quot;Summerteeth&quot; was my favorite Wilco album. Now...I'm confused and not so sure. &quot;YHF&quot; has quickly caught up with it. The standout song for me is &quot;Ashes of American Flags.&quot; It is one of the more openly plaintively mellow tracks on the album, and I believe that is has a few of the best lines on the whole disc--&quot;All my lies are always wishes/I know I would die if I could come back new&quot;, as one example. Also, &quot;Jesus, Etc.&quot; is an excellent song--the instrumentals alone are exquisite, unexpected, and most certainly unique.<br />Probably my favorite thing about Wilco is Jeff Tweedy's incredible way of putting emotion into lyrics that are smart in ways unlike many other artists out there. The metaphors and mental images his words evoke are breaths of fresh modern air.<br />Where most bands from this generation continue to churn out dated shots at greatness, Wilco's albums have no timeline. Every album sounds as perfect as it did when released. Other bands seem to try to hard to be brilliant (if they even try). With Wilco, poetic statements in song just seem to flow naturally in cohesion with each other. I think that their albums are filled with music to live by or with or in that cannot be just merely &quot;listened&quot; to. They become a soundtrack to life, an extension of everyone's experience. Most songs of today don't even aspire to be so much.<br />I may be a little overzealous with my analyzation, but such excitement is warranted with this record.zation, but such excitement is warranted with this record.
B00013F38K|5.0|If he had he would know Carradines character was NOT full Chinese, that's the reason for a Chinese actor not playing the part. Secondly, I saw no discrimination in the episodes, no \\"white\\" people were portrayed as Chinese, instead Chinese actors were used and portrayed prominently in the series. Maybe people (jcc321) should watch the series instead of only writing what they think its about!!
B00003CXPJ|5.0|&quot;Zoolander&quot; is an odd movie, to say the very least. Everyone is used to seeing Ben Stiller playing his signature role as the awkward everyman who screws himself over time and time again, but rarely do we get to indulge in what he is really capable of. His best assets (in my opinion) are his formidable ability to create uproarious, fictitious characters as well as his deadon impersonations and parodies of well-known stars. Finally, we have a movie in which he can star in a leading role as one of his own creations.<br />What everyone needs to know before watching &quot;Zoolander&quot; is that it is not a like the Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson collaborations we've seen thus far. It is a blatant parody of itself and is in no way trying to be serious (I mean, &quot;Wake Me Up Before You Go-Go&quot; is the main theme, for god's sake). That's the beauty of it. The characters are larger than life in looks and personality, some parts are meant to be just plain cheese, and other parts are just freaky in a trippy, &quot;am I really watching this?&quot; sort of way.<br />The plot is as crazy as they come, but Zoolander still manages to pull it off. And some of the comedic moments (mostly from Ben) will have you rolling. For instance, the &quot;center for ants&quot; rant and his visit to the coal mines to see his father (Jon Voight)...when he says, &quot;I think I've got the black lung, pop&quot; how can you not laugh? His pathetic coughs alone are enough to kill me.<br />Overall, I think this movie is super. Owen Wilson as Zoolander's rival, Hansel, is great. And Will Ferrell, the freakish Mugatu, is hilarious as well.<br />BUT...I do have two qualms with the movie. The first being that Ben Stiller's real wife, Christine Taylor, is a major character. For one, she is a horrible actress and two...well, she is just a really bad actress. I don't know, maybe it's just the role. (I never saw &quot;The Brady Bunch Movie&quot;, so what do I know?) My second problem is Ben's father, Jerry Stiller, playing Zoolander's manager (Mr. Ballstein, I think). Don't get me wrong, I give kudos to Ben for including his whole family, and I love Jerry Stiller in Seinfeld, but I think that his peak ended with that show. He seems to only have one dynamic to his acting and his overwhelming persona just backfires all over the place. Besides that, some of his lines in the movie are just plain vulgar and seemed unnecessary--I really could've lived without hearing about his enlarged prostate.<br />I probably would give this movie 4.5 stars if I could, but I decided to round up. It definitely would get 5 stars if the family affair would have been left out. That's probably just my little ol' opinion, though. Check it out for yourself and enjoy!s father, Jerry Stiller, playing Zoolander's manager (Mr. Ballstein, I think).

B0000VAFO0|3.0|This film had a great trailer, and I've enjoyed Kate Beckinsale in other films, so I thought I'd give this a try. I was really disappointed. First, it's difficult to know who to root for: the Lycans are brutish but the vampires are decadent and duplicitous but dress better, both are violent. The film is gorgeous to look at, but by the end I really didn't care about any of these characters; there are elements from Matrix and Terminator and a dozen other thrillers here, but no one to care about -- sort of like a fantastic-looking Hammer film.<br /><br />Extras include trailers and a tv spot, storyboard comparison and a music video. The film can be heard in English or French with subtitles in English, French or Spanish. (We found the subtitles useful since it was often difficult to figure out what characters were saying.)
B00005JMGL|5.0|I took my 7-year old daughter to see this, expecting the usual re-make blahs.  What a surprise!  I loved it.  The acting, the production with terrific special effects, the unexpected humor (often aimed at adults) - it was a treat.  The kids were great, but Jason Isaacs shone as Hook.  I didn't see him in Harry Potter as others mentioned, but I remember his evil Col. Tavington in The Patriot with Mel Gibson - his Hook is very similar.  Can't wait for the DVD!
B00003CXXS|2.0|&quot;Computer geeks playing with their toys&quot; would be a good way to describe the plot of this film. In this age of rampant technology we're seeing more and more movies being made based upon the technology available. Plot is an afterthought - the focus is in finding ways to exploit new computer graphics.<br />The fact is, there was no reason for this film to be made. There is nothing in it that cannot be found in one of the first two films. I mean this literally, for in some cases actual &quot;plot&quot; lines were borrowed. The worst part about this film may be that its one redeeming quality - the effects - were actually poorer than the original which came out in '93. <br />The ridiculous unrealism that crept into &quot;The Lost World&quot; runs rampant in JP3, providing us with memorable scenes such as a cell phone's ring being heard through a giant dinosaur's body (he swallowed it), raptor's speaking to each other, Grant learning their language and communicating with them (why yes, I speak Raptonian...), and a kid who in a few weeks alone on the island has become a dinosaur and survival expert.<br />There is no reason whatsoever I can give to you to go see this film, especially if you've seen the first two. But, if JP4 comes out, maybe they'll give the raptors subtitles. I'd pay to see that.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Stay away, stay far away.  Nothing to see here (literally).
6305075492|5.0|I don't know why this film is criticised for its storyline. Maybe it is because of the persistent (but only possibly true) rumours that the &quot;twist&quot; at the end is the result of political pressures; or that it is a cop-out.<BR>I think &quot;The Cabine t of Doctor Caligari&quot; has been underrated. The plot of the film is no less amazing than the distorted sets for which it is famous. No matter where the final twist came from, it somehow fits perfectly into the fabric of the film, making it a journey into the ultimate &quot;cabine t&quot;, the mind of a madman.<BR>This disc (which is the same as the Force Videos/Eureka disc available in Australia&quot; is definitely worth the money. Reviewers who criticise this disc are often ignorant of the condition of the negative for this film. Yes, there is &quot;supposed&quot; to be a black line across the top of the screen; it was on the original negative (thank the original German company which screwed up when trying to find out where the top of the frame should end). Yes, there was tinting on the original film (most silent films had tinting; this restoration of the print is based on a tinted negative). <BR>There is, in fact, much to recommend about this restoration. The image, for a film that is eighty-five years old, is magnificent. The frame rate (a perilously low 16 frames per second) has been maintained; which, given my recent irritation with Abel Gance's &quot;Napoleon&quot;, is a real bonus.<BR>The soundtrack, by a certain Mr Brock, is about the best soundtrack for a silent film that I have heard. The string music in the expressionist-serialist style of Schoeberg and other composers of the period, drips with suitably expressionistic atmosphere.<BR>The alternative sountrack is a pretty good (though often dry) commentary by a film scholar. It is very interesting to hear his comments; such as, for instance, recent evidence casting doubt on the original oft-told story about why there is a twist at the end.<BR>On the extras there are some (startlingly modern) original advertising posters from America in 1920-1. Film advertising hasn't changed much - these posters, with some modifications, could have been used to promote &quot;Crouching Tiger&quot;, for instance.<BR>There are also photos of the original cinema where the film had its premiere - again, startlingly modern; I didn't know cinemas back then could be so plush.<BR>If I had anything bad to say about this disc, it would be that the intertitles, even though they are based on the original intertitles in German, are almost unbearably ugly. That, and the fact that the cover art in the Australian release is also unbearably ugly, with a typesetting error on the back...<br />I heartily recommend this disc for anyone with even a passing interest in silent film or expressionism.
B00005MAM2|1.0|This is my first review. I feel motivated to discourage people from buying this DVD. Akira has long been one of my favorite movies and I consider it a must see. It would be a good addition to any collection. However the voiceovers for this DVD have been changed as well as some of the lines, and it sucks. Akira fans will be very disappointed. Perhaps people who?ve never seen the movie won?t mind since they have no basis for comparison, but long time fans are sure to be disappointed.
B00014K5TQ|4.0|This movie is all glamour, drugs, attitude and murder. It's a dark comedy in my opinion. Seth Green turns in a winning performance as James St. James. Macaulay Culkin does alright as Michael Alig. I must admit I don't know the history of events involving the New York Club Kids. This movie is all I have to go on. I do plan to see the Shockumentary on the subject, if nothing else this movie inspired me to see more... For those that gave this film one star, Seth Green's performance is worth much more than that. Now for the disappointments involving the DVD. There are no chapters & no insert. So if you want to watch a certain scene you may have liked or want to skip around. Forget it. The only way to do so is by rewinding and fast fowarding. Party Monster on DVD brings back VCR standards. Remember \\"Mulholland Dr.\\" had no chapters either. What's the point? To whom it may concern.. STOP doing that, it's dumb. I expect my DVD's to come complete with hours of extras, chapters, an insert and what ever else you might be able to squeeze in. A free t-shirt would be nice.  ~Thanks
1577312082|4.0|I got the unabriged CDs of this book and found it entirely transforming. I really loved most of this book. It was as though Eckhart was speaking to me.  The only reason I give it 4 stars is there are a few things that I do not like about the book.  In some ways I believe he inadvertantly fuels some stereotypes. I will give one example to demostrate my point (paraphrasing): \\"... heterosexual men find it more difficult to experience enlightment than women and Gay men...or....\\"  That is a ignorant statement.  In someways it can be true because an ignorant person can be cut of from themselves but Not every heterosexual man is a beer guzzling, chest pounding idiot who would ignorately say this stuff is \\"for fags..\\" .   I am what one would consider extremely hetero: I enjoy football, lifting weights and at the same time enjoy spiritual teachings.  I just hate the stereotype that you cannot be in touch with yourself if you are a man.  It is pervasive and damaging.  Especially to young boys growing up...  Anyway.... All in all the positives from this book far outweigh the negatives.  Nothing is perfect.  But by not being perfect it is somehow perfect,  because really nothing is perfectable.  Bottom line: Buy it because I think anyone has the potential of learning a great deal from this book.<BR>Peace!
B00013RC9I|4.0|The chill-out gurus are back and at it again. The ones who delivered the soundtrack to Sophia Coppola's The Virgin Suicides took a dip after their colossal album Moon Safari. However, they are back in shape for Talkie Walkie, which sees the French duo revisit the subtler musical tastes that made them so popular. The lead single \\"Cherry Blossom Girl\\" is a perfect track. At some points the disc does lag, but that only comes with the territory of being of the chill-out genre.<br />The whistling tune \\"Alpha Beta Gaga\\" is treat. Air are superior when they combine delicate vocals with roving melodies. The key to appreciating Air's music is to give their art to manifest itself on you. When that happens the music will be your friend for life.<br />\\"Surfing On A Rocket\\" has a summery feel, while \\"Universal Traveler\\" flows in arrangement. \\"Alone In Kyoto\\" captures loneliness in a way unlike any other.<br />Air have been the pioneers of the chill-out genre and they continue to develop into the mastermind behind it with Talkie Walkie.
B00005JMCW|1.0|this movie really sucked.  It was so bad, that it actually slowed down time to make viewing it all the more painfull.  it is your typical disney movie, with all their little crappy disney one liners and thier stupid disney lesson to be learned at the end.  Add in a horrible band of one of the main characters and you have grade A crap.
B000165FBC|5.0|Sia hails from Australia and is responsible for one of the best and most underrated pop albums in the past decade. Her debut Healing Is Difficult is the closest thing to perfect. Sia fuses chill-out and pop with a pinch of soul, which makes a formula that is rich in melody. Her collaborations with moody band Zero 7 proved her vocal prowess with tunes such as \\"Destiny.\\" But she also marveled as a solo artist with \\"Drink To Get Drunk\\" and the mesmerizing \\"Judge Me.\\"<br />Colour The Small One is proof that she is here to stay. The underground queen concentrates on creating temperamental, yet scrumptious melodies demonstrated on \\"The Church Of What's Happening Now\\" and the opening track \\"Rewrite.\\" The album does not have any upbeat numbers, but somehow the blend of melancholy with optimism composes a luscious mixture.<br />The album is packed with gems. It's very hard to pick the standout tracks, however, there are a few that stand like a soar thumb. \\"Breathe Me\\" has a kind of glum innocence to it that is rare in music today. \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" has a haunting melody that will leave you wanting more and the closer of the album, \\"Where I Belong,\\" is a masterpiece of modern music<br />There is not one track on Colour The Small One that fails to please. \\"Moon\\" is a simple and dynamic, much like \\"Sunday\\" and the compelling \\"Natale's Song.\\"<br />Colour The Small One is an exceptional album.

630512762X|1.0|I can't stand John Woo films.  All his &quot;action&quot; sequences are done in such a long, drawn-out, slow motion, way that they become simply painful.  They are so slow, they don't feel like action at all.  In my opinion, you don't get the feel of the impacts in the way he does things.  If you like action that looks and feels like real action, and real stunt work, go for Jackie Chan's Rumble in the Bronx, or Brandon Lee's Rapid Fire, or The Crow.
B00008S2VG|3.0|Since the release of 1998's ''Ray Of Light'' Madonna's musical interest seems to have been limited to the electronic/dance sound. The critical-acclaimed ''Ray Of Light'' resulted in perhaps her most creative material to date and launched Madonna back into the charts. 2000's ''Music'' followed the same pattern in terms of success as ''Ray Of Light'' selling a whopping 14 million copies across the globe. The ''Music'' album was quickly followed by ''The Drowned World Tour'' pulling full house everywhere it went. Madonna finally managed to be accepted by the public and critics alike with  her superb music.<br />In 2003 Madonna teamed up with Mirwaiz Ahmadzai once again to produce ''American Life''. Whereas ''Music'' was mainly marketed as a dance album, ''American Life'' was slightly different using the electronic/techno sound to a greater deal. ''American Life'' sees Madonna reflecting upon her past and morals in general. ''American Life'' was lifted as the lead single. We see Madonna reflecting upon her own experiences of the American life. The offering even has Madonna using her rap skills to get her point across though I could have done without it. Admittedly I didn't like ''American Life'' upon my first listen or my tenth for that matter, however the song manages to lure you in with its catchy chorus. The next offering ''Hollywood'' has a killer beat and additive chorus although this version seems a tad to long for my tasting, the repeating of the word ''Hollywood'' finally gets on my nerves on towards the end. The remix version of the instalment is worth a listen as well.<br />Quickly followed by the self-absorption anthem ''I'm So Stupid'', which easily must be one of Madonna's most annoying tracks ever. Her vocals seem complete out of place. Overall I'm utterly disappointed by the her vocals on ''American Life'' as ''Ray Of Light'' had some of her best studio vocal performance ever. However the brilliant offerings ''Love Profusion'' and ''Nothing Fails'' appearto be among her most personal work to date, expressing her love for her husband Guy Richie. ''Nobody Knows Me'' is a up-tempo offering reminiscent to the ''Music'' sound, whereas the opening of ''Intervention'' bares a striking resemblance to a Red Hot Chilli Peppers song. ''X-Static Process'' is carried by an acoustic guitar, stripping the song from the electronic orientated sound. It's quite refreshing compared to the rest of the album. The highly odd ''Mother And Father'' takes on the death of her mother and the struggle coming to terms with it. The verses are sung in a child-like voice whereas the choruses are sung by the ''adult'' Madonna. The topic seems interesting enough, however the song doesn't appear to me at all. <br />Next up is ''Die Another Day'', the song was the James Bond theme and added to the ''American Life'' album. Perhaps due to public demand as it had become a favourite among fans and casual listeners. ''Easy Ride'' is a stunning ballad, easily one of her best offerings at that. The simplicity works quite well with her vocals, which are on pair with those of the ''Ray Of Light'' album. An excellent way to close the album with a song where Madonna reflects upon her life.<br />''American Life'' isn't a bad offering, however the lyrics are a bit tame at times. The overall sound of the album is a bit homogenous for my liking. There simply isn't enough diversity among the song on the album. Having said that ''American Life'' is still worth a spin or two. If you liked the ''Music'' album, the chances are you may be smitten with ''American Life'' as well. If you are just getting it to Madonna, I would highly recommend ''The Immaculate Collection'' to begin with and then take it from there.<br />Overall Rate: 6.5/10
B00006JJ1O|4.0|I would give this album five stars, but some of the songs are quite repetitive.  But most are undeniably catchy.  \\"All the things she said\\" is awesome and practically cries out to be covered by a metal band.  The lyrics will be \\"running through your head, running through your head\\" long after you're done listening to it though.  \\"Malchik Gay\\" is the second most catchy song on the album, and I recommend that those old enough to remember the commercial for monchichi's (monchichi, monchichi, oh so soft and cud-ul-lee!) substitute that commercial's lyrics for the actual lyrics. I guarantee that you'll be giggling for hours.  Their synthesized squeakiness is surprisingly not annoying, and in fact contributes to feeling sympathy for all their lesbian angst. (I'm  rootin' for you girls!) Such sympathy is only slightly tempered by the thought of all the rubles they're rolling in due to the commercial success of this album.  Their cover of the Smiths' \\"How Soon is Now?\\" was a major disappointment though, as they fail miserably to capture any of that song's feelings of despair and loneliness.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|You heard me.  This show is a brilliant blend of scifi, western, drama, action, and horror.  My sixteen-year-old, Dawson's Creek-watching, scifi-hating sister loves this show.  So do I.  And so do you; you just don't know it yet.<br />Also, if you don't buy this DVD, you sleep with men.  Or if you're a woman, than the other thing.
B000002534|4.0|I first heard this album when it first came out when I was a young  teenager, I am now 43 and certain tracks on this album are truly wonderful.<br />Practice What You Preach is a haunting track, a very slow methodical start, with crisp clear tones from Santana's Gibson is spinr tingling, then the percussion, bass and vocals converge to complete a magnificant track.<br />If this track was bought out by a &quot;commercial artiste&quot;  in 2004 it would be hailed as a masterpiece.
B000000HHE|5.0|De La Soul's debut is full of tracks that flow together and are only interupted by the skits. My favorite track on 3 Feet High is Me Myself and I, but they are all great and show the innovative style of De La Soul at the time. I also own De La Soul is dead and this is by far the better album of the two. If you get one De La Soul Album, buy this one.
B00005JLCE|3.0|Monday, February 16, 2004 / 3 of 5 / Once upon a time, I actually liked Madonna's `Marilyn' era.  Pappa Don't Preach and Open Your Heart showed her dancing around as a pale platinum goddess.  This film came out around that time as evidenced by her transformation in the inner city wildlife sanctuary.  I'm not sure if this film has crossed over into camp/cult status but it is often referred to as one of the worst films around.  Foppish Lauden Trott is set to marry ex-16 Candles bombshell when he runs afoul of Madonna playing a framed convict with a whiney slash freaked out way about her.  Hilarity apparently was supposed to ensue.  It's a harmless movie that doesn't aspire to be anything more than it is.  The cougars were beautiful though.

B00028HBKM|5.0|In commemoration of this passion week, I have watched this movie again.  I saw it when it came out in theaters, and I own it on DVD.  As a seminary student, I wish to say a few things about this movie.  Whether or not you agree with me, that is your deal, say what you wish yourself about it.  First off, I want to say I do not like this film.  This is not a fun film.  This is not a film you would go to the Blockbuster to rent on a Friday night, to watch while eating popcorn.  This is a film about Good Friday.  This is a film about the Cross and Jesus' sacrifice.  Thus leads to the second point.  Secondly, this is a brutal film because...and if we are realistic about the Biblical narrative and the history behind the practice of torture and crucifiction by the Romans...we are talking about a truly violent event.  More than violent though, debasingly brutal in every extreme.  There was blood.  There was torn flesh.  There were cries of pain, even from Jesus' lips.  Ergo, we should not turn a blinds eye and forget the true power of what occurred that Friday two thousand years ago.  We should come to this movie in solomn understanding that what we are watching is not going to be enjoyable, but it is necessary for us to see so that we don't \\"pretty\\" the Gospel and skip over the drops of blood from Christ Jesus' body during those hours.  This was a sacrifice in all sense of the words, Jesus was...and is...our \\"Scapegoat,\\" replacing us and bearing the sins for us so that we may (through Him and only Him) come to the Father, Yahweh.  I watch this film because I have to, I need to, I need to be reminded and I need to be counseled in the ways of our Lord and Savior, the one true God, Yahweh, who shows Himself to the world as Jesus Christ.  I must be reminded and be mindful of what Jesus did that Friday along with the Sunday afterwards.  I need to be thoughtful toward the everlasting Gospel of God.  Even though I may disagree with some of the symbolism used (mostly Catholic), I still can take a lot from the film and learn.<br /><br />With that said, I wish to speak to those who have been belittling and accusing this film.  First and foremost, yes it is a Catholic film and there are a lot of Catholic imagery in it.  The way the movie portrays Mary is very Catholic in terms of how she acts and how she is presented.  Is this a bad thing?  Well, as a Protestant seminarian, I have to say, no not for me at any rate.  I understand what is being shown, and while I may disagree with it, I have myself no problem in holding out a hand in friendship to Catholics (i.e., I don't believe in Catholic badging like some people seem to be doing just because Mr. Gibson is a Catholic and uses Catholicism in the story narrative).  Still, you may feel that Mary the mother is given more power than she is truly given in the Bible, for as we read the Bible, and we know the Bible's truth, we see that Mary was just one woman who had given her life to Jesus by accepting the mantel of being the mother.  She is not glorified as the Catholics say she is, in the Bible if you have read your Bible, but she is shown to be a woman (just as mortal as you and I) of faith.  Secondly, I wish to say...as a supporter for such organizations as Jews for Jesus...this film in my opinion is not Anti-Semitic.  There is no Anti-Semitism in this film.  This film does not go out of its way to show the Jews as the \\"bad guys\\" because, if you were watching the same film I was watching, the film showed that there were Jews of all kinds at this dark day-Jews like John the Apostle, Mary the mother of Jesus and Mary the Magdalene, to name a few...then again, it also shows there were wicked men who happened to be Jewish, i.e., the priests who were (if you have read your New Testament and trusted in its authority) of evil hearts toward Jesus.  What this film does is take it out of its Western European pageantry that has been so self evident in Hollywood and placed the true story of Jesus' death andresurrection back to its Jewish roots.  If you really wish to know more about the Bible, and about what the Bible says what happens, read it.  But please, don't throw demons in where there aren't any in the first place.  The film does not assault Jews.  Plain and simple.<br /><br />I hope that you watch this film and consider who Jesus is.  Who Jesus really is.  If you have questions about who God is, Yahweh through Jesus Christ, Yeshua, I suggest you go to my \\"so if you are interested in...guides\\" I've made on Amazon.and resurrection back to its Jewish roots.

0440237688|4.0|The Giver is an interesting book about a world that is controlled and is void of emotions that are painful. They dont have vocabulary for certain words, they only have synonyms. The most important age for a person in the main character Jonas world is 12, the age that a person gets assigned to what he or she will do for the rest of their lives. Jonas finds out that he is going to be a Receiver, and he gets special access to all kinds of memories. When he finds out what life is all about though, Jonas decides that his perfectly constructed world is wrong, and he tries to change it. The novel is a really good one that makes you wonder if something like Jonas world will become our world someday.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|Sure, this album has a low rating, and the music charts will judge this assertion. Recently, it has been awarded having a double platinum by the RIAA, and it clearly supports some of the detractors claim that this album is a sham. &quot;Afterglow&quot; has a low rating, because it show how dynamic Sarah Mclachlan can be that even if there are plethoric synthesizsers, Sarah's voice is lingering and triumphant. Moreover, &quot;Fallen&quot; is an exceptional song, and even without  the other tracks, it can stand alone and reach a multi-platinum stature. This is how dynamic this album is. To add dynamism, tracks &quot;Push,&quot; &quot;Stupid,&quot; and &quot;Drifitn&quot; are other exceptional songs. Clearly, this is a low rating album, and it is even nominated in the Grammy Awards. The 2,000,000 people who bought this album never made a mistake in buying this low rated album, it is very low rated, people are buying it and are enjoying listening to it.
0375701427|5.0|I am not a writer,  I am a reader.  When I find a book as grand as 'American Pastoral', I am truly grateful.  Having come of age in the sixties I can appreciate the right on characterizations, cultural milieu, and the east coast at that time. I'm not from Newark but I am from Queens and somehow they're very connected in my mind.   I hadn't read Mr. Roth's books in decades and I thought of him as 'the guy who wrote Portnoy's Complaint'.  Yes, he is that guy but he has matured in his writing just as his characters have grown, wizened and given life to themselves.  Both Zuckerman and Roth have experienced more over the years.  Life is like that.  A good book is a true find for me.  This is a good book and a great read.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This is an instant classic. The songs are honest and the skits are actually funny. I love it.
B00018D44U|5.0|Miss Jones dazzles us aggain with \\"beyond her years\\" sultry and lanquid lyrics and music. More modern standards appear with What am I to You?, a sprightly upbeat number and Carnival Town, a lanquid country-jazz ballad you'd expect to hear on a 1952 Philco in Ardmore Oklahoma.<br />The whole of the Cd is beautifully recorded, clear and real, no homogonized  over edited pap here, to be sure! Norah is almost a mystical figure, bridging genres and generations as only the great can do!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|...after you finish watching the last of the 14 episodes (at 4:00 in the morning) and realize that there's NO MORE of this wonderful show to be seen.  But don't worry, you'll get over it and eventually appreciate it for the wonderful, if brief, gift that Firefly was to television.  Then hop on over to fireflyfans.net to comisserate with other fans, speculate excitedly about the rumored movie and pray for a return as a TV series!
B00006JU7T|5.0|Of all the films that Al was nominated for and never won, he should have won the Best Actor Oscar for Serpico. One of the most realistic <BR>NYC cop films of the early 70s because of it's grittiness and locations (Check out the old Yankee Stadium in the background when the cops confront Serpico). The music by the Greek musical director will stay with you long after you watch this classic.
B00006F7S4|5.0|I'm drawn much more to Sea Change than to any other of Beck's albums. As everyone else will tell you, every song is deep and self reflective, but the grace that he employs is musically fascinating. This album will really slow things down for you - perfect for reflection and deep thought, or just a rainy day. Highly recommended.
B00005JL5S|5.0|This movie is great!!! GREAT!!! It will not drastically alter the way you think about the world, BUT IT IS INSANELY ENTERTAINING! Its the kind of movie that leaves you feeling excited and happy about the world. I don't know how else to explain it. Do whatever you have to to see this movie!!
B000002I97|5.0|Unfortunately, gone are the days when record companies would sign up an artist that didn't fit into any current categories.  Like some guy that wrote songs while walking his postal route.  If there are songwriters like John out there now we will never get a chance to hear them.  Back in the early 70s so much of the buzz about an obscure artist came from word of mouth promotion.  I remember hearing a band playing &quot;Sam Stone&quot; and it stopped me in my tracks.  I had to know where that song came from.  I bought the lp the next day and became a lifelong fan.  And this album is timeless.  John can have you laughing in one verse and crying like a baby in the next.  He's simply one of the best lyricists I've ever heard.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|How can I express in a mere review the effect this show had on me in such a short timeframe?<br />I was living in Australia when this aired and thus only managed to catch the dribs and drabs, but it was enough to turn me into a Firefly fanatic. After getting the dvds and watching them a number of times, I was left with a feeling of anger towards Fox and its narrowminded decision based on the attitudes of fickle Nielsen families.<br />This show is clever. It is funny. It is suspenseful, intriguing and laden with hooks to keep your interest piqued at all times. You will learn to love Mal, the seemingly harsh yet patriachal captain; Zoe, the dangerously gorgeous pardner; Wash, the wacky pilot; Jayne, the most self-centered &quot;public relations&quot; officer with a sure shot; Kaylee, the perkiest little mechanic in the 'verse; Inara, the most alluring &quot;Ambassador&quot;; and the siblings Tam - fugitives with a shady past. And somehow, a preacher, Shepherd Book - played beautifully by Ron Glass.<br />The Firefly phenomenon continues to grow. Make sure you buy this dvd set, as it is only the beginning. There will be a Firefly movie, and it will be great. Learn to love this series, buy it for your friends, and when the Firefly movie comes in April 2005 ([...] it will be an experience to savor!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly, left TV due to no fault of its own, and here is you chance to see it. It was a show destined for greatness but bad marketing and a show killing time slot put this show to an untimely end.<P>Inventive plots, memorable characters, well-written dialog and visual techniques that haven't been seen in decades give this show a unique look.<P>This is a show that is light-years above anything on TV now. You will see real acting in this show. Summer Glau does an incredible job portraying the emotionally disturbed River Tam. Adam Baldwin adds humor unlike any on TV today in his portrayal of the mercenary Jayne Cobb. Serenity (The ship) is one extremely detailed set, it looks like a real space ship. They really built all 190 feet of the insides of the ship.<P>Take a hint from the thousands of people who have purchased this DVD set, buy this and share with your friends.
B00007GZR5|5.0|I was reading the online remarks about the movie and landed on one inpaticular I think the persons online name was Iwijaya. Obviously this person has no clue what it takes to really see a movie especially a movie as deeply moving as this one. Deeply moving to someone such as Iwijaya would have to be either a good bowel movement or one of these movies such as Friday. Don't get me wrong I laughed all the way through that movie, but know one said that this movie was suppose to be entertainment for someone that doesn't entertain easy. This was a very deep and compeling movie. If your interested in a movie that you only have to watch briefly while you have other things going on around you than this definetly isn't the movie for you! It is a real heart clencher, and it truely makes you think. So if your someone like Iwijaya who just isn't ready for a movie that, if opened minded, can really make you feel every emotion there is to feel, than I suggest something easy like Daddy Daycare or Finding Nemo something that won't really make you think but will give you a laugh. Maybe this film should have been rated for MATURE addience only!!!!:)Don't mean to cut you down I just can't fathom if you truley watched this movie it could have made you feel this way. I've watched so many movies and have never remarked to any except this one because it was so compelling. I beleive the actors should have won nominees for such outstanding acting. To see the intensity they put through in there characters was nothing short of amazing! Watch it again sometime and not only can you see it in there eyes but you can feel it in there soul, you have to be one fine actor to be able to portray such a tuff and compelling role and actually bring those characters to life!
B000066NW0|4.0|&quot;Let Go&quot; by Avril Lavigne is not bad album.<br />If it the one thing I dig about her songs is that you can really relate to it. Songs such as &quot;Unwanted&quot;, &quot;Anything but Ordinary&quot;, &quot;I'm With You&quot;, &quot;My World&quot;, and &quot;Nobody's Fool&quot; are easy for me to relate. The music made by her band in these songs and the others are awesome.<br />So, why did I  put four stars and not five? Well, truth to be told... though her songs are extremely well done, her voice isn't exactly the best of its kind. I don't really know how to describe it, but it sounds kind-of, well... worn out.<br />But in total, this CD definitely earns itself four stars.
B000001GRZ|5.0|This is in my opinion one of the absolutely best recordings of Bach's cello suites, and to put this in perspective I am comparing to Casals and Yo-Yo Ma. Fournier has the technical mastery to find every hidden depth in these pieces, and to me this is the most truely baroque interpretation. For a recording that was made forty years ago the sound quality is very good, not surpring, though, since it is a DGG recording.
0786868694|2.0|If you are already a fan of Nigella Lawson and her television program, you may find this book charming and worthwhile.  I, who have never seen her show, found it to be fairly worthless as a cookbook of substance.  For as large and expensive a book as it is, it really has very little content, and the haphazard selection of recipes have nothing in common except that they were at one time or another featured on her show.  I am sure there are some lovely recipes in here, but I didn't find any that I was interested in making, and the hit-or-miss nature of this sort of random compliation practically guarantees that many others will have the same experience.  In other words, it reads less like a helpful, informative cooking book, and more like a quick way to cash in on Ms. Lawson's current popularity without having to make the effort of actually writing a new book.  I would recommend you avoid it in favor of any book that purports to specialize in something that interests you - you'll stand a much better chance of finding the recipes you need to expand your repertoire.
B0000CFW87|5.0|It's sad to see people trash such a talented artist. If you're not here to review the CD then don't waste my time with your opinion. Amazon.com is not a message board and shouldn't be used as one. Those spamming with one-star reviews should be embarrassed. You have absolutely NO credibility!!! No one should have to give adults this kind of lecture. Anyways...<br />\\"Closer\\" is such a well crafted CD. Every time I listen to it, it truly moves me. He's so young, but his voice reveals none of its youth. It's grand and mature, better than I expected. Each song is a true gift to the listener. When I play Josh's CD it brightens my day. I'm 29 years old, so you're never too young or too old to love Josh Groban.<br />Josh sticks to the basics on this recording and that's why it's refreshing. He's trying to blow you away, but not completely turn you off. The perfect example is \\"Broken Vow.\\" He paints it with extravagance only when it's necessary. He's learning. And the more he measures his talent and treats it like how an artist would use color, he will get even better. His voice is a great instrument and he's just learning how to play it, so it's exciting to watch him this early in his career. Most artists with the size and grandeur of Josh's voice would have made listening to \\"Broken Vow\\" a chore. But his subtle brilliance reminds me of why he is so infectious.  <br />On songs like \\"Oceano,\\" \\"Mi Mancherai,\\"  \\"Per Te,\\" and \\"Caruso\\" his potential is stated definitively. Josh makes it look so easy. I don't speak Spanish, French, or Italian, but his voice breaks so many barriers that you won't miss the English translations. 6 out of the 13 songs are in English, so you really can't complain. This also showcases Josh's versatility.<br />But I want to be clear, this is POP music. So those of you that might be intimidated by the term \\"classical\\" shouldn't be. These songs are for everyone. This is something that the entire family can enjoy and love for a lifetime. Buy with confidence. I hope you enjoy it as much as I have. <br />Note: I'm praying that \\"Broken Vow\\" is his next single. Josh I hope you're listening. Now I'm revealing my youth. Oh, well. I tried. :-)
B00005JMCN|3.0|Like gnawing on a tasteless biscuit that has, in fact, been floating out on the seas way too long. Let's start (and maybe finish) with my first complaint. What's with that sappy, cigar addled Jimney Cricket-esque, nostalgia-obsessed - cliched beyond belief - narration that accompanies black and white shots from the past as boringly as any car commercial? Have we become so roboticized to actually fall for that act ad infinitum (ad nauseum)?<br />Yes, Jeff Bridges is endearing, and Toby ain't too shabby either but the film was filled with formulaic tactics that simply take away from the beauty of the scenes and the appreciable performances.<br />I must admit, at times I was swept up in the grandeur of the flick and who wasn't rooting for the underhorse at every gallop; however, I am sick of the formula!!! Please give us something truly unique. It doesn't matter if the film is based on a true story if the story is told like a billion others.<br />All it would have taken, in my humble opinion, would be some sort of &quot;cliche-checker&quot; ensuring that the film be ridded of any overtly formulaic or snooze-inducing cliches (like the good ole boy American narration). Perhaps this is mean of me; but how many agree that we have seen these tactics way too much? Just because it pleases the marketing research panels and promises to pack the crowds does not translate to quality. The film could have been great without the cliches!!!<br />Sorry.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I don't understand what all the hype was about.  Nothing happened during the entire movie.  Don't waste your time!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is my first time reviewing anything on amazon.com.  The only reason I wrote this review was because of the greatness that this show could have achieved.  Tsk...tsk...tsk... Fox did it once again... Keen Eddie, The Tick...and now, my favorite show on TV. <br />I have watched the DVD set over and over again... each time guessing and searching for clues to the Preacher's identity, the Blue Sun's hedious plan, Inara's reason for running, what power in the 'verse will stop River, more on the Reevers, and of course many other questions.  This show slowly unfolds showing all its characters, plot points, and of course clever humor.  Every time I reach the end of Episode 14, I shake my head and incert disc 1 into the dvd player and ening it all over again.<BR>  <BR>PS. Cancelled to make room for a lovely reality show... great joice no?  And yes, I sing the theme song every single time.

B000127LW2|3.0|Voyager's concept was to show what would happen to a crew stranded far from home, away from the protection of Starfleet and the Federation, with a crew made up of politically correct Starfleet officers and survivors of defiant Federation constituents. Before her mission can begin, the crew is swept the crew 70, 000 light years away, into the uncharted space of the Delta Quadrant. But from the beginning, it seemed Voyager was doomed. While the series was a return to TOS old fashioned naval romance, it had a dangerous corporate utopian view that I was unable to overlook. That said, however, the opener was not half-bad, and it set up many, many story ideas that could have been expounded on. One might have been the mixing of the Starfleet crew and the Maquis crew -a strong criticism of the show has been the lack of tension between the Starfleet and Maquis crews, something which many thought should have been explored in much more detail. Or Tom's voyage from a misguided youth to redemption (something that was covered a bit in season' one and two- all part of a plan to discover who was sending transmissions to the Kazon, and then oddly picked up again in season five -which by then seemed out of character), to the plight of Harry as always an ensign and never anything more How about Tuvok, who must deal with Chakotay as his commanding officer (one guessed that Tuvok was a full commander during the pilot, and somehow was demoted). But all of that was quickly brushed aside like so much dead leaves under the TNG's jingoistic notion that we were all one, big happy family. They took away the conflict, which was odd, considering that during TNG's run, most critics agreed that its biggest problem was that was too little conflict between the characters. Voyager returned to TOS (and TNG somewhat) of episodic story telling. The only real arc to the series would be them lost in the Delta Quadrant. The issue from the start, whether from the Paramount executives or Brannon Braga and Rick Berman, was that the show should remain self-contained. So with Voyager, the show was designed not for the fans of either TNG or DS9, but for the causal fan; for the viewer who could not remember the show was on week-to-week, the \\"absentee viewer\\" as someone once put it. So the story telling of DS9 was replaced, because those themes were \\"too lofty for a (show like Voyager's) broad-based audience,\\" as Michael Piller put it in an interview with the official Star Trek website. That locution, in particular, has become an over used catch phrase, which can easily be translated as straight, white males So continuity and the Prime Directive (one of my favorite examples comes in a line written Braga, the worst of the lot when it came to the Prime Directive, in the episode Prototype, where Janeway spouts something about who are we to play God and then continue on our way? The only answer, of course, was the crew of Voyager. It would only get worst as the series progressed) were tossed out airlock with the baby water, all in the name of telling a story. As the first season progressed, it wobbled, it sank, it rose, and it shifted its concept like sand in a desert. It introduced two very inferior alien enemies, the Kazon and the Vidiian's. Both failed because they weren't sinister enough to scare a cockroach back into its dark corner. The Kazon, who where to be based on L.A. gangs, were just a bunch of petulant children who had cool ships, but were always fighting to find out which sect would rule. And despite the Seska/Culluh alliance, they never were more menacing than stock TV villains. The Vidiian's, while creepy, were mishandled. Besides they weren't really evil, they just did appalling things in pursuance of their goals (and might I add here's where a continuity expert should have been hired. In Phage, Janeway makes it perfectly clear that if the Vidiians interfere with them again, she'll open a can of whoop ass on them. Alas, when they pop up again in Faces, nothing happens to them). So, these two were not the Klingons or the Cardassians. They were just boring. So, the first season limped along like a cart with a misalign wheels. And while most of the acting was good outside of Mulgrew's, the stories lacked real originality, filled with terminally uninteresting characters, and featured way to much technobabble, with Time and Again being one of the most well known episodes to go overboard using it. Most of the stories seemed to be hobbled together from other concepts; as if Piller, Berman and Braga took all the stories they had not used on TNG and DS9 and tried to make them some how work on Voyager. But proposing the same flawed ideas over and over again was not making the show good. Only Eye of the Needle and Jetrel can be said to be one of the best of the first season, and while I enjoyed Emanations (because it will become a rare treat to watch Garrett Wang at the center of a story), the rest of season lacked a certain quality.
B000003CKH|5.0|This is by far the greatest CD ever made.
B00018D44U|4.0|I must say that I first became aware of Ms. Jones on Wax Poetic's album and fell in love with the sound of her voice and musical style.  I wasn't an immediate fan of \\"Come away with me\\" even though it had some \\"jazz\\" nuances, there was always the hint of country lingering in the air.  This recording is quite the opposite, country(bluegrass) with hardly any hint of \\"jazz\\".  I am NOT a country fan, however, I have to rate this CD high because it dares to be different.  In the era of mass-produced, obviuosly sexual over, under and outright tones, what a welcome relief Norah Jones is.  Timberlake, Spears, Aguilar and the slew of other \\"artist\\" are doing what Prince, George Clinton and Sly Stone were doing in the 60's, 70's and 80's and Clinton and the boys did it better.  Why? Because they never stuck to the music of the day, they dared to be different.  Ms. Jones is of that genre, she is daring to be different in an age of \\"Corporate Artist\\".  Like Ani Difranco and other indies, Norah is a breath of fresh air in a polluted musical environment.  So, even though I am not a \\"country\\" music fan, I am a fan of artists who go against the grain...Listener's must be detoxed to appreciate pure, honest and daring music.

Why this album bothers me: (1)AS I AM is a great song, it sets you up for the inevitable let down. (2)Actual Metallica riffs are used... and often(listen for One and Blackened. Upon closer inspection apparent lifts from Sanitarium, Orion, and other classic metal standards will appear)! (3) The Vocals (4) The lyrics (5) They are capable of so much more!!
B0001AP12G|5.0|KANYE WEST IS UNEQUIVICALLY THE BEST PRODUCER AROUND...<br />Even before knowing he produced such hits as Talib Kweli's &quot;Get By&quot;, Jay Z's &quot;The Takeover&quot; &amp; &quot;Encore&quot;, Lil Kim's &quot;I Came Back For You&quot;, and Alicia Key's &quot;You Don't Know My Name&quot;, I knew Kanye was one of the best around. Now as I learn of all the songs he's produced, Kanye has become one of my favorite producer/rappers around. Of course The Neptunes and Missy &amp; Timbaland have definitely set standards for the producer/rapper category; however, Kanye has taken it to a whole new level. His beats are original and unstoppable (not to mention he's a cutie). No other producer brings the heat like Kanye does. Along with his fire-blazing beats, Kanye also shines on the lyrical aspect. From his survival story in &quot;Through The Wire&quot;, to his self conscious lyrics in &quot;All Falls Down&quot;, to his struggles and hustles in &quot;Spaceship&quot;, his cry out for help to God in &quot;Jesus Walks&quot;, and even his promise to keep bringing the heat in &quot;Never Let Me Down&quot;, Kanye's intelligent lyrics match his impressive beats to compose &quot;The College Dropout&quot;. West is definitely &quot;THE FUTURE OF HIP HOP&quot;...looks like there's hope for Hip Hop afterall.

Simple Plan does all those things mediocre at best. Okay, they have light humor in some songs, but not the kind that would make you burst out laughing like Blink-182. They touch on emotion in a way in Perfect, but the singers voice is so laughable that you cant take it seriously. If you want pop-punk with emotion try New Found Glory. They cant write good, varied songs either. All their songs are about love or them whining about something. If you want a band that writes about lots of topics and has some meaning, try Good Charlotte (their not nearly as bad as alot of people think). If you want pop-punk with quick guitar riffs and good solos, try Sum 41. Some songs on here are okay, but like I said, SP is just a mediocre version of all those bands I mentioned before.
0385504209|1.0|Contrary to one reviewer's assessment, you don't have to be Catholic to find this book less than entertaining, enlightening, or both.<br />What started out as a promising suspence thriller quickly degenerated into a strange theological lecture.  If I had been in the market for strange theological lectures, this might have worked for me--though even then I might be tempted to say &quot;so what&quot;.  I'm not naive enough to say I don't know what the fuss is about, but though a devout believer in Christ, it doesn't affect me much--married, not married, childless, or not.  I believe in his divinity and the arguments offered were not particularly bothersome or convincing.<br />But back to the fiction.  The technique of leaving the reader hanging throughout the novel over and over again, strikes me as a cheap sort of trick for a writer who can't maintain suspense in an honest sort of way.<br />I must agree with those who critiqued the puzzles as sort of purile.  Someone gave me this advice once which I would like to pass on to Dan Brown.  Never try to write characters who are smarter than you are.<br />All in all, though, I have gained one bit of unexpected entertainment from this novel.  I have enjoyed reading the reviews which are full of a passion and honesty entirely missing from the novel. So I add my voice to throng.
0156027321|3.0|I was told its a true story.  That kind of affected the way I read it.  But still enjoyed the ride.<br />The religious undertones seem pointless...I could have done without them.<br />I still dont believe in god.  They shouldnt have put that on the cover...false advertising.<br />The story was nice.  Kinda like a long R rated fable (for Gratuitous Survival Violence)
B00005OWIU|5.0|I love the movies ,esp. the first one&amp;quot;harry potter and the sorcres stone&amp;quot; and the music really makes it even MORE enchanting. The way they piece the music is magical and whimsicle, and it takes u into another world. I may still be a teen and i'm usally listening to the hippest music, but this cd is a definite exception.Every h.p. fan should buy a copy. Worth the money.
B00018D44U|5.0|I am one of the seemingly few who did not go gaga over Norah's first cut, except maybe \\"Dont know why.\\" But who'd have expected her understated supper-club tunes to outgun scientifically engineered chartbusters from the ilk of Spears and Aguilera. Instead of making any stupid concessions to her sudden celebrity with Oakenfold remixes and Santana collaborations the \\"Home\\" girl plays it cool, carrying on with the same smooth vibes that made her what she is.<br />New songs like \\"Carnival Town\\", \\"Sunshine\\" and \\"Those Sweet Words\\" maintain the simple, uncomplicated air of her previous stuff. Meanwhile, some tunes get a light country-tinged kick (\\"The Long Way Home,\\" \\"What Am I to You?\\"), highlighted by the Dolly Parton duet \\"Creepin' In.\\"<br />A great steal for some easy listening..
B00005JKC3|1.0|Worst editing I've ever seen - and I've seen some awful editing.<BR>It's like they gave an editor's job to a high school student and told them to transition every shot a different way, anyway they could think of.  <BR>The story was very bad as well.  Talk about an awful ending...
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Too bad they found it.<BR>Let me start with the good news; we survived the showing. I would have given it a lower rating but one star is as low as they go. Words like &quot;horribly boring, &quot;pointless&quot;, and &quot;why bother&quot; would normally spring to mind, but our mind had gone numb with confussion. Why would a geat talent like Bill Murry do a terrile movie like this? Why would anyone spend time seeing a movie like this? People who enjoyed this movie are the sames ones who enjoy watching paint dry.<br />Now for the bad news. This is definitely one of the worst movies ever made. Please speard the word, tell your friend, send out junk email - &quot;Don't let your friends see this complete junk&quot;.

B000127LW2|5.0|Of all the Star Trek series ever made, Voyager ranks as my all time favorite. Why? If James Cameron had written and directed for a Star Trek series, it would have been Voyager. Never in the history of the Star Trek series have there been so formidable an assortment of strong female lead and supporting characters on one ship. And kudos to Kate Mulgrew for giving us one of the most heroic and formidable starship captains of all time. Hows that for a novel female lead. That woman was robbed by the Emmys. This series is also what is what it was intended to be, the most intensely action packed of them all. No starship in Starfleet history has taken the beating that Voyager has.  And Voyager boasts more battle sequences and Borg for your buck than any of its predecessors, including one very formidable Borg Queen. For best achievement in lighting, art direction, acting and special effects and sound, Voyager has my vote. And if you don't believe that, have a look at Star Trek the Next Generation and compare its dated special effects, make-up and horrid lighting (not to mention bad actors, with the exception of the Captain and Data). Also try comparing the acting talents and characters of Next Generation to Voyager, B'Elanna Torres compared to Geordi La Forge? Dr. Beverly Crusher compared to THE DOCTOR? Data compared to Seven of Nine? Please Oh and lets not forget the horror of Next Generations Natasha Tasha Yar and Wesley Crusher ugggghhh. Give me Katherine Janeway, The Doctor, Seven of Nine and the entire crew of the Starship Voyager any day. The episodes: Scorpion One and Two should have been made into a major motion picture. Two of the most brilliantly written star trek episodes ever. Look for those episodes in future DVD releases. Need I say more? Run, don't walk to order yours now.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Never have I fallen so hard, so fast for a TV show.  Then had it pulled out from under me so that I fall again, but not in a good way.<br />Everything about this show is pitch perfect.  The actors, sets, stories, dialouge, music.  I love it all.  I read an interview with the man that did the music for the show.  Everyone who worked on that show is still hurt that it was cancelled.  Most Hollywood professionals have no real attachment to their projects.  Firefly was different.<br />You really need to give this a show look if you are interested in Sci Fi.  I don't think you will be disappointed.<br />Keep flying...

B0000DZEA1|5.0|The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the king is one of the BEST Movies ever made in history. If you've seen it you know exactly what i'm talking about, which i'm pretty sure that most of you have. Seeing the movies and hearing the music playing is the best thing you can ask for.  Every tune is so perfect and fits well with each and every scene.  This soundtrack is one of the best ever along side with the other two soundtracks. Props for Howard Shore, he has done an extremely excellent job.  I recommend this cd for people who love soundtracks and for those who don't, because you will fall in love with it just as i have.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|After a lengthy absence, Britney has returned with her fourth studio album, In The Zone, and with racy lyrics, sexy electro beats and seductive vocals, is obviously trying take the route Christina Aguilera took, going from pop princess to dirrty sex goddess. On 'In The Zone', don't expect the catchy bubblegum pop of 'Oops, I Did It Again!' and '(You Drive Me) Crazy', because you certainly are not going to find it here. Instead, we have a collection of slutty, un-inspiring, boring clubbing tunes, which makes 'In The Zone' about essential as a kick up the backside.<br />So why does all this fail so badly? Lets start with the first single to be lifted from the album 'Me Against The Music'. Featuring a god awful contribution from Madonna, with a tuneless beat and awful vocals, needless to say this is a deeply dreary three minutes. Thigs get even worse on '(I Got That) Boom Boom', as she hires the help of the Ying Yang twins to seemlingly create one of the most painful, ear bleeding songs you are likely to ever hear, with an awful tribal beat.<br />Moving onto 'Breathe On Me' and 'Touch Of My Hand', Britney is obviously trying her uppermost best to try and create the cool, electro and alluring sound that Kylie has made so famous, but does she suceed? Hell no. The fact that Spears has the sexual charisma of a three year old doesnt help matters either. 'Early Morning', which was penned by Moby is boring and feels like it lasts for four hours as opposed to minutes, and 'Outrageous' has one of the most annoying chrouses I think I have ever heard. Gloopy ballads 'Shadow' and 'Everytime' are crap attempts at showcasing Britneys vocal ability, the problem being she has the vocal range of a cauliflower.<br />To be fair, 'Toxic' is an erotic slice of pop, and 'Showdown' is a funky three minutes, but those two songs are the only half decent ones on the entire album. I haven't even metioned laughable reggae attempt 'The Hook Up' and the less said about the horrendous cheesefest that 'Brave New Girl', the better. So Britney has obviously tried to reinvent herself as the latest Kylie/Christina with her latest album, needlessly to say, she has failed badly. Whereas Christina has been selling millions of albums worldwide, 'In The Zone' is so bad, I'll be shocked if it has even went platinum in the UK. A definate must miss, even for the biggest Britney fans.
1577311523|5.0|Amazing! I knew before reading this book I was living in the past and future, but reading this opened my eyes so much I was shocked. It's been a month since I finished reading &quot;THE POWER OF NOW&quot;, and believe it or not, by practicing just a little of what I read in this book I haven't had any depression episodes AT ALL (I use to have them every hour of the day!). To say this book changed my life is an understatement. I'm not going to say this book is for everyone, but it's my belief if you're living in the past and doing nothing but worrying about the future (even about things that may never happen!) this book is the best thing you can buy for yourself, it will definitely make you realize a thing or two.<br />&quot;THE POWER OF NOW&quot; is in my top five favorite books (maybe even at the top). Fire your therapist, flush the psych pills down the toilet, just read this.
B0000YEEGM|3.0|Basically this is a great movie to buy I am so glad to see this film at least back on DVD again I was sad to see a few months ago when I tried to purchase it the film was out of print but now MGM has released the DVD Special Edition of this film. First you have the film picture looks great nice widescreen version. That deleted scene features Dustin Hoffman escaping Tom Cruise trying to buy those infamous Cheese Balls he eats through out the film and Hoffman goes into the store and pulls that typical run of the mill &quot;Rain Man&quot; skit and the shopkeeper does not understand and Tom Cruise finds him and rescues him. That kind of part is shown in different places in the movie overall the scene lacks substance and once again like many of these DVD's with deleted scenes we can all clearly see why this little scene was taken out of the film. Now you have that commentary remember now it is 3 separate commentary tracks not a bunch of guys talking together. It would have been really nice for Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman to do a Commentary track but I guess Cruise was to busy with &quot;The Last Sumarai&quot; and Hoffman had to make his 100th movie by now. You get this Barry Levinson track which is probably the most useful good but not great. The other two commentary tracks feature I believe the guy who wrote the screenplay Ronald Bass if you have the time all 3 tracks probably are somewhat useful but also a little dull. Then you have a featurette from 1988! but boohoo it mostly contains bits from the movie a few moments with Tom Cruise saying that typical statement about a movie that he believes that this is going to be a great film he was right and director Barry Levinson did a fantastic job with this movie it just captures everything nice about a film the mood is nice and actors are great and the story is well told. Rain Man is a classic and will live on as a key career success for Tom Cruise and Dustin Hoffman. Oh Yeah there is also a photo album of some photos ifyou have that kind of time. Rain Man Special Edition justs gets by with the film itself and I just ignore the extras and watch the film.
B0000DYJM6|4.0|Being a fan of Nirvana for some time i was at the shops and i was looking for a nirvana cd, unable to find what i was looking for i noticed &quot;Lost Dogs&quot;. Although many fans of Nirvana are opposed to Pearl Jam and dismiss them as &quot;Simply Corporate&quot;  i find that after purcahsing &quot;Lost Dogs&quot; many could be wrong as it contains some of the finest Pearl Jam work i have heard and has a more grungy flavour than their other albums. A MUST FOR FANS OF EXCELLANT GRUNGE.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What can I say that hasn't been said already? Firefly wasn't given enough time to really &quot;fly&quot;.  It is one of those shows that we the fans were robbed before its truest potential could be realized.  I urge people to buy this DVD. I personally don't think you have to be a sci-fi fan to like it or &quot;get it&quot;. If you like smart writing and are looking for something unique and wonderful...get this DVD.
1869504917|5.0|I just returned from New Zealand. This book is everywhere there at substancially more money.It is supposedly a best seller there.That aside if you want to know about where some of the movie sites are, this book will pinpoint it down for you. It is a good thing to read before you go. Many, many of the sites are on private land there and you can't get to them, others are way, way down dirt roads and best accessable by 4x4,car rental companies severly frown on using their cars on unpaved roads. The GPS coordinates are in the book and you may want to try to find them yourself. However, several local tour companies have sprung up, especially in the Queenstown and Matamata area, that use this book and will take you to the exact locations quickly. I found the book a real asset in that it not only told you things about the movie but also delved into interesting related sites, like what to see in Wellington or Te Anua. I learned from the book that Hobbiton is still partially in existance, far of in the middle of a huge sheep station, only accessible by a local tour company. To know that is worth the price of the book.

B00008J4P5|3.0|&quot;Elephant&quot; reminds me of the time I found a 50-year-old bottle of Grand Marnier in my grandma's basement. It had kind of a fruity, retro-thrill about it; it definitely went down raw; and it gave me a nice buzz. But I got tired of it REAL quick. Adults know you can get a better bang for your buck. In the end, &quot;Elephant&quot; isn't much more than decent blues-rock record, thrashing around like a trout just hauled up to the pier. There's some charm in Jack's spazzy delivery and the goofball lyrics (&quot;the hardest button to button&quot; is genius -- it sounds banal and portentous at the same time), but the package as a whole is way too flimsy to support the hype. What's become of rock 'n' roll when an album like this tops every other &quot;Best of 2003&quot; list?

B0000VJFP0|5.0|June 8th, 1988.  A day that will live in infamy for every Depeche Mode fan.  The day that this masterful and truly influential band performed at the famed Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California during their legendary Music For The Masses tour.  If there are truly defining moments in life, then this certainly was one of them for DM.  <br />As the opening track PIMPF plays, the crowd begins to lose control and as soon as Behind The Wheel starts up, they've completely lost it.  Dave, Martin, Andy, &amp; Alan are all in top form, playing and performing with an intensity unmatched by any other.  <br />Most bands never sound half as good live as they do in the studio.  Depeche Mode make it look easy.  With the live version of Stripped, DM take an already fantastic single and make it ten times better.  Utilizing a mix of Stripped called the Highland Mix, the boys take the opening notes, and instead of cutting them off short as they had originally done, they hold them the full length, which changes the whole diameter of the piece, giving it this truly epic feel.  The crowd noise only enhances the experience, giving you this feeling as if the entire world is there screaming and cheering.  After Dave sings the first verse and chorus, he cries out defiantly, &quot;Yeeeaaaaaaaggggghhhhh!!!!!!!&quot; igniting the crowd and it is such a powerful moment to behold.  I have heard Stripped performed many times, but never with the same strength, passion and veracity that was shown here.  I only wish this live version had been released as a single because it truly deserves the status.  It is a classic performance all its own.<br />Martin Gore, our loving curly blonde songwriter, performs three very memorable songs for this concert: Somebody, The Things You Said, and A Question of Lust.  Somebody is a love song so honest, pure and forthright in its intentions that one is overcome by its emotional resonance.  The live version gives this very intimate song a public feel as the crowd watches and cheers for Martin.  As he sings &quot;ten..der..lyyyyy&quot;, you know there isn't a dry eye on any teenage girl's face.  It's quite interesting that Martin follows up Somebody with The Things You Said, a very melancholy song about betrayal and disappointment which is a complete contrast to Somebody.  Later on, A Question of Lust is performed, which is another passionate piece by Martin that's as deep and tender as it is inordinately honest and sweet.  All very beautifully performed by Mr. Gore. <br />&quot;A Brief..Period..Of Rejoicing&quot;.  The words spoken by Mute Records own Daniel Miller.  The song: Black Celebration.  A song so darkly gothic and pure, that one becomes lost in it's beautiful tranquility (and never wants to be found).  This song speaks to us all, and when performed live, Dave is singing to the choir as it were.  This live version from 101 is loved also for speeding up the pace of the song, giving it this added extra urgency.  It's hard to believe that this piece never became a single.  <br />Another standout moment from 101 is Never Let Me Down Again, a song written on the grand scale with much debate over it's subject matter (Drugs?  Homosexuality? Or just Martin's experience at taking a plane trip with a friend?)  101 director D.A. Pennebaker assumes it's about drugs, but is he right?  The band of course never comment.  The 101 live version of Never Let Me Down Again is best remembered for Dave getting the crowd to wave their hands back and forth in the air during the instrumental sequence of the song, as if they were fields of wheat blowing in the wind.    <br />Everything Counts, the final song performed, is the icing on the cake.  This is one of the best pieces of music that Depeche Mode have ever used to close a concert.  It's perfect because not only is it a tremendously powerful song all its own, but it involves the audience at the end.  : &quot;The grabbing hands, grab all they can!  Everything Counts in large amounts!&quot; over and over again in unison.  A very bonding experience for both the band and the audience.  After such a breathtaking performance of all these songs, it's hard to believe that the band had thought they had played badly when they left the stage.  Very humbling.  But it couldn't be further from the truth.  101 is truly a defining moment for Depeche Mode.<br />Now finally, all these years later since this epic event, 101 the concert has been digitally remastered as a Super Audio CD (SACD) in 5.1 Surround Sound &amp; 2.0.  The original 2.0 Stereo version is also included on this 2 disc set.  You must have a SACD Player in order to listen to the concert in 5.1, otherwise it will just play in 2.0 Stereo. According to different sources there are errors on tracks 3, 4 and 5. The multi-channel playback does not work on these tracks.  Still, a small price to pay to have this remastered 2CD in my opinion.  <br /> <BR>As a special bonus, the entire opening of PIMPF is included on Disc 2.  A few minutes after Everything Counts ends, PIMPF begins.  A wonderful treat.  This SACD is the perfect companion to the 101 DVD and a nice addition to any Depeche Mode collection.  <br />Keep Moding!<br />LCDStumm101 / 0724359470726

B0000AQS0F|5.0|The saddest thing about this DVD is it represents the entire run of this series.  Most TV shows, Joss Whedon's own Buffy and Angel included, need at least half a season or more to really hit their stride.  Firefly hit the ground running and never looked back.  Every episode is brilliant.  Despite a large cast he manages to make each character very different from one another in a short amount of time.  There is a wide variety in the episodes - everything from stealing medicine from a hospital to returning a friends corpse to his family.<P>Even more important is the episodes are infinitely rewatchable, without exception.  In fact, they are better the second, third, or tenth time around - you will notice details you missed before.  A great reward for dedicated fans that very few shows can acheive... and few even attempt.
B000002BBY|5.0|Oasis was &quot;The Next Big Thing&quot; that wasn't.  After their solid debut on &quot;Definitely Maybe&quot;, the band uncorked one of the best albums of the last twenty years with &quot;(What's the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;, which has been fittingly described as a pop-rock gem. Oasis takes all of their influences, from the Beatles, Rolling Stones, et al., and runs with them. Sadly, Oasis' hubris turned against them; they began delving into a destructive cycle of unrestrained indulgence and personnel changes, the effect of which is sadly chronicled in their subsequent releases.  They may have peaked too early, but few bands have ever peaked as high as Oasis did with &quot;Morning Glory&quot;.  It's a shame it didn't last.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I wish my words could do justice to this engaging piece of television. But that would be impossible! Band Of Brothers is moving ... entertaining ... exciting ... and eye opening! The acting and directing is amazing and makes you feel like the bullets are buzzing by YOUR head. I'm usually bored by anything dealing with history, but this was awesome. GUARANTEED: You will find Band Of Brothers as thrilling as it is inspiring.
0452282152|5.0|Girl with a Peral Earring is one of the most well thought of and creative books I have ever read. Although some of these characters are real people they are caught in Mrs. Chevalier's world. Vermeer is described as a mysterious man. He says little, but the descripition of his fierce and gentle glances and looks are better than a thousand words. I think that Griet, the maid, is the most realistic fictional character in reading. If I had heard any other theory about who the lady in the painting was, I would be convinced it was wrong! A defenite must read!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never had a chance to watch Firefly during its brief lifespan on Fox, (almost seemed like Fox was playing a shell game and making it difficult) but I looked forward to purchasing the DVD set when it became available. What a great series! A Sci-Fi Western as well done as most feature films. Like so many others who have reviewed the Firefly set, I ended up watching all of the episodes over three nights marathon-style, all the while both marveling at the quality of the acting, writing, music and overall production values, and disbelieving that anything this wonderful could be cancelled! Well, leave it to Fox, I guess. The cast of Firefly achieved a chemistry that only rarely is seen on television, and usually only after two or three seasons, if at all. My father-in-law and my son who were both visiting also quickly became converted and purchased their own sets. This is a series which continues to resonate within you long after you finish watching. You absolutely cannot go wrong buying this DVD set!

I know you meant for this book to end my favorite series, but I still see little trails where Fitz could pick up...These characters are too real to me - I dreamed about them!

I read it too fast -I couldn't make myself slow my reading to savor it, and now my teenager has it and won't do his homework!

B00005JLO2|3.0|I had the priviledge of viewing the inital cut of this film in February or March of 2001 at a length of just over 3 hours.  Kapur captured the quality of Mason's text and delivered a period piece that would have been favorably compared to Elizabeth.  By the time this version of Feathers was cut down to the edition released to the public, it had lost all of the artistry and substance that it contained.  Miramax has effectively taken a film that I counted as one of my all-time favorites and reduced it to one that I will not even rent.  If a Director's Cut version of this film was released that included the first cut, I would buy it in an instant, but in it's current incarnation it just a mediocre movie.
B0000024W3|5.0|Funny how this is such a polarizing album.  I think fans of Dylan who just wanted more of what he had produced before were disappointed when they were not fed the familiar and rejected this work out of hand.  As for Dylan panning it, I'd never believe anything an artist says about his own work one way or the other.  The fact of the matter is that this is a great album that stands the test of time.  Whenever I put it on, even after months or years, it always stands up and I always am glad to have come back to it.  I think the album is aptly named.  It seems to me to be an intimate and honest glimpse into music that are part of the core of Dylan as an artist.  He's not trying to make social statements here, he's making musical art.

Dan Brown's writing is horrendous - reminiscent of bad Nancy Drew novels of my childhood, except with more useless information thrown in every other paragraph. Seriously now -<br />\\"His usually sharp blue eyes looked hazy and drawn tonight. A dark stubble was shrouding his strong jaw and dimpled chin. Around his temples, the gray highlights were advancing, making their way deeper into his thicket of coarse black hair.\\" (pg. 8)<br />gag. Along with a quick mention of his Mickey Mouse watch later on, this is the only characterization of Robert Langdon that is provided.<br />However, I read on, as I generally give a bad book 50 pages before putting it down, and I've got to admit that it hooked me by that point, and I sucked the novel down quickly. What Brown lacks in writing skills, he makes up for in clever plot twists and gripping codes. I also was drawn to the subject matter, amazed that \\"everything\\" (in Brown's words during an interview) was true.<br />A little research quickly showed that, while there is a good deal of truth in \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", and much of it is based on fact, the basic premises of the book are said to be absolute fact, when in fact they are no more than speculations based on rumors and oversimplifications of extremely complex stuff.<br />First off, it is generally agreed upon that the Priory of Sion did not in fact exist, but was a hoax invented in the 1950s by a French Nazi named Pierre Plantard in order to proclaim himself the King of France, claiming that he was a direct descendant of Jesus. He made up a bunch of documents on the fictional Priory of Sion and planted them in various libraries. That Dan Brown takes the hoax as truth just shows his gullibility.<br />Second, I really don't think you can say that women experienced something of a Golden Age before Christianity, and then, as Christianity was popularized, automatically became subservient. Although there were certain branches of paganism (not one unified religion, but various local traditions) that worshipped various goddesses, women certainly were not prominent in society - they have always been discriminated against, and there have been few female leaders throughout history, before and after the rise of Christianity. Nor can one claim that Jesus was never considered divine until after the Council of Nicaea - even if he was declared such during that council (which he wasn't, not exactly), there were always followers of Jesus that considered him such.<br />My real problem with this book lies in Brown's assertions that it is all fact, when so much of it is inaccurate or oversimplified. I was also really annoyed by his making the main character a Harvard professor who was an expert in his field, when Brown is obviously nowhere near that status. I hate that so many people are reading The Da Vinci Code and accepting it as fact.hat women experienced something of a Golden Age before Christianity, and then, as Christianity was popularized, automatically became subservient.

B00005TT77|3.0|I love  the beatles, and i think this CD could have been better.  The best song is let is be by nick cave, closely followed by strawberry fields forever by ben harper and then blackbird by sarah maclaughlin and you've got to hide your love away by eddie vedder.  The other songs are forgettable.  Fiona Apple does a good version of across the universe that i would have like to have seen on here.
B0000DD7LB|3.0|While I do not appreciate Britney Spears for who she is, I can say this, this is one of her better albums. As she moves away from her bubble gum phase, Britney experiments with different sounds, adding her unique voice to these tracks. Compared to the last few albums I bought in the past 4 months, this one ranks near the top. The music seems different, as now of days when you listen to newer artists, you find each of their songs blending into the next. This made the album very refreshing! For those of you who find themselves being caught up in the dance craze, this will be an album for you!<br />Like every album there are a few rough spots that never quite fit in, and this album has those too. You will find a few slow tracks that just don't fit into the album no matter how you look at it, and that's ok! When you enjoy 10 out of 13 tracks you can't exactly claim that the Cd sucks. So give it a listen, I hope it doesn't disappoint.<br />The Hidden Gems Of The Record: The Hook Up, Brave Girl, and (I Got That) Boom Boom.
B0000039PW|5.0|Yeah basically on this album Biggie Snaps. Its one of the best hardcore albums youll hear. The intro track is kinda dumb until the end when biggie says \\"i gotta big plans, big plans\\" then you hear the album. It actually makes some sense. all the songs on this album are great, except for the sex scene which is just useless but can be skipped. i think the most hardcore song on is here and probably the best is gimmie the loot, biggie's voice is just so loud and he is almost yelling on it. Juicy, Big Poppa, Everyday Struggle are basically the best songs on here. One disappointment is the absence of the remix version of one more chance, but he regaular version on here is till pretty good too and the skit in the beginning is actually kind of funny. The what is a song i dont really care for but its alright you can listen to it atleast. the lyrics are really strong on this album as well, biggie has knack for story telling in his raps, which can be seen on Warning and Everyday struggle. Biggie just snaps on here and really doesnt care what he says, like \\"i dont give a f*** if you pregant, you need a babyrings and number one mom pendant.\\" there are basically no guests on this album which is great cause biggie is the only one we want to hear anywayz. a rap classic you wont be disappointed
B00005ASGG|5.0|Most like to think of this one as a John Wayne/Jimmy Stewart classic (both of whom are splendid in the movie), forgetting the wonderful part that Marvin played as the sinister gunman, Liberty Valance.  More than his role in CAT BALLOU I believe that this film truly showcases Marvin's abilities as a western actor.<br />THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE, a John Ford western classic, tells the story of Ransom Stoddard (Stewart), an eastern lawyer come west at the behest of the legendary Horace Greeley (Go west, young man...).  Looking for an idyllic paradise where law and order could flourish Stoddard finds, instead, a wild country governed by the good and the bad (some ugly) with intimidation and guns.<br />The best of the good is a man name Tom Doniphon (Wayne) who befriends Stoddard despite the interest his girlfriend, Hallie (played by Vera Miles) shows in the newcomer.  Doniphon looks to the future while accepting the fact that in order to survive at the time a gun and a willingness to use it is mandatory.<br />Prairie politics lead to violence as Liberty Valance plies his deadly trade as a hired gun.  When Stoddard seemingly keeps Valance from being elected as a territorial delegate to the state convention Valance calls Stoddard out.  Who will win the gunfight?  The &quot;dude&quot; lawyer who is determined to stick it out and without a gun?  Or will the ornery hired gun have his way?  And who gets the girl? Who did shoot Liberty Valance after all?  You'll have to watch this one and find out.<br />A great supporting cast includes Edmond O'Brien (THE WILD BUNCH), Andy Devine (famous for his voice in Disney cartoons), John Carradine (THE SHOOTIST), and Woody Strode (ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST).<br />THE HORSEMAN
B00018D44U|3.0|I found Norah's second album to be an extension of her first- the same slow swaying, subtle music that you like to hear at cafes. If you liked the first one, you'll like the second. (Note: you can tell them apart by the different album cover color. The first one is blue, and the second is yellow...very considerate, if you ask me.) I would NOT say it is jazz, it is more like a modern, quiet version of country and blues. The merit of her music is that you don't have to think, you can just turn your brain off and let it rest. If that is art, then I rest my case. <br />The title &quot;Feels like home&quot; couldn't have been better. It is exactly that. Feels like home. Lying on the couch with a glass of wine. Getting drunk and sleepy. More sleepy. and... more... slee.. py... Until suddenly a bright springy country number on track 7 jerks you up from dozing. This cruel number spoils everything and wakes you up so you can listen to the rest of the album.

You really don't need a review for this cause metalheads around the world know hw great this album is. But for those of you morons who know nothing about metal and need a review, here goes:<br />1. The music is pretty much heavy ass, in our face, thrash/speed metal. Some of the some have groove in them, but other than that, most of the songs, with the exception of the classics Angel of Death and Raining Blood, are 2 minute speed fests.<br />2. One must applaud Dave Lombardo! One of the most influencial drummers in metal, or in music after all. Just listen to \\"Angel of Death,\\" where he does some sick double bass work, especially in the chorus. Easily puts Benate and Ulrich to shame<BR>with his drum work.<br />3. Hanneman and King solo till it hurts. Just listen to the solos in \\"Jesus Saves.\\" Nuff said.<br />4. The lyrics are filled with Satanic references. With songs about the holocaust (\\"Angel of Death\\") or death (\\"Altar of Sacrifice\\"), Tom makes yor spine chill when he says \\"ENTER TO THE REALM OF SATAN!!\\"<br />Like I said earlier, there's really no need to review this classic, cause you probably already know how great it is. But if you're just getting into metal, definitely pick this fxcker up. You'll thank me later.
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I'll admit it took a few listens to get me into this album, but once I did, I found myself loving every song on it. The guitar tone Petrucci uses is just awesome, and Portnoy is a sweet drummer. I really think this is worth picking up.
0671798154|5.0|This book never got slow or lost my interest.  It reminded me of Ken Follet's THE KEY TO REBECCA.  I finished this book late on night and even had a dream about the characters - they were so real!  You must read this book if you enjoyed books such as THE EAGLE HAS LANDED, etc.
0385510438|1.0|If you're looking for the typical Grisham \\"thriller\\", this is not the book.  The Last Juror is disappointing at best!  The story that is outlined on the book jacket takes more than one third of the book to unfold.  In other words, the book jacket told us the same thing that a full one third of the book told us.  The second third is barely readable!  It has absolutely nothing to do with the plot.  The book is certainly not what the reader is looking for when reading a Grisham novel.  <br />Grisham has indeed earned the financial freedom to discover other genre's, but I wish the publisher wouldn't try to fool the reader into thinking this is another legal thriller.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|One of the most thoughtful and beautiful movies I've seen in the past year. Coppola is clearly an observant writer and director. There are several little fascinating, yet unexplained observations of life in modern Japan (the traditional wedding party and the Tokyo video arcade are good examples). These scenes are engaging because we are also engaged by the two main characters who are stumbling through this strange world, even as they are discovering a soul mate in each other.<br />The photography is beautiful. One of my favorite compositions is a shot of Murray driving a golf ball off a tee with a beautiful mountain backdrop (Mt. Fuji maybe?) In another eye-filling scene, Johansson meanders through a park filled with ribboned trees, and stepping stone ponds. Scenic nature is nice, but even better is the urban atmosphere of Tokyo. Both the interior and exterior shots are interestingly composed and lit. The hotel and taxi scenes were evocative, reminding me of Polanski's &quot;Frantic&quot;, another jet-lagged, fish-out-of-water movie. (The only scene I could have done without was strip club scene, but it was mercifully short.)<br />There is great writing and acting as well. There are interesting read-between-the-lines conversations several times; like when Murray meets a couple American businessmen in the hotel bar. And the unspoken expressive acting between the two when they go out for a silent lunch after he disappoints her was also very well done. If you like dialogue and character development, this movie's for you. <br />Since the two main characters comment often about not being able to sleep, it's tempting to call the movie `Sleepless in Tokyo'. But while I like the Seattle movie, the similarities aren't that many. It's just a good pun. Why this movie is categorized as a comedy I'm not sure. Murray is very funny, but in an understated way. And the movie is much deeper than most comedies I see. Maybe I'm just biased against the word `comedy' because so many of them don't appeal to my taste. This movie appealed to me in so many ways. I heartily recommend it.
B000127LW2|4.0|Star Trek creates an alternate universe, a place where you can let your imagination run wild and Voyager is no different. This series took an entirely different approach and chose to do away with the familiar. No Cardasians, no romulans and no Alpha quadrant. This threw a huge spanner in the works for who, in the history of Star Trek, had ever heard of an entire series taking place out of the familiar? At the same time this allowed the creative juices to flow at Paramount and allowed for the creation of new species and new worlds to discover. <br />In ST Voyager you follow the crew on their journey home, you witness their trials and tribulations and sometimes you just can't help but feel like you're there with them. <br />I think first time Star Trek viewers are at an advantage here as there is no initial shock to get over in terms of removal from the familiar. You can jus pick it up from scratch and enjoy. Seasoned fans will enjoy as the series progresses. A mixed and rebellious crew is not something that you will take easily in the beginning however give it time and Voyager will surely grow on you.

0440237688|5.0|The Giver is one of those books that you don't ever want to put down. The reader will get easily engrossed in the story, wanting to know what is going to happen next. This novel teaches people to be more appreciative of everything they have in their world. There are so many every day things that no one even pays attention to and take for granted. But after reading The Giver, your mind is opened up to how terrible life could be if the simplest things were taken away. For example our free will and our differences; without them we'd live in \\"Sameness\\" as the community in The Giver does. This book has been one of my favorites for the past 4 years, and every time I read it it's like I'm reading it for the first time again. It is a truly remarkable book.

B00005JMJ4|1.0|People, most of the critics of this movie still don't get it.  Maybe Lost in Translation is a bit slow,... so what.  My beef with this movie is the portrayal of the Japanese.  It's like they're in the movie for the main actors' amusement.  So what if they get the &quot;L's&quot; and &quot;R's&quot; switched around.  Did you ever think that it's cuz English isn't their native language?  How many times did the main characters make attempts at speaking Japanese?  It's just another racist film trying to paint a picture of the &quot;superiority&quot; of white Amerikkkans.  I hope that if any of you see this movie and get inspired to travel to Japan that you won't act like a bunch of bigotted clowns.

B0000AXE8I|4.0|If I had written this review the first time I watched this movie, I would have probably given it 2 stars. I was hugely disappointed, and noone can make an argument that this is as good as the original.  Too many cliches, too much of a romance, too much over-acting.  But, after watching it a 2nd and then a 3rd time, the movie is actually not so bad. Incredible graphics, great action scenes and the story (after you learn to not focus on the bad acting and the nonsense scenes) is very thought provoking.  For this alone, it was worth buying the DVD.
0767836286|5.0|The hook is set right out of the chute in the harrowing opening scene, brilliantly enacted by both Bridges & young Mason Gamble. From there on it keeps you guessing. Right up to the end, you're guessing wrong. Repeated viewings are still enjoyable even once you know the twist. I like a movie that (for a change) you can't figure out.<BR>This is a very good movie with a great cast, excellent acting in virtually all roles. Well written, well directed & put together. <BR>I borrowed this movie from a friend, having never heard of it prior. I really didn't want to give it back. Since I have purchased my own copy.  I highly recommend it and the several of my friends I've loaned it to have also enjoyed it.
B00004TL21|5.0|White Pony is an amazing album and every song is brilliant but is unlike any of deftones previous work.  As with most deftones albums I wasnt that keen on it at first because it was just so different to all other metal bands at the time like limp bizkit but if you stick with it you will understand what I mean. White Pony has very few 'heavy' songs and no raping at all and so may be a dissaointment to early fans but as usual chinos vocals are incredible.  He sings brilliantly on songs like Feiticeira, Kinife Prty and the amazingly atmouspheric Change in the house of flies.  The album is very eclectic (one minute having a quiet, emotional song and the next virtualy a death metal song) and so I wouldnt recoment to every one but I think if you have a varied taste you will like it.

B0000VAFO0|3.0|Everyone will talk about the age old war between Lycans and Vampires waged in Underworld.  Some mention how the film is a mélange of different ideas and techniques.  One point that does seem to be overlooked is why these critters did not just call themselves Garou and Kindred as most gaming fans would recognize.  In a sense, this is just one game session set on film and given music in the background.  It sounds as if people feel that this has all been done before, and in a sense, it probably has.  The idea of vampires forming small groups to try and stave off the onslaught of werewolves, who really are more powerful in the World of Darkness (from White Wolf games) is quite traditional.  So many of the points brought out that seem to contradict classic folklore falls almost perfectly with the World of Darkness.  Only the idea of Lycans as immortal is out of line.<br />So... where does this movie fall?  It seems to be a shorter, theatrical version of Kindred the Embraced but with the mean old Garou err... Lycans added.  Heck... after all the whole movie is simply about how to make an Abomination.  AND, that Abomination should have handed any elder his ancient, withered rump.

B000089CJI|5.0|There seem to be indie garage rock and emo bands proliferating at a near-alarming rate these days, many of whom are producing rather solid and wonderful albums.  Often though, the three guitar and drum set arrangements with warbling off-key vocals that many of these bands share all seem to run together after a while, making many of these bands hard to differentiate from each other. That's what makes the Postal Service a welcome change or pace, as they play rock music but with sampled computer blips, drum-and-bass syncopation, synths, strings, and instrument simulations filling in the background rather than just a wall of guitar and drum noise. The lyrics are very smart, incisive and powerful, yet subtle.  This album combines some of the best elements of indie rock/emo and electronica.  Easily one of the best albums I've purchased this year.
B000001ESP|5.0|A lot of people go into raptures over &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; and why not -- it is without a doubt the most complete Rush album and if you were going to own only one album of their music, you could certainly not do much better (save for a live album).<br />It encompasses the gamut of the band's persona, musically and lyrically. We all know &quot;Tom Sawyer&quot; as a modern rock anthem, &quot;Limelight&quot; as a peek into the world up on the stage, and &quot;YYZ&quot; as the ultimate power rock instrumental. We take another science-fictional journey in &quot;Red Barchetta&quot; and get in touch with our world through &quot;The Camera Eye&quot; and &quot;Witch Hunt&quot;. &quot;Vital Signs&quot; is my favorite Ruch tune (and I was so glad the live board bootleg of it ends &quot;Live in Rio&quot;) for its message and its rich sound.<br />Rather than continue the effusive praise which others have done more adequately than I can, let me just say that &quot;Moving Pictures&quot; bring us as close to heart of this band as any of their works. You see it in Neil's writing, Alex's virtuoso axework, and Geddy's driving base-line. This album personifies the trio's interconnectedness and the fusion that is created when they come together as Rush. Each is among the most talented at his instrument; Neil I think gets the most credit as the excellent drummer he is, but Geddy is one of the best bassists of all time and Alex takes to the guitar work with a passion that belies technical excellence. When they unite, the result is astonishing, and nowhere is that more true than in this album.<br />Enough boosterism... do yourself a favor... pick up this album, put on a good set of headphones, and feel the power for yourself...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A throught provoking setting that is rechly embellished with background, character and intrigue. I enjoyed finding all the parallels inherent in an antebellum sci-fi western. Excellent writing and no techno speak or meson of the week gibberish. Just well though out plots that are threaded, a continuous narrative that explores people in their varietal selves. A worthwhile expense in a genre that needs more good shows. Warning, you may become addicted to this, and there is only one season.
0714843377|4.0|This book is a very simple book with a powerful message. You can probably finish reading the entire book in 20 minutes. However, the lessons that are taught in this book are quite memorable. Each &quot;chapter&quot; contains a life lesson in a very succinct and graphic format. Each lesson probably has less than 10 sentences long but i must confess the lessons really stick in your mind and i often find myself revisiting it again whenever self-doubts arise. It's definitely worth checking out.
B000002IZ4|5.0|Stone Temple Pilots - Purple (1994)<br /><br />I was continually immersed in PURPLE when it came out. Their second album, it's a bit trippier with more of a psychedelic feel than CORE, their first one, although it totally rocks as well. I thought it was the best for years, although I've recently gone back to thinking CORE is slightly better.<br /><br />My favorite track is the morbid testament of love that is \\"Still Remains\\" although the hits \\"Vasoline\\" and \\"Big Empty\\" are even better. \\"Interstate Love Song,\\" probably their biggest hit, is an instant classic. My least favorite is \\"Pretty Penny,\\" an acoustic number that just doesn't hit the right notes for me, sounding borderline atonal. That's not counting the joke song \\"12 Gracious Melodies\\" that closes the album and finds singer Scott Weiland in lounge lizard territory to hilarious effect. All the other songs are top notch heavy rock. STP write (wrote) killer songs and that's what sets them above so many other bands who play this kind of music.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the band hasn't been able to consistently get it together in subsequent years like they did on PURPLE. Their next album, TINY MUSIC...  took some glam turns that were a bit too derivative and unconvincing. Weiland's lyrics got a bit cliched as well. In later years, STP continued to make some great music, but CORE and PURPLE remain their masterpieces.
0066620996|4.0|Speaking of Great companies, great books seem to come from either of two directions:  experience or research.  I find those written from experience provide a street-level insight that can't be achieved by research.  Surely one can write more authoritatively from experience than from learning something and then reformatting it.  That said, Good to Great is thoroughly researched, and still comes up with fundamental, 'street-level' conclusions that are worthwhile.<br />Early on, two Great points are made that carry on throughout the book:  Great leaders are self-effacing, and Great leaders tend to come from within, a fact which flies in the face of the current trend to buy talent (and thus market share in the taking).<br />The layout of the book is a little dis-jointed with subsections and bullets, but chapter summaries lend back to the organization.  Overall, a Great book that, through lots of research and maybe an overly detailed presentation, illustrates Greatness usually comes through adherance to the most basic principles.  Read it to find out what they are.<br />W. F. Depp
B000002L9J|5.0|The Smiths is the coolest possible name for a band because instead of going for the weirdest, wildest name they chose the most common, ordinary name around and made it cool. Also, many could identify with the image of everyday people with common problems that the name represented for some.<br />I probably shouldn't let on just how much this album meant to me as a floundering teen in the 80's so I won't. I just feel vindicated that it's now commonly considered to be the best Smiths album because I used to argue with a friend about it who thought MEAT IS MURDER to be the best. (While it has some great moments, that album would be my last choice).<br />This band really stirs some passionate feelings in people! Morrisey is indeed the Leper Messiah for the alienated, the shy, the ordinary, the depressed, the losers, the outsiders . . . he's also wickedly funny! And, of course, Johnny Marr is a certifiable guitar hero, king of the jangly melody.<br />Instead of trying to describe this music to you, allow me to give you a taste of Morrisey's lyrics from each song:<br />&quot;Life is very long when you're lonely&quot; - &quot;The Queen is Dead&quot;<br />&quot;I want to catch something that I might be ashamed of&quot; - &quot;Franky Mr. Shankly&quot;<br />&quot;Oh Mother, I can feel the soil falling over my head&quot; - &quot;I Know It's Over&quot;<br />&quot;I had a really bad dream/ It lasted 20 years, 7 months and 27 days&quot; - &quot;Never Had No One Ever&quot;<br />&quot;All those people all those lives, where are they now?&quot; - &quot;Cemetary Gates&quot;<br />&quot;Sweetness, I was only joking when I said I'd like to smash every tooth in your head&quot; - &quot;Bigmouth Strikes Again&quot;<br />&quot;Behind the hatred there lies/ A murderous desire for love&quot; - &quot;The Boy with the Thorn in his Side&quot;<br />&quot;The fabric of a tutu/ Any man could get used to/ And I am a living sign.&quot; - &quot;Vicar in a Tutu&quot;<br />&quot;If a double-decker bus/ Crashes into us/ To die by your side/ Is such a heavenly way to die&quot; - &quot;There Is a Light That Never Goes Out&quot;<br />&quot;Some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers&quot; - &quot;Some Girls are Bigger than Others&quot;<br />An aside: I saw them for the Queen is Dead tour (Bronco Bowl - Ft. Worth). My friends and I bribed our way onto the floor which was an open pit in front of the stage. It quickly became a mosh pit, but not the kind where you knock people around. This moshing was more like a writhing mass of love, love from people brought together by a mutual adoration of the Smiths who were fantastic that night. It was the most fun I've ever had at a concert (with the exception of the Grateful Dead -!) and I still have an old jacket in the back of my closet with a strip from Morrisey's shirt on it./ Crashes into us/ To die by your side/ Is such a heavenly way to die&quot; - &quot;There Is a Light That Never Goes Out&quot;<br />&quot;Some girls' mothers are bigger than other girls' mothers&quot; - &quot;Some Girls are Bigger than Others&quot;<br />An aside: I saw them for the Queen is Dead tour (Bronco Bowl - Ft.

B000001ESJ|5.0|a farewell to kings is defanetly one of rush'es best best albums ever. it starts out with the song a farewell to kings wich is very good. then is xanadu probably the best song on the album. it has a mystic feel and will alex lifesons excelet guitar, geddy lee's melodic bass and vocals, and neil purts percision drumming this is truly one of my favorite rush songs. the third track closer to the heart is a rush clasic. the fourth track cinderella man tells of a rich man with a good will. not as long of a song as i would like but still very good.<BR>the fith song madrigal is strange but has a slow mellow feel. its one of those songs that you just with would go forever.<BR>the last song cygnus x-1 is strange but very good and is a good way to finish off a perfict album. this album is defenatly worth 5 stars. if u like 70's and 80's rush you will love this album(all rush is worht getting tho).
B00005JLYW|1.0|If you think the first one was bad, Charlie's Angels - Full Throttle takes the cake. Nothing worth mentioning in this review other than to hope that this is the last movie in the series. <br />Really, really bad.
B0000AR8NK|4.0|There is a common thread running through all the Reality customer reviews that I have so far read. Everybody immediately trawls through David's back catalogue, minutely comparing Reality with their own favourite Bowie record from the past. It becomes quite obvious after a while that there is no accounting for taste. While some, for instance, love Outside/Earthling, others abhor David's work from this era. The only conclusion that can be drawn is that a man who is responsible for such an eclectic output over such a lengthy period of time cannot please all of the people all of the time. Herein lies the rub. Where does Reality fit in the scheme of all things Bowie? Well, why bother trying to pigeonhole it with Scary Monsters, or Low, or Hours? Let it stand on its own merits! Give it its own hole!Approaching Reality as if it were the first time I'd ever heard Bowie, I found an interesting, edgy rock album, framed with novel beats and anchored by a dynamic, versatile, powerful vocal presence that sounds like none other on this planet. Why care if it doesn't contain a &quot;Hello Spaceboy&quot; or a &quot;Life On Mars&quot; or a &quot;China Girl&quot;? Reality has its own jewels that may or may not find their place on a &quot;Best of Bowie&quot; compilation in 100 years time. For cripes sake, just sit down and enjoy the record! It's really rather good, even if you think it lacks the industrial punch of Outside or the melodic virtue of Hunky Dory. Would you rather have Moaning Bleating or Enrique I-greasy-arse in your player?<br />A more personal note on which to finish: if David's passing through a venue near you on his A Reality tour, don't miss him! A couple of hours of his current show quickly puts to death any ideas that he's an arthritic has-been gasping his way towards the tail-end of his career. The guy's no mere rock star, he's a phenomenon.
B000002H97|2.0|this album sucks and they went downhill after this. avoid.
B000003TA4|5.0|In the height of the Hair Metal craze, out comes this album from some unknown band from Seattle that instead of talking about partying and having fun, complains about life. This album is about 70% responsible for killing hair metal. The album had so many new sounding songs and everyone bought this on tape. Here's how the songs are rated.<br />Smells Like Teen Spirit 10/10- THE song that defined the grunge movement. Great song even if most of the lyrics are unintelligible.<br />In Bloom 10/10- A song if released as a single would be almost as popular as &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit.&quot; Great vocals by Cobain.<br />Come As You Are 10/10- The other hit single was not as popular, but by no means is any worse. This one is not as overplayed as &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; and is more likeable with memorable bass riffs.<br />Breed 9/10- Pretty good song even though not as memorable as the first three. Lyrics are hard to understand, though.<br />Lithium 10/10 Nirvana at its best.<br />After this though, the album is all crappy songs, some filler, none memorable. From the beginning of &quot;Polly&quot; anyone can tell that the rest is awful. This still gets five stars because the first five songs are soooo amazing. Too bad that even though this album would change rock forever, and it's so good, it wound up being worse for rock than if it had stayed with Hair Metal for ten more years. There have been almost no good artists that have started after this album came out. Too bad.
B000099T2L|2.0|I was really looking forward to this CD.  But man was I not happy when I listened to the whole thing.  I really like the 2 radio plays, &quot;Crazy in Love&quot; and &quot;Baby Boy&quot;.  But nothing else really sounded that great to me.  I especially don't like the &quot;Me, Myself, and I&quot; cut, which is now on MTV.  &quot;naughty girl&quot; got me intrigued with the intro, but killed itself with repetitive junk.  I really wanted more from Beyonce'.  I love her musical style, and her voice is fabulous.  I just think she tried too hard with this one.
B000000OSE|4.0|Assuming that Guns N' Roses had gone with their first instinct and used all of their good songs for one Use Your Illusion album, it would have been the greatest album of all time (All of the songs from Use Your Illusion I and II were written at the same time). Instead greed got the best of them and they made it into two albums, the gaps filled with filler songs (What's really funny is that they eventually made a Use Your Illusion album, a combination of both albums, and they left off half of the good songs). Here are the ratings for the songs.<BR>1. Right Next Door to Hell 9/10- Pretty good song to start out. Good guitar solo.<BR>2. Dust N' Bones 10/10- Awesome song written and sung by Izzy. He sounds great on lead vocals and guitar. Also a great guitar solo by Slash. Songs like this were overlooked and never appreciated. Heavy guitars along with Axl on piano and those great pounding vocals are a trademark of the Use Your Illusion albums and no songs will ever be made again as unique and good as this one.<BR>3. Live and Let Die 5/10- Awful remake of the Wings classic. Fairly big hit for some reason.<BR>4. Don't Cry 10/10- Sappy and overplayed, but still a great song. Great guitar solo by Slash.<BR>5. Perfect Crime 7/10- Fast paced, profanity-laced, short song. Good guitar solo by Slash saves it.<BR>6. You Ain't the First 2/10- Awful filler.<BR>7. Bad Obsession 3/10- More awful filler.<BR>8. Back Off B*tch 6/10- If this was an instumental it could get an 8 or a 9, but the lyrics are so profane and offensive, it ruins the song.<BR>9. Double Talkin' Jive 10/10- Short but likeable with two great solos by Slash, one with electric and one with classic guitar.<BR>10. November Rain 10/10- Sappy, long, and overplayed, it is still a good song and is impossible not to be moved by Slash's guitar solo at the end.<BR>11. Garden of Eden 4/10- Filler at best, not even a voice cameo by Alice Cooper can save this one.<BR>12. The Garden 2/10- More filler, almost completely worthless.<BR>13. Don't Damn Me 7/10- Axl spews out hatred for many things including organized religion, the lyrics can be appreciated by some, but may offend others.<BR>14. One Bad Apple 6/10- Okay song influenced by the Osmonds' song with the same name.<BR>15. Dead Horse 8/10- Pretty good song, but can be annoying at times. That's Axl on acoustic guitar at the beginning. <BR>16. Coma 10/10- Possibly the best song on the album, it is over ten minutes long. Great perfomances all around, but especially Slash. Slash has another great guitar solo (noticing a pattern?) and great lyrics by Axl.<BR>This album still gets five stars because there are so many good songs on here. The best thing to do if you own the two albums is to use a CD burner and put your favorite songs from both albums on to one CD and make your own Use Your Illusion, because it is impossible to listen through this entire album (unless you have a CD) because there is so much crap mixed in with the good songs.
B0000399WI|5.0|Every time I grow annoyed with Tim Robbins' politics I pop this DVD in or catch it on TNT for the 2,000th time.<br />There is not one single flawed performance in this beautiful Stephen King adaptation.  From Gil Bellows (who deserves stardom after landing the role of Tommy after Brad Pitt turned it down) to the tragic James Whitmore, ever-versatile Clancy Brown (who turned up to voice a dragon in the Cartoon Network series &quot;Samurai Jack&quot;), sinister Bob Gunton...and who can ever possibly forget the King of Hank Williams lovesick blues singin', multitalented and underrated veteran actor William Sadler, recently seen in the equally underrated &quot;The Battle of Shaker Heights&quot; and soon to play in the anticipated &quot;Wonderfalls&quot; dramedy on Fox?<br />I love this movie and its observations on life, love, justice, and yes, redemption.  Some have criticized Warden Norton's character as Hollywood's continued assault on religion.  As Mel Gibson's PASSION OF THE CHRIST will undoubtedly prove, yes, atrocities have been committed in the name of religion, concealing human ambition.  I can think of no better argument for Christ in this film than Andy DuFresne and Red.  And lest we forget, Morgan Freeman played God in BRUCE ALMIGHTY.
6302798450|5.0|REVIEW BY NICK EVANGELISTA:<BR>To me, this is one of the best pokes at the &quot;real man's adventure&quot; genre that goes back to those lurid magazine of the 40s, 50s, ansd 60s, where the shirtless hero is always traped in some hideous prediciment with a half naked woman.<br />Bruce Campbell has perfected the delivery of the over-the-top hero, Ash, and there is no one in Hollywood who could do the part with more gusto. With a chainsaw strapped to his arm, and a &quot;boomstick&quot; to his back, he stumbles through one overblown, blood-gushing adventure to a another. <br />In my opinion, this is the best entry in the &quot;EVIL DEAD&quot; series.<br />By the way, has anyone else noticed the similarity to this film and Mark Twain's &quot;A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court&quot;?
B00008CLOA|5.0|Pink Floyd is probably one of my most favorite bands. Despised by pop lovers and adored by many, Dark Side of the Moon has amazed the world and me. I was immediatly hooked. To see such a classic go into the new world of technology and changed so that it sounds better is great for me! After listening to this cd and comparing it to the original DSOTM, it was startling. The chines in &quot;Time&quot;, the chachings in &quot;Money&quot;, the silky keyboards in &quot;Breathe&quot; it just all fitted together into an amazing album for a new generation of listenings. Highly recommended.
B000001EKX|4.0|This album has much better energy,compositions and arrangements than dressed to kill.The sound quality on this remastered edition is not as bad as the original release and does not need to be as crisp as dressed to kill in order to be a better album.The only better Kiss albums are rock n'roll over ,destroyer and possibly the debut.Although the latter is a matter of taste.
B000002A3T|4.0|I am not a newcomer. I own the classics of Pink Floyd such as &quot;The Wall&quot; &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; &quot;Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; &quot;Animals&quot; and many more. Yet Division Bell was very surprising. After having a huge downfall after Walters left, I thought that my favorite band was done for. Yet, here comes the Division Bell, with hits such as the intrumental &quot;Marooned&quot; and &quot;Coming Back to Life&quot; The album even starts amazing with &quot;Cluster One&quot;. With some little lows &quot;Keep Talking&quot; and &quot;What Do You Want From Me&quot;, it still ends magnificent with &quot;High Hopes&quot; which is probably my favorite song out of the whole album. Floyd fans who think this album is horrible should be ashamed of themselves. Its not &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; but it still captures my attention and I can't help listening to it again and again. Very good album.
B000002A3T|3.0|I gave this 3 stars because it is still Pink Floyd.  There are some interesting songs and music here, but it is just Momentary Lapse rehashed.  There is nothing here that stands out or is up to Floyd's usual high standards.  I know that the Floyd Faithful are always going to 5 star everything, but beware of this one.  There are much better Floyd albums out there.  I don't really see the need to own this if you already have Momentary Lapse.  Buy Animals, Dark Side, Wish You Were Here, or The Wall.  I would even recommend Delicate Sound of Thunder instead of this.  To each his own, but this one wasn't for me.
B00005YW4H|1.0|What a boring album! And this one got so many grammys and has sold in millions all over the world?! Oh, my Lord! That make me anxious. What a music taste people have! I just can't believe it! And I am not that kind of person that only like Limp Bizkit, Marilyn Manson etc. I like both pop, synth, rock, hard rock and Enya but definitely not Norah Jones!
B00005B36H|4.0|Although my favorite album is Aenema this comes in 2nd place. BUt Lateralus has something all the other albums does not have. ORchestration! This MUSIC WILL PUT YOU IN A VOID, if you like it that is. IT incorporates all instruments well, especially drums because Danny(drummer) admit himself that this is meant to be drum driven, so with that said, take a listen to Lateralus and be appaled by their orchestrations and NOTE TO ANY DRUMMERS, IF YOU HAVE NOT LISTENED TO TOOL YET, GET THIS ALBUM and ANEMA and YOU WILL SEE WHO THE BEST DRUMMER OF OUR GENERATION REALLY IS!!!!!! IF Beethoven were to come back from the grave and collaborate he would defenitely call TOOL!!!!!!
B00005AQGH|5.0|If you think twice about buying this cd, you've already thought too long. This is the quintessential rap album and will likely never be topped by another rap cd ever. By far this cd is Tupac's pivotal point as a rapper, person, and political figure. If you buy one cd in your lifetime, this MUST be it.
B00000099Y|5.0|TOOL is undeniably one of the best bands of our time.  i could not believe seeing these 1-star reviews... TOOL is not for all people including metalheads because it uses more abstract lyrics and the complaints i have heard is that the introduction to some songs are too long as well. This cd is arguably TOOL's best release up to date. Some of these songs grew on me immediatly ,and some i found growing on me even a year after buying the album... try reading some lyrics, the songs do make alot more sense... those who say TOOL is not hard must listen to that incoherent death metal that i cant even understand. Maynard's voice is an extremely unique, and melodic and i cannot of anyone who could ever possibly replace him. this cd is definetly in my top 10 of all time. i reccomend this to anyone who LISTENS to rock music

B00005A46T|3.0|Alright, we've established it.  This album is not death metal.  It's not even that good.  Slipknots major debut took chances and was refreshing and entertaining.  It was also admittedly nu-metal.  Like it or not that is a valid music genre with many varied bands that some of you lump into your beloved black/death metal.  Hatebreed, Shadows Fall, Killswitch Engage.... all exhibit more nu-metal characteristics than d/m.  As for this album, it falls short on creativity but is a little heavier.  It seems as though the art was lost in translation.  Well, its all a moot point as all these bands, respective of their individual talents, bow to the almighty TOOL.  It's just the way of things. Accept it. Start new arguments...............NOW!!!!!
B00005JMJ4|4.0|OK - bear with me for a moment:  When two similar waveforms interfere with each other, there are two extremes of effect.  In one, the waveforms are &quot;in phase&quot; - that is, their peaks occur at the same time and their troughs occur at the same time.  In the other extreme (out of phase), one wave's peak occurs at the same location (or time) as another wave's trough.  The effect of combining the &quot;in phase&quot; waves is addition - the amplitudes of the peaks are added together, thus greater than either one.  This is commonly called &quot;resonance.&quot;  When the equal amplitude out-of-phase waves are added together, they cancel each other out.  This is known as &quot;destructive interference.&quot;<br />I bring this up because this is what happens to viewers of &quot;Lost in Translation.&quot;  If you are in phase with this movie - by personal experiences, then the low-key bemusement will strike a familiar chord.  If you have never had the experience of living out of a hotel - particularly a hotel in a non-English-speaking country, then this movie will probably strike you as extremely dull, and you ought to avoid it.<br />For those of you in the first camp - this movie connects at a fundamental level.  The &quot;hotel lighting&quot;, background music, dimly lit lounges, exotic glimpses of day-to-day life all bring back memories not only of Japan, but of any country or place in which you are the alien.  The amazing thing is that Coppola accomplishes this without making the movie depressing.  While the specifics of the plot certainly weren't personally familiar, the context of the movie makes the plot somewhat irrelevant.<br />Murray &amp; Johansson are most accomplished in their blending in: neither character stands out from the context of the movie.  Both are intrinsic to their settings.  And the effect of this is to make the separation of the two that much more affecting.<br />A marvelous, understated and powerful movie.  But don't bother unless you're on the same wavelength.on the same wavelength.
B00018D44U|4.0|I have to say that I agonised for ages over whether to buy this CD, given the mix of reviews I read on here first. After reading over 100 people's opinions on here, I was more undecided than to begin with. Chances are that if you came here looking for enlightenment, you're just as confused as I was this time yesterday.    Well, I took myself off to my local CD store to make up my own mind and listen before buying (the sound clips on Amazon really don't give an accurate depiction of the CD, I feel). I very quickly decided I would buy it on the strength of 2 or 3 songs, which is more or less what I did with Come Away With Me. I bought her first album before she won all the awards and was getting airplay, and I didn't take to everything instantly but it did grow on me, so I hoped the same thing would happen second time around.    Granted, I've only had 24 hours to think about it, but I've already come to the conclusion that Feels Like Home is an eminently worthy follow-up album to Come Away With Me. In fact, I'm not sure what I was so worried about. I think the real problem has little to do with Norah Jones and the quality of the music she sings, and more to do with peoples' attempts to categorise her and the songs into different boxes: \\"this one's more country\\", \\"this one has a more blues feel\\", \\"what happened to the jazz?\\" etc. Why should an artist be pigeonholed for the sake of her fans? What it really demonstrates is an inability to be openminded about the musical journey that Norah wishes to share with us. A couple of other reviews have made comments about her trying to be something that she's not, and about her not being in control of her own musical career and being forced in different directions. While I have no evidence to offer either way, isn't it more likely that what these reviewers are really saying is that they're not willing to respect Norah's decision to sing whatever music holds meaning for her and that they'd prefer her to be something she's not?So far my favourite tracks on this album are 'Sunrise' and 'Those Sweet Words', probably because they do have a similar feel to my favourite tracks from her first album. But others that have already struck me as great songs include 'What Am I to You?', 'Carnival Town', 'Toes', 'Humble Me' and 'The Long Way Home'. From what many reviews had said, I was fairly sure I was going to hate the duet with Dolly Parton, but I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, there is a more country and bluegrass influence which I would say is less my thing, but it's really not that bad. Each to his/her own, I say.    Ultimately, this album (as with any music) is best enjoyed if you keep an open mind about it instead of making snap judgments. If you liked Come Away With Me, then I really think this one is worth it: you may love it, you may not, but I honestly think you have nothing to lose by trying.
076781326X|5.0|Like so many other reviewers, this film holds a special place in my life.  Dickens' story is masterfully translated to film and the score adds a whole other level to the charm and power of this story.  It is hard to imagine this story without the musical numbers.  A great addition to any DVD library and sure to entertain generations to come.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Let's get the gripe out of the way first: the trailer. The trailer for this movie cheeses it up and portrays it as some all-American family comedy, but it totally betrays the nature of the film. In fact its a dazzling audiovisual work of art, beautifully told, well acted, with intrigue, appeal and imagination. Scarlett Johanssen's character is so far removed from the average movie heroine that its wonderfully appealing and her journey is sentimental but never cheesy. <br />The film, sometimes just from the cinematography and/or music, can bring out completely inexpressible feelings. Talking of which, the soundtrack is great. Dazzling is a perfect word for it: Tokyo is stunning and alluring. The Japanese jokes can bely the real content of the film and we could possibly do without them, but they're immaterial to the film, really. Classic stuff, one to remember for years to come.
B000068FY1|5.0|Bands may come and go, as does their popularity.  The Jayhawks have managed to stick around despite their relative lack of recognition.  It's unfortunate that they have never had the following they truly deserve.<BR>  <BR>That being said, this is easily of the greatest albums ever made.  This is the Jayhawks at their finest, and although subsequent albums have been tremendous, none quite lives up to Hollywood Town Hall.  You can read descriptions of their 'sound', but it really must be experienced to be appreciated.  So go ahead and hit the &quot;Listen to All&quot; button, or just order it already.  An absolute must for any alt-country fan, but essentially a must for all music fans.

B00005YXZH|1.0|I can not for the life of me figure out what attracts some people to this album.  It is absolutely horrendous.  I (thankfully) borrowed it from my brother-in-law to listen to before I bought it.  That move saved me big time.  Just plain horrible.  I can't put into words my displeasure listening to this.  I tried to sit and focus on the music.  I tried playing it in the background while doing something else.  I put my CD player on random to mix it up with other albums.  Nothing helped.  There are two half decent tracks on this album, with Kamera being one of them.  The rest is half-hearted, thrown together, stumbling annoyance.  Critics jumped on this with good reviews due to it's &quot;eccentric nature&quot;, short-wave radio theme, and the band's trouble getting this album released.  Don't be fooled by them, and avoid it at all costs.
B000003KCU|5.0|I love this movie, but have gone stricktly to DVD's.<BR>When will this be available on DVD???
B00011RPB0|1.0|If you want to appear as though you are artistic then you may wish to recommend this film. On the other hand, if you are honest, you may feel moved to saying that the king has no clothes on. This was an atrocious pile of meaningless pap flapping around for what seemed like an eternity in an attempt to be sensitive and deep. Watching it was the visual version of listening to teenage angst poetry. <br />I came out of the cinema feeling robbed. I find the charge of &quot;If you don't like this film then your not artistic&quot; to be as pretentious as this pathetic excuse of a film. <br />Look, look everybody the king has no clothes
055357342X|3.0|Many praises have been offered here for George R. R. Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series and very much of it is warranted. True, Martin's writing ability is formidable (with one annoying exception detailed below): his story line is complex and packed with a bewildering number of interesting subplots; his characters are on the whole multi-dimensional and his ability to create in the reader an emotional attachment to the characters is well deployed (perhaps too well deployed); and Martin drives the story along, especially in this third part of the ongoing series, with a continuous stream of action scenes that are heavy on the horrible reality of human conflict (and a good smattering of swash-buckling heroic antics).<br />And yet . . . and yet this reader has ultimately been left dissatisfied with the choices Martin has made in the development of the story.<br />Before I get too far into that aspect of things, though, I would like to say a few things about Martin's writing style. After reading a disappointingly long run of poorly crafted and even more poorly edited novels, I find Martin's writing to be refreshing, at least in structure. His prose is generally crisp and concise, allowing for a quick pace unburdened by superfluous ornament. And through this prose we get just enough detail to make his world seem real, its varied terrain well formed in the mind, melding into a consistent and believable whole.<br />However . . . Couldn't you just feel a &quot;however&quot; coming? . . . Because Martin generally constrains his prose to the crisp writing style palatable to the fast-paced taste of modern readers, his insistence--but frustratingly inconsistent--use of pseudo-antiquarian language becomes almost laughable. For example, Martin uses words like &quot;lordling&quot;, &quot;sweetling&quot; and &quot;Ser&quot; (instead of &quot;Sir&quot;), then suddenly includes invectives or slang references to one character or another's private parts that you'd more expect to be coming from a gangsta rapper than a pseudo-medieval knight. This sharp juxtaposition throws a huge stutter into the natural flow of Martin's otherwise fine prose and I found it very annoying.<br />Be that as it may, I have still found this series to be entertaining and full of interesting plots, plots that I can't wait to see developed to their conclusion. I only wish Martin would feel the same way about these plots for, as others have pointed out, like Robert Jordan or Tad Williams, George R. R. Martin seems completely uninterested in bringing his plots to their ultimate conclusion with any rapidity.<br />And here's my major concern with this series: Martin is trying to have his cake and eat it too. Simultaneously, he sets out to write a fantasy/action-adventure AND a historic account of a fictitious world. What's wrong with that? Well, the way Martin writes it, we get a tale with clearly defined good and bad sides (the action-adventure part), but we also get the devastating disappointments that real history too often delivers.<br />Obviously we are supposed to side with the Starks, a family epitomizing the medieval ideals of honor, loyalty and fairness--all that chivalry stuff. Just as clearly, we are supposed to side against the Lannisters who strategize and jostle for political power with supreme Machiavellian prowess, employing unspeakably masochistic minions, spawning incestuous heirs and spitting ceaselessly in the faces of all right thinking people everywhere. And yet, as a historic epic, Martin regularly kills off the characters we have been following as our heroes. Yes, that takes literary guts and it smacks of true history but the actual result is that even halfway through the third novel of the series, the reader is suddenly faced with having to decide AGAIN who the real main character(s) is(are).<br />My conclusion is that there are no main characters in this series because, just like a medieval history, everybody dies in the end. But in a true history there are no clear good guys or clear bad guys and you don't waste time investing emotional energy in empathizing with those you're reading about. And that's the problem. Martin writes so that we DO get attached to the good characters and when he brings them to an untimely end, what we're left with is this awful feeling that everything we've read about them so far has been a complete waste of our time and energy. Obviously none of the ex-main characters are going to end up winning the crown of the Seven Kingdoms, and THAT'S the major plot of the book. So, when a character you've been rooting for since Throne of Kings is suddenly relegated to the status of minor characters, vis-&agrave;-vis their death, who you gonna cheer for?<br />Okay, kudos to George R. R. Martin for writing the first epic fantasy novel since Tolkein's Lord of the Rings that really explores new territory and is completely non-derivative of others' work . . . but you know what? These novels can end up being a whole lot of no fun.<br />In conclusion, though this well-written series is full of interesting plots and characters--and A Storm of Swords is the best part of the series yet--on the whole Songs of Ice and Fire has turned out to be a cloud with a very tarnished silver lining.ere are no clear good guys or clear bad guys and you don't waste time investing emotional energy in empathizing with those you're reading about.

B000002BFZ|5.0|People are so ignorant these days.  Is it just me, or does the entire world get more stupid with each passing day?  Seriously, when a CD like this comes along, and it's called &quot;weak&quot;, and talked of as a &quot;letdown&quot; ...it's just ridiculous.  C'mon people.  Brains aren't just for show... they can also be an excellent tool if they are operated correctly (This statement does not apply to anything or anyone involved with rap &quot;music&quot;; I didn't mean to get your hopes up).<br />So, if you can't enjoy this CD because it doesn't have distorted guitars and Eddie screaming his lungs out on every track... Go listen to rap &quot;music&quot;... you'll LOVE it (Very easy/little material to digest into your tiny little minds).
B00013EY7Q|1.0|After all the hoopla and misguided 'critics' fawning over this film, I went ahead and watched it, and came away feeling exactly as I felt years ago after watching 'Life is Beautiful' (albeit two very different films in tone)--I had just been subjected to a prime example of The Emperor's Clothes.<br />Instead of joining the lemmings who praise this utter yawner, call it what it is: BOOOOORRRRRIIINNNGG.  Dull, dull, dull, and not even close to what it's made out to be.<br />I'm a big fan of Bill Murray, but to call him Oscar worthy is nothing short of a travesty.  My only moment of levity (in between the yawns) was in the karaoke scene where Murray starts to sing--sounded just like his character Ned the Lounge Lizard from SNL days.  Very one dimensional.<br />Johannson at least shows she has talent, but considering the sleep-walk everyone else in this movie took, most anyone could stand out with even a minor amount of emotion.<br />Far and away the biggest disappointment I've seen in the past couple years, especially given the hoopla.  Was everyone else given a different video, and I only saw the out-takes?
0440237688|5.0|The Giver was unlike any book I have ever read before.  It captured my heart right from the beginning.  In a place where love, war, and flaws are unknown, a young boy begins to discover that his society is full of nothing but sameness.  They are lacking the beautiful things which make our society so special, such as color, sunshine, snow, and most importantly our incredible feelings of love.  Jonas learns that the world he has grown up in is meaningless, and he decides to turn his life around while he still can.
0875847706|1.0|Ugh.  How much of this Werner Erhard inspired sludge will we have to endure before the whole disgusting mess either dissipates or compacts down into an easily disposed of loaf?  Familiar to any cult-watcher, the buzz words spill freely here.  They are words and concepts that can mean anything to anybody.  Fuzzy, new-age pap which the authors unashamedly admit come from the culty, self-improvement seminar called Landmark Education which used to be Erhard's &quot;est.&quot;  <br />Sad to say, many Landmark devotees are encouraged by their participation to &quot;create&quot; endless testimonials reflective of their own egos, swelled to megalomaniacal proportions by various psychological tricks and techniques,  and the Landmark Corporation by proxy.  &quot;Spreading the word&quot; is part and parcel of the whole trip.  Keep a shovel handy.
B00005AREQ|5.0|Back when this release came out... it was such a ground breaker. It's hard now to even think of how innovative this was, because so much has happened over the passage of time.  Jeff Beck still has his chops together, which is certainly indicitive with the caliber of musician he is.  I have this in CD and play it every now and again.  I will have to say that this album influenced 3 or 4 follow up releases before Mr. Beck started changing his formula, riding the wave of earlier things that worked.  But this was cutting edge stuff back in the day...  and he still is releasing cutting edge stuff....  need I say more?
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Lost in Translation is definately one of this year's best films, but the Focus Features DVD release is far from perfect.<BR>The film is a delightful work with a script that touches the heart and the funnybone. Murray's performance is excellent and he manages to even outdue his work in Rushmore. Johansson's work is stunning and she manages to match Murray note for note throughout the picture. By being able to pair off with Murray in such an equal manner, the relationship that developes is so much more engrossing. After watching Lost in Translation, the thing that struck me the most was the uncanny mood that the film creates. This mood lingered with me long after I had left the theater. It doesn't take a trip to Japan to become lost in the translation of everyday life.<br />The worst problem with the DVD is the forced previews. This is the first disc I've ever owned where you couldn't just push the menu button to skip the previews. I don't even think skipping the track works. The previews actually were for decent films, but seeing this everytime you put in the disc is really annoying. <br />Video quality is good, but not great. Color and contrast were okay. Shimmering was not a problem. Unfortunately the picture seemed pretty soft. Although the cinematography tends to push an intended hazy look, there we some shots that seemed almost blurry that I don't recall looking this way in the theater. Beware there is a fullscreen version out there. There is no excuse for getting that because the film is shot in 1:85:1, so no matter how small your TV is your picture is going to be larger enough. I can understand, but don't condone the purchase of full screen editions for films shot in wider aspect ratios, because on a small TV the picture is barely visible. <br />Sound was quite good. There are many intriguing sound edits in the picture and the track was of good quality. Be sure to listend to the manipulation of the music when Murray carries Johansson back to her room.<br />Extras were a mixed bag. The interview with Murray and Coppola is very strange. It is shot in Rome on top of a building and the whole time Coppola barely speaks and Murrary's shadow covers her. Murray is straight forward and doesn't joke around. It is not very enlightening. The Behind the Scenes documentary is over long with lots of dull spots, but there are several enjoyable moments in it. For one thing Murray is hilirious and his off screen antics are a riot. The music video is boring, watching someone doing nothing but walk around Tokyo for an entire song gets tiresome, even if it's Scarlett! The deleted scenes are mostly extensions that add little, but be sure to check the robot scene. This scene is very weird, but totally fits with the mood of the film, too bad it didn't make the cut. There is also an extended clip of Murray on the &quot;Johnny Carson of Japan&quot; show. This is a riot, check out what Murray does with the &quot;surprise&quot; he finds in the box.<br />Lost in Translation is a great film, maybe not a classic, but time will tell. Coppola has proved herself as a skilled filmmaker and has removed the sting of her performance in Godfather III. Johansson has the potential of being a great movie star of the future as long as she continues to select quality projects like this. The Focus Features DVD has an okay transfer that is rather soft with average extras and a terrible set of unavoidable previews before the picture starts.
B0000041Z5|5.0|Johannes Brahms is, I believe, one of the greatest composers that ever lived, and is certainly high on my list of favorites. His symphonies are full of various feelings - happy, sad, or angry - that other composers simply avoid. I've come to the point where happy and merry music just won't do.<br />After listening to the collection, I've been amazed by firsts and lasts: the First and Fourth Symphonies; and each of their First and Fourth Movements. These pieces of music evoke some of the strongest feelings, which is why I consider these my favorites.<br />Overall, the rest of the Symphonies are pretty good as well, with two bonus tracks: the Academic Festival and Tragic Overtures. Anyone who admires Brahms MUST OWN this collection. It is a high-quality collection that has a very clear sound which is worth every dollar it costs. You will not regret it.
0671027387|4.0|This book was not as spectacular as Angels and Demons or the Da Vinci Code but is a much better novel than Digital Fortress. I thought the character Rachel Sexton was a great character, as was Tollard. I also liked how the secret government agencies in this book have a bit more power and have more power and authorite than they seemed to in Digital Fortress.<br />None of the suprises in this book are truly shocking and if you pay close attention or you are no stranger to this genre than you won't find any unexpected suprises but I did think everything wrapped up nicely and the author did a very good job as far as story goes.<br />I recommend this book and I extrememly recommend Da Vinci Code and Angels and Demons. 4 out of 5
B000002H97|3.0|Be prepared for a long review here...<br />Seeing people call the Black Album &quot;Metallica's last good album&quot; and then labeling the Load twins &quot;Sellouts&quot; never fails to leave me scratching my head. Let's actually define the word &quot;sell out&quot; here, shall we? &quot;Selling out&quot; is straying from your roots to appeal to the mainstream. This is exactly what Metallica did on this album. The same band that five years earlier said &quot;#G!@ MTV, we'll never do a video for them,&quot; did four videos for this album. Sure sounds like selling out to me. And unfortunately, unlike the later Load and ReLoad, the Black Album doesn't have a whole lot of solid music to offer (a point of contention, but I don't care).<br />Once album opener Enter Sandman hits, you know this will be much different from albums like Ride and Puppetz. Rather than the speedy riffs and complexity of earlier Material, Enter Sandman is a hook heavy, paint-by-numbers pop metal song. Rather than the dark, gloomy lyrics of previous albums; Enter Sandman's lyrics are playful, fun and humorous. That of course isn't to say the song is bad. It's admittedly one of the Black album's most enjoyable(despite the fact that it IS Metallica's &quot;sellout song&quot;) thanks in no small part to its excellent guitar riff. <br />This newfound happy-go-lucky tone carries on throughout many of the other songs on this album such as Wherever I May Roam and Don't Tread On Me. At least Wherever I May Roam has a great riff and cool mexican-style solo. But the lyrics, about the band being on tour, are totally stupid. Megadeth did a much better song about touring three years later with The Killing Road. Don't Tread on Me, on the other hand, is just plain bad. Boring riff, terrible lyrics, no real point. Should've been left off the album altogether.<br />Everybody's probably heard the two ballads (i.e. two more examples of the band &quot;selling out&quot;) The Unforgiven and Nothing Else Matters. I'm gonna say with a straight face that The Unforgiven is probably the most overrated song Metallica has ever written. Why the song became so popular seriously remains a mystery to me. There's a way to sincerely play with emotion, and there's a way to play with emotion just for the sake of playing with emotion. Metallica did the latter with this song. The verses and chorus just sound so contrived and forced. And the solo is probably the most grating Kirk Hammett has ever done. Nothing Else Matters is definitely an improvement. I actually like the elegant acoustic melodies here (although it once again baffles me that people waited until Mama Said to call Metallica &quot;sell outs,&quot; even though NEM is probably the most mellow/gentle song Metallica's ever written). Unfortunately, Hetfield's weak vocal delivery kills it. Ironically, the line &quot;Couldn't be much more from the heart&quot; is one of the many lines on The Black Album that sounds like it was sung without any real sincerity or passion. <br />As for the remaining songs, they meander between being pretty good (Sad But True, Of Wolf And Man, The God That Failed, Struggle Within - the closest the album really gets to a &quot;metal song&quot;), and really bad or mediocre filler (Holier Than Thou, Through The Never, My Friend Of Misery). So that adds up to roughly five or six good/decent songs out of twelve, hence the three star rating. By contrast, I grew to enjoy pretty much all the songs on Load and ReLoad save for may be Low Man's Lyric. And that's why, for the record, I have to recommend them over the Black Album. If you're looking to hear Metallica at their best; pick up Ride, Puppetz, Justice, or even the aforementioned Loads. Despite its commercial success, The Black Album is IMO Metallica's second weakest effort (their weakest being, of course, St. Anger).
B00006879E|5.0|Just love it.<BR>Amazing<BR>Can't get it out of my head )thank's, Kylie!)
B00004SZWD|3.0|This two disc set is Stevie Wonders' best. It qualifies as one of modern R&amp;B's finest recordings as well.
B00006J3WH|5.0|When I first saw the episode &quot;Once More With Feeling&quot;, I was in awe.  The episode is an incredible feat and the music is one the reasons it is so great.  If you are like me, when you see a musical, you like to be able to sing along with the songs in that musical.  This CD gives you all of the songs from the episode including the man singing about the mustard and the woman singing about the parking ticket she shouldn't have gotten.<br />One of the best tracks on the CD is the &quot;Hush&quot; suite from the &quot;Hush&quot; episode from season 4 which was nominated for an Emmy.  If you enjoy good music and are a Buffy fan, this is the CD for you.  I highly recommend it.
B000002U82|5.0|Don't Listen too my 'Discovery' or 'First and Last and Always' review - THIS is the best album ever. This is it folks. This is flawless. Anyone looking for the deifinitive album of our time, look no further than Pink Floyd's 'Dark Side of the Moon'. The album is legendary as one of the highest selling albums of our time. The music is so psychadelic, artistic and moody it is unbelieveable. It is either upbeat psychadel, or it is slow, broding, dismal music that can put you too sleep. Either way, this album is excellent. The members of Pink Floyd are genious'. This is absolutley legendary. From the moody, atmospheric sound effects and haunting chimes that set the mood, too odd synthesizer effects, to straight out vox-guitar-bass-drums attack, this album has it all. Even a clinging money rythmn. All instruments and effects are used too their fullest extent here, which makes for an excellent, truley flawless. All the songs are truley excellent, but the best songs would have to be 'The Great Gig in the Sky', 'Money', 'Us and Them' and 'Brain Damage'. But every single tune on this masterpiece are excellent. This is like a perfect painting, with alot of dark colers. The Floyd are true genious', and this album should be owned by everyone. Or should I say, this album own's everyone? Either way, this is without a dobut the best album of our time.
B00006SFLV|5.0|I can't rate the DVD yet because I'm just about to order it, but the show I give 5 stars.  I do have old VHS copies of it that I could painstakingly convert to disc, but why bother when I can purchase it?  Even despite the poor quality that some reviewers have spoken of.<br />I watched this series when it was brand new... I was 30 at the time.  Probably older than most viewers, but it touched something in me.  Obviously 10 years later, I am 40 now and can't wait to receive the DVD set in the mail.  This appeals to all ages... to anyone who wants to feel nostalgic about that special something that we sometimes lose when we get older and caught up in the day-to-day mechanics of &quot;life&quot;.
6303168507|5.0|It's been ten years since the release of Schindler's List. Some good films have arrived since then but I think there is no doubt there's hasn't been anything else better.<br />It's plain simple. And watch out what has taken XXI century. Has any other film moved you or made you think? Soundtrack, photography, art direction and sound are of the highest quality ever.<br />You will say Neeson and all actors don't make an excellent play. But is it a matter of actors? Who cares about films like Training Day or Leaving Las Vegas? And their actors won an Oscar...<br />&quot;Schindler's List&quot; is by far the best film of 90's. Only &quot;Gladiator&quot; is a bit closer than other mediocre films. Keep waiting for something good...
0312995423|1.0|I loved DaVinci Code but this was a piece of junk.  Most fifth-graders know more about computers than Mr. Brown does.  Implausable, and predictable.  <br />Save your money and your time.
B00000DHRZ|1.0|Now, I know that there are a lot of people who love The Offspring, and that's fine, but I just can't stand them. My sister lent me this album, and other than the first track, I hate it. All the songs sound the same, and this reeks of MTV-style Pop-Punk. I wouldn't like this album even if I were still in my MTV phase. Because all the songs sound the same, I can barely remember anything from this album, other than I hate it. The lyrics bore me, and are all about girls, or school, or some other over-used topic. The vocals are very whiny, and the riffs are dull at best. Plus, the fact that I hear this band all the time from the people around me doesn't help. <br />After listening to this album once, I decided to listen again with an open mind to see if I like it, and I hated it even more. I gave this back to my sister almost as soon as I got it.<br />Although, if there's something positive I have to say about this, it's that the first track (the opening one) is pretty funny. But, once track 2 starts, I hate it. So, I don't reccomend this album at all. If I ever need any Punk, I'll listen to the Dead Kennedys, or the Misfits, not this.
0441172717|5.0|whoever rates this book any less than 4 stars (in fact, I can't see how it could be less than 5) simply doesn't yet understand it.  I'd recommend rereading it at least once, as well as finishing out the series.  The scope of Herbert's plot is phenomenal and amazingly intricate.  I'll admit that I first struggled with the beginning portion of this book - but that was in 7th grade... after rereading it, I found it came together beautifully.<br />Herbert's story weaves politics and ecology with pure science fiction in an amazingly seamless way.  And, to answer the claim that LOR fans would do well to read this, I'd have to agree - but more importantly, I think Robert Jordan fans will see tons of amazing parallels between that series and this one.
B00008WG3U|5.0|Wow, another amazing album turned out by NOFX.  Classic lyrical genius from Fat Mike, new guitar riffs from Heffe and Melvin, along with a definite standpoint.  This cd is a must-have for any NOFX fan.
B00000IPAX|5.0|This is probably blink's best CD yet. The best songs are the three singles (\\"All the Small Things\\", \\"Adam's Song\\", and \\"What's mt age again?\\"), but \\"Dumpweed\\", Don't leave me\\", \\"Aliens exist\\"... and pretty much everything else is great. Oh and if you think blink suck, how do you know their drummers name? I have better things to do than learn the name of every drummer of bands I think suck.<br />P.s. Mark looks freaky on the back.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|I desperately wanted to see this movie after seeing the glowing reviews.  Frankly, I was disappointed.  By now everyone knows it's a story of Bill Murray, the aging star in Japan to make a lucrative commercial, and Scarlett Johansson as a young, unfulfilled wife.<br />Much has been made of Murray's performance, but frankly, I don't see the excitement.  He's basically playing Bill Murray and his enjoyable dry wit but there is absolutely no new ground broken here and no stretch required to play the role.  If anything, he underacted.<br />Scarlett Johansson is another matter.  For such a young star she is able to convey her inner self with the slightest blank look.  I predict a long and very successful career.<br />I left the theater feeling very unfulfilled.  Could the press and nepotism in Hollywood account for the hype of this film?  Was it the intellectual's desire to tell us what we would enjoy?  Or is this another Coppola masterpiece? All I knew is when I left, I was bored and depressed.  But over the next two days, I continually revisited the haunted Scarlett Johansson character.  Does she divorce?  Does she ever get happy?  Does she see Murray again?  DOES SHE FINALLY GET OUT OF JAPAN?  And that's what makes the film worth the trip.  when an actor/screenwriter/director can make you think.<br />Entertaining movie?  Not really.  Thought provoking?  Yes!
0385504209|5.0|I never thought I would fall into the trap, yet I was entrigued by the books premise.  You all have heard it by now, so I don't need to repeat it.  What I need to say is that this book is beyond the scope of anything I have read previously.  EVER.  Yeah, it's true to say that I don't agree with what mr. brown is alluding to and what kind of a revelation he uncovers, but what I will say is that I respect him beyond almost any other author I've previously read because of his reviting plot and entriguing characters.  I just could simply not put the book down.  I picked it up on a friday night and had it finished during the early hours of sunday.  At least for me, that's quite a gripping book.  If you are a fan of anything fiction, please please check this out.<br />One thing that makes this book stand out is all the research that mr. brown had to do.  I had such a great time uncovering the secrets of The Mona Lisa, Virgin on the Rocks, the origins of the pentacle, the olympics, venus and its orbit, the number &quot;e&quot;, and most especially the Priory of Sion.  The wealth of knowledge you absorb from the novel is enough alone.  Then of course there is the page turning quality of the novel and all of the hours of sleep you will lose.  Things that he mentions in the earlier parts of the story surprise you.  Then, geniously, he brings them back again with an even greater meaning that makes you beg the question, &quot;how did he do that?&quot;  So you've heard my two cents, now read the novel yourself so you can formulate your own.  Whether you agree with his viewpoint or believe it's a load of garbage, you'll still find yourself on the ride of your life.
B0000AQVCL|4.0|With all the pop crap that is out on the radio today, along comes Jet with a real Rock &amp; Roll record.  The Amazon review seems to think that the lyrics on this album are &quot;banal&quot; and &quot;a problem&quot;.  No one ever said that lyrics on AC/DC albums (&quot;Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap&quot;) or every album by the Stones (&quot;Under Pressure of the Night!&quot;) were poetry.  Rock and Roll is about a feeling, a mood, a look, a sounds...and all these elements combined.  <br />Jet make you want to get up and dance...and drink...and party.  The songs, for the most part, are simple chord progressions with catchy hooks.  The band looks the part and actually writes the music while playing the obligatory guitar, bass and drums and creating driving rock that begs to be cranked.<br />If you're looking for deep lyrics, look elsewhere...if you are looking for an updated rock &amp; roll record reminiscent of the Stones and the Who with a lot of spunk that will get you partying, get thee to your nearest record store and pick this up!
0679457607|5.0|Just to respond to the reviewer who was querying about the long-term reliability of the Inner Game approach. I can only speak for the tennis side (not being a golfer and not having read this book, so my five stars refer to the whole Inner Game method itself) but as a rule of thumb, because the techniques he teaches are simple in nature, they are easy to replicate and, I have found, the more that you use them the more effective they become.<br />I will say that if (IF) his approach works as well for golf as it does for tennis, then it should definitely have a lasting  effect on your game. (NB: In the Inner Game of Tennis, he does not actually deny the importance of technical knowledge and says that you should acquire the basics as well. I would say that his books are better for people who have grasped the fundamentals of a sport than total beginners).
B0001AP12G|5.0|Kanye West! A great producer and lyricist. I bought the cd yesterday and fell in love with it. Most of the songs are inspirational and full of humor. One song that hit me the most is JESUS WALKS! I played that song over and over again and sometimes wish why didn't I wrote it!? Anyway, Kanye is one of the greatest producers/rappers in hip hop im my eyes. Luv ya, Kanye!!!!!!!!!!!

0060931671|3.0|I haven't felt like this after reading a book in a long time. This is not to say that I dislike difficult books. I typically enjoy a challenging read. It was suggested that I would like this book because I have given books by DeLillo, Ellis, and Danielewski high ratings.<br />What makes this different? Most importantly, I think, is that I felt no great attachment to any of the characters, especially not Oedipa Maas. Therefore, the intrigue is not nearly as compelling as it could be. Who cares about the conspiracy, W.A.S.T.E., Tristero, or Thurn and Taxis? Especially given the final outcome.<br />I do, however, give it three stars because it has some moments of brilliance. The revenge play is fantastic, the word play is often amusing, and it does have a hallucinatory feel.<br />Obviously, some people will like this more than I did. I fully accept that. If you're up for a challenge, enjoy language, and don't put a high premium on characterization or plot, then this is worth the read.
B00005QCVY|5.0|This is the best Christmas movie I have ever seen.  My family and I watch it every holiday season.  It has everything--humor, romance, and drama.<br />Jimmy Stewart is George Bailey, the man who gets to see what would have happened had he never been born, with some help from his guardian angel (Henry Travers).  Donna Reed is his loving wife, Mary.  Lionel Barrymore is Mr. Potter, the sly miser who tries to take advantage of the whole town.<br />Once you watch this, you'll feel better about yourself and the whole world in general.  I highly reccommend it!
B00008BXJF|5.0|I'm a casual Crimson fan - I remember Court of the Crimson King (21st Century Schizoid Man,) Discipline (Elephant Talk,), etc. - have followed Fripp a bit, Adrian Belew a bit... but I must say, this album is extraordinary. It takes time to digest and develop an appreciation for it (listen five times, put it away for a month, then come back to it), but once you've absorbed it, it is an amazing achievement. And I have a different take on &quot;Happy with What you Have to Be Happy With&quot; - I think they're poking fun at the whole songwriting endeavor, of which they are members of that same &quot;community&quot; - it's self-deprecating humor, in my book. But what an album! It's plays like a Symphony. Of the three hundred or so albums I've bought, this is in the top five. And I like it better than Discipline - it's more &quot;complete&quot;.
B00004RF97|4.0|It seemed for a while like I was fated never to watch this DVD.  I received it as a Christmas present and having heard from another classic movie buff that I just HAD to see it, I was quite eager.  But one thing after another came up and I only just got to watch it last Sunday.<br />Well, I have to say this is one of my favorite movies of all time.  Although I have never been a fan of Katharine Hepburn, I really liked her in this.  She played the part of Tracy Lord, a wealthy young woman who is about to marry for the second time.  However, her ex-husband C.K. Dexter Haven (Cary Grant) has other ideas.  He sends in two reports from Spy Magazine (Jimmy Stewart and Ruth Hussey) to do a story on the wedding.  Tracy's precocious young sister Dinah (Virginia Weidler) stands by, avid for scandal.  (&quot;Mother, maybe he's going to sock her again!&quot;)<br />This is a good, clean movie.  This makes it possible for the whole family to watch it, although young children will probably not see the point and be bored.  The only reason I left one star off was because there are virtually no special features on the DVD.<br />Once you see &quot;The Philadelphia Story&quot; I bet it will be on your list of favorite movies, too!
B00005Q4CS|4.0|This film didn't really teach me anything I didn't already know about drugs.This movie won't really teach you anything.In fact, most of it it surreal, and a lot of it is a series of dellusions coming from the characters screwed up heads. The power of this movie lies not in the clear cut facts it presents about drugs.This movie is not learning about drugs, it is practically experiencing what it is to belong to a substance, and be in complete possession of something that isn't even alive, albeit inside the character's heads. With this movie, such great pain is shown, such suffering, such dellusion and insanity, you will never want to take drugs in your life<br />Enough with the drugs.I think this movie is so much more than just an anti-drug movie.It's about what happens when people live in their dreams, instead of facing reality.It's what happens when people escape into their own dellusion; until their worst nightmares catch up, and ultimately, wipe out any dreams which may have kept the charcters' hearts beating. It shows the slow  and gut wrenching crumble of humanity, the wiping out of human decency; until all thats left is a pile of dust. Drugs, addiction, are what cause this deterioration of the human spirit, in this heartbreaking, harrowing, unforgettable film.<br />Lets talk about the acting. Lets talk about Ellen Burstyn, who gives an absolutely phenomenal, fearless, heartbreaking performance. Her succumbing to the inevitable downward spiral of addiction is one of, if not the most heartbreaking thing I've ever viewed on film. Her performance was so real, that at times, I kept having to remind myself that this was just a movie, and that in real life she was fine. And sometimes, that was real hard to do. Jennifer Connelly is so under rated, and deserves a lot of kudos for her acting. She's a beautiful actress with real chops. Anyone who appreciates cinema cannot deny that she is a true dramatic gem. She is greatly emotive,and truly intriguing, while all the while keeping a subtle,natural approach.She does not overact anything. and that is such a rarity in young actresses and actors these days. Marlon Wayans also deserves some props.He played off his supporting role without stumbling once, proving himself a real actor, and not a funny stunt man from scary movie and the likes. Jared Leto however, is one of the main reasons I took off one star. I really don't care if he lost 1/5 of his weight. He is a weak actor who works much better in films that do not demand such great emotional potency. He does not deliver what the rest of the actors bring to the movie. The scene where he (attempted) to cry was laughable.He oevrworked himself in some parts, and his Brooklyn accent was overdone.That said, what saves him is the great emotionality the other actors bring to the film. Burstyn and Connely in particular. Ellen Burstyn is the emotional core of the movie, and was absolutely cheated out of her oscar.<br />Much has been made of the films cinematography and use of visual effect. I don't know, I guess I'm kind of on the line about it. NO sense in arguing, it was very well done, but sometimes it just got too over the top.I agree with the notion that the hectic visual effect throughout the majority of the film were sort of like a metaphor for the chaos drug use brings on, but there were some cases in which it was not neccesary and seemed like the director was just showing off.ALl in all though, the film's visual aspect really helped create the mood of the overall film, and had it been toned down a little bit I would not have had a problem with it. The score was just brilliant and provided such a heartbeat for the film.The music builds such potency and will stay with you as a part of the movie.<br />The final 15 or minutes of the movie provide one of the most heartbreaking, but most memorable endings you will ever see. In the final scenes of the movie, theres no more dazzling visual effects, no more noise, or chaos.Everything is completely stripped, and all that is left is pain without promise.The ending will leave you breathless and emotionally drained. I wish the world could see this movie and feel what I felt.This movie however, is not for people who are easily disturbed, and if you do not like depressing films, do NOT watch this film.IT is truly horrifying, even for people who don't mind having all hell drained out of them. Requiem for a Dream may not be perfect, but it really is the most emotionally powerful film I've ever seen.If you deny its emotional potency, you're lying to yourself.

B00018D44U|5.0|What a personal statement this record is. Satisfying and inspired, like her excellent debut CD, but there's a difference. The country flavor is more pronounced on this one, but in a good way. Norah's country doesn't strike me as the country of Faith Hill or the Dixie Chicks. Rather, it's the country overtones of Pat Metheny and Keith Jarrett, country filtered through the prism of a gospel sensibility and a jazz education. It's jazz country. The intersection of down home and uptown is what gives these artists their universal appeal, and what makes them uniquely American. It's making Norah Jones America's Sweetheart.<br />Norah's jazz is lovely. &quot;The Prettiest Thing&quot; is just that. It has an interesting chord progression, reminiscent of Jarrett's 1970s tunes, with an unexpected Cmaj7-to-B modulation that introduces the element of surprise in the tune. The rhythm of its turned-around intro reminded me of Paul Simon's &quot;Celia&quot; with what sounds like an odd meter that may just be dropped beats that won't be missed but is only a straight four. The effect is hypnotic, especially the vamp out with the two girls quietly echoing the lap steel over that Cmaj7-to-B, unresolved.<br />All the tunes have catchy, if sometimes languorous, rhythms. The &quot;jazziest&quot; of them may remind you of private high school jams you felt lucky to attend. Take, for example, &quot;In the Morning.&quot; Norah sings and plays over two guitars, which provide a pleasant, syncopated drone. Norah stretches out on the mighty Wurlitzer electric piano. (Like mine, the tan one with the little built-in speaker.) Her funky exposition resonates with her bluesy vocal intonations, bent notes being easier to insinuate on electric. The effect of a 1970s R&amp;B jam is uncanny. It put me behind the mic again, reaching for the Donny Hathaway.<br />The most striking element of Norah's jazz, though, is her own accompaniment to her voice. Her piano breathes with her. The placement of notes, gracefully filling the empty spaces, is never intrusive. Maybe you get such sympathetic accompaniment only with pianist/singers. I think of Dave Frishberg, whose playing is his most effective backup. Or Nat Cole, whose singing swung hardest when he was at the keyboard. Like them, Norah is her own best accompanist, which is to take nothing away from her excellent band, but Norah's piano has a dynamic range that ideally supports her emotive content. Repeated listenings are due the Duke Ellington tune &quot;Melancholia,&quot; renamed &quot;Don't Miss You At All&quot; by Norah, who penned the lyric. We are rewarded with insight into the composition itself, resurrected after these many years, with a haunting, repeated augmented dominant 7th motif. Insight into the importance of touch, her piano whispering, crooning, commenting, recalling Bill Evans, who, like Norah, was unafraid of silence. Norah's piano is always appropriate, the perfect complement to her words.<br />Her words are poetry. The depth of feeling in this twenty-something will startle you. There's a story there. Whatever it is, it's an American story. Norah Jones offers us some of the best of what America has to offer at this moment in our history. The product of a cross-cultural, some would say interracial, liaison, her heritage is a perfect reflection of our patchwork demographic. Born in New York City and blessed with a Texas childhood, she is like us, streetwise with a head alive with cowboy songs. She must have loyal friends. She must be with a good man. Her mother must be a wonderful person. Surely, she herself is a contented person. It's in her voice, in her words. I guess they're her words. It doesn't say who wrote what, but Norah delivers the words as if they were her own. Like a great singer. Like Billie Holiday, she strips a song of its chaff to reveal its kernel, displayed like a shiny stone. She doesn't need a big arrangement. She delivers a lyric unwrapped.<br />But the arrangements on this record are sublime. Like the songs themselves, the arrangements are deceptively simple. Deceptive because the songs don't sound arranged, they sound improvised. Of course, there is some improvisation, but the improvisation is not the thing. The lyric is the thing, and the arrangement, the accompaniment, is always in service to the lyric. When the &quot;gamblers are chancin' their all,&quot; the faint accordion brings to mind that place on the bayou with the sawdust floor, and you smell the shrimp, hear the click of the dice. And when she's pulled off the road with the baby, you just know it's some blue highway with no shoulder and she's stopped on the high grass, at her wit's end. The mournful pump organ echoes her despair and helplessness, but it also gives us hope for everyone's redemption. You fall in love with her, the baby, and the baby's daddy.<br />This record feels like home. Not some super-sized McMansion with an empty handball-court living room and a ten-foot gravel verge separating it from its replica next door. No, it's the home we always wanted, the one we remember from the childhood we wish we'd had, with dusty door handles and nail-popped pine floors, wavy from generations of women's work. A farmhouse full of people from Wendell Berry's books. It's a country home, but fixed up, like the house in &quot;A Cool, Dry Place,&quot; the one where the girl next door lives. Norah Jones, America's Sweetheart.
B00008PW2E|5.0|Release this DVD!!!! What is taking so long?! I can't figure it out! My husband and I are going MAD!!!!!!!!!
0446530573|5.0|The recipes in this cookbook are absolutely delicious.  You will not be sorry if you buy this book.  It makes a wonderful gift also!
0441172717|5.0|Really good book :)  It is very easy to read, and the flow is really good!
B0000CFW87|5.0|I think this album is fabulous!  My four children all love it and play it over and over, and my husband and I have continued to really enjoy it.  I only wish I could find the english translations somewhere.  This album is a good buy, and appeals to all ages.  <BR>I think those critical reviewers must not hear all of the trash kids are listening to these days, and I appreciate anyone who produces something kids love that can wet their appetite for quality music.
0385504209|3.0|First of all, the book is okay, not great, as some people assert(read some good books!). It seems to me that being suspenseful doesn't make a book great, or even really that good. The information presented is pretty interesting stuff, and I also had trouble putting it down, but the characters were pretty simple and generic (Teabing? Stereotypical eccentric old Brit? Can you say John Clees? Don't get me wrong, I like John Clees). Also, the story was pretty cheesy in places, not to mention very choppy, with big chunks of symbological information crammed into some awkward places. With the amount of information he presented(and interesting), it could have been incorporated into a better story. That said, the book is causing a stir, and it is encouraging people to question things that they may not have questioned before. Also, it seems that the only danger in including &quot;questionable facts&quot; in a fictional story is that, unfortunately, people might totally believe them. I'm just wondering...is that the reader's problem or the author's? And as a sidenote: Someone said that the orbit of Venus doesn't form an exact pentacle. If you connect the dots it does, but if you don't, then it just forms a rosette-like shape, with five points. Pretty close if you ask me.
B000089RVX|5.0|I first heard this CD when my 12 year old was playing it.  I just about died, their music great and the way they mix the hard music with such a voice is heavenly.  I am rocker from the late 70's and 80's this album is hot and I HIGHLY recommend you get this, I know I bought a copy for me.
B000056N8X|5.0|Some regard this film as &quot;Highlander...the Apology&quot;. If this is the case, then apology accepted. I wasn't sure what to expect with this film, given my reluctance to take Duncan MacLeod or anyone associated with the TV series seriously. I was pleasantly surprised to find this film very well done. The acting, soundtrack, special effects and storyline were all superb. <br />Even if you refuse to watch any other sequels, give this one a chance. It does an excellent job of passing the torch from Connor to Duncan. After this film, I can even stand watching the show from time to time.<br />Bottom Line: An excellent film with more character development and emotion than any other Highlander film. Any fans of human history, particularly those who enjoyed the first film, will love this sequel.
0060930187|4.0|My family read this book together so we could discuss it, and after having read it, our feelings were mixed.<br />Mom found this book utterly boring.  She said she could not empathize with the main character, and didn't care what happened to her.<br />Dad enjoyed the imagery, and said he would like to read some of her poetry.  He also enjoyed her observations, which were at times witty and clever.  But he felt the book was lacking.<br />Then there's me.  I really enjoyed The Bell Jar, finding it to be a real page-turner, even if not the greatest book I have ever read.  After reading the biography in the back of the book, I have to think that Esther Greenwood and Sylvia Plath are one and the same.  <br />One interesting point of The Bell Jar is that it can be interpreted in many ways, but one doesn't have to TRY to interpret it in order to understand and enjoy the story.  That is, it can be read on many levels.<br />The content of this book is at times shocking, so I would steer the very faint of heart and children away.  It's a good, easy read, and it paints a picture similar to Girl, Interrupted or One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.  If you like a good, psychological study, you might want to read The Bell Jar.  I also suggest The Bell Jar to a book discussion group, as there is plenty to talk about as the story moves along.
0783240287|5.0|I got this for my dad for Father's Day because he was wearing his vhs version thin.  My dad loves the DVD and it has grown on the rest of us.  Donny Osmond is spectacular, and Maria Friedman is great as a narrator (she puts a lot of comedy into it).  I was able to actually find the CD music soundtrack for this DVD at the Really Useful Group in the UK.  Amazon doesn't carry it, but they maybe they will if enough people ask for it.  My dad's only complaint of the DVD is that the sound settings are hard to configure.  We weren't able to figure out if it was the recording on the DVD or our machines (the background singing was totally faded out).  I'm not sure what the discussion on the provocative clothing - if your child does jazz/tap, they'll understand that it's just a costume.
B00018D44U|5.0|I just got the new Norah Jones album, \\"Feels Like Home\\" and I have to say I really like it.  I wasn't always a huge fan of hers at first but I heard the album was really good and worth the buy.  I agree; I enjoyed it a lot.  It's very relaxing and definitely a good CD to just throw on at work or while driving home and unwinding.  My favorite track off the album is \\"Those Sweet Words.\\"  I liked the way the vocals and piano were in synch.....it reminded me a lot of \\"Don't Know Why,\\" which I always liked hearing on the radio.  A friend also lent me their copy of 2 other CDs that Norah was on (I had never even known they existed).  I listened and LOVED those tracks as well.  If anyone is interested, the other CDs are \\"New York City\\" and \\"Chance and Circumstance\\" (they are actually listed on Amazon if you search for &quot;Norah&quot;).  My 2 favorites from those other CDs are \\"New York City\\" and \\"Heart of Mine.\\" The jazz and blues style they had is amazing and I think I'm going to order a copy of them for my own CD collection as well.  Feels Like Home is amazing!!!
B0001AP12G|5.0|I like this cd, althought a few songs are missing that i heard from the advance, this still is one of the best cd's i have heard in a while. The Roc is doing Big things wit ppl like Kanye, Cam'ron, and the Young Gunz....Kanye should keep up the good work and keep the hits coming...
B00005R23S|5.0|I owned the VHS of this show, gave it away to a friend so I could get the DVD, well I can honestly say im dissapointed in the sound, it seems on the VHS version you can hear the whole band plus Bruces voice but this version they seemed to quiet the band and the audience and made Bruces voice stand out, kinda lame if you ask me. I want to hear crowd noise too. Now I dont have a stereo TV but still I can tell the mix has been changed. well maybe when I get a TV with surround sound it will sound better, video is great.... as it should be with DVD. I was at MSG for 2 of these shows, (not these though) and I can without hesitation say that Bruce Springsteen is the best live act on the planet. Highly Recommended.......
B000002VMH|4.0|I doubt that anyone, by the time Eurythmics were ready to dissolve, ever doubted that Annie Lennox was one of the great vocalists to emerge from the 80's. Just what they may not have realized was just how soulful she was. Her first solo album, &quot;Diva,&quot; arrived with the kind of jaw dropping fanfare that even those who were waiting on the fence had to admit it; Annie had the chops that lived up to the CD's title. From the first emotional wail of the single &quot;Why&quot; to the humorous send up of bar-flapper pop, &quot;Stay Young and Beautiful,&quot; this was Annie stepping away from the stylistic remnants of the Eurythmics' box and into a whole new world of music, even for her.<br />Not to disparage her work with Dave Stewart, much of which still sounds great today, but their work as a duo was often confined to what his vision of a Eurythmics record was supposed to sound like. The open, airy sounds of &quot;Why&quot; or &quot;The Gift&quot; (co-written with the Blue Nile) probably would not have fit stylistically on a Eurythmics disc, and gave Annie a chance to express herself in a manner different from, say, &quot;Sweet Dreams.&quot; While at the same time, she was obviously mindful of how many of her fans would be expecting something in that vein. The pulsing pop of &quot;Walking On Broken Glass&quot; fills that space. (It also gave &quot;Diva&quot; a substantial hit.)<br />Annie also didn't shy away from some experimentation. There's the middle eastern flair of &quot;Primitive&quot; and the icy wave of &quot;Cold&quot; to show that, while some Divas feel a need to belt their way out of a situation, Annie understood that wrapping yourself in cool mystery has a more lasting effect. It's what makes this &quot;Diva&quot; the kind that has held on to its original grace and gives it staying power.
0451167716|4.0|Noone hasn't heard of The Godfather. Almost everyone has seen it. The movies (I and II) have been acclaimed as some of the greatest films of all time. The Godfather in novel form more than lives up to the expectations that in most adaptations the book is better than the movie. The story follows the rise of Michael Corleone as the Don of his mafia family. Michael is an unlikely Don who starts off as a college-graduate and war-hero who is ashamed of his family's illegal ties. But then circumstances changed...<br />The book has one better on what the movie has been accused of - gratuitous length. Godfather I and II are both very long and the attention to detail detracts from the attention spans of the more impatient viewers. But a novel is expected to be long and detailed - in fact it's not too long by literary standards.<br />The book covers Godfather I and parts from II which talk about Vito Corleone's beginnings as an Italian immigrant. It also has many plotlines that aren't in the movies. The greatness of the book is that it creates a whole world of emotion - with the loyalty, betrayals and murders. The book ties in subtle parts of the plot together making you see things that watching the movie aren't at all obvious (like the intentions of certain characters and the motivations for their behaviour). If you liked the Godfather movies at all or are interested in the workings of an Italian crime family at it's grandest, this book is gold.

Ya know how shes got, like, straightened hair, scary black make-up covered eyes, hot topic ties and coverse shes worn about once. total punk. which she shows on let go. lets start with the first song losing grip. &quot;didnt you feel me lock my arms around you-whyd you turn away?&quot; feeling a little insecure avril? if she is so punk then why does she sing a song about cuddling. part of the reason might be that she doesnt even write her own songs. she get songwriting proffessionals the matrix to help her with her &quot;rock&quot; songs. isnt it weird that the matrix write songs for hillary duff too? like there is a coincidence.<BR>most of the songs on this album are country pop. want some examples? lets try the song that got avril famous-complicated, as well as anything but ordinary (ooooh she wants to stick out from the crowd-now theres something we havnt heard before, my world, things ill never say (she proposes marraige-what a ROCKER), and naked. unwanted is an anthem of a spoiled teenager not getting her way . nobodys fool is half rap(HAH)half folk, and im with you-ugh dont even get me started. &quot;i'm with you la la la&quot; doesnt exactly want to make people start head banging, and it sure doesnt label you a punk. tomorrow could be taken out of a norah jones album. mobile is a heart wrenching(NOT) song about packing up and leaving.oh-sk8er boi-well that never gets old.&quot;he was a boy, she was a girl-can i make it any more obvious&quot; ill bet you 10 dollars if she tried really hard she could make it even more shallow. this song is NOT hardcore, it is pure, annoying pop-which is fine if you like that kind of thing coming from a poser princess.<BR>if you check out avrils official website you might see a few pictures of her rocking out on a couple different electric guitars. has anyone ever seen her play guitar? does she ever play guitar? can she play guitar? this doesnt matter on the album caus shes got her boyfriend to play guitar while her voice goes through who knows how many computers to make it sound like it does when you listen to the album (which i have had to live through)<br />DO NOT GET THIS ALBUM EVEN IF YOU LIKE THE MUSIC!

B0000AOV85|1.0|When I got a DVD player my wife and I agreed that since we don't watch movies repeatedly, we would only purchase DVDs that we could enjoy without sitting in front of the screen. Like DVDs of concerts or music videos.  She bought me this one because I told her how much I liked the &quot;Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and wished I had a copy.  Man is this a disappointment.<br />This is not &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;, it is a documentary styled sleeping aid about the album, if you can imaging that.  It is a collection of talking heads telling way too much about their internal realities with a couple of bars of the songs thrown in.  I doubt anyone other than the speakers and a few music historians care two beans about what they have to say.  If you want to hear the music, buy the CD, because there isn't any music on this DVD that's worth hearing.  This DVD should have a warning label that it is not intended for recreational use.
1401300901|1.0|You can certainly tell the author is young.  There was no substance to this book.  If I were 21 or so I might have enjoyed it more, but it read like a harlequin romance novel and I am truly embarrased to have chosen this book for all the other women in my book club to read.
B000068PQ7|5.0|&quot;White Light&quot; stands as a snapshot of Gene Clark at his song writing peak. The songs are all heartfelt, full of interesting melodies and delivered with his sweet, soulful vocals. I've noticed a couple of reviews that have knocked the production and mix. Both are very much of their time. You have to keep in mind the album was recorded and released in 1971 and reflect the era it was recorded in.<br />From the opening bars of &quot;The Virgin&quot; to the powerful &quot;1975&quot;, &quot;White Light&quot; (aka &quot;Gene Clark&quot;) is one of Clark's finest solo albums. Jess Ed Davis' guitar solos perfectly compliment Gene's low-key songs. The instrumentation is perfect for the material Gene wrote.<br />The remastered sound is terrific and a huge step up especially when you compare it to tracks recorded after this and released much later on &quot;Roadmaster&quot;. The instrumental tracks have better depth and separation and compare very favorably to the material recorded by Clark's contemporaries (including his old band The Byrds). Differences in the sound can be attributed to both the acoustics of the studio and the desired effect that Clark and producer Davis wanted to achieve.<br />The bonus tracks are outtakes recorded during the album. They aren't cast off tracks either. While the instrunmental backing tracks aren't quite as full or perfect as those for the tracks from the album, these are complete recordings. Clark had a lot more time to record because of the stripped down approach and late nights he and Davis put in recording the album. As a result, Clark had much more material recorded than was needed (a similar situation to the album &quot;No Other&quot; although on that reissue/import the bonus tracks are alternate takes with only 1 previously unreleased re-recording of &quot;Train Leaves Here This Morning&quot;).<br />Definitely the album to become acquinted with Clark's solo albums with and worth having for fans of The Byrds as well.
B00006879E|5.0|This album is amazing. I can barely find other words. The music has your rock, some r&amp;b, and a little funk in there too. I believe they are one of the most original groups around right now, and their second album pleased me so much. It's kind of like Stevie Wonder, but with the right mix of rock and roll
B00005JMJ4|1.0|This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  I kept expecting something to happen in the movie and it never did.  There are a couple funny spots but they are few and far between.  A most of the movie consists of shots of Japan with no dialog.  Keep your money and see or buy something else!

B00011RPB0|2.0|I don't understand how someone can say a movie is good just because it's artistic.  Take the movie for what it is.  The movie to me was boring and uneventful.  It was kind of racist after I thought about it.  Japanese surfers...she seemed like she was trying to make a spoof of this.  She was basically commenting on the whole japanese culture in this movie, thats all it really was.  The characters where there just for her comments on japanese culture.  <br />The love between the two characters was the reason I watched it.  The development of their love seemed plastic and pushed.  Yes, they were two strangers needing a partner in a time when they were alone.  Everyone understands this.  The problem lies in the development of their love.  The Karaoke scenes were good but the rest of the interaction and dialogue was pretty much passe.  If this was supposed to be artistic and fresh, then show some new ideas about love.  <br />I read somewhere how Coppola was &quot;true&quot; to her characters.  The characters didn't have much development opportunities so there was nothing to be true too.  They were kind of boring actually.  Bill Murray was funny, but the girl was vanilla plain.<br />There are plenty of movies where a middle age man meets a young woman and sparks develop.  Where does this movie seperate itself from those movies...it doesn't.  That is the problem.  When it comes down to it this movie is just bad, artistic or not.
B00009V7P8|5.0|Damien's album O is one of my favorite albums now.  I have had it for a while (ordered as an import) and it has held up over repeated listenings.<br />He is also an incredible live performer (I have seen him 6 times).  His singing partner Lisa Hanigan is just as good.<br />I highly recommend this for fans of singer songwriters as well as fans of good low key music.  BUY THIS ALBUM NOW!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I picked up this box set on a recent trip back home to Canada and was so blown away with the characters and the unraveling tale that I watched all 14 episodes in about 72 hours!  Ok, jet lag was a factor.  Even so, Joss Whedon has put together a fresh approach to Sci-Fi and has assembled resonant characters along with some very VERY talented people to play them.  Above everything else though is a simple fact:  Joss gives good story!
B00004THAY|4.0|I can understand not liking this album, if you had some rational reason for not liking it, but to come out and say that Eric Clapton can't play guitar is just ignorant. And then to follow that up with some wacko conspiracy theory...well, that just makes me think that phila should start taking his medications again.<br />Here's a little background for that concert where phila said that Clapton couldn't play and SRV blew him off the stage. As told by Clapton himself, this was the first time he had ever seen SRV play live. During the first set he came backstage to watch the first three songs SRV played, then went back to his dressing room. The second set, he did the same thing. A stagehand asked him why he wasn't staying for the whole set and Clapton said, &quot;Because if I did I would have started to doubt my ability to play the guitar&quot;. Obviously, Clpon was very affected by how brilliant SRV was, and it's not too hard to imagine that it might have affected his playing. So, it wouldn't be a huge surprise if Clapton wasn't at his best that night. But to judge his whole career by that one performance...well, like I said, that's ignorant.<br />This is a very very good album that allows us to hear two masters of the blues guitar playing together. Listen to the samples and if you have any taste at all, you will be able to tell that Clapton can most defintely play, and both he and BB are wonderful on this album.
0385504209|5.0|Let me state that I rarely read \\"best sellers\\"...in fact I avoid that whole Best Seller wall like the plague. In fact I only picked up this book because of several weird instances of synchronicity (which I won't bore you with hehe).<br />I had trouble putting the book down once I started reading it. I found the story quite compelling, the characters multi-faceted and interesting, and refreshingly devoid of gratuitous sex and violence. Yes there are some murders going on. But the Terminator movies were much more graphically violent. In my mind the murders only served to advance the plot.<br />As for the historical accuracy, well I'm no Biblical scholar. However there is indeed QUITE a bit of corroborating evidence (confirmed by actual historians), for much of the stuff cited in the book. And the more that is coming out about early Gnosticism, the more it looks like the early Church was indeed engaging in a cover up.<br />But those issues are really irrelevant if you are looking for a good NOVEL, which is what this is. It's not a theology textbook people. If you are some ultra-conservative wanker, stay away from the book completely, as your fragile little world is unlikely to handle having your religion questioned. Everyone else though, with even slightly open and curious minds, is likely to find the book a fascinating and good read.
B00011RPB0|2.0|Probably the most overrated film of the year.  A good word for this movie is DULL, because it goes nowhere fast.  Bill Murray is a has-been actor from the states filming a commercial in Japan.  While there and bored he meets Scarlett Johansson, who is also bored.  They get together and are bored together.  Its contagious and quickly spread to the audience.  Not sure what the buzz is about.  Murray's talent is clearly wasted here.<br />Rent or buy something else.
0345452577|3.0|I agree with some of the other reviewers who believed that Mr. Kellerman's traditional lead character, Alex Delaware, was getting a bit stale.  So, now Mr. Kellerman has given us Jeremy Carrier, but a psychologist is not a big leap in character differentiation.  More imporantly, Dr. Carrier is not much of a character.  Not much personality, not much flavor.  I can't remember the last time I was less interested in a book's central character. If you can get past the lack of a good central character, some of the supporting cast members, such as Arthur Chess, are somewhat interesting, but none are compelling.<br />The story itself, a whodunit, with Dr. Carrier trying to determine the identify of his girlfriend's killer is decent.  There's not a lot of action, so the story is mainly cerebral.  It's not a bad way to spend a few hours, but some of Mr. Kellerman's early books are a better diversion.
B0000C6E4D|5.0|I knew right away when I heard \\"Fallen\\" that &quot;Afterglow&quot; would be a vast improvement over &quot;Surfacing&quot;. Don't get me wrong; I don't think &quot;Surfacing&quot; was bad, per se. It was still 100% better than almost anything anyone else has ever put out, but it just wasn't up to par for Sarah (in MY opinion).<br />That being said, WOW! This is a beautiful CD, I am so happy to report.<br />&quot;Stupid&quot; uses amazing crescendo and decrescendo that gives me chills. The orchestration is incredible. I can't wait to hear this song live, I'm pretty sure I'll be misting up.<br />&quot;Trainwreck&quot; reminds me of old Sarah...real old, good, Sarah. It's got a great driving drumbeat. It's not exactly a dance song, but I defy you to sit still while listening.<br />You can tell these songs had a lot of thought put into them both lyrically and melodically. Each one with it's own special traits. No &quot;written in 5 minutes&quot; here. If there is, it's disguised beautifully and further proves her genius. The orchestration and production is luxuriant and full and Sarah's voice sounds better than ever. &quot;Fumbling... fans rejoice!<br />(read full review at collectedsounds.com)
B00000K0DQ|1.0|This movie makes a mockery of the crimes it based its<BR>screen play upon. Gee, we never did see a young woman <BR>grabbed from the street as she was walking home, now did we?<BR>The easily guided, less than intelligent youth, given the sentence of the electric chair? It didn't happen. But what does reality have to do with it? As all Christians, I pray that <BR>Ms. Prejean will remember that pride is the sin of angels,<BR>as do we all.
B000002G87|5.0|How incredibly beautiful, and how incredibly sad. To laugh and cry in a single sound.
B000002MQ9|3.0|Best advice on this cd is do a sound check first! I LOVE DCD and would highly recommend their music but this is NOT my favorite! So why do people check reviews anyway? . . .it's just someone's opinion . . .I read these wonderful reviews and found that this cd is my least favorite DCD . . . .I love Lisa Gerrard for her incredible talent but that is not reflected on this album. I love her haunting middle eastern flavors, the driving rhythms and her wonderful Celtic influences. . . suffice to say this album does not offer that. . . . I found it slow, morose, and boring. . . . . again sound check and make your own opinion . . .
B0000VAFO0|2.0|How is it possible that a movie about vampires versus werewolves with a woman as hot as Kate Beckinsale in the mix can be dull?  Somehow they managed to dull down the excitement that the trailer promised.  If they had sexxed up the scenes between Scott Speedman and Beckinsale they might have saved this movie, but all the special effects and shooting wasn't enough.<br />Hard to believe this movie was as dull as it was.  Rent or buy something else.
B00003CXA6|5.0|I'm also glad I viewed it in the recently released DVD format, with commentary, behind the scenes narrated by Martin Sheen, maps etc. which help pull the movie itself together. Seeing Gods &amp; Generals on DVD led me to Gettysburg, made 11 years earlier. I expected shoddy production values &amp; a cheaply done movie when compared to G&amp;G. Not so. I watched a old Robert Duvall playing Gen. Robert E. Lee morph into a younger Martin Sheen . The difference was neligible, but the most amusing moments in a decidedly not amusing movie were General Sheen gathering himself to attention to salute which he did a dozen times or so during the battle.<BR>   The Battle of Gettyburg was fought over a period of three days in numerous locations in the area. This movie covered three important engagements culminating in what is know as &quot;Pickett's Charge&quot;. After day one the Confederacy was at it's high water mark. By the end of day three they had suffered reverses &amp; losses of men they could not replace. This signaled the beginning of the end for the rebels although the war continued for almost two more years. The outcome was inevitable when it became obvious that Union would not stop &amp; would not negotiate. Thus the war after Gettysburg was one of attrition. <BR>   I considered myself well educated on Gettysburg &amp; the Civil War in general. That I learned so much from this movie pleased me &amp; I say well done.
B00005QK5X|5.0|Like others reviewers have said, the Wipers truly are incredible!  These three albums are definitive without a doubt so if you're reading this and are not sure about what to do just fork over the 20 bucks and have at it on this box set.  Like another reviewer mentioned it's not like a Rhino or Legacy thing where you get all this hoopla and name dropping.  This is the Wipers and forget the bullsh*t \\"scene.\\"  You pay 20 bucks for three albums and get incredible music with basic liner notes that don't glorify the \\"good ol' days\\" which I'm sure were not all that good and/or easy at all.  If you don't like them the first time around, listen to them again and by the third or fourth time around you will be blown away unless you think The Exploited or some goofy Sex Pistols rip off band is your idea of \\"punk.\\"  These guys should have had as much or more press in the day as their contemporaries such as Black Flag and the like.  If I had to name a band that had zero pretense it would have to be the Wipers on these first three albums.  It is just so unfortunate that bands like this are not much more recognized.  I think what impresses me more than anything is how the Wipers were one of the few bands lumped in with the whole hardcore/punk early 80s thing that actually marched to their own drum and actually could produce a powerful sounding album without being a bunch of tough guys about it.  In the early eighties not many bands had the balls to try to put a picture of themselves with their dog on the back of an album cover!
B00018D44U|5.0|When I heard Norah Jones' secpnd album Feels Like Home, I became a big fan of hers.  I didn't like her first album too much, I thought it was too mellow and jazzy.  Her second album is fanstatic it has little bit of everything, pop,jazz, and country. Fanstastic job on your second  album Norah Jones!
B000002UJQ|3.0|Is it too obvious to mention Douglas Adams's Hitchikers Guide To The Galaxy book and tv series and its influence on this album? Probably to older British fans. Its just that one of the main characters of this comedy book/radio/tv series was a super intelligent moaning depressed robot called Marvin the Paranoid Android.And theres the album name.The most common phrase mentioned in the book is ok computer.And that Lucky song dont half sound like a Pink Floyd cover version of the theme tune to the BBCs early 80s tv version of the book.And er yeah this album is ok from what ive heard of it.
B0000DZTIW|4.0|This recording marks yet another brilliant score by the artistically prolific Hans Zimmer. Samurai boasts a haunting and beautiful main theme for the emotional turmoil of the hero, Nathan Algren played with genious by Tom Cruise. Zimmer does not need to fill every cue with bombastic abandon,like other composers who write action scores. He creatively weaves emotionally powerful cues such as &quot;Safe Passage&quot; with the nessesarry action cues on which Zimmer always shines, such as &quot;Spectres In The Fog&quot; &amp; &quot;Way Of The Sword&quot;. Start to finish, Zimmer's score for &quot;Last Samurai&quot; is just another reminder why he is in the upper echelon of todays few great film composers. Bravo, Hans.
B000059XUI|4.0|In most ways I think this is the best of the Superman films.  Gene Hackman was fine as Lex Luthor in the first film, but here he really gets to step out.  His breaking out of prison and repartee with the villains and Superman are just great.  (Think about his remark about using a door when the villains smash through the doors and walls of the Daily Planet.)<br />The villains are all suitably cartoon evil with Terence Stamp as the Evil Leader General Zod, Sarah Douglass is the alluring Ursa, and Jack O'Halloran as the comic, strong, and silent Non.<br />Christopher Reeve continues his embodiment of the Man of Steel - even when the plot twists because of his love for Lois Lane.  The first scene at that diner is actually touching and the final scene there is a crowd pleaser.  Margot Kidder does her best work here as someone moonstruck for Superman but also unstoppable as a reporter digging for facts even when it will not be in her interest after she finds them.<br />And the delightful Valerie Perrine does a great comic turn as Eve Teschmacher.  I always enjoy her work in movies, on TV, in drama or in comic roles (as here).  She should get more work - she has a lot to offer as a mature actress.<br />Good family fare and interesting to return to 20+ years later to remember who was in this movie and see the good performances that are actually here making this cartoon fare more than you expected.
6305428352|4.0|This movie set up a pin and knocked it down.  It follows a rather predictable path, and the script relies too heavily on coincidences (such as the music-teacher having a deaf son) rather than character depth to make its point.  However, it was genuinely entertaining and not too far over the top to watch again.<BR>The back of the DVD case provides an ample summary of the plot:<BR>&quot;(Mr. Holland) accepts a 'day job' as a high school music teacher... In time, however, Mr. Holland realizes that his real passion is teaching...&quot;<BR>Coming myself from Oregon, where the film was set (and filmed), I was able to feel a great deal of empathy for the budget cut issues raised in the latter part of the film.  The resulting cut of the art and music programs in the state actually occurred there, during the time when I was a student.  It has been mentioned that, perhaps, the ending was not as bright as it could have been.  However, it successfully portrayed a real problem in the modern American school system.  There's no doubt about the message this is trying to send.  Subtlety isn't a part of the film's charm.<BR>I actually felt that most of the scenes have relevance.  The scene of the funeral for the boy killed in Vietnam was a stock moment, but at least it was mercifully brief and tasteful, rather than pouring on hokey dialogue.  It allowed Mr. Holland to make a tired point to a stoner in his class, and prove his excellent and influential teaching methods by the end of the film.<BR>The encounter Mr. Holland had with a young singer in his school play who fell in love with him did actually add to the story.  She makes the point that he could come with her to New York and pursue the dreams he always had (and gave up when he had a child, bought a house, etc).  From the expression on Dreyfuss' face, the viewer can see that she has had an impact- that he perhaps hadn't even noticed until then that he had been simply marking time in his life, expecting it to be different &quot;some day&quot;.  In the very song Mr. Holland sings for his son, there is the line &quot;life is what happens while you're busy making other plans&quot;, and the scene with the singer is when he realizes that for himself.  In short, it's the character's catharsis scene- when he decides that he's actually pleased with what he has done, and what he is doing.<BR>All this has been done before.  There's really nothing original to be found in the script or the characters.  &quot;Mr. Holland's Opus&quot; is simply a fairly well-done telling of a common tale.  What makes it tolerable and, even, enjoyable, is that it mostly manages to steer clear of silly or unrealistic dialogue, even in its more overly melodramatic scenes.
020530902X|5.0|I can't help being a little self-conscious as I write this; I dread breaking any of the rules that are tightly packed in this 105-page book. However, I feel it's necessary to heap more praise on this wonderfully slim tome, even though decades of praise have been lavished on it already. There's a reason why ELEMENTS OF STYLE has been around so long: it contains plenty of precious gems of advice to guide the high school student, while delivering plenty of reminders for the seasoned writer. During my academic career, as a student and instructor, I've had dozens of writing handbooks come across my desks. Since 1976, this is the one book to which I've turned for help, again and again.

B000002VJH|5.0|I was shocked to find any reviews here for this album that were less than 5 stars.  Here is an album that has such life/head changing potential that any petty argument of \\"live vs. studio\\" of GD is for posers. It makes sense to me  that this album came out in 1975 marking, in my opinion, the peak of the band's quality and the peak of the best decade for music. It has often been argued that this was the point when rock and roll's true heavy-ness started to go downhill (spawning the era of punk)  This album is so spiritual that one could have nothing but pure reverence for it while increasing the desire to collect as many live versions of \\"Help On The Way\\"  as possible.  The version of Crazy Fingers has organ and congo drum sounds that you could never get from any live recording and as for the title track.. shouldn't every album (including Black Sabbath as they demonstrated) have a song that, if relaxed enough, might put you to sleep?.. \\"Without love in the dream it'll never come true.\\"

B000059Z8J|4.0|This movie is now more than 25 years old and while the special effects have aged and the pacing of the movie seems a tad slow by modern standards, there is a nice spirit to the movie that still carries through.  My 10 and 12 year olds enjoyed watching it with us and enjoyed the story.<br />The performances are all pretty good.  Margot Kidder never looked better and Christopher Reeve really became and embodied Superman.  He had all the right qualities.  One of the interesting things is noticing all the actors you had forgotten were in this movie and remembering where else you have seen them or heading over to IMDB and looking them up.<br />Good family film and nostalgia trip.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I am not a huge fans of &quot;art house&quot; movies or, for that matter, of Sophia Coppola.  However, &quot;Lost in Translation&quot; is a wonderful movie.  You've probably heard it before, but it's true:  this is Bill Murray's best work.  You've probably also heard that the movie is &quot;deliberately paced&quot;.  Those of us with less tact use the word &quot;slow.&quot;  This is also true; however, it is slow in a good way.  We might focus for a long time on Bill Murray squirming uncomfortably in a strip club without hearing a line of dialogue, but this speaks of his character, a middle-aged white American out of place in a foreign land.  The laughs are well earned and are due almost entirely to Bill Murray's talent as an actor.  The movie changes from being serious to funny and back without ever becoming pretentious.  If forced to put this movie into a category, I would call it a romantic comedy (the term gives me shivers), but the friendship between Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson is pure.  Coppola never betrays her characters.  They do not undergo any life-altering changes, but enjoy one beautiful week together before parting.  With so many independent films following the standard pacing and plot lines of Hollywood releases, this movie is a very welcome change.
B0000025IE|3.0|i have just got into metal thanx to a friend, so i have been lookin up bands and i came along this one, when i first heard it, i thought it was awesome, BUT i started listening to other metal and relized..these guys aren't THAT good. The better metal is iron maiden, metallica, ac/dc, slayer, anthrax, panthera i could go on! it is worth the money don't get me wrong, but just look at some other ones to, because there are many better bands out there
B0001AP12G|4.0|This album has great songs and beats songs like never &quot;All falls down&quot;, &quot;Spaceship&quot;, and &quot;Never Let me down&quot; are amazing not to mention &quot;Through the Wire&quot;. The problem with this disc are the skits. It feals that after every single song there is a skit, and most of them but maybe 1 or 2 are stupid. This album is still good and i suggest you buy. It's not as solid as 50cent debut but it still has great songs. I just wish that those skits were not on it, and wish that Kanye could of been with another label because Rocafella sucks. Kanye West has got to join Aftermath. Westside!!!
B000025XKM|5.0|Although someone with a (admittedly large) cultist appeal, Nick Drake's music has never failed to enthral or inspire those that are willing to embrace his work. After suffering from two breathtaking beautiful, but commercially underperforming albums (\\"Five Leaves Left\\" / \\"Bryter Layter\\"), Nick retreated into himself and produced his darkest album yet. Alone with nothing except an acoustic guitar (and a piano accompaniment on several tracks) Nick sings his way through some of the most reflective, poignant & introspective work of his short career. And the brevity of each of the songs (most clocking in under 3 minutes) only exemplifies it's anguish & disenchantment, with Nick quietly strumming his guitar, and leaving his plaintive voice to exude emotion. For me this stark world that Nick inhabits is (for me) best exemplified by what I Consider a song of anguish, yet remains a truly, truly beautiful song.  \\"Parasite\\" encompasses everything that was significant about Nick Drake and proved to be what was to be his fitting swan song (the retail poor performance of his previous albums caused Nick to fall into a psychically crippling bout of depression). And thus `Pink Moon' was the final album release that Nick completed before his death, and remains one of the most emotionally stark albums ever created.
6304005490|4.0|Lover Come Back (1961). In Color. Running Time: One Hour, 47 mins. Directed by Delbert Mann. Written by Stanley Shapiro and Paul Henning.  Once again the teamwork of Doris Day, Rock Hudson and Tony Randall are cast together again after the success in the comedy film, [[ASIN:B001TKUXVQ Pillow Talk]] (1959).  This time it's Rock that needs the tomato juice after being out all night, still in his tuxedo, he was driven right to work.  Rock has an agency's account to nab, so of course a little nightclub dinner and party is in order. Meanwhile, Doris Day is trying to get the same agency's account with true professionalism.  When she finds out she is to late for the account because of Rock's presentation of a &#34;Roman orgy&#34;, she is appalled.  Here is where Tony Randall comes in.  He gives Rock a talking to about his methods and to apologize to Doris.  Phone bantering goes on between the two.  Rock doesn't apologize but insults her purity.  The war is on.  Rock invents a fictional product called &#34;Vip&#34; and uses Edie Adams as a &#34;Vip&#34; girl for fake commercials. When Doris finds out about &#34;Vip&#34; through Edie's &#34;good medal of conduct&#34; at the executive meeting, she tries to get that account too, with the help of Ann B. Davis (Bob Cummings Show, The Brady Bunch).  Isn't that a beautiful top Doris Day is wearing just before the shocker?  Nice fur coat Rock Hudson is wearing.    Cast also includes: Jack Oakie, Jack Kruschen, Joe Flynn, Jack Albertson (Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory, Chico and the Man) , Donna Douglas (The Beverly Hillbillies), Ted Bessel (That Girl) as an Elevator Boy, William &#34;Billy&#34; Benedict.    Doris Day, Rock Hudson and Tony Randall re-teamed once again in [[ASIN:B00007GZR0 Send Me No Flowers]] (1964).

B000002UJQ|2.0|but radiohead is simply not as good as they should be. And before you all go off half-cocked, telling me that I &quot;don't understand&quot; or &quot;don't see the hidden genius,&quot; let me explain something to you: There is a fine line between hidden genius and a Brittish man crying into a microphone. Radiohead is, unfortunatley, the latter. And believe me, I tried to like them. I bought this album, painstakingly listened to each song, and it just didn't do it for me. I am giving this album two stars, however, because &quot;No Surprises&quot; Is a wonderful song, and I'd hate to condemn it along with the rest of the garbage on this album.

Roland tells his ka-tet of times of old, when Gilead still stood and a war was just being waged by a John Farson. <br />As a teen, just after passing his test to become a gunslinger, his father sends Roland and his two closest friends, Cuthbert and Alain away to the town of Mejis. This is for Roland's safety, for we learn that his father's magician and advisor, is out to kill Roland. It's a very complicated entanglement and it seems best all around that Roland leave Gilead for awhile, until tensions calm.<br />While undercover in Mejis (the boys had to assume names and a cover story for their protection) Roland meets Susan, the love of his life. Unfortunately, Susan is promised to be a gilly (mistress) of the mayor. All bought and paid for with dishonest money. Susan only agrees to this deal so that she can regain her late father's land for her family. Mostly, she is goaded into it by her aunt Cord, a greedy spinster.<br />Roland and his friends maintain their cover of &quot;counting&quot; supplies for the barony, however while doing so, they uncover evidence that the men in power in Mejis has taken sides with Farson, &quot;The Good Man.&quot; Mejis has been used as a storage area for Farson's horses and weapons, tanks from another time or world. Little do the boys know that the real secret weapon isone of the &quot;wizard's glass&quot;, an orb that allows one to see events of the past, present, and future.<br />It's too late for them to alert Gilead and send for help so they must take action themselves. There isn't much time, Farson's men will be coming soon to collect their supplies. Roland vows to protect Susan, who is now carrying his child. The two of them plan for a fairy-tale ending.<br />Things don't always happen the way we hope.
B000092ZYX|5.0|It's a bit difficult to bring myself to write a review for anything Radiohead for two reasons.  First: the fear that no one will read it-- this is one in almost 900 reviews and why should my opinion be any more valid, accurate, or informative than the next guy's?  Second: my love and fanaticism for Radiohead has made it so I can barely look at anything they do objectively-- I love the sound of their beats, computer blips, Johnny Greenwood's guitar, Thome's vox that perhaps &quot;Hail to the Theif&quot; isn't what I think it is.  Maybe it isn't a modern rock masterpiece.  Maybe it's just average music played by a far-above-average band.  Well, if this is an average CD (as so many are claiming), then Radiohead have done what is possibly the best job in history of covering it up, because it is the ONLY (the ABSOLUTE only) album that I heard in 2003 that literally made my jaw drop.<br />I can remember exactly where I was and what I was doing during said jaw dropping; driving home at midnite.  I had been given an advanced copy of &quot;Thief&quot; by a friend and half way through &quot;2+2=5&quot;- during the repeated insistence that we have not been &quot;Paying attention,&quot;- it happened.  My upper and lower teeth seperated, my heart stutter-stepped, I felt my stomach moving for my throat.  It was a legitimate jaw-drop.  No album this year (or perhaps ever) has made that happen on the first listen.<br />I suppose that's why I love Radiohead.  Not because of their &quot;no rock star&quot; attitude, not because of their critical praise, not because of their redefining sound, not because of their changing the music business by simply being in it, nor because of their half praising/half complaining fanbase.  It's because they make really really really great music.  A radiohead book I have quote's Thome as saying &quot;I will always use pop music to express myself.&quot;  Pop music for sure, but it's distorted in such a way that makes you look at art and (yes) the worlddifferently.  Plain and simple.<br />So that's it.  I'm not even going to go into depth about the album other than to say it's another Radiohead masterwork.  That's four now.  Quite an accomplishment for the length of time given.  &quot;Hail to the Thief&quot; is absolutely essential.  Overall:  10 out of 10.
B000002H6C|5.0|Yes, Master of Puppets is great, but I disagree with many...it's not their best. &quot;And Justice For All...&quot; is their greatest work. Forget the complaints about no bass (I hear it, maybe I'm tone deaf), Justice is harder and meaner. Master of Puppets is a very good cd and the title track is perhaps their best track ever--it's a hard and very good sounding track, in fact I've never heard a live version that's better than the studio version. Justice is f*ing angry.
0385510438|5.0|In this book, John Grisham returns to his southern small town roots such as in &quot;A Time to Kill&quot;. This book shows what life is truly like in many small towns in the rural South. I could see many characters that I grew up with incorporated into this story. I think it is one of his best ones lately. John Grisham is an excellent auther and can hold his own with any mystery writer anywhere!
0684833395|5.0|While I was reading this book, I couldn't help but crack up.  In class people would look at me oddly and then I would have to explain what was going on and then they would be laughing too.  The way Heller presents these incredibly eccentric people is ingenius.  His third person narrator is very matter of fact, though more compassionate toward some than others.  <BR>   The story starts out with Yossarian in the hospital flirting with the nurses and screwing around with his pal Dunbar until an annoyingly patriotic (but extremely likable) Texan moves in and pushes them all back out into war.  The actual plot takes awhile to get going, but there is not a single boring page in this book.  It is one of the funniest things I have ever read, and one of the most profound.  It attacks bureaucracy, questions and ponders religion, and deals with ever present death.  Honestly one of the best books I have ever read, and I recommend it to anyone who wants a good laugh but wants to think too.
B000089RV6|5.0|There have been many records over the ages that critics have scoffed and listeners have loved.  And there have been albums that critics have hailed as &quot;one of the greatest blah blah blah&quot; that we have all scoffed at.  And every once in a blue moon there is a very special brand of record that everyone (yes EVERYONE) loves.  AC/DC's &quot;Back in Black&quot; is one of those albums.<br />Many classics are here (&quot;Hells Bells,&quot; title track) but few seem to notice all of AC/DC's influences coming into their own as well.  It's not just metal.  It's the blues, R&amp;B stuff that pushes the album and nearly makes &quot;Back and Black&quot; what it is.  The call-and-response of &quot;Givin the Dog a Bone,&quot; the deep, repetitive riffs of &quot;Shoot to Thrill,&quot; the story-on-the-porch of &quot;Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution&quot; and the anabashed R&amp;B swagger of &quot;Let Me Put My Love Into You&quot; and &quot;You Shook Me All Night Long&quot; is what made this album a no holds barred classic.  On top of everything else, this is the most fun any blues-metal album will ever be.  Overall:  9 out of 10.
B000002TPS|5.0|This is a great cd. I've always liked &quot;so far, so good...so what?&quot;, even though the production values are always criticized--but I have to say that this one is a favorite. Yes, &quot;Peace Sells&quot; is probably the best work in most fans minds, but this is a close second or even first. &quot;Risk&quot; sucks and I'm about to write a review of that, so don't think that I like everything Megadeth puts out!
B00018HU4U|5.0|People should just stop comparing this to Norah's first CD and listen to it for what it is. \\"Come away with me\\" was a great album. \\"Feels like home\\" is also a fantastic album. They are not the same; and why would anyone want them to be? The point is...this is worth every penny and you will not be disappointed. Just listen to it for what is is..a fresh new CD with a blend of great new jazzy songs. I have been playing it non-stop and am enjoying every minute of it!
B00005JM1F|4.0|I can honestly say I left the theater unhappy after watching this movie.  And I don't know exactly why, but I think it's because this was somewhat of a formulaic comedy similar to just about every other comedy out there.  <br />But the more I look back on the theater, I think I went into it looking for a &quot;classic&quot; comedy, something new and mind blowing, and this isn't that. This is along the lines of Billy Madison, Happy Gilmore, and even as far down the food chain as say Duece Bigalow or The Ladies Man.  (yes, I have targeted SNL Flicks there, but this movie DOES star Will Ferrell).  That being said, I think of this movie as having some great lines and or scenes (Shawnn William Scott's small part is one of my favorite parts of the entire movie).<br />If you're looking for some goodhearted, crude, humor, then this is the flick, it's not a &quot;classic&quot; (it's not Animal House, as much as it wants to be), but it's well worth a watch or two.  If even for just the funniest 10 moments or so.
B00006ZCFH|5.0|I have been a fan of Erykah Badu 's since she first came out and all I've got to say is two words to all of you who call themselves disappointed with her latest work...YOUR CRAZY. This cd is bad. What more are you looking for her sound is always fresh and I especially like the way she reintroduced us to some of our old favorites through various new mixes. Erykah is the music she makes which is no different than a few other REAL artist out there. Real atrist are creators...so you may not get it right away if your the type expecting to get what you already had before...who wants leftovers? BORING.. We never crucified Prince for being himself. Stop trying to box the sista in to corner.  I liked the cd the minute I played the first cut and it made want to check the whole thing out. So hat's off to Ms. Badu and other artist like her who try to keep it fresh and stimulating for us folk who love seeing artist expand our musical minds. For the rest of you stick to the cookie cutter stuff you hear played on the radio 300 times a day..all fluff and no fill.
B000002H2H|5.0|Yes, it's five stars, but by no means the best Metallica CD. It was a huge step forward for the group after Kill 'em All, with a very crisp and hard edge.
B000003C2S|4.0|This seems to be Death's forgotten album, and I suppose if you're gonna forget any of their albums, this one should be it. It's certainly a good metal album, but not really great, and easily my least favorite Death album. Nevertheless, if you're serious about metal you'll probably enjoy this album.<br />Overall, the riffwriting on this album is very good, and the songwriting is solid, if not spectacular.  The solos are greatly improved, with Murphy being multitudes better than the more or less incompetent Rozz, and Schuldiner's already excellent lead work improving. Normally these elements would combine to create  at least an 8 or 9 of 10, but this album has got a few flaws that pull it down.  Simply put, the production on this album kinda sucks.  I hate complaining about production because people love to make a huge deal over it all the time, but it really is the single most notable flaw here.(Though those those who whine about it tend to be complaining about modern albums which sound multitudes better than ANYTHING recorded before the mid-90's, so it ain't quite the same thing.)  It's very, very clear, especially considering the era that it was recorded, but in order to gain this clarity they sacrificed a lot of intensity.  The mix is spacious rather than thick, and the vocals are way to loud. Furthermore, Schuldiner's vox are by far the weakest of his career.(imo of course.) They don't sound nearly as good when they float over the mix rather than cut through them, and they use some weird effects which make him sound kinda warbly a lot of the time.(Conversely there are some real cool vocals effects which pop up a few times, like on Defensive Personalities when he lets out that real wicked shriek.)  Overall, his vox are decent, but they aren't nearly up to Death's standards.  Perhaps most importantly, the drum sound on this album is totally weak. They're too quiet(a rarity in death metal) and the snares and bass drums just kinda click weakly.  This is probably a more natural sound than they had on Leprosy, but it severely undercuts the power of the album.(The drum sound is very, very important in making Leprosy as heavy as it is) Lastly, the guitar sound is pretty sweet, as it always is with Death, but they just aren't loud enough in the mix.  The production here would be good for a thrash album, but it can't quite cut it with death metal.(I don't wanna sound like I'm ragging on this album too much, cause I really like it. It's just one of the few albums were the flaws are very, very apparent, so I might as well point them out.)<br />In spite of that, this is still a very, very solid album.  There are no throwaway tracks, although it generally isn't as memorable as the material on other Death albums, with or without the unfortunate production.  Though they don't have as many memorable choruses, the riffs are probably a step up from Leprosy.  They got quite a bit more variety, and lots of them are more overtly thrashy, which I like.  The title track is easily my favorite song here.  It's got some lovely, slower bludgeoning riffs which help overcame the production and a totally sweet prechorus. Plus it's nice and epic, which I always like.  I also particularly like Defensive Personalities and the raging closer Killing Spree.  Nothing else stands out all that much I suppose, but none of it really needs to be skipped. A very consistent album, even if it is rarely truly spectacular.<br />Anyways, you probably ought to buy this album.  It isn't utterly mandatory, but all the other Death albums probably are, so you might as well complete the set.re natural sound than they had on Leprosy, but it severely undercuts the power of the album.(The drum sound is very, very important in making Leprosy as heavy as it is) Lastly, the guitar sound is pretty sweet, as it always is with Death, but they just aren't loud enough in the mix.

B000002WPI|5.0|First of all, production quality is not what makes this album such a classic.  Please let me note that.  It sounds a bit like it was recorded in a tin can, but as I said, that is not why this is a classic.<br />The \\"odd\\" beats, strings and uses of samples not ever attempted in hip hop before are part of what makes this album great, but the lyrics are fantastic as well.  All 9 members of the Clan (Rza, Gza, Ol Dirty Bastard, Masta Killa, Inspectah Deck, U-God Ghostface Killa, Raekwon and the Method Man) sound HUNGRY on this album.  They tell grimy street tales with a mix of slang and intelligence that has been hard to compare to since.  <br />This is still the best album from the Wu Tang, even if the production is not as slick or refined as the new projects are.  To some extent, I think it almost made this album better. Rza's beat work on this solidified him as one of the big names in the Rap game and it wasn't long after this album that the Wu spawned 10's of Solo albums for almost all 9 of the original members, as well as helped push the careers of Cappadonna, Shyheim, Streetlife, Remedy and Killah Priest among others.  <br />This is where it all started, and this is still the best album from the Wu Camp, so if you're thinking about buying one of their other albums but don't have this one, maybe you should point yourself in this direction, you won't be dissappointed.
B00005JMX4|5.0|For anyone thinking that this movie is another American Pie or Risky Business, keep on thinking.  I went in thinking the same thing and was blown away.  The premise is somewhat unbelievable at first but you forget that and concentrate so much on the characters.  Every time I tried to predict what would happen I would be surprised.  The movie is always one step ahead of what you think will happen.  The acting is superb, the story is brilliant, the movie is one of the best Coming of Age Films of the past 5 years if not the past ten. Unlike American Pie no character is a characature. Don't waste your money by seeing something else.
B000002UUX|5.0|A lot of people call this the best Megadeth CD. After revisiting it after about 10 years, I do agree that it's very good. In the top three. Probably in this order: Peace Sells, Youthanasia, Rust, So Far... I don't like the hokey Hangar 18 theme of aliens (isn't this kinda weird?) and was a bit embarrassed when the video came on VH1 the other day--had to turn it when the really bad muppet-type creatures came on. But it's otherwise a very good CD.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|I just wanted to quickly say that this is a beautiful movie, one in which its strength lies in the visual and emotional aspects.  Definitely on of the best movies I have ever seen, and I can't understand why some people don't like it.  My best guess is that you just need to be an artistic/creative person to appreciate it and basically be in a kind of pensive mood while watching this movie.  I am moved every time I watch it.  We have to get the average up from 3.5 stars.  This is an Oscar contender, people!!  It must be good (and it is - very).
B00018D44U|5.0|When my husband and first listened to this album last weekend we liked it but not as well as Norah's first album (which we love). After listening to the album a number of times over a few days we now belive we like this album at least as well if not better than the first . Well done Norah !! We buy very few albums where we love every cut on the CD but this is one.
B00001QEBQ|5.0|Wow! This is my most favorite movie of all time. I know it<BR>has dull graphics, but the story is beautiful. The story is different from other Disney movies.<BR>It is about a Chinese teenager, Mulan Fa, who doesn't give honor to her family. Her father was going to fight for China, but Mulan doesn't want that. Instead of watching her father die, she does something about it. She sits on the stone dragon watches her father through the window. Once the lights turn out, she runs away from home.<br />She cutted her hair and putted it in a bun. She learns that beauty isn't the key to honor. That it is to be the most kindess.
B000002H6C|5.0|Yes, it's great, but I disagree with many...it's not their best. &quot;And Justice For All...&quot; is their greatest work.

B00018D44U|3.0|I was very excited when I heard Ms. Jones was coming out with another cd.  Yet ,I am a bit disappointed in this one.  The songs all sound the same which sound the same as the first.  It would have been nice to have a little more variety and for her to try a little differnt things. <br />I still enjoy the cd, but it is not my favorite.  I hope her next one will offer something different!
B00005V9IK|5.0|Independence Day is the best alien movie i've ever seen.  Not because of all the action and explosions, it's just a great sci-fi epic.  It starts as the government spots strange sitings in the atmosphere, and everything takes off from there.  <br />Jeff Goldblum, Will Smith, and Bill Pullman give it there best in this monumental achievement.  Everytime i watch it, i just feel so pumped up when it's over.  I'm sure everyone else does, except for those no good ass-clowns who think it's a bad movie.
6301066642|5.0|I think this is one of the best musicals available. And- if you're into musicals this one you need to get. Since Hollywood refuses to make musicals you better latch on to this one while you can. I think the color and the musical numbers are wonderful! And in those days they used better color for films than they do today! For color films  and for  tv viewing they use cheap color. Many people has told me that they thought their tv was fading out and had a foggy color to it. I've told them it's not their tv at all. The best color was always used back in the 40's and 50's.  I see nothing ethnically wrong in the film that would be wrong. People are just too too sensitive these days and now they are picking the old films apart. They need to learn  how to get over it. I am so glad that they have not destroyed these old films because 98 per cent of the films today are trash and will never become classics such as this one. When all the great producers and directors and screenwriters pass away there just seems like no one can take their place. They knew what they were doing back then. The craftsmanship has been lost.
B00012L786|4.0|Samuel Fuller's background as a journalist shines through in Pickup on South Street as his story begins by bringing the audience directly to the point where a man pickpockets a woman's wallet out of her purse.  Unknowingly the pickpocket, Skip McCoy (Richard Widmark), gets his hands on a microfilm containing government secrets as an undercover agent witness's the theft.  Candy, the woman whose wallet was stolen, is swayed by her ex-boyfriend to try to retrieve the microfilm from the thief  by using her connections in the underworld.  At the same time the undercover agent attempts to find the pickpocket through the city's police force, and they use the local informant to discover the identity of the thief.  Both Candy and the law use the same female informant, who supplies them with valuable information that leads them to Skip.  Fuller's direction brings Skip's destiny onto the silver screen with suspense as his direction is forcefully straight forward without ambiguous intentions.  It has been said, that what you see is what you get, and Fuller certainly knows how to put a scene together so the audience gets what he wants them to get.  This leaves the audience with a noteworthy cinematic experience.
B000005JA8|1.0|Oh no you don't.  Not on my watch.  This sort of thing might have been funny in the past, but we have standards.  You don't expect me to just stand idly by while something like this goes unpunished, do you?  Well, then you're sorely mistaken.
1400034779|4.0|Really fun, light read. Will definitely pick up the sequels. Nice twist on your average mystery with endearing characters. Enjoyed reading about the country and its people, as well.
B00018D44U|5.0|When Norah Jones hit paydirt with her 2002 debut Come Away With Me, the album turned her from a struggling jazz singer into a pop crossover sensation. That last album went to #1, won many Grammies and proved that you didn't have to be scantily clad to sell records, unlike Skankney Fears. Turdran Turdran's Fan is WRONG AGAIN as usual! Music is not all about beats or dance songs, it's about talent and Norah has that and much more. Songs that are good are Sunrise, the cover of the old Tom Waits tune The Long Way Home and the duet with country legend Dolly Parton Creepin In. Plus it features Levon Helm and Garth Hudson from The Band. The Beatles are the most important group ever! By the way, Norah's new disc debuted at #1 with over a million sold. Will the new Janet Jackson match it?, I don't think so Duran Fan or shall I say Cranky ol' boy. Ignore that joker and his biased reviews and buy the new Norah Jones disc.
B00003CXCT|5.0|It's about time I got word from a star wars insider at lucas arts , that the trilogy will be released in a 4 dvd boxed set on September 21 2004. This is the movie series that started the new age of special effects and sci-fi movies. The trilogy is a part of history in the movie biz and I highly recommend it to all. So if you want a piece of movie history get it, sit back and enjoy the ride of your life.
B000068QVN|3.0|Good CD but why repeat most of the tracks from Live Album???  Where is Time Machine??????
B00018D44U|4.0|Ok. At first I thought that Norah Jones' sophomore album is subpar to her debut. However, after listening to the entire album again, and again.... and well, again, it started to sound really good. From the heavenly \\"Sunrise\\" to the really at-home melody of \\"The Prettiest Thing\\", this album is pretty much diverse. Also, the lyrics are very poetic. Unlike other artists who have CD's with pretty much only one good song and the rest, well, crappy, I gotta say, kudos to Ms. Jones. She is the true embodiment of talent... a true artist with more substance than manufactured style. Her sound is a music pot - her songs just make you feel that good.
B0000C8AVR|5.0|Bob Dylan's 1965 album Highway 61 Revisited is a masterpiece. The lyrics make perfect sense, and Bob's voice is superb unlike that Michael Jackson wannabe Justa Lumbercake who is so whiny when he sings. Why would anybody in their right mind listen to Justa Lumbercake and not this?. It's because people today don't appreciate real legends like Bob Dylan. How can you say Cry me a River is better than Desolation Row or Like a Rolling Stone or Highway 61 Revisited, you have serious issues my friend. Buy anything from Bob Dylan and ignore the cockroach Turdran reviewer and that wannabe Justa Lumbercake.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|You really know there is a serious flip-flop in the way Hollywood thinks now adays when one of the most highly anticipated films of the year is an \\"art-house\\" feature. Lost in Translation is the second directorial project from Sofia Coppola, the daughter of Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola, after her critically praised debut, The Virgin Suicides. Another rising star associated with Translation, Scarlett Johansson, has given further interest in the project thanks to her powerful performances in other art-house films like The Man Who Wasn't There and Ghost World. But if one had to pick out only one aspect that raised the most eyebrows concerning this film, it would have to be the involvement of comedian actor Bill Murray, best known for his hilarious performances in Ghostbusters and Caddyshack. Can an actor who is so embedded in the public consciousness as a comedian pull off a powerful dramatic performance? Looking back to the past for reference, the answer lies between both yes (Robin Williams) and no (Jim Carrey).<br />The story focuses on separate lifes of a struggling actor and a young woman as they cross paths and discover that everybody wants to be found. Bob Harris was once a prosperous television star but that regal star lifestyle he once had has long since past as he currently reduced to promoting whiskey in Japan. At the same time, a young woman named Charlotte is tagging along with her photographer husband but feels totally out of place as he seems to be more focused on his work then her. Both Bob and Charlotte feel they have lost what they wanted in life and don't know where to go from here. Then one night, the two cross paths in the bar of the luxury hotel in which they are staying and from there spark up a surprising friendship together. In their time together, they discover the excitement they had thought they lost in their lives and break away from the despair that had once brought them down. The story for Lost in Translation is one that, if inthe hands of another director, would have been mediocre fare but Coppola presents an atmospheric quality that keeps the feature interesting, yet at the same time thought provoking. The setting of the film in Japan is another stroke of genius considering the subject matter the feature deals with, that of necessity and happiness, which are values and topics greatly treasured in Japanese culture.<br />The cast for Translation is limited based on the number of performers but perhaps that is to its advantage as the story mainly focuses on the roles of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson. Though some questioned whether Bill Murray was qualified for this role based on his mostly comedic career, such doubts are quickly erased as he gives a memorable dramatic performance that is not without many comedic quips. Murray's deliverance of dialogue is rich with sarcasm and dark humor, which makes the performance all the more unforgettable. Scarlett Johansson gives yet another delightful performance, this time in the role of a lonely young woman who is searching for purpose in life. Johansson presents such a quality and charm about herself that one can't help but notice her where she is on screen. But it is the chemistry between Murray and Johansson enacted on the big screen that ends up complimenting both their separate performances and intensifies the overall emotional impact of the feature's story. There are few roles focused on outside of the previously mentioned duo but what is presented is a mixed bag of performances. Anna Faris, who portrays a good friend of Johansson's husband, presents as best of a performance as the material that is given to her and though her character emphasizes Charlotte's sense of loneliness with her husband caring more of her then his own wife, one begins to feel as though she is presented too much or there wasn't as much involvement with her as there could have been. The same goes to Giovanni Ribisi, Johansson's husband in the film, but at it was said before, they are not the focus of the feature and thus are less primary to the overall story, so there shouldn't be so much complaint.<br />Overall, Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation is an art-house gem that shows that companionship can be found in the most unlikely of places and gives emotional hope for those looking for it. The feature's entire emotional emphasis rides on the chemistry of Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson and it works exceedingly well, beyond what even the most star-studded major release this year has done, which gives further complimentary criticism to the duo. But, as with most films, along with the good comes the bad as well. As was said previously, the Japanese background compliments the story of the film exceptionally but at times there were awkward moments that weren't necessarily needed, such as the scene with Murray's character sitting alone in a Japanese strip club waiting for Charlotte. And the ending, though expected, left the audience with the lingering feeling of being a bit of a downer after such an emotionally uplifting story. But all-in-all, Lost in Translation rides on the shoulders of its leading stars to an emotional and fulfilling performance.
B0000DD7LB|1.0|This is so tasty. I slapped it into the microwave for five minutes and I then proceeded to devour the contents from start to end. The next morning I squatted on the porcelain throne and dropped a medium sized turd. To my complete surprise the turd bore a striking resembelance to Britney. Wow, I thought maybe this cd was interactive after all. Afterward, I decided to ingest my entire music collection to see what the results would be. I now have the largest wax(funny smelling wax)museum this side of Hollywood. Thank you Britney!
B0001AP12G|4.0|Kanye West has proved himself among the elite in the rap game.  All of the people who doubted him must feel at least a little dumb for not signing him.  On most of the songs he dominates the tracks with mad rhymes and crazy beats.  Its definately a good change from the southern rap I am accustomed to!
0316921173|3.0|I've seen a lot of people showering Infinite Jest with glowing praise, much of which claims that it \\"expands our idea of what a novel can be\\". Well, I think that the people who make these claims might actually be the butt of DFW's Infinite Jest. The fact that he doesn't actually finish the novel, but rather simply stops writing in the middle of the narrative strikes me less as some new, avant-garde stylistic mechanism, and more as a lack of discipline on the part of the writer - he simply let the story get away from him. But the other alternative, and by far the more interesting one, is that he did it on purpose for the same reason that one of his characters - Dr. Incandenza - creates a \\"new\\" style of film - to simply make fun of all the reviewers and psuedo-intellectuals who are afraid to admit that they don't understand something, and so imbue it with deep meaning when none is present. And if that's the case, then my hat's off to him, because, judging by the reviews I've read, he has succeeded admirably. <br />But don't get me wrong - it was fun to read. Much of the book is very well written, addresses a wide range of interesting topics in an intriguing way, and there are several bits that are laugh-out-loud funny. But there are also parts that are ponderously long-winded and appear to have no real connection to the \\"plot\\" (term used very loosely). I liked DFW's style up to a point, and then it appeared laboured and over self-conscious, kind of like a very bright child showing off.<br />The upshot of this is yes, it was fun to read, but it was more like reading a series of really interesting articles and short stories than a novel per se. Many will and do call this a new style - but I guess I'm just old fashioned, because it seemed too disjointed too me. It seemed to make a lie out of the line on the cover of Infinite Jest that claim it was \\"a novel\\".<br />And I don't appreciate reading through 900+ pages of someone's private joke, even when it was as funny and well written as much (not all) of Infinite Jest was.
B00005JM0B|4.0|Let's say you're an average Joe. You have your favorite sports car, a fabulous job, your own house, a beautiful wife and a great family. You go through life without a care in the world. But these things won't last. Why? Judgment Day. Imagine a world of complete darkness where man's destiny is controlled by machines and super computers. Sound familiar? It should because this is the backdrop of the entire Terminator series. The original Terminator cost an estimated $7 million but went on to gross $40 million at the box office. It became so popular on video that Terminator 2: Judgment Day was created, helmed by James Cameron. With a production budget of $100 million, T2 went on to gross $204 million, so it was a no brainer to make another sequel, right? Well, it took them 12 years and a reported $175 million budget but T3 has finally arrived in theaters just in time for the 4th of July holiday. But will Rise of the Machines continue the success of the popular franchise or will this result in its fall?<br />The story goes that the life of John Connor, the leader of the resistance movement that defeats the machines, is in danger once again. But this time he is not the only target. A T-X Terminator, the most advanced killing machine created by the Skynet network, has been sent to the year 2001 to kill the lieutenants of the future human resistance as well as John Connor himself. But John will be harder to locate because he has been living off the grid for nearly ten years. By having no cell phone, no home, and no real identity, the Skynet network is less able to track him down should the time come. Though he and his mother, Sarah Connor, prevented Judgment Day from occurring on August 29th, 1997 when they prevented the creation of the network, he still lives in fear that the end of the world still may come. He fears are correct as the T-X is looking for him but a T-850, like the one sent to kill him before he was born, has been sent by the resistance movement to ensure his survival. The events that occurred in T2: Judgment Day didn't prevent Judgment Day, it just delayed it. Within three hours, nearly 3 billion human lives will be destroyed in an instant. Now John Connor must team up with the Terminator and his future wife to try and prevent Judgment Day once again. The story for T3 is not as fabulous as the one done for T2 but with James Cameron not directing this time around, did anybody really expect it to be? Having the opening of the film focus on the thoughts of John Connor and then flash forward to a battle between machines and man was a good way to start off the picture. There are a couple of holes in the plot of the film that could have explained why certain things happen within the film but they really aren't a huge matter for the film. The ending to the film was also well done but more could have been shown.<br />The only returning cast member from Terminator 2 is Arnold Schwarzenegger reprising his role as the T-850 Terminator that he made famous nearly twenty years ago. Once again Arnold works extremely well with this role. Though more of the character was done using CGI then in the other previous films, Schwarzenegger still provides an emotional voice to the character in those types of situations. Edward Furlong, who played young John Connor in T2, was dropped from the project when the studio believed that his drug and alcohol problems would delay production, so Nick Stahl was brought in to replace him in the role. Stahl is the not the perfect replacement but still does a very good job with the character. Kristanna Loken is the new villain in the Terminator franchise playing the role of the T-X Terminator, Skynet's most sophisticated killing machine. She is very plain with her emotion which is good since she plays a machine. The only problem with her character is the questions left unanswered. Her character is made of liquid metal but at one point during the film a part of her is damaged prevent the use of a primary weapon but the film doesn't explain why this happens. But that really has more to do with the plot then with her. Claire Danes rounds out the rest of the main cast as the future wife of John Connor. There weren't that many scenes with in the course of the film that really focus on her, which is good since John is more of the focus, but most of the scenes that she was involved in were well done. The introduction of her character and the whole idea of destiny (her and John meeting and eventually getting married) was a good twist to the story.<br />Overall, Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines is a good summer popcorn film. T3 doesn't even come close to the majesty of T2 and for several reasons. The dialogue is much less serious then T2 but this was to be expected with James Cameron not at the helm this time around. The plot holes presented in the film also hurt the overall effect. There is no clear explanation on what Skynet is exactly and how it is able to control the machines if there is no core. There are also unanswered questions involving how John Connor and the Terminator are able to enter a secret military area with no problems at all. This doesn't seem to really matter as all Hell breaks loose soon after. The film is also less dramatic then the first sequel and plays more for just action and laughs but that seems to work on its own level. There were many humorous moments in the film with some working like the statements made by the T-850 replying to situations that machines can't understand. But there were also moments that didn't work. For example, the T-X inflates her breasts to get the attention of a cop who pulls her over. This was unnecessary as the cop didn't even seem to notice. Besides some minor complaints, there are many things that work for the film. The fact that Jonathan Mostow makes this his own film instead of just trying to copy what James Cameron did in T2 is fabulous. The action sequences were well done and the special effects were just absolutely amazing especially at the very end of the film. Speaking of the ending, it was a little disappointing that the film makers ended the film the way they did but that allows them to follow up with a fourth Terminator film and not give away too much. T3 may not be the best film out there but it is still a great film to enjoy over the holiday weekend.
B00018D44U|5.0|The reviews for this cd are really amazing. I have seen several reviewers recommend albumns by Britney Spears etc as alternatives since Norah's new albumn was &quot;too slow&quot;. What a joke. It is a commentary on our time when a truly talented person makes music that is so beautiful that people cannot see it for what it is. This is not pop, hip hop or rock and roll it is ageless beauty.<BR>Norah has a talent and a voice that comes along once in a lifetime if you are lucky. In the past fifty years there have only been a very few singers with her natural grace and ability. If you can listen to her and not be moved perhaps Britney Spears and Janet Jackson are right for you.
B00006IUL7|4.0|Anybody remember Memento? The independent film that critics and movie lovers in general loved so much but never got the public attention or the award recognition that it probably deserved? This wasn't so much a big deal for Newmarket, the studio that distributed the film, since the film went on to make nearly three times its budget but this has to be somewhat upsetting for the filmmakers who wanted more from their work but life goes on. The director of Memento, who is currently in the works with the new Batman project, went on to a new film called Insomnia, based on a Norwegian film of the same name. What makes this film interesting is the casting of certain roles within the film. No, its not just Al Pacino, though he does add some flavor of dramatic talent to the film, it's the casting of Robin Williams as the killer. Williams, who is best known for his comedic performances in Popeye, Aladdin and Hook, isn't the first choice that comes to mind in this area but if it works, the film could spawn a cult status on the same level as Memento.<br />The story centers on the investigation of a murder in Alaska and the cat and mouse game that the killer instigates with one of the detectives. When a teenage girl is found murdered in a small town in Alaska, a veteran police detective and his partner are sent up to over-see an official investigation. Just as the two close in on the primary suspect of the murder, the veteran detective accidentally kills his partner in a chase, believing he was the murderer. The detective then lies about the accidental homicide and gets away with it. But he soon finds out that he isn't the only living soul who saw it happen. The murderer calls up the detective, who is racked with guilt, and plans to blackmail him into letting him go free. Now the veteran police detective must choose what means more to him, his life or his commitment to justice. The story for Insomnia does a wonderful job at dealing with conflicts of the human psyche when it comesto guilt but wasn't as surprising as Memento was. But this is a small issue as it is hard to follow up to such a critical success was that film was with many critics.<br />Though the cast of Insomnia represents a wide range of actors and actresses from different performance backgrounds, it doesn't change the fact that they work perfectly together. Al Pacino in the role of the veteran detective brings the film a sense of seniority, which is a good thing in this case, and plays the character perfectly all the way to the end. He showcases a man truly racked with guilt in such a way that it allows his character to really connect with audience members without giving the end to the feature away. Even though it may seem a weird choice for the role of the killer, Robin Williams gives an impressive performance in this film. The veteran comedian seems to be really be adding up his dramatic performances with roles in other adult-oriented features like One Hour Photo and Death to Smoochy and adds to his impressive resume that includes an Oscar winning performance in Good Will Hunting. Hilary Swank, as good as she could have been in this film, isn't given much, in the area of material, that allows her to really expand her acting ability.<br />Overall, despite lack the suspense and the surprising twists of its predecessor, Memento, Christopher Nolan gives an impressive follow-up with Insomnia that stands above most cop thrillers. The problems lie in the feature's time-length, which felt longer then it should have been, and its pacing, which seemed dragged down in certain areas. The lack of usable material for smaller characters with the film, like Hilary Swank, was a shame in there was a lot of potential for several enjoyable performances but nothing developed. Other then that, Insomnia gives an engaging view into the human psyche and the effects of guilt on the subconscious combined with amazing dramatic performances from Al Pacino and Robin Williams.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|First, let me say that this is NOT the same story that is told in the fantastic novel of the same name by Gregory Maguire. If you go into this thinking you will be hearing the same story as the novel, you will be sorely dissapointed. Whereas Mr. Maguire's novel is an adult-oriented, fantasy thriller full of symbolism and sociological meaning, the book behind the play is a cheesy kids story which illustrates completely different characters (except in name), different plot lines, different messages, and differnt settings. But, for Broadway, it works, So it really needs to be judged on its own merits which is not as a politically meaningful piece of prose, but, rather, as an easy to digest, fun, and fantastic musical journey through the backstory behind Oz - albeit a much different backstory than the one which was originally portrayed in Maguire's book of the same name.<br />And that brings me to the only problem with the story - it is far too different from the book to deserve being named the same. All it does is build up false hope for the fans of the book. In fact, the stories are so much different, that they really do not even deserve to be compared. So as not to give either story away, I will not go into intricate details other than to say that the play features much more simplistic and superficial personalities and plot lines that, although enjoyable in their own right, have no underlying meaning in the grand scheme of things. They are, just as in &quot;The Wizard Of Oz&quot; movie, fluffy. But that's OK - as long as you go into it with the right attitude.<br />Alright, with all of that said, lets get to the music which is absolutely the highlight of this play. Stephen Schwartz has, once again, married Pop to Broadway with extremely melodic, wonderfully orchestrated, and thoroughly enjoyable tunes that will keep you listening to this CD for weeks at a time. I can't say that I am reminded of any of Schwartz's older works such as Godspell or Pippin, or even of hisnewer theatrical works such as Children Of Eden. Rather, I would compare the music more to Schwsartz's The Prince of Egypt or some of the Menken animated musicals, all of which I love. Of course, Broadway and Sondheim purists will turn up their noses and poo-poo at the idea of melody in musicals. But for those of us who just love to put on a CD and sing along, Wicked is one of the greats of our time.<br />As for the performances, Kristin Chenoweth and Idina Menzel deliver some of the most poewerful performances I have ever heard committed to record. Of course, Stephen Schwartz knows how to bring a song to climax and you could not find two better &quot;belters&quot; to complete the process. &quot;The Wizard And I&quot;, &quot;Popular&quot;, &quot;Defying Gravity&quot;, and &quot;No Good Deed&quot; round out the highlights of these two amazing vocalists. Also, not to be overlooked, is the performance of Joel Grey as The Wizard who gives a solid performance, although not living up to his normally dominant presence only because the rest of the cast is actually that good.<br />And, so, as you can probably tell, I was and am an immediate fan of Wicked The Musical. And to all the purists who are dedicated to the original book or to the traditional Broadway musical style, I say, in all good humor, &quot;turn down your noses, turn up the volume, and just enjoy.&quot;
B0000584V3|5.0|First off, I would like to clarify the genre that Opeth falls under.  Opeth is a black metal band and not a death metal band.  To me, calling them a death metal is a slap in the face.  Death metal sucks. As for the cd, it is wonderful.  &quot;The Drapery Falls&quot; is one of the best tracks on the cd, though it is hard to say which one is better than another.  The title track &quot;Blackwater Park&quot; is so metal.  Two minutes of instrumental build up then UGH!(w/ echos).  On a side note, I had the privlege of seeing them live last week and they are a great live band.  Have a nice day =)
B000002IOJ|4.0|When you first pop this in, you'll notice it sounds a tad different from the previous two albums.  True, Testament slowed down a bit here, not too much, but a little.  Don't let that bug ya though coz this album is quite good.  Many consider it the best along with New Order.  It's not my favorite, but it gets enough time in my cd player.  Testament would continue this sound into their next album, Souls Of BLOCK!!  Not much else to say considering it's a classic and most metal fans own it or have heard it already.  I'm gonna go make some popcorn, see ya.
B0000DYJM6|5.0|This band is not even comparable to Nirvana. For one the musical talent that pearl jam posseses is for beyond that of the former group Nirvana. Compare a mike mcready solo with curt cobain, the left hander sucks compared to macready. If you like pearl jam, or Rock and roll in general with solid song writing, pick this up cause it is like having a brand new pearl jam album.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|I think this is a wonderful film.  I just want to vent my spleen over its DVD printing.  There is a five minute forced viewing preview on the disc.  If you buy this movie, then every single time you want to watch it, you are forced to watch previews for three or four other films.  During those five minutes, you may fast forward, but you can't skip track or go directly to menu.<br />Had I known this before I purchased this DVD, I would have left it in the store.  I don't care for this trend in forced advertising.  I already spent my $20 buying this DVD, I don't think I should be forced to watch a single minute of it.
B00005QK3W|3.0|.........Probably the best release of 2001. This album is good, just not as great as the other paul albums.<BR>Some of the songs like She's Given Up Talking and Tiny Bubble make you question if Paul is losing some of his touch. But then you hear From A Lover To A Friend, Loving Flame, and Rinse The Rain Drops and say wow he has still got it. <BR>So with this album you get high peeks and low valleys, if he would have trimmed some of the worst filler out it might have been a truely great album.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Science fiction fans seem to love hard core science facts along with their fiction.  Trekkies will debate tiny errors in starship specifications (even Futurama fans argue over such details as the speed at which the line between light and darkness on the moon travels), while allowing the most glaring errors in human psychology and relationships to pass.<br />Firefly's remarkable universe filled with a cast of characters that actually act like adults engaged in realistic social relationships has to be the most refreshing science fiction in three decades (Babylon 5 included).  <br />Firefly lacks the sterility of the cold trekkien society with its single class and ridiculous utopian ideals, but neither does it fall prey to the unilateral &quot;wackiness&quot; of many character based science fiction shows.  I enjoyed the concept of a group of society's outsiders eeking a living at the edges of the known universe.  <br />Although fans have debated the technological make-up of the reality, I thought the concept that worlds with advanced technology would exist at the same time as frontier-like territories was quite realistic.  I could easilty envision the socio-economic fabric of our current world developing into such a society.     <br />Basically, Firefly wasn't like anything I had seen before.  It satisfied that part of me that enjoys watching people who act like adults handle complicated situations and complex moral dilemmas. It satisfied that part of me that loves science fiction, and as a scientist I'm pretty hard to satsify.  And finally, it satsified that part of me that likes gunfights and heroes outwitting adversaries and clever plans that go awry and space battles and a awesome looking space ships.
B00006RU5B|5.0|Chris Cornell has returned so have former members of Rage Against the Machine to make a new formation known as Audioslave now this is just a great C.D. it has all the riffs from RATM and the Emotional Voice Of Chris Cornell My Favorites Are Like A Stone, Gasoline, I Am The Highway, The Last Remaining Light, Set It Off, Chochise, Show Me How To Live this is an example of how Rock should be i just hope Audioslave unlocks the great rock beyond if you get what i am saying because most of the bands out today are trash pure trash and Audioslave is reminding them that............again i applaud this album but this if you dare listen to some great rock Best Rock Album Of 2002

B0001AP12G|1.0|The fact that reviewers are giving this album five stars and claiming how it's a move for hip hop in the right direction just shows how sorry hip hop has become over the last decade. Maybe if I could only compare it to 50 Cent, Eminem, and Dr. Dre recrods, I might think it was spectacular too. But come on people-REALLY-this album is trash. Just because somebody is not rapping about \\"guns\\" and \\"ho's\\" does not make rapping about \\"sex\\" and \\"drug dealing\\" any more upstanding. But even more desperate than that is how West constantly throws \\"material things\\" in our face to prove how he's made it. The whole point of the album seems to be that those with money are \\"in\\" and everybody else is just some sucker trying to hold him back. The multiple 'drop out of school' and be like me skits are unfunny and downright stupid. <BR>Man I remeber when people said that groups like Willie D(from the Geto Boys) were trash, but at least he had the decency to make a song called \\"Go Back to School\\". Kanye West has a whole nutha agenda. He would love for everyone to become uneducated idiots like himself. In theory, I guess it makes perfect sense-cause only a brain-dead zombie would spend $15 bucks on a cd like this.<br />Dumbed down for the masses-that's what this music is. Kanye's buddy Twista is in the same category. But don't think I'm just flat-out hating. I actually thought Twista's(tung Twista's) first album-RUNNIN OFF AT DA MOUTH-was good. But if you sat down and compared it to his new garbage, then you would see how these guys have spent a little too much time over the past few years listening to Cash Money and Jay-Z albums.<br />BRING BACK REAL HIP HOP>  cause this sure as hell ain't it!
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Clearly this film has polarized people's opinions, but I can't help but look at some of the 'reviews' people have contributed with disbelief.<br />We all have a subjective response to a film, but if you are trying to write a review which is of any use to anyone, chalking up one star and telling people to avoid it like the plague is just ludicrous.  If you think this films deserves to be ranked alongside the worst you have ever seen (&quot;Batman and Robin&quot; please take a bow) you're either not getting out much, or your viewing is restricted to the classics!   <br />Two believeable, thoughtful, flawed characters are allowed room to experience doubt as they try to make sense of their place in the world.  A relationship develops which is unforced, believable and very touching.  I felt the film was handled with a deftness of touch which is all too rare in Hollywood.  Rather than forcing contrived action and neat resolutions on the audience it seems to reflect the experiences you bring with you into the cinema.  Perhaps it is the people who bring nothing who have trouble taking anything away with them.<br />With regard to accusations of racism, I think you have to be looking for it.  My impression of the Japanese on screen was that they were polite, friendly, and have a wonderful sense of fun, even if it can seem bewildering to Western eyes.  Having only seen the country on a day long stopover, I'd love to spend some time there. <br />This film has resonated very deeply with a number of people, including myself.  It is insulting to suggest that these people are simply professing to love it out of a desire to appear 'intellectual', and ridiculous to think that they are influenced by the name of the director's father.  If we'd all &quot;done ourselves a favour&quot; and given this a miss we'd have lost out on a wonderful cinematic experience.<br />If you are prepared for a thoughtful study of our relationship with the world and the people around us, I suggest you ignore the vitriol and give it a go.  Even if you can't see what all the fuss is about now, maybe one day you will.  And if you really think this is bad, well, its only a couple of hours long, and Bad Boys III will be along soon.
B000065U1N|5.0|Black Hawk Down, after I saw the movie became my favorite war movie right in front of &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot;. The movie is about a group of rangers and delta force souldiers who were sent to Mogadishu, Somalia in October, 1993. For a mission that was supposed to take only 45 minutes, turned into a chaotic 16-hour war of survival, Sgt. Eversman will do whatever it takes to get his men out of this war zone.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|In response to &quot;A Viewer&quot; from VT below - you posted a near identical comment on February 13 under the pseudonym &quot;Projek A&quot;.  I think that to keep revisiting this site under different names to keep banging the &quot;racist&quot; drum in the guise of a review is a little worrying.  <br />As I said below my impression of the Japanese in this film was very positive.  I think you have to accept though that the film is a story of alienation, told from the viewpoint of characters in the throes of culture shock, jet lag, and existential doubt.  If we are seeing the world interpreted through them it is bound to be painted in broad stokes.  I don't believe this film sold itself as an exploration of Japan's very rich culture, it is simply the background and context for an examination of the main protagonists feelings.
0385504209|1.0|Yeah I read &quot;The DaVinci Code&quot; Wanted to know what all the fuss was about.  No question it IS a page turner.  You will finish it quickly.  I also read fairy tales quickly when I was a kid. The story is a fantasy.  In fact the entire &quot;wild goose chase&quot; in the book takes place in France and England, through the Louvre, hyper secure Swiss banks, french countrysides, English airports, the Westminster Abbey, you name it -- all -- in less than 24 hours.  Go figure.  Paleese!  Look I'm not shocked or insulted over the religious &quot;revelations&quot; but give me a break...make the darn story feasible!  A total waste of time.  Save your money.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Some albums instantly reveal that they just might be something special or even classic upon a mere first listen or two. However, in many cases albums that have earned classic status have demanded additional attention and multiple listens before their greatness was fully realized and ultimately acknowledged. In the case of Wilco's 2002 release, Yankee Hotel Foxtrot, a combination of both of these scenarios are at work.  Several years removed from their alt-country past, Wilco delivered a record that is more readily accessible than say Radiohead's 1997 masterwork, OK Computer (the other record that Foxtrot is often compared to) and one that never crumbles under its weighty material moving strength to strength behind the band's noise inflected, sometimes languid but always intriguing songs. <br />The recurring bleak tone that at times dominates the album is exemplified in what is quite possibly the album's most effective track, Radio Cure: cheer up, honey I hope you can/there is something wrong with me...picking apples for the kings and queens of things I've never seen/distance has no way of making love understandable, sings vocalist Jeff Tweedy in a voice that sounds both detached and weary. In fact, sans some of the production techniques, Radio Cure would not sound at all out of place on Big Star's legendary album, Sister Lovers. Though the lethargic pace of some of the material may put off some listeners at first, it's the album's strong pop base and the continued discovery of unique, idiosyncratic sonic sounds and overall production \\"effects\\" liberally dispersed throughout the record that makes Foxtrot such a successful and compelling listen. This is not to say that the album is never uptempo or uplifting (Kamera, Jesus, Etc.) or that it doesn't have its straight pop moments (like the somewhat trite Heavy Metal Drummer) it's just that in many cases those moments are usually accompanied by and immersed in the crackling atmospheric  production din of the album (PoorPlaces, I Am Trying To Break Your Heart). However, that's a positive for an album that doesn't really \\"rock\\" in the traditional sense but more than compensates with its unique sound collages that are never delivered heavy-handedly but injected discriminately whether it's via the Can-like flowing aural landscape in War On War, the fleshed-out horns employed toward the end of I'm The Man Who Loves You or the lonely, desolate guitar riff that is the centerpiece of Ashes Of American Flags. All of these things contribute to making Foxtrot the stellar album that it is. To quote one of the many outstanding songs on this album, every song is a comeback, indeed and with this release Wilco have produced one of the more extraordinary albums in recent memory making Foxtrot a measuring stick for many modern alternative rock albums hoping to claim the tag of \\"landmark album.\\"

B00003CX97|5.0|The 1957, Bridge On The River Kwai, is a W.W.II film loosely based on a novel written about true life events. William Holden, as Major Shears, has escaped from a Japanese POW camp where Alec Guinness, as Colonel Nicholson, is the ranking British officer.  The cruel and fanatical Colonel Saito (Sessue Hayakawa) has been put in charge of constructing a railroad bridge over a river important to the Japanese.  Saito and Nicholson struggle over using officers to help build the bridge. Saito uses vicious and brutal punishment in an attempt to break Nicholson, but the colonel never gives in. A compromise is reached and Nicholson persuades his men to build the bridge is a very short time.  Meanwhile, Major Shears makes his way through the jungle and back to a base. He provides information about the bridge, but he truly wants to go home. He is forced into volunteering to guide a mission back into the camp to destroy the bridge.  The leader is Major Warden (Jack Hawkins) who is very gun ho. When the two story lines mess, there is an exciting climax. Director David Lean uses the jungle scenery of Sri Lanka to appeal to the peace behind the madness of war. This film portrays the psychological effect of war on men and seems to place all men on the same level, regardless of country. It nominated for eight Academy Awards and won seven, including Best Picture, in 1957.  A truly gripping story with beautiful scenery, it’s a classic epic that is a pleasure to watch.
B0000C8AVM|5.0|It may seem silly from the perspective of 30 years later, but at the time of &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; release, Bob Dylan fans were in near-despair because it had been about 7 years since he had put out an album worthy of his reputation.  After his famous motorcycle accident, he issued a series of albums that appealed to many fans (I love &quot;John Wesley Harding&quot; and &quot;Nashville Skyline&quot;) but disappointed many others.  His reunion with the Band led to a successful tour, but a tour that seemed primarily to be about nostalgia.  Dylan was over.<br />Then this album arrived, and it seemed like a miracle.  Dylan was back! Solid writing, beautiful and subdued arrangements, great singing, powerful emotions articulated in a way that was every bit as poetic as we'd come to expect from Dylan, but without all the masks, jokes and obscurity. Not only did &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; satisfy the Dylan fans, it penetrated even the casual fan with its vivid depictions of memory, love and loss.<br />Time has only improved &quot;Blood on the Tracks.&quot;  I find it harder to listen to some of his 60s classics.  There are a lot of great songs, but they aren't consistent, and the performances are too slapdash. Listening to &quot;Blonde on Blonde&quot; in the car the other day, my son mocked me, saying &quot;if I sang like that, you'd make me stop,&quot; and unfortunately, he's right.  &quot;Blood on the Tracks&quot; does not ask you to make allowances like that.  It's beautiful and will stand the test of time.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|I was inspired to write this review when i noticed that one of the other reviewers wished that time could be turned back so that (s)he could have gone to this gig - well .... <br />I was at Slane, Co. Meath, Ireland that bright sunny scorching day in August 2003.<br />My first visit to Slane Castle, which has been hosting these one day outdoor concerts since the early 1980's, when Thin Lizzy set the ball rolling, was very memorable. The line up for the day was one of the best in years:<br />Red Hot Chili Peppers<BR>Foo Fighters<BR>Queens of the Stone Age<BR>Feeder<BR>P.J. Harvey<BR>Morcheeba<BR>Halite<br />The 80,000 ticket event sold out in about 2 hours on the day the tickets were released (at 59.50 a pop thats 4,760,000 or $6,022,000 straight off the bat!!!!!!!!)<br />The anticipation was immense and the day didn't disappoint. Firstly because apart from light drizzle briefly during Morcheeba's set early in the day, the sun was out and scorched the earth until sunset and if you are familair with Ireland at all, it could very easily have been the exact opposite and washed everyone into the river behind the stage!<br />The Chili Peppers played a blinder - i hadn't seen them since they played in 1995 on the &quot;One Hot Minute&quot; tour with Dave Navarro (Of Jane's Addiction) on guitar. <br />They were really fired up and the audience was too! THe stage was brilliant and you might notice during the course of the DVD that &quot;Bullet Time&quot; photography - as seen in the Matrix - is employed every now and again through the course of the concert, a really wonderful touch that made me double take and play the sequence over again to see whether i was dreaming or not.<br />They played a set mostly comprised of their last two records, a few tracks from Blood Sugar, and a number of covers - the highlight of which, for me, was a cover of the Ramones excellent tune &quot;Havana Affair&quot;.<br />Well woth buying and a big seller in Ireland for nostalgia purposes.<br/>If you like this, also check out the Foo Fighters DVD &quot;Everywhere but Home&quot;, as it features two tracks recorded at this Slane concert, split screened with backstage footage.<br />P.S. I only hope Queens of the Stone Age recorded their set, as it was an utter stomper and the audience went wild!
B00005JKG9|4.0|This is an insightful movie into what motivates in a sales environment.  Baldwin coming in with a sales contest after Jack Lemmon was such a successful sales employee for so many years.  It developed the 'what have you done for me lately' syndrome in business.<br />What you wonder is there any opportunity for someone who has been a successful sales person in his or her career and who has brought in business and more than paid for him/herself, then, because of short term thinking, loses his job.<br />Lemmon suddenly becomes a washout, you feel the desparation of him and the bad feelings of his associates as his career implodes.<br />Akin to the reengineering of American business and the increase in production required in the postal system, you feel the effect on all involved.  Baldwin is akin to the college educated drivers who push postal service employees to do more and more in a mundane environment.  A bit surreal, the movie shows the heartlessness of business.  It is just that, business, no feeling, no heart.<br />The movie reminds me of survivor, where only one person leaves the office.  Yet, what happens each month thereafter?  You are left wondering what happens next.<br />You wonder, what things should be done in a sales environment such as this for the employees to achieve success.  This movie is pre-internet, so things are slightly different today.<br />One thing about this movie, it is relevant in todays economic climate.  Do people matter when it comes to business?  Eventually the law of diminishing returns will come to haunt us as a people as we continue to export jobs for the sake of business.  Eventually, you would think, who will be there to buy what is made overseas?  Of course, India, China and Russia, where the jobs are going.  Let's have a sales contest.
B000002UYZ|3.0|Yes an amazing collection of early beatles classis .... but still why the two cds when it can be fit on only one .... The WHO's Tommy is now on one cd , even though it is 74 mins long ...<BR>    This is an unfair policy of the record company to sell it on two cds when it can all be fit on one .. Well what to say being a great bealtes i had to purchase it and fill the gaps in my cd collestion ... :)<BR>     5 Stars for the music .... But  2 stars for putting it on two cds...
0800179501|5.0|I love this movie and it's era.  No movie today can give you the same affect as this movie can (except for maybe Rocky).  The music score done flawlessly by Bill Conti and the chemistry between all the actors.  Back then people loved \\"against the odds\\" kind of movies and Karate Kid delivered wonderfully.<br />Of course if this movie was to come out today, kids would laugh and scoff at it because they would prefer to see blood, sex and stupid humor (see Road Trip).  Sigh, to go back in time and sit in a movie theater...
B0000VD04M|5.0|Tim Burton's masterpiece Ed Wood was to be released on February 10th, chock full of special features including commentary.  My question is: WHERE IS IT??

B0000942LT|1.0|Well it seems as though staind have opted for the same verse-chorus-verse-bridge-chorus formula which made the very rich men with break the cycle. its a safe bet and provides them with yet more money, i have nothing against staind, in fact a couple of songs of dysfunction and &quot;btc&quot; were very good, but you do tend to get bored of the same set of songs being played in de-tuned guitars.  As soon as i heard pay to play i knew they wouldnt be repeating the success of &quot;btc&quot;. Most of this album is dull, the title is fitting and aarons droning becomes frankly annoying after a while. songs like intro and fill me up raise the eyebrow slightly and falling down sounds like it should be on btc. the album doesnt quite grab you and its quite disturbing that a man of this age is so angry and depressed.  Maybe theyll get another album out if theyre not dropped. once again im not out to get staind this review is true.
B000088E6D|5.0|Ok, I admit I stumbled on this CD by accident.  I had seen the CD cover and thought he looked like Justin Timberlake.  I am a HUGE Justin Timberlake fan, if that gives you any indication of my music tastes.  Not knowing what to expect, I listened to the CD in the store.  I immediately fell in love.  Michael Buble has a rich, velvety voice that is smooth as butter.  He's pretty easy on the eyes too!  I bought this CD 5 days ago, and I seriously can't get enough.  It's all I listen to and I sing his songs to myself all day long.  I absolutely adore this man's voice!  I wish I could hear him perform live.  I have raved about this CD to all my friends and family in the last 5 days, and I can't recommend it highly enough.  I am about to turn 30, so I didn't grow up listening to this type of music, but I definitely have an appreciation for it when Michael Buble sings.  This is one CD that I, my mother, and my grandmother will all enjoy.

B00009XITP|2.0|Once upon a time, Colin Firth played a character named Tommy Judd and said things like \\"All problems solved for life. No commies and no queers\\". Then he grew up to be Mr. Darcy. There were different roles in between and beyond. But one has to wonder what are you doing in this movie, Mr. Firth? To give the movie some class? Perhaps. Or to get the mothers to go to see it with their daughters? Or Maybe Mr. Firth has his children's tuitions to pay. But being Mr. Firth, he did a fantastic job playing Lord Dashwood. Never mind the leather pants, someone has to do it. He is no doubt a true professional, always delivers. If it was not for Mr. Firth, I would have missed a lesson in the bad movie making. Ms. Bynes! What can I say? She is so FAKE, it is just painful to see her act adorable, cute and etc. There are very talent young actresses, she is not one of them. I hope she will improve over the years. IT is such a shame that the supporting cast is just wonderful. What a waste of talents for such a movie. IS the movie industry to be blamed for giving such junk to the younger movie goers or the other way? I just realized how lucky I was to watch Mr. Firth playing Tommy Judd when I was a teenager.
B0000B1OFL|3.0|Look, this is a very solid and professionally produced motion picture, and if all you are seeking is a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours, this film will do as well as most.  But the fact is, we really have seen it all before.  In the case of this film, literally, being an inferior remake of the 1969 version starring Michael Caine (though, to be fair, the plots are quite different).  There isn't anything truly wrong with the film.  The chase scenes are expertly performed, the suspense is just right, the gimmicks engaging and interesting, and, for the most part, the cast highly entertaining.<br />So why did I feel a bit let down afterwards?  Well, in part because of Mark Wahlberg.  Three things kept running through my mind as I watched him.  One was that he is absolutely terrible compared to Michael Caine's job playing Charlie Kroker.  Caine is one of the great actors in recent decades in the movies, while Wahlberg is pretty much this year's flavor.  A second thing was that the great Jason Statham, who plays Handsome Rob in the film, would have been an infinitely better Charlie Kroker than Wahlberg (maybe its the Cockney accent he has in common with Michael Caine).  Finally, as I listened to Wahlberg flatly deliver one line after another in a dull monotone, it occurred to me that he is clearly one of the worst actors in the world.  Either that or he is content to sleepwalk through a part.  I ought to add that he was surprisingly good in THREE KINGS, though I haven't seen him in anything that was especially well done since.<br />The rest of the cast, thankfully, is much better, though no one is really given much of an opportunity to put their acting skills on display.  Charlize Theron is one of the best actresses in the movies when given a role that draws out her skills (like MONSTER, which should net her an Oscar in a couple of days).  She isn't just a pretty face.  Jason Statham is fine in his rather undemanding role.  I would love to see him in a really dark and bleak film.  I am not sure how wide his range is, but I would like to find out.  Edward Norton is a great actor, but his part, like most of the others, didn't call at all upon his considerable talents.<br />I did enjoy seeing Donald Sutherland in his brief but key role as John Bridger, the safe cracker who is also the father of Stella (Charlize Theron).  Sutherland starred with Julie Christie in one of the most famous films ever set in Venice, Nicholas Roeg's 1973 DON'T LOOK BACK.  I couldn't help think of that in the various shots that demonstrated that it really was Vienna.<br />By the way, in one scene where you can see Steve Frezelli's (Edward Norton's character) widescreen TV through an outside window, you can definitely see Michael Caine's image on it for a second or so.<br />In short, this is a slickly made film that didn't require much of the actors and doesn't demand much on the part of the viewer.  If one watches it with minimal expectations, one might enjoy it.and bleak film.  I am not sure how wide his range is, but I would like to find out.

0446310786|5.0|This novel is set in Maycomb, Alabama, in the 1930's. The story is told from the eyes of a young girl. Jean Louis Finch, also called Scout has to go through a lot of adversity during the time that her father, Atticus, has to defend a black man, Tom Robinson. The story has many hidden lessons about growing up and doing what is right. Tom Robinson is wrongly tried for the rape of Mayella Ewell. He is wrongly convicted just because of his coler even though everyone knew he was innocent. It's a sad event that Scout and Jem (her older brother) had to go though. Throughout the book the kids have many other interesting adventures that make this book fun to read. Like when they try harassing their mysterious neightbor that they nick name &quot;Boo&quot; Radley. Their curiosity almost gets them shot one time while they were trying to get a glimpse of Boo in one of his windows. They think that Boo is a monster and their imaginations get the best of them as to how he really is. In the end of the book, the kids come face to face with Boo, and its not the way they though they would.
B00005YW4H|5.0|It has taken me ten months to finally review this cd. Why? Well, I thought I was going to get sick of it...you know, when you first get a cd you play it over and over again...eventually it moves to the back of your music rotation. This cd still sits on my desk at work and is played in its entirety at least three times a week...sometimes all in one day. There isn't a track I skip. That's rare for me. I would think that is rare for most listeners. With her new cd &quot;Feels Like Home&quot; on the rack and getting all the attention, I thought a current review of this 'old' one would help anyone who is discovering Ms. Jones for the first time with her new cd. <br />Every track is exquisitely produced...not overproduced...which is extremely important in order to showcase a voice that is expressive way beyond her years. There is real raw emotion, depth and range on this cd. <br />Another reviewer suggested some early Norah Jones via The Peter Malick Group....I'm listening to that right now as I write this review. I am so glad I took that reviewers suggestion. In fact, I bought the Malick cd instead of &quot;Feels Like Home&quot;. If you are a true Norah Jones fan you must get the Malick Group work. It seems like possibly she is being reined in on her 'commercial' cds in order to appeal to a broader audience. Not so with the Malick project. It is raw Norah.<br />&quot;Come Away With Me&quot; is certain to remain in the front of your cd library if not in your cd rack for a long time....and, rightly so. Sit back and enjoy..this artist is going to be fill your soul...
B00018D44U|2.0|Much of what made Norah Jones's first CD interesting is missing from this follow-up CD.  Perhaps too many of the songs were written by or with Lee Alexander; (Jesse Harris, who won a Grammy for his &quot;Don't Know Why&quot; on Jones's _Come Away With Me_ CD, doesn't appear)there's less of a jazz-aware sensibility and more of a country - not exactly sure sensibility in this one.  Her next effort needs more musical exploration, more tension, and more feeling, or listeners are going to start believing that they've got all the Norah Jones they need.
044022165X|2.0|Most Grisham novels are true thrillers: they're entertaining stories with enough plot twists to keep you up past your bedtime.  Of course, the protagonist's fate is never in doubt, but he/she certainly takes a long time in getting there.<br />&quot;The Rainmaker,&quot; however, is not a thriller by any means.  Yes, it's an engaging -- sometimes even moving -- story about the search for justice against an amoral insurance company.  But Grisham seemingly wrote the novel with an axe to grind, and this moral agenda prevents the novel from becoming a truly great, make-your-heart-skip-suspense-tale we've come to expect from the author of &quot;The Client&quot; and &quot;The Firm.&quot;  <br />Three criticisms:<br />1. The plot is too black &amp; white<br />&quot;The Rainmaker&quot; moves from one event to another in a near linear fashion -- there's no surprise revelation, no complicating obstacle that places the outcome of the case in doubt.  The protagonist, Rudy Baylor, simply gets one lucky break after another and faces no setbacks at all in taking down the evil insurance company.  <br />2. Side-plots and characters are abandoned instead of being woven into the fabric of the story-line<br />Even the most promising side-stories (Rudy's shady boss, his landlady's will), are slowly abandoned out of convenience somewhere in the middle instead of being skillfully integrated into the main storyline (as Grisham has so wonderfully done in the past).  Characters richly characterized in the beginning -- like Rudy's best friend Booker -- are virtually forgotten, only to be picked up again at the *very* end when Grisham realizes he's forgotten to mention them.  <br />3. Great development in the beginning; virtually nothing in the end<br />Finally, the pacing is off: there's so much rich depth in the first 200 pages as the author develops Rudy and fosters reader loyalty (you really do root for him and cheer as he triumphs).  There's all kinds of great background information, the pace is thoughtful and deliberate throughout...then Grisham crams together a conclusion in a rather thin 10-page spread near the end.<br />All in all, an entertaining narrative about a fictional insurance company getting its just punishment -- but certainly not a Grisham &quot;thriller&quot; by any means, and thus, a disappointment.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Do not watch this movie unless: 1. You adore Bill Murray's goofy face trying to act jaded but looking, well, just goofy 2. You love watching long scenes of people looking out windows, up at ceilings, and into space 3. You crave movies that go nowhere and get there very slowly 4. You enjoy seeing the Japanese made to look small, silly, fawning, and extremely uncool. This movie has some laughs, at the expense of the Japanese. One sight gag is that Murray looms over the Japanese in an elevator. His supercilious glances downward say it all: He is the cool, tall American and they are funny little foreign people.

0060531053|4.0|I'm a beginning brewer. This book came highly recommended by several websites and brewing forums. So I picked this book up.<br />It's a thorough book and has been updated recently as the Introduction notes.<br />Overall it was a good book for a beginner but there are some problems.<br />First, the beginning chapters really barrel through the process so quickly that you're not sure what some of the terminology means.  For instance, Pitching.  Which is simply a brewer's word for dumping in the yeast.  You'll hear the term used through several chapters before you even have a clue what it means.  Another is sparging.  Which is another brewer's term for straining the spent finishing hops and other stuff out of the beer.<br />As you can see I've read the entire book and I'm still uncertain of terms and when they are applied.  He finally explains those two previously mentioned phrases and many more in the latter half of the book but by that time I was already confused and asking myself what the heck do those words mean? So much so that I don't really think the meanings set in completely for the last half of the book.  This could just be my brain hiccupping (no pun intended) or maybe a flaw in the book.  You'd have to decide for yourself.  I finally noticed the Appendix in the back containing a glossary.  *Sigh*  oh well.<br />Second, this is probably the most annoying part of the book for me.  He has a motto that he WAY overuses in the book.  Every few paragraphs he spouts off this silly motto.... \\"Relax. Don't worry. Have a homebrew\\"<br />Doesn't seem like much but after reading it about 200 times in the book I was tempted to black that stupid phrase with a marker.  For as many times as he had that in the book he could have put a quick glossary at the beginning to help us newbies to understand the terms he uses and doesn't explain until after he goes over the brewing process. Can you tell I despise that saying?<br />Now to the good points of the book.<br />The book is very thorough with some great recipes and knowledge about where beers come from and what kind is what as well as how they are made.  And how to make every single one of these brews.  It's an invaluable resource for recipes and little tips on homebrewing and some of the pitfalls. Giving many tips and tricks on how to avoid screwing up your first few batches.<br />He also gives great explanations on the types of Hops, yeast, grains, and sugars.  There are so many your head will spin but he manages to keep you grounded with simple knowledge and easy explanations.<br />This is definitely a book you'll want in your brewing library.  Just remember the first time he mentions Pitching or any term you don't understand.  Flip to the glossary on pg.315 and educate yourself.  Don't wait for him to explain it.  And you'll be fine<br />Relax. Don't worry. Have a homebrew!  *shiver*th some great recipes and knowledge about where beers come from and what kind is what as well as how they are made.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|And that is exactly what Joss Whedon gave us in this adventurous series called \\"Firefly\\".  You can call it a crossing of western and sci-fi motifs, but the show is really about the characters that live aboard the fine ship 'Serenity'.  When I first saw this show on TV I saw something that was unique in its crossing of genres and the humor and twists in plot that are typical of Joss Whedon's genius.  Nothing else on television is like it.   Some try to compare it to Star Trek, which gives us \\"alien-of-the-week\\" type stories and is very sterile.  Firefly is dirty, suspenseful, sexy, adventurous, and funny and watching it makes me really care about the people in it.  I am so glad that the DVD set came out so quickly after it was cancelled so that I can enjoy this great show.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|Being a Beatle fan since age 5, I always watch &amp; listen to the fab four whenever I can. As their work evolved into something else, I've tuned in...greatly appreciated George's expertise to involve the sitar etc. But this concert provides a lot more. Eric Clapton &amp; the other performers couldn't have done it better!

B00008WT49|2.0|Thin, bland instrumentals with monotonous arrangements that don't seem to accompany Norah Jones so much as just happen to be playing while she's singing.  Her voice has an interesting, appealing quality that is not very effectively supported or shown off.  The mixing seemed unbalanced with her voice too prominent like she was singing in your ear while the band was playing out on the patio.  I think a triple shot espresso might have help her near comatose delivery.  Did no one noticed during the recording of this album that a collection of elevator music was being produced?  The multi-channel track of the sacd version was horribly mixed.  Was everything below 80 hz intentionally left out?  I gave this album 2 stars instead of 1 because it is better than Brittany Spears.  I've listened several times to see what I missed that maked this Grammy material.  I can't figure it out.
B00005NC66|1.0|This movie is full of a bunch of slow moving character developments. There's a bunch of long dialogues between men and women that are very drab and superficial. People tell me to watch this film for the amazing jump cut edits...well I did and big deal. Let's face it this guy is no Scorcese when it comes to doing innovative stuff with the camera, writing compelling scripts, and getting a likable cast up on the screen. Personally I think this guy just writes films for film school types and completely ignore us the audience.
B00008WT49|4.0|I was incredibly disappointed in this album.  But after I fiddled with my settings, I'm feeling quite different now.  I have a Denon 1700 A/V receiver and the new entry-level Pioneer universal DVD player DV-563a.  So for anyone who is having difficulting getting the bass information in the sacd multi-channel playback, make sure you're receiver is in digital mode even though you must use the multi-channel analog inputs.  <br />Anyway, now that I'm hearing it as it was intended, I finally understand the all the excitement.  I still feel the vocals are too prominent, but only a tad.  It is quite stunning once user idiocy is overcome. The only thing that may have made it better is if more challenging material had been choosen.  I don't think Norah Jones is using all of her vocal ability and a bit of energy in her phrasing would be nice.  <br />In summary, I'm glad I sent the time to work it all out.  Norah Jones has an appealing, warm voice, and I look forward to hearing it mature.
B00006RINF|5.0|I love Lacuna Coil but unfortunately, its only been a few months since I first heard them. They write absolutely beautiful songs and Christinas voice is gorgeous. I admit that I heard Evanescence first and liked Fallen, despite having heard OF Lacuna Coil first, I just couldnt find any of their cd's anywhere, but in all honesty, the only similarity between the two bands is the fact that both have female vocalists and since the point of these reviews is to state your opinion on Lacuna Coil I really cant see why it is necessary to diss Evanescence here, do that on their reviews. Anyway, Lacuna Col deserve to be big and this is a stunning album and I was upset when I couldnt get to a gig in London recently. A great cd to sing along to, and one I can listen to for ages on repeat.
B00006RU5B|4.0|One thing that must be said about this album is that it is an incredible display of talent. That said, not everybody is going to like it. Two bands have come together. And while Cornell may be the only one representing Soundgarden, he's also the frontman which means his influence cannot be questioned. This album is without a doubt much more similar to Soundgarden than it is to Rage Against the Machine. That's either a good thing or a bad thing depending on which band you preferred. I've never liked rap music, so for me it's a great thing. I always loved the instrumentals on the Rage albums, but Zach's rapping just didn't do it for me. So for me this album was like cutting out the fat. All that remains is goodness! If you were a big fan of the rapping (or the politics) of Rage, this album may not be for you. However, it's still worth a listen. I do know a few Rage fans who like it, though most of the fans I know preferred Soundgarden's work. And Morello's genius is still very apparent on this album. The first single &quot;Cochise&quot; truly sounds like a cross between the two bands, making it a superb choice to open the album. &quot;Like A Stone&quot; is something to behold, though I liked it more when it hadn't become a single and it was like my buried treasure that no one else knew about. While the other singles (&quot;Show Me How to Live&quot; and &quot;I am the Highway&quot;) are both really excellent, I think perhaps my favorite song on the album is &quot;Shadow on the Sun.&quot; It seems so calm and peaceful, and then loud and powerful, accessible, yet not poppy. It's truly perfect. This album has some filler though, particularly in the latter half. Still, this is a debut album and the next one promises to be even better. Enjoy!

B0000VCZK2|1.0|I am a HUGE fan of all 4 of these movies, but this set is a fiasco:<br />1) Thin, tinny disks that are flawed and freeze even in the latest players.<BR>2) Scratched disks from the factory.<BR>3) Cheap digipak packaging that falls apart and has sharp edges to scratch your disks unless you take the utmost care when seating them back in the package.<BR>4) A digipack holding 9 disks that takes about 5 feet to open out fully unfolded!  Rediculous!! This may seem OK at first, but gets old real quick.  Also, this opening and folding to access disks damages the cases very easily.<br />ONE STAR FOR THE PACKAGING. IT SELLS BECAUSE PEOPLE FALL FOR THE HYPE AND IT SELLS CHEAPER THAN BUYING THEM INDIVIDUALLY.<br />My recommendation is to shop around for the best prices and buy all 4 in the Collector Series two-disk sets.  The disks are heavier and seem of better quality. They are not scratched, nor do they freeze up.  The packaging is still digipak, but at least these only open to two disks rather than 9.  The artwork is much nicer too.  If you just have to have a 9th disk, buy the &quot;Alien Saga&quot; which is much more entertaining than the Quad 9th disk anyway.  However, with the 2nd disk with each movie, you really don't need the additional info.
B000084T18|5.0|I agree with you about how good the CD is... but Vanilla Ice and 50 Cent? I think not. Maybe you should change your name to MusicalIdiot. Vanilla Ice hasn't been around since his first and last CD came out and he was publicly destroyed in the rap game. And there is no way that 50 would join up with his long time rival Ja Rule to produce anything. So before you go around claiming you're a genius about ANYTHING, check your stats. It's busters like you who put these classic rap albums to shame. Next thing you'll be saying is Jay-Z is teaming up with Shaquille O'Neal on his next single. So at least get the info right.
B00012FXB8|5.0|My least favorite of the 4 Alien movies, but still outstanding Scifi and a must to follow the story of the series. Excellently made two disk set with outstanding extras.
B00011RPB0|5.0|Two Americans visiting Tokyo meet: \\"Lost in Translation\\" is about the relationship that evolves between them, how they adjust to Japanese culture, and the disconnect between each and their respective spouses.<br />There are numerous scenes we see the disconnect between Japanese and Americans: Bob Harris towering over the Japanese men in the elevator,  Harris as a guest on the talk show, the prostitue that visits his hotel room, the misunderstandings that happen when the Japanese invert their L's and R's.<br />But note how often what is 'lost in translation' is between the Americans themselves.  Both Harris and Charlotte feel disconnected from their American, English-speaking spouses.<br />Lastly, I really enjoyed seeing a love story that didn't become sexual.  A bond occured between an older man and a young woman.  That is the love story, and it was a stronger love story than I've seen in most movies.
B00012FXAE|5.0|This is the best Science Fiction movie ever made, and the two disk set is outstanding in every way.  It offers beautiful packaging, two movies (theatrical and Special Ed), and a bonus behind the scenes disk.  Highly recommended.
B00006BTCA|4.0|I hate to write a second review for this so I won't, I'll just address the people reviewing this...<br />How can this possibly receive 1 star? Listen to it. It sounds good. The sound is fresher than most stuff made today. These are true statements.<br />Others give it 1 star because it is so derivative. Yeah, maybe... but does that make it terrible? Hardly. Most bands today don't even hope to have decent source material; they're busy trying to make retarded rhymes or sound disturbed... some are so lame they even name themselves things like &quot;Disturbed&quot;. Interpol is not as awful as all that.<br />OK, now to address the &quot;this is the best thing since orgasms&quot; crowd. Wrong again. All of the &quot;It's derivative&quot; people do have a point. Can you see that? This stuff sounds so much like 80's postpunk that it makes all of us over 25 go back and pull out the original 80's postpunk bands. Do not try to hide from this fact or bury it and say it's untrue. Nothing that is so closely connected to its source material can be ascribed the 'best ever' label.<br />Others have said that it's the only album in their vast collection that they can listen to start to finish. Well 10 CDs ain't exactly vast then. I've got over 200 that I'm happy to go coast-to-coast with... and yes, this is one of them. Interpol is very good all the way through.<br />In sum, let's not overreact or exaggerate so much that we all look foolish. If you like it that much then a 5-star rating makes sense, but it just isn't the best album ever made. And it sure isn't the worst... Haven't you guys heard Milli Vanilli or Loverboy?
B000000993|5.0|Lets work with what we have.  The most obvious truth and fact is that Tool is a very well composed band who is goes above the status of music.  We expect to be entertained by a cd even maybe relate to it in some sort of way but tool actually moves you.  It gets to you and you some how are emotionally involved in this state of art.  It may take someone a day to let the message of the music sink in; to others it might take a week however long it takes you, it's worth it!  Undertow was and still is an awesome cd that I believe everyone show purchase.  Any being can learn a thing or two from pain and failures.  UNDERTOW is a great cd I advise everyone to buy it.  Although, tool is not for everyone.
B000002UA2|4.0|I had high hopes for this album considering it was recorded between Meddle and Dark Side of the Moon. The songs are varied and pretty peculariar, actually. the album starts off with a cool synth dirge, Obscured by Clouds. then it kicks into an annoying instrumental, When You're In. i hate this song, it's one generic riff over and over. then again, it was just meant to accompany a movie, so it's understandable. Burning Bridges is Meddle-esque, mellow and soothing. Waters and Gilmore exchange vox and it turns out to be one of the better tracks. The Gold It's In the... is a straightforward rock song with a ripping Gilmore solo. Mudmen turns out to be my favorite track on the whole cd. Mason uses a simple, driving beat to propell an introspective, melancholy tune that's great for reflection. Childhood's end is one of the Floyd's best songs ever, a testament to Gilmore's abilities. This album is essential for the hardcore PF fan. It's pretty relaxing.
0884271153|5.0|I've read this book several times.  It does a wonderful job teaching when to apply the various TOC tools and a little on how. Depending on what you are doing, I recommend combining It's Not Luck with Thinking for a Change by Scheinkopf and/or Throughput Accounting.  Most people need both the 10,000' view from The Goal, The Race and It's Not Luck and the details provided by the APICS series and some of the North River Press books.  Take care when purchasing detailed books, since the quality varies greatly.
B00003CXB4|4.0|As much as i like The Lion King, the DVD somewhat dissapointed me. Not only looks the (cheap) 3D-Zazu extremely out of place, but the whole menu is much too long. So after skipping tons of Disney trailers at every start, about 5 minutes have passed until you can finally watch the main event.<br />Nevertheless, the movie is a classic!<br />Also worth to mention are the sites lionking.com (official) and Planet Lion King ([...]) which features many screenshots and much much more!

B0000DD7LB|4.0|Took me awhile to get used to MOST of these songs, but now I am, &amp; it's actually pretty good.<br /> Me Against the Music- 3.5/5 Madonna sucks, but the song is pretty catchy, heard way too much<BR> <BR> (I Got that) Boom Boom- 1/5 Can I just say... boring<br /> Showdown- 4/5 Whauh.. that's just funny, I love this song, especially the beat for the chorus &amp; the verses are just hot<br /> Breathe On Me- 5/5 Way too hot, &amp; so good<br /> Early Morning- 4.5/5 Great song, just amazing<br /> Toxic- 4/5 Despite this being the new single, &amp; being played constantly, it's quite catchy<br /> Outragous- 4/5 It's pretty good, mostly dance/techno, like the rest of the album<br /> Touch of My Hand- 5/5 Her 1st serious song on the album, sad &amp; very catchy. Slower then most but just the same, excellent<br /> The Hook Up- 3.5/5 Somewhat catchy, it's alright<br /> Shadow- 5/5 One of the only songs that I really liked right from the start, it's a sad &amp; well-done song<br /> Brave New Girl- 5/5 &amp; she's coming out tonight, the 2nd of the 3 songs that I liked from the start, the verses are pretty good, the pre-chorus kinda sucks but the chorus is awesome, I just love it. Upbeat &amp; great.<br /> Everytime- 5/5 Beautiful song, don't know how she did it, it's so sad, but just so beautiful at the same time, the best on the album, without any doubt<br /> Me Against the Music(Remix)- 4/5 It's an alright remix, I guess, it's actually kinda fun &amp; more upbeat then the original song, &amp; I haven't heard 6, 000 times, so it gets a better mark<br /> Overall, it's a pretty good album &amp; I recommend anyone to get it. Not poppy at all, after this, I would consider her more dance/techno, only way better then Moby.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|X2 is a fine example of what a great sequel should be. A movie that takes the best of the original, and not only improves it but adds another dynamic of greatness with to it Huge Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and  Ian Mckelen are all great in this movie as they were in the last, and Brain Cox brings a great menace to the table as a government agent determine to kill every mutant on the face of the earth. Follow ups don't get better than this, and I rank it right up there with Empire Strikes Back as one of the best sequels ever made.
B00009V7RF|2.0|I normally don't buy many CDs, but I ran out to buy The Black Eyed Peas Elephunk after watching the Video for Hey Mama.  I LOVE the video version of the song!  It's full of energy and fun to listen to.  The version on Elephunk is   s l o w   and dreary.      I bought the album without reading Amazon reviews (big mistake).  I gave the CD two stars only because of the tracks 5, 9, and 13 (even though it's different from video and radio).  Elephunk is an interesting CD to listen to, but not what I wanted.  It's pathetic when they have to resort to false advertising to sell CDs.      I confess I really am a huge fan of the female member- Fergie.  I hope she makes a solo album.  She certainly has the talent to be on her own.     Aside from the travesty that is the album version of Hot Moma, there are good songs on Elephunk.  I especially love track 9, Fly Away.   There's no doubt the BEP are extremely talented- but not when it comes to writing lyrics.      I'll just continue to download music since it's apparent the songs they advertise on videos and radio are not even available to buy!     Now to download the good version of Hot Moma...
0446608955|1.0|I read this for a book group, and we generally agreed that it was terrible. Not Sparks' best work, emotionally manipulative, and not even very well written. The foreshadowing was as subtle as a brick on a 3-layer chocolate cake. On a more personal note, I myself could do with a lot less god in a novel, and a whole lot less deus ex machina. If you're the kind of person who gleefully embraces the kind of emotional manipulation that characterizes both Hallmark TV Movies and Hallmark commercials, then this is right for you. Otherwise, it's a good one to skip entirely. I give it 1 star because you can read it in less than 3 hours if you're a fast reader, so at least the agony is over soon.
B0001AP12G|5.0|This cd is the best i have heard in a long time. its good to hear hip-hop that isnt about cars, jewels, and money kanye you  did it again. Every beat is tight and every track is hot.
B00005JLT5|5.0|There are so many ways to review a film.  So many angles, perspectives.  Criticisms are as easy to find (Brody's long hair toward the end is not that convincing) as laurels (Polanski's brilliant use of original black and white footage (much viewable on the U.S. Holocaust Memorial website) of pre-war Warsaw integrated into the scenes of film--reconstructions, if you will.<br />In all respects a brilliant film.<br />I will therefore focus on only one aspect.  This is the encounter between Szpilman, the Pianist, and Wehrmacht Hauptmann des Reserves Wilm Hosenfeld (pulled from the Reserves out of wartime necessity), the man who provided the means for him to survive the few weeks left before the Red Army enters Warsaw, which, using Computer Graphic Imaging, is in color as startlingly real as the actual black and white photographs of the period--near total destruction and decimation of a great city.<br />That encounter, which of course one must live through the film to appreciate, is acted to perfection by Brody and Thomas Kretschmer, the German actor.  I have before me an actual photograph of Captain Hosenfeld in 1940, having what appears to be a pleasant conversation with a Jew, on the street, in the snow, in Wegrow.<br />Hosenfeld was an unusual man, leaving behind many letters to home.  He died in ingnominity in some Soviet prison camp--only 5,000 of some 90,000 Prisoners of War returned to Germany--a Holocaust unto itself about which we know little.<br />Hosenfeld was a Captain of Reserves, if anything, a rather stunning man in contrast to what we normally think of when we see the Wehrmacht officer in uniform, the Reichsadler (Reich Eagle holding the Swastika, or Hackenkreuz in German), prominently over the right upper breast pocket of the Waffenrock (four pocket tunic).<br />Even in the winter of 1939/1940 (the photo is in a recent German book, \\"Retter in Uniform\\"--Rescuers in Uniform--showing Hosenfeld and Schindler to be hardly unique.  Schindler a war profiteer who seemingly regains, or assumes, his humanity in Schindler's list....Hosenfeld, a busy leader organizing retreat who can take the time to listen to Szpilman play, and to say ironically, with a smile--good name for a Pianist.  In German, it would be Spielman--one who plays.  These contrasts--the emaciated Szpilman, the robust, dutiful if resigned Hosenfeld, make the film unforgettable--you will not have to worry about placing it in a \\"favorite's\\" place.  You can never forget the moment when Kretschmer, as Hosenfeld, says. \\"Speil was\\"--play something.<br />This film lasted, possibly, four weeks in Austin, Texas, at one, two, maybe three theaters, often nearly empty.  I recommend it most highly, for its tragic and ecstatic moments, one of the most dramatic being Szpilman's ultimately failed search for Hosenfeld.  Mr. Polanski has not lost his filmmaking touch.ho seemingly regains, or assumes, his humanity in Schindler's list....Hosenfeld, a busy leader organizing retreat who can take the time to listen to Szpilman play, and to say ironically, with a smile--good name for a Pianist.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|In response to what jahandar jahanbeglou from weissernhorn Germany wrote (&quot;who would pay 2 million $ for a relatively unknown so called star to just make a wisky advert ??&quot;):<BR>First of all, the character Bob played by Bill Murry is NOT an unknown actor - Bob is a very well known, famous and reputable actor. How could you not pick that up while watching the film? Second, MANY A-list Hollywood actors and celebrities go to Japan for short trips to film multi-million dollar commercials, which most people in America will never see nor know about, which is exactly what the actors intend. <BR>The character Bob was very realistic and plausible. I think you just didn't quite understand the depiction of the characters, which makes sense considering you are a German watching a film about Americans in Japan.
B00005JMJ4|2.0|Although I can see the appeal of this film, and understand why some people like it, I was certainly not one of those people.  Like others, I found this movie to be very slow, melancholy (which was the intent I'm sure), choppy and sad.  There is nothing uplifting about it.  There is no message, no lesson, no epiphany of any kind.  However, that is the intention and done quite purposefully.  Bill Murray is the picture of restraint.  His performance is stiff, truthful and bleak.  If this movie had a sound, it would be monotone.<br />Do not expect to see Bill Murray as his comedic self, and do not expect a laugh a minute.  This is a sad, soul searching film, with superficial humor sprinkled in to lighten the heavy theme.  The two main characters can be summed up as boredom meets boredom.  There is nothing deep here.<br />I also think the Japanese are portrayed in quite an unflattering light.  They are depicted as sterotypical, clueless characters who cannot pronounce any English whatsoever (\\"L\\" and \\"R\\") words.  This theme of, \\"How come they talk so funny?\\" is quite arrogant.  Not very PC for 2004.  The American characters ARE the foreigners, but act as if they shouldn't be.  Was this intentional?<br />Realistic and touching at times, with beautiful scenery, this movie is best seen with the viewer knowing what to expect - understated sadness, bored characters questioning their life choices, and nothing much more than that.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Well, after hearing the hype about this movie I was really excited to get a chance to watch it.  Two hours later, I feel as if someone owes me my money back!  The movie is slow moving, and really has no point.  It is just a movie about two sad people stuck half way around the world from home, hanging out for a week, and that's i t .   No plot twists, no climax, nothing just ...   u g h !
B00005JMJ4|2.0|The movie had a  few funny  parts but it  just didn't go anywere and a depressing feeling.
B000000W5N|5.0|Of course, there are endless debates about which Stones album is the best, but for Sticky Fingers I can say this: There isn't a weak track, it has some of the best songs in their catalogue (hits or otherwise), AND it is the most varied album musically.  You've got straight rock and roll, blues, acoustic ballads, country, strings, and even a song that totally jams out (Can't You Hear Me Knocking).  The famous hits are Brown Sugar and Wild Horses, but in my opinion, this CD has the meatiest offering of the Stones songs that aren't &quot;hits&quot; and never made the best of discs: Sway, with its incredible solo, Can't You Hear Me Knocking, with its awesome riff and innovative structure, Sister Morphine with its eerie, drugged out jams, and Moonlight Mile, an incredible closer.  Beggars Banquet was a lot of blues and acoustic rock, Let it Bleed only hits its stride halfway, but this is a fantastic and varied listen all the way through.  If you want the album that shows you the Stones in every way, shape and form with great songs beyond just the &quot;hits,&quot; this is the album to get.  I consider it one of the greatest rock and roll albums ever, and cut for cut, one of the greatest straight through listens.  Buy this now, or try to get your hands on the 1994 special remastered edition with the real zipper and extra packaging.
B000062XE1|5.0|This collection offers four performances and a bonus biography of Wilde. That is a good thing. Unfortunately quantity does not always equal quality.\\"The Picture of Dorian Gray\\", in my opinion (aside from Gielgud's stunning Harry Wotton) did not do a great justice to the book. The \\"Importance of Being Earnest\\" is better when Dame Edith Evans plays the monster who is, unfairly, not a myth. Joan Plowright is an incredibly stunning actress, but she is not a Lady Bracknell. Oh my, no! (To be fair, neither is Judi Dench). \\"An Ideal Husband\\" will never again be the same after Cate Blanchett, Minnie Driver, and Rupert Everett. They have all the playfulness, youth, and fun, of Oscar Wilde. This rendition is too dated. That leaves \\"Lady Windermere's Fan\\". Astounding!! Helena Little is superb in this character. She has that shy, gentile, sweetness that is essential for the role. Sara Kestelman will have you on the floor laughing. She is over the top!! She actually changes a line in the play. The Duchess of Berwick is supposed to say \\"Agatha darling, will you go out on the terrace and look at the sunset?\\". Instead she asks poor, sweet, dear, darling Agatha to look \\"for\\" a sunset...the effect is hilarious and it is all Kestelman's own brilliant work. Her performance alone rates her right up there! Right beside Dame Edith Packer in my opinion. Aside from Maggie Smith, I have never seen an actress who can play the part of an \\"English\\" Lady quite like Kestelman. It is worth the price of the DVD alone.     That leaves the biography. A tour de force!! Alan Sinfield, Isobel Murray, Merlin Holland, and Bosie's great-grandniece (Lady Alice Douglas) all appear in this wonderful docu-drama. The music begins with a mellow cello that is very touching. There is the recording of Wilde (pseudo?) quoting from the Ballad of Reading Gaol. The documentary ends with the late Sir John Gielgud reading the last lines of \\"De Profundis\\" at the dedication ceremony of the Oscar Wilde memorial window in Westminster Abbey. That will make you shiver. If you're a Wilde fan, the biography will make you laugh, cry, feel proud, shamed, in short, the whole range of human emotions. Too bad it's so short. Postmodernists might think it too mushy to say, but if you put your heart where your intellect is and unite them, then you will see that this biography captures a life with love. The love that Oscar gave, and the love we have for him!     I recommend this collection on the whole.
B00005QG9J|5.0|This is the definitive incubus album. Many people may say that make yourself or science is, but you have to look at the quality of the music. The music on Morning view is tremendous; its so effortless and yet so complex and clever. Brandon's lyrics, are of course, second to none, he is a modern day lyrical messiah. The bass lines are warm, they guitar playing ranges from heavy to mellow and the drumming is top notch. The one thing about this record that really makes it shine, however, is the way it manages to relay a positive vibe throughout, which is very rarely found in modern rock music. Its a really uplifting set of songs. 'Wish you were here', especially achieves this, along with others such as 'Are you in?' and 'Echo'. I tend to see this album as just a long sonic experience, which is so varied. 'Aqueous Transmission' is one of the best concepts in years, finishing the album in true style. As Brandon Boyd once said, &quot;the aim of the song is to make the listener pee his/her pants&quot;. If this song doesnt have that affect, the album will. Like i said in my title, in my opinion this is one of the greatest albums of all time. Just buy it - NOW!
B0001AP12G|5.0|This cd is unbelievable..........it's not all about the whips and ice although kanye does mention it...but even when he mentions it it's funny and the CONTENT on this cd is amazing....Kanye is starting to pick up where Jay left off...
B000006NPY|5.0|This Cd is much more sad than previous, although I am told it was done after Billy's mom died and I would definitly be sad. But just to warn others who like the pumpkins and are leary of buying this one, dont get me wrong but the songs are not as upbeat as is their usual. Still a great Cd.
B00004Z459|3.0|My recent listening includes Pink Floyd, Outkast, Garbage, Michelle Branch, Live, A.F.I., Meat Puppets, Monster Magnet, and Pearl Jam. I listen to just about everything, and I own upwards of 250 cds. So don't think that I'm just some MTV Android. This was the first cd I ever got and does not deserve all of the critical acclaim or all of the hatred bashing it receives. However, this is THE cd that made it cool to mix rap and rock. Lyrically dismal yet musically refreshing and entertaining, you can't really go wrong with this better-than-average cd.
B000066NW0|1.0|Once I heard what some &quot;critics&quot; consider good music, I felt ashamed of the music industry.  The image she presents in contrast to her music don't fit.  She looks like she is going through a childhood phase and her music sounds like it is too.  Originality in mainstream music has died and I'm severely disappointed when I hear of someone that proclaims that they are original like Avril Lavigne.  It's ridiculously typical and just by a change of instruments, it can be borderline country music but not just any country music, typical country music.  This is not music.  This is no better than bubble gum teen pop.  In fact, it has sunk to a deeper level.  This is selling out people and there is no complexity to the music and to the riffs or scales I've heard.  I've heard all this crap before.  Obviously she can sing.  But she is way too easily amused if this is what she &quot;honestly&quot; believes is music.
B00000IP3S|4.0|Blind Guardian prove themselves excellent musicians in IFTOS. but there is some 'soul' to it that seems to be missing. Its like the cd fails to fully grasp that emotional essence that Night of the Opera or Nightfall in Middle Earth radiates. every song is detailed (my personal favorite is track 7 Bright Eyes), lined with great guitar work, ausome keyboarding, and absolutly amazing vocals, but still this cd fails to reach the high level of appreciation i have for NIME. either way i recomend buying this, because it is worth checking out and owning. But if you are new to Blind Guardian I highly recomend checking out NIME!<BR>Blind Guardian forever!!!!!!! \m/
0440237688|5.0|Jonas, a twelve-year-old boy lives in a community where everything is pretty much kept the same.  However, once he turns twelve, along with everyone else in his age group receives a job assignment that fits their personality.  He is given one of the most important and respected jobs of all-the Receiver.  As the Receiver, he learns what life was like before the sameness and learns to love that more than the life he knows.  <br />I have read this book for the second time and I have thoroughly enjoyed it both times.  It really makes a person appreciate the little differences in everyone and hope that even if peace can be achieved through sameness, we still should love one another for who we are and not for who we aren't.  We should appreciate differences and learn to be much more open-minded.
B0000CFW87|4.0|I first heard Josh Groban on Ally McBeal, and I fell in love!  I couldn't wait to get his CD and hear more.  I am so glad that I got &quot;Closer&quot; and I just want to listen to it over and over.  The song &quot;You Raise Me Up&quot; is one of the best songs I have ever heard, and to hear him sing it gives me chills!  You will not regret buying this album!!
B000002UAU|5.0|Absolutley sensational, there are just not enough superlatives to describe how good this album is. In the sixties, there were the BEATLES, and then there was everybody else. Nobody can come close to this masterpeice, many tried, for example the Rolling Stones laughable &quot;Satanic Majesties Request&quot;. But the only album from around that time that comes anywhere near this one is &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; by the Beach Boys which actually came out a year or so earlier, and the &quot;Piper at the gates of Dawn&quot; by Pink Floyd which came out a little while later.<BR>And to think the Beatles did all this with 1967 technology, and just think of what they could have done if they made this album today.
B0000028MA|5.0|The Grundge era of the early 90s was a wonderful time for me, growing up as a teen.  The music, album and movie were great.  I still love the grunge music from that time period.  It's better than what happened musically the rest of the decade and into the new millenium.
B00005QGAZ|5.0|During the enormous success of ''Off The Wall'', Michael Jackson began working on ''Triumph'' with his brothers. In between ''Off The Wall'' and ''Thriller'', the ''Gloved'' one was quite busy, leading his voice/writing talents to various artists-Minnie Riperton, his sister LaToya Jackson, Diana Ross etc. Indeed Jackson was occupied with musical projects during 1980-1982 and on top of that recording a solo album must have taken a toll on the superstar.<br />''Thriller'' was originally entitled ''Starlight'', however that title was quickly replaced with the original title. Whatever one may think of Michael Jackson's personal issues, you simply can't dismiss his music abilities. He is perhaps one of the best male artists to ever grace this earth. ''Thriller'' sold a staggering 51 million copies and it still remains the biggest selling album of all time. Not mentioning it earned the pop wizard 8 Grammies in 1983.<br />''Wanna Be Starting Something'' kicks off the album with its percussion-driven rhythm. The offering is an underrated gem and among my faves on the ''Thriller'' album. Its anger at gossip and feeling of betrayal seemed relevant in the years to come. He even offers moral advice ''If You Can't Feed Your Baby, Then Don't Have A Baby, And Don't Think Maybe, If You Can't Feed Your Baby'' to those getting pregnant who can't comprehend the consequences of raising a child. Another highlight, written by Jackson as well, includes Beat It. The ''non-violence'' anthem had a positive message attached to it. The guitar solo, performed by Eddie Van Halan, is superb giving the song an overall rockier sound. It's still considered an favourite of mine and the video supports the song quite well. Having written a total of 4 songs for the ''Thriller'' album, Jackson contributed with his perhaps most popular song ever ''Billie Jean''. One simply can't state how brilliantly this song is. The tale of a woman as the predator had everyone doing the famous Moonwalk. Even to this dayit still gets played at clubs and parties. The Jackson/McCartney duet ''The Girl Is Mine'' is a sugary ballad and the weakest offering on the album. Quite ironic as it was the lead single from the album.<br />Rod Temperton contributed with 3 songs ''Baby Be Mine'' ,''The Lady In My Life'' and ''Thriller''. The former is a nice mid-tempo tale of a love song. The bubbling chorus is catchy and lures you into the song. ''Lady In My Life'' is one of Michael Jackson best vocal performance, especially the begging toward the end of the song is simply amazing. Easily one of Jackson's best love song. ''Thriller'' is perhaps best-known for that ''scary'' video that accompany the song. It has been voted as the best music video of all time in numerous polls around the world and rightfully so. <br />The underrated gem ''Human Nature'' shows a tender side to Jackson. The sensual mid-tempo is among Jackson's best ever. However it doesn't get the respect it truly deserves. SWV used a sample of ''Human Nature'' and turned it into a smash of a song. Giving the original one some of the attention that it's truly deserving of. ''PYT'' is the most ''popish'' song on the album, its cute and catchy sound makes you listen to it a couple of times. Along with ''The Girl Is Mine'', these two are the weakest offerings on ''Thriller''. They are still enjoyable however.<br />The Special Edition of ''Thriller'' offers you several treats. The unreleased ''Carousel'' is a nice ballad, however upon hearing this version, it is evident why it didn't make the final tracklisting, ''Carousel'' wasn't strong enough and its sound doesn't suit the ''Thriller'' album at all. Someone In The Dark was originally used for the E.T storybook and it is nice ballad as well. The Demo version of ''Billie Jean'' allows fans to get a closer glimpse of Jackson's work habits. Vincent Price's original rap on the song ''Thriller'' is included as well giving the listener a chance to hear the entire section. Included as well are interviews with the producer Quincy Jones and Rod Temperton.<br />''Thriller'' put Michael Jackson on the map internationally. He suddenly gained lesions of new fans across the world. The ''Thriller'' album is a classic in every sense of the word and I would highly recommend the disc to anyone who enjoys great pop music. I would have given the album 5 stars hadn't it been for dull ''The Girl Is Mine''. ''Thriller'' is a great record to start your Michael Jackson collection with.<br />Overall Rate: 9.8/10
B00005NTJK|5.0|The early Tull albums are more bluesy and hard rocking than their later albums from the late 1970's till today.<br />This also goes for \\"Benefit\\" their 1971 album. Many of the tunes are based on guitar riffs such as \\"To Sing You a Song\\", \\"Teacher\\" and \\"Play in Time\\" .<br />This is one their most consistent albums, with no filler/weak tracks, though some of the songs may sound a bit dated to young listeners. Most of the tunes are both melodic and rocking, a few quiet songs there too; among them 3 of the bonus tracks \\"Just Trying to Be\\", \\"Singing All Day\\" and \\"Witch's Promise\\" which were originally released on the compilation album  \\"Living in the Past\\". The last bonus track \\"Teacher\\" comes from the American version of the original Benefit album.<br />Jethro Tull was always Ian Anderson's project with many changes in the line-ups; but he always chose brilliant musicians, and allowed them to show their skills. On this album especially  exquisite guitarist and long-time member Martin Barre.<br />My favourites: \\"Son\\", \\"For Michael Collins\\", \\"To Cry You a Song\\" and \\"Sossity, You're a Woman\\"
B00006CXXU|4.0|1999's saw the first release by the solo artist Christina Aguilera. Hearing ''Genie In A Bottle'' on various radio formats left little to desire. A nice mid-tempo with a modern R&amp;B twist caught my attention. ''What A Girl Wants'' had all the right ingredients-the bouncy beat, the perky lyrics etc., yet her debut album contained mostly bubble-gum and dull pop songs. The only thing that left me impressed was her striking voice, when she was using it right.One of the main problem, besides the material, with her first album release was her use of vocals, Ms. Aguilera had a tendency to ''scream'' the vocals. Seemingly ''Stripped'' has put an end to the use of some-called vocal gymnastics. It is evident that Aguilera has learnt to control her voice a whole lot better on ''Stripped''. She is certainly using it better, ranging from singing in a gritty voice to the vulnerability singing in ''I'm OK''.<br />2002 saw Christina Aguilera releasing her sophomore album ''Stripped''. A slow seller at first, however things started to heat up when ''Beautiful'' hit the airwaves. At the present time ''Stripped'' has become a  million seller and it's still having impact on various chart in the UK, Germany and the US.<BR>The album contains 4 interludes and a staggering 16 songs. Mind you 16 full-length songs . Quite impressive even by today standard. I would have prefer several songs entirely excluded from the disc, they could have been included on future single releases as b-sides.<br />The highlights: Can't Hold Us Down is an empowering anthem for the females featuring the  ''ranchy'' rapper Lil Kim, which has become a huge hit among clubbers and the MTV generation. The funky club joint is a lash toward men, who don't show respect towards the females. The ''Janet Jackson-esque'' Fighter with its rock-driven guitar licks, provided by Dave Navarro, was an instant smash with listeners. ''Keep On Singing My Song'' is my favourite unreleased song. A challenge to ''Beautiful'' and a better one at that. The former is a gospel inspired song, carrying the overall the message that Ms. Aguilera will  continue to do what she pleases. ''Loving Me 4 Me'' throws some neo-soul your way with a sense of jazzy vocals. As the title suggests it shall be taken literally. The jazzy ''Underappreciated'' with its chanting 'Underappreciated' lyrics work extremely well, especially the chorus. The Alicia Keys-penned ''Impossible'' displays the 70's R&amp;B sound, which works perfect for Christiana Aguliera's voice.<br />The Down-Falls: The lead single ''Dirrty'' doesn't represent the sound of the album at all, which is a good thing if you ask me. This is one track I can easily do without. In fact you won't find everything similar to it on ''Stripped''. Get Mine, Get Yours isn't a favourite of mine either. Never mind the lyrics, the music is mediocre at best. ''Make Over'' sounds like Sugababes' ''Overloaded'' lovechild.<BR>Overall I would have the prefer a more subtlry sound for the album. Hopefully Christina will make a jazz album in the future as several of the songs on ''Stripped'' display her voice would be suitable for such an album. <br />Simply put ''Stripped'' is among the most cohesive release of 2002. The album contains all the ingredients- a little something for the pop-lovers, the rocky Fighter, the soulful Keep On Singing My Song, 70's R&amp;B etc. Christina Aguilera displays a rare talent, she even co-wrote and co-arranged over half of the songs on ''Stripped''.<br />If you like pop with some substance this album will suit you perfectly. Even the R&amp;B heads might like it as well. <br />Overall rating: 8/10
B000000W5L|2.0|This album is overrated.  The previous statement does not preclude me from being a Rolling Stones fan, but my affinity for &quot;Satanic Majesties&quot; may do just that.  My attempts to enjoy &quot;Exile&quot; have not been passive.  A friend communicated some ancient lore that if one sat down and REALLY listened to it, the mysteries of the Stones' magnum opus would be revealed.  Unfortunately, I never moved past the state of &quot;meh.&quot;  I gave it the requisite pair of spins, and tried again, again, and again.  I could probably cite the number of times I've listened to &quot;Exile&quot; since each time was so tedious.<br />Not that the album is really that bad.  It has some first rate songs, but the sheer crappiness of &quot;Rip This Joint&quot; almost drags the entire album down.  Having a mediocre second song does not do wonders for an album's flow.  &quot;Shake Your Hips&quot; is great, but &quot;Sweet Virginia&quot; sounds phoned it.  This album really has none of the passion and fire that made &quot;Let It Bleed&quot; wonderful, and none of the simmering angst that elated &quot;Aftermath.&quot;<br />I write this as a cautionary warning to the consumer out there.  Buy every other Stones album first, and if you still need a fix, come here.
B000059MEK|5.0|Daft punk's discovery is a master piece <BR>The good about daft punk is they allways try to sound <BR>diffrent and they have their own  way of doing things.<BR>NOBODY in the world sounds like Daft punk cause <BR>There will allways be only one daft<BR>and thats the way it is folks<br />My favorite track on discovery is VOYAGER<BR>how about using that tune in the startrek series of the same name.That could be funk....

0385504209|1.0|I purchased this book because a few of my friends told me that it's &quot;The best book ever&quot; and other such comments.  I should have read these reviews first...  Apparently, those who do not know what it means to be a great book tend to over-rate anything they actually read.  As the other reviews have said, you will finish this book quickly because it is very fast paced.  And it does have some interesting parts.  But, in general, the story is completely ridiculous, which makes it very unsatisfying.  I also find it to be shallow.  If you read books for cheap entertainment value, read this one.
0393039765|5.0|If you tire of the same Stephen King predictable novels and Tom Clancy shoot 'em ups, then pick up &quot;Fight Club.&quot;That is exactly what I did on the advice of a friend and have since finished &quot;Survivor&quot; and started &quot;Choke&quot;.<br />&quot;Fight Club&quot; is by far the best book I have ever read in my 17 years of life.You will be entranced by the odd and sometimes disturbing activities of our narartor and Tyler Durden.As the novel opens, we are brought into the life of a mysterious and sleep deprived young man, searching for something to fill a hole in his life that his dead-end job can't.<BR>Enter Tyler Durden, who will take the narator and us on an endless ride into the darkest reachs and most basic urges of the human mind;touching base with the simple fact that sometimes, we all need to beat the living crap out of someone else.<BR>As the story moves along, Tyler opens more and more fight clubs as the craze hits the underground US.The book takes an ending so surprising you may have to read the book twice!!!<br />So if you want to read a simply amazing book, GO GET &quot;FIGHT CLUB!!!&quot;
B000006O7C|5.0|It is a tragic shame this album was not completed. This shows Buckley's willingness to evolve into a true artist. He finished 'Grace' with class, it was time to move on. Some of the songs on this album would fit perfectly on Radiohead's recent releases, while others could be attached to an almost endless list of random artists. The first disc is a group of studio cuts destined, most likely to never see the light of day(not these versions at least).The second disc is comprised, mostly of home recordings(after Buckley was dissatisfied with direction).This record may just be &quot;sketches&quot;, but one day it will get the attention it deserves.
B000002TQV|5.0|High and Dry, Fake Plastic Trees and The Bends.  A song about love lost, another song about the hopelessness of the modern condition, and third that is just a fricking rocker.  Radiohed shows a nice sample of everything its capable of on this album.  With traditional rock arrangements lacking any electonica (The Bends and Bones) as well as some experimentation.  That first chord on the Bends just rips a hole in the speaker when you play it loud.  I love this album, and it was really my entree into this gem of a band.  Radiohead gives and gives the more you listen.  Skeptics (I know you are still out there, despite the love-fest that music critics have ejoyed with this band for the last 8 years):  don't lose heart, it is worth the wait.  When it hits you, you'll be downright thankful.
0385486804|5.0|This is a very haunting book. Krakauer does an excellent job writing it. It we all got back to being humans, to living as we formally did, tragedies like this would not occur. Civilization is killing us all. McCandless was fulfilling who he was. It is too bad he didn't make it
B00005ONMO|5.0|I'm afraid I can only discuss Sinopoli's recording of the 8th.  It is the only one from this cycle I own.<br />However, it is fabulous.  Yes, I've heard (and own) the Solti, the first Bernstein, the Haitink, the Abbado, and others.<br />This is the best.  On every single level.  Superior sonics.  Superior soloists (especially the vastly underrated soprano Angela Maria Blasi and the absolutely fearless tenor Keith Lewis).<br />The fabled Philharmonia Orchestra and Chorus cover themselves with glory, as usual.<br />Are the other recordings in this set on equal par?  I have no idea.  As with any project as enormous as this, there are sure to be highs and lows.<br />However, this 8th is so head-and-shoulders above the rest I'm very tempted to plunk down the big bucks and find out.
0684833395|4.0|In the beginning, we are introduced to the protagonist, Yossarian, and the situation based in the last part of WWII.  It is difficult to keep from chuckling out loud while reading about the many desperate attempts of the squadron to escape the gruesome and violent conditions of the war.  Somehow, Joseph Heller incorporates a light-hearted, humorous tone into a melancholy situation.  By claiming to be sick and insane, the men buy time away from the dangerous flights, but the captain just keeps sending them on more required missions before they can be sent home.  This actually holds the pilots in the captivity of the war until they complete the continuous assignments.  With these discouraging conditions, Yossarian endures many difficult experiences, including the death of his friend.  The ending is technically a happy ending but the reader is left with a feeling of despondence.  Though I began the book expecting it to be more of a male's favorite, I was surprised at my enjoyment of this action-packed, humorous novel.  This book deserves a four because it is hard to put down, but not my favorite.
B000068IEU|1.0|I was watching something on tv one night &amp; they were talking about this movie saying it was the best scary movie ever. What a JOKE that turned out to be! This movie sucked! The special effects were terrible,&amp; the acting was at best,awful! You shouldn't even waste your money spending 2 bucks to rent it!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|It's so sad that this is the end of the Trilogy. I sincerely enjoyed listening to the music of the 3 parts of the Lord of the Rings. Howard Shore spared no effort to make us feel the events of the story. His vision and enthusiasm were a great help to the making of this movie.<br />- As usual, Shore brings some of the old music from the Fellowship of the Ring esp. in his first theme (A storm is coming).  This time he lets us feel the moments when Smeagol was a hobbit enjoying his time in fishing with his friend Deagol, who found the One Ring, but was murdered by Smeagol.  However, there're parts of the theme in the movie, but were not incorporated in the soundtrack CD.<BR>- (Hope and memory) reminds us with the scene when Gandalf were heading toward Minas Tirith with Pippin. Then comes (Minas Tirith) into play when they reached the City of Men.  This theme combines also the escape of Faramir from the orcs &amp; Nazgul who took over the bridge, the West Bank, and Osgiliath.<BR>- (The White Tree) is a combination of many themes such as the time when the Steward of Gondor was weeping for his dead son (Boromir), and also when the sign of help traveled from Gondor to Rohan.<BR>- (The Steward of Gondor) is a good theme which makes us feel the moment when Faramir with his soldiers were going back to fight the orcs in Osgiliath.  This theme stars Billy Boyd (Pippin) when he sings a sad song for the Steward who enjoys his meal while his soldiers are fighting &amp; being killed !<BR>- (Minas Morgul) is a theme full of darkness &amp; evil esp when Frodo, Sam &amp; Gollum were in Minas Morgul.<BR>- (The Riders of Rohirrim) is self-descriptive, and a beautiful theme which shows courage of the Rohan soldiers.<BR>- (Twilight and Shadow) is one of the most brilliant themes, performed by Rene Fleming. It's touching and so sad.  When u listen to it, u will picture the sad Arwen Undomiel leaving to the Grey Haven according to her father's will.  But later she changes her plan and goesback to Rivendell to convince her father to reforge the sword of Elendil (the King's sword) for Aragorn, her beloved man.<BR>- (Cirith Ungol) is good music; part of it includes the moment when Frodo abandons Sam to continue the journey with him.<BR>- (Anduril) is great one, since it lets u picture the reforging of the sword of Elendil (Anduril) by the elves.<BR>- (Shelob's lair) is evil theme and lets u feel the fearful moments that Frodo had to go thru when he was escaping from that creepy creature. However, the theme misses the part where Lady Galadriel came into play after Frodo fell down.<BR>- (Ash &amp; smoke) describes the war against Gondor.<BR>- (The field of Pelennor) is a great theme which describes the coming of the Rohirrim and their courage leaded by King Theoden against orcs.<BR>- (Hope fails) music theme is good.<BR>- (The black gate opens) forms the main theme of all the battles.  Shore brings us to the scene where the black gate opens then back to Frodo &amp; Sam remembering the Shire and how brave Sam is when he says the best words of friendship (I can't carry it for you, but I can carry you !).<br />The last 3 themes are the best of all the themes in addition to (Twilight &amp; shadow):<BR>- (The end of all things) is beautiful. It starts when Frodo claimed the ring to be his, then fights with Gollum for it until Gollum cuts Frodo's finger and takes the ring (performed by Rene Fleming), then Frodo fights again with him until he falls down in the lava of the volcano.  As a consequence to the casting of the One Ring, Sauron's tower falls and Sauron dies &amp; all the evil which used to charge the orcs force diminished.  Frodo &amp; Sam is now left on a large rock, then Gandalf rescues them by his eagles friends. However, there're parts of the music theme in the movie which were not included in the soundtrack, esp. the background when Frodo says (It's gone, it's done).<BR>- (The return of the King) is a standout (and the longest) theme, when Aragornbecame King of Gondor, and Arwen comes at last to be his Queen, but of course after she lost her immortality.<BR>- (The Grey Haven) is so soft and touching, which is the last theme of the movie. It's so sad since the fellowship of the ring is broken after Gandalf &amp; Frodo leave forever to the Grey Haven. It actually makes you cry along with Pippin, Merry, and Sam!<br />- (Into the West) is a lovely song with good lyrics performed by Annie Lennox. You will listen to it many many times.<br />I just wish there could be an Extended Soundtrack of the movie, since some themes were not included in the original soundtrack.<br />In my opinion, this is the best of all the 3 soundtracks of the Lord of the Rings. It's state-of-the-art, brilliant &amp; full of emotions.  It should be classic soundtrack.
B00000099Y|5.0|This album still averages at four and a half stars.  This is one of the greatest, most well-written and performed rock albums of all time.  Everything having to do with this album has already been gone over many times by other reviewers, so I will use my words to attack the seemingly never-ending moronic one star reviews.  Notice that almost NONE of these reviewers have anything intelligent or helpful to say.  To those that do, I respect your opinion, but have to disagree.  I've noticed that many of these negative reviews say something along the lines of: &quot;this isn't real metal.&quot;  Well, first of all, this is PROGRESSIVE ROCK, prog being one of the first forms of metal.  SO GET YOUR HEAD OUT OF YOUR A$$, and know what your saying before it comes spewing out of your mouth.  If this isn't true metal to you, then go drink some Michelob at your trailer and swing your mullet to some Cannibal Corpse, or some other form of musical-diarreah.  Please, if you are going to give this album, or any other a one-star review, at least have an intelligent reason as to why.  And if you choose not to, you can &quot;point your f***ing finger up your a$$.&quot;  See you auntie.
0375713751|2.0|I am in the middle of this book, and while I like the narrator's (Kate's) wry wit, the book does have its problems.  She does only seem to be aware of herself and her world. She makes a lot of money and also has to work hard, I understand, but other women (like my own mother)work just as hard, in careers that are considered \\"boring\\" and don't have the perks (like travel)that her job does. They also have to deal with the same issues she does- a husband who doesn't know how to do things without her, doesn't start dinner, etc. I am glad other women do have these  things, but sometimes this book just seemed like a love story to thoise with glamourous careers and children. Someone should try writing a story about a mom who has to work 3 jobs and deal with her family. This character just needs to get her head out of the sand a bit.
B000002RXS|2.0|Maybe I just don't get it but I fail to see the attraction of this set. As an ardent Callas supporter I just cannot come to terms with this recording. For various reasons; Callas' voice was by 1964 only a shaddow of its former self. There is a very unpleasant beat in her upper notes and in her lower register there is an intrusive wobble. Gedda described it in his autobiography - after having sung her praises - that by the time she recorded Carmen she sang &quot;as if she had a potato in her mouth&quot;. Compare her singing to any of the sets produced in the 1950s and you will notice that by 1964 she had lost control of that instrument that she used to master better than any. &quot;Involvement&quot;, yes, there is involvement but what good is it when the voice is in deplorable condition? As a result she &quot;mouthes&quot; many of her phrases when she should be singing them. Victoria de Los Angeles is also very much involved on the famous Beecham set, her voice is in impeccable condition, her French diction is to my ear faultless and the standard of all the protagonists, including Gedda, and the conducting far superior to what you find on the Callas set. Pretre's conducting is a middle-of-the-road kinda affair (and that road is according to Arnold Schonberg the only road that never leads to Rome), the kind of conducting that you find on many recordings nowadays (Maazel's, Lombard's, Ozawa's) but certainly not with the elan of Thomas Beecham.<br />Ok, Callas' voice was always ugly, but when she mastered it - and she surely did in the 50's - she was captivating, moving, breathtaking to a degree where you had to get involved as a listener. Her singing made you see the action on stage, it was all there in the singing. Carmen she never sang on stage but with her ability there is no question she would have made an excellent job of it when she was in her prime. In 1964 there was very little left. I cannot think of any other recording of any other work where a singer the voice being in such bad condition was still allowed.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|The most terrible, awful, worthless and meaningless movie I have ever seen in 40 years.  I cannot believe that this type of fraud went unnoticed and unpunished in the media.  This was a mockery of the entire film viewing community and the cinematography overall.  What a waste of time!!!  Best  movie ???? Best Director ???????????? .... Are you kidding me?  This film does not even qualify to be called the best trash of the century.  What a joke?  Hollywood is becoming more and more detached from the general audience.  They make movies just to entertain their own refined or sick taste and fantasies.  What a pile of meaningless garbage?  I cannot believe I fell into this trap of good previews by questionably professional and at the same time corrupt movie critics.  A movie packed with spiritual and mental impotents engaged in emotional hemorrhage for the entire duration of the movie.  This is probably the best description of this movie.  Stay as far away from it as possible!!!
B0000CFW87|5.0|I just want good music and &quot;Closer&quot; certainly qualifies. In fact, it passes with flying colors. <br />I respect the fact that Josh is doing the kind of music that he likes, and that people are responding to it. He's not your typical Pop artist, but why should he be??? He didn't conform to the norm. Thank God. I'd rather listen to music that genuinely reflects who the artist is, than something that represents a manufactured identity.<br />I truly appreciate artists like: Josh Groban, Norah Jones, Alicia Keys, Clay Aiken, Eminem, Outkast, and Kanye West. Why? Because they're succeeding based upon their own individuality and merits. They're not trying to be anybody else but themselves. I'm tired of clones and carbon copies. That's why I'm supporting Josh because he's an original.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Doubt I can say anything that the other reviewers haven't already said better...<br />This series tops anything I've ever seen on TV or in the theater. The quality is stunning, the characters complex, the situations interesting. It pushes the edge in every way and hopefully will be remembered for years to come as being a milestone piece of work in Science Fiction production.<br />Fox had a real jewel here - something to top anything on the air right now. Too bad they are so short-shortsighted in thinking audiences just want more mindless sitcoms instead of an engaging show like Firefly. I guess that's why I don't watch TV anymore.<br />A friend loaned this to me. After 2 episodes, I ordered a copy for myself. I cannot seem to rewatch the episodes enough.<br />If you missed it when it originally aired, like I did, do yourself a favor and check it out; you'll be glad you did.
B00009TB5G|4.0|Honestly, with a lot of these things im not quite sure where you people come up with the things you post.  Once again, Peter Jackson has created a masterpiece, and one that is truly worthy of praise, but there is just something about it that just isnt quite as good as the books.  Honestly, there is just one major problem with this one, like with the first one.  The Fellowship cut out Tom Bombadil, who was one of the best characters in the books, and this one threw in a very strange side story with Aragorn, Arwen and Elrond.  While the overall movie was very good, especially extended, the part where Aragorn fell off the cliff was useless and stupid.  They didnt even do anything with it, just had him come back to Helms Deep later.  So, you get the idea.  Like the title says, very good, but it could use improvement.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never got to watch Firefly when it was on Fox because they kept shifting the air time (the same thing they did to Futurama), only picking up the DVD set after reading soooooooo many glowing reviews.  I have to say that I am VERY impressed.  This show was excellent!  Great character development, a setting rife with adventure, great effects, and one hell of a story arch (that was sadly cut down before it even hit its peak).<br />Fox should be ashamed.  This proves to me that network executives are clueless as to what a good show is (just look at the statistics for this last season--something like 1 out of 18 new shows succeeded).<br />Here's to hoping the movie goes into production soon!  If I recall correctly, everyone has signed (happily) to be in a big screen version--but scheduling issues have pushed the release date back to 2005...
B00008O0WN|5.0|Well, i know that now some people are really gonna hate me, but i have to say that from what ive seen of the reviews on this site, more than half of the people writing them are being extremely foolish and are writing stupid, senseless things.<br />For the umpteenth time, i read the reviews on Nemesis and can only say WHATS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE?  How can you think this is bad?  For many, many truly awesome fantasy and sci-fi items, more than half the reviews are useless ranting that does no one any good, and basically all it says is: \\"I dont like it and since its me it must be right.\\"<br />So, anyway, i think that if all you're going to do is rant and give everyone a load of junk that couldnt be farther from the truth, stop writing reviews.<br />I want to make it clear, im not saying everyone who criticizes these items is just ranting, i have seen some legitimate examples of people explaining why they dont like books, or movies, or whatever.  The point is, those of you who write one line and say its trash, might as well just not write a review.<br />Now, to talk about the movie, i must say that i think it had an interesting plot.  It seemed like a cool idea to me (although i havent seen Wrath of Kahn, so i cant tell you if its similar to that), and i really think it is a decent movie.<br />Its true, it wasnt the same as the series was, there is a different atmosphere, which could be improved, but overall i think it is a good movie, and is worth seeing.
0385720920|5.0|this book is just incredible.. ok so i dont read all that much, but even so. this is on a fight club ish sense of thought, but even to a further level. it is a bit confusing, but if you have half a mind you should be able to understand it all..<BR>all in all, ithink chuck writes this very cleverly, and does a great job at it..
0671027387|3.0|Dan Brown is rapidly becoming one of my favorite authors.<br />His stories are all well written and sometimes researched ( to a point).<br />The story is a real page turner, and his characterizations are decent but not top notch.<br />However, in order to enjoy Dan Brown you have to get used to the fact that Brown ignores technical details in favor of dramatic license. It can be really annoying at times. For an author who does such thorough and accurate research into meteor geology, his ignorance of simple things becomes even more grating.<br />Here are two examples that will not spoil the novel for any who has not read it yet: It would be impossible for a 2 man sub to manhandle an 8 ton meteroite under water or otherwise. A solid mass just does not have enough bouyancy to offset the weight. The descriptions of the pressure effects on a body are total and absolute nonsense and do not really add that much drama to the story - I was too busy laughing.<br />There are plenty more, but I suppose they do not take away too much for the otherwise passable novel.<br />I like Dan Brown and I will probably read anything he writes. He is on my \\"B+\\" list. but Dan PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE get a technical advisor!!! Call me, I will do it for free. PLEASE.
B00005LK95|5.0|I love this movie and I watch it at least once a week. This Movie is next best to owning Johnny 5. I wish I could own J-5, but do not have the Big Bucks to by him even if he is real. The only thing wrong with this movie is some of the bad language, so I just fast forward some of the scences. I wish they would make more movies using Johnny 5, I would like to see Ben &amp; Sandy get married and J-5 as the Best Man. My Husband &amp; I rent DVD's and have kept this Movie since Oct., so I thought I better buy it, so I can return the rental to get to watch other DVD's. Great Movie that could be even better without the bad language...
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I was told that this film was the best of the year and an absolute must for any serious film collector. Subsequently, I purchased it. What a mistake. My friends and I watched the film, silently taking it all in, and kept waiting for some pulse. It has none. The dialogue is completely flat and there is nothing interesting about the characters whatsoever. The viewer cares nothing about them. We laughed a bit during Bill Murray's scene in which he appears on a talk show, but that was about it. The most appealing element was the cinematography, which was indeed beautiful.  I asked a friend who loved this film what the attraction was. She said it was &quot;so cute and sweet.&quot; There you have it.
0792846443|4.0|MISERY is one of those movies that gets better with each screening. A genuine edge-of-your-seat, suspense nail-biter by Rob Reiner (STAND BY ME) based on the novel by Stephen King. James Caan in one of his best roles in recent memory pays hommage to Jimmy Stewart in REAR WINDOW. He's the bed/wheelchair-ridden Paul Sheldon, a romance novelist whose car crashes near a remote Colorado town in the dead of winter.  He is saved and nursed to health by his so-called number 1 fan (Kathy Bates as Annie Wilkes) of his series of romance novels whose main character is a woman named 'Misery Chastain'. Annie Wilkes is one of moviedoms greatest characters in the history of cinema. Kathy Bates deserved her Oscar Winning Best Actress nod as the obsessed fan whose good Samaritan personality turns into that of jack the ripper. Her obsession with Sheldon and 'Misery' keeps him  secretly locked up in her home to w(right) what was wronged (in her own obsessed opinion) to her favorite literary character. He is literally a prisoner forced to write while he is nursing his injuries. There are many memorable scenes in this film especially the 'hobbling' scene. Annie finds out that Paul has been sneaking out of his locked room and snooping around while she's out. In order to keep him at bay, she literally has to break his ankles.  It is one of the most harrowing parts of the film.  Caan and Bates are both excellent. However, the forgotten standout performance is that of Richard Farnsworth as Buster, the small town sheriff whose investigative tenacity of the disappearance of Paul Sheldon was another bright spot in the film. Overall, a well crafted suspense film with three outstanding performances, good direction, and great production values (the wide outdoor winter scenes were a great contrast to the claustophobic indoor scenes).
076790592X|5.0|Mitch initially seems almost annoying - the perfect student that the teacher loves, but you soon learn why.  The way Mitch gradually loses touch with Morrie is reminiscent of how we don't keep in contact to so many that we promised; However, when Mitch sees Morrie on television and actually goes to visit him, the stretched but still intact bond between them is clearly visible.  As Mitch grows closer with Morrie in their Tuesday lessons, so does the reader.  Morrie teaches Mitch about common day epithets that surround us all, but Morrie gives more meaning to these words.  Albom turns this overused, typical storyline into a truly heartwrenching work.  The mere fact that this is a true story throws the reader into an even deeper shock - left there to ponder the meaning for hours.
0345350499|5.0|This novel is one of my favorites and I absolutely love it. In my Humanities class, we're assigned to read Malory's &quot;Le Morte D' Arthur&quot; for the Feudalism portion. But I wasn't interested and the nice teacher said that I can go along with Mists of Avalon after I explained what a great job Bradley did with it. I mean, with a book like this, I'm simply not interested in reading any other rendition of the Arthur legends. I'm not interested in that by itself and Bradley's book is so much more than that. The rest of the reviews here pretty much sums up everything else that I could say. Thank you Bradley for bringing life and personality to the characters of the Round Table and finally Avalon.
6304708491|4.0|I'm so happy to see that I'm not the only one who thinks &quot;Help!&quot; is never given enough credit by the critics! So it may not be as polished and serious a movie as &quot;Hard Day's Night,&quot; it's still a boatload of fun and the source of many a random quote spouted among friends (we're also big fans of the &quot;fiendish thingie&quot; line, too, earlier reviewer). So why can't we get the rest of the world to agree with us? Maybe they were expecting something straightforward rather than twisted? WEll, they're just boring. Anywhere you stumble upon a copy of this movie, GET IT.
B000002I53|5.0|My Favorite Things is my favorite album. The first track, My Favorite Things cooks. McCoy takes the first solo, but soon after comes in Trane takin down the house. The first song is 15 minutes of swingin avant garde jazz. Trane and his men take a whole new spin on But Not For Me, and Summertime just plain swings. (there's a ballad isn't there?) This is also the album that gave drummer Elvin Jones the recognition that he needed to soon be one of the most influential drummers of the sixties. This a landemark album, with killer material. Two words for you- BUY IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00003CXGP|3.0|For some reason, this movie is classified as horror.  It is not - it is a comedy: a very, very, very black comedy.  Just watch Christian Bale's over-the-top performance - everything is played for laughs.  The murders are not the focus of the film - rather it is Bale's narration as he comments on all things `80s: everything from his in-depth analysis of pop artists like Whitney Houston and Huey Lewis, to his grooming ritual, to whatever hot spots were popular in New York back then.<br />The eighties as satirized in the movie are an idea that never really existed - much like Patrick's idea of himself.  I vaguely remember some of the places he talks about in Manhattan, but they were trends - like anything else.  Even the yuppies back then who agonized over getting the right seat at the right restaurant and having the perfect look and business card didn't even really believe in those things themselves.  They were all playacting, whether they knew it or not.<br />It is a wise decision to downplay the horror aspects of the movie.  Sadly I have not read the book.  I hear that is very misogynistic.  I don't know about that but the hero-villain, Patrick Bateman, certainly is.  Violence against women is not something we need to see more of.  It is present in the film, so be prepared for some offensive scenes.<br />This movie, like other movies about the eighties, play best as nostalgia.  We can look at the cultural differences and say, \\"What the hell were we thinking.\\"  American Psycho is intent on giving us a good laugh.
0767802470|4.0|Be warned, regardless of the paeans you've heard sung to the movie, it is very 80s. It will begin VERY slowly, and won't let up until the end. A quasi-documentary format doesn't really do much to assuage the expectations you may have from a real Movie either.<br />We watch like bystanders as a German crew steers a U-Boat into the war. The movie is almost entirely indoors (inside a U-Boat, i.e.) which lends it an extremely cramped feel. Filmed in steadycam, the picture moves straight across the claustrophobic hall of the submarine. There is barely enough place for one man to stand and this feeling is expertly conveyed to film thanks to Jost Vacano's excellent cinematography.<br />As you may imagine with any movie of this general cadre, the theme actually couches a strong anti-war message. Our protagonist Capitain may have been under the reign of Hitler, but he didn't really look up to him. Barbs at almost everything related to the Fuerer abound. The strongest message is delivered in the film's denouement when the crew of our U-Boat faces the biggest dilemma: to save the drowning enemy men because they are human beings, or to let them shrivel and die because they are enemies. Poignant!<br />Caveats:<br />(1) A lot of the miniseries look blatantly filmed in a studio, nearly like like the opening sequence of Gilligan's Island. As much as I admire the realism, these cheesy effects do bring down the movie.<br />(2) If you don't mind subtitles, then watch the movie in its original Deutsche with English subtitles. The English dubbing is horrendous.<br />(3) Like all documentaries, there isn't much place for character development. Most of the characters are basically one-note and have little to no personality.<br />None of this undermines the sheer power of the movie's message, and the claustrophobia conveyed on film. I wonder if the flick is as legendary as it is toted to be, but it's a must-have gem in any true war-movies collection.
B00000AOUD|5.0|I'm among those who think this is Jethro Tull's finest album and that it arm wrestles with Dark Side of the Moon for the best art-rock album of the 70's.<br /><br />I would argue that to truly appreciate this album, you need to have an original vinyl copy of it--simply for the cover itself. It is one of those sprawling \\"spare no expense on the production\\" affairs. Half the fun of this album was leafing through the newspaper as you listened to the record with headphones on. I imagine a lot of people smoked weed to this album. I was too young to experience or appreciate the counter-cultural rites that might accompany a playing of Thick as a Brick, but I could certainly ponder the mightily obscure lyrics--starting with the title. It was quite a few years later that I finally realized that the phrase \\"thick as a brick\\" was the British equivalent of calling someone \\"dumb as a rock\\".<br /><br />Okay, so one mystery solved, but what the devil did the rest of it mean? Reading the lyrics now as an adult, the album doesn't seem nearly as difficult conceptually as it once did. There are a lot of ideas swirling around in those lyrics, for sure; however, if I were to take a stab at identifying a unifying theme for the album, I would suggest that the album is primarily singer Ian Anderson's critique of society's misplaced values.<br /><br />This is not too surprising, I suppose, to anyone who has listened to Jethro Tull's other early albums. On Thick as a Brick, Anderson rolls out his usual suspects for discussion (e.g. hypocrisy, class conflict, childhood indoctrination, and revolutions that replace old ideas with simply more of the same). There are no direct attacks on the Church of England that I can detect, but you can always turn to the Aqualung album for that critique. On a number of Tull albums, Anderson displays a good eye for observing social relationships and then dissecting them lyrically (Warchild comes to mind). One suspects that if he weren't so intent on being trying to be obscure, he might have made a good sociologist. Those who like clever descriptions and deep think metaphors in their rock lyrics will probably love this album; others may be baffled. Anyway, you get the point-there are not a lot of \\"I love you baby\\" sentiments to be found here. On the other hand, Tull sure knows how to mock the hell out of someone. They also have a firm grip on the absurd.<br /><br />That's not to say that the album is all about blasting away at Anderson's adversaries. There are a couple of goopy moments, where 70's era hippie profundities start seeping in into the lyrics (shudder). I suppose it was unavoidable in a concept album. But yes,..  at these points the lyrics seem very dated and Ian Anderson appears clearly as the twenty-something kid that he was-with a head full of cheese-whiz idealisms. Fortunately these moments are pretty brief (they add to the charm of the album anyway). Happily, even when Thick as a Brick is at its weakest conceptually, Tull still manages to avoid all the fantasy imagery of wizards, hobbits, and space travelers. You know,...  all the nonsense that so many of their peers got caught up in (e.g. Led Zepplin, Uriah Heep, Yes, and The Moody Blues). For a 1970s progressive rock band, it's pretty remarkable that Tull never got into all that time-traveler / wizard rock that was so predominate in other bands. I mean, even a garage band like the Rolling Stones went through a sci-fi & wizard phase! How did Tull manage to avoid it? My sense is that Anderson was a bit cantankerous and probably too much of a skeptic to enjoy all the dorky Lord of the Rings images that kept Robert Plant busy when he wasn't singing about his `nads. Anyway, who needs wizards, when you have organized religion and society to complain about?<br /><br />Ah well, I ramble, and I haven't even said anything yet about the great music. Don't worry, the other reviews will fill you in. I think its fair to say that most Jethro Tull fans think this albumis a masterpiece. I know I do. I'd take this album over Sgt. Pepper any day.ake this album over Sgt. Pepper any day.
B00001U0E1|5.0|Not many movies can move me so much that I cry. Because crying is an extremely rare thing for me. But that movie was made so passionately, that I could almost feel what the characters were, and cried when they were separated. This is a must see movie.
B000062X9B|5.0|110 people have reviewed this album before me, and they all agree that this is great. I don't care what kind of music you like. I don't care how old you are or where you're from or how smart you think you are. This is human music, raw and honest and true. If you have a soul, this album and Johnny Cash's voice will touch it. There is no better music.<br />I recommend American IV just as highly, and even more people like it. But check this one out as well.
B00000J6AG|1.0|As my title suggests, I was a bit disappointed with &quot;Play.&quot;  Before I listened to it, I had heard so much about Moby and was expecting a treat.<BR>The one song that really delivered was &quot;South Side.&quot;  Simply put, it sounds great.  It is catchy and upbeat and has great music.  I loved this song.  But the rest of the album isn't as skillfully made.<BR>Songs like &quot;Run On&quot;, &quot;Honey&quot;, &quot;Bodyrock&quot;, and &quot;Natural Blues&quot; COULD have been great, but are weighed down by excessive repetition.  Eventually, it gets to be too much, and I don't even listen to those songs.  Listen to the 30 second samples of those songs...and you have it all.<BR>And then, to top it off, there are those songs that are just completely horrible.  I'm not sure if &quot;Down Slow&quot; or &quot;Inside&quot; can even be called songs.  They don't really seem to have any sort of structure, just a few minutes of drum machine beats and wavering background music.  They are just no fun at all to listen to.<BR>Get &quot;South Side&quot; off of iTunes and leave it at that.

B00005JMJ4|5.0|For all of you folks out there screaming racism, it's time a Japanese-American (whose family lives in Kyoto) weighed in.  Please, get a life!  Being of Japanese heritage, I didn't see ANY racism in this movie, but can see how some well-meaning non-Japanese people (who probably haven't experienced real racism a single day in their lives) can superficially claim that this movie causes Japanese people pain. Puhleeze!<br />This movie lovingly sets the mood through the plot-vehicles of Tokyo and the Japanese, and it is a memorial by the director to a people and country she obviously has tremendous affection for.  Even better, it makes some of us action-freaks (like me, a HUGE Bruce Willis fan) slow down for just a bit and realize that a movie can be great by telling a simple story of 2 people who are lost culturally and emotionally, but against all odds create a beautiful dance of discovery at the cusp of much-needed change.  I've always enjoyed Bill Murray, and I applaud him for one of the best performances of the year.  Scarlett Johannson is a revelation.<br />There is no way that this movie is for everybody.  Some will love it immediately, some will find it an acquired taste, and I can easily seem some people bored to tears.  But angry?  No.
B0000B1OGD|5.0|When Ray Harryhausen was looking for new ideas, he came across an old script - intended for a never-made film - written by Willis O'Brien (creator and animator of RKO's 'King Kong').  Wth a little re-writing, this film came into being.  I remember seeing this film as a kid.  Personally, I think it's still as good now as it was then.  Ray Harryhausen's special effects are, as always, first-rate.  The story is both interesting and exciting, contains barely a dull moment.  Scenes of the cowboys riding into the forbidden valley, the little horse in its miniature stable, and the roping of the titular allosaur had stuck in my mind since I first saw this film.  Combining a western with a dinosaur movie was certainly a master-stroke.  The human characters are interesting, as are the dinosaurs - you really do feel sympathy for Gwangi at the finale.  The soundtrack is excellent, and the backgrounds are atmospheric and dramatic.  Besides this film, now looking better than ever, this DVD also contains an interesting look at the making of Gwangi, including interviews with Ray Harryhausen himself.  This is recommended whether you're a fan of dinosaurs or monster movies in general.
B000031WI8|5.0|If you are looking for a good comprehensive WHAM album, this is the best one available as of right now (February 2004).
0375703861|4.0|I enjoyed this book, but I will be the first the admit that it is not for the &quot;light reader.&quot;  Being an American, it took me a minute to get used to the English writer's style and use of language.  Once I got into her flow, it was smooth sailing.  This book is appropriately funny and poignant while remaining totally human.  I found myself laughing out loud at times.  Each character is developed beautifully and is deliciously flawed.  I cared about what happened to each of them in spite of themselves.  I love the way the author allowed them to evolve, progress, regress, or just simply be- according to their current circumstance.  The main thing I gleaned from this book is that the basic elements of the human condition are the same across cultures, races and classes.
B00013F38K|5.0|KUng Fu was originally slated to be a vehicle for the late great master, Bruce Lee. However, the network people did not believ that America was ready for an action hero that was Asian so they went back and re-wrote the script and made the character half chinese,and enlisted David Carridine,or the famous acting family. the result was an existential post-modern western,filled with eatsern mystcim and kung fu kickass. the premise of the show: an orpahned half american/half Chinese boy goes to the famous Shoalin temple to become a monk, and is forced to endure rigors before he's allowed inside. After an accident and a moment of anger, the now grown monk is forced to emigrate to the other home of his ancestors, america, filled with contempt for Chinese immigrants.Along the way he encounters various nasty Railroad overseers[the infrastructure of this country was bulit on the backs of slaves and immigrants in large parts],sherrifs and assasins sent by the Chinese government. Carradine is perfect in his portrayal as the taciturn monk/warrior,silent almost letting the breaths speak[alot of silence for a television show] the great Key Luke was on hand to deal with the flashbacks as young Caines mentor in the Saolin temple[Carridines younger brother Keith pays him in the pilot as a younger man].In all, a throughly enjoyable nostalgic trip ,and a good addition to the televison library. BTW the first season and the pilot are by far the best, and this is NOT TO BE CONFUSED WITH THE LATER LEGEND CONTINUES SERIES>
B00018D3RI|5.0|Starsky and Hutch is perhaps one of the best cop shows of the '70s (there was a lot of competition then), and easily one of the best ever.  It's about time that it's finally received the digital treatment it has so long deserved.<br />This was probably the first police drama that showed that cops could also be close friends and actually hang out together and have social lives.  All cop shows previously were of the Quinn Martin/Jack Webb/Hawaii 5-0 variety, where everything was done by the book and the principals--although professional--were somewhat cold and very one-dimensional and superficial.  This was also the first cop drama that showed that sometimes the rules have to be bent a little bit (and arms and god-knows-what-else broken!) in order to get the job done.  Hey, it was rough out there on the mean streets of the 1970s.<br />This DVD set is a little piece of history.  The first season is generally considered the best of the four, so this is the one to get.  Lots of extras too, including an in-depth look at the Gran Torino that STILL has to be the coolest car ever telecast.
B0000YWKHC|5.0|This film is wonderful; it captures the very essence of loneliness and the desire to connect with someone.  The acting is terrific - Bill Murray almost seems to be not acting at all.  The sound and cinematography are beautiful.  This film is truly a piece of art.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|I just FOUGHT hard to watch this movie today after renting it and I lost the battle.  It angers me that so many critics put this piece of trash on their best of 2003 lists and that it is nominated for  BEST PICTURE Oscar when it is not deserving of anything grand!!!!!  I will not even get into the story because there hardly is one.  It is supposedly about a middle aged man having a mid-life crisis and a young woman unsure of where to go in life meeting, yada yada yada......the sad thing is the movie definitely did not have me care about Bill Murray's character &quot;Bob Harris&quot;.  Murray is up for BEST ACTOR?????  Ick!!!!!!!  He does not do much the entire movie.  Scarlet Johanssen has major talent and will go far!!!!  That much I could tell!  The movie is spotty, boring, blah blah blah.....COLD MOUNTAIN should have been nominated for BEST PICTURE in its place.  It was deserving!!!!  Critics proved with this something I have ALWAYS believe......their praise does not equal a great movie!!  F!!!!!!!
6305537321|1.0|The two main characters of this story are a gold digger and a male prostitute.  They're shallow and unlikable which, of course, is what you would expect from a gold digger and a male prostitute.  The whole thing romanticizes the whatever-floats-your-boat mentality that Hollywood was beginning to peddle to the public in the 1950's and continues to peddle to this day.  Its ending was clearly contrived to manipulate the emotions of the audience almost as if to force them to accept the two unrepentant morally bankrupt main characters.  The attempts at wit throughout the film were just embarrassing; even the name Holly Golightly makes me cringe.  After seeing Audrey Hepburn in great movies like Sabrina and Roman Holiday, this was a heartbreaking disappointment.    If you were offended by ``The Bridges of Madison County'' and ``The English Patient'' on moral grounds, then this movie is also not for you.  References to this movie as an ``old fashioned romance'' may only be thought of as strange.  If you're a classic fashion buff who was impressed by Audrey Hepburn's style in ``Sabrina'' and ``Roman Holiday'' or even ``Funny Face'', you may also be disappointed by the 1960's-ishness of some of the clothing here that doesn't date well---it's especially unflattering of her extremely thin figure.    Just one last thing---I might have made it appear that this movie might even be offensive enough to stop it from being boring.  No, it's boring.  You want a good old fashioned cry by the end of the movie?  You can have that cry over the fact that you've just thrown away a couple valuable hours of your life you ain't never gettin' back.
B0000VAFNQ|3.0|To tell the truth I haven't seen very many vampire movies...and Underworld with Kate Beckinsale doesn't do much to inspire me to continue with the genre.  The plot was confusing where it shouldn't be...with background information.  In other words, this movie left me feeling like I might have missed some crucial piece of information in the first half when that piece of information was never actually given.  Not revealing the climax of the movie in the first 45 minutes is one thing, but a little more background would have been nice early on.  Also, there were just too many hard to follow &quot;shoot 'em up&quot; scenes...with the exception of the main characters I found it difficult to determine who was on whose side during many of the action sequences.  The main redeeming quality of the movie is the special effects...the morphing scenes from human to werewolf are pretty cool.  But that fact aside, the overall storyline was extremely thin...with several minor plotlines seemingly vanishing in midstream (primarily a plotline about a wannabe vampire queen) and a very unfleshed-out, spartan romantic connection between the main female and male protagonists.  Overall, if you're not into vampire movies this one is probably not a must-see.
0316666343|4.0|A very good novel but incrediably sad. I cried at least 4 or 5 times while I was reading it. Though sad its not really depressing. I found the end a bit of a dissapointment about how we don't find out why she fell from heaven or what became of Ruth. (Though I don't want to give away the whole plot)The only reason I've given it 4 stars instead of 4 was because it was so sad.
B000000OY9|5.0|I really do like this album, Neil's guitar is flaring on quit abit on the songs. To be honest is not as bad as everyone thinks, Neil's voice sounds as good as usal, the drums/symthizers don't sound bad, to me its a good change.<BR>Plane and simple you have to be a Neil Young fan to like this album...if you are, put this one in your online shopping cart and check out you won't be disapointed. But, if your not a Neil Young fan or new to Neil, I recommend you start with Live Rust, or Harvest...as well as many others
B00005JN08|1.0|This has got to be one of the worst and most offensive films to ever be made in the U.S.! How could the directors of this movie ever humiliate us Americans, while strongly offending the Europeans?! Why?!<BR>Both the commerical and the official site even seem offensive to Europeans! In this movie, it seems the directors want people to perceive Europeans as drunks, sex-addicts and even idiots! <BR>Good work to the directors of this film! <BR>In this movie, a bunch of Americans go to Europe for a vacation. They eventually just go around and cause trouble while making the Europeans that they visit, seem like idiots!<BR>I would strongly not advise you to see this film! It seems more embarrassing that it is humorous! That is basically it! <br />DO NOT SEE THIS HORRIBLE FILM!!!
B000002J1U|4.0|At first I was taken aback by this album.  I thought it was pretty weird.  After a few listens though it grows on you.  I'm not a huge acoustic fan but I like this album.  Gallows Pole, Bron-Y-Aur Stomp, and Immigrant Song are great.  If you are new to Zep, buy this album later.
B000005JA8|2.0|The artist here is just getting some joy out of 'letting go' to the non-sensical part of human experience.Its the extreme opposite of say, classical music ...which taps into the well-defined emotions.Even if the emotion is negative in classical music, it tends to be smooth and clean, void of confusion.Here, each emotion is based in confusion, therefore the music itself follows suit.<br />If you want to have a clear picture of what non-sensicality sounds like (not derogetory), you may enjoy this, and understand its shapelessness.Though in saying that, the humour here does have one consistency.It is 'dark' humour, expressed with a general vulgarity.I suppose I'm a sucker for 'structured' dark humour, which is why it didn't appeal to me, personally.But if structure ain't 'your' desire, who knows? This might be likeable to you.U must be able to stomach a bit of vulgarity, though.
B000002J03|5.0|I haven't been a Zep fan for that long, probably 6 years - but this is a must have CD.  Every song is pure Zep goodness.  I don't like Whole Lotta Love as much as most people do, but it's still a great song.  Moby Dick and The Lemon Song are gems.  Buy this album now.
B000002NJS|5.0|I believe that this is the last cd by madonna which is actually worth buying because everything after this is horrible.The songs on here are really great because they have fantastic beats to them and her singing really sounds amazing.I really like this album and I would recommend any fan of hers to own this one and skip all her later efforts because they stink.She needs to retire now because shes lost her ability to make great music anymore and is selling out and becoming trendy now.
1400034779|5.0|Everyone loves these books, and no one can really narrow down why they are so utterly lovable.<br />It would say it is in part due to the sheer simplicity of the writing, the divine descriptions of nature and the beauty of the image McCall Smith portrays of Botswana. The foriegn-ness of the themes and the exotic-ness of the main story relating to the witch doctor, as well as the colours and life of the covers.<br />Additionally, the lovability of characters, particularly the main character, with her completely un-Western notion of the body beautiful, her enduring sensitivity regarding the death of her baby and her enchanting love of her father. The devotion of her fiance is also gorgeous.<br />Perhaps the appeal of these works is the fact they suggest a fundamental life we essentially aspire for. Simplicity, kindness, nature, beauty. Such a different life than we of the Western world.
B0000CEB4V|5.0|This concert was incredible and moving but an earlier reviewer got it right about the audio. The sound seems to fade in and out at times.  At first I thought there's something wrong with my machine but obviously others have the same problem.<br />I don't have many DVD concerts but in general I haven't been happy with the audio on most of them.  I guess in a couple of years they'll come out with a Remastered Concert for George and include unseen footage and stiff us for $40-50 bucks.<br />The company that made the DVD should rerecord and provide free exchanges.
B000021Y7X|5.0|You won't find a better DVD that is focused on a concert than this one.  Those people in the audience were very lucky to have been there for this concert.
B0000UJL96|4.0|I remember seeing this in the cinemas back when it came out, and I thought it was OK.  After watching it twice on DVD now (listening to the director's and writer's commentaries), I found it even more enjoyable, proof that the ST movies with the original cast and crew are still better than those that followed them.  A good addition to my ST collection.  A couple of questions to other fans out there: did your copy of this DVD come without a printed chapter index (insert)? and why is the picture printed on disc two an upside down still picture of the Enterprise-B (from &quot;ST: Generations&quot;, not from ST VI)?  Or did I get a misprinted disc?  The only reason I didn't give it five stars was because Mike Okuda's text commentary was sparse at best, not much to learn when fans want so much to know...

B0001AP12G|5.0|I was a Kanye fan before I even knew it. &quot;Heart Of The City&quot;, &quot;This Can't Be Life&quot;, and one of many many other faves of Jay-Z, &quot;Lucifer&quot;--all of these Hova hits were produced by Kanye. Or a more widely known song like &quot;You don't know my name&quot;, from songstress/writer/producer Alicia Keyes. But it was &quot;Through The Wire&quot; and &quot;Slow Jamz&quot; that blew my mind. After which, made me do some homework. And I found that Jay-Z even shouts out to him on a few of his songs from previous cd's. Each new Kanye finding was IMPRESSIVE!<br />Okay, the cd. &quot;College Dropout&quot;. The first installment of what I think is the future of the ROC--in a BIG, BIG WAY. I was....<BR>SALIVATING, PERSPIRING--waiting with BAITED BREATH for this album to drop. Jay was the best out for so long (a personal tragedy for me when he retired), his was the only hip hop I bought since 1997--the only rap music worthy of my dollar. <BR>I was lost when he said he would retire--because I love hip hop soooo much. Who is good enough to listen to/patronize now?<br />Feb. 10, 2004 was my answer. Kanye, like Jay, is more than rap. Kanye is a spoken word artist; a poet over tight beats. The man is a genius. He found a way to thread hip hop, poetry, r&amp;b, soul--oh my God, VIOLINS, tamborines--GOSPELL, y'all!! And the right amount of comedy. A def flow that'll change up with each song. The guest appearances only added to this five star cd; among them, to name a few, are: Mos Def, Jay-Z, Syleena Johnson, Ludacris, Talib Kwali, Jamie Foxx, Twista, and more!<br />His rhymes are meaningful, they make you think. I like that in an emcee. I like to hear intricate songs that don't reveal everything in one listen. I read some other reviews. Some said the skits took away somehow from the cd. Personally, I think they added to it, completely. I like skits on a cd, sometimes they help set a tone for an album. Or in kanye's case, it allows us to glimpse at the artist'ssense of humor.<br />The theme &quot;College Dropout&quot; overall seems to clearly state or boast at defiant arrogance. But an underlying sense of futility is felt. It's almost as if dropping out was a hard decision to face for him. I can whole-heartedly agree and relate to his struggle. A more clear message is a truth many college students find, however reluctant. And that is, that &quot;college isn't for everybody, and maybe, just...maybe it isn't for me&quot;. His try and the fail of it is also there (read the credits, people).<br />This product is well-deserving of all the hype. My Fav-O-rite skits/jams, (not in any particular order) are:<br />1. Intro* AND Graduation Day* (skits with Deray [the bootleg seller from barbershop--&quot;cd's, dvd's&quot;, sound familiar?] impersonating Bernie Mac).<BR>2. All Falls Down*<BR>3. Spaceship*<BR>4. Jesus Walks*<BR>5. Get em high*<BR>6. Never Let Me Down** ('cause Kanye AND Jay-z spit this one)<BR>7. (skit) Workout Plan w/ the ghetto girls (very funny)*<BR>8. New Workout Plan (song)<BR>9. Slow Jamz (of course--and this is an extended version)***<BR>10. (skits) School spirit 1 &amp; 2<BR>11. (song) school spirit<BR>12. (skit) Lil Jimmy<BR>13. Two words*<BR>14. Through the Wire**(of course)<BR>15. Last call (a toast to the ROC, &quot;mister Roc-A-Fella&quot;/also, a bit of a bio of Kanye's road to the Roc--WARNING: this last number is a little long, but very interesting)<BR>16. Breathe in Breath out<BR>17. Family Business <br />Well, folks, that's actually the whole cd. It's definitely one of the great ones, as another reviewer said--&quot;an instant classic&quot;. The next of the Roc to drop, The Young Gunz, is another album I'm impatiently waiting for. The future of La Roc Familia looks bright as hell and I wanna be there to see it shine. <BR>Yo, why are you waiting? Cop that disc! Unless every place you went it was sold out--like it was for me for days. Days, people, days!! I'm talking bout Best Buy, Circuit City, the malls here--everywhere. I had to keep calling around.<BR>Tip: Don't buy cd's at Target or Walmart, they censure their music, people.
0385504209|2.0|Although every once in a while THE DA VINCI CODE proves to be intriguing and presents some interesting religious and political issues, the misinformation and juvenile style of writing is taxing, to say the least. I have not studied the Priory of Sion or Opus Dei extensively, but the obnoxious 'FACT' page at the beginning of the book poses the question of just how and why Dan Brown is privy to all of these secrets of the Catholic church, and the alleged sexual rituals of Sion, among other things. If he would cite his sources when he occasionally stumbled upon a fact or two and used some other form of notation when he let his imagination get the best of him, the book would be slightly more credible.<br />  In addition to the questionable credibility of the CODE, it was embarrassing to read Brown's attempt at dialouge, particularly when he was discussing advanced symbolism with his college students as well as the college inmates. I cringed as Brown's writing was immediately reduced to that of a small child, as every revelation Langdon the symbologist came to was greeted by astonishment by his various \\"classes\\". The situation was similar as Langdon and Teabing, the wealthy protector of the seekers of the holy grail, informed Sophie, Langdon's accomplice, about the grail, and I found it difficult to maintain my composure during these particularly painful passages.<br />  It is interesting that out of all the books on the market, the public has chosen to embrace this one.
B00005RJ1U|4.0|Stylish, scary horror film that is one of the most creative and original to come around in years. It's good old-fashioned horror at it's best, with a hip cast and returning director Victor Salva.<br />Whilst Trish (Gina Philips) and her brother Darry (Justin Long) are driving back from college for summer break, they are run off the road by a monstrous and ugly, beat-up truck with the license plate &quot;BEATINGU.&quot; Later on, they see the same truck again by an old church and realize that the driver is shoving a body down a dark pipe. When the siblings go back to investigate and try to help, what they find is beyond their wildest nightmares...and actually apart of a local psychic who knows what is going to happen next to the brother and sister.<br />The only complaint I have about this film is the fact that the ending becomes very silly, and the way the creature becomes naked looks very computerish and spoils the old-fashioned feel of the film which is part of what made it so frightening. However, the VERY end is quite creepy and as I've already said, this is one of the best horror films to come around in years. Enjoy.
B00006V9A0|5.0|This cd includes songs from all of nirvanas albums. Except the album from the muddy banks of wishika. The only bad thing about this album is that it only has one new unreleased song. But I still love this cd. You \\"know your right\\" is a great song. Kurt Cobain is an icon who will never been forgotten. He's almost been dead for ten years and people still listen to his music. People like me. But he married a psycho, Courtney wanted all the money for this album which had a big fight with Dave grohl and kris noveselic. The surviving members of nirvana. That tells you right there she had something to do with Kurt Cobains murder. How could people not like this band. This is the greatest band of all time. It has the greatness in every single song. It sucks that Kurt cobain was murdered, he didn't commit suicide. I think that's why people don't like this band because they think he committed suicide. The best album though was nevermind. If you could only get one nirvana album I suggest you get nevermind. These are the songs and which album they are in. <BR>1.you know your right (unreleased) <BR>2.about a girl (bleach: first album) <BR>3.been a son (incectiside:third album) <BR>4.sliver(incectiside:third album) <BR>5.smells like teen spirit (nevermind:second album) <BR>6.come as you are(nevermind:second album)<BR>7.lithium(nevermind:second album)<BR>8.in bloom(nevermind:second album) <BR>9.heart shaped box(in utero: fourth album) <BR>10.Pennyroyal Tea (in utero:fourth album)<BR>11.rape me(in utero:fourth album)<BR>12Dumb (in utero:fourth album) <BR>13.All Apologies (unplugged version)<BR>14.The Man Who Sold The World (unplugged version)
B00003CXXP|2.0|Don't read this review if you have not seen the movie - contains spoilers!<br />This movie gained my attention in the beginning of the film because I found the interactions between David and the human family interesting and I thought it raised a number of interesting questions regarding potential futuristic technology. However, as others have pointed out, the movie moves away from this storyline and begets a sort of fairly tale which I think effectively crushes the credibility of it being a true sci-fi film. I think what makes a good sci-fi film is that although you know what you are viewing is not possible in our present time, you believe that the existence of such a world is possible at some point in the future. And thus you buy into the storyline. However, a fairy tale is much different. A fairy tale is what we recognize as something you may wish for but realize that it can never be. In the beginning of the movie, it feels as though we are watching a sci-fi film. We are watching a story in the future that although obviously does not exist in our present society, has potential to exist in our futures. But I felt as though just as I was beginning to understand and wrap myself up in the film and in the story of this young boy, (and of coming to terms with New York being an underwater city!) the movie makes an abrupt shift to 2,000 years in the future. <br />Not to mention that the middle of the film is very peculiar! We move from the beginning of the film, which is David's life with his family to a story about how technology has created these machines that may or may not possess human tendencies and emotions. Only one of these machines do we come to know as a character in the film. A rather charismatic gigolo named \\"Joe.\\" But although Joe is certainly very likeable, he is not developed enough as a character for us to really care about what happens to him. If Spielberg is trying to make a point here, it fails. Spielberg does not develop the machines as characters (other than David) so how are we supposed to feel for their potential (though not realized) demise? <br />So that said, what is the moral of Spielberg's story? Are we supposed to question what life in the future may become? Are we supposed to realize that the life we have available to us now may one day be a life that others can only dream of and wish that they had? I don't know, because the movie doesn't seem to offer any opinions on such things. It is one thing to raise questions, but I think a movie also needs to provide not answers, but a direction or an opinion on such things that we then can contemplate, accept or reject.<br />And what is the lesson of David waiting underwater for 2,000 years for his wish to be granted? Persistence pays off? If we all are willing to wait 2,000 years our dreams will eventually come true, even if only for a day? Don't you think David could have done something a little more productive with his 2,000 years of life besides waiting under water for the blue fairy to grant him a wish?! I'm all for movies that make you think, but at least have a question or point worth pondering!
B000050FEN|5.0|Seven is the most disturbing movie I have ever seen.  I was in a state of shock when I walked out of the theater.  After the shock wore off, I was depressed.  Eventually I said to myself, &quot;That was an awesome flick!&quot;  However, I always warn people before I recommend it.  I tell them they won't walk out of that theater feeling good.  And it might be a quiet ride home in the car.  Kudos to the director for going with a nontraditional ending.  I plan on wathcing Seven again, tomorrow night (on DVD).  I've upped my prozac dosage in anticipation.
B000099T2L|5.0|This CD is the bomb!! I love almost everysong on here. Me, myself and I is the best song in the world. Yes, signs, speechless,&amp; Be with you follow right behind it. if you don't have this album GET IT!! There's lots of songs on there i can relate to. THis CD is good if you wanna just chill at home or cuddle up with your man.
B0000508U6|3.0|Coldplay is one of the most overrated bands since dave matthews, and the radiohead comparisons are extremely far off, radiohead being the much better band and a much different sounding band, but still, chris martin writes catchy, pretty melodies, and even though the band is pretty simple technically, they don't need to be any better and use what they have well. A debut that might hint at greater things in the future, but probably not, they just don't have much personality.
6305127697|5.0|The story revolves around an alter boy named Aaron Stampler (Edward Norton) that is accused of murdering a priest. Media hungry lawyer Martin Vale (Richard Gere) sees it as the perfect opportunity to gain exposure and help his career. But as the events of the case unfold, he begins to care more about his client and proving his innocence. Martin is set to face off against the assistant D.A. ( Laura Linney), who is also an ex lover of his. With tension mounting on all sides, it is up to Martin to put his career aside, and find the truth. <br />Primal Fear is one of the best courtroom dramas that you will ever see. The story unfolds brilliantly. You are never quite sure if Aaron is guilty or innocent, and you will be guessing for the whole movie. The ending is my favorite aspect of the movie because of how shocking it was. It is definately not your typical Hollywood ending. <br />The acting is wonderful all the way around. Edward Norton's portrayal of Aaron Stampler is amazing. It takes talent to be able to play both roles so convincingly. One is the sweet and innocent altar boy that is innocent of the crime. The other is the split personality induced madman named Roy. Norton turns both roles on at the drop of a hat, and it is really fun to see. Richard Gere was the perfect choice for Martin Vale. You see two sides to the character as the film unfolds. One is the cocky and selfish lawyer who only cares about his career. The other is the man who comes to care about Aaron. Gere does a great job on both ends. Laura Linney is explosive. Her scenes as the prosecutor are filled with passion and energy. There is also great chemistry between her and Gere because they are ex lovers. I love that aspect of the film, because the case becomes more personal to both of them. Whether Aaron is really guilty or innocent becomes almost secondary to them, because they seem to be more concerned with beating each other. Frances McDormand is also outstanding as Aaron's psychologist Dr. MollyArrington. <br />I have seen many courtroom dramas, but &quot;Primal Fear&quot; is definately one of the best. The hard hitting and emotional story, great all around acting, and surprising ending really make this movie great. The DVD does not really have much in the way of extras, so I recommend going with the VHS version in this case.
0385510438|1.0|With all the hype,I really thought Grisham was back. I was wrong. This book drags on with very little excitement and no great charactars. What a waste of money.
B000089RVX|5.0|I already have this CD for a very long time but I can't get enough of it. It has such powerfull songs, sung in a beautiful way. I love Amy's voice, it's haunting.<br />Going Under:<BR>Great song! Evanescence wanted it to be the first single because it's a good reflection of what they are, but the record company taught differently.<br />Bring Me To Life:<BR>Very different from the other songs on the album but still very good.<br />Everybody's Fool:<BR>Rumours are that this is going to be 4th single, I like this song very much but it's not my favorite. I understand why they would release it as a single though, it's very radio friendly.<br />My Immortal:<BR>I love this song, it's beautiful. I'm amazed a 15 year old can write this, Ben is really talented. Amy sings it great. It's a shame that they put the demo version on Fallen and not the Band Version, but it's still beautiful.<br />Haunted:<BR>One of my favorites on the album. As in the title it's very haunting and the music and lyrics are great.<br />Tourniquet:<BR>Great song, it totally rocks! It's really strong with a good message.<br />Imaginary:<BR>Also one of my favorites, if the rumours are wrong about Everybody's Fool I would like this song to be the 4th single. I think it would make a great video.<br />Taking Over Me:<BR>Very good song, I love it. Very strong.<br />Hello:<BR>I had to get used to this song, but now it's one of my all time favorite ballads. It's a beatiful song and Amy shines in it.<br />My Last Breath:<BR>Great songs, one of my favorites! It's a great rock song with strong lyrics.<br />Whisper:<BR>I'm totally into Whisper, it's such a powerfull song with great lyrics and music. I'm loving it!<br />I love this album, it's my favorite in my collection. You wont regret buying this!
B000002C2E|2.0|I'm sorry, but I just don't get these glowing reviews. I came to this album with high hopes. I hadn't heard Dylan since Blood on the Tracks, am not a dedicated fan, but I've admired a lot of his stuff over the years ever since Bringing It All Back Home.  Marvelous stuff.<br />And this??  A stupefying avalance of cliches and forced rhymes driving lyrics that left me bewildered and disappointed. Most of these songs are terrible! Emotionally raw? Okay, but so is a lot of high school poetry that nobody would ever think to publish. The dark distillation of a lifetime of pain? Maybe, but all I hear is a guy feeling sorry for himself for everything everybody's done to him, with rarely a glimmer of self-insight or reponsibility. The whole world is on his case, you know.  <br />There were three moving songs that made me think Dylan's still got it -- Tryin' to Get to Heaven, Standing in the Doorway, and especially Not Dark Yet -- and musically a lot of it was interesting, but from anybody but Bob Dylan, most of these songs would never have gotten out of the studio. And I suspect that a lot of listeners who are not Dylan fans would agree with me. Try hearing it and pretending it's not Dylan, but a new artist you've never heard of. It won't make you think of Blood on the Tracks, that's for sure.
B00005JMJ4|3.0|The movie is not that great, but like many debuts is an honest attempt.  I'll give her props for that, but this year's selection must have been pretty grim for LiT to win all those awards.  And yes, there is a strange undercurrent of racial ignorance and stereotyping.  Either that or it's meant to bring us into Scarlett and Bill's (characters') drunken, self-absorbed perspective on things.  Depressing, disappointing - they were not good for each other, did not understand each other, and left each other more jaded than when they met.  Not that it has to be feel-good to be a good film, but let's at least bring it all into perspective.
B000062YAZ|5.0|Slayer kick so, so, so much ass with this album. If you don't have this album, please go buy it...All the other metal albums I've heard (which is a lot)pale in comparison. Metallica's Ride the Lightning comes close, but what's really admirable about this album is how they perfectly combine all the best aspect of hardcore punk and metal to create something that is so beautiful...if you don't like it at first, try listening to it a few more times, and remember to play it very LOUD! This music is delivered with so much energy and it sounds vital and alive. I would also recommend Hell Awaits. To my ears, this the greatest, most perfect thrash album ever recorded.
0440237688|5.0|Any reader of any age can find something appealing in \\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry.  It is the tale of a young boy, Jonas, who lives in a world of sameness, free of pain, but also missing color, individuality, and true emotion.  When Jonas is selected by his elders to become the next Receiver, the most honorable position in the community, he has no idea what to expect.  As his training progresses, he learns of an entirely different world, of an Elsewhere, filled with pain and delight, misery and bliss.<br />I read \\"The Giver\\" as a child, and was spell-bound by the story it told.  Reading this book as a child, I was able to relate it to experiences in my own life: my own happiness, my own sorrow, my own pain.  I recently read \\"The Giver\\" a second time, now as a senior in high school, and the book has taken on an entirely new meaning.  I could relate the story to my own search for individuality as I head away from home and into the world.<br />I would highly recommend \\"The Giver\\" to anyone of any age.  This novel can be read a hundred times, and each time it will mean something different to the reader.
B0000CGV00|3.0|Yo yo yo. Dis cd was straight trippin doe.

B0000DYJM6|5.0|I am not a great Pearl Jam fan, although I own all their studio albums and a few live albums, but I can easily say that this is their best album ever. I can't believe and understand why these selections never made it to an album. They're really good. It's a great selection, the songs are versatile as opposed to some of their other albums. I love both CDs. I can't get tired of it. It's also a great introduction to Pearl Jam, even though it doesn't have the hits. I prefer this kind of collection than a best of with the hits.
B0001BKAEY|5.0|Saying that THE MATRIX REVOLUTIONS is the best Matrix movie, is like saying that if an active nuclear bomb is thrown on a match, the match will break.<BR>This is my favourite film after THE LORD OF THE RINGS:THE RETURN OF THE KING,which is the best film I have ever seen.<BR>The story of the film is this(don't worry,no spoilers!):<BR>After Neo's mysterious victory over the Sentinel,his mind is trapped in a programm between the Matrix,and the real world. As for his body, he is(in a comma aucorse)in the real world.<BR>Unable to use his special powers to escape,his survival rests on the hands of Trinity,Morpheus,and Seraph,who begin their own quest inside the Matrix.<BR>Meanwhile,one of Smith's clones who managed to arrive at the real world is in a comma,but because of his different form(he has been installed in the body of Bane),no one even suspects his true identity.<BR>As for the soldiers  of Zion,loaded with huge robots under their control,they wait for a giagantic attack from the Sentinels to Zion.<BR>The script is very well written(unlike THE MATRIX RELOADED you never get bored),the directors have done a wonderfull job with the scenes,and as for the special effects,they're much better then RELOADED-Remember how awfull the fases of the Smiths looked during the Burly Brawl scene,in RELOADED? Well,in this movie,forget that.Here all of Smith's faces look just perfect and normal.<BR>As for the Super Burly Brawl(I think that's how they named that scene),it's the best action scene I have EVER seen.<BR>Just a tip:Although this movie is masterpiece,if you didn't like the previous Matrix movies,do not even think watching this one.You'll hate it.
B000069AUI|5.0|hi I like many others am a big coldplay fan, but im sure u all know how brilliant coldplay are so I am here plugging another British band called Gomez. Gomez however are nothing like coldplay interms of music (and are not as commercially successful), but they are just as sensational. Best way i can describe their music is as chilled out and blues- type music. Every track from their albums is brilliant and impossible to dislike. So people try them by listening to the previews on this website, and u will not be dissapointed.. guaranteed..... ENJOY
B000021Y77|5.0|Run Lola Run is one of my all time favorite movies ever! The imagery, music and story all fit together so well. I would deffinately recomend this movie to anyone thinking of buying or even renting it.
B00009NOF4|5.0|This is one of my favorite Radiohead albums. Honestly I'd only recommend it to a Radiohead fan. It's definatly an aquired taste, and I don't think somebody who wasn't really &quot;into&quot; Radiohead would enjoy it that much. If you're new to Radiohead, go for Ok Computer before this. Otherwise, I'd put this on the same level as Kid A and Ok Computer which IMO were the 2 other best albums.
B000065V9P|5.0|This is simply the best album that has ever been made on this planet... It is... All 10 tracks are superb... Produced by master Daniel Lanois and Peter Gabriel. Just an amazing album.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|&quot;Lost in Translation&quot; captures the mood of feeling lost and out of place in life, which is echoed cinematically by being lost in an unfamiliar city and culture. This isn't a movie that moves very quickly or that has direction -- it's all about conveying a mood and atmosphere.
B00008NRI8|1.0|Movie started out promising and then went nowhere, but seemed to last a long time.
B0000025YM|5.0|One of the best Priest albums ever!! All of the tracks on this album are great! Starting off with &quot;freewheel burning&quot;, it set`s the standard for the whole album. From there on it`s kind of a metal parade, that makes you wanna ROCK HARD...and RIDE FREE!! When &quot;The Sentinel&quot; arrives you just have to keep on Rocking, you can`t relax at all! This song you can play til you drop!..it get`s me everytime! The raw &quot;eat me alive&quot; and &quot;when the night comes down&quot; are also tracks that you will play over and over again. So THUMBS up and 5 stars for Halford,Tipton &amp; K.K. Downing!!
B00004YYDI|1.0|Found myself wanting to put a bullet through Leons head at the end of this movie...well if he still had a head.<BR>Very unreal movie and that doesnt have to be a bad thing normaly but well...not if its meant to be like reality.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|but now I'm happy.  Firefly was barely promoted when it was airing and I only caught it by channel surfing.  Started watching one of the later episodes, &quot;Out of Gas&quot; and after watching that single episode, I was hooked.  The network never gave it a chance!  Plus they didn't even air the pilot until after the show was cancelled.  Anyway, I think if they had made &quot;Out of Gas&quot; the first episode, this show could have made it (this episode works well as an intro and it's even better when you don't know who the characters are).  This show's got interesting characters, great lines, and great plot.  This DVD set has high quality video and let's you catch up on all the episodes you missed.  So I recommend you all watch &quot;Out of Gas&quot; first, then the rest of the episodes in order.
B0000DD7LB|5.0|Britney has recorded the album of her career. Britney has transformed her self from a sexy school girl to a provocative young sexy woman. This album swings from genre to genre, with every song being unique<br />1. Me Against The Music - This is my fav track on the album. It was the collaboration that made my dreams come true. The song is an up-beat club track that is very catchy and makes you come back for more. 10/10<br />2. (I Got That) Boom Boom - This is my third fav track on the album. This is the most Hip-hop track on the record. Ying Yang Twins feature in this song giving it a dirrty ghetto sound too it. This song very club orientated and very upbeat. 10/10<br />3. Showdown - This song is a reat dance song and very sexy which is produced by Bloodshy & Avant. 9/10<br />4. Breathe On Me - This is my FAV song on the album, and also my all time favourite song of all time. This song is very club-savvy orienated and is one of the most sensual track on the album. The song is upbeat and is very unique. This song will go straight to #1 in europe if it is released as a single. 10/10<br />5. Early Mornin - The second this track commences you automatically know it is Moby produced. The is very sexy and has a very trancy vibe to it. Very different for Britney. 8.5/10<br />6. Toxic - The second single from the album which is produced by Bloodshy & Avant once again. This song is HOT. This song could be used as the theme song to Alias or the next bond movie. This song is my 5th fav on the album. It is very sexy and is probably the most upbeat song on the album. This song is also very original and also very clubby. 10/10<br />7. Outrageous - The second this song commences you automatically know it is R.Kelly produced. It is an R&B uptempo club track that is very sexy and catchy. 10/10<br />8. Touch Of My Hand - This is the most sensual song on the album. This song is Britney's most mature song to date. This song has a very cool vibe to it and is my third fav on the album. 10/10<br />9. The Hook-up - I'm not crazy on this song, but i still think it is ok. It has a Reggee R&B feel to it. This is a song i always skip BUT I DON'T HATE IT. 6/10<br />10. Shadow - This song shows Britney's vocals at her best. This has to be one of my Favourtie Britney ballads to date. The song is very fresh although it does sound alot like Avril Lavigne's I'm With You. 10/10<br />11. Brave New Girl - The only thing i can say about this song is that it is one of the worst songs i have ever heard in my life. 0/10<br />12. Everytime - This is a very nice song. This song reminds me of the days britney was innocent. Her vocals aren't very strong in this song but goes well with the mood of the song. I Still love this song. 10/10<br />13. Me Against the Music (Remix) - I Love this remix. It has a very indian vibe to it and is very clubby and upbeat. Rishi Rich did an excellent job. 10/10<br />14. The Answer - This is one of the Australian bonus tracks and is produced by P.Diddy. This song has a very R&B feel to it is very P Diddish. I loved this song although when i heard the idea of Britney & P.Diddy working together i was expecting more, even though i still love this song. 9/10<br />15. Don't Hang Up - This is another Australian bonus track. This song is very mid tempo. I think this song and Brave New Girl are the only songs on this cd i don't like. By The way They are both produced by Brian & Josh. I think on her next album she should stay away from these producers. 3/10<br />ALL IN ALL I LOVE THIS CD AND I DON'T THINK IT COULD HAVE GOTTEN MUCH BETTER. THIS SHOWS ALBUM SHOWS WHAT BRITNEY IS BEST AT. THIS ALBUM DESERVES TO BE HER HIGHEST SELLING ALBUM OF HER CARREER. OVERALL I GIVE THIS ALBUM A 10/10 AND I WISH HER NEXT ALBUM IS JUST AS GOOD.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Amidst the various Best Picture Oscar contenders this year lies two hidden treasures most likely to be overlooked for the greater presence exuded by The Return of the King, Master and Commander and Seabiscuit. The two treasures are Mystic River and Lost In Translation.<br /><br />Yes, the movie may run incredibly slow at times, is seldom upbeat and even without any significant climax. Then why was this movie able to shine. It's really the good combination of good acting and directing. Hemled by second time director, Sophia Coppola (incidentally also nomianted for Best Director and Best Screenplay), she was very much able to explore and bring out the inner struggles of two helplessly souls in a foreign land. The director deliberately makes use of the slow pace to showcase the development of a great platonic friendship between the most unlikely of couples.<br /><br />The special effect here is really the superb performance by the two leads. The sweetly innocent Scarlett Johansson puts on excellent portrayal of a lost wife stuck in the monotony of a seemingly aimless marriage. Bill Murray, nomianted for a Best Actor Oscar, is convincing as a has-been actor making a quick buck in Japan trying to promote Japanese beer. Dejected and totally indifferent most of the time, his world suddenly lights up when he meets a transient soulmate. Both married to others but still can't find the fulfilment they want in life. It's ultimately about the power of silence and how greatly it wrecks relationships. It's also about how amazing relationships can develop no matter how strange the situation is or the people are.<br /><br />It's a good while since such great human drama has ben played on screens withou the need for steamy sex scenes or extreme violence. In my heart, this is already the Best Picture of 2003!
B00007E8V4|5.0|You can believe them when they say these arent b-sides just tracks that didnt make into the Toxicity album. They are truly great. They have a more refined sound then the other cds. If any of you downloaded the original versions (which is why this cd was released in the first place) you can hear the difference. There are many great songs on here, many are better then the previous albums. I feel that it is their best cd yet. Good Job Soad!
0385510438|1.0|I am a huge JOhn Grisham fan and thus I was soooo disappointed in this book. It was neither compelling nor mysterious.. The novel reads more like a memoir of life in rural Mississippi..  I had to force myself to finish.. It is not up to the quality of other books by this author.  Save your money!
B000021YQV|4.0|I feel system is on it's way to developing its new sound, like Shavo said they were trying to do. The self titled was had a harder sound, Toxicity got a more melodic feel to it, and although songs from STA didnt make the Toxicity cut, they sound even more unique. Toxicity is great for those who are in between. If you don't want hardrocking songs like P.L.U.C.K or Soil, and want more focused melodic songs like Chop Suey or Atwa then Toxcity is it. (It still has hard rocking tunes don't worry) Overall a great album. Better to come though.
B0001AP158|5.0|I believe, in the beginning it is neccessary to mention that yes,I am a Bon Jovi fan,and have been one for about 15 years now...<BR> Thus ive enjoyed all the band's incarnations,from red pixie boots to the new jersey era, both huge arena gigs and intimate settings etc .<BR> The DVD is amazing...the sound and picture are crystal clear,and with surround sound, the experience is even better..<BR>I must disagree with some of my predecesors..Jon's voice is amazing..it soars, yet draws you in with its intimacy...not surprising that during its my life,many people in the audience are sobbing...from a simple, cheery rock tune,he has turned it into a bittersweet manifesto.<BR> I also feel the need to mention that yes,Jon's voice is distorted on wanted dead or alive...but he actually is using some kind of filter[??],to make it that way and of course, during the chorus,kicks in like the Jon many are used to and who dont wish to accept the changes.<BR> To sum up...the guys are oozing charisma as always..and due to the accoustic nature of the show,we see Jon as a guy who has not only amazing stage presence but an amazing voice..not muffled by crazy guitar solos and fireworks etc etc.<BR>The dvd offers up a ton of cool additional features,and playing poker with the guys?Doesnt get better.
B0000640SA|5.0|what a movie if u dont loke this great movie theres somthing wrong with u its just pure genius loved this movie its on my top three next to the lord od the rings trilogy
B00005JN08|5.0|I loved the movie it was so awesome. I walked in the theater expecting the worse. I took my seat and right away as the opening credits came i was laughing histericaly. All through the movie i was laughing non stop. I want to say it was better than Road Trip, better than Old School.. two very enthusastic thumbs up.
0440238609|5.0|First I would like to say that these books are among the top SF or Fantasy books I've ever read! In reading some other readers reviews, I noticed the only bad reviews were the ones that were worried about the religious implications.  I am whole heartedly a christian, what these other people are forgetting is THIS IS A FANTASY STORY.  IT DOESN'T EVEN TAKE PLACE IN OUR UNIVERSE!!!  Pullman has the right to create whatever type of universe he wants. (even a hypothetical one where the Almighty ruler is not good at all)<BR>So for those of you who may be easily offended about your spiritual beliefs, remember: This book is not about OUR God, or our angels or even the Satan we are all familiar with.<BR>With that said, Pullman is what every writer should inspire to be like.  Incredibly imaginitive and willing to take risks.
0892563508|5.0|Since the beginning of the 50's, Toyota has been a making a revolution in the way corporation works. A real unique approach named lean has been allowing the company to achieve superior performance concurrently in manufacturing, product development and suppliers management. The Machine brings to the reader a wide explanation of &quot;Toyota Way&quot;. If you are looking for a book about Lean and you'd like to understand Toyota, it certainly should be your first choice!
B00005JMJ4|4.0|As good as the movie is, it almost feels like a fluke that \\"Lost in Translation\\" found so much success. Since its release, this story about a middle-aged actor and a young newlywed who form a bittersweet friendship during their stay in Tokyo, topped just about every critic's Ten Best lists for 2003; it made a pile of money; and it's been nominated for most of the major Academy Awards.<br />That's a heavy weight for a little movie to bear and \\"Lost\\" is a little movie. It's the kind of fragile, off-beat sleeper that usually falls beneath the mainstream radar: It has a slow pace, an odd structure and hardly any story at all; it's funny but not quite a comedy, sad but not quite a drama. The main characters, played by Scarlett Johansson and the recently Oscar nominated Bill Murray, are sympathetic but cold to everyone except each other, and they're both moping around a mighty fine five-star hotel.<br />So now that \\"Lost\\" has been released on DVD to a much wider audience, will it face a backlash from viewers who watch it expecting too much and wonder, \\"What's the big deal?\\"<BR> <BR>Many of the reviews here indicate a &quot;yes&quot; in answer to that question, which seems a shame because \\"Lost,\\" while not exactly your typical crowd-pleaser, is a subtle modern classic.<br />Viewers who haven't seen it but have heard the massive hype surrounding it should keep their expectations in check and focus on the movie's simple pleasures: a careful script by writer-director Sofia Coppola; beautiful cinematography by Lance Acord; and a great, Bogart-esque performance by Murray - aside from possibly (possibly) Al Pacino, I can't think of a fifty-something actor other than Murray who could pull off the character's complicated mix of humor and seriousness.  <br />I actually found that &quot;Lost&quot;, with its lonely characters and late night settings, improves on home video.  It's a movie best suited to watching alone in the wee small hours of the morning, and its ending left me feeling a nostalgia usually reserved for movies like &quot;Before Sunrise&quot; and &quot;American Graffiti.&quot;
B00005JMJ4|5.0|Lost in Translation is honestly one of the best films of 2003 and even the critics, who loved it, agree.  Its something different from the usual film.  Lost in Translation centers around lonliness, the longing to belong, and cultural differeces which can cause some problems.  Bill Murray is fantastic as the aging actor Bob Harris.  He fills the character with a charm that you cannot get enough of.  Bill Murray really does deserve the Best Actor Oscar.  Scarlett Johansson is awesome as a neglected wife who finds joy in life when she meets Bob Harris.  She really should have gotten a Best Actress or Best Supporting Actress nomination.  Last, but not least, to mention is Sofia Coppla.  As the director, she did a great job and it shows with all the hype that has surrounded the film.<br />Bob Harris WAS a movie actor.  Now as his popularity has fallen in America, he is hired in Japan, where he is still a star, to shoot commercials and photos for Suntory, a whiskey company.  He is obviously not having a good time due to frequent calls and complaints from his wife and the lack of sleep. Charolette has come to Japan with her photographer husband and spends almost all of her time in the hotel.  She is lonely from the lack of excitement around her and the neglect she gets from her husband, who cares more about his job.<br />The two meet when Charolette is dining with her husband and his actress friend who is a complete-never-stops-talking moron.  She has a brief conversation with him and we feel the warmth.  At their next meeting, she invites him to go see her Japanese friends with her.  With this experience with see how well they connect and we wish we had the same thing with someone.<br />Lost in Translation is a fantastic film that is funny and somewhat sad at the same time.  This is a great movie that everyone should see because it is so enjoyable.  Bill Murray truly rocks and is so alluring with his comidic and dramatic acting.  See this movie.
0792833236|2.0|While this movie is a true classic and is one of Scorsese's best, that can't be said for the far unacceptable DVD that is now out of print. A Special Edition w/ and Anamorphic transfer would help, but it can't come soon enough. Since the previous DVD has been out of print for quite some time, I assume a Special Edition is in the works and I expect an Anamorphic transfer. If not, I'm sure there will be more than one angry film buff. <BR>The movie is flawless as you see Jake LaMotta's soul and career being torn apart by himself through an amazing performance from Robert De Niro. A performance that I would say is the best of all-time. With the help of Jake LaMotta himself, Martin Scorsese has delievered a movie with awesome black and white cinematography, great boxing visuals (some of the most powerful you'll see in film) and top-notch performances from the entire cast. A must-see film!
B00005T30L|4.0|Although this is a good movie, it is a poor adaptation of the graphic-novel it is based on. One of the major differnces between the two is the alteration of the charectors in the movie. In the movie, Rebecca wants to move on into a new life, while Enid wants everything to stay as it is. In the novel, its just the opposite between the two. Another charector differnces is that, again, in the movie, Rebecca is thought of as the more attractive of the two, while in the book Enid is thought to be. Why the director/ writer/ or whatever made such a vast change, I dont know, but I liked Rebecca better in the movie than in the book. Now, this is a HUGE differnce. In the novel,the storys about two girls who recently graduated high-school who are having trouble keeping thier relation-ship together. In the movie, its about Enid be-freinding and cranky, 30-something yr. old man, whom she first sort-of meets when she answers an ad he wrote in the personals in the paper (a very similar adventure takes place in the book), and the major-plot from the book is only a small part of it. The only thing the director got right out of the book was the look of it. Out of the two, I liked the movie better, and I liked Rebbecas charector alot more in it, but, unfortunatly, it focuses much more on Enid...
B000002A3T|5.0|Ok, The Dark Side of the Moon is the greatest album recorded. The Wall is their most emotional work and Division Bell is Pink Floyd's most mature work. Whenever I can choose what to listen to, I'll take Division Bell. It's unusual, and only true Pink Floyd fans will know how to appreciate this.<BR>Pay attention to these songs: Great Day for Freedom, Marooned, and What Do You Want From Me?
B000002JR8|5.0|When it comes to Pantera its all about style.Along with Marilyn Manson's Smells Like Children this is 90s rock music as art. The screaming vocals,high pitched guitar,groovy riffs and a rythmic section that totally kicks this music has plenty of style.Its style over substance but its done right.So its a cool cd but not very deep.Still a must buy for any metalhead though.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|This album is a breath of fresh air amongst the manufactured pop that infiltrates our minds currently. Jet, in my opinion, are the best thing to have come from australia. Anyone that has an ear for music, and half a brain, will buy this album.
B00018D44U|4.0|I found out about Norah's new album while surfing the net one day. I waited about a month before it was finally out at the stores. The first thing that hit me about this CD was the overall colour theme - yellowish. This itself is a huge difference from Come Away With Me. <br />&quot;What Am I To You&quot; has been tastefully 'remade', as this song used to be performed accoustic-style, and only the Japanese version of Come Away With Me had this song as a bonus track. &quot;Creepin In'&quot; is good too, and Norah's and Dolly's voice blend together really well and gives us a hint as to where Norah's music might lean toward in the future. &quot;Carnival Town&quot; and &quot;Those Sweet Words&quot; give you that 'cosy' feeling you get from &quot;The Painter's Song&quot; and &quot;The Nearness of You&quot;. On that note, Norah ends this album with a 'piano-only' accompanied track which is subtle yet majestic.<br />Well, the general verdict about this CD is that Feels Like Home is definitely less sombre than Come Away With Me, although Norah appears to be in the same footsteps of her debut. It also has more uptempo songs and sounds more country. This is all good, but the reason for the 4 stars is that unlike Come Away With Me (5 stars, in my opinion), this CD lacks in outstanding songs. They don't stand out individually, but actually work together to make the album great - if you know what I mean. <br />That aside though, Feels Like Home, as an album is really good stuff - better than any other CDs released so far this year. As an album, it is very beautiful - and I must admit, while the songwriting may not be as outstanding as Come Away With Me, Norah and her band have thrown in much richer musical arrangements, which is a delight to the ears. And most importantly, Norah's voice is as good as ever.<br />You can listen to this CD over and over again. This album is a gem and deserves all the hype it gets. Don't trust your first listen. As all good music do, Feels Like Homeby Norah Jones draws you in after your third listen. No regrets.
B00005JN08|5.0|I JUST SAW EURO TRIP YESTERDAY,(OPENING DAY)WITH MY FRIEND AND WE COULDN'T STOP LAUGHING.I HAVEN'T LAUGHED THAT HARD IN A REALLY LONG TIME. IT'S ALONG THE LINES OF THOSES OTHER GREAT SEXY COMEDYS (YOU KNOW WHICH ONE IM TALKIN ABOUT). I AM NOT GOING TO GIVE AWAY ANY OF THE HILIARIOUS JOKES, BUT I ADVISE YOU TO GET TO THE NEAREST MOVIE THEATER AND SEE EURO TRIP OVER AND OVER AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00004ZAV3|2.0|I loved the Beatles...They changed my whole life....You just had too be around in 1964 to know the impact of their music on the world....I know every song and have every chord change embedded in my memory....I listened to this CD and while I was enjoying certain songs and singing along knowing that the chorus was coming in or a certain background vocal or guitar rif was was about to join in in great harmony....They didn't happen...I was aghast! ....I could hear very faint vocals way far away in the background....What happened? I thought something was wrong with my CD player so I got another copy and played it on a different CD player and heard the same mixing down mistakes....The Beatles were not there to remaster this disaster....Whole parts of songs were mixed right out into the background...a whole chorus disappeared....The harmonies that were in the original mix were not up in front like they were supposed to be.....I was very disturbed by this CD....I feel bad that young people will not be able to appreciate the original songs the way there supposed to be heard.....Some of the songs sounded like the originals but on the most part I was pained by what I heard..I would think that some of the people that work at EMI were around when the Beatles came out and would have a profound respect for the music enough not to mess around with the original mix...They obviously didn't take the time to proof read these songs....The booklet is very nice showing many different Beatle record covers....EMI you should bow your heads in shame at what you have done....
B00005ASHM|5.0|This album is not a quintessential Beach Boys product, as it's not classic 'surfing music'. And, in my opinion, it's not better than Beatles 'Rubber Soul' (who certainly was Brian Wilson's inspiration), 'Revolver' (that was released in the same year, 1966) and 'Sgt. Pepper's' (who certainly was inspired to Paul McCartney by it), as someone claims. <BR>Anyway I consider it one of the best product ever in pop/rock history. Result of a very long period of work, it's the artistic peak of Brian Wilson's mind. This collection of awesome songs was not successful as older albums, but nowadays no one could deny it's a real masterpiece. It's based on brilliant vocal harmonies (Beach Boys' trademark), good orchestration and strong melodies (although in some cases they sound little repetitive).<BR>'Wouldn't It Be Nice', 'Don't Talk (Put Your Head On My Shoulders)', 'God Only Knows' and the final 'Caroline No' are my favourite tunes (although I ask myself why the last one is so short). The instrumental tracks ('Let's Go Away For Awhile' and 'Pet Sounds') are nice but not particularly impressive. The remaining songs set the mood very well.<BR>I admit 'I'm Waiting For The Day' and 'I Know There's An Answer' sound too similar and 'I Just Wasn't Made For These Times' never impressed me that much, but this album, taken as a whole, is more than the sum of its parts. It deserves 5 stars and I suggest you to buy it. If you like Sixties approach to pop music, you won't be disappointed.
B00018D44U|2.0|I don't know what all the hype is about.  I mean she goes in one direction and stays there. The melodies sound a little too much alike (tto tranquile, boring)..I don't get it..what's all the hype about, this CD belongs in the Country genre, it's good elevator music, but trust me it will never be in full rotation on my home or car stereo system....Noarh I like you, but could you please give us other melodies, let your hair down and jam a little, geeze
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Out of like 240 reviews, only 20 people think it's less than 4 stars!  Theres a reason for that!  I first heard Gavin on the WB's One Tree Hill (a good show) and thought &quot;I have to get this CD.&quot; So I bought it and was kind of disappointed at first, since I Don't Want To Be is the most rock track on the album.  However, after several listenings I loved it!  I listen to his CD three or four times daily.  My favorite tracks have to be Belief and I Don't Want To Be, probably the two most opposite tracks on the CD.  I promise you'll be happy with the CD.
B00000IBVC|5.0|hi my friend,have you ever seen this movie?If you do not,you must to see because this movie is very good.
B000001Y79|5.0|this is the best rock cd i know of.  between just a girl, sunday morning, and don't speak there is a song for everyone!
0679428895|2.0|How is it possible for an author to take one of the most dramatic and destructive natural disasters in Western History and render it so flat and lifeless? One-dimensional characters are the problem. Harris's people have no personalities and no nuance; they wander through a book that has the formal tone and stilted style of '50s gladiator movies. The only way to read this book is on fast-forward. Or better, wait for the movie.
B00006879E|4.0|i love the CD.  the first five tracks are my favorites cus after that it gets kinda slow. but its really great.  jesse is sooo hot!
B000053VAF|5.0|at first i thought this movie was making fun of christian views but it actually is a great movie and has some many issues that they address such as god actually being a girl instead of a guy...all the actors do a great job in this movie esp. jason mewes...who i happan to be obbessed/in love with...lol...its a must see for teens like me
B00005QDW1|5.0|my favorite tracks are: in my head, making out, and platinum blonde life, but the entire cd rocks.  no doubt fans will love it!
B00006JKOL|1.0|Try singing to yourself this lyric from Requiem: &quot;Saw her face in the tear-drop black-cab window&quot;--the chords are Eb, Cm, Bb, and the &quot;melody&quot; notes are G-G-G-Ab-G-G-F-F-Eb-Eb-F--, and notice how unmusical it is.<br />How much sense does this lyric make to you? &quot;Moon jet brave beam split ceiling swerve and light/<BR>The old Valhalla.&quot;<br />And this? &quot;He polarized the pumpkin-eaters --- static-humming/Panel-beaters --- freshly day-glow'd factory cheaters (salaried and collar-scrubbing).&quot;<br />Does this feeble attempt at humor strike you as hilarious? &quot;I have no time for Time magazine or Rolling Stone.&quot;
B0001HAISG|5.0|This is a great movie for all ages!  It has all the classic themes of the book and plays them to exactness.  It is a movie that you can watch over and over agoain . A true family classic.
0345350499|5.0|Read this book.  I give it to every woman I meet if they haven't already read it.  It is the story of Arthur from a women's point of view.  It makes the story of Morgan understandable.  It is also obvious that Bradley has done her historical and mythical research.  A great story for any lover of epics and myth.
B0000047CX|5.0|This will just be a short review..this CD is absolutely wonderful. I am not going to compare it to anything...I'm not even going to try and describe it other than to say it brings me an incredible amount of joy. It's sexy cool, it's flippin' hot. <br />It's just right for a night of loving.<br />My only complaint is that it is too short...but maybe that's the genius of it because it made me crave other music by both Getz and Gilberto. <br />So I'm going to let you stop reading and let you purchase this beautiful recording.
B00012QM8G|5.0|Schindler's List is by far the most important film ever made. It's brutal, shocking and sad but it's a reality we all must face and in the end be inspired by. Oskar Schindler was a hero of epic proportion and the brave souls he rescued from certain death are a great testimony to the power of the human will and to the ultimate victory of good over evil. After seeing this movie I strongly recommend reading the book and another book called Schindler's Legacy, they too are inspiring. There's a lesson to be learned here, if only we were all a little like Schindler the world would be a far better place.
B00005JN08|5.0|This is the best comedy funny movie since Roadtrip and The American Pie Series. It's about a group is teens goinh on a cross seas trip to Europe and the hilarious things that happen to them along the way. Plus Michelle Tracthenberg from Buffy The Vampire Slayer \\" Dawn\\" plays one of the teens in the movie!!! The funniest scenes are the the ones with the old golfer guy on the plane!!!!! Almost too funny!!!!! A definite must see comedy for 2004!!! Oh and listen for this popular phrase in the moveie:<BR>\\"The Roof, The Roof, The Roof is on fire, we don't need the water...
B00018D44U|2.0|I loved Norah's debut CD. Yes, her voice was original and touching, but the material on it was OUTSTANDING! Her 2nd CD shows how emberrasing it can be to release an album with BORING, ordinary lamea** songs!! They are such uninteresting material, and a bit too country!! Some songs sound like kindergarden songs!! Not even her voice can carry this one.<BR>The production team obviously didn't want to mess with a winning formula, but why burn it to the ground?? <BR>I've read reviews about the other EP album she did with Peter Malick, which was clearly recorded before she reached stardom. I happen to like it more than this 2nd album. Check it out.
B00005JN02|5.0|I have watched this film many times. I still find new things in it. The team that made this film spent a lot of time on detail and props. I own the German DVD of this film, and it is filled with extras pertaining to the scene. I really enjoyed this DVD and am glad that it is going to be released in North America.
B0001AP12G|5.0|It's one of the best CD'S I have bought in awhile now. It's diffrent from all the suff thats out right now it actually good.Great lyrics and beats.i would recomened that you add this one to your collection.
0767817664|5.0|Fright Night, Clownhouse, Halloween, Scream, and A nightmare on Elm Street are the five greatest Horror movie ever.  Fright Night is a 1986 vampire flick written and directed by Tom Holland(Child's play).  Charlie Brewster is a high school kid who lives with his mother and has a girlfriend. He notices that his next door neighbor Jerry Dandridge is carrying a coffin into his bassment for his sleep during the day.  He gets Peter Vincent to help him out.  This movie is AWESOME. Horror Movies from the 1980's are the best(except Halloween \\"1979\\").  Chris Sarandon is great as an intimidating SCARY vampire.  i rented this movie and kept it overdue for almost a month because of repeated viewings.  Get this classic to add to your scary movie collection, it is probably better than anything that you already have!
0440237688|5.0|Imagine a world with no pain and no suffering. Imagine a world where marriage partners are selected and children are assigned to a family. Imagine a world with no color, no war, no pain, no suffering. Imagine a world with no sunshine, no snow, no hills, and no memory. Imagine a world where everyone is equal and all choices are predestined. Welcome to Jonas' world. <br />Jonas lives in the world of Sameness. Memory has been removed from the citizens to eliminate pain and suffering. Everyone in the community has a job that is assigned to them when they turn 12. Jonas, upon turning 12, was honored by being selected as the next Receiver of Memory. He begins to train with The Giver, the previous Receiver of Memory, who holds all memories of former life and soon realizes that he fails to experience not only the bad in life, but also the good. After several weeks of training, Jonas discovers a shattering secret and despite the dictated laws for his job, he plans action against the ironically corrupt system. <br />Having read \\"The Giver\\" when I was in 3rd grade, I didn't note on all the symbolism and the deeper meaning behind the book. Once I reread it, however, I was amazed. I was amazed that one author could create such a scene and predicament within one story that raises so many questions. When I finished the book the second time, I sat back for a couple minutes and simply thought, \\"Wow!\\" Even though \\"The Giver\\" reads on the level of a 3rd grader, I would recommend not picking up this book until mature themes become evident in everyday reading. <br />Overall, \\"The Giver\\" was a phenomenal book. Lois Lowry's style and diction depicts what the perfect world could be like, while throwing the ultimate question into play: would it be worth living without pain if you also had to live without joy?
