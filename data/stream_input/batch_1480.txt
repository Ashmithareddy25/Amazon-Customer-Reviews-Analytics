B0086700CM|5.0|This game has a simple premise, but its fast pace keeps things interesting. It takes some practice to get the timing of the moves just right, but then it's just a matter of playing round after addicting round. Love this game!

0062073613|5.0|The body of a young woman is found in Colonel Bantry's library. Mrs Bantry immediately sends for her friend Miss Jane Marple and the Colonel sends for the police.  It seems the victim is working temporarily at the Majestic Hotel as a dancer and has inveigled her way into the affections of one of the guests to the extent that Mr Jefferson wants to legally adopt her.<br /><br />This is of course means there are plenty of people who might have wanted Ruby dead including her fellow workers at the Majestic and Colonel Bantry's neighbours who are starting to mutter about there being `no smoke without fire'.  Can Miss Marple discover the murderer even though the police are baffled before the Colonel is completely ostracized by his friends?<br /><br />This is an intriguing mystery which will definitely keep the reader guessing right up until the end.  Of course the solution is obvious when you look back on it but at the time it seems far from clear.  This well written mystery shows Miss Marple at her best as she displays her inimitable knowledge of human nature.
B002DOSBMK|5.0|Most of the Dungeons and Dragons books, with some exceptions, are not that good.  One of the exceptions is Robert Salvatore, who is a great writer working his craft in the D & D world.  And Dritzz Do'urden is his greatest creation.  A member of a race well know for its evil, destined to be sacrificed as the third son to a Chaotic Goddess, Dritzz is destined to greater things, and to a life of service to the Gods of Good.  Salvatore takes us into Drow society, a broken thing in which power is all, and follows the upbringing of a young warrior who survives all that is thrown at him and makes his way into the light.  Exceptional character development and a great story make this introduction to the Dark Elf Series a winner in all respects.
B002R22PB6|5.0|Accolades for Alejandro Amenabar's directoral expertise and Bardem's exquisite performance in this moving story about \\"death with dignity.\\" I really don't like to watch movies where illness is central to the story, but I enjoy Javier Bardem's acting so much that I thought I'd give this movie a try.  It's a marvelous piece of work and, contrary to what I expected, the viewer does not feel confined to a sick bed.  The dialogue and scenes allow the audience lively glimpses into Ramon Sampedro's rich appreciation of life without the obstacles posed by \\"his\\" paraplegia(he does not judge others).

B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is a great book.  I've re-read it numerous times and love the story line.  The sex scenes are not the main focus - Christian Grey is a complicated character and seeing the story unfold is a real pleasure.  Get ready to read all 3 books in the series!!
B0086700CM|4.0|I think this app is really good but my only problem is it is kind of slow on the turns, jumps. and slides if you know what I mean. otherwise thanks for finally getting this app!
B0071DJZZA|5.0|I couldnt put this book down.  Although the premise of Teenagers killing each other caused a morale dilema, I was completly absorbed by this book and the other 2 books in the trilogy.  Well worth a read
B0086700CM|5.0|I never played it before and after I saw it was free I downloaded it and never had lag nor crash. So don't be hating because it is a good application.
B0086700CM|4.0|Its a really good game and its fun to compete with friends. You need quick reflexes and a good eye to play, and its really fun on a kindle fire. :D
B004JK61K0|5.0|K9 was the app I turned to after not being able to set up my personal email with the stock app on my Kindle Fire. I was so pleased how easy it took to set up multiple email accounts, especially my personal RR email account. Gmail, Yahoo, Fastmail, AOL, and Roadrunner accounts are all running fine with K9. The interface is overall easy to use, even with multiple accounts. The send button is annoying that it isn't predominant when your writing an email,  but it is there in the menu. It hasn't been a problem for me. K9 Mail app has well met my email needs and wants on my Kindle Fire. I have no desire to try other apps.
B0052VUNHC|3.0|Recently I bought a ton of cheap ebooks in search of a good read. This is the third one I've finished, and I have to say I enjoyed it the most out the three. I'm not saying it's a great book, but I don't regret spending the $2.99, unlike some of the others I've read (I'm looking at you, \\"The Marriage Bargain\\"). My biggest problem with this book was the mental  instability of the leading man, Travis.<br /><br />*spoilers below*<br /><br />One minute I was reading a kinda sweet story of a college bad boy falling in love with his close friend. Despite a not terribly original young adult plot, I found myself enjoying the story and turning the pages rather quickly.<br /><br />Halfway into the book a random Vegas plot is introduced. I was intrigued. Unfortunately this storyline was poorly developed and executed (I give the writer points for an interesting backstory though).<br /><br />Soon after the love plot fizzled (for me) and instead turned into a needy/obsessive/dependent  relationship. Our lovable bad boy (who admittedly showed violent, unhealthy tendencies all along) morphs into a psychotic, stalker-type. He tattoos Abby's name, severely beats up guys who hit on her, has major throwing/breaking things meltdowns when she leaves him (she is constantly leaving him), falls to his hands and knees on the pavement when she won't take him back. I went from rooting for their relationship to being scared as hell for her.<br /><br />He never hit her, but in real life relationships with this kind of temper tantrum/emotional abuse/controlling behavior are very unhealthy. The number of times Travis beat someone to a bloody pulp disturbed me, and I'm not talking about during his \\"fight club\\" underground gatherings. Also, Abby really started to annoy me the further I got into the book with her constantly leaving Travis and going back and forth on if she wanted to be with him.<br /><br />I'm giving 3 stars because I was really enjoying the ride in the beginning. Sadly things took acrazy turn. The biggest issue for me was that Travis's insane behavior was not really addressed or dealt with - instead it was presented as love. Travis was obviously in need of some major therapy/anger management. I wish the violence had not been glossed over and that he had sought help/therapy for his issues.<br /><br />Still, the plot did keep me fairly well entertained and it was a quick read. I liked it better than the other cheap ebooks I recently downloaded (lesson learned...when binge shopping for discount ebooks it's a good idea to read a few negative reviews first).
B0086700CM|5.0|it is the adventure u wait for in life the one u can do anything. u need this it is the most awesome game. also it is not a game it is your virtual life. go temple run.
B007NZDES0|4.0|Whenever Sade opens her mouth to sing, Gold pours out. Bring Me Home-Live is no different. BUT! Nothing in my mind will ever replace her early career songs, like my favorite- \\"The War of Hearts\\". Mrs. Adu is the queen of strong, lush, sometimes \\"haunting\\" musical arrangements and singing barefoot too :>  It works and sells, don't change that classic sound. It's a signature of pure greatness, unlike no other!
B006X5L6VS|3.0|Just like when you take a photo the long way on your phone and when you rotate the phone, the picture turns incorrectly, this app does the same thing.  On my iPhone, the app displays correctly. But not on the ASUS TF-301T.  I have to tilt my head to even read it.  Oh well! May be user error for all I know.

B0081X40HW|5.0|I rarely write reviews, but in this case--I must. I am a 50+ year old fan of music from Steely Dan to REM to The Shins, and there are very few CDs that you just step back and go -- Wow--that was Amazing. A funky, retro, swinging, jazzy, Motowny mashup of songs that you won't be able to get out of your head. Compared to Adele and Amy Winehouse, but this is Haley's distinct sound and dare I say, she is much more fun. Favorites are \\"Hit The Ground Running\\", \\"Now That You're Here\\", \\"Wonderland\\" and amazing aching ballad about lost love \\"Undone\\". (There are 4 songs not on Amazon but available elsewhere: \\"SpiderWeb\\" is a sonic blast and \\"What You Don't Know\\" is a Number 1 hit if this was 1977.) Haley, who is only 21, co-wrote every song but one--and the lyrics show that she is a very good songwriter with interesting twists about love and loss. If there is a Music God, soon, Haley will have a multi-platinum CD, be selling out big arenas, and the recipient of several Grammy awards--Best New Artist for sure.
B003Y5H5F6|1.0|Being a huge fan of the first Underworld movie, I went into Underworld: Awakening with an open mind and low expectations. I was at least excited to see the ever lovely Kate Beckinsale make a return to the series, but that was as far as my excitement developed. As said in the other reviews, the plot and effects were awful, and for the most part, the acting was subpar. As somewhat of an effects artist myself, I was sad to see a departure from the great traditional effects (designed by the awesome Patrick Tatopoulos) only approach used in the first movie, to the use of really crappy CG work (also designed by Patrick Tatopoulos). Please, either give up on making this series, or let the original group of writers write and direct the sequel (if there is one), and please let Mr. Tatopoulos use traditional effects again instead of mediocre CG. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE.
1594203334|5.0|Loved this book. There was great insight and useful information.  The French are spot on on loads of parenting issues and I found the book really helpful. Most of all though it was entertaining. Druckerman is a great writer and needs to take a stab at fiction. I think she could pull off a very funny story.
B0086700CM|5.0|Omg this is the best game I have waited so long so the kindle fire could have it my favorite game ever!!!!!!!  Love it so much!!!

B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so ,so ,so ,so ,so ,so, so, so, so, so ,so ,so,so ,so, so, so, so, so much...<br />its the best game ever!!!!!! &lt;3
B003IWRE3I|5.0|I want to start off by saying that if you read the book and didn't like it, then you will not like this movie. They stuck as close as possible to the book, leaving nothing out. The book was a slow and reflective piece, simply chronicling the journey of a father and son in a world that is dying. There was hardly any action, so if you're looking for a violent post apocalyptic movie this is not it. If you do not like slow movies, do not watch it.<br /><br />That being said, I loved this movie. I read the book, which I enjoyed thoroughly, and loved the movie for all the same reasons. The cinematography that accurately shows the dying trees, burning fields, and overall grayness of a dying Earth is perfect. Viggo Mortenson plays The Man with the effort he puts into all his movies and conveys the pain and conflict of a depressed and dying man who is only living so that his son can have a chance. And while the Boy is slightly annoying, it's understandable because he's a frightened ten year old in world of rapist cannibals. Viggo is constantly in fear of doing the most terrible thing that a father could do; killing his son to spare him the horrors of capture.<br /><br />I was worried they would interject over the top action scenes or change the plot to beef it up into a real Hollywood movie, but they didn't and stuck to the story. This story is about morality and integrity. How do you keep your morals when the whole world around you has gone insane? The Man teaches the Boy about carrying the fire; the morality and warmth of the old world, and in turn, towards the end, the Boy also shows him what it truly means to be one of the 'good guys'. Even when everyone else around you has turned towards the darker side of humanity, you can still choose to be your own person and stay true to your morals.<br /><br />If you like the book you will love this movie as it is as close to a recreation of McCarthy's story as possible. If you like slow depressing movies you will like this movie.As a lover of the book, I really do not have any criticisms. It is well made, has good acting, has a good message, and is a faithful depiction of the book.

B004FRX0MY|3.0|I buy all of my music on Amazon and I like how my music is stored in the cloud and can be accessed from anywhere.  I use the Cloud Player to listen to music on my work computer.  I also like that I can choose what to download to my phone.  This app desperately needs the ability to change the download location.  I have a Droid Razr Maxx and on some newer Android devices sdcard/ refers to internal memory and sdcard-ext/ refers to the addon SD card.  AmazonMP3 insists on downloading your music to sdcard/ and has no option to download to sdcard-ext/.  I have a 32GB microSD card that I want to download my music to, but this app has no option to do that.  Instead it downloads to the internal memory.  Amazon really needs to add the ability to change the download location of the music.  This one flaw mars an otherwise great app.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love temple run because it is cool and you r just running for ur dear life to stay alive than get eatin by these monster monkey bear explorer eating animals. so thts y I give it a 5 star vote

B007CBEO20|5.0|The raw power of Start From The Dark (2004) + the energy and modern feel of Secret Society (2006) + the classic rock vibe of Last Look At Eden (2009) + some classy blues influences = Bag of Bones (2012).  This album is really the culmination of the band's musical direction over the past decade.  Some have said this is Europe's best ever work.  I don't think it quite tops the colossal Last Look At Eden, but it's fantastic nevertheless.  I'll say it's the 2nd best album since Europe reincarnated in 2003.<br /><br />All songs are great.  \\"Not supposed to sing the blues\\" is a powerful, midtempo track that will grow on you and keep you hooked.  \\"Firebox\\" is an amazing hardcore rocker that will make you say \\"I can't believe this is the same band that made The Final Countdown\\".  \\"Drink and a smile\\" is a charming acoustic track that reminds me of Led Zeppelin's \\"Gallows Pole\\".  A welcome addition to the band's legacy.  \\"Doghouse\\" is an infectious, old-school rocker that's impossible not to love.<br /><br />I bought the Japan edition with the bonus track \\"Beautiful Disaster\\".  This is another great, up-beat, old-school rocker full of big hooks.  Definitely a stand-out song and not a typical bonus track.  Those who bought the international version are getting cheated.  If there's any justice, the song will appear as a bonus on a Best Of compilation sometime down the road.<br /><br />This is a MUST BUY for anyone who likes music with distinctive vocals, guitars, bass, and drums.  The 21st Century EUROPE has really found their niche as a modern, classic rock band.  This is not pop-metal.  THIS IS ROCK!

B007ZKY7V6|5.0|Well it's hard for serious music lovers not to  notice that pop has been slowly recovering from something of a holding patter it started to get caught in at the turn of the new millennium. This group showed up during that time actually. And they contributed something very positive too. To show the world at last that there was great musical value of the slickly produced dance/disco/house music of the late 70's to late 80's. So long as plenty of rhythmic and melodic intensity were involved. In both departments they understand the craft of it all very very well. This has the honor of being the first full lengh album of their's I've had the pleasure of hearing. And it was indeed a pleasure. The cover art of zebra's viewing themselves in a reversed,spherical mirror does reflect some of the albums themes on different levels.<br /><br />  From beginning to end this is one of those musical feast albums. \\"Baby Come Home\\" is filled with that catchy,well crafted late 70's style dance/funk-pop sound  that I've always associated with them. This sound is returned to on \\"Inevitable\\" only with some mildly more 80's production elements.  \\"Year Of Living Dangerously\\" is a 100% 1980's style midtempo pop ballad with that textured,handclap powered arrangement. \\"Keep Your Shoes\\",\\"Let's Have A Kiki\\",\\"Shady Love\\" and \\"Best In Me\\" all do something I think is wonderful. They actually strand together currently popular styles such as electropop,hip-hop and polyrhythmic afro-latin funky soul into this dizzying sound again topped off with many 80's production elements. While melodic and catchy \\"Only The Horses\\" is the only song I find musically weak here,pretty much straight forward electropop.<br /><br />  The mexican pop tyled \\"San Lus Obispo\\",the pastoral \\"The Secret Life Of Letters\\" and the 80's house revivial of \\"Somewhere\\" round out this diverse and compelling album. The lyrical themes are a modern take on the often happily decedent outlook of the disco era culture. Romance,regret,joy,indulgence and reflection all play a part in this music. Along with a much welcomed return to the art of implit social commentary now and then. Of course the \\"tipper sticker\\" adorning the front of this album is in reference to a couple of the songs mild use of profanity,used to illustrate the decedance of the characters telling the songs story. So if your a person who's never heard the Scissor Sisters before,this would likely make as good an introduction as any. And if you have heard them,this sounds like a perfectly worthy addition to their growing musical output.lgence and reflection all play a part in this music.

0545265355|5.0|So glad to own these books in hardback. They are perfect books that are appropriate for every level reader as you get as much out of them as you want to and I plan on re-reading them over the years.
0345803485|1.0|I bought the book after so many people at work were raving about it. I certainly know more about my co-workers now. YUCK! This book is terrible. The writing is horrid. I made it through the \\"magical\\" chapter 8... and deleted it off my Kindle. I am so happy to find so many others on here with similar reviews. WASTE OF TIME.
B0086700CM|5.0|omg lol this game is the best game ever it does get hard but just keep on going and you will get it down
0345529057|5.0|I didn't even know this author existed until my husband started watching the series last year. At first I didn't know if I was going to be able to stand it because of the extreme frontal nudity - I do not like porn in any fashion soft or otherwise. However, the story line won. When the series ended I couldn't wait for the next one so I ordered all five books. As an author I was blown away. Martin's ability to put the reader into the book and the face of the characters is amazing. The reader feels what the character is feeling. The reader keeps turning pages not wanting to stop. It becomes an addiction.<br /><br /> The book only adds to the series because many things had to be left out and some things the director took literary liscense with- but the books are over the top. They have opened a door of reading to me that I had closed a long time ago. That of fantasy, dragons, magic and knights.<br /><br />  Don't wait another day! Order these books they are well worth the investment.
B0060AY85C|4.0|Reviewing Toni Morrison's latest novel \\"Home\\" is a bit difficult for me, because I've never been a big fan of hers except for her novel \\"Beloved.\\"  I read it years ago and have never forgotten it.  However, with a short novel like this one, the story is told well and there is no lack of getting to know the characters.  If the book proves anything, it proves that you can go home again.  There are all kinds of homes represented in the novel, from Frank's couple of nights on ministers' couches to Lily's fine concept of what she wanted her own home to be like.  The best, though, is what Frank Money and his sister, Cee, find in returning to the tiny town that they wanted to be free of as they grew up.<br /><br />I thought that when Cee found the books on Eugenics, Morrison might have explained that in more detail.  Eugenics was in full motion much earlier in the century and this country's experiments and research with it and also Britain's played a key part in the Third Reich's adoption of such practices.  It seems odd that Cee would have allowed such surgery on herself knowing that she would be under anesthesia, but she must have had 100% trust in the doctor she worked for, and was uneducated and didn't know the meaning of Eugenics.  That the doctor took such advantage of young women like Cee is the infuriating part.<br /><br />There are certainly parallels with Frank's PTSD after returning from Korea and our veterans today who suffer the same symptoms.  Jobs are nearly as scarce today for our veterans as they were for Frank Money upon returning home from the Korean War.  It was a lovely thing to see Frank reconnect with his sister who he was so protective of and to watch what happened between the two of them as the book ended.<br /><br />I gave the book four stars because I liked it and it is deserving of more than three stars for being \\"just okay.\\"  It is definitely worth reading and since it is short in length, it only took me a few hours to read.
145162445X|5.0|After watching the \\"Something from Nothing\\" lecture about a year ago, this book intrigued me.  If you have watched Krauss' wonderful lecture, this book is a great continuation of that.  The concepts in it are basically the same, but are expanded and better explained in the book. If you haven't watched the lecture, don't worry.  The book lay's out the arguments very well without needing any prior knowledge.  It's not a very long read, and is great if you are interested at all in the universe or how the universe will end.
0345803485|2.0|I bought the entire trilogy even though I felt the publisher was gouging it's customers.  The story line was weak and predictable, not to mention full of repetitive phrases.  The plot was so pitiful despite the author's attempt to make the love scenes spicy and a bit risque.  I was deeply disappointed in the entire trilogy save the little short at the end depicting Christian's first Christmas with his \\"New\\" family.  The short was cute and made me feel for the boy.  Over 1500 pages read and to find a connection with the character only in the last few pages.  If you enjoy badly written smut then you will enjoy this story, if not I suggest you pass it by.
1439107955|5.0|I got this book out of the interest to learn more about cancer. I am not a medical<br />professional, or medical person.  This book was written for the general public, I understood greatly how it was described.  like all good books I didnt want to put it down.<br /><br />Some shocking information came when he explained some of the childhood cancers and how fast they took a childs like compaired to today.  I am greatful for what i learned.<br /><br />Everyone should read this book, learn the bio about cancer. its a great book.

B007MAETA8|1.0|This album really sucks. Big Time.<br />I considered myself a big John Mayer fan. His early stuff up to and including Continuum was phenomenal.<br />Then he started writing songs like Who Says and you could tell that puffing the magic dragon might have begun his descent into god-awful music land.<br />He doesn't seem to care (or have the concentration) to put out a decent sounding song anymore.<br />Battle Studies was mediocre and starting to sound formulaic.<br />On this album John seems to have embraced his inner pimp, starting with his dope-inspired shaggy appearance all the way to the terrible songs that fill this album. They sound nothing like his original catchy tunes.<br />It becomes difficult to listen to and mostly sounds all the same.<br />Where is stuff like Why Georgia, Neon, Slow Dancing, etc?<br />John, please put down the peace pipe and remember your lean Berkeley College days and Georgia open mike gigs where you had to have catchy songs that left an impression on people (in a good way).<br />This music is god-awful.<br />Save your money. John Mayer can do a lot better than this 70's-inspired almost-country-like twang sound.

145162445X|5.0|As usual, Krauss delivers a highly-readable book on a subject of profound importance to both scientists and non-scientists. For anyone who has ever wondered about why the universe is the way it is, this is a good starting point.
B00633W614|5.0|This second in the Clifton Chronicles series picked up right where [[ASIN:0312539568 Only Time Will Tell (The Clifton Chronicles)]] left off, which I love in a series.  There are reviews that say the story was weak and worn out, but I felt that the continuation in the story line, adding a few new characters and many new plots twists with WWII, was comfortable and maintained the intrigue and sufficiently expanded on the story line from the first book.  I'm now eagerly awaiting the third book in the series.....and beyond.
0786955554|5.0|Excellent set of tiles with a good variety of rooms and hallways. A little skimpy on \\"furniture\\" and dungeon dressing, IMO, but for the price I'm satisfied.
0300179553|5.0|I went to the Schiaparelli & Prada exhibit @ The Met, I thought it was a stunning and highly interesting exhibit. The works on view are arranged into seven themes: \\"Waist Up/Waist Down,\\" \\"Ugly Chic,\\" \\"Hard Chic,\\" \\"Naïf Chic,\\" \\"The Classical Body,\\" \\"The Exotic Body,\\" and \\"The Surreal Body.\\" As you enter there is a collection of Schiaparelli jackets that are stunning besides Prada skirts, opposite is an amazing collection of Schiaparelli hats accompanied by Prada shoes, then then you move on to a room that firt showcases \\"hard chic\\", \\"Naif Chic\\" Last is a room of mirrors.. All along are videos of Prada and an actress who plays  Schiaparelli talking, you really get a feel and understand these two great women.<br />The book is $50 @ The Met, it is a real bargain on here. The book is a must have for anyone who enjoyed the exhibit, it is beautifully and artistically done.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! User friendly. I have this app on my iphone too. I love the reading plans and having all the versions.
B0086700CM|5.0|if u rated this a 1 star u are so weird and stuiped u are so mean. THIS IS THE BEST APP &lt;3
B007RRFUHM|4.0|I have to agree with the first reviewer.  Kimbra has amazing talent, and the songs on this album are good.  But it is nothing compared to what she can do live!  I feel like this album is a really watered down version of her true talent. The production does not do her justice, and I think it would be at least a bit of a let down to those who listen to her live recordings. If you have not heard the live versions, you are missing something truly special.<br /><br />If you would like to hear the full range of her voice and talent, go to You Tube.  My favorite is her cover of Two Weeks (Grizzly Bear) mashed up with Head Over Heels (Tears For Fears).  It is more than worth time to find it and give it a listen.  Others to hear - Settle Down live at the Spotify house (IMO, the best live version of the song as she performs by herself. Her skills creating the music solo are amazing), her cover of Love Bomb, and all the Sing Sing videos.
B0059XTV4Y|2.0|I would have liked the movie without the story of Wally from 1998.  This movie reminds me so much of Ararat by Atom Egoyan, The way it is told from modern day then goes back in time and focuses on an art auction/gallery. Hmmm, wonder if Alek Keshishian saw that. It was boring!
B008458O3S|4.0|I have been waiting for literally years for this game to come to Android!  On iOS it was great and kept getting better with the addition of user created trainyards and all.  The android version is no disappointment and on an aging Nexus S it runs smoothly.  Hopefully the Android version will be updated to include the user created puzzles eventually.  Once it gets user created puzzles, I will update this review to 5 stars!  I strongly encourage puzzle fans to try this game out.  One thing to note, though, is that some people seem to be having difficulty getting this working on Kindle Fires.  I sure hope it's updated to work, but in the mean time beware!
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally they have Temple Run. I have been waiting so long for it to come out on kindle fire. GREAT GAME!
0785152458|5.0|Just got it in the mail today and read it. It was all kinds of awesome. One question about the last page of the hard cover... it has a \\"reading order\\" of Kick Ass books, #1 is a pic for the KICK ASS hardcover labeled Part One; #2 is a pic of a HIT GIRL hardcover labeled Part Two; #3 is a pic of KICK ASS 2 labeled Part Three. I did a little looking and i don't think there is a HIT GIRL book... some clarity on this would be nice if anyone has an answer. Thanks

1609613937|5.0|I absolutely loved The Starch Solution! I have to admit that I did not have high expectations, as I thought the book would simply be old newsletters rehashed and combined into book-form and that I would find it repetitive. However, while there was familiarity I was so impressed with the way in which Dr McD and his editors summarized the old materials/newsletters in such a concise manner. The book was a fast and easy read yet I did not feel that it was dumbed down at all.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I really like this game. I can waste time without feeling like I'm just wasting time because I have to think. It is challenging but not so hard that it's frustrating. Buy this game.
0385344228|5.0|I know this is a novel, but can you imagine any family living through this experience? The ending was so different from what I expected. Makes you wonder if you were Jacob's parent how you would feel. The author did a great job of keeping a person's attention and to the detail of everything that happened - right to the end.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is the best ever.  there is a huge variety of games so its meant for everyone. i recomend this app!!!!!!!!!!!  GET IT!!!!!!!!!!
B005OTGS4E|4.0|I can't say there was any new story to tell in this variation of \\"Where Eagles Dare\\" but it was quick paced and well acted. In brief, soldiers go behind enemy lines on a mission, run into trouble and have to fight their way back out. If i have a complaint, it's that the resolution of the film is rather quick. I was engaged enough to want a little more.
B0086700CM|5.0|truely, this is one of the best games ive ever played. ive played it on opossum and was so excited when it hit the amezon market.

B00337KM2S|5.0|\\"Up in the Air\\" is a comedy-drama film that follows the work of Ryan Bingham (George Clooney) who informs workers all over America that they are laid off.<br /><br />Bingham does the dirty work for restructuring businesses as an employee of an independent company Career Transitions Corporation (CTC). His life of travel and shallow living hits a snag though when he is teamed up with fresh faced Natalie Keener (Anna Kendrick) who is looking at ways to reduce travel costs for CTC, but life on the road is where Bingham feels in his element.<br /><br />For years Bingham has used smooth talk and insincere advice to comfort those that he has fired, yet spending time with Keener, developing a relationship with a fellow work travel junky he comes across, and the marriage of his younger sister combine to undo his world of ostentation.<br /><br />The film narrative covers many themes such as selfishness, workplace cold heartedness, and reflecting on social attitudes that for a long time provided Bingham with comfort but are exposed to be flawed life compasses.<br /><br />It is a movie that viewers will be able to relate to in their own ways with an assorted storyline that is at times saddening, often humorous, and philosophically informative.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
0307592731|4.0|I was immediately drawn to the concept of Cheryl Strayed's memoir \\"Wild\\". I feel that many of us have woken up in our mid-twenties and realized that we want to run away from our post-adolescent malaise and the less than stellar choices we've made. We look around, see how we've treated ourselves and others and want to high-tail it out of there. However, Strayed is unique in that most of us do not choose to exorcise our demons by hiking the Pacific Crest Trail.<br /><br />At twenty-six, still reeling from the sudden death of her mother four years earlier, in the aftershocks of a divorce to a man she still loves, and dealing with the consequences of years of poor decision-making, Cheryl Strayed decides on a whim to hike 1,100 miles of the Pacific Crest Trail with no hiking experience whatsoever. The Pacific Crest Trail, which starts in Mexico, zigzags through California, Oregon, Washington, and into Canada, spanning 2,650 miles.<br /><br />While I was interested in this book, I was also skeptical. It has all of the makings of an instant bestseller. So it could be amazing. It could also be amazingly over-hyped. Fortunately, Strayed is a gifted storyteller: weaving together her adventure on the trail and the experiences that led her there with humor and aching honesty.<br /><br />May has been the Month of Memoirs (I am using an overly generous definition, including biographies as well). Most of the books I've read this month tell the story of someone who has achieved something despite staggering odds: whether it's escaping from a concentration or POW camp, getting a college education after years as a child soldier, living with parents with mental illness, or surviving the Titanic shipwreck. One of the things I loved about Strayed's book is that it is one of redemption. She is a self-sabotaging wreck. She is attempting, in her words, to change: \\"Not into a different person, but back to the person I used to be- strong and responsible, clear-eyed and driven, ethical and good\\".<br /><br />And, like any fundamental and true change, this one takes time.<br /><br />And, like every change that restores someone back to the person they were before tragedy knocked them profoundly off-balance, this one is worth it.
B002VECM6S|5.0|I own this DVD and am glad for the opportunity to review it. I think this movie was very well acted and presented. I also found a deeper side to Sandy Bullock to be well acted and a great side to her persona. The story has so much heart that it even allowed my husband to enjoy sitting with me. A must watch.
B003Y5H574|1.0|Rarely does a movie so obliterate the basic principles guiding healthy human relationships.  How can we maximize our selfishness in the name of love?  How can we justify adultery, womanizing, emotional manipulation and paedophilia?  Crazy, Stupid, Love offers a formula pulled from the modern equivalent of a medieval dungeon: one part soul-mate mythology, two parts self-actualization, one part pro-business motivational philosophy, one part preternaturally gifted children who offer sage advice, three parts orgasm-turned-religion.<br /><br />For what it's worth, my wife and I have maintained a happy marriage for the past decade by doing the very opposite of everything promoted by this film.
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|\\"Sigh No More\\" is the very first track and if you give it a listen, then you will have a good understanding of all the music. The music was soothing, well played and wonderfully presented. I was carried away by the entire album. I hope you enjoy this as much as I.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|I love nothing more in life than a good read, which is exactly what Jamie McGuire managed with this book. This book most certainly deserves the five star ratings.
B000002UJQ|5.0|It's one of these great Radiohead albums and the best ! I like it. Paranoid Android is my favourite song ...
B003F3NEBG|5.0|I went back and watched this movie on VHS, wow what a difference. The blu-ray version definitely the better choice. If anyone is debating over which one to get. Blu-ray is the way to go.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app soooooo much! and whoever said the whole reveiw about this refering to politics.....grow up dude! its just a game!! if u don't like it...... don't get it!! but temple run is the most amazing game out there!
0345803485|2.0|I heard everyone talking about this book and decided to read it.  Several reviewers have referred to Christian Grey as an alpha-male.  Based on the description in the book, he is not what I would consider an alpha-male.  He is unsure about himself due to past trauma...he is scarred both inside and out.  But he is not an alpha-male. He is arrogant and a spoiled brat...but then so is Ana. Ana...I wanted to slap.  I understand being slightly indecisive, but, come on...make up your mind either like him or don't.  In short she is like many other female 20-somethings I know.  The author needs to invest in a thesaurus. If some of my high school students turned papers using multiple repetitive words like Ms. James does, I would fail them.  As several other reviewers have noted, there are multiple used of \\"oh (fill in finish here)\\", or she blushed, turned red, crimson, any other variant of red. And if I had to read the term \\"inner goddess\\" one more time, I would have screamed.  At one point, it was used 3 times on one page!  I understand that a lot of this was new to Ana...she was a virgin.  But I am sorry, I cannot picture a 22 year old being a naive as she was. Obviously, Ms. James has not been around this age group....I can assure you they are quite informed about matters of sex virgins or not. Additionally, do we REALLY need the scene where they decided to have sex while she is on her period???????  The BDSM did not bother me nearly as much as that scene did.<br /><br />The 2 stars are just because I couldn't give it 1.5.  The premise behind the story was interesting.  It just needs some MAJOR tweaking.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Enjoyable fun and entertaining. Is as promised. But still not sure how some people score real high. Addictive game. Everyone should try this one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Must be able to handle reading somewhat soft core porn but definitely worth the read just to get to the other 3 books in the series.

B003YL4LYI|4.0|Martin resolves a few of the frustrations that occurred in book four. Danerys is finally becomes interesting again after a solid start in book one. However, there are only two chapters dedicated to Bran whose story finally started to pick up in book four.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed these books.  I had thought that they would be to violent for my taste, so I held back on reading them.  I was supprised at how the author managed to tone down the violent actions and still made you think about how we as humans could behave so inhumanely.
B0086700CM|5.0|Definitely in my top 5 apps. A must have! Along with draw something and angry birds. I LOVE TEMPLE RUN!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I was playing this game on my friends phone than I went straight to my kindle and yelled &quot; what is it called again.&quot;
0345803493|5.0|I am not a reader and haven't read a book in over 30 years.  With all the attention this Trilogy was getting I thought I better read it so that I wouldn't be out of the loop.  When I got it in the mail I started reading it right away and  I couldn't put the book down.  As soon as one book was read, I immediately started the next.  I was sad when I finished the book because it was over.  I wanted more.  I found the book easy to read and as I said it kept my interest throughout the whole story.  I have recommended FIFTY SHADES to several of my friends and neighbors.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is really awesome and I think  I could play it forever because it is so addicting. a great app
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The book(s) sounded interesting and the price was right so I took a chance. Turned out to be my lucky day. A great read. Great characters and a well crafted story. Buy it. You'll enjoy reading it.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|fun but takes a while to earn extra money. all the quest take all your money so you get behind on them n there shouldn't be quest to buy things that cost acorns one last thing game is small amounts of coins never acorn or the special prizes
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Book is well written and based on actual facts and references.  Provides a side of President's and former Presidents that is not seen by the public, but it's a side that shows the ability to overcome politics and to make decisions that are the best for the country.

B007L3BMGA|1.0|I am not kidding- this was rubbish. There was nothing redeeming about this! THe characters are unbelievable and undeveloped, it reads like an adolescent fantasy, and the so-called romance is so tedious I only finished it to say- save your money! It just doesn't get better at all.
B0086700CM|5.0|It's so much fun! I heard about it but never knew how fun it really is.I love it.Get it!!! NOW!!!!!!
B007BZM30M|4.0|If you're a generic hater of pop music, you will hate this song.<br /><br />It's a typical fun pop song that makes you tap your toes and gets stuck in your head. I like mindless pop music to help pass the time sometimes (there's pretty much no type of music I don't listen to, ranging from rock to country to opera to big band/swing to hip hop, etc.) It's not the greatest song ever written, but it accomplishes what it intends to do. It's not meant to be some meaning-filled soulful song. It's a pop hit that makes you sing along with catchy lyrics and sway to a catchy beat. In that, it accomplishes what it's meant to do.
B007P3TMW2|1.0|This is one of those movies that sounded good, even from the preview trailer, but was way too long for me and my family.  I rented it thinking that Tom Hanks and Sandra Bullock are two talented actors who would be fun to watch.  They do a few emotional scenes very well, but the movie itself is a design mistake.<br /><br />Perhaps you could you sum up the message of some post-modern works as \\"there is no truth, meaning or purpose to life so just deal with it.  The only thing we have in this meaningless universe are the relationships we have with each other.\\"  The boy's key was not important even though the boy wanted it to be something significant.  The search for knowledge makes you a better person, even if you know there is no hope of finding anything.  The father wanted his son to search for the sixth borough of New York even though he knew it never existed.  The boy would pick up some interesting trivia and talk to people along the way.  The old man knew that the search for the key's purpose was hopeless but went along for the ride anyway.  The encouraging message his father circled in a newspaper was a meaningless mistake from ink bleeding through the paper.  There is no reason to explain why terrorists would want to blow up a tower.  Nobody has answers to explain the world because there aren't any.  Anyone who claims to know is deceived or lying to you.  \\"We know that there is no way to know anything with certainty.\\"<br /><br />This is a hopeless and dark way to live.  It also makes a painful 2 hours and 10 minutes to watch.  I might have given it two stars had the movie been shorter.  Please give me my money back for movie malpractice.<br /><br />If you liked the Tree of Life, you might light this one.  I only could tolerate the Tree of Life for 30 minutes.
B0052REUW0|3.0|The author argues that violence in society has declined, and is now at a historically low point. Not only should violence have declined in statistical numbers, but more significantly the cultural and social acceptance of violence has been virtually eliminated. Modern society doesn't accept violence deemed just or even proper only half a century ago.<br /><br />I guess my reaction to this book is a case in point, since I have been unable to finish reading it. I simply couldn't stomach the introductory descriptions of the casual violence prevalent in historical and primitive societies, and even among our primate cousins.<br /><br />I'm thus unable to review the book fully, but what little I read was enough to make me believe it. Hats off to the author.<br /><br />Please note that the descriptions of violence are neither graphic nor especially detailed. There's a lot of fiction much more gruesome, but if you, like me, never watch or read horror stories, you should perhaps not satisfy your curiosity, even if you, like me, are very interested in the history of man.

B003ZSJ212|4.0|I was once one of those kids who lived and breathed Star Wars.  I read the books and Star Wars Insider, collected the awesome toys (especially the action fleet sets), played the video games and played Decipher's CCG (oh, the memories!), and of course I watched the movies.  My brothers and I studied the Star Wars encyclopedia and essential guides, and spent most of our outside time having lightsaber fights.  This is just a glimpse of our severe nerdom...and the reason why we never had any friends until high school :)<br /><br />Although the THX VHS tapes were most commonly in circulation during my childhood, I really grew up with the Special Edition versions, and these were what I knew best.  As a result, I was used to the changes: expanded CGI sets were the norm, I liked the new Sarlacc and the Death Star explosion rings, and I never even knew that \\"Han shot first\\" was a debate.  When I saw the 2004 DVDs, I was mesmerized by how fresh the movies looked.  Many of the scenes were tremendously cleaned up (Jundland Waste at sunset), but most fans focus on the negative changes.  The new Anakin at the end of RotJ was a bit shocking, but I actually didn't care, just like Vader's \\"nooo\\" at the end of the Blu-ray release didn't bother me.<br /><br />So why am I not the same fanboy I used to be?  Why did I never become a so-called purist?  Did I just give up on caring for a beloved part of my childhood?  Why will the Blu-ray release be the version that I show my son when he is a little older?<br /><br />I grew up, got married, had a kid, etc.  I am an adult!  People, all the magic and wonder is still in Star Wars, despite the differences.  There are much bigger things to worry about (in life) than R2-D2 hiding behind disappearing rocks, blinking ewoks, a re-vamped Max Rebo Band, and perhaps the worst love story of all time in AotC.  The movies are fun, but they are not life.  If you want the originals, buy a VHS or laser disc player and then buy older editions of the movies.The Blu-rays looks great, and that is the primary reason to buy Blu-rays, right?  Over half the reviews are one star - one star!  Sure, I would like Lucas to release the originals on Blu-ray, but come on Star Wars fans, and get a life!
B007R6X9IK|5.0|I just purchased the album and played it at least four times finding new turns and surprising twists every time. As a DM fan, I have to say that this album is outstanding and extremely well made. I think all parties involved gave it their all to make it sound so beautiful and touching. What a joy! David did it again!His vocals are superb.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I haven't been a Woody Allen fan for about 45 years.  Loved his early standup routines but his movies left me cold - until now.  Midnight in Paris is a gem.  A great time travel movie with humor and charm.
B0086700CM|5.0|The classic temple run. A well put together game that deserves to be free :) The graphics are good and the gameplay is smooth.
B0047A72E6|5.0|A fiery, passionate performance from a man truly \\"74 Years Young.\\" Buddy's personality shows through on every track.  He wails on his guitar with ferocity in the first track and definitely gets the listener's attention. There are plenty of scorchers to follow. His vocal chops are still well intact. His wry humor really shines through on \\"Key Don't Fit\\" \\"Let the Door Knob Hit Ya\\" and \\"Guess What.\\"  \\"Stay Around a Little Longer\\" with BB King and \\"Everybody's Got to Go\\" are truly touching. This album demonstrates why Buddy is one of the most influential blues artists. The songs are autobiographical and indicative of a man looking back on his life, however hearing the vitality and gusto of this recording it's apparent that it's not the last chapter.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is so addicting. There is no reason why someone should not get this game. If you don't believe me you'll just have to play the game yourself.

B003Y3IKSE|1.0|My daughter ordered these same sandals and loved them.  She raved about how comfortable they were.  I then ordered a pair for myself.  The first time I wore them the edge of  the long vertical strap that goes up the front wore away the skin below my big toes, causing me to bleed profusely.  When I looked down at my feet, I was shocked to see all the blood.  By the next day, the skin had scabbed over, leaving ugly marks on my feet.  I immediately returned them with no hassle from the conpany.

0345803485|3.0|I can see why this book is getting the hype. It is erotic and forbidden but female friendly with the troubled flawed hero, and quite the extended Penthouse forum fantasy. It's a very easy read, and doesn't take long to get to the sexy parts.<br /><br />But it's also an annoying read for people who appreciate at least passable fiction writing. It feels as if the author wrote it in a day and a half, sans Thesaurus and Google Maps. There is Christian Grey, the 26 year old self-made billionaire Renaissance Man. How do you become a billionaire at 26 when you don't work, you don't inherit, and you're only  alleged employable skill is \\"reading people?\\" That's only one of problems with one character. It's nearly as implausible, and frankly unnecessary to make this otherwise, curious, adventurous and worldly young lady a virgin, and that much more unbelievable since she is so hypercharged sexually by mere words, and brushes of the fingers. She never eats but she drinks a fair amount and all kinds of cute normal guys want to date her.<br /><br />Little details that an editor or the author herself could have remedied with five minutes of research also detract. Ana lives in Portland on the western side of Oregon while she attends Washington State University which is located in the remote eastern part of Washington state. Why not have her go to a school in or around Portland then?<br /><br />The writer's insistence on having this girl bite her lip every two pages which provokes some sort of sexual response in Grey which he must articulate every time she does it which is every 5 minutes, gets' very tiresome. So do Christian's grey hooded eyes and long fingers and the fact that there is apparently nothing he's not an expert on.<br /><br />It gets three stars because it is pure trashy mindless, predictable fantasy. If you completely suspend belief and taste for good writing, it's kind of fun. But don't expect anything approaching literature.

B0086700CM|1.0|I really love this game. But on a Kindle Fire it laggs. The guy runs off the ruins on its own. I can hardly make it past the 125k mark like people said. My sister has an Ipad and it works much better. This game is made for apple devices.  I was so excited to play this but it started lagging and everything! I suggest you not get this unless you have an apple device.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I am an avid reader, having read probably 50 book this year alone. I read mosty romance books unless something really catches my interest. I have to say this trilogy is the most interesting books I have read in a LONG time. I read all 3 in 1 week. I loved the characters. Was this book a little naughty?? YES YES YES but the love story behind the sex is what kept me interested. I really hope Mrs. James writes this story from Christan's point of view. I so want to know what he was thinking. Since reading these books I have yet to find another that has truly kept me interested. These are a must read!!!!!!

0399226907|5.0|Eric Carle is truely one of the most fascinating illustrators i have ever read from. His artful illustrations are truely his own unique style and separate him from others. And when you hear his name, there's one book that i'm pretty sure all people have heard: \\"The Very Hungry Caterpillar\\".<br />In the book, we see a newly-hatched caterpillar on a Sunday morning, who is as hungry as a horse. On Monday, he eats through an apple. On Tuesday, he eats through two pears. On Wednesday, he eats through three plums. On Thursday, he eats through four strawberries. On Friday, he eats through five oranges. But on Saturday, when he has a giant picnic feast, he gets more than a hunger pain.<br />No matter what, this has been one of the first books we all read as toddlers. They will love its artful looks, the holes in the books, and the early lessons. They'll learn the days of a whole week, counting from 1-5, and how to eat healthy and not eat too much unhealthy food. But as i see it now, it is still a book i'll always remember reading as a toddler.<br /><br />(Grade: A)
0920236162|3.0|After reading many of the 5 star reviews, I happily purchased this book.  I just read it to my 2 and 9 year old daughters today without reading it myself first....and I got a little leery about their reactions.  They became really concerned as this story progressed.  First, the actions are sudden and the moral of the story is not clearly understood but rather it left my girls feeling confused and I had to explain the point.  Both of my girls were concerned about the forests repeatedly being burnt and took it to heart because the princess tells the dragon to blow the fire. I think the message is great for girls but it just isn't delivered properly because all the terrible chaos overshadows the point, which is sudden.  If you decide to buy the book, read it first, and be prepared to do some explaining if you haven't gone over this concept before (acceptance, loss of the \\"happy ending\\" but also, oddly not really the loss of the happy ending!).  It won't leave the good feeling with your kids like it might be intended to do when you think about the real point of the story.
B005NPLXJ4|1.0|See the review \\"Crazy Deaf Grandpa talking over \\"Music\\"\\" - that sums it up very well.<br />If you like William Shatner's music, then you might like this album.  Otherwise, stay clear.<br />The only redeeming vocal bit is the few tracks where some of the Metallica folks sing backup.  Metallica is as good as ever and the guitar and drum parts will remind you of the Black Album.  If only there was a way to remove the vocal tracks...

B002UBRFDC|5.0|I read \\"SHOGUN\\" for the first time 30 years ago.  I couldn't put it down then (my family became used to my absences), and I am looking forward to purchasing and reading this book again, adding it to my home library collection. The previous reviews here say it all.....don't miss it!
0307594009|4.0|I wanted to the read the autobiography by Anne Frank because she was similar to my age. She went through such a crazy war, debatably one of the worst wars in history. Her love and kindness lived throughout the novel and it really enticed me to read the book from reading the reviews that were written about Anne. I wanted to read it most importantly because she went through the Holocaust.<br /><br />I'll say the book was written in teenage language, simple, and understandable. This book is a great demonstration of love and kindness. One of the most evident themes is \\"love and kindness lived through the vile lack of humanity.\\" In Anne's diary she never had hatred for anyone; for example she said; \\"why can't people live together peacefully.\\" She was a loving girl and tried understanding everyone's point of view. This demonstrates  the theme because Anne's love didn't get crushed through the harsh demonstration of vile humanity through the war. In conclusion I believe love and kindness can live as long as lack of humanity doesn't get to your head and change the way you live. If you allow it to get to you, you would just become just like the vileness of this humanity. There was this review that said, \\"Anne is just a weak little girl that knew she was going to die.\\" I strongly disagree because she tried her best to stay alive, and even if she knew that she was going to die, she made the most of her life and it didn't affect the way of her living.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who's going through a hard time and use Anne's life as a guide. She shows she can stay happy even if she's going through all these hard times. She's a great role model for people who don't believe in themselves. She talks a lot about animals and was kind to everyone and tried to understand everyone. To conclude, this is a good book to read if you want to have an inside scoop on the way Jews had to live in Europe during WWII.<br /><br />TJHS 11th grade student

0345803485|5.0|The novels are great in paperback.  When I found out that they were being released in paperback, I had to get my own copies.  The hardback book versions are very expensive, whether on Amazon or eBay or other places.  You are better off to get the paperback versions at a much lower price than hardback.  Also, the kindle versions leave some pages out of all of the books, and the paperback versions are over 500 pages long in print.<br /><br />EJ has done it to perfection and made BDSM into a whole new realm of excitement in the bedroom as well.  If you have a boyfriend or husband, this is definitely the trilogy of books to talk about.<br /><br />Kudos to EJ!  Great books that I will have a chance to re-read again this summer.<br /><br />Can't wait for more books by EJ.

0345803485|1.0|This so-called erotica is an extremely poor attempt.  I gave this book a try because of all the media rage and I am now in a rage.  Story of O mutilated!  I was bored, then I got to the sexuality and was even more disappointed.  I am neither a prude or a pervert but this is a colossal rip-off.  To say that it is on the bedside table of every woman is more media hype.  I finished it for spite and want my money back.  It is an insult
B0086700CM|5.0|its so fun I love it my grandaugter loved it so much. I will keep playing it till I get
1577314808|5.0|Firstly, I would like to say that if you were to purchase The Power of Now, I would recommend buying the audio, and not the book. It is a lot easier to understand if you hear the author talk about it, rather than if you try to read it and to make sense of it, even though the audio and the book are of the same content.<br /><br />Next, I would like to say that this book is not for everyone. When I first started listening to it, some of the things the author talked about rung true with me because of things that had happened to me in my life, while other things I looked at with extreme skepticism and ridicule to the point where I discarded these teachings as nonsense. If you have never studied anything spiritual, and have never had any first had experiences with such issues, then you will have a hard time understanding what the author is talking about.<br /><br />That said, I have concluded from connecting the ideas in this book to those from a variety of other books, and from my own personal experiences, that what the author is speaking of is certainly true. There are many reviewers who claim Eckhart Tolle is a thief and a fraud because he keeps repeating the same idea over again and because there is nothing in this book which can't be found anywhere else. It is true that there is nothing new here, but he openly admits it in the book. He says that this book is the one true spiritual teaching which can be found in all the world's religions. Yes, with all the hate and strife that religion is causing us, it is difficult to believe that all the world's religions contain the same message of love. I had a hard time believing it myself, but it is the truth. What the author has done is he has collected the esoteric teachings and put them in words which the layman could understand, so instead of reading the ancient Hindu and Buddhist texts which are rife with symbolism, you can read this book where all the symbols are deciphered.<br /><br />You might not be ready to read this book today. You might not be ready to read it in a year, but there will come a day when you are ready to take in what the author has to say and you will know the truth without a doubt.<br /><br />(ADDED CONTENT BELOW MONTHS AFTER WRITING ORIGINAL REVIEW)<br /><br />There is one thing I would like to advise people new to the subject of Eastern practices. You may get the impression from this and many similar books that life is meaningless, bleak, and that the only way to be happy is to lose any amibition you have to accomplish anything. This is not the case, and you will only see this when you've immersed yourself with this practice and developed a higher level of mental ability. Once you're there, you will be able to accomplish whatever you want because you are no longer afraid of failing. You won't get upset when you strum the wrong string; on the contrary, you will embrace the mistakes and realize that they are all part of the learning experience of life.<br /><br />I used to be very driven when I was younger, but when I started getting involved in Eastern spirituality, I lost most of my fire because I realized that my life would ultimately end. It's one thing to think about it, but when you realize it deeply, it shakes you to the core. I no longer strived to reach the heights of the world because I didn't feel there was a point. However, slowly but surely, the drive that once characterized my personality returned with avengence, and I have become more ambitious than I have ever been. I am in the constant process of improving myself through reading (non-fiction, vocabulary building, writing style, self improvement), meditating, lifting heavy weights, stretching, and I've taken up guitar playing. I want to become the best at it, but I am doing it for myself. I am no longer driven by an obsessive need to be seen as the best by others, the need that subtly haunted me during my basketball days.<br /><br />My main advice to you is to be patient with this practice. Theremay be a hopeless transition period where you are breaking down the barriers of sludge that have cut you off from who you were always supposed to be, but once they are down, it be more than worthwhile.may be a hopeless transition period where you are breaking down the barriers of sludge that have cut you off from who you were always supposed to be, but once they are down, it be more than worthwhile.

0307352145|4.0|What an enjoyable read.  I admit that when I ordered this book, I didn't think that I was going to like it very much.  I thought that it would be a very dry and academic study.  Wow, was I surprised by the content of this book.<br /><br />\\"Quiet\\" gives numerous examples of how the U.S. came to prize extroverts.  Ms. Cain illuminates the transition from honoring the quiet, wise elder to idolizing the all American Ken doll ideal.  She pointed out things that I had noticed but never put much thought into connecting.  Such as, the people that we, as a society, hold up as \\"pillars\\" are those that enjoy being in the spotlight, those that enjoy speaking out, or those that can deliver a message the best.  They are not those that may have the best idea or those that can relate to a person on an individual basis.<br /><br />Another aspect of this book that I really enjoyed was the empowerment I felt when reading it.  I found myself saying, \\"that's what I do.\\" or  \\"I always feel that way.\\"  It made me understand that I wasn't being anti-social or mean because I needed quiet time.  I felt that all the things that I thought made me weird or different than everyone, was really me just being an introvert.  That the idea of everyone being a social butterfly was skewed.  I had fallen prey to the marketing of the extrovert as an ideal!<br /><br />For all those closet introverts out there, I would highly recommend this book.  For those of you with children that seem withdrawn and you just don't get it, run out and buy this book!<br /><br />I was given this book by the publisher for the purpose of review.  All opinions are my own and not influenced by the publisher.

0740748475|4.0|I was only 6 when the strip ended. I never knew of its existence until walking into a Waldenbooks at my mall in the early 2000s. I wanted a Peanuts or Garfield book but they were too much money. I found in the sales section a couple of C&H compilation books that ran between $5 and $10 dollars. It was through that I became hooked.<br /><br />I got this complete collection a few months back and enjoy it immensely. I am glad this comes in a set of 3 books all sold together as opposed to Bloom County a strip that ran for 1 year less than C&H but took 5 books to complete and each book retails at $40. It would be nice if C&H came in a set of 5 simply because it would make it easier to handle, but then that only gives Andrews McMeel the chance to charge more for each book individually.<br /><br />The books are organized by date, although some are out of order, not sure if this was an accident or not.<br /><br />My biggest complaint is that these are rather heavy books to handle but they are well worth buying nonetheless.
B004EPYZV2|5.0|ghost protocol not only ties in characters from previous movies, but also keeps you believing that Ethan Hunt is still the man for the job. Simon Pegg as usual delivers quality lines in terms of humor, but also feels like he belongs as a part of the team. the newcomers are given some back story to fill out their characters, so you care for them too. action sequences are just as you expect for an MI flick, so you won't be disappointed.
B004SEUJYG|4.0|Each time I see the film I see it a little bit differently.  From the movie theater, to small tube TVs with over the air service of the past, to a 60\\" TV on blu-ray.  It is well made and one of the timeless films that will be in reruns for decades into the future.  The blu-ray picture was very good, the sound was fine in surround, the book portion was okay, and for $10 it was a good value.
B005PTYOTE|5.0|like the title says, amazing quality and great special features. purchased after buying ghost protocol on blu-ray, but already owned on standard def from iTunes... much better now that it's all in hi-def!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|A high school sophomore could write this drivel. The author makes sex and eroticism as boring as mowing lawns. The only reason I can imagine why so many are reading this is that with a Kindle or an iPod you can do so in anonymity. lt took endless days to finish this because it is so dull and banal. There simply nothing in it to recommend.
B007RRFUHM|4.0|I really enjoy the clarity, control and beauty of this young woman's voice!  Her soul comes through in every song and the instrumentals add even more depth. Would love to hear Kimbra in  concert someday as she is one of the few musicians who sound even better live(youtube videos).<br />In my opinion, though, a better job could have been done with the cardboard case in which the CD was contained.  It was extremely difficult to remove the CD from the case and I came close to breaking the CD in the attempt.  I transferred the CD and booklet to a spare plastic case to avoid the possibility of breakage in the future(saved the original cardboard case as I like the artwork).

0399159029|4.0|This novel fills in some gaps in Gunther's history and shows, once again, what a romantic he is, under his world-weary policeman's cynicism.  It describes the sad state of the Berlin police force during the war and the negative effect of the conflict on Berlin itself, at a time when it seemed to the world that the Reich was winning.  The book highlights the Chech resistence, both in and out of Germany, and wraps up Gunther's Heydrich connection. Finally, it is an Agatha Christie meets Bernie Gunther mystery. Prague Fatale is not the best of the series, but it presents a more appealing version of our hero than a late-middle-aged Bernie reduced to hanging out in Cuban brothels.  I don't know if any future books will have to follow this pure flashback format or the combination present/flashback premise of other volumes.  But the series still has life in it.
B0084P9202|2.0|There is something 'awe inspiring' and 'jaw dropping' and beautiful when Sigur Ros marries 'sound' with 'propulsion'. Their music can 'bring back' the impactful moments of my life, make me smile, etc. Examples of this (to me) are the first 2/3 of album 'Med ... Endalaust' and almost all of live album 'Inni'. Sigur's song 'Festival' (even with its slow start) from album 'Med ... Endalaust' more than floors me with each listen. If I would have to pick one 'desert island song', 'Festival' would be it. I give the movie '127 Hours' a 'thumbs up' only because of my bliss at the inclusion of that song as part of the movie's climax.<br /><br />But this 'Valtari' album does not much rise beyond 'sound' to me. I feel much the same way about Sigur's first album 'Von' (although I would call 'Von' a spooky 'sound' compared to the peaceful 'sound' of 'Valtari' (and Von has several 'propulsive' songs with percussion)). I feel very little 'propulsion' in 'Valtari'. I do think that the sounds are cool, but not rising above peaceful nature sounds (which are cool too). There is virtually no use of percussion (unless you 'count' some of the background 'sounds' as percussion) in 'Valtari', and that is probably why I compare this album to 'nature sounds'. I like to close my eyes and feel the music, but I like the music to have more juice than this. Not to say that this music couldn't juice you.<br /><br />I enjoy much of Sigur's music, so my lack of enjoyment of this album doesn't amount to much (in the big picture).

1594203334|4.0|I downloaded this book a few months ago when I first read the excerpt/interview on the Wall Street Journal.  Being a busy working mom I didn't have the time to really sink my teeth into it until last week when we went on our first family vacation.  I love it!  It's got a great easy-to-read style, lots of anecdotes and lots of references to reasearch from both the U.S. and France on parenting, child development, etc.  I have found the insights from the French parenting approach really helpful as I try to find some sort of balance in my own and the rest of our little family's lives.  I'll be curious to compare it to \\"Tiger Mom\\" at some later point in time... but for now, this book has been really quite helpful for me as I figure out my new mom role.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I play this every day.  I love it!  it is a great way to treat boredom.  give it a try
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is great.  We enjoy the fast paced and changing runs. We also love to chaplets eachother. must try this game!!!!
B004SD5GZ4|4.0|Now able to highlight, comment, callout, sign, draw, and the like, which is indispensable to me for academic purposes. The code is still far from optimized for the Android platform, however, and file-handling performance (while improving) needs some work, as does overall app responsiveness (this on a clean I717 Note running 2.3.6)  especially with medium- and large files. The UI is pretty sparse, without anything in the way of options (?) and limited file-open capability (wants you to launch it by opening files rather than browse for them from inside the app, which is weird to me but more common in Android). Has an internal MRU list but only saves current position for last document opened (frustrating for Acrobat desktop users) , no OCR capability (reasonable). Devs: keep at it, please, keeps getting better!
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is my new favorite, I was sooo happy when it finnally released on my kindle. GET IT! Forget the haters
B0086700CM|5.0|its about time they put temple run on here..... i got i think five people because i have a kindle and it has a big screen so i can see better when i fo to play tje game its pretty much the thing i do all day
B0015ABRE2|5.0|This is probably one of my favorite seasons of this series. Definitely worth a look if a fan of the series.
B004AM5QT4|4.0|This book is very thrilling, with good main characters, and particularly good villains. There are a few notable plotholes, but the fast pace, good writing, and notable characters make up for it. All in all I think this is a great book, with a few minor flaws.
B003L77GRO|5.0|I'm a huge Dexter fan, and this season didn't disappoint at all. Definitely worth a look if a fan of the series.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have looked for this app forever! everyone should get it! if u look at all reviews almost everybody has a 5 star!! get the app people!
B0013TPV0Q|5.0|I love everything that Sedaris writes but this book is my all time favorite.<br />Funniest ever.<br />Too bad I can read his books faster than he can write them.<br />More, please, David.
1595826971|5.0|I bought this book with the game. I was a fan of the original game so when it came out I snatched it. The art in this book is breathtaking. I acutally used this book to show my tattoo artist pictures so he could do a tattoo of alice since I like the games so much
B005FQ2H8W|3.0|I bought this movie in the VHS version several years ago but I was disappointed that it was not closed-captioned. It was captioned while shown on TV and on HBO several decades ago. I recently rented it from Netflix to see if it had been upgraded and either closed-captioned or English-subtitled. Still not. So there I go again, waiting again. It is one of my favorite movies regardless of how old it is.
B000PKX2KA|5.0|I run iNav iGuidance on a car PC, this is the 3rd GPS puck I have used and it gives me NO trouble whatsoever (Compared to a Microsoft & some generic I had before)<br />Locks on VERY quickly & works well, being waterproof, I moved it from my Dashboard to the roof, 50X better.<br /><br />Can't say enough good about it.
B000YXMMAO|5.0|What can you say about this album that hasn't already been said? Wonderful, WONDERFUL album. Highly recommended, especially on vinyl.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I bought Monty Python and the holy grail for my partner, he absolutely loves it, i was extremely happy that the dvd was delivered promptly and in tact, no damage what so ever to the outer cover.  Will definately buy from amazon again.
B0086700CM|3.0|A great game but on kindle fire wont turn jump slide or any of the above. It's like it doesn't read me turning jumping or sliding.But its great on any other device I have tried it on.
B007SSEBCU|4.0|I loved it. I felt Meryl Streep did such a good job I wasnt't seeing her. Once in a while I did. It of course had some long moments, but then again it was about a British woman. Ha! I loved seeing Margaret as a young girl. & thinking about the choices she made in life to get where she wanted. It want always pleasant. I really enjoyedit.
B005LAIGOQ|2.0|I wanted to like this movie, but.... I feel Radcliff was a poor choice for the grieving widower. He seemed unemotional and unafraid which did nothing for the character in the movie. I loved him in the Harry Potter/Lord of the Ring movies. I think he could be a good actor but not in this part. The flashbacks to the character's lost wife should have brought a tear or two to his eye but nothing but a blank stare each time. The scenery was gloomy, the house pretty scary, the idea of the waters covering the road gave the house a creepy air of isolation. The scared villagers were somewhat interesting but weren't enough to make it a good movie. I love a good horror mystery but this was not as scary as advertised.
B0086700CM|5.0|AMAZON: THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GETTING TEMPLE RUN. EVERYONE (I THINK) IS VERY HAPPY AND EXCITED THAT AMAZON GOT TEMPLE RUN. SO THANKS AGAIN AMAZON. Also this game is very very very fun. If you want a fun addicting game I would get TEMPLE RUN!! I LOVE TEMPLE RUN!! THANKS AGAIN AMAZON!
145162445X|5.0|Krauss starts by introducing you to early physics. I've tried physics courses and books and it all seemed to go in one ear and out the other. Krauss describes everything in a fun and easy to follow manner. He uses explanation points a lot more than I am used to seeing in science books, but so long as he's getting his facts right it's just showing his passion for the topic.<br />I would say that I loved this book, but after reading and rereading chapters for a few months, with about three chapters left, I lost the book without finishing it. Not only does this mean that I will buy the book again, but it means I plan to reread all of it so that I can re underline all the same parts that I had in my first copy. If you're passionate about physics, cosmology, I recommend this book... twice.
B0086700CM|5.0|i am so happy this came out i was waiting for drawsomething and temple run to come out and they did my wishes came true !:)!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|like Mario bros. classic game but rainbow style with leprachauns. its easy to learn and helpful hint the shadow is to use ur nut fire power!
B0086700CM|5.0|The kindle fire finally has temple run for freeeeeeee! This game i have played on my brothers ipod and loved it but with consistently changeing his pass code i cant play it as much as i wont so thank you so much temple run makers!!!!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|When I heard about this book, how it was popular, I went on amazon and read some reviews; I always do before buying books. I've seen so many negative critics that I had to rethink. So before purchasing, I asked a friend to lend me hers. I can tell you that I was happy afterwards that I didn't spent $ 9.99 on this.<br />I really agree with meymoon's review when she asked if a teenager wrote this. I'm sorry to say that, but even some teenagers don't write things like that. Christian is an impossible character. He is obcenely rich at 27 (Is he some kind of drug dealer?), and passes time ordering things to people and having fun with his subs... And Ana, she's so innocent that sometimes she appears to me that she's retarded.<br />Anyway, the story could have been great. I like the idea of a boy tortured as a child who growns up and swear not to be vulnerable and dependable, but this is far too much. I hope book 2 and 3 are better written. The story had potential, too bad!<br />In spite of all this I did laugh a lot; all these \\"blushing,smirking, frowning\\" was entertaining in a weird sort of way.I sure hope that there's more to come and I encourage the author to keep up her work. Eventually, she'll get better at it. After all, practice makes perfect.<br />I'd give it a 2 1/2 but that's not possible on amazon so I give it a 3 star.
B0086700CM|5.0|Love this game...a very very very fun way to pass time...my kids love this game also...very very very entertaining!!!This game is for all ages!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Excellent book...a non-stop read!! At first you may find it a little unnerving but quickly you move past that.  When you finish reading this you can barely wait to start the next book in the trilogy!!  Greatly entertaining!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This is, in my opinion, and if not the best, one of the best free apps on the Amazon market. It works close to perfect on my Kinle Fire. Great graphics, very entertaining, and can keep you from boredom for a long while.I think I might be mildly obsessed with this app...Which doesn't happen a lot. It is very well done. I higly recommend this epic app. My only problem with this app is the very rare freeze, and the fact that with the Kindle Fire, it is a little harder to tilt because of the weight of the Kindle, and after about 15-20 minutes of playing this app my arms start to get sore from the lifting and tilting to get coins...
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book is amazing!! Read it in a day because I couldn't put it down! Hope there is so much more from Hugh Howey. I have been on a sci-fi marathon and Howey ranks with best:  Robert  Heinlein, Edgar Burroughs, Kim Stanley Robinson, John Scalzi, Joe Haldeman, David Brin. Amazing!! Just read the book!!! He stands up with legends!
B007QXU0ZO|5.0|Around the time that Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros released Up From Below, I read in the music press that singer-visionary Alex Ebert had to go to rehab and get clean and sober before he could create the Edward Sharpe mythos and make this wild dreamy happy music. When I finally got to see this band's live show on the Railroad Revival Tour, I couldn't help being alarmed by Alex's aura of frantic and antics of folly. If this isn't a relapse, it must be some old-time religion.<br /><br />When gathered as a band, they're not just messengers of love, they're old school troubadours, and they are also poets, painters, photographers, and chefs. On the follow-up album Here, we see some solid evidence that it's not bad drugs but good religion that's cascading all over my ears.<br /><br />The record shifts from subtle woozy hypnotic gospel pop to overt folksy gospel revival, channeling a mystical mashup of Johnny and June Cash meets John and Yoko with mild dashes of Jack and Meg meets Sonny and Cher.  It's all Up With People meets the Allman Brothers down at the groovy altar call. Permanent summer camp is in session, and we're all drunk on the non-alcoholic communion grape juice.<br /><br />\\"Man On Fire\\" launches the ritual with a simple, profound, and grandiose request: \\"I want the whole damn world/To come dance with me.\\" And the pop ambiance, people's message, and energizing-mesmerizing quality of the band's live shows actually make that possible.<br /><br />\\"That's What's Up\\" reminds us that Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros are still what's up. But it also reassures us that \\"Home,\\"Alex's epic duet with Jade Castrinos on the first album, was by no means a fluke. These two can sing to each other in ways that feel more than real. They sing: \\"Love is our shelter/Love is our cause/Love goes on forever/Yeah love will lead us all/Love, it is our honour/Love, it is our all/Love goes on forever/Yeah love it is our home.\\" Love is definitely what's up. It always has been, and let's hope it always will.<br /><br />\\"I Don't Wanna Pray\\" is a toe-tapping, hand-clapping, old-school-bus-quality singalong that takes me back to summers at camp and the sweet smell of mountains mingled with the strange smell of school-bus seat. Alex brings a message - not against prayer per se - but against the separation between prayer and everyday life. It's a truly holy hope that we'll all transcend being the \\"pray-er\\" to be prayer itself.<br /><br />Swooning high on the 60s-70s orchestral vibe, \\"Dear Believer\\" pulls us back to paradise, teaches that \\"reaching for heaven is what I am on earth to do.\\" Then \\"Mayla\\" mingles \\"The Mighty Quinn\\" with \\"Come Thou Font\\" like a classic radio or church piece, coming forth with more magical mystery tours for the heart and mind in such short time!<br /><br />The sweet summer rain reigns with \\"All Wash Out,\\" a soft but strong symphonic crescendo to the whole affair. It's all forgiveness and sweet healing and freedom from our chains.<br /><br />If this all sounds far too SoCal Jesus Freak as mere marketing move, it doesn't help that front(sha)man Alex fits the hippie messianic look to a tee. But Alex is not the second coming, his band is just coming on tour to a festival or theater near you. In a world where love is sometimes in short supply, Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros amp love loudest and into the farthest dimensions. The music seems more than sincere to me, and listening to it forms a sincerely happy and habit-forming experience. - Andrew William Smithnd let's hope it always will.<br /><br />\\"I Don't Wanna Pray\\" is a toe-tapping, hand-clapping, old-school-bus-quality singalong that takes me back to summers at camp and the sweet smell of mountains mingled with the strange smell of school-bus seat.

B0064X7FVE|4.0|I think that the Weather.Channel app is very cool.  I love this app.  I can check the weather.when ever I want.thanks 2 this app.
B0000009SG|5.0|Witty, catchy tunes, tongue in cheek lyrics and with the usual FZ attention to detail. The quality of musicianship is fantastic and the overall sound is one hundred percent. For those who find the usual FZ (if there is such a thing)a bit much to handle then you might find this a little more accesable.
B0086700CM|5.0|i love this game. great graphics and no hiccups!  Great competition with the so!  can't pull myself away from this one!!!  awesome game!
B0000009TK|5.0|I have most, if not all, of the great man's work and this is right up there, top 5. If you are expecting Dave Brubeck, or Buddy Rich style jazz then move on, but if you like Miles Davis type jazz, of his latter years, buy this. It opens with Stinkfoot (not jazz), but then moves on to some extraordinary jazz instrumental passages with some enthralling guitar solos and some equally brilliant saxaphone. Two CDs, gripping from beginning to end. If you are into jazz but not necessarily FZ, buy it, you will not be disappointed and is an album any jazz fan should have in the collection.
0062082353|5.0|Many Shots, Many Kills.<br />Navy SEAL Chris Kyle's memoire American Sniper is superb in all respects.  Written in gripping vignette style, American Sniper is the autobiography of  America's most lethal military sniper.  It deals with the totality of a man trained to the highest military standards in the art of killing--The Sniper.  Alone in his art, Chief Kyle experiences both the dramatic highs and lows of being a sniper.  As a Navy SEAL, more was expected from him but in reality he was just another combat warrior doing his job.  Fighting in the urban environs of Iraq, his job in a nutshell was to protect his fellow warriors as a sniper overwatch while his fellow warriors cleared buildings.  If he saw the enemy approaching he would \\"take them out\\" before they could engage his fellow warriors.  There were rules (Rules of Engagement-ROEs) that had to be followed as each kill was witnessed, documented and debrief.  Killing an innocent was murder and could be adjudicated as such, so Chief Kyle had to be sure each kill was legal within the ROEs.  At times, Chief Kyle would join in clearing buildings, although that was not within his assigned duties and technically could get him disciplined.  He enjoyed combat but did not relish it.<br />Well craft autobiography.  I enjoyed the no nonsense description of combat.  Having been there I found Chief Kyle's analysis to be right on the mark.  I also liked how he brought in his wife, Taya, to flesh out the Chris Kyle saga.  Taya's story is amazing and helped soften Chief Kyle's gripping high energy story.  She gave the memoire needed depth.  I also appreciated how Chief Kyle concluded his autobiography in upbeat fashion.  Living with death on a daily basis and seeing one's friends wounded and dead can quickly darken one's personality and view of life.  Chief Kyle examined all this and his views are greatly appreciated.  Taya should be commended for realizing what Chief Kyle was going through and standing by her man.  Currently,a very high divorce rate in the military world of multiple deployment is one of the dirty secrets in today's overly stretched military.  Chris Kyle's book does a great positive service in this respect and should be read if for no other reason but to better acquaint the non military person with the trails and tribulation of combat life.<br />Strong recommend.  Keep in mind that Chief Kyle's combat sniping was mainly done in Iraqi urban areas(Bagdad, Fallujah, and Ramadi) which were target rich environments.  His longest shot was 2100 yards but not the norm in an urban environment like Iraq.  Afghanistan snipers generally operate in non-urban mountainous areas which are not target rich and therefore requires longer shots resulting in fewer overall kills.  Another point to keep in mind, Chief Kyle, like most SEALS, operated alone without a spotter.  Army and Marine snipers generally operate with a spotter.  American Sniper is the real deal and a relatively quick read as you will not be able to put it down.  Enjoy and learn.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|A friend recommended the books and when I finished a book I was already reading I purchased the trilogy. I very much enjoyed it.
B0052VUNHC|2.0|Okay I am only giving it two stars because I have to admit that at first I was really into it, but it just got so annoying towards the middle. It was just the same thing over and over again, they fight and make up and the guy is not believable I mean seriously he sounds so desperate it is so annoying. At first I thought he was sweet, he changed his bad ways for this girl but wow was I wrong. This book had a lot of potential, but I think the author ran out of ideas towards the end. Really its so immature, it would probably appeal more to high school girls, I doubt it would appeal to an adult because it is just really annoying. I am sorry I could not find a better word to describe this book, it is just annoying.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game does not need wifi so it is good for on the go and also makes time go by really fast and it is supper fun get this ap it is so worth it
0345522303|5.0|Don't get me wrong I was overjoyed when Flewelling picked the Nightrunner series back up with Shadows Return but it did suffer from the hiatus she took for the other trilogy.<br /><br />White Road was an improvement and a good solid book but Casket of Souls sees us not only back in Rhíminee but back into the original pace and beautiful balance of mystery and fantasy that drew me to Luck in the Shadows, Stalking Darkness and Traitor's Moon in the first place.<br /><br />Casket of Souls feels a lot more like the first three books of the series, not only in terms of setting and secondary characters but also the writing style which I always felt was one of Flewellings strengths and set her apart from the run of the mill fantasy genre.<br /><br />I am definitely enjoying this one!
B0086700CM|3.0|it stats out good but then it starts to drag. it gets so frustrating I want to throw my kindle across the room. if it gets fixed it will be grate.
B0086700CM|3.0|I have this game on the ipad and I really liked it. I got it on my kindle fire and it runs slow. The person trips for no reason. I wish it worked better.
B004BLJQOK|4.0|I recently had a debate with a friend about the Swedish film [[ASIN:B001V7YJMG Let the Right One In (English Subtitled)]] vs. \\"Let Me In.\\"  We had both seen \\"Let the Right One In\\" and loved it.  Such a beautifully made movie, and my heart just breaks for Eli and Oskar.  I couldn't get the movie out of my head, and I read many reviews of the film, just to learn others' perspectives.  Of course, I read the book [[ASIN:0312656491 Let Me In]] that preceded the movie.  All of it helped me to better appreciate Let the Right One In.  This was why I was excited to learn that an American version would be made.  When discussing this with my friend, he was horrified that there would be a remake, and thought that it was an insult to the Swedish film.<br /><br />What a challenge for Matt Reeves, the director, to make his version of a film that was beloved by audiences around the world.  The essence of the story remains the same: a young boy, Owen, is horribly bullied by classmates at school, and he's neglected by his single mother at home.  When Abby moves into his apartment complex, Owen finds a kindred spirit - a young girl who seems every bit as lonely as he is.  She promises Owen she will protect him, and by the end of the film, she certainly fulfills that promise.  When Owen learns her secret, and when Abby's own life is at risk, he returns the favor.<br /><br />Chloe Grace Moretz as Abby is fantastic.  She had already proven her ability to play a strong, young girl in [[ASIN:B003TOMAPC Kick-Ass]].  There are scenes that made my heart race (especially the car scene.)  I thought the rearranging of the chronology of several scenes worked well, although I wondered if Reeves' main intention of this was to differentiate himself.  It's an excellent movie that deserves to be seen.  Overall, though, Let the Right One In is the superior movie, and it has nothing to do with the fact that it came first.
0345803485|1.0|Im sorry, but this book makes me sad. My mom raised me to be a strong woman and this book spits on the progress woman have made over the last couple decades. The fact that woman are buying this book AND reading the sequels makes me sad that woman today have that low self esteem.  I am by no means a feminist or a radical, but it is truly truly sad that woman are reading this book and excited by it. Be excited by your own strength... Not by a book all about taking it away
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting FOREVER for this app. It's so much fun, I could play for hours! One of the best things right now is that it's free, normally a popular game like this would cost some money but this doesn't and that adds to the greatness. Thank you for making this app for Kindle Fires, but app yet!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love it!!!!! I had temple run on my I pod and searched it on my kindle but it never showed up and it finaly is in the kindle store.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I like this app more than I thought I would.  I like the variety of the games.  My kids also enjoy playing the various games.

0307352145|5.0|\\"There's a word for \\"people who are in their head too much\\":  thinkers.\\"<br /><br />I already knew before reading Quiet: The Power of Introverts in a World That Can't Stop Talking by Susan Cain that I am most definitely an introvert.  Consider the damning evidence: I would rather stay home and read than go to a party (unless it's composed of close friends).  I often find it painful to make small talk.  I enjoy being alone.  And although people tell me I have a strong personality, I loathe to be the center of attention, preferring instead to be, yes, the quiet, observant one.<br /><br />Yet despite knowing this about myself, I was astonished by how Quiet illuminated my personality, the personalities of those I knew, and my relationships.  Reading Quiet was absolutely revelatory.<br /><br />It explained so much and connected so many dots for me that I couldn't stop talking about it for weeks after I read it.<br /><br />Quiet delves into all aspects of introverts such as the historical, psychological, biological.  Cain, for example, pinpoints when our society transformed from a culture of character to a culture of personality.  The world now celebrates an Extrovert Ideal - paying attention and valuing charisma and a bold personality, men and women of action over the \\"quieter\\" ones, those who prefer contemplation.  She directly connects the 2008 financial collapse to our society's misplaced faith in extroverts - thinking that those who are the loudest and most persuasive should be at the helm of our financial institutions, without proof that they actually knew what they were doing.<br /><br />\\"Introversion---along with its cousins sensitivity, seriousness, and shyness--is now a second-class personality trait, somewhere between a disappointment and a pathology.\\"<br /><br />Growing up, and even now, I always felt that my introverted tendencies meant that there was something wrong with me.  Why didn't the prospect of large, boisterous parties attract me?  Why did I like being by myself so much?  Why did I hate making small talk when it was so easy for others?  My sister always made fun of me for having much fewer friends than she did.  It turns out that all these tendencies didn't mean that I was abnormal (phew!).<br /><br />Most of the above stems from the fact that I need less stimulation than extroverts, who need the constant energy from socializing and interacting with other people.<br /><br />Furthermore, being shy and/or antisocial is not synonymous with being an introvert.  I love getting together with my friends and planning dinners, movies, and activities.  But unlike extroverts, I prefer smaller groups.  My introverted nature likes one-on-one interactions over large parties.  I prefer depth rather than breadth.<br /><br />Quiet celebrates the fact that I and other introverts flourish in solitary pursuits - which is a powerful affirmation.  Rather than saying we need to be more outgoing or social, in other words, go against our own nature, Quiet says the world benefits from letting introverts be exactly who they are.  Albert Einstein, Van Gogh, Gandhi - all introverts.<br /><br />\\"Some of our greatest ideas, art, and inventions---from the theory of evolution to Van Gogh's sunflowers to the personal computer--came from quiet and cerebral people who knew how to tune in to their inner worlds and the treasures to be found there.\\"<br /><br />What's troubling is that the world - from schools to the workplace - are geared towards the Extrovert Ideal.  Group work anyone?  I hated doing that in school and I hate doing it now.  Why?  Because inevitably, either I do all the work while the group sits on my labor OR one person, usually the loudest and most persuasive, somehow dictates the direction the entire group will go.  Yet my schoolmates and I were routinely forced to work in groups.  In the workplace, Groupthink, as Cain puts it, is the trend, where everyone is forced to sit a room together to brainstorm ideas, even though studiesshow that it is less productive.<br /><br />I could go on and on about everything I learned in Quiet, but suffice it to say that this is a powerful, insightful, and thought-provoking must-read not only for introverts, but anyone who is close to an introvert - which is to say, everyone should read it!
B005XTLAQQ|5.0|I can't rate this product on \\"fun\\" or \\"durability\\" as I am a Twilight nerd who will keep the item in the box.  However, if you are a fan of the Twilight series and/or Barbie, this is a great piece to have in your collection.  The detailing of the wedding dress, wedding tiara and ring is impecable.  They also did a great job with the hair and face (can't say the same for the Edward Ken doll).
B0086700CM|3.0|I know most people love it but I don't get that into it. It's fun but I got bored. Glad it's finally for Kindle Fire atleast.
0307454568|3.0|I personally agree with most people who rated this particular book a 3 or a 3.5.Their reviews were exellent, and there is not much I could add to enhance them.  But it is a must read! Lisbeth is such an empowering hero! I feel that those of us who really can't get enough of Lisbeth gave this book a 3, because we just didn't get enough of her.<br /><br />I just read on steig larsson's website that there is a 4th book! Steig's companion of many years has the manuscript on his computer. But because the author died of a heart attack, and did not leave a will; his father and brother inherit the rights to this book. Imagine not just a trilogy if this can be settled!<br /><br />Stieg's companion states that she helped to write all of the books. Steig sent an e-mail stating the beginning and the end of the book are completed, but not the middle. It seems the father, brother and companion have not been able to work this out. It is reported that most of the 4th novel is about Lisabeth. Her character changes and she explains all of her tattoos. They represent who hurt her physically or emotionally.<br /><br />Now it is further stated that Steig had outlines for 10 books! If we could all be so lucky to have that be true!<br /><br />I do agree with the one reviewer who states that this is an example of the stigma of mental illness. I think the main point is that a person can be destroyed by slander. The other point is that despite all the horrible abuse and mistreatment Lisbeth is eccentric, but not mentally ill. And inspite of all of these horrific barriers she is able to overcome. That is what makes her so very empowering. I, too worked with children who have been severely mistreated and labelled, but even though this is a work of fiction, Lisbeth Salander provides hope and strength.<br /><br />I do understand that the aforementioned information provided is not all a review of the book, but I just wanted to share with all of you this potentially hopeful information. the website is: [...]
0060977493|5.0|If there were a way to give this book more than five stars, I would do so. It surely stands far above most five star novels.<br /><br />As I ventured into the story, I was both thrown by the jerky narrative and intrigued by the members of a family who came to life before my eyes. Through vivid descriptions of place, the rural setting at the southern tip of India grew more real to me than my own surroundings. I persevered, and soon understood that the story does not start at the beginning, but near the end. The story line jumps back and forth from past to present, allowing the reader to examine past events in light of the present consequences. When I came to the last page I was stunned, and heartbroken to think that loving the wrong person, at the wrong time, too much, could ultimately destroyed an entire extended family.
B0086700CM|5.0|I had been waiting FOREVER for this to come for the fire. so glad it finally came. I've played it A LOT since I got it. love it!
B0086700CM|2.0|I find it difficult to score more than 125k points. the game lags to the point where it is unplayable to me on my kindle fire. I have it on iphone 4 and ipad and it is a much better experience.
B004OC07GM|5.0|Absolutely essential book for anyone in the position to help drive their company strategy. Great examples of disruptive technologies in multiple fields and the consistent failure of established firms to respond until it is too late.

B007H9B8FS|5.0|Well, here it is.  All the waiting and waiting and finally the new Garbage cd is here.  Have you ever been to a birthday party and the only ice cream they have is vanilla and you hate vanilla?? Or all they have is chocolate and you have been craving strawberry?  How much better the party would have been if they had purchased Neopolitan ice cream, because almost every likes it.  Well, the same can be said with NYKOP.  I know that some people REALLY like Garbage's first and second cds, but not Beautiful Garbage or Bleed Like Me.  Or it might be just the opposite, or maybe they just liked one cd or any combination of the cds.  I honestly feel with this release that they can appease the taste of fans of any of their previous works.  There are hints of Garbage (Sugar and Battle in Me), Version 2.0 (Control and I Hate Love), Beautiful Garbage (Automatic Systematic Habit and NYKOP), AND Bleed Like Me (Felt and Man On A Wire) and then the tracks that aren't listed are more of a mix of all elements of their previous albums mashed up together.  I honestly think what we have here is not just a return to form, but also a big step further.  Garbage has a distinct sound, it was apparent in all of their albums, but the sound was kinda dated by the time that Bleed Like Me came out.  Hell, I really didn't care much for that album, but I think I played Run Baby Run a total of atleast 10 times a day.  With this album, Garbage managed to bring back their signature sound, and also freshen it up and make it sound a little more modern.  I am in no way saying that this cd sounds anything like the over-produced and generic crap they play all over the radio nowadays.  How many times do you hear a song and the artist(?) repeats their name three or 4 times within the first 30 seconds so you know who it is and don't mistake it for some other generic male/female singer that sounds exactly the same.  As soon as you start listening to Automatic Systematic Habit you know it's a Garbage song and when Shirley starts singing, it just confirms it.  All in all this is a very good and accomplished album.  I believe that any lost fans will gravitate back towards the band and they just might snag a few new ones along the way.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I could not put this trilogy down!!!!<br />I am a constant reader but not many books capture my attention the way this set did.<br />Quite a shame we cannot look forward to more like this from the auhtor.<br /><br />At least we have the trilogy to enjoy.
B007X15GRQ|3.0|It was an alright movie could of been better classic marky mark movie. Hopefully his movies in the future are better
B00000IZOR|2.0|A little disappointed. The toy seems old and there is nick on the phone, not like a new buy one at all. The cord for the telephone is so short that my baby has to pick up the entire toy to \\"make a call\\".
B0058VW36U|1.0|I'm sad Cu's they need to make a free one plus I just think even tho its popular it should be free for 'everyone
B0086700CM|5.0|Parents, beware!  This is REALLY ADDICTIVE! Bit I do not think that you will care if you are the ones who are addictive to this game ... This is an AWESOME game. I first found out about it when I was looking through the apps on my friends ipod.
0345529057|5.0|If you are watching the TV show, STOP and read these now. I read the whole series before I watched the show. It makes it so much better. These books are perhaps the best I have ever read. I only wish there were more.<br />These books are huge and I feel that George R.R. Martin deserves more money for these amazing books. 20 bucks is a ridiculous price!
B0086700CM|5.0|OMG!!!! I absolutely LOVE this game!!!! I am so SO happy that they finally put it on the kindle fire!!!!!!!!
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|As a whole, the Trilogy felt as if it was unplanned. The Hunger Games was a truly good book, but I felt as if Collins forced the series further than it needed to go and milked her success too far. That's not to say that I did not also have trouble putting my kindle down, but I was sort of disappointed when I discovered the sequel. The Hunger Games had the perfect ending point, yet the author stretched it further and further.<br />Also, this was another case of the Christopher Paolini badly written, yet genius plot fantasies. There was no elegance in the author's writing and it could be dull at times when it should'nt have. Great book for kids, but you can't please everybody...
B005MLP71Y|4.0|The bee movie is a great movie! It is full of adventure, it's funny, and full of courage!! I think that it's kid apropriate and loved watching it!
B005DC68NI|5.0|Okay, at the risk of hyperbole, this book changed my life!<br /><br />This is the first book I read about publishing digitally.  So, it is the one that lit a fire under me!  I'm glad it was the first because it has become the standard by which I measure the others, and none has surpassed it.<br /><br />This book is well-written with a good balance between inspiration and information, between general principles and specific procedures.<br /><br />From this book I have been given the vision to pursue a life-long dream of writing with the knowledge that my words will actually be published, and maybe even read.  The huge barriers of book proposals, agents, sheaves of rejection notices, and drawn out publishing processes have been removed. I've got my idea list going, a few outlines, and soon will enter the ranks of indie authors!<br /><br />If you are looking for a place to start, this book is it!<br />If you've been disappointed in what you've already read, this book will be a breath of fresh air!<br /><br />I can be a little stingy with my review stars, but this book deserves all five.<br />I'll be following this author.
B0086700CM|5.0|haha it finally came out!! first it was temple rum, then temple ruin, then finally, temple run!!!!!!!!! I'm so freaking loving this game!!!!!!!!
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This is a great sci-fi action adventure type book full of 80's pop culture and video game references.  I enjoyed it so much that I didn't want it to end...and now I wish I had purchased the physical version instead of the Kindle version.  I'd read this again and again until the spine was busted and the pages were worn and dog-eared...when I wasn't loaning it to responsible friends :o)
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Addictive and Enjoyable. Tons of games to pass the time. controls are a little iffy. but isn't that much of a big deal. :)
B0086700CM|5.0|so cool ! ! ! ! ! !  it is awesome! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! get it!!!!!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this app so much although it can get a little tricky and it. is very fun from age range of 5-50
B007J4T2G8|1.0|The only thing good about this book is that it made me realize that anyone can churn out a bunch of drivel and get it published. I can't believe I spent $9.99 on this rubbish. It's poorly written, the plot is taken from a supermarket bodice-ripper, and the sex scenes (to which I skipped as I couldn't stand all the blushing and lip-biting) are about as exciting as watching paint dry. Don't waste your time or money on this book.
B0086700CM|4.0|I absolutely. love this app, but it took forever to get on kindle fire. one thing is that it took a while to download, everyone is getting this app all at once. on the kindle, this app is very bad with graphics, and will not show the picture when I add it with my favorites. overall, I love this app, but is played much better on a phone or ipad.
0060873027|2.0|I've read all of Michael Crichton's books with the exception of \\"Odds On\\", \\"Drug of choice\\" (only because they're so rare) and \\"Electronic Life\\". I'm pretty familiar with his writing style and this ain't it. As in other reviews the main problem is the technical aspects of the story. I'm surprised that he even investigated in this direction. The characters were completely two dimensional (Even more so than his early works as John Lange.), and the character of Drake only lacked a Snidely-Whiplash mustache. (Oh, and the typos! The editors weren't very awake when doing their read-throughs.)<br /><br />On the plus side, the descriptions of the micro-world were fun and interesting. I found it to be a quick read, but saddening. They really should have had Dan Brown (Digital Fortress, Deception Point, and oh yes, those Davinci-code books) complete the writing of this book.<br /><br />It's sort of galling that they left this open to a sequel. (Shudder!)
B0086700CM|4.0|This game is great except for the fact that the wallpaper doesn't download to your gallery,other than that it is great
B0014KFV6I|5.0|Love that ol' music from my younger years.  Always good to see it still available.  I received it quickly, as usual, in good condition and at a fair price.
0345803485|3.0|I have never read erotica before so I don't have much experience with that part of the book, frankly I skipped over most of the sex scenes which happen to be atleast 50% of the book. The book also has a few too many similarities to Twilight. But I would have to say if you can look past all that crap and see the story behind it all, it's not so bad.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game for forever! It has for so long only been on apple and android products. I love this game so much! Great fun easy for all ages! :-)
B004SEUJK0|5.0|I enjoyed this film as much the second time as I did when I first saw it in a theater. One advantage of getting old I suspect, I had forgotten a lot of the story.
B0086700CM|4.0|I love temple run.  Its so fun to play and its really addictive. The only thing is that the app acts kind of funny alot of the time. Whe  i swipe it wont go in the write direction.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Everyone I know has been raving about this book, so I purchased it.  I just don't get it... what is so amazing?<br /><br />1. The writing is terrible.<br /><br />2. The characters relationships and reactions to certain situations aren't believable or realistic.<br /><br />3. 58 references to Ana's \\"inner goddess\\"?!?! \\"and my very small inner goddess sways in a gentle victorious samba.\\" \\"my inner goddess glares at me\\" \\"my inner goddess is thrilled\\" \\"my inner goddess is doing the merengue with some salsa moves\\" \\"my inner goddess has stopped dancing and is staring\\" \\"my inner goddess is thrilled\\" \\"my inner goddess sits in the lotus position looking serene\\" \\"my inner goddess nods in silent zen-like agreement\\" \\"my inner goddess is jumping up and down\\" \\"my inner goddess stops jumping and smiles serenely\\" \\"my inner goddess shakes her head at me\\" \\"my inner goddess glows so bright she could light up Portland\\" \\"my inner goddess frowns at me\\" \\"my inner goddess jumps up and down with cheerleading pom-poms\\" ETC....<br /><br />4. I hate these characters.  Christian is described as having dark copper colored curls.... so Christian is a curly haired ginger??? From the start the male lead in my head is either carrot top or shaun white.  Also, I cannot love a female character who refers to her inner goddess every other paragraph.<br /><br />5. Ana is an idiot who has no sense of probable danger.  Oh, but everyone argues this is a \\"love story!\\" I somehow doubt most intelligent women would place this much trust in a completely broken, abused, obsessive, controlling STRANGER this soon after meeting him.<br /><br />6. The sex scenes, and there are an insane amount of them, aren't really all that hot.<br /><br />7. If I had an inner goddess she would be begging me to gouge my own eyes out rather than read one more page of this crap.  However, since I paid $9.99 for it, Im going to finish the remaining 10 pages praying for a miracle.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was trying to find this game for the longest. I have to admit this game is very addictive. but I loooovvvvveeeee it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0058YPG1G|5.0|There are numerous reviews for this show and I agree with most of the sentiment.  This is the best show on television hands down.  The characters are well-defined and constantly evolving.  This show will revolutionize what television shows should be in relation to real-life.  The episodes are all great and I cannot wait until the final season to see how Vince Gilligan & crew will end this epic tv series.
B007ZGO7EM|2.0|I don't see why this is such a big deal. It doesn't even have square root or square buttons. There is nothing special about it. It is just like a boring calculator you have on your desk. But I guess it is kind of handy.
B0073PPKNM|3.0|Melody Gardot has been one of the most amazingly original talents on the horizon for a long time.  The new album \\"Absence\\" again has fantastic songs and her talent shines again.  I bought the CD and not the MP# download.  My biggest gripe is: what is it with the more than POOR editing of track #11 ????  It is stated that it runs 18.13 minutes on the album.  If that is indeed so then WHY would you have recorded it on the CD running 4 minutes and then include an 11+ minute BLANK spot and then pick up again for the last 3+ minutes?  Really dumb!!  The clicking sound on track #3 is barely noticeable, even when cranked up on a high quality Bose Wave CD player.  However, Miss Gardot deserves better recording quality since she is such an amazing singer.  My 3 stars only reflect my disapproval of the recording staff.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even after all the hype over the movie, I liked this book.  Easy readying.  Keeps your interest.  Plot takes unexpected turns.  I am now reading book #2.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game forever !!! Its finnally here and it is the only game i have played on my Kindle Fire the past 3 days. Hit me up on twitter at @Aj_HUNITMillz13 !!!!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|fun mini games. not too hard makes passing time fun and easy. also great that you can replay previous games and earn more points.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I read all of the amazon reviews about this trilogy, and they are pretty much on point.  However, being a romantic I did like the story line.  For the books being \\"erotica\\"  I was a little apprehensive however it wasn't anything that was too much for the average adult.  I liked the story line because it had compassion and unconditional love.  And it was about the growth of the characters.  Book two was the best out of the three, but no matter what the book reviews say I would still read all three and give it a chance.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was completely unfamiliar with the game but its easy to catch on to and incredibly addictive. So much fun! I was very impressed at the graphics quality (playing on my Kindle Fire). My favorite app yet and you can't beat the price!!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|Loads of fun and it keeps you occupied for hours. The puzzles are diverse and complex enough to hold your attention. This is not a game for those looking for simple 10 x 10 grids.
0374531269|5.0|This book was haunting, troublesome, disturbing, and an awakening call to action all at the same time: The horror that children face everday on this planet is embedded in the painful reality that unfolds, deeper and deeper, as each page of this pensive memoir is turned.  I read it a week after I finished \\"The Hunger Games\\" trilogy, and I couldn't help but to make parallels.  Ishmael Beah's coming-of-age story is a tormenting real life version of \\"Lord of the Flies\\" meets the \\"The Hunger Games,\\" and it bothers me that such a truth exists.  I stayed up all night to read it one sitting, and I'm left wondering: What's happened to the sacredness of childhood, even in war?  And in the end, Beah's words inspire me more than any help I can offer others to answer that question...
B007IXWKUK|5.0|LUV,luv luv this book. The charecters are so well developed and real.I couldn't stop turning the pages.Book two really helps the reader to understand and fall in love with Chritian.You would think,how can this go on for three books,but the love story between Anna and Christian for me was bigger then the sex(and thats great too). Great book!
B0063GORYU|5.0|it is a very good game and very addicting to play. the format is a very good format. it is good f<br />or all users
B007SGM084|5.0|This is quite an interesting and imaginative trilogy.  If you are open-minded with a sense of humor this book is fabulous.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This is an ok game to be free. Some games are fun, but others are more on the dumb side. This is a game I love to play with my 4 year old.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I just started playing but I really like this game so far! Lots of goals to complete and it doesn't require real money to enjoy playing. A fun way to waste some time!
0345803485|3.0|I like the sexual tension of the story but the actual sex is not believable.  For a virgin to climax three or four times during one encounter from penetration alone is just stupid to me.  I'm sure there is someone in this world who has had this experience but it's way far from the norm.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy is a must read!  I am not a reader, I kept hearing about these books and thought I'd try them.  I read all three books in 9 days!! I could not put them down. I got very little sleep, in that time but well worth it. I did not want the story to end.
B004UQ03P2|5.0|This screen protector is wayyyyy worth the cost! You may want to buy a cheap $5 screen protector, or even the knock off version of this that I almost bought, but believe me, get this one.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />-EASIEST screen protector I have ever installed. I peeled off the back and stuck it on, not only did it easily stick on with NO bubbles! but it is the exact fit of the screen, so it's not possible to mess up putting it on and not getting it perfectly straight. :) :)<br /><br />-REUSABLE!!!! I have never had a reusable/cleanable screen protector for anything, and I didn't even know this one was until I read the packaging and instructions. In fact, the instructions even recommend that you clean and reapply your screen protector every once in a while. So not only is it amazing the first time you put it on, but you don't have to keep buying screen protectors when they start to unstick or get too dirty - just wash and reuse! :D<br /><br />-it turns my glossy arse screen matte, now I can actually see what im doing on this damn shiny screen, yay!<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />Uh, none.. well price, but still, way worth it in the end. This is only quality product, hats off to you Moshi!<br /><br />&lt;3 Nicole
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is the best game ever its super sensitive to your finger tips again five stars easily super fun
B006GHA9VQ|3.0|I reeeely wanted to like this performance. I must admit I only found it mildly entertaining. The script stretches every which way with no obvious justification or direction. In this follow up to \\"Phantom of the Opera\\", Raoul and Christine find themselves in New York AND mostly in Coney Island - yes, Coney Island. The Phantom has taken up residence there with a freak show and seems to have brought the two lovers (now married and packing a ten year old son) to New York under the pretense of Christine's appearing for the impresario, Oscar Hammerstein I. Without getting into the plot; there isn't much of one here - the performers must be given their due, making much of the nothing they've been given to speak. They have even less to sing; there is only one memorable song in the entire performance; \\"Love Never Dies\\" - which had it's initial incarnation in a number sung by Kiri Te Kanawa \\"The Heart Is Slow To Learn\\". I think the better choice would have been to stick to the original lyric. Those offered in this performance have little meaning and are slightly repetitious.<br />The most disappointing aspect of this blu-ray is the minimal, flat, crammed audio - it has no depth, width or dynamic range. You'll be hard pressed to hear the difference in quality or stereo imaging between the 5.1 and 2.0 audio choices. Switch back and forth - you'll see what I mean. So, this long awaited sequel (by me) to the classic Phantom musical falls flat in my estimation and joins the embarrassing company of the \\"Les Miz\\" concert at Albert Hall for reeeeely crappy audio. The lack of expertise in some of the concert blu-rays and the annual Tony Awards leads me to wonder where all the capable audio people have gone. Is there something in Vegas; a convention or continuing product show? There can be no excuse for poor, sub-standard audio in this day and given the current paradigm. Even more confusing is the fact that both Lloyd-Webber and Cameron Mackintosh gave the \\"go\\" to releasing their material with inferior audio!<br />In closing, this production is an eye full! The set design by designer Gabriela Tylesov is a knockout. It has a Tim Burton feel and look to it; alive with color and imagination. The lighting and staging are similarly fantastic and enjoyable. While this Blu-ray is an eye-full, it's sadly short of an ear full. Kudos to the director, designer, costumer and lighting designer. The audio guys responsible for the film mix (not to be confused with the house sound) should give back their pay checks for this debacle.ial with inferior audio!<br />In closing, this production is an eye full!

B0086700CM|5.0|this game is totally five stars its the best game ever its super sensitive to the tilt when you want to turn
B004VSTP4Y|5.0|Okay, there's a bunch of negative reviews about the ending, which I don't get. FOREVER was a beautiful ending to a beautiful trilogy and I'd reccomend it to anybody.<br />I think the people giving only one star are just upset because it's over.
B0086700CM|4.0|I like the game but its kinda. glitchy and not super fun to play what its glitchy if u know what I mean
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best game ever!!:)I love playing it ,but Im a little obcessed!:) I hope you like it to! :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I play it all the time. I love how it has a lot of action in this game. the cool part is that your running away from these crazy monkeys and it pumps your heart with awesomeness. I love this game and you will to
B000UX6THK|5.0|If you are a fan of Twin Peaks than this collection is a must have, looks great in any library and inlcudes the pilot episode to the finale, the pilot and 1st and 2nd seasons are much more expensive when bought seperately and the 1st season does not include the pilot. If you consider yourself a fan, you must own this box set!
B0086700CM|5.0|I been wanting this game on the kindle fire and now I have it . Its so awasome but you can't stop play it.BEST GAME EVER
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great game. Highly addictive. Even my eight-year-old begs to play. Would totally recommend. Two thumbs way up!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|this game is awesome shows lots of detail. please get it I will be ur neighbor.love it.  my id is alixzandria
0345803485|3.0|This book is a spin off of Pretty Women. Rich man changes the womens life. Sex on the Piano. Few changes like one is a virgin and one a prostitute. Maybe it is a little more kinky sex but same story. I heard they are going to make a movie. In my opinion it was written in like the 80s
B0086700CM|5.0|it took quite a while but worth the wait very addicting little game keeps the kids busy on car rides too double bonus:D
0439023513|3.0|I am a HUGE fan of the Hunger Games books and as much as I love the series, this book unfortunately fell short from my expectations. Collins did such an amazing job in building up the story line in the previous books that this book just did not seem to do justice to the story. Mockingjay had a really great start but then by the end of it, it felt like the author was trying to condense, what could have been another book, into a chapter. I really felt that the book was rushed 2/3 into the book. Collins could have ended this book with Katniss, and the other rebels, infiltrating the capitol and started another book with that. It was still, however, a great read and I highly recommend reading the entire series to other people.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! and now they finally have it for the kindle! super thrilled! this game is soooo fun and addicting!!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I purchased this on sale at another retailer and for the price I paid, it was truly a steal. I love this thing so much. Even the integrated graphics, which I thought I would never use, I ended up using until my discrete card arrived. The stock cooler sucks. But if you are buying the K version, I doubt you were planning on using it anyways.
B0086700CM|5.0|words can't describe how much I love this game.<br />this game is very addicting and I cannot stop playing. I love the fact that you can have powers like &quot;resurrection
B007IFZU5A|4.0|I have to say, after Paradise Lost's last installment, \\"Faith Divides us... Death Unites Us\\", I was very much looking forward to this release. Being a longtime fan, it has been nice to see Paradise Lost get back to the formula of their early albums, namely Icon and Draconian Times. From the first track, upon first listen, it is abundantly clear that this album shares influences with both Icon and Draconian times. While Nick Holmes' vocals are a bit more refined than they were nearly 20 years ago, the guitar play of Greg Mackintosh, which is always great, is far more aggressive than the Draconian predecessor. In fact, most of the album is more aggressive than past offerings. The surprising bit of all this is that although I looked forward to this release for a LONG time, the first listen was as close as makes no difference, disappointing. However, it must be said that my first listen to \\"Faith Divides Us...\\" was much the same way, as was my first listen to \\"Shades of God\\" - Underwhelming. However, with each subsequent listen, each of those discs grew on me to the point where they rank among my favorite PL albums. The same holds true for \\"Tragic Idol\\". One of the biggest noticeable differences between this and other PL albums, and possibly what makes this album very unique, is the drumming. New drummer, Adrian Erlandsson adds a more aggressive approach to the percussive element than previous percussionists Lee Morris, Jeff Singer and Matt Archer, which creates a vastly different feel to the whole experience. Though the rest of the lineup has remained stable since the late 80's, the change in drummer has created vastly different feels for each PL era, if you will, and this is no exception. The bottom line: Hardcore and longtime PL fans will not be disappointed. PL creates a solid album with few low points to speak of and recaptures the feel of their great early 90's releases.
B003W5C0VW|3.0|How come the 1970's has the best music, but the worst fashion and video qualities? Musically, this is a very fine concert. The Stones are on, there is a nice variety of tunes, and Mick Taylor in particular is excellent. My frustration is that there isn't much to see. The camera work - although steady - is very limited. There are virtually no full-group shots, views of the audience, or good visuals of the incomparable Charlie Watts. However, Mick Jagger does an interview in which he explains that that is what they had to work with in those days. The quality of the camera work is very good, just limited in its variety. Song-wise, besides the usual suspects, are some renditions of \\"Dead Flowers\\", \\"Rip This Joint\\", and \\"All Down the Line\\". A highlight of the package are two interviews with Mick, one from 1972, the other from 2010. They are very entertaining.
B005S9EJ14|4.0|Seven British seniors leave the familiarity of their homeland to immigrate to India. Some are lured by the ads for 'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel', offering an oasis for elderly inhabitants. Some are lured by memories of their youth. Some make the journey due to necessity.<br /><br />Written by Ol Parker and directed by John Madden (\\"Shakespeare in Love\\", \\"The Debt\\"), \\"The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel\\" features seven of the finest British actors working today in an amusing, insightful and only occasionally, predictable look at how their lives are changed by their move to the exotic former colony.<br /><br />Evelyn Greenslade (Judi Dench) decides to make the move when her husband passes away leaving a mountain of debt. Her sons are trying to get her to move in with them, but Evelyn is too independent for that. Forced to sell the house and with little money, she spots an online ad for the Best Exotic Marigold Hotel and decides to move. Graham Dashwood (Tom Wilkinson) can no longer stand the thought of living in England and leaves for the airport directly from his retirement party at the college where he teaches law. He is moving to India for an entirely different reason; as a young boy, his family lived in the area and he is looking up an old acquaintance. Douglas and Jean Ainslie (Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton) find they are now retired and have limited funds due to an ill-advised investment in their daughter's internet company. Rather than spend their golden years in a boxy flat designed for the elderly, complete with a panic button, Douglas convinces Jean that they should move to India. Muriel Donnelly (Maggie Smith), a bigoted old woman, finds she needs a hip replacement. Rather than spend six months or longer waiting for her name to come up on the National Health Service waiting list, she agrees to go to India for the surgery. Norman Cousins (Ronald Pickup) is a lech who finds his limited resources will go further in India as he tries to find an eligible, rich widower. Madge Hardcastle (Celia Imrie) is basically the female equivalent of Norman, a woman who is using her limited resources to catch a rich widower. The British citizens meet at the airport and become traveling companions. Sonny Kapoor (Dev Patel, \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\") greets his new guests with open arms. He is thrilled because they are his first guests and promise an income as he continues to prepare the hotel his deceased father bought for the guests. One day, he will be able to make it as nice as the brochure and website promise. He can now make his father's dream a reality, if only his older, more successful brothers and his mother would not interfere. The Brits find things are less than ready, less than hospitable. Some of them adapt and learn to enjoy their new lives. Some have more trouble.<br /><br />When you have this many characters in a film, it is often difficult for any of them to appear real or human. Often, they have one or two traits, one or two quirks and this is all the filmmakers are able to give them, so they become cartoon characters. \\"The Best Exotic...\\" should be applauded because it is much more successful, giving more of the characters real complexity. But a few of the characters do fall short.<br /><br />When your cast includes Judi Dench, Maggie Smith, Bill Nighy and Tom Wilkinson, you would expect the film to be above the norm. And \\"The Best Exotic...\\" delivers. In fact, the characters played by these actors are the best of the bunch.<br /><br />Penelope Wilton's Jean is a bit too shrewish throughout, giving her character the least interesting growth. Because of this, she also makes Douglas (Nighy) the most predictable. But they have a nice, somewhat unexpected, moment towards the end of the film.<br /><br />Ronald Pickup's Norman and Celia Imrie's Madge are the most predictable and seem to be included for comic relief. Interestingly, I read that Peter O'Toole and Julie Christie were originally going to play these roles. I'm not surewhy they dropped out. Strangely, I get the feeling Pickup and Imrie are playing these characters as written. What the actors are able to impart on the characters doesn't seem to come through as it does with the other actors. I can't exactly pinpoint why this is, but it feels like they don't bring anything of their own to the characters.<br /><br />Dench is possibly the most complicated character. As Evelyn makes the journey, she states to more than one person she has never been outside of England and her two grown sons seem to regard this decision to move as a minor moment of indiscretion. When she arrives in India, you see moments of fear, excitement and understanding flash through her face at various times. But Evelyn's situation is such that she needs to get a job and this provides some nice moments, a nice circle of closure.<br /><br />Dench is such a great actress and I am more used to watching her portray powerful, strong women. It is nice to watch her play a woman who is more down-to-earth, more vulnerable. Evelyn provides proof of Dench's range; Evelyn is strong - she would have to be to make this move and embrace it - but she is also vulnerable and open to all the new country has to offer.<br /><br />Tom Wilkinson plays Graham, perhaps the most experienced of the group of travelers. Given he grew up in the country; the others turn to him for advice and guidance. Graham has spent the majority of his life living in a way that didn't make him happy. As soon as he retires, the very minute, he decides to leave for the country and look up an old acquaintance.<br /><br />Because the other travelers depend on him, they look at him as an authority figure and more than one of the women seem to develop an attachment to him.<br /><br />Maggie Smith plays Muriel, a former housekeeper who is now living the remainder of her life in a small flat with nothing to do. Deeply bigoted, she is torn between waiting six or more months for her surgery in London, or moving to India and having the surgery almost immediately. The pain wins over her fear of people with brown skin and she moves to a very scary place and seems to regard everything with great hostility.<br /><br />It is a testament to the actress that she manages to bring the most complete character growth to her character; some key interactions lead her to begin to change, yet the changes seem natural and realistic.<br /><br />Bill Nighy and Penelope Wilton play Douglas and Jean. They are forced to move because they simply can't afford to live in England until their investment in their daughter's internet company comes through. If it ever does. Douglas seems more willing to live the adventure. Maybe resigned is a better word. Jean seems completely reluctant to give up the style of life she has become accustomed to in England. Through the course of the film, Jean and Douglas are perhaps the most predictable of the group. But both actors manage to make the characters interesting and mildly surprising in believable ways.<br /><br />Dev Patel, so memorable in \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\" and the BBC America series \\"Skins\\", is problematic. He runs around, waving his hands, talking in a thick Indian accent and he appears to be more similar to Apu, the animated character from \\"The Simpsons\\", than a real human being. He pines for a beautiful girl who works at a local telephone call center, but her brother doesn't approve of him. And his mother arrives just as he re-opens the hotel and tells him he has to close and return home and work for his more successful brothers. His romantic shenanigans are the main reason for this story and they appear too slapstick and comedic to make us really feel the romance.<br /><br />John Madden has created a film that is uneven, providing characters that are predictable alongside other characters who are interesting and believable, in a story that manages to grasp our attention. The different characters are designed to move you, make you laugh, make you cry, makeyou feel the romance and love. Most of the time, these characters work.<br /><br />It is definitely a film worth watching just for the performances of the majority of the leads.and having the surgery almost immediately.

B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I must admit I was expecting more. After watching the first movie I bought the trilogy hoping to escape into it but found myself getting a little frustrated at times with the book. Not that I don't think it's a great story, I actually love the plot but I honestly got bored with the attention given to the relationship saga between the 3 main characters. It felt all too similar to the Twilight trilogy!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so much! I've been waiting so long for this game to come out in the amazon app store! my little sister is jealous and she begs to play every day. :-)
B006OCM0G0|4.0|Im having a good time with this game. I didn't know what to expect.  I thought that this would be another game that would take up space. But it turns out to be pretty fun.
B0086700CM|4.0|Its a fun game and I enjoy. I feel like it's a bit overrated though.<br />It's quite simple. This is a game anyone can enjoy.<br />But it's not glorious.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love playing this game! its so much fun! I Definetly think everybody should start playing! It is awesome! legit!
B0086700CM|5.0|OH MY GOSH IT IS VERY FUN WHEN YOU START PLAYING IT YOU JUST DONT WANT TO STOP.IT VERY ADDITIVE, get this app!
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is so fun I really like how ur person doesn't need energy and doesn't run out of energy like all those other stupid games I like getting new players
B0086700CM|5.0|ive played this game on my friends' iphone and I'm so glad it came to aneroid! so fun and addicting... I luv it! !!
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I love this game.<br /><br />However--I originally put it on my phone, which is an Android with a nice-sized screen (bigger than iPhone.) It was just so hard to accurately fill in the correct squares. So I put it on my Kindle Fire, and am loving it. It would be even better with a larger screen, though. I find that even using a stylus, I often fill in the wrong squares on the medium-sized and larger-sized puzzles. (It's worth it though.... What a great, fun logic game!)
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is freakin awesome.you can play it for hours and not get bored its a fun game to take turns with ire friends
0920236162|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  When I first read it, I loved the surprise ending.  Definitely worth reading to young kids- especially young girls.
B0086700CM|4.0|I LOVE it.! Its so addicting.! Except sometimes it glitches and wont allow me to turn, or when I turn it jumps instead
006117758X|4.0|Quick, raw, sharp and edgy- those are the words I would use to sum up Bukowski's novel about a young man coming of age.  Forced to grow up fast, we see the narrator's life through his own cynical point of view of the world.  As I read this, I found myself connecting with the character because of his isolation and his strength.  The author hits nerves and isn't afraid to open his readers' eyes to a world where kids can't be kids....they have to grow up fast, similar to teens today.  A good choice for male readers.
0439023491|5.0|This book is second in the Hunger Games series. It picks up right where the first book left off. Katniss and Peta have to convince the whole populace of Panem that they are still in love or there are dire consequences.<br /><br />Everything that you liked about the original Hunger Games is in this story. They introduce new characters and give a deeper history of the Hunger Games themselves.<br /><br />One thing I will say about this book is that is actually angered me, but in a good way. I was not angry because I felt like I was wasting my time, or because what the author was saying offended me, but because of what was happening to the characters in the story. It is not very often that a book stirs an emotional response in me. This one stirred quite a few.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|These books are a joke.  Don't waste your money.  I bought them deciding I would see what all the fuss was about.  If you are totally and completely sexually naive and inexperienced, you may enjoy these books.  Somewhere underneath all the ridiculous, repetitive sex scenes there is a love story of sorts.  Keep in mind, the main male character is an accomplished pianist, a helicopter pilot, speaks fluent French, is a billionaire, astonishly good looking, very well hung,owns several mansions, and get this folks, he is only 26 years old.  If I were this author, I would hide my head in shame, but then again, after making the circuit on all the TV stations, she has become a millionaire!  I would think that some Television producer would have read these books before telling everyone how great they were, but I guess that is too much to ask.  Seriously folks, this is junior high school stuff if that.  Save your money!
0439023491|5.0|Catching Fire was an amazing book to read. From the beginning it kept me on my toes. How Katniss still had feelings for Gale yet she was in love with Peeta the other victor and how they had to pretend to be madly in love for President Snow.  I also liked this book because it had action in it how all victors had to go back into the games and how you could feel Katniss pain because she had to leave her family and might possibly loose Peeta whom she loves. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes sci-fi, romance, or action because this book has all 3 in it. I just couldn't put the book down until I was done.
B007SGM084|4.0|I really enjoyed the 1st book of the triology; but unfortunately, as is the way with triologies I found the 2nd two were sadly lacking.  The shock factor; which I enjoyed with the first book, just wasn't there.
0345803493|5.0|In my opinion, this book was the best of the trilogy! I thoroughly enjoyed the first but it ended abruptly & I was dying to know more about Christian & the relationship with Ana.  I highly recommend Fifty Shades Darker!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I must say I am surprised at the amount of hate this book is getting. I for one thoroughly enjoyed it. The only thing that bothered me was the fact that Ana was not very into the whole BDSM idea, but I blame that on the fact that I love BDSM as much as Christian, and it put me off not being able to relate to the female character as I'd hoped I would. I was constantly angry at her for being a wuss about it all. But I am excited to read the next books. I'm hoping she'll suck it up and realize how lucky she is.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|great game. I love it. it lasted me a while. and was interesting how u had to keep finding ways to earn acorns to finish certain families.  but buying more land got more expensive and was a challenge.
B00723NWJE|4.0|I'm not a fan of Norah Jones.  Sure I'm one of the 25 million who purchased her debut record \\"Come Away With Me\\", but like my mom's apple pie one serving satisfied my sweet tooth.  The draw for her newest release \\"Little Broken Hearts\\" is her producer Danger Mouse.  While he has not yet achieved the fame of Rick Rubin he is certainly one of the top producers working in pop music today.<br /><br />This disc is a collaboration between Ms. Jones and Brian Burton (Danger Mouse's given name).  They share songwriting credits on all of the songs and he plays instruments on eleven of the twelve tracks.  But there is no question that this is a Norah Jones album with her vocals always upfront telling her tales of heartbreak.<br /><br />With all of the songs dealing with love and loss this is properly being billed as a break up album.  But even with that common topic each song has its own style.  It is there that Danger Mouse's talent steps in.<br /><br />There are upbeat songs, slow songs, creepy songs and even a couple that sound like they should have been Danger Mouse's last album.  The nice thing is that each one stands on its own so even though the topic stays the same the beat keeps changing.
0345803485|5.0|Yes, this book is hot, but it's also a really good story. It's a story about first love, the struggle with self-image and wondering whether you are \\"good enough\\" for another. Who hasn't ever felt that way?
B000RZGFZC|5.0|When my husband Benjamin let his 'best friend' Darren be the DJ at our wedding, I should have known, I suppose, what to expect.<br /><br />Right after the first dance (Frank Sinatra's classic, 'Making Whoopee'), this came on. Within four minutes only Benjamin's home-town friends were left standing; the cocktail lounge was deserted, the ballroom was a wasteland, and all my relatives from Connecticut had fled the gazebo.<br /><br />I don't know whom I blame more: Darren, Benjamin, or Slayer.<br /><br />(Though track four has got a good beat.)
0345803485|5.0|Great book! I am almost done with the second book and so far this trilogy is the best ever. If you like hot and steamy sex filled books, this is for you!
0547258305|4.0|Let's see. I'm really not sure where to start. I think there's something wrong with me sometimes. I find that a lot of times when a book has been talked up to me, I end up disappointed with it. And while I can't know for sure that the building up is the culprit because you can never go back and unexperience something, sometimes I wonder if I would feel the same disappointment if I had never heard wonderful things about it. I wish there was a way to find out so I could know if I'm truly screwed up in the head or something. *sigh* Oh well (I'm probably just weird in the head, best to acknowledge it).<br /><br />Graceling was a good book. Better than a good portion of the ones I've read lately, but it still doesn't hit my 5 star rating. (Perhaps I'm too critical. I don't know.) And honestly, the only real thing I can say negatively about it is that I wish there was more of it. So how can that be bad, right? But yet it can be. I'm giving it a good 4.5 stars.<br /><br />Katsa is a really good female lead. She's strong. She's independent--perhaps to a fault. She's not quite at Rose Hathaway level to me though. But the thing is, Katsa's Grace gives her a slight advantage and natural tendency to both of these traits that someone without her Grace would have to work extra hard to accomplish. And while I really do like the idea of the Graces and how unlimited the directions are that can be taken with this idea, I found Katsa's particular Grace to be somewhat convenient--especially when she finds out more about her Grace. I guess I'm more of a fan of the underdog and Katsa's Grace gives her an advantage over the norm.<br /><br />Another thing I found to be convenient was the resolution of the conflict with Leck. It just all seemed too easy and too quickly wrapped up with a nice little bow. Of course, I haven't read the other books in the series, so who knows if that might come back around. I wouldn't think that it would except for the prologue for Fire was included at the back of my paperback copy of Graceling, and the prologue was the story of Leck's childhood. So that left me wondering what the point would be of including that in the prologue of the next book if it doesn't come back around. Obviously it was included for some reason or other, and I hope to find out why whenever I can get my hands on book 2.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the relationship build up with Katsa and Po and I liked how they completely complement each other. However, this is where I consider Katsa's independence to be a fault. I just personally have a hard time relating to someone who is so opposed to marriage. And while I understand that once she frees herself from Randa's control she feels the urgency of remaining in control even more so than before. But couldn't it be said that to allow the events of the past that have made her feel out of control to hinder her from marriage is truly to allow those events to remain in control of her life? Whereas going ahead with marriage and submission would be ultimately taking control--particularly because she knows Po would never try to control her? The thing is, I can see her point of view. I just don't agree with it. (Please don't mistake me and think that I believe every book or love story should end with the pretty bow tying everything up with matrimony. I just struggle with Katsa being so opposed to the idea. Especially because...um...well it's Po!)<br /><br />I also think it's truly ironic that the two things she thought she'd never want or need is exactly what she ended up with. She never wanted to be in love and never wanted to be a mother. While it's true that at the conclusion of this book she was not actually married or a mother, she fell in love and she had to take a child into her sole care and responsibility (for a time anyway) and make sure that child survived and she did it voluntarily and quite well if you ask me. Her motherly instincts definitely came through at multiple points in the story.<br /><br />Summing it up...Katsa was a strong, gifted character that ended up with exactly what she thought she didn't want. I enjoyed the love story as per usual. However, the ending left me wanting more, and I'm not sure I can quantify that as the good kind of wanting. I am excited to read Fire whenever I can get my hands on it, but for now I must be satisfied and move on. What do you guys think? Have any of you read Graceling? I'd definitely recommend it.mming it up...Katsa was a strong, gifted character that ended up with exactly what she thought she didn't want. I enjoyed the love story as per usual.

B000IZA9NU|5.0|Somehow I had missed this Star Trek offering. When browsing for an Amazon Prime movie, I saw the description, and decided to give it a try. It did not disappoint; in fact, I was very impressed with the movie, and it reaffirmed my deep-down trekkie nature...<br /><br />Star Trek embodies an idealism and purity that I can only wish we humans had in real life. This may be a morality tale, a metaphoric scolding addressed to those who exploit others today...So be it. If we need to be chastised, I can think of few more pleasant ways for that to happen.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|After reading some of the reviews, I was nervous about ordering this product, but on a leap of faith I did it. It arrived in 3 days and it was in PERFECT condition. It had the plastic wrapping around the case and the box wasn't damaged at all. It looks really nice actually. All of the discs were there and none of them were scratched. I've already watched half of the series and I haven't encountered any skipping. The packaging of the discs themselves is great. The booklets are really well made. It doesn't bother me that they aren't seperated by season at all. I like that each book has a picture of the character at the beginning of the show and then a picture of them at the end of the show. The book is really nice with lots of pictures and an episode description for every disc. I would definitely recommend this item to a friend. I would have spent double the price for this item.

B008469DGY|5.0|{Reviewed on a Kindle Fire}<br /><br />Take a break and flick the ball on far prettier courses than the standard driving range.<br /><br />Details:<br />-Each \\"course\\" is a single tee overlooking one landscape (no going tee to tee on the same course). However after each drive, the green moves to another part of the location. One might aim at a green straight ahead for a short drive, then shoot from the same tee to a new green farther away to the left.<br />-The scenic locales and graphics are top notch. They vary across the globe from regular tree-lined green courses to a desert to ocean cliffs and more. There are seven main locations and two bonus ones.<br />-Each green has rings around it. One scores more points for landing the ball on the closest ring to the hole, starting at 200 up to a hole-in-one for 1000. An absolutely perfect shot landing in the hole without a bounce is 3000 points. Hit multiple holes-in-one in a row to get higher and higher bonus points. Points are also scored for hitting the pin or a technical bonus for perfect aim, not needing any spin. Points are lost for landing in the water or bunker hazards.<br />-Each drive is a simple flick; stronger flicks equal more distance. However the drive is proportional to the distance to the green. The same strength flick will overshoot a short green or a long green.<br />-Whenever in the air, even up to a third bounce, flick left or right to spin the ball. Flick down to apply backspin and up for topspin. The more flicks or stronger flicks, the stronger the spin. Each spin gives bonus points that increase for the stronger spins. Applying really strong spins grants bonuses that rival a hole-in-one's score.<br />-Each hole may have a wind gauge shifting the drive left or right.<br />-There are three modes. In each mode, beat a target score to unlock the next course. Three score levels are set to award a bronze, silver, or gold trophy beside the course name. There is a hidden special award for a really high score.<br />-Quickshot mode gives a timer and multiple shots to score as high as possible. Add three seconds for landing in the inner 500 point red zone closest to the hole. Add ten seconds for a hole-in-one. Drives are available until the timer reaches zero. However if the timer hits zero during a drive before the ball stops, time is added back if the shot was good. The wind increases the longer you play.<br />-World Circuit mode has only nine shots at a location, but it is not timed. Every three holes, the green moves further away and the wind increases.<br />-Quickshot Pro mode is a far tougher challenge with less time than Quickshot and stronger winds.<br />-The game tracks scores and various statistics. There are also buttons for additional features that are not currently available, such as a world leader board. Hopefully there will be a future update to add them.<br /><br />Overall this is a quick scenic way to go finger golfing on beautiful courses. I find myself playing with the mentality of \\"just one more hole because I can beat that score.\\" Hours pass but with extreme satisfaction.
1932735410|5.0|I did what the book said and I passed on my first try.  I read the PMBOK 4th Edition once.  I read Rita's book 3 times and did the questions at the back of each chapter 3 or more times.  Additional questions, such as those advertised in the book will help.  I scored below proficient in initiating and closing sections (the areas where there are the least number of questions on the PMP exam) and moderately proficient in the planning, executing, and monitoring and controlling sections.  I will admit that working in project management helped.  That's a prerequisite for sitting for the exam anyway.<br /><br />Best Regards in passing on your first try.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|As a literature instructor and avid reader of fiction and romance, this is THE first time I've actually stopped mid way into a book due to physical nauseau. Besides that fact that I agree with most reviews that the wording is childish and the sex scenes are unbelievable, the fact that a young girl is masochistic and feels the need to please a billionaire by being his pet slave is disgusting. What kind of message does this heroine send to young women reading it? As a survivor of an abusive relationship, this brought back memories of control and oppression that I never want to experience again, even in a fictional novel.

B0086700CM|5.0|this app is so amazing its addicticting and fun! anyone who says its not obviously is just a gayer so don't listen to them if you get this game you will not regret it! plus its free so why not try it?
B0064T6LV8|5.0|This app is really worth the FREE price if you're a pinball fan.  The graphics are top notch and the sound is good.  The physics are realistic and the option to change the view is a great bonus.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game for a long time. I was so excited when I saw this. so thank you
B0086700CM|5.0|works great on the kindle and its super fun and addictive!! the best free game yet. no annoying ads &lt;3
B007SYWFRM|5.0|Ice Age Village is a great game for hours of fun that you can get hooked in to tot many hours
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a really fun game some of the games are boring but to me at least 95 percent of them are fun.
B0012909NQ|5.0|Regardless of which era of Genesis you enjoy, this show was a treat to watch.  It is a great combination of the progressive 70's songs and the more mainstream 80's songs, including some of the longer 80's ones like \\"Home by the Sea\\" and \\"Domino.\\"  Musically they all are at the top of their game, although there are times you feel like the bass needs turned up a bit, but I think part of their m.o. is to keep the keyboards pretty dominate.  Apart from surperb musicianship, what really sets this show apart is the lighting.  I've not seen much to compare with this.  It is a spectacular addition to the music, doesn't overwhelm it, but complements it.  My only disappointment was a small edit in \\"The Cinema Show\\" where they jump forward about 20 seconds and skip a small section, and that skipped part I felt is one of the most dramatic portions of the entire song.  The transition takes you off guard because you're waiting for the next part and it jumps past it.  But, beyond that, no complaints, and the documentary is fantastic, giving us a look into what it takes to get a tour like this together.  May want to watch it first before letting younger kids watch it because there is some profanity.  All in all, if you are a fan of Genesis, you'll not be disappointed.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love Temple Run.It's a game of skill and charisma.This app is my favorite.I am going to recommend this app to my friends.
B007BZM30M|5.0|If you are looking for a song that features deep, thought-provoking lyrics or superb vocals, then Call Me Maybe is not the song for you. But if you're looking for a ridiculously catchy pop song that is guaranteed to put a smile on your face, then look no further. Sure, the lyrics are silly and repetitive, but who really cares when you've got such an infectious tune?<br /><br />In short, there are plenty of other options if you're looking for more meaningful music. Sometimes, however, you just need to hear something light and fun. If you accept this song for what it is--one of the catchiest songs to come along in quite some time--there's no way you won't enjoy it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I don't like this game!&iexcl;!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#@? hi ppl hello hola its ok.  but ya know I'm 12 and its kinds boring
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Wonderful game; hours of fun. there are lots of levels and some can be very challenging. I would highly recommend this game to any one from 2 to 200 Years old.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I read the first one in 2 days but it took me 2weeks to read this one. although this is a good book, it goes slower than what i like and takes a long time to get to the point. ' The Hunger Games' jumped right into the excitement after about 50-100 pages whereas it took over 200 pages to get to the excitement. This is a good book just not the best one in the series. the only reason i really kept reading thjs book is because of Finnick Odair.  I am really looking forward to seeing this movie and the Mockingjay movie as well. Suzanne Collins is an excellent writer!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love the game. It is great but the energy system is annoying, also I'd prefer it to ACTUALLY be free.
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|i am reading the series again and i don't know if i want read it again. i think this book is the most depressing even though the whole series is about 24 teens killing each other for entertainment.<br />SPOILER START<br /> The fact that peeta gets so hurt that he thinks Katniss is a Mutt just makes me sick.y  would anyone do that to him? SPOILER END<br />anyone who likes a sad love/thriller novel, this book would be good for you. but let me tell you, i cried the first half of this book. although i didn't like the book, i am looking forward to the movie ( not that it will be any better. ;) )
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Wasn't expecting much from this but it puts a very serviceable edge on a blade. Won't get \\"razor\\" sharp but it'll get sharper than you'll need for pretty much any realistic task. Brought a few old chef's knives back to life nicely.
B007SGM084|2.0|I can't believe I had to read through 3 books to find a plot.  This book is so over-sexualized that it becomes boring and tedious to read.  The last book was the best because at least it had some action.<br />The main female character comes off as weak and whiny.  I really don't know how these books are #1 NY Times best-sellers.  If it is just smut you are after, find a book with a better plot.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is a great game I love it and play it all the time. It is probably my favorite app on my entire device. I highly recommend this game to anyone.
B004O3YGMC|4.0|I've been using this app steady for the past 3 weeks. It works great any time I need to access my Quad-Core at home. Mostly I use it to play Lord of Ultima. No issues with Verizon 3G in my area. Droid X2
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|title says it all. easily a five star ap for what it does especially with Skitch added. it does everything I need it to do and for free.
B007KQ6XYY|5.0|Both cut the rope games are great games! They run smooth, great interface, and are addictingly fun! Definently worth 1$. But please come out with more and harder levels.
B007NESBK2|5.0|This in one great concert.  Sade looks and sounds awesome.  The band accompanying her is top notch.  These guys are true musicians.  This Blu-Ray is a must have for Audiophiles to demo their system.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|Would like more challenge!  Good graphics and downloaded quickly.  Just way too simple.  Lists on sideboard are too large so it is distracting.
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Dar...Oh sorry I got mixed, this isn't that ordinary sitcom called How I met your mother, this is actual humor.<br />So, if you've seen Community, you'll want to buy it and if you haven't, well, you've got two days to see it before your execution.
B0086700CM|5.0|good game for being free. would actually pay to get this app if they ever made it not free. thanks for putting it on the kindle
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is fun and its free. I really like this game and its easy to play. I had no problems
B0028AQLYE|5.0|Makes me feel much more comfortable when swimming laps. I'm not a strong swimmer and this provides assurance of no water in the snorkel

B0063IH60K|5.0|I love that you can customize your own background in this game!! the game works perfectly as well,  haven't had a problem with it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was so exited when I was searching for a hockey game and at the top of the list it is there.I was jelous of my friends that they could play it on their ipods and ipads and I could not play it.I can not stop playing it.Greatest game ever
B003UESJ9M|1.0|The acting wasn't exactly bad, but the plot was very dull.  The characters are hollow and lifeless so you never invest in them.  Nothing really happens in the movie that's interesting and it's so boring, you really don't care.  You could get up in the middle of it and miss 30 minutes, come back, and still know exactly what's going on.  Boring plot, boring characters, boring everything.  Skip this movie please!  I wish I had.
B004SYP5WC|4.0|This app has been a great extra reminder to me and has saved me from being late more than once! Easy to set up and use - I recommend it!
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so glad that they finally put the real temple run on the app store. I was getting so sick of all the stupid fake temple run apps. they were dumb and immature to make people buy the fake ones.enough about me I just wanted to say HOW HAPPY I AM!!!!
B0086700CM|3.0|I hate that it has a whole bunch of gliches in it but other than that it is a fantastic game. you should get it

B005LAIHSQ|3.0|MOVIE REVIEW #35 : \\" Snow White and the Huntsman \\"<br /><br />Making his directorial debut, Rupert Saunders takes a long look at one of the very first original Grimm's Brothers fairy tales and tries hard to give it a new spin. Evan Daugherty (Killing Season), Hassien Amini (Drive, Jude) and also writer/director John Lee Hancock (The Blind Side, The Rookie) try and give the script a new modernized twist from original story. Unfortunately it moves very slowly and goes nowhere and often leaves you wondering where they are actually taking you next. I can see why this film pushed back its release date a couple times.<br /><br />Of course the visuals are interesting and detailed, the costumes clever and inventive and cinematography almost gothic in nature - but the bottom line - the story takes a while to become one - an actual story. There's a new spin on everything from the `magic mirror', the poison apple and even the forest animals and fairies. (Which were the most visually stimulating for the eye!)<br /><br />Now casting must have been a tough one, but given that she didn't have a whole lot to do (or say), Kristen Stewart (Twilight, Into The Woods) gives a somewhat subdued performance in a fairly dark film. As does Chris Hemsworth (Star Trek-2009, Thor) who is the Huntsman on a somewhat altered mission from the original tale. And, the two of them did not seem to connect - `chemically' for me.<br /><br />Charlize Therone (Monster. Hitchcock) plays the `evil' Witch. Now although she was extremely expressive in her desire to be evil - she wasn't looking like she enjoyed what she was doing. Bitter and spiteful and not evil for the sake of being evil, Therone didn't seem like she was having any fun with a role that didn't have to be over-the-top - but at least interesting enough to make me believe she loved and desired to do what she was doing.<br /><br />For me, the stand out performances came from the smaller but poignant characters - like Bob Hoskins (Who Framed Roger Rabbit, Hook)play one of the eight dwarfs who is blind. His words of wisdom and `insight' actually explain and drive the story when things actually started happening. Also, Sam Spruell (The Hurt Locker, Defiance) play the evil Witch's brother who seems to deviously delight in his quest to find Snow White after she runs into the dark forest. Fighting and re-fighting Hemsworth many times.  Both Bob and Sam are engaging to watch when they are on screen. Sam Claflin (Pirates of the Caribbean 4, Untied) played a long acquainted childhood friend of Snow's who really made a connection with his duel mission as directed by the evil Queen.<br /><br />Another plus for me was the representation of the Black Forest. Extremely creepy and true to the Brothers Grim original tale, the imagination of the forest attacking a person became visually scary. Also, the beauty and grace of the hidden forest, the forest animals inside this area and especially the fairies that occupied the plants, trees and animals = were quite stunning to watch. The special effects have come a long way to making the fantasy seem very real.<br /><br />Overall...it is a long film, that is short of moving the story along and long on fighting and action sequences of hand to hand and horse to horse combat. The relationships have a new twist to them and be prepared to get a new really big twist on this old tale at the end of the film.<br /><br />Definitely a family friendly film, however a little weak in the story and characterization department - I would wait for the DVD, online or rent it - Snow White didn't have the passion I was expecting.Rabbit, Hook)play one of the eight dwarfs who is blind.

B0086700CM|5.0|it took you ling enough to get it for the kindle lol but I still love it its so addicting
B0086700CM|5.0|I love Temple Run!!!!! Ive been waiting forever! I'm really glad! Any age should be able to play. Its really fun! Also, its very addictive. Anyone who sees this app shouldn't hesitate. Hope u enjoy!!!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|love this app. fun to try and beat each others score! just share with people with you. great way to get your points up
B0086700CM|5.0|love it!! it is so addictive!! I almost don't want to put it down but I know I have to
B004HZ76FQ|4.0|This is a pretty fun and addicting game.  If you want a good time killer this is a good app to get.  My girlfriend and I always compete of who can catch the biggest fish.  Just becareful and don't fling your phone across the room or into your forehead.  In order to cast your reel you have to fling it like you are fishing and one day I flinged it really hard, I lost my grip and the phone slammed into my forehead.  Not only that I lost my fish off the hook.  Anyways this is a fun game to play and I don't even like fishing in real life either.
0553801473|2.0|Just like a fish, I was hooked with the first three books and now I'm writhing in pain, just trying to get away. The last two parts, including \\"A Dance With Dragons,\\" have failed to capture my imagination like the series originally did. The books have morphed into the \\"Oregon Trail\\" game. It just feels like Martin is walking in circles to nowhere, moving in slow motion, gradually killing off every core character in the process. Unfortunately, just like thousands (or perhaps millions) of others, I'll still probably purchase the final books, just so I don't feel like I've completely wasted my time reading the others. I fear by the end, though, just like all of Martin's characters, I will have died of dysentery.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|This game works great on the HTC Evo 4G.  It is very action packed and fast paced.  It's very fun, addicting, and a great time killer.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was so shocked to see the real temple run on the amazon app store! it also has a lot of glicthes.
B0086700CM|5.0|I think this game is the 2nd best game on any de<br />vice. It has the best graphics ever. That is my review of Temple Run.
B0086700CM|4.0|its good but it seems to go slower and you cant really go for too long. also buffers a bit... still fun though.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|I wish I had this app long time ago.  I gives a very good snapshot of your wireless performance and what's available within your range.  I already moved my router to a different channel for better performance.
B0086700CM|5.0|I was so excited to see Temple Run as the daily free app! I had played it on an iPad before. It's totally addicting!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|Very fun. Kills a lot of time. Great design of app, easy to use. This is very highly recommended for all ages.
0439023491|1.0|I'm going to keep this short because there are not enough words to describe how bad this book is.<br /><br />The first book was ok. This book is dire. The writing is absolutely horrendous. Repetitive, over explanatory and simple minded. I am not a writer so don't compare the English that I am using to the English that this author uses. But I am a reader. And I can clearly say that this book was embarrassingly bad.<br /><br />I feel sorry for teenagers and kids reading this book and the Twilight series and having this level of English absorbed into their brains. Society tries to encourage kids to read but I discourage anyone to read this.<br /><br />Read the back of a shampoo bottle in the bathroom instead.
B0086700CM|1.0|all this game did was glitch and so guy ran off the ruins because for some reason I downloaded this on my kindle obviously not compatible software. if you have a kindle don't waste your time. I was hummed it looked like a fun game.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|Bought Hunger Games Trilogy download for<br />grandchild's Kindle, so I read it too.<br /><br />Volume I. Good reading<br /><br />Volume II. Levelled out.<br /><br />Volume III. Crashed and burned.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|I loved this entire series! The story line was fantastic and made the series not just about sex...I absolutely loved it!!!
B0063GORYU|4.0|I like the challenge - more as you play all 4 suits. The only set back are the adds that pops each time you start a game.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Hi everyone<br /><br />Just finished Wool Omnibus 1-5 and had a great experience. Looking forward to more of Hughs work.  A great book always creates images and feelings directly in my mind without the sensation of reading.  It is like a virtual reality or video game experience that cocoons around you.  Wool did this.  I found myself almost holding my breath during the underwater scenes.  I hope Ridley Scott considers this for a movie.<br /><br />Thanks Hugh<br />Keep up the excellent work.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Very fun game lots to do and the goals are easily achieved. Its also addicting! I like that the game is easy but still challenging enough to keep interest.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game.I played this game on my brother's Ipod and I loved it.Now it's on the kindle fire. I play it every single day.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I loved reading this book. I just finished the Fifty Shades triolgy and discovered I like these romantic books. This book reminded me of the movies Fight Club and 21 but romantic.
0345803485|1.0|Wow, what a waste of time!  Written worse than the most juvenile harlequin romance.  Laughable sex scenes- not sure how anyone except the most vanilla, sexually inexperienced or repressed person could think this is hot.  I agree with the other reviewer- I would swear this was written by a fantasizing adolescent.  Want my money back.  And time.
B00004Z4SD|5.0|This movie is so sad, but it has a wonderful story. First time I seen this, I was totally touch. And of course some amazing actors and actresses. I love this movie. I totally recommend this to anyone.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|There really are no other words except guilty pleasure. This book is so entertaining, definite page turner.  Look- you aren't going to be any smarter after you read this book but you sure will be a little more outgoing in the bedroom!
B0086700CM|5.0|Lots of fun, simple game. Be sure to go to the shop and get upgrades and new characters, I didn't know you could do that for forever. All the money you spend is earned in game, it's not actual money. Unless of course you really really want to spend actual money to buy a bunch of coins. (Can't see why you would). Go ahead, try it, it's free, you can't go wrong!!!
B002GJT4XW|5.0|I decided to start collecting all of my favorite movie series on Blu Ray such as Lord of the Rings, Star Wars, and Harry Potter and after looking at several Blu Ray releases I was most interested in the Ultimate Editions. I bought and watched this first Ultimate Edition and for everything it comes with, it is worth the money. The movie looks fantastic on Blu Ray and sounds great. The \\"Creating the World of Harry Potter\\" disc is the best part of this Edition. Each of these editions comes with a new part of Creating the World.. It comes with 2 character cards which actually are not of much use. It also comes with a Creating the World of Harry Potter booklet which isnt bad, It contains alot of movie and production stills with captions as to what they are. Absolutely worth the money, I highly recommend it.
2070364232|5.0|very simple to read for beginners in french<br />fun stories in it!! great book<br /><br />igave it as a gift ro my brother who also studies french as i do, and the first day we read it togheter and we couldnt stop reading it, we were obsessed with it.<br />I cant wait to buy another of the books from the author.<br />100%recommended
B002GJT4YQ|5.0|Really excellent buy. After the first one worked out so well I had to get the 2nd Ultimate Edition. Once again the picture and sound quality is beautiful and the extras are fascinating. \\"Creating the World of Harry Potter Part 2\\" Covers characters and one of the best extras so far. Highly recommend for any Harry Potter Fan. If you are just someone who only cares about the movie and nothing else then this would probably be a waste, but this product is to appeal highly to hardcore, collector, and all other Harry Potter fans who simply love the franchise.
B0086700CM|4.0|I really enjoy the game and I had been greatly anticipating for the time this would release on the Kindle Fire. I have to say it's as good as I expected, but it frequently skips in framerate. It's nothing big, but it bugs me a little. Nevertheless, it's a great game.
0345803485|1.0|After so much hype and constant recommendations I finally got around to reading this.<br />Sherri Shepherd even featured this very book on 'The View' as one of her favorite things!<br />Firstly, let me tell you that I am not a writer so I am not in any shape or form even remotely talented enough to write a novel. Yes, I pretty much suck at writing, story building, imagining etc. BUT, I COULD HAVE WRITTEN A BETTER BOOK THAN 'FIFTY SHADES OF GREY'!!!!<br /><br />This book was written so badly that I can only guess the author is a horny teenager who's put what she \\"thinks\\" sex is like on paper.<br />Anastasia's experiences with sex are NOT possible in the real world. It is RIDICULOUS how this girl, who may I add is a virgin in the beginning of this book, can climax and reach the height of an orgasm at the touch of her goddamn fingernail by this man!!!<br />Christian Grey is suppose to be the man of every woman's dreams. YEAH RIGHT!! More like the worst nightmare! Who wants a man who controls you, HURTS YOU and bosses you around? Not me!<br />His fetish is disgusting. Maybe some people prefer it that way, but I can't even stomach it. I prefer my books to have some sensuality, passion, LOVE(???). This book is lacking in all!<br />This author has gained so much popularity, for this? I cannot believe it!<br />Anastasia acts like a teenager with no experience or brains! She seemed so stupid to me.<br /><br />Girls, if a man you don't know makes you an offer to become his sex slave you RUN!!! You run the other way and never look back!!! You get a restraining order against him! You DO NOT agree to it! GODDDDD!!! What a dumb girl this Anastasia is!<br /><br />I know a lot of people loved this book. I am not one of them. I did not see the love.<br />Ana blushes a million times, chews on her lips a trillion times(I was surprised she still had any lips left on her after all that chewing, it can not be healty!) and flutters her eyelashes a gazillion times.<br />Did this book havean editor? Hell, even I could have edited it down. But then only oh about 40 pages would be left of the book.<br />It seems like this is something that had been posted to fan fiction sites and by some miracle was published.<br /><br />'Fifty shades of grey' is more like a nightmare. Read at your own risk. Don't tell me I didn't warn you folks! I still have a bad aftertaste of this book. Disgusting!
B0086700CM|5.0|its the best game ever very addicting I recommended it for everybody. finally came out for kindle fire.  so excited
B00785P2QC|4.0|love the game but requires too many city credits tobuy things.<br />some places on the map are very difficult to get too.
B0086700CM|5.0|it is such an addicting and amazing game....I have water and water for this game to come on the kindle......it has the same graphics as the ipad and ipod....and any other thing I liv it and hope u do to!!!!!!
B0086T77MG|1.0|I ordered Season 2 of Sherlock. I did not order a 9-minute special that is available free on YouTube. I guess I'm going to have to cancel all my season passes from Amazon, since I can't trust them to only sell me actual episodes of a program.
B005UBNKZG|5.0|Great cpu for the price, multitasking is great and start up and opening programs are nearly instant, games run great. Paired this with a HD 7850 Xfire and all games run at 70fps +, crysis 2, arkham city, NFS Hot pursuit, Skyrim and others, and this processor is not even breaking a sweat, have never seen it go past 20% CPU usage in task manager, even while running a game, also runs at a  very cool temperature. Would highly recommend this product, huge bang for the buck.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game I checked every day for it to come out and now I play it everyday it is amazing
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|love this game! works great on my kindle fire!! I have it for about a month and ive had no problems at all.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I so enjoyed reading the 'reviews' of this book that I can only wish the two writers would get together and , uh, write a book of reviews of 'bad books'.... I would read it.  Regarding the single book from the 'trilogy' they reviewed, I trust their perceptions so much on this one, that I will never read it.  Never give it as a gift to ANYONE and never buy a copy at a book sale to prop up a table leg.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great app. easy to use and fast on the results. great memory feature. I intend to send it to lots of friends
B0086700CM|5.0|I just barely got this and I have only been playing this it is so adictive. you have to get this no matter what.
0525478817|5.0|The characters were so well-drawn, the voices of Hazel and Augustus (and their parents) so true!  I'll never forget this book!  I don't read many books twice, but I will read this one again.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game it has so many fun things to do. The only thing I would recommend is the food to be cooked faster. other than that this app is great best game of all the other story games I played.
B0086700CM|5.0|I actually hadn't heard of Temple Run until I stumbled acrossed it in app store. There were so many reviews on how much fun it was that I couldn't resist the urge to test it out. Out of the 48 hours I've had it, 30 of them have probably been spent playing this game.  I really enjoy playing and I think a lot more people  will too...
1442413611|4.0|The Dealer is the second in the Cherub series and  I enjoyed it just as much the first book, The Recruit.  The protagonists are teens trained by MI5 to work as spies, infiltrating businesses and helping the adult spies take down the bad guys.  Along with the action and adventure, there is teen behavior such as a bit of romance (real and imagined) and poor choices which lead to danger.  This title follows four Cherubs as they work to gather information about a drug lord and to do so, the teens allow themselves to be recruited by the drug lord to be couriers.  Unfortunately, one Cherub takes drugs and is thus dismissed from the team and another teen who is tempted by drugs.  An exciting book which will draw in both girls and boys, particularly those who enjoyed the Alex Rider series.  Thanks to Puget Sound Council for this review copy.
B0017WCERM|1.0|I was excited to pick up a copy of this for a good price from a local music store only to take it home, open it up, and listen to it and find out that it was pressed like crap. Right out of the wrappping the record skipped all over the place, my guess is it was produced poorly, and i have super dirty, old records that don't even do this. An amazing album of course, but if you want it on vinyl i would stick to the original pressing.
B005FVNJTS|4.0|A perfect book for any athlete wanting to take there game to another level.

B0044XV3QY|5.0|The collectors extended edition of Avatar is really quite impressive.  The extra footage really adds to the depth of the characters and the story overall, And the video quality takes bluy ray to a whole new level.  I haven't yet seen a blu ray movie with the video quality that this edition of Avatar has, it looks absolutely awesome!  This edition of the movie is definitely worth the price.

B000V8A31C|5.0|I've had this score for years, and it never fails to lift my spirits. It's melodic, moving, and wonderfully recorded. Jean-Yves Thibaudet is a marvel to listen to.
B001CJJWJ8|5.0|This review appeared in the earlier recording which is no longer available. Now that the previous recording has been reissued I wanted to resubmit this review as I believe this recording, due to the blood curdling Grand Inquisitor/Phillip II duet, to be  likely the most satisfying:<br /><br />In general agreement with all the above reviews, I would like to go one step further and add another dimension to what has already been said.<br />  First of all, this is likely to be the finest Don Carlo ever recorded. I've not heard every one of the available recordings, but I've heard most of them and this one surpasses them all!<br />  For many decades Don Carlo was cast aside as an inferior work and had to wait for Rudolph Bing to pull it out of obscurity by mounting a production at the Met in the 60's. It now enjoys the success it rightly deserves. Don Carlo has ALL the ingredients that make Verdi, Verdi: The theme of father-child relationship, his contempt for the clergy, a show stopping role for dramatic soprano (Eboli) which he invented, his admiration for the the common man and the downtrodden, the sexual taboos of the time, and much of his best music written for not one, not two, but three bass baritones!<br />  The other reviews have unanimously stated that Dietrich Fischer-Diskau is entirely miscast as Rodrigo. Fisher-Diskau did have a perfect voice for German lieder, and was in no way a Verdi baritone but the role of Rodrigo is different from the other baritone roles of the Verdi repetoire. Rodrigo, is a super good guy, obsessed with liberating the downtrodden Flemish from Spanish oppression. The light, lyrical quality of F-D's baritone voice provides a superb contrast with Ghiarov's deep, Russian bass who brilliantly portrays an unequaled interpretation of the stubborn, ultra conservative and stupid king Phillip. Rodrigo also does a lot of male bonding with Carlo and Fischer-Diskau's lyrical baritone voice blends exquisitely with the sweet sound of Bergonzi's tenor. So, while I agree that Fischer-Diskau should have avoided the darker Verdi baritone roles, this is one where he has been ideally cast.<br />  Also stated in the previous reviews is the fact that Tebaldi is at the end of her career and her voice sounds a bit pushed. True enough, but once again, pushed or not, Tebaldi is strong, on pitch and I find her older voice to be entirely appropriate here! She and Carlo fall in love, but she is also his stepmother (an important element of the plot)! That Tebaldi's voice is older only makes her that much more believable as Elisabeta.<br />  As Eboli, Bumbry leaves me breathless! Her voice is young and rings with brilliance also providing the perfect contrast to Tebaldi's older sound. When she flirts with Rodrigo she is a 'coquette', but when she becomes a woman scorned, she crackles with red hot rage!<br />  Already mentioned is Nicolai Ghiarov. Russia has always been known for producing the greatest basses on earth and Ghiarov is the best of the best! His interpretation of 'Ella giammai m'amo' will move you to tears.<br />  Martti Talvela sings an unequaled grand Inquisitor. In every other recording I've heard the Grand Inquisitor's sound is too pretty....but Talvela gives us something dark, evil and terrifying. The scene between Phillip and the Grand Inquisitor, two Verdian basses, will curdle your blood! Anyone interested in seeing how blood curdling it is for me, look at my illustrations of this scene by visiting my website at [artbyelguera.com.] Click on the category for 'illustrations'. This recording is what inspired these illustratations.<br />  All in all, this is the definitive Don Carlo. Worth all five stars. Absolutely worth the price!<br />  Please take a look at my fully illustrated opera librettos in graphic novel form available exclusively at The Metropolitan Opera Gift Shop and here on Amazon:[[ASIN:1450724140 The Fully Illustrated Libretto of Puccini's Madama Butterfly]][[ASIN:1450765807 The Fully Illustrated Libretto of Ravel's L'Enfant et Les Sortileges (Librettos)]] [[ASIN:1450765815 The Fully Illustrated Libretto of Gian Carlo Menotti's the Medium]]

0345803485|5.0|I thought this book was very entertaining. I couldn't stop reading it. So what if he was a total fantasy of a man... it's a Story! and a sexy 1 at that. Can't wait to read the rest in this trilogy
B0082JYAZ2|4.0|\\"What We Saw\\" is an excellent continuation of Regina's unique approach to her craft. If you're a fan of her quirks and eccentricities, her guttural stops and starts are still here, although to a lesser extent than is found in the previous efforts \\"Far\\" and \\"Begin to Hope\\". The same could be said about her playfulness at the piano, which appears toned down (reined in?) here as the songs take on a more traditional structure. That's not to say that the songs are flat, each contains Regina's unique vocal delivery. Her vocal impressions (impersonations?) are still abundant. On \\"Far\\" Spektor infamously impersonated a dolphin, but on \\"What We Saw\\" she limits her impersonations to staccato percussion on \\"Oh Marcello\\" as well as on the frantic, rollicking \\"All the Rowboats\\". On \\"The Party\\", Spektor does her best impression of a trumpet.<br /><br />There are several standouts, beginning with the album's opening track, \\"Small Town Moon\\", a song that sounds as if it would easily have been at home on her excellent \\"Begin to Hope\\" album, at least that is until the song changes tone and goes off in a new (and not unpleasant) direction 90 seconds in, before returning. Equally strong are \\"All the Rowboats\\", \\"Ballad of a Politician\\" and \\"Firewood\\", which wasn't originally a favorite of mine until one lyric really stood out. Many songs deal with aging/getting older, and the verse \\"You'll want to go back, You'll wish you were small, Nothing can slow the crying, You'll take the clock off of your wall, And you'll wish it was lying\\" certainly resonates, but it is a preceding line that really conjures up mental images, and it made me smile while listening to it: \\"Someday you'll wake up and feel a great pain, And you'll miss every toy you ever owned\\". Sweet, bittersweet and heartbreaking all at once.<br /><br />\\"How\\" is a delicate, vulnerable post-break-up, how-do-I-go-on-without-you song, a topic that lyrically has been mined to death, but Regina pulls it off spectacularly, and it's one ofmy favorites on the album. Musically, (and thematically, to an extent) the track is reminiscent of Sam Cooke's wonderful \\"Bring it on Home\\". \\"Don't Leave Me (Ne Me Quitte Pas)\\" takes on a decidedly Carribean tone, complete with a marimba, an instument somwhat similar to a xylophone in that it consists of wodden bars struck with mallets. The track easily could find a place on the next Jimmy Buffet album. If there is one song to pass over, it is \\"Oh Marcello\\", which finds Spektor, with her Russian accent, singing in English, affecting a faux Italian accent. It's as messy as it sounds.<br /><br />The album ends with a dramatic departure with \\"Jessica\\". If you're familiar with her excellent \\"Live in London\\" album (and if you're not, you should be!), you'll know it ends with a twangy, countrified \\"Love you're a Whore\\", which really stood apart from the 21 other tracks on the album. \\"Jessica\\" is as radically a depature from the rest of \\"What We Saw\\" as \\"Love is a Whore\\" is on \\"Live in London\\". It is a simple, stark closer, gone is Spektor's trademark piano, replaced with an acoustic guitar. It's a fine song, but at less than 2 minutes long it doesn't resonate too heavily.<br /><br />If there is one complaint, and I do feel it is a valid one, is that the album is FAR too brief. At 11 tracks, the album clocks in at a paltry 37 minutes. Of the 11 tracks, 5 of them fail to crack the 3-minute mark. Not that song/album length dictates quality, but the inability to extend songs beyond two-and-a-half minutes leaves many of the songs feeling incomplete or not fully fleshed out. Many could use another verse to fully explore the ideas, particularly \\"Ballad of a Politician\\" which just leaves you wanting more. Regina gave an excellent interview, where she stated she has \\"dozens and dozens and dozens\\" of old tunes banging around. She went on to say \\"I always had this feeling like there's a giant pile of songs and they're all waiting for their turn to be worked on, to be cared for, andbe noticed\\". Regina began her career using free studio time given to her by a friend. Being Jewish, Regina recorded snippets of songs on Christmas day, a time when the studio wasn't booked. Due to time contraints, often tracks were recorded in a single take, so it's because of this Regina has felt a compulsion to revisit her back-catalogue. She has repeatedly gone \\"back to the well\\" and revisited songs from her past (see \\"Samson\\" from Begin to Hope which originally appeared on the album \\"Songs\\" as well as \\"What We Saw's\\" \\"Don't Leave Me\\" which was also found on \\"Songs\\"). It is precisely because of this fact (Regina's claims to have a backlog of songs, as well as her willingness to re-visit older material) that \\"What We Saw's\\" brevity is so frustrating. If you're a fan, you'll want MORE, and will be left feeling that \\"What We Saw from the Cheap Seats\\", while being a worthy effort, is somehow incomplete.
B005LAIH4A|3.0|This movie is good for kids. It has HOLLYWOOD written all over it. Be prepared for a \\"BAD\\" song in the middle. Pretty decent movie though. Be prepared for some wackiness. The only reason I saw this movie was because Taylor Swift acted in it.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is appsolutely OUTSTANDING! For months my grandma has had this app on her IPad, and I was reeeeeaaallllyy jealous!<br /><br />Sooooo...You may ask? What did I do?<br /><br />I playing it for four hours straight... Literally.<br /><br />Well...<br /><br />I guess you could say until she made me homemade pancakes.<br /><br />Anywhoo, this app is my DREAM! When I<br />saw this was in the app store, I nearly cr*pped my pants, woke up my neighbors, and my 9 week old puppy... Sorry Dixie! :) I love the features and everything!! This is the perfect app! No doubt about it for sure! This is a great time wasted and I love the options in the store! Honestly, there is nothing negative about this app! Truly, there isn't! This is amazing! Great job, Imangi!
0345803485|2.0|This literally is the worst book I've ever read. The story is captivating, and the love story is nice enough. The sex scenes, while brutesque, are not the raunchiest things I've read. It can draw you in into the heat between the two lovers.<br /><br />To a point, that is.<br /><br />The poor writing didn't bother me the first half of the book. I noticed it, had a wish for better writing, and moved on. However, after halfway through, it was beginning to be more than I could bear. By the time I was 75% through, I would actually scream out in disgust with the writing. Each time there was a mention of \\"my inner goddess,\\" I would throw my kindle in disgust and had to wait for the moment of hate to pass by before I could read again.<br /><br />It was too much. Despite an interesting plot and good characters, I simply cannot continue in the series.
B0086700CM|5.0|this has been thr best game i have ever played in my life. i hope everyone out there will love this game TEMPLE RUN.
B005LAIIS0|1.0|I expected an action/adventure film with great acting and found myself hoping for it to show up all the way to the end. What a disappointment! The dialogue (90% expletives and profanities) was unbearable, the plot was insufferable, and the purpose was non-existent. The obvious atheist agenda left the viewer with nothing more than an atheist expects to be left with: NOTHING!
B0086700CM|5.0|best app ever no problems butbi wish at the end of a game it would tell u how many coins u have total.
B006IDG2T6|2.0|In general it seems Harris' general point is that I'm not responsible for anything I do, because my great grandparent ate an apple instead of a pear, taking any decisions I make, ultimately out of my hands (unbeknownst to me). Fortunately my grandparents didn't choose to eat the apple, either. Their ancestors killed a woolly mammoth instead of eating a berry, deciding the outcome of the apple/pear decision eons earlier. Lucky for the mammoth killers, that wasn't their fault, either.<br /><br />Harris makes the point that any decision we think we make, we don't really make, for a number of reasons. Either our conscious decisions were predetermined by by our subconscious or our subconscious decisions were preset by physiology or environment. As such, he makes the argument we have no free will. While you can argue down to the atomic level (as he does fairly well) about the factors that play into anyone's decisions, I think his argument misses the point.<br /><br />Free will isn't the ability to make a choice, completely devoid of influence. On the contrary, free will is the ability/opportunity to make decisions *within* your frame of reference. Choosing not to run a red light, because the last time you did you had an accident is not an example of a lack of free will to make the choice. It's bringing biology, physiology, psychology, experience, etc. to bear in *making* the choice.<br /><br />While Harris makes good points, I believe it's a dishonest argument. The read ends up feeling more like a technical/scientific attempt at a common sociological theme - \\"It's not my fault. Don't blame me. I'm not responsible for anything I do.\\" He just takes the argument far beyond the typical, \\"it's society's fault,\\" giving a plethora of \\"excuses\\".
B0086700CM|3.0|This app is fun and all. But when you get up to 100,000 points it starts to freeze and I die. Though you get used to it and now I barely notice it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book starts off and you think they are going to have a amazing relationship the way they are instantly drawn to one another....BUT then it gets weird with the whips chains and hand cuffs!!! Even though it gets a little weird, you still can't put it down! This book just draws you in with curiosity. I thought it was good. I have purchased the next 2 in the series as well. Yes some stuff is very repeatative but it's still worth reading. I got it to see what the hype was all about and I think it was a good purchase.

0470901071|5.0|Todd Lammle is a master craftsman when it comes to writing.  If youve ever read the Cisco press books, you'll likely find that they are all but unreadable.  Mr Lammle speaks in a language that is easy to understand, and fun to read.  I owned the 6th edition and used it to get my CCENT.  I just used this seventh edition to pass my CCNA.  His books are the only ones I would recommend you read.  I've read bits and pieces of most others and found them to be very hard to follow.<br /><br />Mr. Lammle is always willing to lend a helping hand.  He leaves himself widely available to his students via email and his forum.  He is a very dedicated and knowledgeable teacher.  You can not go wrong in picking up a copy of this book.

1451648537|4.0|First of all. thanks to late Steve Jobs for letting the author bring out the real picture of him and how be succeeded in his second innings at Apple. Its a very well written book and has so many details of the life of Steve Jobs as a friends, a father, a entrepreneur and a CEO of Apple.<br />There are lot of things we could learn from Steve, but at the same time we come to face with this person who was so selfish and self centered that he never acknowledged many of the people who helped him be successful. I don't have great respect for him as a person, but as an entrepreneur, he left his mark in a big way.<br />Last but not the least, my biggest take away from the book is that though he was highly successful with the iPod , iPhone and iPad he did not lay down the foundation for the future of Apple. Apple was such a one-man company and that is something that will bring Apple down in the future. He has said in the book that Tim Cook is not a product person, and I don't see how Apple can continue to be innovative in the future. The decisions that Steve took on his own and enforced due to his conviction and vision, is something that cannot be replicated by Tim Cook or any of his successors. Sadly he failed to lay out a framework for Apple to continue to be innovative and execute as it did under him. That would be his biggest failure. I can see Apple doing well for the next 5-10 years, but beyond that I think it would be al downhill. I hope that I am wrong...

B0071XO8RA|5.0|There is not much I can add to the numerous glowing reviews that the Wool collection already has. My main point in reviewing is in hopes of furthering recognition for an indie author who deserves it.<br />Characterization was wonderful, plot truly riveting (lost some sleep with this one, I couldn't stand to put it down,) and execution was flawless. All facets of the book were excellently done. This is a skilled author with a bright future. I've already purchased #6, the prequel, and certainly will not hesitate to buy any other title by this author.<br />Bravo, and keep them coming!
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|I am a big Phantom fan. Read the book, own all 8 movies (1925,1943,1962,1983 TV,1989,1990 TV,1998,2004), & seen Webbers stage play several times back in the 80's in LA. This is the 1st time Phantom's been sequeled, with Robert Englund's Phantom sequel dying in pre-production in the early 90's. I am disappointed to the point of depression after viewing this sequel to Webbers stage version (NOT movie version). Love Never Dies makes the basic error in sequelling that should be avoided - it changes history. The history change made is that now instead of a Phantom that denied himself \\"the joys of the flesh\\", we have one that had a one night stand with Christine which produced their son!?!? Love Never Dies then goes on to have the classic, traditional Madame Giry, choreograph a strip tease number starring her daughter Meg!?!? She then tries to match the Phantom (who's her age) with her daughter Meg!?!? We also get a Meg that's now infactuated with the Phantom!? A Christine that leaves her drunken bumbling husband Raul for the Phantom!? Musical numbers that aren't even mediocre, & a final end to the debacle with Christine accidentally killed by Meg!!!! Love Never Dies IS the Ultimate propaganda to the original Webber Phantom, doing its best to COMPLETELY DESTROY IT! Unexplainably, it's made by the SAME person???
B0063IH60K|4.0|Downloaded for my kindle fire. Nice way to spend some free time and relax. Easy to use and nice to go back and finish.
0547258305|4.0|I thought Graceling was an interesting story and well written for the most part. I liked most of the book except the ending. I felt that the author rushed through the last six chapters. I thought the characters were interesting. I really liked Po, Bitterblue and Katsa. Katsa is an interesting character: headstrong, smart, resourceful and independent. Bitterblue is my favorite though. My favorite part of the book is the journey through the mountains that Bitterblue and Katsa take.
B0038AL7EW|1.0|The 1star review is not for the movie itself, but rather, the disc itself.  It was broken, and couldn't get to watch the movie.  I know it was used, but it had a fairly big scratch, and was bad enough that it couldn't be read by the player.  I had to send it back.
B006LQQ1GE|5.0|The CD was just as described.  It arrived when stated and in great condition.  The music is wonderful.  I recommend this CD.  Enjoy!!!!!
0307891372|3.0|Content is fine but the spine was partially split and the whole thing reeked of cigarette smoke. Should have bought new.
B007MDQW3W|5.0|Unfortunately, another review stated that this album takes us back to the Begin to Hope/Soviet Kitsch days, I beg to differ.<br />The unpredictable songwriting style, in songs like Ballad of a Politician, is closer, though more produced (though that is to be expected, since she is signed to a label on this one), to 11:11 and Songs, which, if you have not heard, you need to, because they are Regina stripped down of all the gaudy production, which, as some think, is not a bad thing.<br />All together, this is a promising release, and judging by its performance on online charts, might chart on the billboard 200!<br />I love this album!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|if you are expecting jane austin than dont read this. but if you want a racy love story with lots of sex do read. i loved all three of these books. she does a great job with every part

This is by far the most lightweight headset I have every used. It never sits heavy inside the ear. We cannot use ear buds, besides they are rough on the inner ear surface over time. We can hear more sounds with this set and they stay in place. It is perfect for our needs.

B007NESBK2|5.0|This was watching it on 2 channel:<br />Normally what should be a hallmark performance is marred by some form or primal communication on the first track.<br />Who advises a performer on making the first track a disaster and getting better from there is beyond me.<br />Absolutely horrible!<br />Having said that I fast forwarded through this bit of trauma and enjoyed the balance for the most part.<br />Having most of Sade's music I didn't find the music particularly moving or what I would expect from 24 bit.<br />Its almost like her heart wasn't in it.<br />Now that we have listened to it in 5:1 I can see what the rest of the reviewers are saying and have<br />changed my rating from three to five!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Fun game. I enjoy how fast the game moves. You can actually go fishing and catch fish. Shoot wild animals for food., or just let them roam.
B0073XORCY|4.0|Ian Anderson's Thick as a Brick Two , the follow up to the first classic Tull record, is easily his hardest rocking solo album ever, and you need to go back to Crest of a Knave for the proper band to sound as energetic. In fact, it really should just say Jethro Tull on the cover. Instead we get \\"Jethro Tull's Ian Anderson\\", which one would guess was close enough to pass the name recoginition hurdle in marketing and distrubution. Notably absent is stalwart guitarist  Martin Barre, who is not particularly missed (I hate saying that btw) owing to the youthful shredding power brought in by way of Florian Opahle. The band is quite accomplished and they follow Anderson's directives very well throughout the piece. However the playful improvisation of the seminal first TAAB is reigned in by a series of short pieces linked together. Many of the original themes are sprinkled in thoughout this more stately and deliberate song cycle.<br /><br /> The concept weaves 5 possible historys of one Gerald Bostock, the fictional 8 year old boy who is credited with writing the original lyrics to TAAB1.  In describing these characters, Anderson works in a lot of social commentary, lambasting Gerald the Banker Who \\"treats himself to quality time testing porches and snorting lines\\" while abusing his subordinates and cheating his customers in \\"Banker Bets Banker Wins\\". Gerald the Homeless Man is an abused gay kid who winds up on the streets in Swing it Far and Adrift and Dumbfounded. Anderson wisely gets some vocal assistance singing some the the high notes in parts of this section from a sound alike gent named Ryan O'Donnell. In \\"Old School Song\\" the most overt homage to the original TAAB on the record, Gerald becomes a soldier gung ho and ultimately disillusioned. IEDs do that. Gerald the Preacher and Gerald the ordinary bloke don't get as many minutes of exposition as the first three. Anderson returns to familiar ground humorously critcizing religious TV preachers for the one minute song\\"Give til it Hurts\\".<br /><br />\\"A Change of Horses\\" diverts a bit from the vignette flow, and is of sorts a bit of a sequel within sequel recalling themes from (yes of all songs) Heavy Horses. One can't help wond'ring alound and again if this isn't a calling card to what the new Jethro Tull band will (or has already) become. We shall see.<br /><br />In the summation we get to find out what happens to each character, and possibly reflect a little on our own lot in the process. Listening to the original after the sequel is probably a mistake if want to give this record half a chance. The fire, passion and abandon from the first record is overwhelming in any case. Not to mention young Ians voice is just amazing, and present day Ian strains at times.<br /><br />The deluxe release offers a 5.1 mix, and making of and interview featurettes. There is even one of Anderson doing a reading of the lyrics in front of a shifting screen backgound.  Anderson has a very compelling speaking voice and it is a bit of performance art in its own right.<br /><br /> A damn fine Tull album, by any other name. Recommended.
B0058YPL66|5.0|well I think the comment from ( cliched and boring ) shows what very little people have to do in the very short time we have on planet earth.Being so very negative about a simple tv show is pitiful and I hope you find something to be happy about one day before it's to late.I think the show is a good hearted show,but if you feel so bad about it maybe you could change the channel?

1439127700|5.0|Great read! Interesting on every page. You know these guys have their own opinions about the presidents before them and after them. It is good to see that they let all that slide for the good of America. (Except Carter....a snake in the book). I saw Clinton and Bush the elder do one of their speaking engagements in person. It was quite evident from the give and take and the jokes that they really loved each other. I later saw George W. speak and he said his mother referred to Bill Clinton as his other brother. Read this book. You will enjoy it!

B0086700CM|1.0|Great game if you are a fat democrat socialist who enjoys greatly deepening the national debt margin.  This game offers insight into how to of poem your own concentration camp, and ruin it effectively.

B00338QF0U|5.0|I absolutely could NOT put this book down! A classic thriller with an excellent cast of characters that are vividly developed throughout the story. The unfolding of events was well orchestrated and cleverly swept you along to the next twist in the plot. The ending is a heart stopper! Please may there be a sequel!
B0055SWM08|5.0|This is a great game. It's challenging, without being frustrating and I've not had any problems with it on my Xoom.
B000SEGCRS|5.0|I'm one of those people who dreams of taking really good pictures, the kind of photos my friends would say, \\"Wow!  This is great.\\"  I would like to be the person they beg to travel with because I take great photos...but alas, I'm not that person at all.  However, after reading this book and then going back through one topic at a time and practicing I feel I'll soon be at least good enough to no longer embarrass myself.<br /><br />The writing is clear, funny, and friendly - painless learning I'd call it.  As Scott himself says, it's like having a good friend next to you showing you what to do and why.  No photo-jargon, no overly technical exposition - just tell me what to do with enough description so I understand why and can continue to do it on my own.  I liked this book so much I bought volumes 2, 3, and 4 as well.
B000I8HIR2|4.0|Although this movie had a few boring parts that slowed it down, ill watch this movie over the entire Resident Evil series any day of the week. with the exception of the RE cgi movies. Silent hill followed the game, RE did not.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The last book of the trilogy contains many elements that seem to be taken from the present. I can't help but thinking that all this plot is not just fantasy but may once come true.

B0086700CM|5.0|I just love temple run. Its the best game ever. But I wish we had a better market and it needs to have levels not ongoing. Where are the levels.  Do something about it please. Have a temple day.
B0086700CM|5.0|Finally temple run! I have been waiting since I got my kinfl3 fire for this! Time to run! (; I ha
B0074YVW1G|4.0|Great book, much better than another \\"introvert\\" one that I bought and read recently, which was mainly waffle. Cain's book is well-researched and well-written, though I do take issue with the fact that sshe didn't call out a certain prominent researcher who said that people with blue eyes are more highly reactive sensitives (or something like that). Really? And she didn't think to question him on the fact that he was wiping out whole continents of people, such as Africans and Asians?<br />Apart from that, worth reading.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|I love this app.  It has great music and I honestly never realized how many types of jazz there was until I looked at this.  Over all I rate this app a 5.
0385737955|5.0|Imagine yourself waking up and finding that you have been placed in a perfect square medieval looking enclosure surrounded by robotic creatures programed to kill. Now imagine that scenario with fifty or more teenage boys in the same situation. The Maze Runner is an action packed complex si-fi book that intrigues you to race to the finish.<br /><br />Thomas, the main character, starts his journey in a complete darkness with nothing left in his memory but his first name. After being terrified for what seems like hours, he is greeted by about fifty teenage boys. They all tell him he has been sent to a place they call the Glade.  The Glade is a giant square enclosure with stone walls covered in vines surrounded by a Griever filled maze and little mechanical beetles to keep an eye on them. After a couple days of settling in Thomas feels strangely at home. Thomas becomes one of the most prestigious jobs in the Glade, a runner. A runner consists of a Glader (what they call themselves) that runs through the mazes trying to find an exit. But ever since Thomas came, things have been different. Several days after Thomas is sent to the Glade, a girl, the first in Glade history, shows up in a coma. Thomas becomes friends with this girl and they together unlock the code to escaping the horrible Glade. The other main characters are Minho, Gally, Chuck, Alby, and Newt. Minho is the glades unspoken leader while the real leader is Ably. Newt is 2nd in command and is very good friends with Thomas. Thomas becomes best friends with a kid named Chuck. Chuck is a little kid whom is very innocent. Lastly there is Gally, who hates everyone and especially Thomas. The gladers have along with their own government have created their own vocabulary \\"I've been shucked and gone to heaven.\\"<br /><br />The book is written in a very inviting way. James Dashner has a very unique style of writing. His word choice mostly consists of made up words such as \\"shuck\\" and \\"klunk\\". James writes in Thomas's point of view but sometimes goes into the narrative point of view also. James likes to get in precise detail and paint the picture in your mind. James Dashner was born and raised in Georgia but he now lives in the Rocky Mountains with his family. He has four kids and loves writing.<br /><br />If I were to rate this book from 1-5 I would definitely give it a solid 5. This book avails very descriptive words and great voice. this book appeals greatly to teens because of the fact that all the characters are teens and are put through desirable challenges that make you feel like you're part of the book. This book is a sparkling complex diamond that has an unbreakable world choice along with a shining writing style. Overall, I would recommend this book to teens of all ages and even adults that desire si-fi genre books.
B0086700CM|5.0|Well we have all been wishing for his game now its here...FREE really this game is the best of all games it tops angry birds in my opinion!!Get this game!
B0086700CM|5.0|works great on kindle fire no complaints here. been playing this game since it came out and loving it and plenty of free coin opportunities
B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting to.play this but it cost money I love this app it is so addictive.I want to play it 24/7 .
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Although I must admit that the book was difficult to put down, I found that my stomach was twisted in knots throughout the entire story. I found it terribly disturbing to see a woman treated so poorly, and then whimpering around behind this man, trying to please his selfish desires. I applauded her at the end when she finally worked up the courage to say, \\"Enough!\\"<br />On another note, I disliked that the author repeated several phrases over and over throughout the book. It eventually became annoying, and I felt the need to invest in a thesaurus to mail to her. I'm not sure if I'll waste the money on the second and third books.I'm not saying that there is anything wrong with others enjoying this trilogy, but it just wasn't for this girl.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game so much it think it is so  fun and awesome u should get this app love it
B005723JSQ|2.0|This is a cute, easy to read story.  It's kind of Bridget Jones Diary like. Some funny moments that still have me laughing with a likeable female lead.  So why only 2 stars?  This reads like a $2.99 or less book.  Wait until it goes down in price before you buy it. It's good, but not THAT good.  You won't miss anything by waiting a little longer to buy it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for this game forever!! I love it! I can't put my kindle down!!! This game is very addicting.
B007NESBK2|5.0|It was a warm summer evening July 9, 2011 (still daylight) in downtown Cleveland, Ohio with bumper to bumper traffic searching for a good parking spot. Just a few blocks away was a parking garage then the trek to the Quicken Loans arena. Going down the stairs to the awaiting floor seats just second section, center second row. The pounding of the bass drum signaling the start of John Legend's set beginning with Rolling In the Deep. Yes John Legend, not Adele. Must have been his favorite song at the time (as well as everybody else's!!). Excellent opening act.<br /><br />Now the moment we have been waiting for with Soldier of Love, the opening from Apocalypse Now!! First thing I thought of anyway! Then the diva rising from the floor with the rest of her band!!! What a build up!! From then on, one after the other; Your Love is King, Skin to the dramatic opening of Smooth Operator & that kick ass bass solo that I never get tired of (& neither does Sade by her reaction!!). The lighting, sets, alternate, rockier versions of her biggest hits (Paradise my personal fave!) giving us the fans so much bang for our buck. I give this 5 stars as an ultimate souvenir of such an incredible night of music & class. The night was an anniversary present to ourselves (21st BTW!!) & we couldn't ask for better.<br /><br />As far as the few criticisms go for this performance, it is definitely not the same as being there. I can clearly see the flaws in the DVD/Blue ray. But a must have document for any Sade fan that has been there or wasn't fortunate to see it in person. Her heart was definitely in this show! Thank you Sade Adu and your incredible band for such a mesmerizing, magical & unforgettable concert experience.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I didn't think that it would be possible but Catching Fire is even better than The Hunger Games! Catching Fire was a spell-binding read for me. It was the perfect sequel to The Hunger Games, and answered some questions that left me wondering when I finished the first book. The author gives the reader a better understanding of Katniss' home town, the rather starkly named, District 12. District 12 is a poverty-stricken mining community which is strictly and harshly controlled by the Capitol. There is more description of the surrounding districts too which helps to build a bigger picture of the world in which Katniss lives. We are given a greater insight into the characters and their motivations which I found intriguing and I liked the romantic element which is further developed.<br />Catching Fire is a rollercoaster read and more than surpassed my expectations. There is a constant simmering tension brewing just under the surface which makes for some nailbiting reading! Again, the book was quite violent at times, not gratuitously violent as it was necessary to the overall plot, but I wouldn't recommend it to children under twelve.<br />Catching Fire is quite a thought-provoking novel. It could be argued that The Capitol represents dictatorial rule which some people are still enduring today and are so bravely rebelling against. It was interesting how the author compared and contrasted the atrocious lives of those living in the districts to the comfortable lives of the Capitol's citizens. It made me think how oblivious and even unconcerned we can be to the suffering of others.<br />Catching Fire is a riveting read from start to finish, which I would highly recommend. Try to have a few days free before you start reading the trilogy as you won't be able to get anything else done!
B0086700CM|5.0|what the heck how long dose it take come on people really think think are you out of your minds.

B002ZG994U|1.0|Sorry, but this movie is just a bunch of wannabees. The real A-Team was from the 80's. I can't stand to watch wannabees. I can't only watch the real deal and these guys aren't it.
B0086700CM|5.0|can't stop playing once you start! endless fun for hours......  graphics aren't fey good, but the game makes up for that in fun
0345803485|1.0|I have read so many blurbs about this book so I thought I'd check it out while traveling, I needed something to entertain me on a long flight anyway, but I must say that were it not for the fact that I was trapped at 32,000 feet with nothing to do I never would have made it through this thing.  It is so full of cliches!  Come on, a young constantly blushing virgin college student with a name like \\"Anastasia Steele\\" meets a mysterious and disturbed (yet way too sexy) businessman with way too much money and serious mommy issues that he likes to take out through S&M, and only little miss can't-stop-biting-her-lip can save him from himself.  Give me a break!<br /><br />The only half-decently written characters are the supporting cast and even then, they're often not all that interesting.  Don't even get me started on the sex scenes!  Sure, they're entertaining for a while, and what woman doesn't dream of having a sex god for a boyfriend, but considering the main character is orgasming on every other page towards the end of the book (and many of those start to look suspiciously similar like they were copy-pasted with a couple of details changed) it just gets beyond ridiculous. Towards the end I was tempted to skip the page describing her fourth orgasm of the day just so that I could get to something that actually moved the plot forward.  Right now I'm looking for a new well-written book to read in order to cleanse my brain of this Harlequin Romance-meets-whips and chains cliche of a novel.
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I have been playing this app since it was the FAOTD and I find it addicting.  I've been through about 30 levels and I like how there is always a logical next step.  Other reviewers have hit all the good and bad points.  the only major annoyance is that its too easy to accidentally really or unmark a box which can lead to problems if you don't catch it.
0307730697|5.0|Fearless, the story of Adam Brown, life, family and friends is the most amazing story you will ever read without a doubt!  Forget about the Apple Guy or the Facebook Kid, Adam Brown simply dwarfs them.  This story will inspire you and change your life! Adam Brown is the face and name of a true American Hero! In fact his picture should be on every cereal box and milk crate.  He is the definition of courage, a devoted loving husband, father, friend, son and fighter!  My prayers go out to his family and friends.  Thank you for sharing this incredible story.  His spirit lives on...

B005K17RU0|5.0|AccuWeather for Android is a great weather app.  It is fully functional including radar.  It is very accurate with local broadcasts, thermometers, and other weather programs.  It is easy to navigate.

B00132S74A|4.0|First book by Ken Follett that I have read. Will not be the last. If you like suspense and mystery he has you covered with Code to Zero.
B007SGM084|5.0|The story was superbly told.  Please note that the story about the main characters is deeper than JUST EROTICA...the arthur hypnotically entices the reader into the lives and psyches of the characters to weave a story that leaves the reader wanting MORE...another book!
0439023548|5.0|Excellent writing and great continuation of the story line.  The author keeps the reader guessing as to how the lead characters that remain - find their own path in life and how they deal with the aftermath of the games.
B0086700CM|5.0|Easy and effective. hours of endless fun, just keep trying to beat your last run. could use some swinging booby traps just to spice it up a little.
0345803493|5.0|Fifty Shades Darker is a continuation of Book one, Fifty Shades of Grey. The author does an excellent job of continuing into the depths of Christian Grey's life and the secrets to his past. E L James continues to keep the reader at the edge of her seat with this story!  Fabulous book - fantastic story.  It combines sex, true love and a dose of fear into a wonderful, wonderful story!

B005LAII0S|1.0|This movie is supposed to be a new take on the Snow White story, which really was not that great of a story to begin with. It is told from the perspective of the queen in such a poor manner that you will be questioning why you went to see this movie to begin with. The humor in this movie is horrible. I kept expecting over zealous studio laughter to chime in to fill the awkward silence after something \\"funny\\" occurred.<br /><br />Overall this movie is not worth the time of your life to watch. It is not even worth the time to read this review so do yourselves a favor and just stay away from another Hollywood re-hash of an old beaten down idea.
B0086700CM|4.0|yeah..........there are thousands of ways to get this beforehand......many have already........but some apps just aren't ready for the kindle.....like tap tap revenge.......I wouldn't mind that......I mean its on the.... I pod...i pad......I phone....on everything but kindle...... /temple run is just an old app now.......we crave for more....and suck up all the bandwidth
B0086700CM|5.0|Never heard of this game before and was tempted to try it after it got so many 5 star ratings.  Awesome fun!  you gotta be quick with reflexes on this one.  can't seem to be able to put it down!  Hope more free adventure games are coming soon for the kindle fire.  Enjoy!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love all the custom settings so you can personalize your game. its a great car-trip-time-waster. the ads that come up after it deals your cards can get annoying but its totally worth it.
B007ZKY7XO|4.0|What can be said? These guys are stanky. Magic Hour does not stray too far from its predecessor, Night Work. However we see virtually no rock elements that we saw much of on the Scissor Sister's first two albums, this is a straight up pop album. So lets just say if you were not of fan of Night Work, this one is still not for you. I can't blame anyone for dropping Scissor Sisters off their \\"must buy\\" list. If you were drawn to the uniqueness of the first two albums I can see how Magic Hour might be a disappointment. That being said, I can't help but love the tunes I'm hearing. They are still a ton of fun, with great unique song writing. It may be a pop album, but it blows the socks off of 99% of pop artists out there.<br /><br />The album as a whole is very dance oriented, you can tell they just came off a Lady Gaga tour. Track after track you will be throwing your own personal dance party (if you're into that kind of thing). There are two or three slower songs that have a lot of heart, but mostly this is a fast paced album. It is highly recommended for anyone who loves that side of the Scissor Sisters. For anyone who hates pop and everything it stands for, better luck next time.
B0086700CM|5.0|Ok ive been waiting 4ever for dis to come out. my bffs have played it on there phones, so ya i dont get 2 play it. its so fun and i just couldnt belive it whn my friend told meh it waz on da app store... :D wooooo dis an awsome game.
B004VQRCF0|5.0|I have pretty much everything these guys ever did, and as far as the video performances go, this one is by far my favorite.  Absolutely captures everything I remember about seeing the show twenty-plus years ago:  Eight of the finest musicians in the genre, beating the suits and the lawyers controlling the business end of the music scene, cruising on auto pilot, and seemingly enjoying every minute of their last performance together.  I absolutely love this DVD.
B0086700CM|1.0|I cant stress it enough temple run is just pure awesomeness.cant stop playing it I have it on I pod touch and kindle fire and it is amazing booth ways
B006VFLIYK|5.0|My friend Charles, musician extraordinaire, could have just as easily have been talking about The Innocent when he said:  it's not truly great until you make it look easy. For a writer, that's the top and Baldacci is there.<br /><br />Then I must add:  While he makes it look easy, he's also making it accessible.  Although I had frequent interruptions, I sailed through happily instead of slogging along.<br /><br />There are rumors that publishers are urging long manuscripts so the buyer gets more book for the buck.  Baldacci nimbly escaped that trap here--he or his editor knows how to use just enough.<br /><br />I will read it again and again for learning better writing,but mostly for fun.
B0086700CM|3.0|Temple Run is a fast paced, addictive game. Though it can be repetitive and aggravating at time. I always come back for more! Its good if you want to get your mind off things for a while.
0385523912|5.0|This book is incredibly informative yet reads like a novel. It's written really well. It has given me insight and understanding on what it must be like to live in North Korea. I recommend it to anyone interested in the subject.
B0086700CM|4.0|i have been waiting for this gqme to get out and now it is but it wont let me tilt it to collect coins big bummer
0345803485|5.0|I see what everyone is tallking about.  The book was a slow start for me (took about 6 chapters to get interesting). After that I just couldn't put it down.  It is more that the media has played it out to be (just sex), there is a story behind it.  I loved this book so much I am on the second book, getting ready to read the third book.  If you are not a big reader like me, this will get you interested in reading again!!!  I thought it was so good, all the women in my office are reading the trilogy.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is really cool and it is free.What is not to love? I totally recommend this to anyone. It works good on my kindle fire.
0316017930|4.0|I found myself alternately loving and hating this book. Loving it because it presented such an unprecendented view of human achievement and hating it because paradoxically it seems a trite argument supported by amazing stories that don't add up to much. After some reflection (at least a couple of minutes), I conclude that Gladwell's vivid story telling ability does tend to oversell the underlying message that environment and hard work play a much bigger role in human achievement than is traditionally accepted. I also believe that much of the criticism of this book is semantic. The critics and Gladwell are talking at cross-purposes, in that Gladwell acknowledges that talent does play a role in success. You have to have talent to get into Julliard, but his point is that what separates the merely talented from the extraordinary stars is the hard work and opportunity for hard work of the stars. I recommend this book for the following reason. What the book really shows is that almost without exception, extra-ordinary success results when talented people doing what they love meet extraordinary opportunities. Therefore, more people should do what they really love doing and while extraordinary opportunities are rare, sooner or later a meaningful opportunity will come along for them to find real fulfilment.
B0086700CM|5.0|This app is awesome don't listen to the 1star rates....this game is addicting....Ive been waiting forever for this to come out on the kindle fire

1451673442|5.0|I foresee that one of the reasons she named her book \\"The Magic\\" was to make the Christians go nuts assuming she is openly revealing she is a witch. I can easily imagine that Satanists, as well, would openly assume it was a book filled with witchcraft spells. However, it must be frustrating for them to find there is not a single thing, I have found, that is evil in this book. I haven't read the whole book yet, but so far I can envision Christians frantically searching the book looking for evil they can condemn and coming up empty-handed. Ha! That is a funny concept to me. They love to condemn others and so far I see nothing in this book any religion would find openly offensive.<br /><br />Of course, they would all complain that this book does not tell people that they should surrender their lives and all decisions to some particular church. Organized religions are always looking for people they can scare into being their willing slaves. So far all I have found is good in this book with nothing whatsoever to condemn.<br /><br />I will say that the more I advance in the Spirit the more I learn that real power from Intent comes to those who can silence their Internal dialogue, at will, while envisioning what they are intending as though it has already happened. It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words. Well proper envisioning, in states of inner-silence, is worth more than pages and pages worth of words. Those who cannot silence their internal dialogue, at will, are usually all talk.<br /><br />It takes more than saying all the \\"right words\\" to become a master of manifesting with the power of Intent. I'm learning it takes a mind disciplined and determined as though his or her life is hanging in the balance and they either succeed in the manifestation or they die trying. Most seem to want things so very easy. I've found that the easy route can also be the longest route. If you don't mind taking forever to become a master of manifesting then don't bother to discipline your mind to be able to stop your internal dialogue at will. You can say 'nicey nice' words for the rest of your life and stay weak-minded. Good luck with that!

B0086700CM|1.0|when about five million people threaten to drop amazon and figure out how to gt temple run by other means, amazon finally realizes people are poed and we want what we came for? on a kindle fire, sure, amazon has its differences from aneroid market, but really, think about it, kindle users. should we have had to WAIT AND WAIT AND WAIT for what we truly expected? I THINK NOT. so congrats amazon, you've accomplished something you couldn't have ever done without us angry consumers. what finally made you use temple run? wouldn't surprise me if someone sued you...

B0000041Z3|5.0|The Maazel cycle is one of the 3 or 4 best ever recorded of the Sibelius symphonies (see also Ashkenazy, Vaanska.) Given that it's still in print 50 years later that tells.  (Note that Karajan never recorded a complete cycle,) A cycle is like the decathlon in that there may be better individual performances here and there but the overall average is what counts. The original LP recordings were also of excellent quality and were some of the best given Sibelius in the entire LP era. Unfortunately Decca has taken a slipshod attitude towards remastering. Some forceful bass and deep brass note transients (note onset) played cleanly on the LPs but seem slightly distorted or unnatural here. That being said, his cycle has no bummers although some are better than others. In order:<br /><br />Sym 1  an all time great performance and recording. Only competition are Stokowski (Columbia Quadrophonic) and Collins (mono)<br /><br />Sym 2  so so performance and probably the least involved of the cycle. Ashkenazy's is better on London (Decca). Ormandy is fine but has mediocre sound.<br /><br />Sym 3  satisfactory but Davis is better.<br /><br />Sym 4 an alltime great performance and recording. Karajan on EMI is also great as is Vaanska and some others. This sym has had more good performances than any other by Sibelius.<br /><br />Sym 5  a good performance but somewhat quicker tempos than usual especially in the middle movement. A valid take on the score though and a good LP recording. Bernstein (substandard sound) and Rattle (EMI with the Philharmonia) have even better performances and more typical tempos. On the opposite side is Gibson (RCA) with quite slow tempos but still an interesting take and great sound.<br /><br />Sym 6  a really unique approach to the score and quite controversial although I and some others think this is quite effective in its way. Not a first choice for this work so try Karajan (DG) and Vaanska. The reason it is unique is the highly sunny almost rustic approach Maazel uses. It contrasts with the neoclassical norms of other recordings. Maazel sees a Finnish summer afternoon where the others see a summer evening.<br /><br />Sym 7  one of the all time best performances and the best recording of this work although there are quite a few good alternatives led by Karajan and Davis. Bernstein and Rozhdestvensky are good but with poorer recordings.
B007JM4CWY|2.0|I downloaded this game awhile back and loved it. Today, I got an update message so I installed the update. However, it glitched out my previous game. So I uninstalled the old version to get the new. And now all the levels that once were free reign, I have to pay $5 for! Not cool at all. Don't give me something for free and then make me pay. Needless to say, I deleted it. There are only a few puzzles now to solve. Lame move, Dynamix USA.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run finally got Jere and it is great and I got 17.3 million points best eva<br />no one can bear me
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I got it as faotd. It is as advertised. The game works the way it's supposed to but the instructions could be better. It was easy for me to figure out how it works because I already knew how to play the game. A novice might have a hard time.<br /><br /> After saying that, would I pay its full asking price? Maybe if it is only a dollar or 2 but not a penny more.
B006GHA9QQ|5.0|I have been waiting a long time for the Love Never Dies DVD to come out. Because I live in the United States, I had to wait a little longer than Australia and the United Kingdom. All I can say is, well worth the wait!<br /><br />When I first heard of an idea for a \\"Phantom of the Opera\\" sequel, I was a bit surprised and confused, asking myself, \\"How can they make a sequel to this? What's it gonna be about?\\" Then I heard the original London cast soundtrack and immediately fell in love with the music and songs. Ramin Karimloo and Sierra Boggess are the greatest Phantom and Christine EVER. EVER. So, I was a bit disappointed when they decided to release the movie from the Australian production and not from the London show, which I very much would have preferred. However, I can honestly say I was not at all disappointed by this show. The sets were amazing (Yes, better than the London show sets, I'll admit) and the cast was very comparable to the London cast. Anna O'Byrne plays a strong, independent Christine right from the beginning, and it was interesting to see Ben Lewis give the Phantom a more deep, baritone voice than the traditional high tenor voice that most actors have given the Phantom. The singing and acting were phenomenal. I just think that Lewis' voice sounded too tight and constrained at some points, almost like he was trying too hard to hit a note (especially in the opening \\"Till I Hear You Sing\\" sequence). And the creepy eye thing he was doing throughout the show- what was that? He was pulling a Sarah Brightman, I thought. However, aside from those two flaws, he did a highly exceptional job playing the Phantom.<br /><br />The rest of the cast was top-notch. I would have liked to see the regular human-sized Fleck instead of her being a midget, though. I think the London version of Fleck worked better than a midget. And while I would like to see a full-length feature movie at some point with perhaps Gerard Butler and Emmy Rossum once again, I have a feelingthat this is the closest we will ever get of a \\"Love Never Dies\\" movie. Somehow, even with the revised, improved Australia show, I still think that not many people are very fond of a sequel to arguably the greatest musical ever written. Because of this, I'm afraid that Lloyd Webber might cut this show entirely and act as if it never happened. I hope not, though- I loved this! It was fantastic and incredibly moved. At the end, I even got a little teary-eyed. I don't care what the haters and critics say. Andrew Lloyd Webber has struck gold twice and created a quality sequel to \\"The Phantom of the Opera.\\" The setting in Coney Island was pure genius because the Phantom can really relate to all the freaks and oddities living there when they have nowhere else to go. Plus, the Phantom has some background at being displayed, and living, in fairs and travelling circuses, as mentioned in the original \\"Phantom.\\" The clever references to the original show also blend very well in the show. So seriously, I highly recommend this to anybody who is a fan of \\"The Phantom of the Opera.\\" PLEASE! Don't let the critics and haters influence you. Take a look at this for yourself and keep an open mind, and I promise you you will love this!
B0086700CM|5.0|awesome they didn't have it for a while but they finally got it and its awesome<br />I I I I
B003MWVDW2|5.0|I came across Dr Who in early 2009, and watched every available episode from Series 1 & 2. Much to my surprise, I discovered that Doctor Who had been around since 1962, and was just as cool then as it had been forty-seven years before I'd ever heard of it.<br /><br />This 'season' re-introduces the Doctor in his latest regeneration, as well as his companion Rose Tyler. Both Actors did an outstanding job, and I highly recommend this series to anyone with a little taste for sci-fi/fantasy.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|You might ask why someone develops a simple calculator app for the Kindle Fire. The answer is to do it right!  I have reviewed and looked at many calculator apps for the Kindle Fire and this is by far the best of what I have seen so far.<br /><br />Here is what I like about it:<br /><br />* The user graphics interface is just sharply designed and it looks professionally done.  The brushed texture of the case and the color of the buttons are great.<br />* The buttons are large and easy to touch and read.  Some apps I have used the buttons are so small that you literally touch two at a time.<br />* It uses the full screen size of the Kindle Fire to give you a nice sized calculator view<br />* The numbers in the result display are large and easy to read.<br />* The display provides you with the numbers and action you used in your last calculation.<br />What I don't like:<br />* The number transaction bar shows the data in light grey.  If you are going to do it then make it darker and easy to read.<br />* There are ads as this is a free version of the product.  The ads show up in a thin bar at the top of the calculator and do not distract from the product.  I like that they are on the top so you don't accidently touch them while holding your Kindle Fire. I don't like ads but the calculator design is so good I'll keep it.<br /><br />I don't know what the \\"Plus\\" is for in the name but this is a nice app that is attractive and easy to use. It is by far the best simple calculator design I have seen!

0802130208|1.0|I didn't find this book at all interesting or amusing.  The characters were unrealistic.  There was no plot.  There was nothing funny about it.  I forced my self to finish this one.  But I consider it a waste of time.
B007MAETA8|5.0|First a little background.  I've been a Mayer fan since his early days...Well, \\"Inside Wants Out\\" early days.  I am a 33 year old father of 2, but boy I used to be a Mayer fanatic.  I've been to many concerts, private shows ( in the early days) and Ive gotten a chance to meet him and talk to him for a few minutes.  I know what you are all thinking, and no, I was never a 15 year old girl.  Ive always been a guy and damnit I just was fascinated by Mayer.  I've been playing guitar for a long time and was just blown away with John's chops...but enough about me.  Bottom line, huge fan....<br /><br />So after buying every album, every DVD and joining every fan club, I was a little saddened when a friend asked me last Tuesday how Mayer's new album was and I didn't have an answer for him.  Had i really forgotten today was release day?  What kind of fan am I!!!  I felt like I forgot my anniversary and had to rush to get a present for the Mrs. I guess I'd realized that I'd grown up a little.  I no longer had my weird man crush on Mayer.  No longer perused the message boards, followed him on tour, but obviously I was getting the album.  I've grown up , sure, but so has Mayer.  After listening to this album, it's like rekindling an old flame.  Breaking out an old guitar you haven't played in a while, and realizing why you've kept it stored up all these years.<br /><br />Its apparent in Born and Raised that Mayer is evolving as an artist the way his fan base has matured and evolved.  He's not trying to be the guy we all fell in love with on Room for Squares.  He's not trying to be SRV or Hendrix anymore.  He's Mayer being Mayer...making damn good music that's just catchy as hell and fun to listen to.  I've listened to this about 12 times all the way thru and its just one of those albums that keeps growing on you.  That, in my opinion, makes a great album.  By now you've all heard about the country music and Neil Young/southern rock influence on the album. Yeah its got that, but at heart its still Mayer.  Not played out Mayer, but mature Mayer.<br /><br />There are some really amazing songs on here.  I think 10 out of 12 are solid and the other 2 are pretty good.  Something Like Olivia I think is my favorite, and Queen of California is right up there.  At first listen, you may cringe a little with \\"Whiskey, Whiskey Whiskey\\" or \\"Love is a Verb.\\"  It seems the old Mayer used to hide the title of the song brilliantly in the Lyrics.  In at least those 2 songs, the titles are very apparent parts of the song.  You will see what  I mean.  Most of you reading these reviews , I'm sure, are Mayer fans.  You either love the guy, or you haven't heard enough to get thru the cute pop tunes a la \\"Wonderland.\\" My suggestion is to listen to this album all the way thru 5 times.  I'm confident you will agree with most of the other reviews here.  In any event, it feels good to have you back Mayer...at heart its still Mayer.  Not played out Mayer, but mature Mayer.<br /><br />There are some really amazing songs on here.  I think 10 out of 12 are solid and the other 2 are pretty good.

B007L3BMGA|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed every moment.<br />It took me off to another world - dark and mysterious.  When will book two and three be available on kindle?
0439023521|5.0|Wow. I can't even say haw good this EPIC book is. Good exiting plot, suspensful, interesting, fun, but the main reason why I love these books (yes, all 3) so much is that they have important themes and issues. These books make you THINK! Read this, or your missing out on everything.
B0036TGSIK|5.0|I wasn't sure about this movie when I saw the previews for it at theaters, and honestly didn't watch it until it had been out for quite awhile..I ended up watching it on tv, and was pleasantly surprised! What I initially wrote off as just \\"another dumb teen movie\\", turned out to be anything but! Emma Stone plays the part of Olive perfectly, with enough humor to make you not only laugh out loud, but also relate to her. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is looking to laugh throughout; not only is it funny, but it also drives home a point that parents AND teens can both relate to; and of course, there's the age old theme of \\"don't believe everything you hear\\" throughout.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|it is good but gets a bit boring after a while. the games are a bit simple but it works to kill some time

B006UG90RM|5.0|All I can say is Van Halen is back!! I was a little concerned at first that they brought back a few old demo tunes but after listening to the record, I love how they have re-vamped them!!! Roth's lyrically brilliant on this record and the rhythm section is amazing\\"-).Eddie is so good on this record it's unbelieveable. A job well done boys, you should be very proud of this effort!!!! Thumbs up from me\\"-)

B0086700CM|5.0|this game is (great! its really addicting. the only bad part is how they repeatedly ask you to rate the game.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|You can't go wrong, this is the best paste out there, just be sure to use the right amount!! and let it set up! it takes several use cycles to setup this means let the CPU get hot then shut down let it cool, just use your computer like normal if you don't shut your computer off for the night it will not set up right!! everyones idea of normal use is not the same!!! A few hours on and a few off will set it up faster and you will see better temps over time. I have a I7 that idles at 22c and peaks at 45c at 100% load this took 2 weeks to achive.
B0086700CM|5.0|I am so excited that amazon finally got this app. I absolutely love it. It is very addicting. Mine freezes for a second every now and then but doesn't affect me much.

B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I am so addicted to this game. So far it hasn't given me any problems. One thing I wish would change is the word selection. You shouldn't be able to use the same word more than once with the same opponent. Other than that I think it is very fun.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I couldn't wait until this game came out on the kindle. its do much fun and best part you can play it with your friends and family.  but the part I don't like is that if you play someone radom and they are really unsafe or gross you cant delete them.:/
0439023491|4.0|SUMMARY<br /><br />Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mallark have survived the Hunger Games and are back home in the Seam. Katniss should be happy; the berries saved both District 12 tributes. But Peeta has turned away from her and Gale is very distant. Life in the Seam has become a little boring. She hates the house in Victors Village, preferring her old house. Hunting is reserved for Sundays. She is oblivious to the rumors of rebellions in other districts until President Snow visits. She must convince him that she and Peeta are truly in love and quell the sparks of rebellion against the Capitol during her Victory Tour or face enormous consequences.<br /><br />What she doesn't know is that she'll fail. President Snow has no intention to let her live as evident in the Quell Games. But she can make sure that Peeta survives, believing him to be the better leader to the rebels. But the spark has been lit and the flames of rebellion are spreading, and she is the face of the rebellion whether she likes it or not. She must survive not matter the cost.<br /><br />MY THOUGHTS<br /><br />1.) I screamed throughout the first third of Catching Fire! I get the teen angst, but Katniss' anguish over her feelings for Peeta and Gale drove me crazy. I wanted to shake her saying \\"Make a decision, for Heaven's sake!\\" The love triangle plot line has run its course for me. And she came across as a whiny little girl rather than \\"the girl on fire\\" sparking rebellion throughout the districts of Panam. She is surprised to find herself as a leader and hopes of her people. Why? Collins really didn't know or gives the reader a typical teen aged girl experiencing life through her own narrow prism. I was not impressed with this Katniss.<br /><br />Thank goodness President Snow's visit finally drowned Katniss' whiny teen angst. She became the fighter again with the will to survive and protect everyone she cares about. This is the Katniss I like and care for. But our heroine still can't discern friend from foe. She misses clues as to whom she can trust at the Capitol party and rarely heeds Haymitch's advice. But he did get his way.<br /><br />2.) I loved the duel between Katniss and President Snow. He wants her dead and Panam back to normal under his totalistic control. I had originally thought the Capitol was an oligarch but I was wrong. The people of the Capitol are shallow sheep that Snow uses for his pleasure. Even despots need courtesans. But trusted courtiers can be dangerous as many kings, queens, and czars fell.<br /><br />3.) Collins's writing is still top notch. Her vivid descriptions of Katniss and Peeta's Quell Games opening ceremony blew me away. I felt chilled and worried for Cinna and Portia. The Capitol party disgusted me. The drug to induce vomiting so the partiers could endlessly eat was despicable given the starvation throughout the districts, but more importantly I questioned Collins use of it. Many young girls struggle with eating disorders. The twist ending had me pleasantly flummoxed; I never saw it coming.m foe.

B005LAIIRQ|3.0|If you like Liam's acting, you'll like this film. If you're not a prude or are able to watch a movie for entertainment purpose, acknowledging that this is not some sort of factual nature show, you may enjoy this movie. I found the acting well done and the story was decent. I've never heard or read of an actual confirmed wolf attack on humans, I'm sure it has happened but this was the only real inaccuracy I saw with the movie. I'm sure guys working in oil refineries can be crude (anybody know any construction workers because they're basically the same types). Adults curse and I know when you get a bunch of guys together they curse a lot, so get over it. It's R rated, you should be watching the 700 club or something by Kurt Cameron if you have a problem with R rated movies and real life situations in general. Put your head in the sand if you can't stomach movies that question life. By the way, I didn't find that Liam's character was atheist. I think he was contemplating issues that were very traumatic that may have questioned his faith or existence. He couldn't cope with the depression from the loss of his wife. It's a real issue and just because you're ignorant of feelings and emotions, don't pass judgement on others (this especially goes for all of you hypocrite religious types). In my mind he was actually contemplating God's as well as his own existence and in the end wanted to live more than anything. As dark as it was, it was actually a very uplifting ending. Seeing as how he almost had given up on life only to later fight \\"tooth and nail\\" (no pun intended) to survive was an re-awakening for Liam's character.
B0063B2BNE|5.0|This season of Bones was really good and I have to say really good storylines. I liked the last episode because I think that David Boreanaz is a good director and actor. I also think that the ending was really good. Emily Deschanel is another good actor as well. I will be making this a show to purchase in the future.
0486211045|4.0|As an art student, I've perused quite a few instructive anatomy books. I was suggested Bridgman by a teacher who ranked him as simply the best. A lot of the reviews here seem to focus on quality of reproduction, so I'm going to focus on the original product. By the way, get Dover.<br /><br />Pros:<br />As stated universally. Bridgman runs through the all the major body masses ranging from something as large as the trunk, to something as minuscule as the septum of the nose.<br /><br />He shows the human form in various stages of muscular undress, ranging from skeletal to fully skinned. There are often numerous angles and perspectives from which to study as well, and proportions are helpfully laid out in block form for the larger masses.<br /><br />Speaking plainly, I haven't found a book that does better than what Constructive Anatomy does.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Formatting is a little awkward. Text that pertains to a whole section appears on the first page of the section, and the following pages are wordless. This makes it mildly frustrating to follow the words of wisdom that Bridgman is no doubt divulging. Which brings me to another drawback.<br /><br />The vocabulary matches the book's age. Expect a great deal of Latin nouns. Despite having a pretty firm grasp on bone and muscle names, I found myself lost on numerous occasions. Consider the following text, describing the armpit:<br />\\"Its rear wall is deeper, since the latissimus attaches farther down the back; thicker because made of two muscles (latissimus and teres major), and rounder because its fibres turn on themselves before attaching to the arm bone.\\"<br />This would be an extremely minor annoyance if not for the complaint mentioned above. Much of the text is disassociated with the illustrations, forcing you to either flip back and forth, or try to follow along in your head.<br /><br />My final con is what irked me the most. There is no female anatomy to speak of, and neither does Bridgman speak of it. Foran anatomy book, this is a severe drawback. I understand the age of the book may have made such depictions taboo, but we're talking about half the population here. Bridgman's men are patently bony. Not as a synonym for thin, as they are exceedingly thick, but his bones have a tendency to protrude and take the shape of geometric objects. This is of course very beneficial to students, and his drawings are pure joy to duplicate, but you can imagine how hard it is to transfer this knowledge to the neglected sex. Anatomy books have a tendency to prioritize subjects approximately in the following order: the Male figure, the Female figure, the effects of age and finally, the child. Bridgman focuses solely on the first of the queue.<br /><br />My conclusion is thus: Bridgman's Constructive Anatomy is an excellent manual for building men of young to middle age. The description applied to it most often seems to be \\"it's a great starter book.\\" I would contend that the male and female figures are so different as that one cannot \\"start\\" with a male figure, and end up with a female figure. Consequently, Constructive Anatomy is not a great starter book for understanding the female structure.<br /><br />Despite the cons I have stated, I have given the book 4/5 stars. Why? Because I knew of these drawbacks before I purchased the books, and purchased it anyway. The score is not some form of self-punishment for making a mistake, but a rating of the material I knew and wanted. I only list the cons so that future purchasers may know them as well, and make a more evaluative judgment.
B007R1HX3M|3.0|I have to say the storyline for this episode was good, but I think the teamwork between Castle and Beckett was really strained. I have to say thi episode was not one of my favorites because the teamwork was a little strained. I like the guy from Scottland yard. Overall I think the issues with the two main characters made things hard for the police work on the case.

B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I bought my Kindle in 2007; recently, I noticed that part of the protective coating on the cable had chipped off.  I didn't think much of it and placed it back in a pocket of my laptop bag.  In a matter of weeks, the whole thing had disintegrated.<br /><br />I came here to order a replacement and found out that this is a known issue (defective batch) and that if you call Kindle support (866-321-8851) they will replace it for free -- despite the fact that my Kindle is 5 years old.<br /><br />Even better, the way they do it is to place it in your cart and then ask you to execute the purchase while they simultaneously credit the account.  I'm on travel, so I was able to choose a different shipping address and pay for the 1-day shipping (I was worried that they would only ship to the billing address.)  The entire conversation and transaction took less than five minutes.<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!<br /><br />(edited to correct the phone number)

0345803485|1.0|Thank you Lord, I thought there must be something wrong with me.  I have been hearing all about this book for weeks & how great it was.  I never buy books for myself, so as a rare treat to myself I bought it...what a waste of money!!!  I read the first few chapters & thought, \\"it's got to get better than this.\\"  Sadly, I kept thinking that thought throughout the whole book.  Basically it's badly written porn, nothing about this novel, & I use the term lightly, is romantic.  Several people have referred to it as erotica...what's erotic about a women who really doesn't want to get physically abused, getting abused.  This is in no way consensual, she does it because she's afraid she's going to lose her \\"boyfriend\\" if she doesn't...can anyone say coercion?!?!?!  Not to mention all the \\"rules,\\" calling him sir, not looking at him, kneeling while waiting for him, & the list goes on.  Oh yeah, punishment sex?!?!?  Yeah he has sex with her & won't let her organism as punishment instead of spanking her...SICK!!!  I just don't get how having someone treat me as subservient slave sexy...dehumanized, humiliated for another's pleasure...sorry I just don't get it?  I won't even go into all the other issues with this book as they've been written about extensively.  Let me put it this way, I read Twilight, because I have a teen & I pre-read a lot of her books, well I found it to be better written & more enjoyable than this book...that's not saying much either!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is AWESOME!!!!! not as awesome as God but still reeeeeeeally cool. definately recommending.  totally.  get. it. :)  amazingly cool.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|well this is an interesting read it's written on a very basic level, no large words or complex ideas I read all 3 volumes and the story was fairly good I don't understand what all the fuss made over the movie was all about, maybe it's just a good adventure story.  I found the writing to be a the normal level for the general public about 3rd grade very easy to follow and not very complex....

They didn't play all the songs on the soundtrack and some of the songs were out of order. I was really looking forward to being able to see the musical number for ALL the songs.

0385344228|4.0|This is certainly a well crafted book and worthy of a read, but not a five-star novel.<br /><br />This book could have been a narrative about the wife, Laurie, and the destruction of her family, marriage, and life by the events of the murder(s), trial, and attendant revelations.  This would have required more development of Laurie, maybe dividing the novel into \\"Laurie's Book\\" and \\"Andy's Book.\\"<br /><br />The author seems to think that suicide is a literary device to resolve plot issues.  The author leads us to believe that the Laurie is a valid character, but never resolves the profound issues of her life.  She is smart, attractive, a leader among her suburban sisters, later ostracized.  She deteriorates physically and emotionally over the course of the novel.  Slowly and inexorably she confronts the lie of her husband's life and the criminality of her son.  Her attempted suicide is ingenuine, and a plot cop-out.<br /><br />But the novel is the tragedy of her husband, Andrew.<br /><br />At the earliest times in the novel - not the beginning due to the multi flashbacks & forwards - Andy is a successful assistant D.A. in a suburban Boston town.  Kid, soccer-mom wife, house, steady job, etc.  But it is all founded on a complex fatal lie by Andy.  The lie unfolds to destroy his career, wife and child.<br /><br />The lie is first a lie told by Andrew to himself.  As a young man, he tells himself he is not the son and grandson of murderers.  He denies to himself that the murderer Bloody-Billy is his father, though he knows it is true.  He extends the lie, never telling his wife until circumstances compel.  He lives the lie, embracing a career upholding the law as a prosecutor.  He invests decades of his life in the deception.<br /><br />Relentlessly, events reveal truths that expose the lie.  In early childhood, Jacob hurts other children and the events are dismissed as day-care misadventures.  Then the murder of a fourteen year-old classmate, Ben, equivocally can be more of the same or simply a false accusation.  The investigation of the murder of Ben is occasion for the suspension of Andy and the practical end of his career as assistant prosecutor.<br /><br />The pretrial preparation for the defense of Jacob causes Andy to reveal for the first time to his wife that Andy is the son of a convicted murderer.  He says that if he had told Laurie when they first met as college students, she - a proper Jewish girl from a good family - would have had nothing to do with him.  The trial prep exposes a psychiatric evaluation of Jacob consistent with sever psychiatric disability.<br /><br />As narrator, Andy frankly exposes his cynical view of the criminal law and his part in process, not a virtuous belief in the criminal justice system.  In this, he and his incarcerated felon-father are identical.  It exposes the falsity of Andy's life, the complex lie to himself.<br /><br />Penutimately, it is a second murder that ends the problem of the courtroom defense of Jacob.  Andy reveals that an ex-con directed by Andy's father is involved in the murder/suicide and confession of a child molester and putative killer of Ben Rifkin.  Andy accepts the nol-pros dismissal of the charges against Jacob founded on the murder/suicide/confession, which Andy as prosecutor should have abhorred.<br /><br />Ultimately, the post-trail disappearance and death of another of Jacob's friends leads Laurie to accept the truth of her greatest horror, her son is a serial killer.  She destroys Jacob, herself, and implicitly her marriage in a single-car collision.<br /><br />Andy ends the narratives purgering himself before a grand jury.

0439023521|4.0|Imagine you're 12, and you just got chosen to fight to the death with other teenagers...  Just recently I was lucky enough to read the Hunger Games. Let me tell you it was like taking a trip into the future. I loved this book, and I would rate it 9 out of 10 stars.  There are 3 books in the series, so if you like this one you can continue the adventure with 2 other books.<br /> This book is based in the future about a young teenage girl named Katniss. The earth has been destroyed through war and other disasters. All that remains is the Capital City and 12 other districts. The Capital is made up of the government officials, and they have taken over. They have divided everyone into a district. There used to be 13 districts, but everyone started to rebel against the Capital. The rebellion was due to the Capital forcing the districts into extreme poverty. As a warning sign to the rest of the districts' the Capital demolished district 13. Every year the Capital throws an event called the \\"Hunger Games\\". This is where they randomly pick one boy and one girl, 12 to 18 years old, from each district, to fight against one another to the death.  This is a disgusting display of abuse of power by the Capital.<br /> In the Hunger Games there are a total of 24 kids competing against each other.  If you win you will receive many supplies so you can live like a king. Katniss lives in District 12. The only family she has left is her mother and her twelve year old little sister named Prim. Prim is now twelve, and is very worried because she is now eligible to be picked for the Hunger Games. Katniss often leaves District 12 into a forbidden area to hunt for food with her very good friend named Gale. Selling the animals they catch provides them money and food for their families. Katniss is very skilled at hunting with her bow. The animals cower in fear anytime Katniss enters the forest.  Katniss and Gale often talk about running away and surviving in the woods together.<br /> Prim is later picked for the Hunger Games and Katniss volunteers to go for her instead. After this happened Katniss and Prim both started crying like a bunch of new born babies. Another boy named Peta was selected as well. Since Katniss is going for Prim, she must complete a training course for the games. Katniss is getting advice from a previous winner named Haymich. Haymich is always drunk 24/7.  He is what keeps the liquor stores in business. He is far from helpful. One of his pieces of advice for her was, \\"Here is some advice. Stay alive.\\" Such an obvious statement, Katniss was less than thrilled.  She also has to do several interviews for TV broadcasting. During one of her TV events she had an outfit that made her appear to be on fire.  That is when she got the nickname \\"Katniss the girl on fire\\".  This costume burned bright like the sun in the sky.<br /> Peta also gave the impression that they were lovers to gain favor from the viewers. Now they both have to act like they are in love.  This is beneficial because it is now giving them a wholesome and innocent image. When the Hunger Games finally starts everyone runs into the forest like a pack of animals escaping the pound. Peta becomes part of an evil group, but they are just using him to track and kill Katniss. She finds out about this and is furious with Peta. Katniss makes a friend named Rue. Katniss and Rue become very close. They plan to take down the group Peta is in. After they destroy the bad group, Rue gets killed by another contestant. Katniss, drunk with rage, kills the other contestant who killed Rue. Then she lets her tears rain down in remembrance of Rue. Later in the games there is an announcement that you can pair up with someone that is in your district. Katniss and Peta meet up. Katniss finds out Peta wasn't trying to kill her and she does her best to protect him. Peta and Katniss both survive until the very end like true warriors. Then an announcement is made that only one person can win.  This makesfor a very tricky ending.<br /> This book has a great style of writing. By this, I mean the book has a lot of detail and descriptive vocabulary. The characters have creative names unlike something ordinary like \\"Bob\\".  It makes the characters stick out in your mind. When reading you will believe that this is what the future will become.  The book does a great job at sucking you in.<br /> If you really want to find out the end of this book I recommend buying it, or checking it out from a nearby library. The reason I gave this book a 9 out of 10 was because it started out slow for me. I was also not into the parts where the book talked about Katniss and Peta's relationship. I am not into romantic stories. However, the rest of this book was like a roller coaster ride.  It was action packed, and the details of the story will keep you wanting more.  If you want to get into the series start here because otherwise you will miss out on a bunch of background information.for a very tricky ending.<br /> This book has a great style of writing.

1400052181|4.0|The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks, like many compelling works of nonfiction, was written to tell one story, but, in its creation, uncovered several others. On the surface, Rebecca Skloot's book is about a line of cells, extracted from a single cancer patient in the 1950s, that went on to be the most widely studied human cell line in the world. On another level, it's about an evolving debate over the medical ethics of cell and DNA ownership. How much say should patients have in the use of their own genetic material? How does society balance the needs of medical research against concerns for privacy and individual autonomy?<br /><br />On still another level, The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks is about race relations in America, about uneven levels of white privilege and black privilege when it comes to access to information and advocacy. It's a story about casual exploitation by a scientific establishment that was trained to compartmentalize and not think of its work in personal terms. Finally, it's a story of a family struggling to find emotional and spiritual closure after the years following the death of their mother, who continues in a strange and somewhat mystifying afterlife.<br /><br />If the book had simply been about science and ethical questions pertaining to the cells of Henrietta Lacks, I might not have found it more than mildly interesting, but the human element gives the story many more dimensions. I think Skloot did an excellent and honest job of conveying how one poor, black family from the rural South perceives science and medicine. Of course, they understand and care about the basic things that most Americans do, but their views are colored by a history and identity that, I, a well-educated, middle-class white northerner, simply haven't lived in. It was a fascinating and ultimately hopeful exploration beyond stereotypes and into how human beings really relate to questions that can never be entirely viewed in clinical, medical terms. You get to know Henrietta's extended family, and to view her life and unintended contribution to science as they do.<br /><br />Overall, the book felt like an extended episode of This American Life, in that it didn't explore (or resolve) any issue in great depth, but was engagingly put together and taught me a little about a lot of different subjects. Since it's not a long read, I'd say it's well-deserving of its awards and your time.

0385738765|1.0|I read and enjoyed \\"The Maze Runner\\" on the recommendation of a student of mine, who neglected to tell me it was the first of a series. I don't mind reading a series, but I do expect each installment to move the story line along and to give us further insight into the protagonists and antagonists. \\"The Scorch Trials\\" fails to do this. We still know little about WICKED, too little, except that they will intervene when necessary, which essentially negates the whole idea of trials for the Gladers and the girls they have met. If WICKED can simply drop in and save Thomas' life, then what is the purpose of the trials? Cranks are too similar to zombies for me, seemingly playing on the current craze for zombies in novels and movies. I felt a little like I'd undergone my own Scorch by the time I finished the novel, as again and again the characters appear to be safe, only to have their hopes dashed. And what's with all the forewarnings that Teresa is always giving Thomas? Please, just tell us the story without the heavy-handed attempts to create suspense with ominous warnings like \\"Things are going to get bad for you, Thomas.\\" I was disappointed and frustrated with this book, to say the least.

B004T4KQJS|4.0|When it comes to physics, Krauss is enjoyable, entertaining, inspiring and educational. When it comes to philosophical issues I wish he'd just stop talking. His obvious disdain for philosophy (which he strangely lumps in with theology throughout the book) does not crop up too often but when it rears its ugly head it makes me sad. Overall I think the book is successful, it provides a good understanding of current findings about something coming from \\"nothing\\" (meaning a vacuum) and gives an insight into the very plausible possibility of a quantum theory of gravity being able to create \\"nothing\\" from *NOTHING* (meaning an absence of even so-called 'empty space').<br /><br />The common accusation that Krauss simply redefines the word nothing will only come from those who have not bothered to read the whole book. Krauss actually admits that something from \\"nothing\\" (the empty space nothing) is not really an explanation for the origin of the universe itself, but rather an explanation for the origin of the stuff in the universe (matter & energy), and the expansion of it.<br /><br />So take the book with a grain of salt if you're like me and enjoy philosophy and think it is a very worthwhile discipline, because Krauss' ham-handed approach to it will likely grate you.

B002MCJZHS|5.0|The XX's selftitled debut is surprisingly good.  At times seductive, at times haunting, the quiet and hushed moods that The XX create are worth taking time to listen to.  The music here is reminiscent of 80's new wave and current electronic-influenced indie-rock.  Headlined by a male and female vocalists, many of these songs are duets.  The two singers harmonize so well together in their own sleepy ways.<br /><br />The instrumentation and vocals are sure-handed; it's all so confident that it feels as if this band has been making music together for years.  Much of the production is minimalist: a guitar (not really playing chords), scant bass, electronic-sounding mid-tempo drums.  With this bare production, the craftsmanship of the of the songwriting is upfront; these lyrics and melodies are really great.<br /><br />Fans of Spoon ([[ASIN:B000056O2Q Girls Can Tell]]), The Dandy Warhols ([[ASIN:B000SXBOW2 Welcome To The Monkey House]]), or Silversun Pickups ([[ASIN:B000FUF86Q Carnavas]]) will find a lot to enjoy in this album.  Recommended highlights for sampling: the lead single \\"Crystalised,\\" \\"VCR,\\" \\"Shelter,\\" and the opening instrumental \\"Intro.\\"
0307387178|4.0|Into The Wild- Jon Krakauer<br /><br />Dov Guggenheim<br /><br />  When a teenager picks up a book that is seemingly on his reading level, the suspected genre is usually either fiction, non-fiction, or science fiction.  One would also suspect the book to be one storyline, a plot that involves a main character, a conflict, and how the conflict was resolved.  \\"Into The Wild\\" is absolutely none of this. Into the wild does have a main character, Christopher McCandless, who decides to leave a life with many advantages, lots of money, and a college degree, to go into the wild. But that is the only similarity.  From case studies, to the exciting twists and turns of a rebellious young adult's life, and people he meets on his journey, the part biography, part non-fiction, part case study book \\"Into The Wild\\" is anything but a normal book.<br /><br />\\"Into The Wild\\" is a book relating to the story of Christopher McCandless(who changes his name to Alex Supertramp), a well-to-do man who recently graduated from Emory University. His father, Walt, always pressures him to be perfect, and Christopher hates his father and everything about him, like his constant, imprudent chase of material happiness, and having two simultaneous relationships- one with his ex-wife, and one with Christopher's mother, Billie. After some time, Christopher donates all of his money, leaves a family that loves him, and leaves behind almost all of his possessions to leave to an Alaskan wilderness with just a gun, some bullets, some rice, and some basic survival books. He meets many people along the way, including a woman named Jan, who becomes his mother figure( her son had also abandoned her- she encourages Christopher to go back home, or at least tell his parents what he's up to and accept some items for well-being- take this passage as an example of her personality- \\"Have you let your people know what you're up to? Does your mom know you're going to Alaska? Does your dad know?... I'd keep at it until he'd change the subject, though- because of what happened between me and my own son. He's out there somewhere, and I'd want someone looking after him like I looked after Alex), a man named Ronald, who takes him in as a son and gives him work, shelter, food, and other living qualities, and other certain charecters. Christopher is always moving, and he dies over one hundred days after he left. Many people judge this whole ordeal negatively, but Krakauer makes sure to mention in his author's note \\"I will leave it to the reader to form his or her own opinion of Chris McCandless\\"- that you should have your opinion of this whole episode.<br /><br />This book is a very unique book, so that being said, it's memorable, and the content of this book can be perceived as instructive. The whole kid running away from home storyline and the multiple opinions and interviews definitely portray some instructive points regarding rebellious actions. That same storyline is also very controversial. This book is a real live story of a real kid running away from home and trying to survive in the wilderness with basically nothing, and this garnered a lot of opinions of Chris, mostly negative. So although maybe this whole situation is hard to imagine, it's very possible we'll know (or become) someone like this. But the book itself was written very well and portrayed in a fairly unbiased manner, leaving yourself to make an opinion of your own.<br /><br />Another reason this book is so good is that even though there is very little suspense( anybody can figure out in the beginning of the book that in the end, Christopher dies) the book is so well written that the whole story line is very gripping. Krakauer attempts to go back in the past and see  what made Chris perish.<br /><br /> There a few negatives to the book, though. First off, it's confusing. The whole story constantly is in flux, changing characters, scene, and point of view. It's hard to keep pace, but if you do, you'll understand the book the way it's meant to be. The problem is, if you don't, you might get some wrong ideas, and those are never good. Also, while generally in the whole book Krakauer wrote very well, including all the details, I felt as if that he didn't fully explain why Chris hated his parents so much that he abandoned his life. In fact, he almost made Chris seem as if he was a kid who wanted nothing to do with his parents for no good reason, and if Chris was as smart as he was, I'm sure there was a reason- this lack of detail can lead you to think Chris made a very dumb decision in leaving, which many people do, but Krakauer doesn't. Had he further detailed Chris's relationship with his parents, and why it was so bad, I'm sure it would be easier to see why Chris left.<br /><br /> This book, though a real, non-fiction, story, can teach a lesson- but which lesson is being taught by the book will vary from reader to reader. Chris obviously wanted to leave his family, and it's mentioned that he left in response to his father's imprudence. He leaves behind everything he knows, and meets people along his journey, but eventually dies. Different studies are brought in that are similar to this story. So what lesson is to be taught from this whole book( which is really a lot of different, relating stories, in one binding.)? That should you act rebelliously, bring more items and be better prepared and educated? That you should not act rebelliously at all? Krakauer insists Chris did nothing wrong, but others say it was foolish and arrogant of him to ditch everything and go into the wild. What's your opinion? Was it Chris's fault he died? Or did nature simply roll some bad dice on his turn? Different lessons and opinions can be formed from such a deep, controversial, real life topic.<br /><br /> In my personal opinion, this book was a great book and taught me a lot. Many people, including myself, have this nagging feeling once in awhile that they should just pick up and leave, start a new lifesomewhere else as a new person. This book talks about different cases in which, to a degree, this happened. It taught me that you can go into the wild on your own, but you need to be very well educated on where you're going, camping, survival, etc.,  and also that not everyone can do it. But again, this book can be understood in several different manners. This is a book that should be read with an open mind, being that it is a confusing, but deep, book. That being said, unless you have completed your pursuit of happiness and that you are completely happy with how your life is and you want your life to stay exactly how it is, every single teenager with a good reading comprehension should read this book. It'll change how you perceive a lot of things in life, including that little rebellious phase teenagers go through that adults like to call the adolescent phase.

B007JCP8FE|5.0|It's hard for bands to continue to grow and evolve without alienating their core fans.  With \\"Amaryllis,\\" Shinedown has continued to challenge themselves creatively, without getting too far away from what makes them great.  Brent delivers vocally as well as ever, although he doesn't hit as many high notes or sing with as much of a growl as he has on previous albums.  Personally it doesn't bother me, since his unaffected voice is just as powerful and fits better with the songs on this record.  When the time is right he still wails though, which makes those moments even more powerful.<br /><br />The songwriting is melodic and catchy, but still showcases the aggressive side of the band.  The biggest difference I noticed was the presence of more layers behind the main instruments.  There are lots of keyboards and orchestral elements that weren't in previous Shinedown records, however the new songs that feature these additions are also the more dramatic ones on the album, so they fit.<br /><br />All in all, another great album!

0446572993|5.0|Wow! This book was riveting and well written, with twist, turns and lots of suspense! It was so good I could not put it down until I finished it. Thank you David!!
1401233384|5.0|I pretty much read this whole book in one day!!! It was such a good story!!!! It was so convincing and enticing, bizarre, yet clear and concise. It was one of those stories that could have gone on and on, delving into every little detail until the point of tedium, but instead, Geoff Johns took a complex story, explained everything clearly, and left you at the edge of your seat the whole time!!! Geoff Johns is amazing. Anyone else would have gotten you completely lost in the story. It was so exciting!! It felt like I was reading about a parallel universe!!!! I don't really want to give anything away, but I will say that Geoff really gives an interesting and new perspective to the characters that we all love, and it is filled with surprises! It is a combination of thrill, excitement, anticipation, happiness, sadness, devastation, hope, and more! I was very happy with the ending, and now I really want to get into the side stories (i.e. - World of Flashpoint featuring Batman, Wonder Woman, Superman, etc.). Highly recommended. Any comic book fan needs to check this one out!!! You don't wanna miss it!!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Read all 3 books in 2 weeks, then re-read the first two!  Loved this series.  I disagree with the person who said \\"who would love a book that features a woman being abused.\\"  She will willing and ready, as I would be for Christian Grey!!

1439127700|5.0|I highly recommend this book for anyone that is even remotely interested in Presidential politics or the history of the Presidency itself.<br />The Presidents Club tells not only the many ways that former Presidents have become valuable assets to the current office holder, but also how once entering the world's most exclusive fraternity partisan politics becomes secondary to protecting the legacy of the Presidency itself.<br />How Herbert Hoover goes from disgraced President to respected elder statesman with the help of Harry Truman,the cloak and dagger events between Johnson and Nixon in the days leading up to the 1968 election,and the unlikely strong and almost father son relationship that has developed between Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush are just a few of the fascinating stories you will read about in this book.<br />To those that read it...you'll be glad you did!

B00785P2QC|5.0|best game ever<br />I love every thing about it especially that it will work even when my kindle is off
B00004RFFI|2.0|This is a brainless film.  Seriously, if you have anything approaching a decent IQ, avoid it.  The plot seems like it was put together by monkeys pulling cliche after cliche out of a box.<br />Early CG effects hold up decently.  The gas tanker is probably the worst of the bunch, but still- good work there guys.<br />Several likable actors.  I don't know who to blame for this waste of time.  I guess I'll choose the director for poor performances from the cast and the script writers for one of the worst plots ever.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I absolutely love this game....its everything I could want...until...the timer glitched!  Please Amazon...fix it....PLEASE!!!<br /> I even started the game over in hopes it would work and it didn't...so please Amazon fix IT!
B00005JLKB|5.0|This series is awesome. I had low expectations- but this show does almost everything right. I wish I had started watching it earlier than now (2007). I expected low budget & fair effects from a (then) fledgling \\"network.\\" The pilot blew me away. And it went on from there to do what it does best- it makes every character from this comic phenomenon HUMAN. Including, ironically, Clark Kent himself. The actor is great- plays him as so naive and trusting- you can't help but like this dude. And Lex- Man- this actor portrays Luthor better than ANY movie incarnation. You want to like this guy- and yet you're still a bit afraid of what he might do. Maybe it's because they have time to develop this character. The movies only portray a stereotype of what we expect form L.L.- an evil smart guy- no depth. The show makes you care for almost everyone. Great acting from everyone- but I think ultimately the producers & directors are responsible for this being the best 1st season of a show ever. Only one negative- the EXTRA features on disc 6 SUCK!!! Probably because of the age of the release.
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been hoping the app would come to kindle. It is great!!! Works perfectly! grandkids are ecstatic. I love my kindle!!
1400032717|3.0|I don't regret reading this book at all.  Although I did find myself getting very upset with the lack of detail, and the jumpy aspect of the narrator.  This book isn't bad, it's just very - well unchallenging.  Doesn't make you think, wonder, or investigate... Very straight forward and quite cliched.  I found myself at more than one point waiting for the story to begin and then realizing that I was most of the way through the book.  But it made me laugh and held my attention form start to finish.  I mostly give it 3 stars due to the fact that I was hoping for something a little more stimulating.
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm al glad they finally made this for the Amazon store. I have a kindle fire and it works great on it. I love this game and I love that it was free!!! I would definately recommend this app to anyone.

1594489505|4.0|I teach a class on interpersonal violence for nurses at a state university. A student recommended this book. I was really looking for a good novel for a rainy weekend, but the material facinated me. Best decision in a long time.<br /><br />This heartfelt story was so deeply emotional, but truly historical/real. I wish there was a sequel. It took you from early years, just giving enough real data all the way through 9-11. I never lost interest. While avoiding political commentary so the reader has their own opinion, I think this may be the best way to educate folks in the US about what has, and is, happening in Afganistan. A great novel.<br /><br />I was also quite comfortable in recommending it to my 14-year old grandaughter.
0525478817|5.0|A coworker of mine said this book was just amazing and after seeing all of these great reviews, I had to try.  I have VERY mixed feelings about how I feel about this book.  I read to be entertained - not to feel sad or like my gut is being ripped out.  The writing is superb.  The characters are very funny and their dialog back and forth is snappy, clever - not cheesy or boring.  The parents are wonderful \\"people\\" - I only wish I could be as good of parents as they are in such a tough situation with their daughter sick....<br />However, it's just a ridiculously sad book.  I would never pick up a story about someone's battle with cancer. I lost my father and most recently my best friend to cancer and it really made me sad to read this.  But I almost wish I could have past this story on to her to read - since the book tries to make comedy out of it and shows how you can live has hard as you can even as your body is dying.  I know I could never read this again but I'm not mad that I did....

B007J4T2G8|1.0|Why is this trilogy a best seller? I barely got through the first chapter, and I returned the book (Kindle version). It's full of sloppy, silly, juvenile writing from an author who should be renamed Captain Obvious, since it was clear exactly where the plot was going within just a few pages. What a waste of money. I just don't get all the hype for this junk food.

B0083GQ2A0|1.0|Well I wanted to see this.. looked like some kinda remake of Alive. Totally worse. If you have any knowledge of wolf behaviour you wont like this. totally unrealistic.

B007MJ9LA2|2.0|I play the congas and so I really enjoy listening to santana. I love all the percussion and I love the latin beat that is so prevalent in his music. I pre-ordered this album and waited impatiently for it to arrive. When it came I immediately tore it open and dropped it into my cd player. What a huge disappointment!!! It sounded nothing like the santana that I have learned to love. In fact it wasn,t until about the 7th or 8th song that it sounded even remotely like santana. It wasn,t until the 8th or 9th song that I even heard a conga being played!!! I have santana albums that I have played literally hundreds of times. I dont think that I will even play this one a second time.
B000VMBXNA|3.0|This was recommended to me by a friend who said it was 'so funny!'  It's a sweet little book, very short - I read it in a couple of hours.<br />Chuckled a few times and the premise is cute. It's written by a British playwright.  Not heavy duty literature, and not suitable for book discussion groups.<br />Still, it was OK and different.
B0086700CM|5.0|finally after w3eks of waiting for temple run to come to kindle its finally here its also a good game

B0086700CM|5.0|I don't think it's fair to give a game only one star, just because you already have it. It's a great game, deserves 4-5 stars!
0307346617|4.0|The book is a bit of an episodic read, which I did not mind since I couldn't read the entire thing in a couple days.  All the stories do mash up to create a clear view of the entire world at war and is linear in nature.  Giving 4 stars since I wasn't really invested in any characters in the book. Well worth the read.
B000BC8STC|4.0|I picked up \\"James Brown: Live at Montreux\\" from the bargain DVD rack at a nearby Ross Store. I remembered him from way back. To be honest, I never particularly cared for James Brown but I'd seen him on TV performances and he always put on an interesting show. As such, I picked up the DVD.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about this DVD. I'd say it's somewhat marginal in quality. I've seen worse live concerts, I might add. I'd almost say this performance comes in two parts. The first half is quite good. Brown is really on and puts everything he has into about a half-dozen songs. The man is amazing. His sense of rhythm and timing is exquisite and the camera work really picks it up. Brown and his band (5 piece horn section, guitar, bass, drums and 3 singers/dancers) really do their stuff and it's fun watching. Brown is sweating profusely and I began to wonder how much weight he loses in a concert. Does he take a time-out to re-hydrate?<br /><br />In any case, the second half of the concert seems to peter out, or maybe it's my interest that wanes. There's a long section that honors dead entertainers, for example. Then there's a bunch of partial songs plus a lot of audience participation. Well, I don't go to a concert or watch one for the audience participation. Then there's the Brown ego thing. The words \\"James Brown\\" were uttered at least 100 times. No, make that 150. It just get to be too much and it cuts down on the music that I want to hear. The concert seemed to get longer and longer and of less interest as it progressed. Based on the first half, I'd rate the DVD as 4 stars, but the second half would be no better than a three. Add them together into a 3 1/2. OK, I was entertained, so I'll raise it to 4 stars.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B000002HPV|5.0|So many musicians can change lives. When I look back at the time of release of this album it just had longevity oozing out the speakers.  And yep. About 15 years later it still sounds oh so good.  This is my kind of album.  Haunting, free thinking, and flows like honey.  One smoking track one after another.  I Think this may have been the pinnacle of her career and she still has the potential of making an album just as well if not better.  Oddly enough from a guy's perspective.  This album really helped me get over a first love experience in high school.  I listened to it over and over again with a crushed heart. And it healed me in time quite a lot. Maybe for that reason alone sure I will admit.  This is probably my favorite album that I have yet heard and ever heard in my life.  A thank you note to Bjork and affiliates.  Tune upwards.  Tune onwards.  Peace.

0307387178|2.0|To the average person, walking away from humanity would seem completely absurd. Chris McCandless is not the average person. Into the Wild by Jon Krakauer is the nonfiction story of a man, Chris McCandless, who completely marches to the beat of his own drum. He walks away from everyday society and starts a new take-it-as-it-comes lifestyle. McCandless believes that there is more to life then \\"plastic\\" people and monetary concerns. He wants to experience the world as itself.<br /> Chris is desperate for an adventure. He graduated from Emory University in Atlanta, Georgia, with a degree in anthropology, and has a strong interest in nature. Normal society, where everything is already definite, begins sickening Chris, so he decides to go on an adventure where society will not set standards. He knows the world has more to give him. Slowly but surely, Chris begins backing away from his friends and family, until he finally takes off. At first, he takes small and frequent trips, but later he takes much longer and greater ones. The rest of the McCandless family had reason to be concerned when they were told that Chris wanted to go on a big adventure, as he was not street smart and had a tendency to act without thinking. They had enough faith in him, however, to let him go on this journey. Little did they know, Chris was gone for good.<br /> Although this story is crazy and entertaining, the book was written extremely poorly. Jon Krakauer makes Into the Wild awfully hard to follow.  For example, he jumps from year to year in a random order. In one sentence, it is 1986, but the next paragraph takes you to 1992. Krakauer also includes too many stories within this one book. Although the tale is supposed to be concerning Chris McCandless, it includes stories of Gene Rosselini, John Waterman, and Carl McCunn as well. The author also includes an experience of his own, which makes the book even tougher to follow. Keeping track of the McCandless story alone is difficult, but adding another four stories to that makes the reading impossible.<br /> There is no doubt that the story of Chris McCandless is an unusual one. He took a risk that no sane person would dare take. Unfortunately, Jon Krakauer does poor job writing about it. Into the Wild contains enough information and storylines to write an additional three paperbacks. Time is difficult to keep track of, and Krakauer constantly bombards the reader with details. Reading this book is a chore.  If you are an adventurous person who likes minutiae, this book is for you. Otherwise, it is not one I recommend.

B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love temple run! it is the best game ever! I will play it whenever I want. and trust me, I want to play it a lot.
B0086700CM|5.0|This game rocks! The fact it came out later was bad but other than that it is AWESOME!!! I think honestly it should've came out sooner.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|i bought the cover hoping, specifically, that the strap would make it easier to hold my kindle while reading.  unfortunately i'm a creature of habit <=(that's the polite way of saying anal retentive) and, while the strap helps if you hold the device in your right hand, i hold it in my left making the strap useless for the purpose for which i'd intended.  (the strap's off enough to the side that it matters.)  i thought about turning the cover \\"upside-down\\" but it then blocks access to the connections.<br /><br />i also use a stylus.  the cover i currently own has a zippered pocket on front which is perfect for storing the stylus.  the solid material of this case doesn't allow for stylus storage.<br /><br />i will defend the cover, however, by saying that i found NO sharp edges (as people have said) the material is NOT flimsy, the stand worked just fine, and i found it very, very easy to insert and remove the kindle from the very snug fit of the case.<br /> and the pink color i chose was perfect if that matters to anyone.  :]
B0086700CM|5.0|This game provides a sense of adventure and action. I love this game so much. I play it al the time.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I agree with most of the other reviews. This is a fun solitaire game, but the pop up ads seem to be excessive at times  and are quite annoying.  I do love the many options with the game and will continue to play it.
B0086700CM|4.0|this is one good game just a little slow at times but its wwell worthit I give this game an 8 out of 10 its a fun game to put you out of boredum but after a while it gives me a head ache wish it didn't so I could play much longer at a time.
B000QE1U9K|5.0|This movie is classic, it's absolutely awesome and I have no idea why a lot of people didn't like it. It's called evolution. It is 200 years after Aliens, so of course it's going to look and be different than the last one, I would hope that every 200 years things do change a bit.<br /><br />The beginning is so haunting and it makes you really sad especially if you enjoyed Aliens. It puts you into a somber mind frame of knowing things didn't turn out with a happy ending. But then you move on and see lots of action and gore. Oh and the ending is incredible. From the music to the way Ripley is stands, to the look on her face, the look on Bishop's face, everything is just like \\"WOW\\". Very haunting and somber again.<br /><br />Even though it's a bit somber in the beginning and the end, it makes sense that this is the right direction for the movie, even though it hurts and makes you wonder \\"WHY!\\", you know that this is how it's suppose to happen because it just makes sense.<br /><br />It's a really great movie with so many deep moments and gives you things to think about. It's really special and a classic!!
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|really enjoyed playing angry birds but after two weeks my tablet went on the blink so it is worth the app.I will purchase it again when I get a better tablet.
141694737X|5.0|I got this book for the baby I watch when he was 18 months old. I had never heard him say the word \\"no\\" until we were reading Where's Spot, and he said no for each flap. Since he loves lift-the-flap books, I got him this one for Christmas. Fast forward to 23 months, and he still loves it and knows all the animals. It is ADORABLE when he says elephant or \\"tamel\\". I am off to look for more Rod Campbell books because the other \\"Spot\\" books don't look like something he would like as much.<br /><br />This one is very repetitive, so it is best for toddlers, not preschoolers. and it is pretty sturdy, but with all flap books, you might be using tape! So far baby hasn't broken this one, and I think  he has outgrown the tearing stage
B0086700CM|5.0|I have been waiting for it to come out on the kindle fire and it finally did. yessssssss!!!! This game is so addictive! I think it is great for all ages.  I think you should get this awesome app for sure. I play it all the time.
B0085YNML2|5.0|I love this app its soooo addicting. totally worth it. most games get boring very quickly but not this one! I absolutely love this game its super cute and good for people of all ages
B0056TYT66|1.0|I tried installing this in a Dell T7400 Xeon computer. Once installed, I applied power and the power supply just clicks. I tried without the sata power to the card, but had the same results. This same slot had a pci express usb3 card that works.<br /><br />Now to return this it has to go to North Carolina then onto Ireland. It takes weeks before it is checked and they decide if a refund or replacement will be in order.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Not my typical type of book but I enjoyed it very much. After the way book one ends you almost have no choice but to read book two.  I thought it might not be as good as the first but fortunately it didn't disappoint. It's been a while since I read a book that was hard to put down.
B0086700CM|4.0|fun to play! it can be a little boring at times because it doesn't seem to have a finish but at least it has objectives to keep you interested.
B0086700CM|5.0|you need to have a good tablet to play this game like a kindle fire to play some others tablets suck
0345803485|1.0|This was the most disappointing erotica fiction I have ever read. It makes me sick that this book and author is getting so much attention when talented writers like Maya Banks, Opal Carew and Larissa Ione have been entertaining audiences for years with their hot topics and menage love scenes. Poo Poo.
B006GH6IS4|3.0|This is the kind of rock documentary that is more for the casual Queen fan, and not the hardcore fan that would expect the group to go into greater detail of other tracks from their albums.<br /><br />The main part of this documentary are in two \\"one hour\\" parts.  Part One covered their most powerful and popular era of their career.  The seventies.  From Queen's debut album up to \\"The Game\\", which is my main concerned era of the band.  But, to talk about 8 great albums in only one hour, caused them to only discuss the hit songs from these eight albums, and they didn't even mention all the many hits of that era.  If you had this documentary, and only their \\"greatest hits\\" CD, and if you knew nothing else of Queen, you would really only get into the first hour of this documentary.<br /><br />I wanted to hear more about the fabulous songs on \\"Sheer Heart Attack\\", \\"A Night at the Opera\\" and \\"Day at the Races\\" and a discussion and perhaps some session performances of these tracks in the raw. The bonus extras talk a little bit more about the separate albums, but very little.  I really wanted to have more.<br /><br />Now, on the Part Two of the main documentary, they started strong with \\"Under Pressure\\" with David Bowie, but then quickly revolved in the band losing their familiar style and appeal to the rock world, and then also, the quick decline or Freddie Mercury's health.  They spent a long portion of an hour on that subject alone.  It dragged, and it even bored me, but most of all, it depressed me.  I wanted to hear a celebration of the works of \\"Queen\\", not go deeply into Freddie Mercury's declining health, and to see his sickly final moments. I found part two of this documentary extremely \\"unentertaining\\". They had a few successful concerts, but their albums through the eighties weren't selling their sound like they had in the seventies.<br /><br />There is an excellent DVD on \\"Queen: the making of \\"A Night at the Opera\\".  Now, I would love to have a separate DVD of all eight of their first albums, individually. But, that's not gonna happen.<br /><br />I have Queen's CD box set \\"The Crown Jewels\\" (the first eight albums), and I have their Blu-Ray release of their 1982 concert in Montreal, Canada.  I guess that's all the Queen that I need.  I probably won't play this Queen documentary again, unless I were to have a friend over who'd like to watch it.  I would certainly give a verbal fore-warning because this documentary can leave you feeling depressed about the legacy of Queen.  I've seen things now, that I wish I hadn't.<br /><br />So, be prepared for some emotional disappointment with this documentary.  You certainly won't stand up and cheer. And that's a fact.all eight of their first albums, individually.

B00514HDNW|4.0|Although this book has vampires in it, its really about how the human spirit can endure and the physical body can keep going even when it seems pointless.  I found it to be inspiring, even though it truly paints a desolate picture of the \\"future\\" (the book takes place in 1976, but was written in the 50's).  I think this book must have played a key role in the development of Justin Cronin's \\"The Passage\\", in fact I found the similarities striking; so if you enjoyed \\"The Passage\\" and are looking forward to Cronin's next book \\"The Twelve\\", you will like this.  It is a quick read, and well worth the time!

B0086700CM|5.0|I absolutely love this app! I have been waiting for an app like Tiny Wings or some other Apple app to come out on Android and it did! This app is probably just as addictive as facebook. I stayed up until like... 11:00 on a school night playing this! Its in my favorites on my kindle fire and I play at the least 30 games a day. I may seem like a nerd because I say that I play that many games a day,  but Im not... trust me. I'm a girl. Girls don't play games all day like nerds. Anyway,  I love this app. You should totally get it while its free because they are gonna start charging because its so popular.

B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game. I play it every day with my brother. I wish every game console would have this game.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I was so excited to see this game in the app store and even more excited to see it was tree! As a child in computer class we used to play this game!
B0086700CM|5.0|get it now and have the time of ur life go by fast...:) they should make more games like this...:)
B0086700CM|5.0|I usually download a game and tire of it really quickly... but I've been playing this one for 3 days and I still love it.
1439153663|2.0|I wanted to like this book however, I did not! I am an avid reader and read all the time. Fortunately, I checked this book out from the library. It's one of the most depressing books I've ever read - rapes, murders, children dieing, insane people, drug abuse, more rapes, and people who don't have a clue about others even though they've watched them grow up with rape, incest, etc. Vague character development. There isn't one character I valued as a human being. This would probably make a good mini-series for television. And the depressing events just keep piling on and on. I'm so happy to be finished with this book.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|The characters are fully developed. Story line is moving. Location is gorgeous! All together a very entertaining show. I was sorry there weren't more episodes!
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! Its about time they put it on the kindle. I would recommend  this game to anyone.

B007L96SI6|5.0|I don't often, or should I say rarely write reviews on here. However, Ms. Reinhart deserves a nod for her strong 1st album debut. Every song on the album is great. My personal favorite is Keep Coming Back; her voice really shines. She delivers her raspy, sassy, but sexy vocals. The song is lyrcially good as well.These are my favorite stand outs in no particular order:<br /><br />1. Oh' MY!<br />2. Liar<br />3. Now That You're Here<br />4. Keep Coming Back (my fav)<br />5. Hit The Ground Runnin'<br />6. Undone<br /><br />I knew this girl had talent ever since she took the stage on American Idol. Randy kept on pushing her, putting her to the corner. But she showed him. I played this album several times, and it just keeps coming back to my radio!
B0086700CM|5.0|I'm so glad that they made a temple run for the kindle I've been waiting so long! Go Temple Run!!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved the trilogy. Even the author admits the writing is elementary at best and they edited her. That being said its a fantasy.....a love story and one that shouldn't be taken so literally. It's a great escape book and  since so many loved this trilogy to make it a best seller phenomena many were in need of this type of escapism from the crapola most face day in and day out. The critics must have wondeerful lives and have no need to lose themselves in a fantasy where love conquers all. Fairy tale maybe but I'll take it over the murder and hate of each other that gets pushed in our faces daily. Thank you for the escape. Stop taking life so seriously....she never claimed to be a literary scholar!
B0086700CM|5.0|Ive been waiting for this game forever I was tired of playing it on my friends phone and getting them new high scores old I'm so happy
0307951529|5.0|I have been a long time fan of Chris' work both on his blog and his book, \\"The Art of Non-Conformity.\\"  This book went way beyond my expectations in giving concrete examples of real entrepreneurs who have succeeded. I garnered two specific ideas I have implemented myself and found all of the stories to be really motivating.
0547258305|4.0|I'm not a fantasy fan at all.  ...  Most of the time I hate made up names and places in books and the little maps at the beginning of such books don't usually help.  Sure enough, after two chapters of Graceling I was ready to give up, but I plowed ahead so I would have something to say on Saturday night.<br /><br />But you'll notice above I gave the book four stars.  How is this possible?  Well, I'll tell you, by about a third of the way through I was actually enjoying the novel!  And by about half way through, I didn't even want to put it down.  It quickly became a \\"stay up until 2 am and just finish it!\\" kind of night.  You know a fantasy book is good when I actually like it!<br /><br />Graceling is a coming-of-age novel about a young Graceling named Katsa.  Gracelings have two different eye colors and special powers that could be as mundane as nothing, or super-powerful and extremely useful like the ability to kill, survive, or sense other through walls.  Since Katsa is the King's niece, she is often forced to use her Grace to his benefit, killing foes or at least threatening them, but this isn't the life Katsa wants.  Deep down she's much more peaceful and wants to put her Grace to use for good, not bad.<br /><br />That's pretty interesting in and of itself, and I did enjoy learning about how Graces worked.  But, being the hot-blooded female that I am, there was something a little more interesting to me in this novel... and his name was Po.<br /><br />Oh, Po.  *swoon*  If you thought Edward Cullen was dreamy, you were wrong.  You must read Graceling and swoon over Po.  Everything about him is adorable: his name, the way he puts Katsa before himself, the way he wants to protect her even though she's a million times stronger than him... I could go on.  Of course, Po is extremely interested in Katsa, but Katsa has sworn of marriage and babies.  Yet at the same time, she's drawn to Po as well.  Oh sexual tension, love it!<br /><br />One of my favorite characters wasyoung Bitterblue, Po's cousin who must be saved from her evil father.  Bitterblue was only ten years old, but she was strong and lovable.  She was very well spoken for a child her age and had an infallible sense of right from wrong.  The third book in this series focuses on her and I'm excited to read that eventually and learn more about her.<br /><br />This book goes to prove you cannot judge a book by it's beginning.  Three or fours stars - that was the question.  Well, after sleeping on it last night I'm giving it four stars because once I finally got into the novel (about one third of the way through) I had a definite sense of un-put-down-ability.  I will be continuing on with the series at some point, though I think I'm more eager to read Bitterblue than Fire.  If you're a huge fantasy fan though, I guarantee you're going to love this book and you should definitely give it a look.
B000WQWPKA|5.0|Great Movie. Great Quality. Great Price. It all came together to get this one on Blu-Ray. It is a classic plus is looks and sounds even better in Blu-Ray. A must have to check out any system!
B003UMW69I|5.0|This items was top quality. It was a decent price. It shipped quickly and arrived when stated. The product is flawless and works as expected. Very happy with this choice!
B002E2M5IC|2.0|I give it a 2 only because of a couple of interesting scenes and good camera work.  Loved Fargo and Big Lebowski, liked other Coen Brothers movies.  This is the first that I really didn't like.  No plot and no real meaning, which would be ok if it were funny, but it wasn't.
0345803485|1.0|I had just finished a book series and was looking for something light to read. It was suggested to me, many times over, to read Fifty Shades. \\"It's an erotic love story...\\" I was told... Great! Sounds like fun. I got even more excited when I heard it was somehow connected or similar to Twilight, my guilty pleasure read. Well, I guess it was sort of, maybe a little fun for like 5 seconds.<br /><br />I hate to say mean things about somebody's art that they have put out there. She had the guts to make herself vulnerable which I cannot say I have done, but seriously? I'm seeing 4 and 5 stars and thinking, \\"who the hell actually enjoyed this series this much?\\"<br /><br />Everyone loves a fairy tale. I mean, really... this man is rich, good looking, knows how to blow dry AND braid your hair, exceptional in the sack, wants nothing more than to spoil and protect you, doesn't even notice other beautiful women. Oh, and he's paid millions for therapy for his rough start to life, but after all that, YOU are his only cure. Gag me.<br /><br />Not only is the story line just a little too far fetched to indulge in the fantasy, but the writing is so basic. The first sex scene is tolerable at best, but then every single one after that uses the same words! I swear she changes the location and toys, but describes it otherwise in the same way over, and over, and over again. \\"He brushed against my sex...\\" Really? No thesaurus on hand? All she has to do is bite her lip and he's falling apart, desperate to \\"take her\\" - another commonly used phrase - right then and there. Be it in the elevator, the car, the couch. And he announces it... \\"I'm going to take you now...\\" He also announces almost every time when he wants her to \\"let go\\" and like magic, she comes all over him and they're ready to start again.<br /><br />There are a few weak sub plots (also too far fetched to really connect with) but other than that it's a bunch of naughty emails and texts and trips to the play room. Using the same words almost every time. If not for all the repetition (which I was going to name, but so many others already have), this book would seriously be like 20 pages.<br /><br />I can't believe they are making a movie.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|As most other people will agree, this is a wonderful movie.  Everyone I know that has also watched it says the same thing.  Simply captivating!

0439023483|4.0|This is a great book! When I read a book I look for a plot that keeps me guessing, keeps me awake at night because I have to finish it, and a story that makes me want to read more.  The Hunger Games was that book.  Not because of the movie or hype (which is due!), but because the story is fast paced, you connect with the character, and it has something for everyone.  Slightly tragic, a little romance, tons of action, a little political thrill (which comes up even more later in the series), and a great futuristic feel.  It is Orwell's 1984 meets Gladiator.  The Hunger Games is a great read that I highly recommend.

B007N0REX6|5.0|UPDATE NOV. 2013: Below is my initial review and I stand by it. Now that time has passed and others have chimed in I was curious what those that rated this 1 star had to say and their reasoning. Other than --Axl love/loyalty-- I can't find any qualified reasoning. This IS NOT GnR hence why it is titled SLASH! The present GNR is NOT GNR and if dishonesty is to be cited it should fall upon Axl. What made AFD what it was was Slash, Izzy, Axl and Duff in various but not equal parts. I have followed all of the mentioned solo works. I would say the balance of Izzy's more Rolling Stones and Slash's energy is probably the largest contributors to the music. Axl hired solid musicians to mimic what the band later did on the Use Your Illusion set and from that came Chinese Democracy. I enjoy it but it isn't GNR and if Axl had real balls and respect for his fans he would fly under the AXL ROSE banner rather than leach of the GUNS N ROSES name. Axl manipulated the others to sign over their rights to the name and band ---read the collective biographies--- which gives him LEGAL right to use GNR but it isn't and never will be without Slash, Duff and Izzy. I felt the need to point that out to those bashing Slash out of misplaced loyalty to Axl. A fan can appreciate BOTH but if you come to Axl, Slash, Izzy or Duff expecting AFD #2 you'll be disappointed.<br /><br />This has the edge of the original GnR yet has it's own identity as well. I loved the 2 Slash Snakepits then came that abortion group with Scott, then the first Slash....which I liked but am less a fan of the multiple guest singer deal and NOW we are here and Myles is a perfect fit for this blistering music I defy anyone that loved Appetite For Destruction NOT to love! I'm not saying it's a clone of that as there will never be another AFD from Slash, Izzy, what Axl calls GnR these days or even if the originals tried. I'm just telling you that vibe is here.
B0086700CM|4.0|this game is highly addictive and loads of fun. it's easy to play too.  I would recommend this. game to anyone.

B000RODI7G|1.0|I went into my local Barnes and Noble yesterday and bought volume one of Sir Aurthur Conan Doyles great Sherlock Holmes Stories at a bargain price of 8 dollars. and saw this edgar allen poe book in the bargain prices isle as well. It is black and gold leather bound with silver lined pages and i immediately wanted it. i however couldnt afford to buy another book and go out with the guys that night so i decided to wait, maybe check out some online prices. Normally i love amazon but whoever thinks this book is going to sell for 45 bucks when you can literally get it at Barnes and Noble for 20 is either a genius, swindler, or both.
B0086700CM|3.0|I really enjoyed playing this game on my i-phone. I got it on my kindle and it is still fun but it has some glitches that mess up the game.
B0086700CM|5.0|this one is a 100% thrill ride. me and my son were hooked the moment we played this. Temple Run is now at the top of the list on both our Kindle Fires.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is brilliant! it is so much fun! I love being able to buy new Color packs and being able to interact with your friends. Get this app :)

0345803485|3.0|This book was almost impossible to rate.<br /><br />On the one hand, I wanted to give her Five Stars just for the huge amount of press she was able to generate for this genre of book. On the other, I wanted to give her one star for seemingly mixing Twilight-esque teen writing with serious BDSM. And while she's liberal in using the F-bomb, she leaves a lot left to the imagination -- and this can be both a good thing and a bad thing.<br /><br />It's also a bit disconcerting to read about a virgin recent college grad, Anastastia, who captivates a 20-something year old billionaire, Christian. I've heard of Lana Turner being discovered in a soda shop, but this is an entirely different animal. Anne Rice (writing under various pen names) wrote about BDSM the way it probably deserves to be written about -- and this ain't it. The premise (and writing style) is on such a juvenile level that I kept thinking it was a teen book until woah Nelly, out come the whips and restraints and the F bombs. That discontinuity was jarring, to say the least.<br /><br />Also, if you turned the book into a drinking game and took a shot every time the author wrote \\"murmur\\", you'd be drunk in three pages. Add to that the annoying and constant reference to her computer as \\"the mean machine\\", biting her lower lip so often you're surprised it hasn't been bitten off yet, all the eye-rolling, overuse of the word \\"clamber\\" (which, in my not so humble opinion, should *never* be used in an erotic text), and Christian's sudden departure from ten-year past of strong BDSM to considering a major change for Ana -- well. It was hard to know whether to laugh, roll my OWN eyes, or keep reading. The book is not the best of this genre I've ever read by far.<br /><br />Yet, I couldn't look away.<br /><br />I'm not sure what that says about either me OR the book. I'll finish the trilogy, but I'm certain the story won't change, the style won't rise above a fifth-grade level -- but the author has SOMETHING here, and whatever it is, I'll give the next book a chance.hatever it is, I'll give the next book a chance.
B006P3HXZG|5.0|I saw this video in walmart as a display of their Vizio 3d tv's.  I bought a Vizio tv and this video and love to watch both!  I sold my blu ray copy (non 3d) on our garage sale for $10  Great Movie - Even Better in 3D!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I have waited to long for this to come out on the kindle. I am so excited thank you Imangi Studios!
B007JRU2UK|2.0|Dark film dealing with death and infidelity. Dad is out of touch with his children.  Family bickering with a teenage girl being rude & ugly is not that fun to watch. Do people find this entertaining? Seemed slow and dull to me.  Halfway through I wondered, \\"What's the point?  Is this leading anywhere?\\"  It seems aimless. This film does not measure up to other 2012 Oscar Best Picture nominees like The Help, Margin Call, Midnight in Paris, Moneyball, and War Horse. Those are all far better films. Skip this one, and watch one of those instead! Apparently, somebody connected to this film really knows how to play the Hollywood/Oscars politics game, to somehow get the awards this turkey generated. Not recommended.
B0086700CM|5.0|this app is very and very addictive. U will want to beat ur high score every time u play! very awesome!
B0055PMURG|4.0|Inspiring film! True story of surfer Bethany Hamilton, who had a tragic accident. Contains some beautiful surfing cinematography.  Some reviewers here say the spiritual element was over the top.  Other reviewers say it was too subtle.  I thought it was handled just right. Good job by entire cast & crew. Really enjoyed this film. Highly Recommended.<br /><br />Edit Review<br />Delete Review
B0086700CM|5.0|it finally came out for the kindle its woo awesome I Thout it was going to just be on the apple store but boo more thank you for putting temple run on the kindle!
B007UXSPK2|4.0|I saw this in the theater, and had to rent it for a second viewing. This is my favorite of the MI series. Ghost Protocol is more enjoyable and more human partly because of the comedic relief of Benji (played by Simon Pegg), the tech guy on the MI team. The previous MI movies were too serious--almost no comedic relief. MI-3 was even morbid in the hostage segment that went on too long. This film is better, and includes some great action, stunts, and photography. Especially noteworthy is Tom Cruise climbing, running & jumping around on the glass outside one of Dubai's tallest buildings. There's a short fight scene between two hot females that is intense & authentic. Another fight sequence in an automated parking garage tower is really cool, and nicely choreographed. With this fourth outing of Mission Impossible, they finally got it just right. Recommended.
B0086700CM|5.0|fast paced and exciting and sometimes hard fun!!!! get it!!! if u love actilny and adventurous games this is the one for u!!!
B004LUS390|5.0|I'm incredibly impressed with this app. The depth of tools, colors and brushes for $2 is more than enough needed for any artist to create their vision.

B007JCP8FE|5.0|I really like Shinedown so I just bought this album as soon as it came out a while back with only hearing one or two songs. I listened to a few songs but not the whole album and set it aside for some reason and forgot about it. Then the other day I listened to it straight thru and holy .... I love it!!!! There are at least 4 songs on this album that are truly special IMO...I tend to really like the less super-hardcore rockers though. A nice combo of hard rockers and rock ballads.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|First of off, I have never written a review before, but I just couldn't resist after finding this series.  I'm extremely addicted to paranormal books, but the genre has gotten a little tiresome.  While searching for something new that wasn't erotica disguised as paranormal contemporary I found the Iron Druid.  The action is fast paced and written extremely well with LOL moments.  I find that a lot of writers cram the majority of plot twists at the end, but I felt that it was evenly spread.  I can't wait to read the next in the series.
B004LWZW8I|3.0|Would have been nice to see the movie. Why was most of it shot in the dark? A few dark scenes might have been tolerable but most of the movie?  I would like to have actually seen what was going on and not have to guess.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a great weather app.  The graphics are crisp and well displayed.  You can enter and track multiple locations.  Navigating is easy and very intuitive.  I had none of the glitches with functionality that others complained of in their review.
B006RED4GA|1.0|This was so slow and so dumb, I fell asleep. If it ever got good I wouldn't know.I struggled to watch it for 45 minutes and finally lost interest. The acting was bad, the story was lame, and the characters had no chemistry. It was a waste of money and time. Talk about 45 minutes of my life I will never get back. F-
B00846F1YW|5.0|there r a acouple bad reviews for this app but i gnored them and bought it anyway. its absolutely great i rlly enjoyed the game but i finished it in about 3 days. wish it were longer :)
B0086700CM|5.0|I know we all heard of it now you just need to get on the kindle.but yea this game has always been amazing no matter if it was on your friends phone or not but still AMAZING

B0086700CM|5.0|I've been waiting for this game to come out on the Kindle Fire forever! But unfortunately, it's not as popular with people as it was a few months ago. Regardless, I still love it and it was worth the wait! All the graphics and the controls work great and looks wonderful! Plays awesome!
B0086700CM|5.0|its fun when u challenge yourself to your scores or try to achieve more to gain better things for the game.  it works great on my kindle fire!
B00846F1YW|4.0|I would give this game 5 stars if not for two things : 1) you can't zoom in to find. those smaller items. and 2) when you use a hint it doesn't show up long enough.  If you don't know where to look you are SOL as they say.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great for comparing different versions for clarification of meaning. Found the reading plans very instructional as well. Our church uses the Live portion which is really nice
0307951529|5.0|I read Chris's other book, The Art of Non-Conformity, and immediately realized I had accidentally stumbled upon not just an education, but a movement.  With the $100 Startup, the education was highly fine-tuned.  These stories range from folks who started storefront businesses, to people working from home making money through their blogs & websites, to people who now travel the world while working and doing a range of things.... all doing what they love & all having something to offer the world.  It's fabulous.  I have always felt very anxious and nervous about the idea of working for myself.  After reading this book, I KNOW I can do it.  And I know that experience will be the ultimate teacher, but I feel pretty well equipped from the stories in this book and the author's story as well.  On top of that, I recently heard Chris speak at one of his book signings, and I have to add that the guy is just a smart, genuine, & awesome guy.  He put this book out because he really wants to help people find freedom, and I have to say... he didn't miss a beat with this one.
B004FEL6GO|4.0|This toy is pretty cool but it seemed bigger on the website. Probably my fault for not checking the sizes but I wish it were a little bigger.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! I mean there's a lot of stupid apps out there but this is not one of them!Temple Run is challenging and exciting! If u want 2 get it u should its worth it!
B000F7CMRM|5.0|\\"Syriana\\" is a geopolitical thriller film starring George Clooney as Bob Barnes who is a CIA field officer often stationed in the Middle East.<br /><br />The movie narrative contains several parallel storylines and at first they appear independent but come together precisely by the end of the film.<br /><br />Set in a number of countries many significant events occur in the Middle East and the viewer is presented with a plentiful story that includes: underhand dealings to obtain rights to oil fields, extreme prejudice decisions made by intelligence agencies, and the ease at which guilty and innocent people can be made expendable.<br /><br />It is a film that exposes tentacles of greed and ruthlessness that span corporations, governments, and extremists, all of whom are pushing their own agendas and squabbling over an insatiable appetite for resources.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W.

0316044695|1.0|Navy SEALs pride themselves on being more than just muscle.  Their elite status is supposed to be a result of physical training matched with the ability to think.  Marcus Luttrell betrays that ideal and shows himself to be a blunt object sent to kill without thought.  He clearly has no idea for what he is fighting.  Among his observations are that Abu Ghraib was not news worthy and that the rules of engagement should permit the US military to kill civilians without a second thought.<br /><br />When Luttrel finds himself in hostile territory without direction or support, he does not blame the politicians who decided to invade a country that resisted all invaders for thousands of years or the commanding officers that developed the strategy.  Instead, he creates a straw man out of the \\"liberal media\\" who somehow are responsible for every problem he faces.  This is not a single lament, but a continuous talking point throughout the book.  Best of all, he ends the book with a meeting with President G. W. Bush in which he recognizes the man as a \\"very great\\" president without any reflection on what role the man had in putting Luttrell into harms way.

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Adam Lambert's new album Trespassing is one of the best albums I have ever purchased. Every single song is fantastic. There really are no skippers on this album. The first half of the CD is pure dance pop candy and it is awesome. Adams' vocals are spectacular. The production is A+++. The second half is a little less dancey and has some absolute gems. Underneath is heart-wrenchingly beautiful along with Outlaws of Love. The bonus tracks, in my opinion could easily have been included on the CD as regular tracks. Runnin is a standout track which features Adams' lower register at the beginning and building up to a huge chorus. I love this song a lot. Its been on repeat. Overall, this CD has shown that Adam, as Executive Producer, knew what he wanted and he got there. If you like pop, dance music, you will not be disappointed in Trespassing.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I downloaded my first Tunein radio app about 2 years ago on my first android phone and up graded within days. I now have it on my phone and Kindle fire.<br />The selection of stations is fabulous! One can see the album cover on most stations. It has a great selection of podcasts and programs.  I highly recommend the Tunein radio app.
B001P9KR8U|4.0|Danny Boyle, who came to my attention from 28 days later, expands his reach here, and does so well. The story line is fascinating, although often contrived. But that really does not matter as much in this case. But the real star of the movie are the tones of color that permeate everything. It is a pleasure to watch, even when you know how things are going to turn out.
145162445X|5.0|Personally, I really enjoyed the book as well as the video lecture on You Tube. I am not a scientist or expert in the field but I was able to grasp the message being relayed to my satisfaction. I opened my first book on astronomy in 1965 at age 5 and I have been hooked on cosmology ever since. This book will appeal to others like myself who throughout life have enjoyed these thought provoking topics. It will especially appeal to those who have open minds and are not chained to and muzzled with religious dogma and it's associated parasitic philosophies. I have tried to stay as well informed on these cosmological topics as much as possible throughout the years. The \\"Why we have something rather than nothing\\" debate has plagued humankind's imagination for a very long time. I had hoped before the end of my life, to have some kind of idea what the purpose of our universe was and how and why we exist and became connected to it. The information in this book was exactly what I was looking for! Kudos! Dr Krauss for taking the time to educate and feed open and willing minds!
B004SIP9U6|5.0|First, this is a comedy, not a documentary, or serious work. It is a romantic comedy, and by those standards it succeeds wonderfully. It is smart, semi-historical (Marlowe, and John Webster, who did grow up to write some pretty macabre plays) although the first scene where Will is getting psychoanalyzed should tell you not to include anything from this movie on a term paper.<br /><br />But the acting is fine, the plot is delightful, and the directing is suburb. Geoffrey Rush gives a wonderful performance, and Ben Affleck does a pretty mean Ned Allyne. It is interesting to see Imelda Staunton of Harry Potter fame (Dolores Umbridge) and Jim Carter of Downton Abbey (Mr Carson) in very different roles.<br /><br />This is a great date night movie, smart yet entertaining. It does not try to be more than it is, and what it is is pretty good.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|Absolutely beautiful story about love.  I fell in live with Travis and Abby.  Their story is so captivating.  I laughed, cried, yelled...I loved it.  Great job Mrs. McGuire!
B005JABU82|5.0|Purchased this item for my 13 year old son at his request.  While it has a lot of very small parts and decals, he was able to complete it in about 4 days working on it for a couple of hours each day after school.  He really enjoyed building it and would like me to purchase another.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|This was a terrible series. I picked it up to read along with friends and co-workers and to see what all the media hype was about. The first book is all great sex .. but the story line is crap. It represents a weak female and a way controlling man. Makes me wonder about the author. If you like a total control man and a desperate female wanting to please this one man then this book is for you.
B0086700CM|5.0|not sure if its good or bad to have two devices to play this addicting game on now. Gotta beat coworkers score of 7.1 mil
B007J4T2G8|1.0|There is no character development. I mean none. By the end of this book I secretly hoped that she would kill off Anastasia and Christian because I thought it would make the book more interesting. The writing is so poor it's difficult to read.<br /><br />Everyone talks about how hot the book is, but the sex gets so repetitive that you stop being interested. The \\"apex of my thighs\\" is so over used (among numerous other sexual references) that I just started skimming over the sex scenes.<br /><br />Also, I can usually read a series of this size in 3 days. It took me over 2 weeks to suffer through these books with the hopes that somewhere there would be a redeeming quality. But alas, there was none and once finished I was pissed I even spent money on this trash.
B007H9B8FS|5.0|I didn't know Garbage had even released a new album until I saw it on the shelf at the store. I forgot how much I liked them. I heard Beloved Freak and thought is was beautiful. I downloaded the album today. Definitely my new favorite album. The World Is NEVER Enough.

1451627289|5.0|Why do I bother to publish a review of a book that already has had almost 1800 reviews?  Only because I enjoyed the book so much and feel satisfaction in  expressing the pleasure I derived from reading it. Firstly, \\"11/22/63\\" is not a horror novel nor is it a science fiction story.  It is a love story and one of the finest I have ever read.  If you don't fall in love with Sadie when you read this book, you are one cold fish.  Jake Epping, the protagonist. is not a common man. Is he a hero?  I will let you decide, but the question is relevant only to readers that have to put characters in categories. Epping is a man on a journey that has so many twists and turns, ups and downs, it could make a less resourceful man cry in frustration. But after you successfully suspend disbelief with respect to the time-travel aspect of the story, and this is not really not that difficult, there is nothing in the story that is not plausible. Some reviewers have criticized the ending of the book. One could argue for years about King's alternate future but it is not the destination that is important, it is the journey.  And the journey is rich and filled with memorable characters and events and some of the best writing that King has displayed in years.  When King is on his game, there is none better, in my opinion.  I bought the hardback when the book came out but was intimidated by the size and weight of the book.  It sat unread for weeks on my bookshelf. I like to read in bed, sometimes for hours into the early morning, and I was afraid this book would give me carpal tunnel syndrome. Then I got a Kindle as  gift and bought \\"11/22/63\\" for the Kindle reader.  Perfect!

B004LWZW7E|3.0|What if human beings had achieved immortality but it was only attained by being powerful? And what if most people had a 24 hour living period and had to renew it every day thereafter with services and the like? In essence buying your life had become the new currency of the world and there were also people thieving and conning others out of their mostly hard earned time? This dystopian setting focuses on such possibilities taking an interesting look at aging and generations basically fading away as everybody stays at one age over their lifetime(s). Timekeepers serve the powerful by making sure people stay to their segregated zones and never get ahead in life points. Everybody has a time clock on their inner forearm that clicks their life down to the last second.<br /><br />There's some comparison nods to the Occupy Wall Street movement, I suspect, as speeches are made about equal time payments for all rather than a few hoarding everything. A lot of interesting ideas but not nearly mined fully enough and some ideas don't make much sense or have serious plot holes. Amanda Seyfried, Justin Timberlake, Olivia Wilde, Cillian Murphy and Vincent Kartheiser are some of the notables in the picture. Seyfried felt very much underutilized and some of the dialogue was so mediocre at times that I wondered if this was intended mainly for the adolescent movement. Bad move, marketing people.<br /><br />CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: C plus to B minus; STORY/PLOTTING: C plus to B minus; MINES THE POTENTIAL IDEAS OF THE SCI FI TALE: B minus; OVERALL GRADE: C plus to B minus.

B002XTBE6K|5.0|This 2009 BBC miniseries of EMMA is, quite possibly, the loveliest screen version yet of the Jane Austen favourite.  Casting the principal roles with noticeably younger actors and featuring a sparkling screenplay by Sandy Welch (\\"North & South\\", 2006's \\"Jane Eyre\\"), this new \\"Emma\\" will, I'm sure, satisfy all those who hold the story dear.<br /><br />Emma Woodhouse (played in this version by the radiant Romola Garai) is one of Jane Austen's most singular heroines.  Unlike Elizabeth Bennet, the Dashwood sisters, Catherine Morland or Fanny Price, she is, at the start of the story, already in complete possession of her place in society and has her own fortune.  More pointedly, she doesn't require a husband.  Emma instead has made it her business to play matchmaker for her various family members and friends, and has most recently married off her beloved governess Miss Taylor (Jodhi May) to widower Mr Weston (Robert Bathurst).<br /><br />Her attention is now drawn to Harriet Smith (Louise Dylan), whom she grooms as something of a \\"prot&eacute;g&eacute;e\\", guiding the inexperienced girl through the pitfalls of finding the proper husband.  Emma is sure that she has found him in Mr Elton (Blake Ritson), but she is shocked when she learns that Elton is more interested in Emma herself!  Watching from the sidelines is Emma's dear old friend, Mr Knightley (Jonny Lee Miller)... could he be another possible match for Harriet?  Emma's manic hobby of playing cupid masks her own growing feelings for Knightley, but as the game draws on, she is forced to finally confront her own restless heart...<br /><br />Casting this version \\"younger\\" gives EMMA a newfound shine and sparkle, and I've been surprised at the amount of reviews on here which have criticised Romola Garai's performance in the title role. We've probably been spoiled by the poised, elegant Emma's of Kate Beckinsale and Gwyneth Paltrow (and to a lesser extent Doran Godwin's crisp, no-nonsense Emma in the '72 BBC miniseries).  Each actress has brought something unique to the part.  We need to remember that, in the book, Emma is barely out of her teens and as such probably wouldn't have had the sophistication or elan of a woman who was exposed to London society.  Unlike her older sister, Emma has spent her entire life at Highbury, and this would have significantly impacted her general day-to-day behaviour.  When the imperious Mrs Elton (Christina Cole) arrives on the scene, we can catch a glimpse of the clash between the \\"city\\" and \\"country\\" social attitudes, and the life Emma might have had if she indeed ventured on to London.<br /><br />I'm delighted to see Emma's sister and brother-in-law feature more prominently in the action here (in past versions they were always painted as passing, almost inconsequential characters).  Tamsin Greig's Miss Bates is depicted not as a doddery old spinster but instead a rather vital woman, probably still only in her late-40's (again something completely refreshing and a casting move I heartily applaud).  Jeremy Northam has some serious competition with Jonny Lee Miller's Knightley - I can hear women sighing all over the world.  The Elton's are hilariously overbearing - Christina Cole plays \\"snotty\\" so terribly well, as evidenced by her earlier performances as Blanche Ingram in \\"Jane Eyre\\", and as Miss Bingley in \\"Lost in Austen\\".<br /><br />Everything about this EMMA is light, fresh and utterly delightful.  It's like discovering the story all over again.  Just let go of your pre-conceptions and enjoy.  Recommended.ss has brought something unique to the part.  We need to remember that, in the book, Emma is barely out of her teens and as such probably wouldn't have had the sophistication or elan of a woman who was exposed to London society.  Unlike her older sister, Emma has spent her entire life at Highbury, and this would have significantly impacted her general day-to-day behaviour.  When the imperious Mrs Elton (Christina Cole) arrives on the scene, we can catch a glimpse of the clash between the \\"city\\" and \\"country\\" social attitudes, and the life Emma might have had if she indeed ventured on to London.<br /><br />I'm delighted to see Emma's sister and brother-in-law feature more prominently in the action here (in past versions they were always painted as passing, almost inconsequential characters).

B0071T5PN0|2.0|It may be just me, but this doesn't sound like a Van Halen album. It sounds like a David Lee Roth solo project and the invited line up this time around was Eddie, Alex and Wolfgang. Too bad as I really wanted to get excited about this album. Save your money and throw Eat 'em and Smile, Sky Scraper or A Little Ain't Enough onto the ipod if that's the sound you're looking for because that's the sound VH delivered this time around.
B005JABSB6|5.0|Since your brand purchase decision of a 3D TV basically 'locks' you into that brand's compatible 3D glasses (they're not interchangeable), I thought I'd tell you my experience between the Sharp and Samsung.<br /><br />Before purchasing a Sharp 60LE847U 3D TV, I purchased and had to return due to other performance issues a Samsung UN55D7000 series 3D TV. (Of the two, the Sharp TV is by far the superior 3D Smart TV, but I digress.)<br /><br />When comparing the Sharp AN3DG20B Active 3D glasses with the Samsung SSG3050GB Active 3D glasses, Sharp again wins hands down. While the Sharp glasses are roughly 3x the price of the Samsung, it's truly a case of 'you get what you pay for.'<br /><br />Style, fit, and comfort wise, the Sharp is by far the better of the two glasses. While I didn't measure the lens sizes of the two glasses, the Sharp's lens seem to be larger and its temples definitely wider, thus providing a better viewing experience. The Sharp's 3D angle viewing range is better/wider as well. The Sharp also comes with a nice detachable nose bridge pad that would probably be necessary for a child's small nose.<br /><br />The Samsung glasses are bluetooth and keeping them synced to the Samsung TV was spotty at best when sitting only about 10ft from the TV. The Sharp glasses, on the other hand, are infrared so there's no constant syncing/resyncing/re-resyncing involved. And I have had no issues with the Sharp glasses while viewing 10ft or more from the TV.<br /><br />The Sharp glasses are rechargeable and come with a USB charging cable, while the Samsung batteries are not rechargeable. The Sharp glasses also have a thoughtful 2D-option switch, which allows a person to view the 3D movie in 2D while others in the room can still watch the movie in 3D.<br /><br />Lastly, the active shuttering/flickering on the Samsung were more pronounced, so those users who are sensitive to the active 3D technology may find the Sharp active glasses more tolerable/pleasing to use.<br /><br />Like I've said, if you've already bought a 3D TV, then you're pretty much locked into having to use that brand's compatible 3D glasses, making my review non-useful to you. IF, however, you're still contemplating your 3D TV purchase decision and the quality of the 3D glasses are high on your TV purchase decision criteria, then I hope you find this review helpful. But at minimum, I at least hope my review helped to prevent your getting conjunctivitis from trying out the never-cleaned, oily-smudged 3-D glasses on display in the big-boxed stores!
B007MNV5WU|3.0|my wife's. free phone app has a third level. why not the pay version. game is fun but too short.
B0086700CM|5.0|nice yeah its nice hell yeah its nice yea it nice I love this game bruh is it ok if I call you bruh my bad I mean sir or mam or he she I don't judge
0345803507|5.0|I finished the trilogy in one week and then proceeded to read them again and again.  I've read the trilogy three times.  I cannot get enought of Christian and Anastasia!  You just don't want them to end.  A friend told me about Shades and I came home and pulled it up on Amazon.  I went right out to the book store and purchased the first one.  It pulled me in right away.  I ordered the second and third ones from Amazon, right then and there. I received them in 3 days.  Oh, my....I was hooked...what can I say?
B0086700CM|5.0|My friends were making fun of me for not having this app on my kindle while they had it on their iphones. well i finally have it its clearer better graphics too compared to iphone.
0345803485|5.0|It's awsome story with great writin details. You have to buy all three books, don't settle with just one book. Great book E L James.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is what I would say more addicting than angry birds. once you start playing its hard to get away from it. overall temple run is great and worthwhile.
0345803493|5.0|I absolutely love this book. That's on of the Fifty Shades Trilogy books. It's something new in a book that makes you want it more.
B0086700CM|5.0|I been waiting for this game to come on kindle fire. This is one of the best games the have on ur kindle as well ur phone!!!
0345803507|5.0|Love it all three books. I read all of them in one week. Make sure you'll get them all. I'm happy I bought them so I can read most favorite parts over and over again. I might read them all over again.
B006UIUJ2A|5.0|Few people in the world can write knowledgeably about life in North Korea (DPRK), and within that subset of humanity, how many could reasonably create a novel?  And not just any novel, but an intricately woven tale that incorporates the voice of an \\"enlightened\\" interrogator for the regime, as well as the perspective of an apparent orphan, or at least, a son of the master of an orphanage in North Korea. Oh, and add into this mix of characters a lonely, spoiled movie star of revolutionary films, a young girl working in a fish cannery dreaming of a better life in Pyongyang among the privileged elite, and cameo appearances by the Dear Leader, Kim Il-Jong, himself.<br /><br />This novel left me haunted by not only the utter brutality and nightmarish quality of life in North Korea, but also the bittersweet love story of the eponymous \\"Orphan Master's Son\\" - his search for meaning in a surreal world where nothing has any meaning other than the story that is assigned to you by the Dear Leader, which can change based on his whim.  While reading it I was struck with the parallels to Orwell's \\"!984\\", which this echoes in all of its melancholy and at times brutally disturbing depictions of life in prison camps, or just the sheer absurdity of life in a country where you can be randomly plucked from your commute to the office to work for a week in a \\"volunteers brigade\\" harvesting rice or filling sandbags to guard against floods.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone like me who has a fascination for this modern day Hermit Kingdom, secluded from the outside world.  Even those who don't have a basic understanding of life under the Kim's or what Juche is, can appreciate the amazing story that was created in this breathtaking novel.  A work of art and a sure classic.
B0080YGZ20|5.0|I listen to the album all the time: when I sleep to when I go jogging. Her voice puts me in a trance and my heart fills with love. I feel like Im a better person after experiencing the richness of her voice and the album. She is right up there to me w SIA...and waaay better than ADELE.
B0086700CM|5.0|The game game is additive and fun to play and you will love just as much I love it I will not let my sister even play
B007FH9GT2|1.0|I love to read.  I was just able to get thru the book of THE GIRL WITH THE DRAGON TATTOO.  It was too, too graphic for me.  We decided to watch the movie version to see how they interpreted the book.  Yep, just as graphic. SO, unless you REALLY liked the book, there are things that you can't un-read and un-see.  Too graphic, too disturbing for me.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is the best app ive had! my mom steals my kindle just 2 play the game and she will play it for hours if her schedule would let her!
B0071MV540|2.0|okay, so I gave this movie a chance because eddie murphy was in it. but it was overly influenced by ben stiller, so it ends up being a \\"classic\\" ben stiller-esque movie (not a compliment) that very much a different theme/ topic but same ben stiller non-funny push to make funny- squirm in your seat because you can't believe you let yourself watch another ben stiller movie.  Summary: no more ben stiller movies for me, regardless of who he managed to coax/ pay to co-star in the movie.
B0086700CM|5.0|the game was the best I ever played I couldn't put it down. I only got it yesterday and I love it already
B007PKOKTK|2.0|starts out good... gets lame... ends even lame-er.  Cute graphics would only be for small kids. Fail on what could have been a cute concept movie. The plot was blown to pieces as the movie progressed.  The resolution was an epic fail.  Perfect example of why I am not a movie person. PASS.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is the best game ever. I am so happy that I downloaded this app. You can never get enough of this game.  I &lt;3 THIS GAME!
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Hi, I can rate this movie as 3.5 of 5, the movie is very good but if they took care much more for the graphic I think the movie can reach 5 of 5. I will watch this movie again and again because it is interesting movie    source: [...]    Thanks
B007JM4CWY|5.0|This game has proven to be a great challenge. CrossMe is one of the best puzzle games I have ever played!
0345803485|1.0|Like many other reviewers I question if this was written by a teenager. The descriptions sound like something an 8th grader would have put together in a creative writing class. I assumed best seller would mean it's at least decent, but then I remembered Twilight was a best seller too. I'd probably rather read a 528 page Ikea assembly manual than this, and am embarrassed to say I wasted over an hour on it.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great story, erotic but storyline with mystery, suspense & romance - a touch of keeping true to yourself while giving of your body to heights of ecastcy
B005L38QK2|5.0|When I bought this mouse I was amazed at the detail and illumination.  However, the only thing wrong with the mouse is that it has a button right behind the scroll wheel that puts the mouse in sleep mode... If you press it too many times, it won't wake up.  There is an update for this on the SteelSeries website and the mouse has worked since!  Other than that button, the mouse rocks the world of Diablo 3 pretty epically.  :)  Thumbs up!
B007SYWFRM|2.0|I like this game. Its fun but every time I want to exit the game, I have to completly shut down my kindle fire. That gets old quick.
B00196W840|5.0|I was looking for a cheap copy of this book so that I could mark it up and write a term paper on it without messing up my good copy. What else can I say except that it's an excellent story and the book held up in spite of my violent underlining?
B001JI72AI|5.0|Apollo 13 was to be shown during the last days of school for my 7th graders' science class but a parent protested.  I could not remember anything inappropriate so I decided to buy it to see for myself as I recalled it as being awesome!  It was!  I can see how some parents may object to the innuendo and language.  There is a shower scene that is filmed at the end of an encounter so a little imagination is required but most 7th graders have seen worse on network tv in commercials!  And this is such a minor part of the movie in comparison to the AWESOME lessons on bravery, patriotism, ingenuity and perseverance.  AS I allowed my 7th graders (I have twins) to watch with me at home, the movie sparked excited discussions about \\"what if...\\" and \\"how...\\"; the innuendo was left in the dust.
068485743X|5.0|All good stuff in here, and I have to say anyone who enjoys Notes from the Underground by Dostoyevsky too certainly earns five stars from me :^)<br /><br />What's this book about?  It's help to grab the attention of an agent, editor or reader on the first page to get them to turn it to the second, then the third.<br /><br />And it's about getting the right attention, not like the student who scribbled `don't fale me' smiley-face on their test as a note to the teacher.
0345803493|5.0|I haven't read a book in a couple years and when my friend called me and told me about the Fifty Shades series I told her I wasn't sure if I would get into the books.  She was sure that I would enjoy the books and she was dead on.<br />I have 30 pages left on book number 3 and I am shocked that I am disappointed that I am almost done with the series.  I don't know if I will find another book better than these.  I have never read a book that I was this disappointed that they were over.  re: the sexual content in the books.  I think people are reading to far into that if you keep reading you will see the love story and the change for the better in Christian.  LOVE, LOVE, LOVE.  A must read.
0385344228|5.0|I had read the Strangler and when I read about Defending Jacob I put it on my list.  Soon several friends of mine began talking about it so I picked it up.  I am glad I did. It raises questions that all parents think about.  I read it with hope that all would be well at the end.  When I get involved with the characters it is a rewarding read.  I agree it lagged a bit in the middle but it was still memorable. The ultimate test to me is that when I finished it I thought about it for quite a while.
B0086700CM|4.0|Overall, I'm so happy this app finally came out for the Kindle. I've been waiting forever!!! My only complaint is that the touch isn't all that great. For example, when I am running to a turn and I swipe my finger to turn left, it doesn't work and I end up falling into the water. This game is worth getting!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|best game ever I love it its the best. if you haven't played it yet then you need to get this game
B000059H98|4.0|the product was what i asked for. it was sealed and works fine. the only problem i had was it took 2 weeks to get here and from where i understood it was coming from kentucky and im in indiana. hell even mail from florida or california only takes a week.
B0086700CM|5.0|I played this game almost everyday on a ipod and then I searched it up on my kindle it wasn't there<br />and now my brother tells me 9 months later they have temple run on the appstore so I get and enjoined. it
B0086700CM|4.0|great game loved it for the touch but when it glitches it messes u up ya Y a ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya ya
B0086700CM|5.0|Cant stop playing this game! but I don't understand how to resurrect after dying, will someone please explain this to me?
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|[[VIDEOID:mo83I2XY5DQY8Q]]
B0054JZC6E|4.0|in my opinion I think that the game is mediocre to good<br /> certainley not the best mini games I ever played but berg entertaining
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I was extremely disappointed in all 3 books but then again, I am the fool, spending $30.  The first one was decent but the story could hade been wrapped up in 1 book.<br />It was so repetitive and every other page was a sex scene that got boring after the first 20 times.<br />Anna was a ding ball that forgot to eat, check her cell phone...you know the man is going to call you and your out on the town and don't get the phone.  She was begging to cause friction.  She was no heroine.<br />And Christian, for a powerful self-made billionaire, he was jealous at every turn.  How do you get ahead in business with that kind of low self-esteem.<br />Anyway, I didn't enjoy the books at all, in fact, they depressed me....Uggg.
B0086700CM|5.0|I thought wwf and scrabble was my speed for gaming, thought I could never get addicted to one of those games.<br />By chance downloaded the game when I read the reviews,  I thought I was to old for those type games but<br />am pleased to say immediatley became addicted.  Great game
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This is a fun and quirky game that keeps your interest with building your ice-age city and adds humorous along with it. Love it.
B0086700CM|5.0|temple run is so Much fun it is easy to handle and amazing!!!!! I love the characters and the things at the shop! the coins are a nice touch too!
B0086700CM|4.0|I've only played the game a few days now and I keep coming back to it... I have no idea why I'm running or if I'm even changing levels as I go along..... but again, somehow, I'm really liking it... The comments the game makes every time I get killed never fail to crack me up.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I never think a second book is as good as the first.  The first book usually gives up all new info and by the time you read the second book the repetition is horrible, but this book definitely throws you a curve ball and keeps you guessing.  Keep reading!!
B0086700CM|5.0|I like how they are Runing away from the monkeys. FUNNY LIKE A BUNNY GUMMY. So fun I can never stop playing it OW
B0059XTTW8|1.0|Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy, 2011 film<br /><br />The story begins in darkness, then a door opens to let a man enter a very large room. A man will be sent to Hungary to meet a General who has the name of a double agent in Britain. There is a meeting, but it is a trap! Later there is a meeting in Britain. Then we see various locations and actions. A man walks to his home. The Treasury questions their budget items and their efficiency. We see other people at other scenes. \\"There's a mole in the Circus.\\" Smiley is retired now but will take the job. We see a scene from the past. \\"Operation Witchcraft.\\" Their leader is temperamental. Smiley will check the names of the recently retired. There is talk about trading access to secrets. [The talk seems pointless, as if something is missing.] Then we see an office party. There is a scene in a boy's school.<br /><br />Next we are in Budapest again. A woman offers a secret as trade for her defection: a double agent. But she is put on a ship and disappears! Can he get her out? We see how telephone conversations are monitored by a government agency. Peter looks for a ledger. We see him borrow a ledger. Percy questions him. Back at George's place he attacks Ricky Tarr! George talks about a meeting in 1955. A fanatic always has a secret doubt, says George. They have an unusual Santa Claus for their Christmas party. We see more about that incident in Hungary. [The film continues to drag on.] Scenes keep repeating, like padding. There is a confrontation on an airfield. \\"I am loyal!\\" They get an address. Next we see Paris. There is a meting, then they leave. George waits in the dark. Are these scenes confusing? A sniper shoots a man. [What about the body?] Then it ends.<br /><br />Maybe this would make sense if you read the book first. This story seems like a senseless jumble of scenes connected through the same actors. Was it done to disguise the original story? This is too serious to be a parody, and it isn't funny either.
1594203334|5.0|I decided to read this book after hearing about it on the Today Show. I am not a Francophile and I am in fact proud to be an American. I am however, a working mother of two daughters ages 3 and 1. I proudly have two little girls who sleep through the night, eat what I cook them (for the most part), and I can trust my 3 year old to listen to me and take no for answer (I'm working on the 1 year old obviously). Oddly enough they can entertain themselves (something I also thought was important). My 3 year old did a 100 piece jigsaw puzzle by herself they other day without me standing behind herself screaming \\"good job.\\" They didn't get this way by following Dr. Sears's method of attachment parenting either. I decided to be a little bit firmer with my girls after watching family members struggle with children that have not had any limits set with them. I also wanted kids who could play on their own and didn't need to be constantly entertained by a parent or television. Don't get me wrong my girls receive lots of hugs, kisses, treats and fun outings but they can't do whatever they want either.  My nephews are 3 and 5 and are still up all night long in their parents' beds!! So when Time Magazine came out with that piece on attachment parenting I started to wonder if I was damaging my kids by being too \\"strict.\\" I also carried so much guilt for working part time, having a great deal of trouble with breastfeeding (none of your business), and spending any time on myself for that matter. I even had a childless coworker imply I was selfish for training for a half marathon. I'm sure this is a generalization but learning that there was a whole country of women who do not share the guilt that most American mothers have, took a HUGE weight off my shoulders. I am not a perfect mother and I never sought out to be, but I am doing that best I can which so far has been good enough for my girls. They appear to be happy and healthy. I also don't want to move to France either, some of their methods seemed a little too much and I really do like a America. So sit down pour yourself a cup of coffee, let the kids entertain themselves for a bit (it won't kill them) and read Druckerman's book. It may also help you let go of some of that \\"mommy guilt.\\"
B0086700CM|5.0|This game is not only fun but skillful...but be aware you cannot just play on game...once u start its hard to put it down!!
B000305ZS4|5.0|I should probably start by saying I'm not a huge fan of most black metal. I can tolerate bands like Mayhem and Darkthrone in small doses, but soon find myself getting bored to bitter tears by the repetitive riffs, savage blast beats and cut rate production. But I know good music when I hear it...at least that's what I tell myself...and this album is a masterpiece. Emperor managed to mix that cold, raw, \\"true kvlt\\" black metal aesthetic with a majestic and sometimes downright beautiful layer of melancholy keyboard lines and choir affects, creating a grand and chaotic wall of sound that has yet to be matched (without being grossly overwrought, i.e. Dimmu Borgir, although I like them too for different reasons). Quite simply, this is what \\"symphonic black metal\\" SHOULD sound like. Epic, cold, haunting and evil, with a better handle on musicianship and melodicism than the \\"kvlt\\" camp. In a word: PERFECT. Some will grimace at the production value, but I think it adds to the overall experience and is nowhere near as baleful as other BM releases of the time. You can lower the volume to reveal little musical subtleties here and there, too. And as a bonus, the re-released version contains two \\"Anthems\\"-era cover songs. An ASTONISHING take on Bathory's \\"A Fine Day to Die\\", and a ripping rendition of Mercyful Fate's \\"Gypsy\\". Great stuff. Hail EMPEROR! Oh, and having what is perhaps the best cover artwork EVER ties it all together quite nicely...
B003ZJ0ZX0|5.0|This was my first Bruno Mars Cd that i purchased. After hearing some of the songs on the radio, i decided i wanted to hear these songs all the time. I am very happy with the song selection. My favorites are, \\"I think i want To Marry You\\", great song that makes you happy and gets you moving. My other would be\\"Talking To The Moon\\", a little sad, but for me it brings back a memory of a lost love a long time ago, who I still miss very much.
B0086700CM|4.0|well im happy that they got this app for kindle fire but...<br />it kinda goes too fast for me and it pauses in the middle for like 3 seconds and than goes on its basicly not good
B005IZLPMY|5.0|i thought this movies was awesome when i seen it in the theater,but still good at home only with surround sound.good casting on blu ray a plus with a fair price.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game it is so fun!! and the best part is its free!!!! :D<br />You need to buy it!! well not really cuz its free!!!!
B0043GAZYS|5.0|story line great,the effects awesome,casting cant beat it.and a movie made like that what gamers or any body my age not from the ghetto remember having a nintendo/atari sounds bring back good memories.instant cult comedy classic right next to the big lewbowski!
B007P3TMW2|5.0|My husband and I kind of rented this movie on a whim not really expecting much from it.  Boy were we wrong!  This is one of the best movies I have ever seen!  So well done from the acting to the storyline.  So glad we watched it!

B0086700CM|4.0|I think temple run on the kendle is really fun! it sometimes has weird pause things but it is really fun. I could play is sometimes but doesn't do as good as ipods
B004JMSIRC|4.0|a gave it a four due to the same ole movie with a lil updating.good cast good movie fair price.but the second is much better tho.check it out.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|although the games are simple they are fun,  interesting and do involve some critical thinking. It is a great way to pass the time when other games become boring or tiresome.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|this movie surprised me really,but the second one way better than the first.both good movies for the want to be detectives out there.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a game to play when you need a break from work. It is easy to play (one suit) and gets more difficult as you add. My wife loves it too.
B003YHSE7W|4.0|probably the first movie i saw the second iron man is better then the first,how the f does that happen.they need better people to direct all mavel movies.some times i do feel what the reviewer said about it feels like batman foreverbut with all mavels movies except thor!lucky im giving it a four only because its in blu ray!
B003Y5H574|5.0|This is a great family drama/comedy story with some nice twists and a lot of honesty.  I loved this movie and then wasn't surprised it was written by Dan Fogelman, who wrote the romantic TANGLED. Not surprisingly, I both own these movies.  Here's a rare screenwriter.... man who writes a story as strong as the great William Goldman. highly recommended.
B000Q6GX5Y|5.0|a truely mans movie that makes the panties of your girlfriend wet.a classic but some true battles that no man has every seen or image before and never had feat like that.awesome movie with a good cast.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Catching Fire is the third installmnet in the Hunger Games trilogy, so I will review the trilogy as a whole with specifics about Catching Fire.<br />The Hunger Games trilogy is an excellent series. I found the premise of the story compelling and engaging. I like the development of the characters and felt the story-telling to be high quality.<br />Catching Fire is the darkest of the three books, and understandably so; the arthur wanted to show how war both physically and emotionally affects those who are caught in its grasp.<br /> I will say where the first two books I had trouble putting them down, that was not necessarily the case with Catching Fire. Nevertheless it is a good story and deserving to be read.
B0086700CM|5.0|this is 2 addicting.  I was so happy when I saw I could get it on my kindle fire!!!!  I deffently recommend!!!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this book. After hearing lots of hub-bub about it I decided to read it myself found that, under all of it, there was a bit of a tragic romance going on. It surely kept my interest.

B001V7UXG2|3.0|...the New York stuff just seems to repeat itself over and over. Fry and Laurie are very very good, has to be said. gets 3 from me because I love Woodhouse and this is a great adaptation but probably a few series too far.
0307888908|2.0|There are certainly bits of this book that are helpful. I'm not denying that. The content itself is fairly good. But the incessant referrals to LinkedIn leave a sour taste in my mouth. The entire book feels like more of a self-satisfying advertisement than anything else.
B003EV6DBM|1.0|The thing with River Song had just been going on too long and at the end it was ***p. Moffat has just made it boring. Matt looks stupid  - a bit like Prince William in that pretend military Gilbert and Sullivan style outfit he wore at his wedding.
B0058YPL66|5.0|This is one of my favorite shows.<br /><br />It is fun, interesting, mind boggoling, and adventures for the grown up child.<br />I love how we get to go beyond the story we heard - behind the scenes - like we did with Wicked.<br /><br />It is so nice to be able to to enjoy TV again.<br /><br />I'm purchasing the set to give to my mom who will also enjoy the continuation to the stories we shared.
B007H9B8FS|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />In the mid-90's, Garbage emerged onto the music scene and created a new sound with their first two records. They took the angst of grunge rock, the dark, inventive beats of trip-hop, and added catchy pop choruses, all delivered by a charismatic frontwoman. After their first two albums, they began to experiment a little more with \\"Beautiful Garbage\\", adding elements of hip-hop and even 60's Girl Groups (long before Amy Winehouse, Adele, etc. began reviving the sound I might add) into the mix. And with \\"Bleed Like Me\\" the band offered a more conventional rock record.<br /><br />Seven years later, Garbage has finally returned with a new album and surprise ... it basically sounds like it's the 1990's all over again. This is really not such a bad thing, because vintage Garbage was great. You've got the dark, sexy sonic atmospheres. The tracks so overproduced that they actually come across as raw. And of course, Garbage's Ace in the Hole, Shirley Manson. Shirley's always been a fascinating presence, always playing the role of the eternal, tormented adolescent; sexy, angry, mercurial, disgusted by phoniness and hypocrisy, and both thrilled and confused by romantic love. (I've seen Garbage live, and Shirley is also an energetic and thrilling performer.)<br /><br />Unfortunately, I don't think most of the songs on NYKOP are as compelling as Garbage's classics. It's nice to hear the band back together and back making new material. I'm hoping they don't wait too long to make another album, and I'm hoping the next one blows me away with something completely fresh and unexpected.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I have just completed the third book in the trilogy, and about all I can say pertaining to this book is that Fifty Shades Freed has a relatively \\"happy\\" ending.  However, the Epilogue (i.e., \\"Christian's First Christmas\\" and \\"Meet Fifty Shades\\") leaves the reader wondering if, in fact, Christian will EVER be freed. I didn't see the reasoning behind the author's including these two sections.  In each of these sections, the reader sees things from a totally different perspective (through Christian's eyes.)  I am not going to go so far as to say it was one of my favorite reads; however, as this book further unfolds the story of Christian and Anastasia, there are some redeeming qualities.  I still regret having spent the time and money on this book.  It just wasn't worth it...especially for a reader who is not into blatantly kinky sex (and I mean KINKY) and psychologically screwed up males.  Come to think of it, Ana had to have some loose screws for putting up with Christian and his totally-controlling behaviors.  The most positive thing I can say is that I have read the Fifty Shades books. This book, like the other two, is lacking a truly talented author and a competent editor.  Just not my cup of tea.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved The Hunger Games Trilogy! I can't wait for the rest of the movies to come out!! Definitely a must read!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Due to the hoopla surrounding these Fifty-Shades books, and due to the fact that I am an avid reader, I felt that I should read this book because of its high rating as Amazon's top seller.  The book is very poorly written/edited, and I found the the in-your-face kinky sex to be monotonous.  There was very little that would give me reason to recommend the book.  I was 80% through the book before I became interested in the characters and how they were evolving.  If I had it to do over, and if I had known what I know now, I never would have purchased this book for my Kindle.  At least, when other women ask me if I've read Fifty Shades of Grey, I can reply \\"yes.\\"  It's a pity this author is cashing in on this novel. Wish I'd spent my $9.99 more wisely!
B0086700CM|5.0|I am sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo glad that they finnally put this out for kindle fire! it is the most addicting game ever and I snapped it up as soon as it came out and I cant stay off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! love this game
B007IXWKUK|2.0|Well, about the only positive thing I can say about this author is she knows how to leave the reader hanging so he/she will purchase the second book in this trilogy. I fell for this, much to my sorrow.  If the reader can push the kinky sex aside, there is the beginning of a story in this second book.  Sadly, I think I wasted another $9.99.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book may be the last in the trilogy but the suspense in this book is about three or even four times greater than the first two. The turn of events are unexpected but the intensity of Christian and Ana's love story remains in tact. I find both characters more mature and the battles that they fight in this story lead them to discover more about each other in a way that can be described as both romantic and brutal - at least for me.
B0086213XW|4.0|This film wasn't like most that end all pretty and perfect. I don't agree with the reviewer that writes that the dialog seems forced; I think that we are so used to the better than average conversations that happen in most television and movie productions, that we forget what it's like to see/hear a more realistic representation of what an average everyday woman might go through if she is put in that situation.  I enjoyed the film for what it was.
B0052VUNHC|5.0|This book is beautiful but is certainly not a disaster. Full of sexual encounters and strong adult language, this novel is steaming hot! The \\"bet\\" plot may be simple and traditional but Jamie makes up for the lack of story by vivid descriptions of the characters and the events that take place between Abby and Travis. I actually find this book erotic!
0061992860|4.0|Love the product. It did take a month and a half to get to me though. I forgot I even bought it it took so long. All the info I expected and then some. Perfect size (very small, or compact). All in all I'm happy. I didn't need it right away anyway.
0439023513|3.0|Mockingjay was OK.  Having truly enjoyed The Hunger Games, I looked forward to the second and third books.  What was dragged on and on in second and third books could have easily been summed up early on.  I enjoyed parts of Mockingjay but there were plenty of parts that I could have gone without having read.  Honestly, I read this third installment of The Hunger Games just to find out how it all ended and at least I really did enjoy the ending.  What I thought I predicted the ending to be - was not.  Perhaps my expectations were too high after having read The Hunger Games, which is an excellent book.
B0086700CM|4.0|so siked that they finally got this on my kindle(: I would've given it 5 stars but the game lags sometimes. if this would be changed it would be amazing!!
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Real Steel was one of my favorite movies of 2011! Truly a film with lots of heart as well as action. Must see!!!!
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|It's fun while you're playing it, but it always crashes and it's ridiculous. I've already installed and uninstalled this app multiple times and it's still no use. That's my only peeve :P But hopefully they'll get it fixed!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|All I must say is Epic!!!!!!!!!! This movie has such intense action & drama. Marvel has made one of the best movies of all time!!!
1878424319|1.0|Sometimes it only takes a few sentences to know that you DON'T want to take advice from someone.  In this book, one of the four agreements is \\"Don't take anything personally.\\"  This is good advice when you're trying not to let someone get you down, but the author says, \\"If they tell you how wonderful you are, they are not saying that because of you.\\" (p. 53) So don't let that encouragement or much-appreciated compliment go to your head! But, you know, there are just some things that, no matter how hard I try, I'm going to take personally.  The author says (again on p. 53) , \\"Even if someone got a gun and shot you in the head, it was nothing personal.\\"  Wow!  If you can't take murder personally then there really is no excuse to EVER be upset!  I think this author is TRYING to make some good points, but he has the worst examples to back up those ideas.  Of course, I know the author won't take my opinion personally if he reads it - but maybe he should. Try a much better book such as Dale Carnegie's \\"How to Stop Worrying and Start Living.\\"
B0086700CM|5.0|I have this game on all my devices and I love it! Plus you can adjust the sensetivity what other game lets you do that! Ugh, Im in love!
B0086700CM|5.0|this is an amazing game I recommend it to any one and every one who likes a good challenge and killer monkeys.
B005USZYDU|1.0|This book is incomplete... Have complained to Amazon, but nothing has been done as of today...<br />shame that you sell an incomplete product....<br />shame, shame, shame!!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|So happy to finally have Temple Run! I love this game! My husband enjoys this game as well. It helps me keep up with my fast reflexes. :)  My 3 year old loves to try to play it;  she things the monkeys are scary but she does pretty well.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a very fun game to play. it is like supervise Mario.I play this game all the time and I never get tired of playing. if you yet this game you will never be bored.
B0086700CM|5.0|its a really addicting game with sharp turns and sudden jumps. Stay away from the demon monkeys! !But you can purchase coins using real money but you don't really need to buy them seeing as you run you collect the coins themselves.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games, by Susan Collins, opened up by helping set up the concept of the games so that the reader has an understanding of how everything is going to be played out.  The games started after the biggest war in history and each year, one male and one female between the ages of twelve and eighteen are randomly chosen to participate in the games.  The Hunger Games is a fight to the death battle in which only one participant is allowed to win.  The games are a way of showing that the Capital controls the people and that by having \\"sacrifices\\", it's their way of showing to appreciate what your given.  I would recommend this book because its full of action and it keeps the reader wanting to know what's going to happen next with ever situation that comes up.  There isn't a boring moment in the book. The grammar used in the book was very clear so that the reader could easily understand what the author is telling them without losing sight of the storyline.  The word choice used was very good.  Words were used that weren't your everyday use of words, but ones that the reader could still understand the story without it being boring.  The voice that is used throughout the book is a unique one in which the author is able to captivate the reader in a world that doesn't exist, but it almost feels as though it truly does.  This was a very good book and I would strongly recommend others to read it as well.
B005DOKIYG|5.0|Excellent sleeve for my kindle Fire. Interior padding is sufficient to protect the Kindle, The price and quality of the product was good. The sleeve did no give off an odor as some other people had commented.
B001AQMBL4|5.0|The movie came very fast and in the condition it said. This was a gift for my son and he said it was perfect. Was very easy to find and order what he wanted since I'm not use to ordering Blu-rays that helped me out alot.[[ASIN:B001AQMBL4 Old School (Unrated and Out of Control!) [Blu-ray]]]

B00003CXA2|2.0|i love this movie & was looking very forward to watching it & when i got it in the mail it was a Blu-Ray disc which is NOT what is advertised. Instead of the Two-Disc it Showed , i was sent The Movie & the soundtrack which im not too excited about. If i could i'd go back & order the ONE DISC . It didn't even come with as case. Regardless Forrest Gump is a movie i fell in love with & its recommended by me to be watched.
