B004J4WLPU|5.0|I chose this rating as it was a fantastic suspense novel. Couldn't wait to get to the end! What a surprise ending!
B0083SBJXS|5.0|Love this movie.  It has a lot of great stars/HEROS.  Funny, and great storyline.  We have watched it three times already.
1452101248|5.0|This cook book is great quality!  Beautiful pictures and great recipes.  Its a great gift for someone who loves to cook
B009PEKRY6|3.0|Fun CD and I know my daughter can listen to it. Bonus. Up beat and fun to jam out to.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|I'm not even finished with it and I'm already in love with it.  Anne Frank is an amazing writer.  Although the story is about very dark times, Anne finds a way to bring humor to a tale of such an awful time period.  After I finish this one, I think I may even purchase the The Diary of Anne Frank: The Critical Edition.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|I love this game. The social stuff is fun and the graphics are nice, but the pop ups are a little annoying. I can usually ignore them, but every time always seems like a close call. Like  they're trying to get me to &quot;accidentally&quot; spend my money. Again, I love the game, but be careful when you start up the game.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|The Team of Rivals is a comprehensive analysis of Abraham Lincoln's choice of cabinet members and of the unique ability of Lincoln to envision the difficulties he would face in fighting the Civil War and in getting support to gain passage of the thirteenth amendment to the Constitution which would forever ban slavery  in the United States.
B000002KBD|5.0|I was looking for an old Van Morrison tape.  Very satisfied with the CD.  Received very quickly, great condition, would recommend.
B000VDDDVO|4.0|Always wanted this movie.  Brings back memories of days ago.  One of those movies I will watch all year long.
B008133MDK|5.0|I love this series and all things Sherlock Holmes. What an amazing interpretation of the role and of Dr Watson.
B009JBZH54|4.0|Product arrived moderately fast. Only complaint is it arrived in a box that you could easily unfold and had no kind of sealing material (tape or anything) so somebody could've easily popped the box open and taken it, handled slightly rough from the way the discs weren't secure, but great movie, great price just needed more secure packing.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I thought the trilogy was really good the first book was my least favorite and each book got exponentially better. Great series can't wait for the movies
B007HACDLK|5.0|We need some &#34;Mitch Rapp&#34; types on the payroll. Vince Flynn writes the Rapp books with a passion that makes the reader want to keep reading more of his books.
B002BWP49C|4.0|Because I read all of the books a few years back, I truly didn't know what to expect. Even when the first movie was released, I intentionally didn't go to see it. Now it's 2012 and I finally decided to watch the movies to determine whether they truly represented the books. I liked Part I of Breaking Dawn. I can't say that my expectations were high, but after watching it, I definitely wanted to see Breaking Dawn--Part II.<br />If you are a fan, you won't be disappointed. If you are a skeptic, like myself, you will be pleasantly surprised.
B004KKXMSI|5.0|It was repeated excitement, ..incomparable, amazing awesome and memorable. I even dreamt this movie in 3D and it looked like I am there..wow
B0069SG4W0|4.0|I bought this vinyl thing by accident. Glad they issued it on CD, too! Can't stand vinyl ticks and pops, but love alt. versions!!<br />Funny, I think in Goldmine (Record Collecting) magazine, when CDs were debuting, and they mentioned a new noise reduction system for analog tape recordings, and there was a MAJOR sonic improvement with Doors songs! But, in reality, it had nothing to do with noise reduction, the session tapes where found/used - remixed/remastered/whatever. I feel their original vinyl albums sounded poor in quality (poorly mastered). The udders needed more milking, so up pops alternate versions - proof they had the session tapes for a LONG time!
B002JVWR4A|5.0|I hadn't watched the show from the start so I needed ot catch up with the characters.  The price made it very affordable.
B001U2FASE|5.0|Already knew that I liked the movie but this was definitely worth buying. The quality was as good as it gets.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|I loved this book and agreed with the vast majority of its insights.  (I'm an introvert myself.)  Susan spent a lot of time researching and approaches personality from several different angles.  Well worth the read, regardless of where you are on the spectrum.  If you have someone opposite you in your life, it can help you connect.
0345803485|3.0|I really wanted to read and like this book. It just couldn't be done. It felt like a story I've read before. I wasn't a fan of the writing, either. To me, it seemed like it had a lot of potential, but didn't add up. I think I might try the second book to see if the series gets any better. I'm just on the fence about this one.
B004LROUNG|5.0|I've read most of Grisham's books and, as usual, The Litigators is a suburb read!!  Well recommended! I always think of Grisham's work as a movie, Matt Damon in the lead!!!
B00881PPTO|4.0|This is just an ad free version which is nice but a bit odd for a commercial app in the first place.
B0050R0XPA|5.0|This is what Lego is all about! It's a fun build, interesting enough tor older builders, and challenging for the younger crowd. It comes with great accessories and is a fantastic addition to Lego's growing Winter Village collection. It was a huge hit with our family.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|So many animated movies are variations of the same story line of emotional manipulation: oh, no! where's my mommy?! scream! there's a shark! scream! we're sliding down a glacier/steep hillside/whatever! heh, heh--the parrot farted... I just can't stay awake when I agree to watch these things with a daughter. But this one, finally, has a delightful story, well developed characters, clever dialogue... and many, many minutes without screaming chase scenes or lame fart jokes. Good stuff.
0060574216|5.0|We read it out loud to eachother and then discuss the points and how we feel about it.  Our relationship is stronger.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I read this book and loved it!!!! Can't wait for the second on that is written from the male character's point of view.  Loved how EL James put that last chapter in Fifty Shades Freed and this author is writing this story from the males point of view!!! Love the story and will for sure read the next one.
1416511946|5.0|I love Nikki Sixx... Reading his story was totally wild.  I remmeber listening to Montley Crue when I was a teenager and reading it now it brings back those days :)
B0088XXCZ6|4.0|Fiona Apple is an amazing artist with so much talent. The songs are very different from Extraordinary Machine, but that's fine because they're just as great!
0060989157|5.0|Motley Crue rocked me in the 80's and I love reading the stories from all the band members.  Those were crazy days.
B00973902K|4.0|You know those songs you hear that just seem to follow you? They play it at weddings and in the library. It's played in the dining hall and it's your roommate's girlfriend's ringtone.<br /><br />and you hate it. You want to scratch your ears out. But then you start to sing along with it, catch yourself and scowl. Then, you secretly buy it and listen to it when no one's in the room and memorize the lyrics, singing it in the shower loudly, and getting caught by your dog who stares at you with condescending eyes?<br /><br />yeah. That's where I am with this song.
B007SGM084|5.0|It starts a little slow but as you read on the Trilogy gets going and very interesting. I am glad I chose to read all three books.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Today in the lives of some people, there is a famine of integrity of character.  A famine of compassion, of sensitivity, of treating another person as you would like to be treated.  In this book, these rich qualities are demonstrated in the life of a man, who, although unjustly persecuted, did not succumb to bitterness or revenge.  This is a book that is timeless in its message.  One you will enjoy.
B0058VW36U|5.0|My kids really love this game and it is quite a challenge. Makes you think. The graphics are cute and my daughter really loves that you can choose between a candy, donut or cupcake for the treat at the end of the rope. Lots of levels. Lots of fun.
B005WUHAX8|1.0|I have ordered 3 lifeproof cases from this seller and others and they are all counterfeit.  The buttons do not work. The case is made from a different material that is extremely stiff and does not allow the buttons to work.  The mute button wont even budge.  The clear plastic cover has little bumps or dots on it.  I would recommend going through lifeproof.com until this is all fixed and sorted by amazon.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Classic Angry Birds game. Lots of fun, plays great on the Kindle Fire HD and is quite a challenge. Lots of levels. Husband and kids really love this game.
B007MDB71O|5.0|I wanted to watch it again the moment it ended on the big screen. Fantastic!!! About this Blu-ray / DVD I only miss the trailer featuring \\"My body is a cage\\" theme by Peter Gabriel.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|This game is so unique and looks like it could be a lot of fun if only it would allow me to draw and play the game with my kindle fire hd in the upright position. It immediately flips upside down no matter which way I turn my Kindle. Very frustrating. I've deleted it and downloaded it a couple of times and it's the same thing every time...so I'm forced to play it with my Kindle flat on a table top. Otherwise, it looks like a very fun game.
B009DT9ANW|5.0|Awesome concert footage.  After all these years Frampton still has it.  Great guitar skills and his voice has held up to!  The guy has to be in his 60's and he is still rockin!
B000K7MMPE|1.0|Horrible, horrible adaptation of Pride and Prejudice.  Elizabeth was portrayed as dull and completely one dimensional.  She merely recited her lines.  Didn't they read the book before embarking on this fiasco?  She is supposed to be clever, witty, and loving all at the same time.  Mr. and Mrs. Bennet are completely unlikable.  As for Mr. Darcy, well a wooden puppet would have done just as well.  There was no feeling or emotion, and forget about chemistry between Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy.  The way they portrayed their characters made impossible to believe that they would ever be attracted to each other.  The scene of Elizabeth dancing with Mr. Darcy was just an exercise in script reciting.  I couldn't get past the second episode.  Any other version I have seen is much better than this one.
B001NSAJ3G|5.0|I hadn't listened to this album in 30+ years, now I remember why I loved it! I could still recite every word to every selection.. It's a keeper.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|watched the video through my pc. the definition was terrible and after about 20 minutes the video stopped. I waited for over an hour before the video restarted. won't be using amazon again.
B002W0KCB8|5.0|I've been a Paul McCartney fan since the Beatles first appeared on the Ed Sullivan show. Every track on this album just makes me smile, happy memories, fun songs. I love it, love it, love it
B001QOOCTE|5.0|loved this music, and the dvd made it better. what a great idea. hope to see more in the near future
1455527475|5.0|More than anything else, this book was an eye opener for me - to learn about the intricacies of trading, sitting in the front row of a derivatives salesman @ GS! I always wondered how to valuate a company... It ought to be as simple as: evaluating the fundamentals of a company, their balance sheet, the industry they are in etc... However, in this day and age, the \\"experts\\" on CNBC (or other media) seem to have more of a say on the intrinsic value of a stock.. (who incidentally may be betting against their own advice :))<br /><br />Greg points out that GS derivative trading acts in much the same way - advising clients of one thing and then betting against them... they make money both going in and out (commission on trades and profits on their bets)... It would not have been tragic, except that they folks doing the trading may be your and my 401K fund managers...<br /><br />Greg brings to life what you seldom here in the financial world - how the heck does it work? :). It makes you pause and ask questions like - \\"how come Wall Street honchos, banks are making so much money\\"? Doesn't it sound odd to you that a firm such as GS - which is nothing but some sort of a match maker- is making tons of money, whereas other known match makers - like Match.com and ebay.com - are not in the same league? Is moving $$ more valuable than moving good or getting people together?<br /><br />This book is a good wake up call... to evaluate how the financial system is wired... because if we do not take time to understand it - it will take us down for good this time.. unlike in the 2007 where it just \\"spluttered\\".<br /><br />Oh, by the way, till I understand better, I am planning to stick with my Index funds :)<br /><br />Would highly recommend reading this book.
B003TJ4YUQ|5.0|I had heard 1 cut from this CD and had to have it. it is the best idea anyone has had for sharing music. hope they do another
B002R22PB6|5.0|The first time I saw this movie, I was completely blown away. It is one of the most affecting pieces of cinema I have ever watched. The acting is brilliant, and the story touches you deeply. Even if you don't understand Spanish, everyone should watch this movie at least once. 5 stars.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I can't wait for the third book. The story of kvothe continues and is original, clever, and very entertaining. I love how the characters have personality, how some plots are predictable while others are surprising. This book really draws you into a different world and into the life of the main character. It is currently by far my favorite fantasy book.
0345529057|5.0|I bought this set while I was out of the country. It would have been really expensive to ship it to my local address, so I sent it to my home address since I would be home in a few weeks. I watched the first season of the show and ordered it immediately. By now it's kind of dated since the fifth one is not included, but it's still good to have.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|this little calculator does pretty much everything an average person needs<br />its easy to use and large enough to see well. thanks
B009JZWO3I|5.0|We don't watch TV very often so nice to buy this by the season and watch on my IPad.  The Good Wife is an excellent show: good plots, well written dialogue and great acting. A nice change from some of the stupidy out there.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the Lorax. I thought the art style was very true to Dr. Seuss and I loved the direction that the producers went with the movie. I don't know if it is true to the book exactly as I have not read the book, but I'm sure that people who loved the book will love the movie.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this is a great game and I will play this for ever. it takes me no time at all to level up. just fantastic.!
B005S9EJ46|5.0|Great cast, great story, great direction.  Who knew?  A movie without foul language and endless &#34;action&#34; scenes that delights and entertains.  And I loved all those real faces - no botox, no lifts.  Marvelous!
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Grisham has always written plot-driven books.  This story wanders all over the place, is convoluted, and honestly makes no sense.  I scanned the last third of the book as it became more and more -preposterous.
B00006FDCD|5.0|I love this movie! If you were ever stuck on the outside looking in, you'll feel as drawn to it as I do. Losers become winners when they fight the evil creature that has the town in thrall.
B004XWMXW4|5.0|Well, this is certainly a new way to hear these songs. The Cello gives us a new way to hear these great songs. Original and very talented guys give a wild, awesome new way to enjoy these songs we all know.
B00062PN6I|5.0|I was not so sure because of the price, but as soon as I got them I plugged them on my iphone and wow, nice sound, I like the way they wrap around your ear too. I am happy for what I needed for, I am just a normal person not a musician or anything like that, so just remember what are they for...
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Some movies only last after the 1st movie. Sequels don't always deliver, but Indiana Jones is a part of our culture like Star Wars. From the great minds of Lucas and Spielberg, comes our favourite traveler and adventurer. Each one delivers a fun time and a great chance to see the world looking for treasure and history. With many extras and a whole lot of in depth behind the scenes and hours of excitement. Despite many who didn't like Crystal Skull, its still a great fun time. Harrison Ford is still the great traveler and great personality.
B007C4E1R0|5.0|I saw the movie girl with the dragon tattoo hope there will be another I have read all three book
B008RTE066|5.0|Well, for one of the oddest and wild movies ever made, from one of the greatest bands ever, we get a  full treatment of this wacky, fun movie, on Blu Ray and DVD, with some great extras, book and LP's (Deluxe Edition only) Always been a hard to find movie on any format, we finally can see it in all its glory. Also we do have some great music. One of my faves.
0399157565|5.0|I have read two other books by Patricia and will read more enjoyed everyone. Can't wait for the next one
B008IZYWXU|5.0|Here we have a wonderful, musical album from one of our times all time great singers and performer. Freddie Mercury, of Queen fame, has given a wonderful, powerful and emotional performance with one of the greatest female opera singers of our time too. Barcelona is a great and powerful song as is the album. Finally a full remaster of a fantastic collaboration. Many bonus discs and extras, video and a remaster done with a full orchestra. For me, his best performance ever. As for my personal reasons, having actually lived in Barcelona as a kid, and seeing the LIVE performance in Barcelona, it just so impressive and meaningful. If you love Freddie and just inspirational music, its a great album to have.
B009O2XY12|1.0|would not save stars.  I had to play level 1 everytime, then after playing level 2 the stars for level 1 disappeared.  it never would acknowledge the stars.  after level 6 on level 7 it never progressed unless I pressed the back key.  after completing level 12 would not move on to 13.  fun, but hated the fact it wouldn't save stars and constantly asked for money.  booo.
B005S9EJ46|5.0|As far as independent movies goes, many are great and just well acted. This one is no exception. I loved this movie, and its simplicity and its wackiness as well as its emotional aspects. Just a great great cast of exceptional actors. Just a wonderful movie overall. A must see. Well filmed, great visuals, and great scenery and characters.
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I am not one to pay for radio (airwaves) when I can get them free, however this application is SWEET! Great features like the shake feature - when you shake your tablet and the App will automatically search for similar stations! Don't like the song? Just shake! LOVE IT!
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Well a classic album from the biggest singer in history. This new reissue is fully restored and features a bunch of extras. Several booklets and DVD, Live CD and a disc of extra tracks. The Live cuts are great, and the bonus tracks are interesting and show us how some songs evolved.  If you are a fan this edition is great, has some of MJJ's best songs.
B005NKIQ26|4.0|The only thing that was bad is that the cover of the cd was cracked. But the cd worked great.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|This movie was made for 3-D. It doesn't call attention to itself. You just feel like you're in the movie. For a long time Avatar was only available as a promo with Panasonic 3-D glasses--we have a Samsung TV--or for outrageous prices on eBay. I'm glad it's generally available now.
B007BVMVDU|4.0|Great show. We need more white walkers though! The family drama got a little tiring but the other stuff made up for it.
1932100660|5.0|This book has clued me in and given me a tremendous revelation into the food we eat.  I feel like the FDA needs to completely overhaul what they approve as edible.  I have changed my diet because of this book and now look for information pertaining to how to heal, protect and restore our bodies through a vegetarian based diet.  It literally is sickening to learn what actually has been passed off as food in the last 50 years. Yuck!
B009NPA3MS|5.0|I,m in love with this guy and his music.  I,m 54 years old and music is my great love in life beside my husband and Phillip just gave me a great collection of his work to keep me happy until his next album.  Great work.
B003E74B24|5.0|Very simple and a quick read. I have developed a deep respect for this man, and his book is not self glorifying in anyway.
B009LRE040|4.0|its the best batman movie made. bruce wayne seem the most believeable. made me think he knew he had one last fight left as batman. then to hang up his cape
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Love the movie, music, and the thought inspiration.  True that the bloodlines really do matter in breeding quality.  Not just horses but other mamals as well.
0156012197|5.0|I can't find this book in more retail book stores and i think everyone should read this book. It has great life leasons in it. The book arrived early and in perfect condition
B005NJU8PA|5.0|It is much more than a cook book.  I have bookmarked many, many links for so much more than I anticipated.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|If you need the basics right in your hand (or face) than this is the ebook to pick up before buying any other ebook which cost money. This will give you some analysis if your looking into buying an ebook but don't really know how to approach the task.
B000QFQE4U|4.0|If this Spike Lee joint, which plays as a neutral biography for three hours before suddenly transitioning into a propaganda piece, really does present an accurate portrayal of Malcolm X, I don't think his legacy deserves celebration. His underlying mission, to lift the social oppression of the black race, was a commendable one, yes. Racism, primarily by whites toward blacks, which remains an issue today, was even more of a problem during his lifetime; the end of which happened to coincide with the end of the Civil Rights Movement. But he too was a hardcore racist; a brainwashed follower of \\"The Honorable\\" Elijah Muhammad, The Nation Of Islam and all their ridiculous anti-white philosophies; for a long time.<br /><br />The fact that Malcolm X may have began to shed his bias during his final chapters; it wasn't until he made his \\"required\\" pilgrimage to Mecca that he realized not all white people are \\"devils\\"; isn't good enough. Accurate or not, Spike Lee has done a remarkable job of visually depicting the life of a man I may not have otherwise cared enough to learn about, but the man we're supposed to be praising comes across as not much more than a buffoon. As educated as he is when it comes to the English language; he studied every word in the \\"white man's\\" dictionary; he doesn't seem to be much of a thinker in the way of general logic, the kind of logic Martin Luther King had that says you can't end racism with racism.<br /><br />marcellee.com
0920668372|5.0|My mom gave me this book and i gave it to my daughter. It has a special meaning. That touched my mom, myself and now that my daughter is due with her first child.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|I really love how versatile this app is and the ease of use. The different mediums and vast array of colors make this very attractive for both my husband and me and our baby. I like that he can get an early start on creative expression with out the mess or trying to eat the paper/pen/paint etc etc. It also nice that you can save each item and send them.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|The fact that John Grisham can write books for youngsters/oldsters with a light touch and thrillers with such depth speaks volumes about his abilities.
B004DARF6A|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed this, the comedy is genius. Really timeless work for fans of Chaplin and those new to his films.
B002UZ5CHO|5.0|informative must see documentary of the food industry.  Takes the veil off the pastoral image government in cahoots<br />with corporate greed hides behind.
B0049VZ222|5.0|I have learned how to survive a zombie attack; looking forward to watching Season 2!  Kind of graphic but hey, survival of the fittest!
0307390349|5.0|Somehow, I'd never gotten around to reading Ms.Munro until getting this volume; only now do I realize what I've been missing all these years. What a wonderful storyteller! And the way she effortlessly weaves between past and present, memory and today is unlike anyone or anything I've come across before. I am now a camp follower and I'll be sure to read and enjoy her work for years to come, hopefully.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|Amazing book! I loved it. To me even better than Maze Runner, and that book was excellent. I recommend this series to every young reader.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a very good stratagy game I recommend it if you like adventure and some history added in all in one
B004HD61KE|5.0|Interesting weave of American history, archeology, and mind-blowing action! All of my favorite things in one place. Always such a fast paced read you can't put it down and can't believe its over so quickly. Rollins always leaves you salivating for the next book!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love the extra features on this version.  The response is excellent, unlike other versions that I have.  I only gave it four stars because of the advertisements that are so annoying. Definitely worth the money.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|For some reason I'd gotten it into my head that I wanted to read this book, and so I did. And then there was the movie - which of course I had to see because ... well who doesn't read a book and then see it was made into a movie and want to see the result?<br /><br />Now, there are a ton of reviews out there already. So I don't know as mine will matter - especially because I'm going for a 4* and not some extreme or the other.<br /><br />I thought the movie kept pretty close to the book BUT for the person I was watching with I had to explain a lot which makes this one of those \\"REALLY NEED TO READ THE BOOK FIRST\\" types of movies.<br /><br />The person I watched it with thought it was a good movie, but was a bit confused by things,  and I really did have to fill in a LOT of the details that were left out in the movie version. A prime example, and not meant to be a spoiler, but when Katniss and Gale are talking about how many times their names are submitted, there is nothing to tell the person who hasn't read the book why that is important or what it entails. (How many times a name is entered IS very important.)<br /><br />CAST:<br />Excellent. The cast for the movie was absolutely spot on. The only one that had me off a bit was Cinna, but I had gotten a bit of a different impression in reading the books. President Snow maybe just a tad as well, I wasn't expecting someone as ... how do I say this but I think at the Capitol they might have gotten someone who at least *cough* looked younger than Donald Sutherland. He played it well, but ... I think it was mis-cast. When going back to the book, he should have been much younger looking, although \\"enhanced\\" maybe ... it was all a bit off.
B00000634J|5.0|Hands down best &#34;best of album&#34; ever. Forget the Eagles greatest hit. This is John Lennon's finest work on one disc. Couldn't find downloadable version, most likely not available, but whatever.
B00881VLCE|3.0|it is a fun puzzle game. like other reviewers I lost puzzles I had downloaded. that was very frustrating to me
B009GEFXLC|5.0|great. better than the fourth season. s glad they got together. each show gets better and better. look forward to new show this season. discover castle in the fourth season and glad that i did
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Enjoyed the CD, ready for a new one. Enjoyed his on American Idol and hope he continues to put out more good music.
B001P9EQH8|5.0|watch DSLR Film Noob's vid on youtube about audio monitoring on your canon 7d first before you buy this thing.  It will help you understand how to set it all up, and SOOOOOOOOOOOO worth it!
B001B21C8K|5.0|this is a wonderful movie and if you have never seen it watch it very good worth the time and money
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I've had a hard time getting to sleep and staying asleep since s stroke a few years ago.  I get to sleep quickly and stay asleep.  having many options of sounds is great. taking a nap in the afternoon i play the sounds with birds and frogs. at night it's icy snow. well worth the few dollars.
B00004TS0E|5.0|a wonderful holiday movie it can be a tradition in your family like mine  thanks so much i now have both movies
B004HW7JMO|5.0|As with the other spartacus DVD's was full of action and now I know how it all began.  Had watched the other DVD's needed this one to get the whole picture.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|i like this movie my grand kids really liked it too very cute and funny thanks so much for this
B007L6VR6M|4.0|Its a great movie (5 out of 5 stars) but lets talk about the product!<br /><br />I agree with other posters on how the cover looks like someone who hasn't watched the movie make it. The blu-ray is lacking as far as the great commentaries which is expected since its not criterion collection and that is why I gave it only 4 stars. Contains scene walk through for the blind which I thought was cool.<br /><br />As usual, shipped quick and nicely packaged from Amazon, thanks guys
B000HT3PPG|5.0|a wonderful holiday movie it can be a tradition in your family like mine  thanks so much i now have both movies
B004DTXJ4S|4.0|I like the RE series but this one is kind of short on story<br />and the action was kind of short.
B0086700CM|5.0|Totally addicted to this game! The objectives are progressively difficult but attainable. Def try this one! You won't be disappointed.  :)
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I liked the move very and I the way the movie left implications to the Alien movie.<br />and the potential for a sequel.
B005ZOBNOI|2.0|I read two chapters and had to stop.It's not that it isn't well written; the subject matter is just too hard for me to read.
B004EKCNMA|5.0|True to Dickens but SO much more!  I'm not a Jim Carrey fan but this movie is so well done, I can get past him.  Our new family favorite version!
B004J64QSI|5.0|Les Miserables is wonderful and the 25th anniversary edition does not disappoint. It was great to see the clips from older versions
B00A1XOPE8|5.0|This is a great book.  Obviously it's not as long as other Sanderson books, but you know that going in.  I enjoyed it and I loved the reduced price for the ebook (cheaper than the paperback, finally!).  Definitely worth a read for any Sanderson fan.
006197806X|3.0|A lot of series I read, the second book in the series is never as good as the first one. But in this case, I like Pandemonium so much more.<br /><br />The second book in the Delirium series, Pandemonium, I found a lot different from the first book. It almost come across as a different book, just with the same main character, Lena. I didn't really like Lena in the first book, and I found she was still pretty annoying in this one as well. Just not as much. I did find a lot of growth with her character from the first book. Which I liked. She wasn't as naive as I found her in the first book.<br /><br />After starting Pandemonium, something I found I didn't like was that the chapters skip from past to present. I'm not a huge fan of flashbacks, so going into this book I did find myself hesitate to continue reading. But I was far to curious about what was going to happen and what was going on to stop.<br /><br />The romance *sigh* ( not the good kind of sigh). I am a huge Alex fan. Alex is what saved the first book for me. So for him not being in this book sucked. But I got over that and just continued reading. But then we meet Julian. First let me say what I did like about it. In the first book it was Alex that taught Lena that love was okay. And in this book Lena did the same for Julian, as Alex did for her. I really liked how that linked to the first book, otherwise it would have seemed liked two different books. But moving on, Alex, great male character, so for Lena to (what seemed like automatically) move on to Julian, was disappointing. It made it seem like what Alex and Lena had in the first book wasn't that \\"real\\". Now I may be a little, just a little biased when it comes to Alex, but I didn't like Julian at all. I would have rather there be no romance in this book. Okay, the romance wasn't THAT bad, but like I said I might be biased. ;)<br /><br />The ending, at least for me, was no surprise. Nonetheless, I still found myself chanting \\"Yes,yes,yes\\". The ending made me very happy, but still annoyed because I have to wait for the third book.<br /><br />The writing, just like the first book, was beautifully written. I did really like Pandemonium more than Delirium. And the fact that this one was better for me than the first one, makes me think the third one will be even better. If you wasn't a huge fan of Delirium, I would recommend still reading this book, because it really did seem like a different book.e me very happy, but still annoyed because I have to wait for the third book.<br /><br />The writing, just like the first book, was beautifully written.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham it the nail on the head with this book, the characters are believable and the book is fast paced. I would recommend it to anyone.
0345525558|5.0|Such a treat.  Didn't want this book to end.  A touching story of a young troubled girl who ultimately finds a way to engage with the world through her love of flowers.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Not as good as their debut album in my opinion, but only by a slight amount.  I'd definitely say to buy the deluxe edition for the Simon & Garfunkel cover!
0307743659|5.0|This was the first book i read by Stephen King.<br />let me tell you something : this is for sure his masterpiece and one of the greatest book ever made in the horror genre!<br />It's just his third book (after Carrie and Salem's lot) but it's already mature and soon became his masterpiece.<br />Buy it and you won't be disappointed!
B0053TMP24|5.0|My son has loved all of the books in both series at this point and has been happier with each bookl
B000059H1Z|1.0|DVD sent was for wrong region. Why would I buy a DVD you can't play in the US??  Apparently the region was stated but I believe I was misled.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a fabulous series for children to read.  It does have some borderline language if if that is something you want to monitor that.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Excellent pacing, perfect casting. The story lines are ever-changing and keeps things from getting dull. Always excited to see what happens next.
B002VHI8FE|4.0|The story line moved well and even better there are very few spelling errors or use of wrong words compared to other books I've recently read.
B004QOB8SO|5.0|Like the movie as season one! Great adaptation of the classical story. Recommend strongly if you like Sherlock Holmes stories.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I love this! I now use it instead of my auctual alarm clock. Use the setting beep beep beeb and make the volume gradually increase. (:
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Season 3 doesn't disappoint; one of the best shows on TV. I highly recommend this show to anyone interested in drama.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|First I played with 4 adults.  We had a blast, laughing at ourselves and our rolls.  Then I played with daughter's family including children aged 8-13.  We had so much fun they begged to play over and over through my entire visit (month).  Well worth it and not at all scary.
B0079R8KXG|5.0|I wanted a good case for my Kindle Fire, but didn't want to spend a great deal. This fit the bill perfectly! My Kindle fits nicely/snugly, so I don't worry about it falling out. It's also nicely protected inside. My 7-year old has dropped it (with the case on) a few times, and nary a scratch or scuff.<br /><br />The front and spine are smooth, with most of the back having a very narrow-lined texture. It's not leather, but it looks nice -- and the red is a true red -- not candy-apple, but not dark either. The inside is nicely lined, with a suede-like finish. The elastic seems like it will hold up well, and has for last 5 months I've been using it. I've not had any problem with positioning it in whatever way I need it.<br /><br />Overall, for the price, this is a great cover for your Kindle Fire. I should note that my Fire is not the one that just came out, so I cannot speak to how it would fit the newest Fire.
1449410243|4.0|Disclaimer: I'm a fan of Matthew Inman, nee The Oatmeal, as well as cats. So, this book is right in my wheelhouse, and for the most part, It's great. There are some new comics in the book that are never before seen, some extended Bobcats frames (truly classic) as well as Cat vs. Internet. People new to the Oatmeal or not keen on cats will likely be better served by his prior book, 5 Very Good Reasons to Punch a Dolphin in the Mouth. That tome has more variety in the comics as well as some truly classic ones as well.<br /><br />That said, this book is well worth picking up if you're fans of cats or the author.
B008476HBM|5.0|Of course you know why this rating is a five. Pride and Prejudice is one of the most amazing love stories I've EVER read. Honestly the writing style is not something I could read often, but this is a beautiful-reach in and touch your soul kind of read...<br />Of course the movie is amazing as well, but I stand by what I always say-The book is ALWAYS better.
B008CJ0JTI|5.0|I'm a huge fan of this film, as well as its director, David Fincher, and cinematographer, the late Harris Savides. This Criterion edition of The Game on Blu-Ray is a huge step up from the budget release I previously owned on DVD. The transfer seems to be a new one as a lot of the black crush in the many dim scenes present on the DVD release are nowhere to be found. The transfer is spectacular and really must be seen to be appreciated fully.<br /><br />The movie is a top 10 all time for me, so to have a release that allows me to fully appreciate the film is an instant 5 star for me.
B007SGM084|5.0|Will read over and over again I was prob one of the last woman on earth to read this book
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I LOVE this game!  I keep telling myself, &#34;Just one more&#34;,,,,,well, that never works.  lol  HOURS later I have to force myself out of this game.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book while it does have some repetitive words is really good. I loved it! I feel I must mention that while there are repetitive actions it doesn't detract from the book. Think about this how many times you raise your eyebrow, cock your head to the side, or bite your lip. Many of us don't realize we are doing these things several times per day. When you read it yes it seems excessive but I suggest before knocking this book that you count how many times you do these in one day.<br />  I feel that many of women that didn't like this book expected it to be a romantic book. They didn't expect a hardcore sex book. It is erotica. It is BDSM erotica which is not usually soft and fluffy. This stuff is the makings of women's deepest, darkest fantasies. E.L. James is an excellent sex scene writer. The sex scenes were hot and were not too long nor too short. They showed the engagement between the characters. Best of all they were detailed.<br />For women who don't think having an orgasm every time is not possible - you are wrong. You are with the wrong person or most likely are a woman who can not let go with wild abandon. If you have had a &#34;spark&#34; or magnetic attraction to a man you will know what I speak of. The physical side of your relationship is amazing.<br />Some of the best scenes in here are the emails going back and forth between Ana and Christian. This book can stand alone but does work best when you read the whole series. Book 2 must be read in order to really understand parts of book 1. By the time you are done reading all three books you will not only have read a great erotic book, but a mystery, a thriller, and a romance book as well.<br />I stand by my review...though only read if you can take explicit sexual scenes.
B002RI9SC4|5.0|Fantastic story, well written, perfect for your imagination.  Great love story, keeps you reading.  The ending leaves you wondering if there is more
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Yes, this is indeed a darker book! We get to know more about Christian and his 50 Shades. We also get to know more about what Ana likes and what she will or won't do. We get introduced to Christian's family and see more examples of how he wields power. I am a person who likes character development and I am glad E.L. James took the time to develop the story. Again I think all of the books are best read as a trilogy. Each book builds upon the last one. Excellent!
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I really enjoyed this sequel to the first Sherlock Holmes movie which was also great.  If you liked the first one, you will likely enjoy this one also.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I loved this book and books 1 and 2. I will definitely be reading these again! If E.L. James writes more I will read more. Oh, I do believe that there will be some guys that can learn some stuff in these books. However, as a woman we got to tell or show our man what we like.<br />Women be open minded to these books. I know if you are considering this book you will have like and most likely read books 1 and 2. I mean - at the end of 2 you surely can't just stop. You must pick up book 3!! Once finished you will feel you want more and more and more....and just maybe there will be...I hope so.
1408173352|5.0|This play was a hit at London's National Theatre and I can see why.  It is a gem! Charming, funny touching and more...
B002BWP49C|5.0|After I ordered this movie,  I received it within a couple of days. Very fast transaction and movie and bonus feature disc were in perfect condition.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and trying the various recipes and techniques. It is a bit ADD though. There are seemingly random bursts of information sprinkled throughout each chapter. It all makes sense after reading through, but it makes it a bit difficult on first pass to keep switching trains of thought.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book brought the trilogy together.  Although the books were rather fast-paced I enjoyed the plot and this one invited more characters.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I really don't consider myself a murder mystery fan, but this was not formulaic at all. Couldn't put it down.
0062024329|5.0|Well, since I had already, many times, read the actual book when I learned there was a graphic novel version I had decided that it'd be cool to see it since I loved the real book so much. Well, I haven't read all of it but I have to say that it really compliments the story; the best part is that when a book is turned into a graphic novel sometimes they ruin the mystery, the letting the reader decide what they look like, etc. part, by creating an illustration of a character or setting that the user/read made so much more beautiful and with the case of this, IMHO, what they did was good because it didn't try too hard and it ended up coming out pretty similar to the book.<br /><br />The only things, specifically, that made me feel off about the book was some things seemed too modern for the time that I felt like the book was set in, but I guess that could be blamed on my own doing. E.g. The illustrated gun, but that was all I can't think of off the top of my head.<br /><br />I'd definitely recommend getting this or getting a hold of it from/at a library, but probably only after you've read and liked the actual book. :D
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Its gonna make my sister cry and feel all warm and fuZy at the same time! A great true story!
B009V3KKXY|4.0|Instructions are really easy to follow and results are fast to achieve. A must for every paracord enthusiast. And the providers links saved me a lot of Internet searches.
B000UNYK3A|4.0|Its bloody, gory, and full of nudity. What else can you ask in a horror movie? If you want a good horror experience go for this. The sequals are crap though.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|For simple calculations, it's fine.  I haven't had much chance to use it as yet.  I'll know more after a few weeks.
B00005V9IK|5.0|Non stop action, and good special effects. This is a good movie. Buy it if you get the chance but dont pay to much.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Really nice work.  This book is so enlightening and Dr. Alexander's description of the &#34;death of matter&#34; experience is wonderful.  This so parallels the metaphysical teachings that many of us study and practice.  The fact that mind resides outside of the body, the brain, and that life is truly spiritual, above the mental view that we entertain in this so called physical state, was demonstrated by the Doctor.<br /><br />As one who practices spiritual healing, I can attest that his experience very closely aligns with those spiritual facts that I have experienced myself.  It was delightful to hear of his experience and to share the exhilaration of knowing that this &#34;dream&#34; of living in so called matter, is not the end of existence.
B0000524CY|5.0|If you havent seen the Exorcist then you should see it already. This is one of the best horror movies of all time.
B00271SFB6|5.0|Didn't care for his first or third Bond films but he really nailed it on Casino Royale. Read the book, too, though - it's entirely different beyond the names of the characters, but also excellent.
B0044XV3R8|3.0|This is a movie for kids but it does have some adult themes. Its special effects are good, and its probably aimed tword enviromentalists.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Utility that is needed by almost everyone who uses a computer. Well known trusted company that makes installation a breeze
B001RJTFP4|4.0|He isnt van hellsing thats for sure. He is a ass kicking vampire slayer that doesnt take names. Id take him over the monster squad any day.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Worth a read.. a real look into the prison system. Not a subject I thought would interest me , but well written by someone not too different from me. Definitely kept my interest and had me turning pages quickly to find out how it would all turn out.
B0041KKYEM|1.0|I was expecting to see a horror movie, and what I got was a movie about ballet pretending to be a horror movie. Sorry but it just doesnt workf or me
B0011XBLUS|5.0|it was really excellent!! i love it. this is what im looking for. now i can enjoy it! thank you.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|Good acting from Jennifer Lawrence, and the entire cast. Could have been more violent but hey its a kids movie in some ways, buy it anyway.
B002BWP49M|5.0|it was really excellent!! i love it. this is what im looking for. now i can enjoy it! thank you.
B004SBQGHS|5.0|What else can you say about one of the most popular games in the world? It's great to play on Android, and this one doesn't disappoint. Now I have to get the theme song out of my head!

B000X107GI|4.0|This is a pretty sandard size battery for a lithium. It's used in pretty much every computer since 1998. Maxell makes relatively decent batteries, but these do the job.<br /><br />We have an ear thermometer for my 4 yr old kid, and it uses these batteries. The one in the device didn't last 6 months. One of these new Maxells is on year 2, and still going strong.

B0036EH3WK|5.0|it was really excellent!! i love it. this is what im looking for. now i can enjoy it! thank you.
B005NJU8PA|3.0|I have The Four Hour Body book and absolutely love it- I've only read a third of it but it's because you don't have to- you read what interests you.  But flipping through a book and swiping your finger on your iPad are two different things - also- the recipes I found were tiny - I didn't like the format since you have to read through his jibber jabber about how to be efficient.  I like my old fashioned recipes written out.  I would have more patience for it in the paper edition and may have a totally different review and more patience for it.
B0015AARJI|5.0|it was really excellent!! i love it. this is what im looking for. now i can enjoy it! thank you.
0440246008|5.0|I acciently came across this book in a food chain store and liked the dark blue New York Scene cover.  I loved it and it is still my favourite Lee Child book.<br /><br />A man sitting in a cafe minding his own business get invited, and then dragged into a bogus kidnapping, a maniac husband and a group of ex-miliary, ex-mercenary bad men.<br /><br />Reacher is his name, Jack Reacher.  A 6'5 200+ rock of a guy who is capable of looking after just about anything and anyone.  Ex-miltary himself, Reacher never looks for trouble.  It just finds him.  Once you read something about him, you want to read all about him.<br /><br />The hard way is about survival of the fitness against a bunch of ruthless men who follow one man all for money.  Reacher is a man's man's, a woman's man, every man.<br /><br />The hard way is a riverting read, exciting, tense with enough humor to make it an all round wonderful and enjoyable book.  It twists, it turns, and Lee Child is a genious writer.<br /><br />When ever I think of Jack Reacher, I think of Tom Selleck.  How perfect he would have been in the Movie or TV movie role as Jack Reacher.<br /><br />Hope you enjoyed my review!  And check out this book!<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0084U0OOK The Essential Jack Reacher 10-Book Bundle: Persuader, The Enemy, One Shot, The Hard Way, Bad Luck and Trouble, Nothing to Lose, Gone Tomorrow, 61 Hours, Worth Dying For, The Affair]]

B000003FD9|5.0|This Red Seal performance by Janos Starker from the 1990s can be compared with his Mercury Living Presence performance from the 1960s.  Both are eminently listenable exquisitely pure cello.
B005LAIHR2|5.0|I love musicals and this was such an awesome one! I loved the rock music, but some parts of the movie were not authentic.
B00004R99L|5.0|This original edition of the movie, as released in the 1950s, is endlessly watchable.  The mono sound track plays like a symphony.  We love it, our children love it, and are now loving it with our grandkids.
B00992CF6W|4.0|i think the game is great but the pc version has so many more things redstone needs to be mineable
B007MU85D0|5.0|I can play this CD through and enjoy every song! I often have the problem where I buy a CD because I like a few songs, and there's obviously a reason those songs are the popular ones, because the rest are disappointing. Not the case with this CD!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Mitch Rapp is getting older, but that isn't slowing him down.  another exciting tale from Vince Flynn.  I highly recommend this book to all Rapp lovers
B008OOYALE|4.0|I enjoy the game but everything is so expensive using the games coins... I never spend real money on these games. but come on, clearing a tree shouldn't cost that much...
B008WCP2PG|5.0|This movie is a great movie!!! If you like channing tatum you will love this. The plot of the movie seems like it is really happening, the dialogue between characters seems down to earth and real. Good Movie!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very good plot.  Survival, love, betrayal are all explored in this book.<br /><br />Love how the book ended; who will she choose?  Can't wait to start the next one.
B00992CF6W|3.0|I would love to uby it here but I could also get it at apple for 0.99 or something make it cheap
B008FC4WA4|4.0|I love anything Nick Hornby's written, to bits. I was saving this one for the next time I have to spend hours at an airport. Good thing I didn't, because it wouldn't have lasted. It's the Nick Hornby I know, his easy-to-read style, his deep big Truths About Life delivered in a matter-of-fact way, but hey! it ends way too soon.
B006O6F932|5.0|i loved it it was asome it was so great to find it i so recommend it to everyone thank you
141659521X|5.0|Only problems with Vince Flynn Books is they only arrive once per year, and I can finish them off in a couple days. Great book as always.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved all three of the books.  I enjoyed the Twilight series but thought this series was even better.  Now I cannot wait for the movies.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|For whatever reason I was on the fence about this knife. I read numerous reviews about this knife and they were all spectaular. This knife is basically a sharpened prybar. I'be only read about one breaking and it was due to it being used as a throwing knife. This is now my go to knife for everything in the field from chopping to wood processing to cleaning game. The only thing that was left to be desired is the sheath. While adequate you could easily make your own kydex sheath or purchase one of many after market ones. That being said, if you are on the fence about it just do it! You will not be disappointed!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|My stepson loves everything superhero so I bought this for his birthday. He absolutely loved it. I definitely recommend this movie.
B00AHU52G0|2.0|The same old same old, another cop show with a so-called best selling author sidekick. This kind of show has been done to death. ANOTHER cop show? Adding a writer of fiction cop books to the same old same old mix is something new?<br />It was cute for the first season, all that sexual tension between them, but now that's over and now the show is slowly dying. It won't see another season.
B0093COK4S|5.0|The new album by Sandra is absolutely what the fans of the 80's sound have been waiting for!<br />Songs kept in the style of Sandra early style (Kings and Queens resembles Maria Magdalena, Between Me and the Moon resembles Secret Land/La Vista Vista de Luna, Sand Heart seems like Midnight Man...) but with modern arrangements. The addition of male chorus  by Huber Kah,  instrumental lines known from the earlier Sandra albums, all this  gives the album an exceptional sound. If you are a fan of the eighties,you will love it! It takes you back to the days of Maria Magdalena, but promises well - it seems Sandra is back for good ;)
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I was looking forward to reading this book when it was pre-offered for free- and it did not disappoint.<br /><br />Waking Up Married is a light read. It was funny at times and made me smile. Not to deep, but neither were the characters flat. They both had relationship hang ups based on their childhood experiences which drove the storyline- but at the same time I was not engaged or moved by their struggles.<br /><br />Synopsis: Man and woman meet in Las Vegas at a bar. Have a evening of drinking and fun which ends with them waking up married. He remembers the evening and why he wanted to marry her, she does not. He convinces her to trial the marriage until she is sure. She gets sure about staying married so he panics and pushes her away. She leaves, he follows...a few times. Oh, and she is on a plan to get pregnant via IV before they meet. They both want babies. I am sure its supposed to be gripping and emotional but I didnt feel it.<br /><br />Why did I like it? I enjoy male leads who see value and chase a woman and convince her to fall in love with them. He was sure of himself without being arrogant or rude. She was unsure of him and the marriage without being insecure or having low self-esteem.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Great plot with a character who is too real and with great intelligence. One of his best stories. Pleanty of surpises, suspense, fears and excitement. My Kindle had to be cooled off after speeding through these pages.
1401233384|4.0|I found the whole flashpoint event to be amazing but somehow this combination of books in this graphic novel/Trade to be disappointing. Yes, it told the correct story. Yes, it was in chronographical order. Yes, the art work was truly AMAZING! But somehow at the end I was just, ehh. It is what it is.<br /><br />Quick and precise shipping too.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Good story line, witty, insights to a little known country and our (US) involvements. The sarcastic main character is one most of identify with.

B004V5A7K8|2.0|I played this about 10 minutes until I realized how easy it was. What I didn't like was that you have to start over from the beginning every time. But I'm used to games that let you move onto other levels and pickup where you left off.
B000ZHCQ5U|5.0|I can't really say anything bad about this film. It's honestly my favorite of all time. For awhile, it was very hard to pinpoint my favorite film of all time, but after a recent watching of Dr. Strangelove, I've realized why it's so great. It's just so ahead of it's time, but so much better then anything created nowadays.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|Nothing beats repurposing the old classic movies on yet another platform. First, Family Guy, and now Angry birds. Star Wars will never fade.
B004EPYZSU|5.0|I can't remeber even seeing this movie advertised.  If I had I probably would not have seen it because of the name.  However, the movie was good!  I really enjoyed it!  It was suprisingly different for an alien movie yet the same in that aliens are the bad guys and they are here to kill us.  The story was enjoyable.  Not a very deep story but I was not looking for a shocker storyline either.  Great movie for those that like alien movies and action.
B0052BZ6X8|4.0|This was like a combination of the TV series heroes and the x-men series all wrapped up into one. But this is even better because you know there will be an end to it rather than going on, and on, and on.
B009MF56GC|5.0|Come on!! How can you not enjoy an action movie with a bunch of old action movie stars acting undistructable and making fun of each other and themselfs at the same time.  Plus the story is good and entertaining.  Of course it is impossible and perdictable.  IT IS AN ACTION MOVIE WITH A BUNCH OF OLD ACTORS.  So enjoy it and have fun!!  Plus some of them act better in this movie than they ever did in anything else they did!
B007C9N4H8|4.0|As we started watching this, we got so involved that we forgot that the muppet movies are musicals. And then...they broke out in song! It was hilarious.
1449410243|5.0|Love the variety of chuckles within.  And all is absolutely true – histerical. very happy with the purchase, and have given it to several others as gifts.
B009GEEMLY|4.0|This was hilarious from the beginning. All of these guys working with each other to accomplish their goal was hilarious.
B004LWZWBU|4.0|good acting for a difficult subject, as a birder it was good to laugh at ones self, see how focused some folks are, notice all the subtle birding idiosyncrasies & know this was geared for comedy most folks would not get...
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I'm not much a 'seek and find' game person. But this game couples that with some real thinking and exploration. A great go-between of a seek and find and Myst/Riven. I also liked that I did not need to take notes because it does that for you in a journal. And it was nice to play a game like this and beat it in just a few hours.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Honestly,if you think you are interested in this book and are at all a fan of Tim Ferriss and his other work you should just buy this.
B004U8ZH8S|4.0|Once again, Disney really captured some personality! You're watching the movie, waiting for the guy and the girl to get together. But then you're blindsided by the horse who is HILARIOUS!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|THIS BOOK IS ONE IN MANY BY MORGAN RICE THAT I HAVE READ; I THINK THAT THIS SERIES IS GOING TO GO TO THE TOP; I CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT ONE.

B0092C2X7U|4.0|this game was a great idea. It really simulates the movements of the body very well. Although sometimes if you land at a strong angle, the game 'gives' it to as if you landed upright. But otherwise, very well done.

B002I0J5FG|5.0|The graphics are amazing and I absolutely love the tiny and subtle changes to some of the puzzles. The small changes add a challenge to people who have played the original. =) Six stars if I could.
B00319KS7C|3.0|It was ok. Based on a true story. I dont think the real Mark Whitacre was as dumb as they portrayed
034553154X|5.0|I love the artwork in this calendar. I have the 2012 version too, and I thought the illustrations in the 2013 one are much better.
B0047Y0FGY|2.0|Was not nearly as funny as I had hoped......skimmed parts of it because it lost my interest. And I generally like Tina Fey
B008M62KJI|4.0|I wish they would put out new music and tour the USA again, especially Las Vegas, but I had to get this album for the great remixes of some of their old classics.
B007DIQC90|4.0|Liked it a lot.  The hook was Little Talksl, but I found most of the songs good and refreshingly different
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I just finished reading this book for a book club and LOVED it!! I couldn't put it down once I started it. I finished it quickly. Most of the chapters were very short. So before I'd go to bed, I would say to myself \\"Just one more chapter. Just one more.\\" And before I knew it, I was done with the book. It was definitely a good read and a tear-jerker. So glad we chose this book. I'd recommend to everyone. Just make sure you have tissues handy.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I flew through this book I enjoyed it so much. I never would have guessed the ending. Still wondering how much she knew.
B0015AARJI|2.0|in a matter of three months i had to replace it.<br />. . . . . . . . .
B00008J2DQ|5.0|Coming off the success of their first two albums 'Godsmack' followed up with 'Awake', Godsmack really took the scene by surprise, I know when I first bought the debut album around the time it came out, I know I was pleasantly surprised, since I bought it on a whim, being a huge Alice in Chains fan, and since the name Godsmack is one of their song titles, I had to check it out, and I'm sure glad I did, the album blew me away with it's energy, and was eagerly awaiting their next album which came 2 years later in the form of 'Awake' which not only continued the greatness, but maybe even gotten better at it, with a much tighter sound, and excellent songwriting, so could they make it 3 in a row?<br /><br />A resounding YES is the answer, they blew me away for the third time in a row, pretty hard to do, I'm fussy, and I was pleased to find out that this album is not really similar to the first two, and that's a good thing, the first two albums are masterpieces, but I like when a band tries something a bit different, because with this one, they went for a much heavier sound, I mean yeah, the first two are heavy as hell, but this one is much heavier, sort of a cross between Metallica and Alice in Chains, but they still add their own style, the sound here is even tighter and heavier than the previous album 'Awake' which was tight as hell, as well as the first one, and you can tell right off with the hit single 'Straight out of Line' which is just great pumped up song with great riffs and vocals, and a sweet solo, and that will set the tone for the rest of the album.<br /><br />I won't do a track-by-track review, but my favorites are 'Straight out of Line' 'Faceless' 'Changes' 'I Stand Alone' 'I Hate You' (I can't say the other word and keep this review clean) 'Releasing the Demons' and 'Dead and Broken' but all of the songs are good, you can play this album all the way through without getting bored.<br /><br />So bottom line, Godsmack fan? liked what they did on the first two albums? you need to get this one, and the next one as well 'IV', I'm sure you will love both!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great read. Enjoyed all five books, can't wait for the movie!!And for that price, it's surely a bargain. Hugh is a bit of a genius
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I waited so long to watch this movie (with a newborn baby, we couldn't see it when it came out) and it was every bit as good as I expected it to be. Nolan took Batman and Bruce Wayne and made a faithful, 'dark' rendition of it in Batman Begins. But in this movie, he took them and made them completely his own.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|This show is really engaging and very intense.  there have be quite a few big twist that i was astounded at what had just happened and i can normally see things coming before others do
B003O86FMW|5.0|I couldn't stop reading. The story is well thought out. I could read this book again and again. Can't wait to read the next book.
B0060D123K|5.0|I enjoyed this remake, very funny but still gets all the important parts of the story Christmas Carol out.  I really enjoyed watching this movie.
0395925037|5.0|i believe i ordered the wrong book but once i started to read this book it was pretty interesting and hopefully its good in the end
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|very fun game. its very addicting and takes the place of playing the real ones in arcades! love the found effects. too.

0547884591|5.0|I'll keep it short: Tim Ferriss is the most interesting man in the world. He has three NYT best sellers, a gold medal in kickboxing, a fantastic blog/website, a revolutionary diet, intriguing philanthropies/investments, one of the most efficient workouts, and the list goes on.<br /><br />Read the book!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Very entertaining.  It was a winner with all of my family.  We can't wait for the lastest installment to come out.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I loved the excitement, the thrill, and the like. I just can't wrap my head around why he wouldn't try harder for her if he cared for her as much as he portrayed! Come on Christian! The next two better redeem him or I will be seriously disappointed. Otherwise great plot.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Wonderful, many hours of pure enjoyment here.  The characters are brilliant and the plot just keeps drawing you in.  Can't wait for season 4.
B009CPJHY4|4.0|This movie was sweet.  I enjoyed watching the characters interact, learn and grow together. Refreshing clean movie. The setting made me feel as if I were in India as well.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Sparks is an amazing author and this book was very good. suspenseful, interesting and def a thrill ride. loved it!
B0098VXBIA|4.0|This is a cute movie. Made me laugh. Sweet entertainment. Not a movie for my husband but I enjoyed it.
B000T433CO|3.0|i ENJOYED THE MULTIPLE RELATIONSHIPS INCLUDING THE FRIENDSHIP WITH THE OLDER CHARACTER--THE MEANING OF TRUST AND CHANGE IN RELATIONSHIPS WAS ALSO A THEME.  FEEL GOOD ROMANTIC COMEDY
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|There is so much  to do in this game, I don't know if I will ever figure it all out. Very challenging!
B005S9EJ14|4.0|THE CAST WAS PHENOMENAL.  IT PORTRAYS THE PLIGHT OF THE RETIRING SENIORS IN ENGLISH AND I SUSPECT OTHER WESTERN COUNTRIES AS WELL.  CHANGES IN FAMILY DYNAMICS AND THE NEED FOR A COMMUNITY IN ANY LIVING ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE VENTURE.  THE CHARACTERS WERE COMPELLING AND DESIRE FOR ADVENTURE IS PRESENT NO MATTER WHAT AGE WE ARE.
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|This is a great collection of Hawaiian superstars.  Highly recommend it for enjoyment of a variety of styles of music.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|A calculator for your basic needs when you just want something quick. Exactly what I wanted. Never freezes and retains the previous entries
B009FZHYKU|5.0|The seasons just keep getting better and better...makes you think what can they think of next to help bring the next season more suspense. A true essence of life and death with the feel of reality blended with the unreal. A true family versus those who are out for number one at whatever the cost. I highly recommend watching this season and continuing to follow the seasons as they progress. I would love for this to be on year round but I know the tv networks don't work that way. They have to give time for summer and winter breaks.. Enjoy and I hope this encourages you to watch the Walking Dead. If you miss an episode, Amazon has seasons for rent online at just a $1.99. It is so worth it. We would have been so lost if we hadn't have gotten episode 6 of this season before catching up on the other two episodes afterward that included the season finale! Wow what an ending...bringing two brothers together and then have to wait and see if one or the other will die twice!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|After finishing the Came of Thrones series needed something else to read of quality. Was curious about the series after all the positive reviews and thought I would give the bundle a shot. An exceptionally well written sci-fi/thriller series. I read all five books in about 4 days (which is saying something for me). I highly recommend reading this if anyone wants an engrossing story and needs a more than one book non-tedious series.
0307730697|5.0|Wow, what an incredible human being Adam Brown was.  Only 1% of the military could get to the level he was and he did so with one eye and messed up ankles and legs?!!  Dang, he was like a super hero.  And his family seem like the most loving and giving souls, my heart goes out to them for their loss.  And someone getting thru drug addiction to this level is more amazing.  I admire all our military for selflessly giving their lives so I can live my comfortable life.
0316069434|4.0|and that makes it feel very good. After a couple of red herrings, the reader can feel where the bad guy(s) were all along, this becomes a good little procedural. The ending is a nice nasty bit. Connelly is back in the game.
B007HACDLK|4.0|While not Vince Flynn's best Mitch Rapp story, I couldn't put it down until it was finished and then I hate that I read so fast because now that I've finished, I have to wait another year for the next one!<br /><br />Intriguing story line, great action sequences and a few surprises too.  Another great read!
B007Z9QWVK|1.0|I have a strong interest in the Duke and Duchess of Windsor's story, which is why I rented this movie.  Too little of W.E. (Wallis and Edward) and too much much of an American woman in a seemingly loveless and definitely abusive marriage.  I stuck with it to the end but if I could have edited out the wife-in-bad-marriage half of the movie, it would have been much more interesting.  I did like Madonna's thesis that King Edward was not the only one who make a huge sacrifice for this marriage.  Wallis Warfield Simpson gave up her comfortable marriage to become the reviled wife of an exiled former king.  Wallis and Edward's story is fascinating, but you would barely know it from this movie.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The one thing you can be certain of is that picking up a Vince Flynn novel will cost you some sleep. From the first page to the last Flynn grabs your attention and holds it. Mitch Rapp continues to grow with each story - his conviction and dedication to his country never waiver even as he ages. Few authors bring you a consistent theme with intriguing twists and very believable characters. One problem with Flynn's books - once you have read one - he's gotcha.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Typical Grisham--good story and well written and entertaining, but not very substantial. However, I will probably read his next book next year.
B00000294R|5.0|I had never heard of Big L until a couple months ago, and boy was I missing out!  This highly underrated rapper has mad flow and sick rhymes.  This album is ten times better than anything released in the 2000's.  Big L makes Lil' Wayne sound like he never graduated from elementary school.
B008K6DU4Y|1.0|It shows your downloaded movies, but they will only play for a few seconds. Sadly, this app is useless on this device.
B0034G4P94|5.0|What an emotional heart throbbing movie based on a true story. Well acted by all cast members, I will continue to love this for a long time.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Although it took me a while to adjust and learn the short cuts, it's a great keyboard. Extremely intuitive. I'm amazed at how many short cuts there are. I really like this, and would suggest it to any Android user.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Exciting Flynn intricacy. I share Rapp,s dislike for the Washington insiders and trust no one environment. Can't wait for next installment.
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|I am disappointed in Angry Birds.  I have to be connected to the internet to play.  If I am on the road, it does not help me.

B008FYZIVY|5.0|Fine compilation of the first 2 seasons of this new classic.  Once you start watching you will be hooked.  The writing and acting is wonderful.
B0069JBKHI|4.0|The monitor works great. I love that I can hear and see my child from anywhere in the world. I have very little bad to say about this product. The reason it can't get 5 stars from me is because there are two improvements I believe that need to be made and should have been included from the beginning.<br />1. You can only view, continuously, from a cellular network for 5 minutes at a time. I can't find a good reason for this.<br />2. You can't play YOUR music to the baby. There is a list of 5 default lullabies that come with the monitor but I would prefer to play the songs I choose from my phone to my child.<br /><br />If they  get those changes, which can probably just be software changes, I would GLADLY give it 5 stars. Even with those flaws it is the best monitor that I have seen.
B002DEZXOE|5.0|Great DVD! I have always enjoyed the music and the scenery from Woodstock, and I have always wanted to own the DVD
B000GCFY0I|4.0|This story is filled with great ideas and a wonderful look on current, and future, society. I want to see a lot more character development. This is a great start though. Keep improving and keep up the good work.
0812548094|5.0|One of the best book series ever known to mankind. This is the second of twelve, and if you are at book #2 then you KNOW you have to keep reading! Read this book!!
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This story is so intriguing! I couldn't put it down. It was filled with guesses and wild accusations, conspiracies and down right thrills. Wonderful work. Keep it up!
B004LWZWGK|1.0|first off this review is not about the dark kinght rises, it is about the ultraviolet digital copy.<br /><br />the blue-ray dvd combo promises a digital copy for us to download into our computer but what it didn't tell you that you downloading more than what you want.<br /><br />you have to make two account on two different websites and by the time you get to the download part it have yo download another program and the worst part is that<br />you still don't get a digital copy in your computer.<br /><br />ul;traviolet is crap and if you want a digital copy for yoruself buy it in either itunes or burn the dvd.
B000JQU4TW|5.0|This book has always been one of my favorites and that hasn't changed. I love it! Such a compelling story.
0375842209|5.0|I thought this was a wonderfully written book.  Yes, the style become a bit much towards the end but I thought the story and the characters were beautifully described.  Of course I am attuned to the story because I lived in Berlin (although only in the later 1930's) and have felt some of the atmosphere in Germany at that time.  The three children, to me, were the core of the story and I have always had an affinity for young children who have to suffer because of what adults have wrought.<br /><br />The fact that Death is the narrator and (and busy) protagonist is very good choice.<br /><br />I felt deeply about the characters and found the writing suitable to the subject matter.
B00ADYZTLS|4.0|Skip the first about 5 tracks after Paperbond, that's the  filler no substance , I have so much money wiz part. After, the album is straight bangers.<br />If you like Taylor Allderdice mixtape, you would like this album.
B005LAIIDU|5.0|Family decided to go to the movies out of the blue which I usually despise because it always happens when there's nothing good out. This film was an exception. It tells the story of Ralph, the antagonist of a popular retro videogame entitled \\"Fix it Felix Junior\\". Ralph's job is to destroy a penthouse inhabited by a number of citizens while the protagonist, Felix Junior  is tasked with repairing  the Damage Ralph causes.At the end of everyday the game resets and the Characters are free to do as they please. The citizens of the Penthouse throw a party  in honor of Felix complete with music, dancing and a cake replica of the penthouse. Feeling left out, Ralph visits the Penthouse and convinces Felix to let him in for a piece of cake. The inhabitants treat him hostily and an argument ensues ending with Ralph destroying the cake and vowing to win a medal to prove that though he's programmed to be a bad guy, he can be a hero as well.He sets off to do so.<br /><br />Enough summary.<br /><br />Judging from the previews I expected this movie to rely on Cameos for success and not pay much attention to story but I was wrong.The story is great. It has the right balance of comedy and action. Not all of the humor was potty themed. There's what could be called slapstick and a parody of several shooter cliche's. Ralph is a very likeable character and as rounded as possible given the circumstances. In the end he becomes content with who he is in leiu of the drastic changes that usually occur in stories like this where a zero becomes an overly glamourized hero.(That's not to say EVERYTHING stays completely the same.)<br /><br />Ralph's main companion Vanelope von Shweets is also a loveable character. Like Ralph she also goes against her programming to achieve her dreams. While she is not a hero,  they managed to avoid  making her a Mary Sue. She resides in a japanese racing game called Sugar Rush but is never allowed to race due to be ing an alleged glitch chararacter that could put the game out of order. Despite being forbidden, she is determined to be a racer and is aided several times by Ralph.<br /><br />As far as content goes I can't see anything that would be too bad for a kid to watch(with the exception of the scene where the embodiment of all shooter stereotypes punches Felix Jr several times, each disfiguring his face horribly before he fixes it with his hammer but despite realistic sounds it's much more comical than  violent.  I wouldn't worry about it.)<br /><br />The main villan is simplistic and easily defeated but it didn't take away from the story in any way. I can't say much more without spoiling the plot but I recommend this movie. It features many of the Characters us gamers adore and a very likeable plot.the game out of order.

B00770KR7W|5.0|I must say, this is one of McFarlane Toy's better Halo figures.<br /><br />Pros: Very good articulation. Awesome paint job (loved the reflective paint on the visor). The armor on the figure is not just molded into the figure, the armor was added after they had completed it, which was really neat. And the weapon is just great, which features a removable peg this time!<br /><br />Cons: Cheif's head can't look straight up, but that should be expected because of the bulkiness of the figure. His spartan ID (117) is nowhere to be found. Mine came with the foot rubber ripped, but I hope this problem is only with mine. His hip is on an awesome ball joint, but the problem with ball-jointed hips is that it is pretty hard to pose them in certain positions (like crouching). Aside from those, this is an epic figure!<br /><br />Like is said, this is one of McFarlane Toy's better figures.  I'd give it a 10.5/10.<br /><br />For those who can't get the AR in is hand, just push the grip under his thumb then push it forward, works great for me.
B002NJUN44|4.0|The 4 book series , movie and guide book were a purchase for  a 25 yr. old male who is familiar with the series. I paged through the guide book when it arrived, and it looks interesting. The price was right too.

1451695195|4.0|I was born into a mostly Christian family, however my mother was indifferent and my father was an avowed Atheist.  So that confused me a little.  I have always wanted fervently to believe in an afterlife, but the thought of being greeted by St. Peter, passing through a giant gate encrusted with pearls, and then standing on a street paved with gold, singing worship songs praising God for 867 trillion years, then a while, quite frankly had always frightened me!! ( Wow, talk about a &#34;run on sentence!&#34;)<br /><br />Searching for the truth in my lifetime; I'm 66, has been mostly exasperating, and Heaven as most of us hear, or read it described is a difficult concept for me and countless others.  I've read something about every world religion and philosophy, from Atheism, Buddhism, to Pantheism, and much much more, not to mention my personal favorite, the King James Bible.  The truth is elusive.<br /><br />This book was written by a Scientist, and Harvard Academician, Brain Surgeon.  Being somewhat of a 'skeptic' to say the least had caused me to just stop considering an afterlife, though I have read many NDE accounts in scores of books; Supposedly &#34;factual.&#34;  Dr. Raymond Moody had me nearly convinced early on in life, especially with 'Life After Life.'  However I remained a &#34;skeptic&#34; after some time had passed after having read his book and many similar books.<br /><br />In the interest of brevity, I shall get to the point!  If you really want to believe in Heaven, but have some lingering doubts, this book will convince you!  I highly recommend it, above all others of that genre, if you are so inclined.  That's how great it is, in my ever-so-humble opinion!<br /><br />Read it!  I devoured it!
B00943SQCI|5.0|Good humor about waking up in the 1960's after life in the 1800's. A place where hippies relate to pilgrims.

B007HACDLK|5.0|It is a twist and turn don't put it down book! It has more twists and turns than any previous Mitch Rapp books. Vince Flynn has done it again. There are no weak pages and each page makes you read further. I can NOT wait for the next chapter in the characters next assignment.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Amazing movie.  If you dislike UV, stop crying and rip your own digital copy.  Taking one star off would be reasonable, but giving the overall product a 1 star rating because of whining about the UV copy is very lame since the movie is good and you still have Blu Ray and DVD.

B00AA7O22U|5.0|We like this movie very much. However to have to review every movie we rent from Amazon is a pain! The stars should be enough. I'm not a movie critic.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|this is a Christmas gift for my grandson.  He loves animals and watches clips of this movie on utube everyday.
B006T5C5PS|5.0|This diet is not for everyone it's very restrictive. However the claims made by the people that run the clinic are nothing short of miraculous. My question is if it works so well, why is it illegal in the United States? They answer that question to some degree in the book.
B0062NAVXA|5.0|This was a terrific movie, heartbreaking at times but very uplifting movie by the end.  This movie was a great follow-up to Fireproof!!

B002VRZEYM|5.0|This movie presents extremely worth while information about the food industry here in the United States. Granted it mostly only shows the negative side, and I believe there are positives, but it is certainly information that everyone should know and understand. This despite how much the \\"mainstream\\" tries to discredit it. Definitely a must see!

B008O9V4C2|3.0|I am a huge fan of Donald Fagan and Steely Dan.  I have to say that this album sounds like he just phoned it in. Nothing &#34;grabs&#34; me about this album at all. I have listened to it about 10 times now and it still does nothing for me. Now Kamikirad was a different story................
B007HACDLK|4.0|The book follows the same line of actions from all previous Rapp's novels, which kind of make it predictable. The bad guys will suffer after leadig all action in almost half of the story but than Mitch falls back into his operational &#34;mood&#34; and they will all be punished!
B0084I9QLY|5.0|How can you rate this.  It's a classic, do do so would be Bad.  My favorite song is Dirty Diana.

B006LSZECO|3.0|This book left me wondering.  Don't know if that is good or bad.  The only compliant I have is that the author did not have to use the \\"f\\" word on every page.  Overall the author has created a very interesting story.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|this is my favorite christmas comedy. the laughs never stop, but the underlying message also comes through loud and clear. great casting also.

B008NEMN0K|4.0|Ok,lets say your a fan of this really good Will Smith movie,you've seen it on regular dvd and liked it.You own 3D equipment,then I do recommend that you buy the blu-ray 3D version because it does enhance the movie and make it more visual and enjoyable. 2nd reason,if you've never seen this really good movie,own 3D equipment,then yeah,buy it.  I will say that the other 3D reviews like the one by CLDSK are pretty right on.Its a transfer,it wasn't filmed in 3D,so there are very few pop-outs and booming 3D.I kind of compare the 3D to putting in a regular blu-ray disk,turning on the 3D function on your remote,and putting on your glasses,except that its twice that good.In other words it enhances the film.I've seen worse 3d transfers and because I really enjoy this futuristic sci-fi visual Will Smith thriller Im glad I purchased the blu-ray 3D version.
B002FOQY2M|5.0|Great album! I got Some Nights first and enjoyed it so much I had to get their first album and wasn't disappointed! Some highlights for me from the album are - The Gambler, All the Pretty Girls and Take your Time. I would highly recommend this album if you liked Some Nights!
B002OSXDAU|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. Ayn Rand clearly shows why the individual and his own pursuit of happiness is the keystone of a free and prosperous society.

0553382179|5.0|If you are going in circles trying to figure out where to start or how to get motivated, the FlyLady will help.. I was skeptical because all articles/books I have read only tell you how to do what &#34;normal&#34; people do.  FlyLady followers don't think that way.  She breaks things down to help you take that first scary step.  She makes things doable to the overwhelmed and under-motivated.  She helps you not look at everything at once.  When you can do that, you can begin to tackle your clutter and dirt over time and keep it that way.  Don't hesitate to try her method.  It is simple and humorous and a good read.  She's just like us!
B004GXZ69W|5.0|The mouse fits my hand perfectly!  While it does take some getting used to, it sure does help my wrist/hand problems and I've recommended it to a couple others here at work.
B008VBYN80|4.0|I'm on level 30, I been playing for quite some time. its a fun game until you go far enough into the story and then you will see 1st hand you need $$$ to actually upgrade your soldiers to the fullest.<br /><br /> when you get to level 20 and up it gets pretty hard to beat people online if your trying to play this game without using real $$$.<br /><br /> its a great game if you put real $$$$ into this game. plain and simple!!!!!
1449410243|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my boyfriend who has two cats and we were falling on the floor laughing! The book is also very sturdy. High quality and such a fun, silly gift.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Stray Souls was fun to play. I had no trouble loading it on to my Kindle. Hidden object games were not to difficult but not to easy either. Would recommend this game if your looking for something not to hard.
B0096CDG0O|1.0|I downloaded and installed this game and then promptly removed it! No game should require your email to just play!
B000VJAICK|1.0|in any player... all my players are fine and other dvds work. I wonder if I was sent one for the correct region.
1936608898|5.0|I didn't buy this book from Amazon, because I just couldn't wait for it! I went to Barnes and Noble and bought it full price...and it was well worth it! I knew that this book had something special in it when I found it. It's a great read, easy to understand, and fun. It makes the whole30 a little more simple. I don't have to calculate anything. It's not a \\"diet\\". This book got me started on a new path and I now have a new relationship with food. I don't look at food the same anymore! (that's a side effect of this book). I believe knowledge is power and this book gave me that. My lifestyle has changed and for the best. I have also craved more information about the Paleo lifestyle and a healthy lifestyle. I am now reading more information and diving into new ways of cooking! I have enjoyed this! So I would recommend anyone to read this book, even if you are not planning on eating a Paleo diet. It gives you information to make an educated choice.
B005LAII0I|5.0|Fun, campy, Bollywood dance scene...I found it fun but the person for whom I bought knew what she wanted and loves this movie.  The seven dwarves kind of steal the show but that's okay.  Julia Roberts does a great job.  Some nice effects but no major twists on the original story.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Did not disappoint. As usual kept you guessing until the last page. Highly recommend to those who like fast moving plot with a limited number of characters.
B005VPRET4|5.0|I got this for a not so young Lego addict in my life.  Are you ever too old for Legos?  Heck no!  Yet another success for Legos.  They keep doing what they do well and they do it right.  If it isn't broken don't fix it.
B002BCNK1Q|4.0|Great movie with a great actor. Again this was an assignment and it helped tremendously. The movie depicts Asian American, Mexicans, and African Americans in the same light as gang members.
B005KJZDXK|5.0|if you like she and him and the lyrical music they play, its a great christmas album of many of the standard hits.  i love the style so i love this.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn can't write fast enough for me. Enjoy following Mitch Rapp and the characters continue to develop; great twists and turns.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham's best work in years. Having read most of Grisham's books, I can honestly say that he is back. Page turner.
B004V5A7K8|3.0|It was a blast from the past and a return to my childhood, but the levels didn't seem to really change, and it takes forever for it to get harder.
1451620829|5.0|Ok,<br /><br />I've been waiting for a while to read this book since Peter's been pushing releasing a book for years. I read Ace's book and still didn't feel like I had enough. Peter's book was awesome. A lot of reviews say that Peter plays the \\"woe is me\\" card a lot, but I think he's just telling what happened through his eyes. He does take responsibility through out the entire book for a lot of his mistakes. Plus we've all heard the stories about Gene and Paul being control freaks and well, we shouldn't be surprised when we read it in Peter's book. Peter did give a lot of \\"stories\\" that I enjoyed. Particularly stories about Paul's sexuality and Peter really talked about the abundance of women back in those days. In this book, no one is safe! I suggest every KISS fan buy the book, you won't be disappointed!
B0076DEJMO|4.0|I love Joe Abercrombie.  I've never met him, but I love his writing.  He somehow marries into every cliche of the fantasy genre, but turns it on it ear and makes it fresh and new while also poking some fun at it.  This adventure brings back an old favorite from the Law series.  The adventure is everything you could want it to be: fast, fun, bloody, horrific, entertaining and comical.  But at the very end Abercrombie promises a confrontation that would have been epic, but then he chickens out.  Apparently Mr. Abercrombie doesn't want to kill off one of his two most interesting characters.  I guess I can't blame him.  But if you aren't going to go through with it, why tease it so mercilessly? Overall a great read and a fun time.
1451627289|5.0|Loved this book!!!!  Never wanted to put it down!  Nice change to King's normal gruesome scary horror novels!<br /><br />What an imagination this man has!!!
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Only pulls up 3 new posts. does not update on it's own and honestly ot just plain needs to be redone.  Uninstalled!  Please fix!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|If you are a fan of zombie movies you will love this show. The characters seem to be real and are easy to relate to.
B008CLI4N4|1.0|There are some spoilers here, for those of you that don't want to read on i will just leave you with a short summary. If you don't mind a series where the most brutal and humiliating of acts or deaths can occur to characters you identify with, a series were evil triumphs always over good and justice, or basically just a unrewarding depressing experience, then this series is for you.<br /><br />Going more in detail....<br /><br />This series is the most bitter, anti-climatic and disappointing i've ever had the chance to see. In truth the actual directors or actors are not to blame but more the source material in the form of George R Martin, who seems to enjoy taking any character who dares to stand for honor and justice, and destroying them in the most humiliating and heart breaking of ways, and any hope of a righteous resolution to the given situation along with it.<br /><br />I know, the martin fans are gonna start coming out of the woodwork with flamethrowers in hand to burn me in effigy, because what i really need to be watching is beauty and the beast or some other movie or cartoon you will sarcastically concoct, you can save yourselves the trouble, because what you probably won't acknowledge is that this entire series was marketed around Sean Bean, and it's mainly the reason i started watching it, like many other people did, so his disturbing and humiliating death is nothing but a cheap TV version of a bait and switch. This is one of the tasteless and ridiculous events of this TV series, and it's something that plagues the book series as a whole, because again, the author has a tragedy prone sense of writing, specially when it comes to the \\"just\\" characters in his books, that one might think he's had some childhood trauma of sorts that he is venting through these books, that he feels a need for evil to triumph consistently.<br /><br />Some other reviewer stated how it's concerning that people seem to enjoy this sort of story so much, prone to brutally tragic senseless events befalling the most likable characters of this series, and i think it really is a valid point, and it's a symptom of how people in recent times seem to sadly enjoy more carnage and senseless violence than they used to, some people like seeing dogs or cats being killed in brutal ways, is it a valid argument for entertainment value? i probably wouldn't agree.<br /><br />Others argue that the fact noone is safe, and any tragedy can befall anyone, makes it more like real like and that is awesome. If i wanted a dosage of real life i'd stick with CNN and with the wars in the middle east, for fiction and fantasy i expect a little more direction and purpose. The problem here is not only that characters die, is that they die in the most brutal and humiliating of ways, and their deaths have no meaning whatsoever, who the hell can enjoy heroes being destroyed over and over? it borders on sado-masochism.<br /><br />The funny thing is that the author, in his \\"kill everything in sight\\" mentality, has actually fallen into a predictable and hypocritical writing style, because by now people know who will die before hand and at the same time i think people know who he prefers not to touch. I dare him to kill the dragon queen, yet probably every ready knows, even he himself knows, that if he were to kill her at the current point the series is in, everybody would probably stop reading it, so in a sense he's not true to his \\"anyone can die\\" mentality, he very \\"carefully\\" applies it.<br /><br />For those of you that enjoy that sort of thing, do enjoy.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|If anyone likes horror they will love this show. The plot is out of this world. There is alot going on in every episode so make sure you pay attention.
B005NJU8PA|4.0|The structure of the book is sometimes difficult to follow, but still it is fun to read - as the writer said: do not read it from the beginning to the end... Everyone can find some parts not only interesting, but worth considering and follow up.
B008NW67E0|5.0|This cd is superb.  After a few listens I really starting catching on to a few songs and now I can't take the disk out of my car.  There  are a few more laid back pieces on this cd compared to their first, and I find myself liking these more than their higher energy pieces.  There is an emotional attachment to this cd that keeps bringing me back.  Great stuff Mumford!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I didn't want to put the book down.  Not your typical Stephen King thriller.  I really enjoyed this book with all of its twists and turns.  Really makes you think about life and how much balances on decisions we make throughout our lives.
1582406723|5.0|Excellent comic! This is a prime example of when art and story combine to make a truly wonderful reading experience.

0312330855|4.0|All the stories are great. Some make you laugh and some cry. The only complaint, and a very very small one, is that some stories are repeated, but they are all worth reading again.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I picked this rating because it was a great book I loved everything about it can't wait to read part two I recommend all my friends read it

B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Great story - great action! So entertaining - the time went so fast! Anne Hathaway was fantastic! Interesting drama and storyline!
0307341550|5.0|This first person narration has lots of interesting twists and turns, fine descriptions, and may seem to be a bit misogynist, but then the young (and nice-looking)author has a really peculiar imagination; not to mention a fine command of the language!  A slow concentrated read shows that all the pieces fit right in, and though the ending was not a total surprise to this hardened mystery critic, it was even more unusual than I could have predicted. Even such standard set pieces like a dollhouse are put in this book for a reason, and so it goes throughout. After finishing it, the postcript was one for the ages; this author has a real sense of humor as well. Though in truth, most of the events in this book, though bizarre at times, are anything but humorous. This is one of those new and young authors with a really unique style, far-out imagination, who is not afraid to dwell in and reveal certain aspects of our species we'd rather ignore!

B004FPZ2LI|4.0|I find the illustrations slightly disappointing so I deducted one star. Apart from that Jane Austen remains my all time favourite author.

B0015RFCZ0|4.0|I am an educator, and my middle school students love this modern example of fantasy.  The ending makes us all happy, and we found ourselves routing for August the whole film.

0061537969|5.0|I don't read a lot because I lose interest easily. I picked up this book at the airport because I needed something to occupy me. I read it in one day and I've never done that before. I have 2 dogs and this book really hit home for me. The story is told by the main character's dog, Enzo. The writing of this book reassured me that dogs are almost people and they have their own experiences, memories, and emotions. I'm buying this again and giving it to my girlfriend. One of my favorite books I've ever read. If you like dogs or animals in general, give it a shot. I couldn't put it down, even while standing in line for my flight.

B007FEFLTO|2.0|This book, like Fall of Giants, is intersting from an historicak perspective, but the sentence structure and dialog is stilted and unreal.  Poorly edited, too.

B003ZSI7R2|5.0|It's an absolute human impossibility to not rapidly move at least one body part or another when these guys are playing--check out the sample for Pelvis Pusher (mysteriously and incomprehensibly mp3 only), and you'll have everything moving at once! I'll warn you now: Don't ever have the good china out when you play this album!<br /><br />Saw them on Letterman, and they were a knockout. I couldn't take my eyes off them, and that's quite an achievement for Vintage Trouble. As usual, VT, being the show's musical guest, was the final guest of the night. For those of you not familiar with Letterman's show, it always ends when the musical act finishes and Letterman comes over, shakes some hands and waves to the camera and says goodnight, and then Paul Schaffer and the studio band play the theme out under the ending credits. After VT however, Letterman loved them so much he had them reprise a few bars to play the show out instead of Paul and the band, something I've never seen Letterman do before. Nobody ever gets an encore, but Vintage Trouble did!<br /><br />I'm fascinated by their mix of rock, blues and soul that they do so seamlessly. And for the most part, they dress like they might have just gotten off the same plane John, Paul, George and Ringo flew over on for their first trip across the pond. Great to listen to, and great visual entertainment, too, if you get the chance to see them!<br /><br />I don't think anyone who likes blues based or R&B based rock & roll could go wrong with this album.

B0093H8HXS|5.0|I was looking for a low power CPU and that's what I got it the amd are pretty attractive on terms of speed but they are much more watts than this one.. my previous core2 cpu was heating up.. this one is much faster and it does make any differences in terms of heat. It has hyper threading so you can see 4 cpu to buy an i5 i think is wasting of money.

B000JBWWRY|5.0|No matter how many times you watch this movie, it never gets old. Its just a classic. Everyone loves Peter Pan. Also, if you go to Disneyland the line to get on this ride is one of the longest. Everyone always wishes they could fly, go to Neverland and have a dog for a babysitter. It the fun part of believing and never growing old.
0060873175|5.0|So I've read a lot of people saying the book is disturbing, or they don't like the novel. Personally I loved it. I guess it takes an open mind to actually realize the book is amazing. I am a slightly disturbed person myself so I found myself lost in the book. I am a 16 year old girl and oddly enough this book gripped me. I love horror novels but this was different. In my personal opinion people might not have liked the book do to the fact its based on science. Thats what made it all the more disturbing to me. Science is always changing and what if this \\"micro world\\" really can become possible. What if science develops enough for this to happen? Disturbing, yes. Bad book? That I leave to you. I think the book is amazing just do to the fact if science can continue on the track it is now this spin chilling, mind blowing novel COULD actally became a reality. THAT alone makes the book magnificent.
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|Whitney's voice and songs are timeless. When you hear a song from an earlier record it just sends you back in time to when you first listened to it. The song collection on the album is terrific. I wish One Moment in Time was on this album though.  I guess you can't have it all. The only thing that is tragic is that you can tell in the last few songs that her voice wasn't what it used to be. Even though she still has a beautiful voice you can hear the rasp of her harder times in life.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|I wasn't sure after reading Bared to You if I was going to continue on with this series. I kinda had enough with the billionaire man and a tragic love story. But I have been reading a lot of Urban Fantasy with no real sex and I was crazing some and figured this book would give me what I wanted. And it really did.<br /><br /> I have to say I like this second book so much more. I had read 50 Shades not to long before reading Bared to You and they just where to similar for me, but Reflected in You really made this book its own story. I wasn't having any real comparison moments and was just wrapped up in the story.<br /><br />I do have a few complaints in the beginning. There was a lot going on and Gideon was totally keeping too many secrets. His ex fiance shows up at his work and leaves looking like she just got screwed, then he leaves in the middle of the night, there were pictures of him and his ex out to dinner and Eva let him off way too easy. She just let him pretty much dodge answers by him screwing her brains out. I was not satisfied, I would have totally put a gun up to my significant other and got answers or walked out and never looked back. I didn't like how when issues came up they had sex and just let it all go.<br /><br />But I did enjoy the story. Towards the end a big twist happened and there was this mystery I just had to figure out. I knew there was more then what we were seeing and I had to get my answers. Plus we finally got to know some of Gideon's darkest secrets and why he was doing the things he did in this book.<br /><br />I won't lie some of it was hard to read, because my heart was breaking. But the last 40% of the story sucked me in and now I can not wait for book 3! If you read book 1 and liked it then you should check out this book because I think its a lot better.  I am really glad I didn't quit this series.
B00646UU5Y|5.0|Just so much for a geek to love here.  It was so much fun watching this series. I just loved it.
B0053O89WY|5.0|My husband loved his early Christmas gift.  He uses this show while teaching his high school physics class.  The students love it.
B0098VYCCE|2.0|If you're hoping for an interesting and somewhat faithful adaptation of the classic Grimm's fairy tale Snow White, don't look to this movie for it. This piece is good for special effects you may not have seen before, but not great at story telling. Even though some of the acting is quite good, (and some quite bad), the movie suffers from a terrible script. It was hard to watch all the way to the end because the writing was such drivel.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Love this book. It has all the elements action,adventure, and a little romance. Read all the books in the series!
B009CPJHY4|4.0|I love the ongoing message: Everything will be okay in the end. If it is not okay, it is not the end.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|This is an easy book to read.  It is a modern allegory with strong religious themes.  Overall, a book similar to Mitch Alboms previous titles but doesn't reach the level of \\"Tuesdays with Morrie\\".
B00A93ENX8|1.0|Update July 2. 2014:<br />I JUST contacted Kevin Shirley, the original recording engineer for Counterparts. He confirmed what I had discovered earlier, that it was recorded on a Studer 48 track digital recorder at 16 bit / 48kHz. They had just recently changed over from the Sony digital recorder they previously used.<br />Rush's earlier recordings at Le Studio were recorded on a Sony Digital 24 track PC-3324 at 16 bit/44.1kHz, or a Mitsubishi X-8oo digital 32 track (16bit/44.1kHz).<br /><br />All they can do with Rush's recordings is play with the dynamics, there is nothing that they can do to change the low-resolution of the original 80s through mid-90s Rush recordings.<br /><br />To make a true SACD you need to use an analog source. If you use any digital source all you get on an SACD is a clear copy of that low-resolution recording.<br /><br />All of Rush's LPs from 1981/82 were low resolution digital. They would record everything at 16 bit/44.1kHz except the bass and drums which they would record on analog tape at a different studio. Although those analog recordings were later converted to digital (which is counter productive). May as was have skipped the analog recording.<br /><br />Around 1991/92 when DAT mastering was more widely utilized, they were recording in low-res still but mastering at 20 bit / 48kHz.<br />24 bit recording was not widely used until the late 90s, the first commercial rock 24 bit recording was in 1996. So there ARE no recordings of Rush from the 80s through the 90s that are truly high quality (analog or high-definition).<br /><br />So, making am SACD from a low-resolution source is ridiculous because all you get in the end is a VERY clear copy of a CD!! The original recordings resolution can never be changed. Ever.<br />You could do the EXACT same thing by using the CD and play with the dynamics yourself and copy it to 24/96kHz or higher if you have the software.
0756407125|5.0|Tthis story is so good that I find myself thinking about it at odd times even now that I've finished it. I am trying to wait patiently for the next book, but it is hard. I wonder what Kvothe is doing and if Denna has left again. And what's up with Bast? These are only some of the questions I have and hope that Mr. Rothfuss will soon answer them. If you love fantasy but have gotten a little bored with the same formula, please try &#34;the Name of the Wind&#34; and &#34;the Wise Man's Fear, I promise you won't be disappointed!

B007Q0OV6Q|2.0|Maybe we had the wrong idea in thinking that an Advent Calenar should have something to do with Christmas.  Nothing \\"Christmasy\\" about it so far.  We've purchased the City versions the past several years and really enjoyed them.  Love Legos but totally disappointed with this particular product.
B005GG0MIS|5.0|Great resource with historical accounts of the Presidents and their interactions. More importantly, the insights derived provide information to support and/or explain current practices and policies.

B0062NAX1U|5.0|My husband and I watched this movie today for the first time and it had us both in tears one minute and laughing the next. The world needs more movies like this, because it is so very true to life and raising your children. Being there for them, doing things with them and showing your family how much you really love them. Time goes by so fast and our children grow up, so we have to take the opportunities with them when they arrise...for you don't know what tomorrow may bring.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|I usually love Patricia Cornwell's books but this one just never hit stride for me. Had I nor paid for this book I would have never made it through it. The well established main character seemed out of her element most of the time and seemed lost in very conflicted feelings and emotions.  Way too much detail was written that just seemed like page filler having very little to nothing to do wit the excruciating slow development of the story.  All and all I was just glad to finish reading.
B00846TTDG|4.0|Very good except you can imagine from the beginning what characters are likely not going to make it. If you like these movies and you are  a patriotic American you will enjoy this and if you don't already, you'll probably be more willing to thank a service member or Veteran on the street.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|As with most of Grisham's books this one was a great read. The story line was well developed and grabbed me from the first chapter.
B009B0L324|4.0|Five stars if this had been recorded 15-20 years ago.  But even so, they still sound very solid and are very entertaining!  All the great hits are here.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Book Two of the trilogy is just as interesting as Book One. The characters are believable and engaging... it's interesting to see how the next generation deals with World War II in contrast to how their parents dealt with World War I in Book One. Can't wait for Book 3!

B001H1UQRI|5.0|Brilliantly shot, excellently acted, and wonderfully twisted. This movie takes you on a gritty and surreal journey of a man's self-discovery. Visceral, thought-provoking, and insane. I love this movie!!!

B008Z9YLV2|2.0|A futuristic, orderly, but sick society.<br /><br />THX-1138, Rollerball, and about 50 episodes of the Twilight Zone did it better. Far better. Part of it was the cast. I didn't like any of them except maybe the girl, and just when I realized this, Woody Harrelson walks in. But I pressed on, for about 5 more minutes. I probably would have liked Donald Sutherland, but I turned it off before he had said much of anything.<br /><br />I think if Sandra Bullock and Keanu Reeves had a child, that child could not grow up to be as bad at acting as the lady in pink.<br /><br />Not the best review, but I've watched a lot of movies lately and this is the only one I turned off.<br /><br />Update: I decided to watch the rest the next day while cleaning up my computers' file system. It was less unbearable because my expectations were so low and I was only half watching. I don't see how anyone who's seen [[ASIN:B002WCFT0K Rollerball (1975)]], [[ASIN:B000P3GFWO THX 1138]], or [[ASIN:B001QUM4IY Soylent Green]] could think this movie was good.
B004FEFS5E|5.0|If you are new to photography or want a brush up/fine tune, this book is a wealth of information.<br /><br />It is very comprehensive compared to many photography books out there today and Mr. Peterson is clearly passionate about his work and also gives great exercises to do on your own to help you critique your own photos

B003YL4LYI|4.0|As this was a part 2 from the book 4, I had a bit of difficulty with the time line.  They were happening at the same time, but it was hard to keep the Kings Landing time line in connection with book 5, But I must say I CANNOT WAIT for the next book to come out.  What is the outcome of Jon, what's happening with Bran, will Danerys save the day?  This is what I love about his books, they keep you on the edge of your seat, and wanting for more.  I have never read a book that long and still wanted more.  Keep up the GREAT work, I will be a loyal fan forever.
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This is definitely at the top of the list for Christmas movies, especially when it comes to my kids. Personally, I love the older movies that I grew up with about 30 years ago, and even those before then, but for a modern day movie, this one ranks high among the younger generation.  The graphics are very realistic and pretty neat.  I will say that it leans on the darker side a little and some characters and/or scenes may be too scary for certain children.  It just depends on the kid.  If your young child(ren) are only used to happy, calm characters, this movie may be too intense for them...for example, the conductor comes across pretty harsh and angry most of the time and another one of the characters appears to be a ghost and is a little creepy at times.  The whole film takes place at night, so it's mostly dark, too.  All in all, it's a great movie though!

B005K0HDGE|4.0|It's obvious from reading this that Mr. King did his research on Lee Harvey Oswald.  Mix in the allure/mystery of time travel and its consequences with one of the most polarizing events of the 20th century and you've got the plot line.  Interesting to think about the time leading up to the assassination and what type of person does such a thing...

0316228532|3.0|I will be the first to admit that when a book does not hit me as either good or bad, I have a hard time writing about it. I am sorry, but this will be a very dull uninspiring review. I cannot help it, that is how the book left me.<br /><br />When I first picked up this book, I did not understand what all the fuss way about. How could so many people dislike a book just because the author branched out and wrote something different? From time to time, authors need to explore other storylines. I have no problem with that - loved when Grisham writes books other than legal thrillers. However, for some to find the need to compare everything to Potter was just ludicrous.<br /><br />The first hundred pages were mostly character development; I must confess that I had to do an internet search to keep them all straight. Still not understanding the dislike by many, since I like British mysteries and found this book to start out the same way, I trudged on.<br /><br />Then I got to page 200'ish. Dang this story is not moving. OK, maybe it is me. Then page 300 and 400. Darn it. I had such high hopes for this book. It was not until page 400'ish of 500'ish that I actually enjoyed what was being told. Sorry, but that is too late for anyone.<br /><br />Even after finishing the book, I will not say that is was horrible, just wanted more mystery or suspense I guess. Nowhere was this book billed as a mystery, but for some reason that is what I had in my mind. As I said before - it was me developing a preconceived notion as to what this book was about.<br /><br />Billed as a tragicomedy, the novel is set in a suburban town called Pagford and begins with the unexpected death of Barry Fairbrother. With Barry's death, there is an open seat on the council up for grabs. What ensues is an all-out war amongst the people of Pagford even before an election can be held for his successor.<br /><br />For such a small town, this place is full of secrets and when they suddenly come to the surface in blog postings, no one is safe. Class wars and social issues are the running theme in this book. There are sections that are laugh out loud funny and other sections that are downright cringe worthy.<br /><br />If you are a fan of epics, which I just might think that was designed to be, take a chance. There is definitely a love it or loath it debate surrounding this book.<br /><br />As a side note, I just read this morning that BBC will be turning this book into a series. It is expected to air in Britain in 2014, but with no immediate plans to bring it to the US.g postings, no one is safe. Class wars and social issues are the running theme in this book.

0307719219|5.0|Why Nations Fail describes the facinating intersection of history, politics and economics.  Authors Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson craft a readable work that traces the development human civilization from the Ice Age to the present in the context of politics and economics.  They clearly argue why certain nations succeed while others fail centered on the establishment of free markets and pluralistic societies.  The authors also show that although failed states eventually disappear, these extractive societies can nevertheless survive for decades, even centuries, for the benefit of an elite few at the expense of many.  Although written by professors from MIT and Harvard, this book is well written and thankfully lacks arcane academic writing that sometimes permeates works like this one.  There are a number of good books on history, on politics and on economics - Why Nations Fail is one of the best books written that covers all three topics.

B0083EY9EI|5.0|So glad I purchased this album. Sande is very underrated. This album has a little bit of everything. Her voice is absolutely phenomenal!! Great music to relax to w/ a few upbeat tracks.
B008LZHA3G|3.0|I haven't listened to the entire CD yet. i just downloaded \\"Duquesne Whistle\\" and it is a really fun, energetic, and has an exciting feel to it! It has a very fast beat (like 3 beats/second) so it has a nice, quick pace and the song uses a standing bass (the old wooden, standing, string bass that is plucked - not a modern electric bass guitar). The standing bass and drums provide a nice rhythm for the song. Dylan's voice is really hoarse and raw these days (I haven't listened to anything from Dylan since college days and that was a long time ago). There's something about this song that is just infectious and makes me want to dance and jump around. I like that! I just can't stop listening to that song! I want to stay up all night and listen to it over and over and over!<br /><br />I have listened to part of \\"Early Roman Kings\\" and about all I can say is to listen to Muddy Waters' \\"Mannish Boy\\" then listen to \\"Early Roman Kings\\". Hear any similarities? \\"Early Roman Kings\\" is essentially a new set of lyrics to to the tune of Muddy Waters' \\"Mannish Boy\\". It seems strange to hear \\"Dylan plays Muddy Waters\\"!<br /><br />I give this CD three stars only because I'm so excited by the title song but not very fond of the rest of what I've heard so far. I'm neither a Dylan fan nor a Dylan hater. I have no opinion on Dylan himself or his musical history, so I'm just writing this review like any other CD. If you want to know about lyrics (I've never been able to fully understand lyrics in music since I was kid - I guess I pay more attention to the music and not enough attention to the lyrics) or you want to know how this compares to other Dylan efforts, you will want to read reviews by others.<br /><br />BTW, so far this seems to be reasonable well recorded for a modern CD. From what I can see on Audacity, the waveform looks like a serious victim of \\"the loudness wars\\", listening to the title song on my system doesn't turn up any nasty distortion or anything. Lacking in dynamics,yes, compared to some classical CDs I have but for modern pop music it's about par for the course. In the end, it seems quite listenable.
B00005R1N3|5.0|Do not let the PG rating fool you Black Christmas is way more scarier than many of these gore films out there. Suspence is used instead of nasty gore fx.

0345803485|5.0|English is a foreign language for me, and even I think the writing is plain and get irritated with the repetitious words and phrases, but I still love the dream situation of being the one person who matters to an irresistibly gorgeous man.<br /><br />I enjoy the events and episodes describing the hero's disturbing possessiveness. Makes me remember the long forgotten feeling of being the object of passionate love/crush when I was a young woman, 20 years back...! I've read the book three times already and still come back to re-live the feeling.<br /><br />I'm such a loser but after a rough day at work, it's like coming home to a warm and intimate embrace of a lover. Beats chocolates.<br /><br />The first book is the best. I've skimmed through the other two books (gets cheesier and shallower, and I hate Ana's attitude at work...), and prefer to believe the story concluded with book one.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Great book! Read in a few days, I couldn't put it down! Plan on reading more by Gillian Flynn but not immediately... book was graphic and morbid. My next book needs to be “lighter“.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|This is a must have app for android phone users who love to read!  I can't always carry a paperback book with me, but I always have my phone in my pocket.  When I'm at work on break, or lunch instead of surfing the net for news, or scrolling through my Facebook posts, I can relax and enjoy a good book!  I've not found anything about the app that I don't like!  It works just as I expect it to.  No surprises for me!  Highly recommended!

She represents a part of all of us as women, he represents all the parts women want from a man.  He's rich, but that's just a means to an end.  Reading this book (s) will show on your face.  It's hot!  (not recommended for anyone with a pace maker  lol) Since reading it, all I have to do is look at the tie, and my breathing shallows, heart beats a little faster and I'm sure my eyes dialate.  Enjoy, and &#34;Laters, Baby!&#34;

B0041KVW2K|1.0|I returned one set already and I am ready to return this one too, I just want to get a playable set, but I am wondering if it is possible.  I have not listened to the entire set yet, and already terribly disappointed.<br /><br />The system i use to listen to is above average,  well tuned and sensitive enough to distortion,  I have a Well Tempered Classic turntable with a recently re-tipped (By SoundSmith) WIN SMC-10 cartridge, the speakers are Soundlab A1 electrostatics.  I get clean play on most of my 3500 plus records, even the old used copies of the few US pressings of the Beatles sound better than what i had in experienced on some of the songs on the box sets.<br /><br />So here we go Amazon, please let EMI know this is just not good.<br /><br />dee<br />;-D

B0012CH350|5.0|It doesn't have a cinch string at the bottom, which I thought was a little weird.  But I believe it keeps moisture off the kettle, gives it room to breath.  I've had it blow off once in a couple of bad wind storms.  But overall it's been a very reliable cover.  We'll see after a few years of abuse how it lasts.

B0096CDG0O|1.0|Who in their right mind is going to download a game (free or not) that is asking for so many unnecessary and unneeded permissions that are not explained? Certainly not I.
B00457X7XQ|4.0|Scary story that is probably going to happen at some point by some means.<br /><br />I personally don't think that this particular scenario is extremely likely, but I have been wrong before...<br /><br />The book itself is quite good but the story was not as engaging as it could have been. I think the character development was good, but lacked some dimensionality beyond the main characters being computer security experts.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|Not my favorite Albom book, but certainly worth a read if you like his stuff.  A bit over wrought, but it does hold the attention.
0547884591|5.0|My mother-in law is both a school teacher, she teaches french, and a great cook. With this book I get to feed both her obsessions, and ensure that I continue to get great Sunday dinners!
0385335989|5.0|The story stands alone but is made even better if you read all of the books in order. I have come to love these characters and will be sad when the story ends. Excellent writing and accurate history.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Another good  one from DeMille.  As usual plenty of humor from the main character, John Corey, to go with the tension of his current assignment  - in Yemen.  He's searching for the elusive Al Qaida terrorist, The Panther.  The man responsible for the Cole bombing<br />Very enjoyable  read!
0812993357|1.0|Easy review.... Part 1  blah, blah, blah... I was beautiful, I got married way too many times, I know every model's name (I am so cool). Part 2 - kiss, kiss, kisses to Anna. She is so wonderful!<br />oy vey!!!! Thought this would fun and interesting. NOT!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|In the last two Scarpetta novels I have read,  (&#34;The Bone Bed&#34; and &#34;The Body Farm&#34;), Ms. Cornwell has turned what I consider to be a peripheral character into the primary villain. I spent most of both books trying to figure out who &#34;done it,&#34; only to have it be someone whose role in the narrative was relatively minor. I've read MOST of the Scarpetta novels, but I think I'll give them a &#34;break&#34; for a while. Maybe Ms. Cornwell and Kay Scarpetta need to re-charge their batteries.
B000IMUYJM|4.0|Modern horror films often involved a lot of suffering, but they do not satisfy. A movie like Black Christmas leaves more to the imagination, with mystery and terror and suspense involved.  The cast makes you believe their fear and conflict as they deal with a stalker/killer hiding out in the sorority house where some of them are staying for the hoiday season.  Creepy atmosphere!
B0084U0IEG|3.0|Wonderful prose, and excellent plot, although with occasional plagiarism: (spanish film &#34;No es bueno que el hombre este solo&#34;), but if you are not born in Britain, or you are not familiar  with british culture and its unspokent codes, some of the charm of the book may be lost.<br />It is a pity that such a good author like Ian McEwan does not write books with  for a more universal world.
B0083SBJXS|4.0|Nothing else tahn that.<br />Excellent packaging but the movie get me bored some times. Honestly, not bad, but wayyyyyy too long.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This review contains some spoilers.<br /> To start, I do think this book was a little overrated. Like many others, I didn't really like the ending. I thought the last fifth of the book could have been more developed. I didn't care foe the character Desi. I thought he seamed more like a caricature than a real believable person. I did like the irony of how &#34;he helped her&#34;.  The book had many redeeming qualities too. There was a quote early on about &#34;what have we done to each other&#34; which I found interesting. What happens after years of marriage when instead of bringing out the best of each other, you start bringing out the worst. It also brings up the question of how well we really know our spouses. And what happens after that initial period when you are showing your best side, and being who you think the other person wants you to be? Another interesting topic is how one often acts based on what we have seen on the news and in the movies. What happens when you don't &#34;behave like a normal person would&#34;  and what are we basing&#34;normal&#34; on?  How ironic that the main character was most believed when he was actually faking it. Finally, what would you do if you start to realize your spouse really is psycho? I kinda wish at the end that the wife would have been more cunning in getting her husband to second guess himself and to start to believe that he were crazy and not his wife. The ending also touches on how we humans sometimes get through terrible situations by going through the motions, faking it for so long until you realize you aren't even faking it anymore. All in all, the book gave me a lot to think about so I rate it a solid 3&1/2 stars.
0812993292|4.0|This is a charming, light read that takes you on an unlikely journey with a guy you almost learn to love.  But not quite.  Poor Harold - always the victim, expecting the worst and usually getting it, most predictably from his mean-spirited, angry wife Maureen, who has expelled him from the family bedroom because she inexplicitly blames him for the failed life and tragic death of their only child.  I kept expecting Harold to transform himself from victim to hero in the course of his hike across England, and sometimes it almost seemed like he had.  But not really.  Though the ending of the story seems to imply some sort of redemption, it doesn't quite work.  Still I enjoyed the birds' eye view of England on the long walk with poor Harold.
B007HACDLK|5.0|With the conclusion of this book, Flynn leaves you wondering where does Mitch go from here? I for one, see the potential for a whole spinoff series, something I would most certainly welcome. Make it happen, please!

1609611543|1.0|I saw Dr. Davis on the Dr. Oz show recently. I was not enthused by his message. He seems like an overly passionate zealot. He recommends some other grains to replace wheat, however, he states not to eat too many of them either. He gives advise about having Pizza (made with wheat substitutions) but, how long would it take to prepare and bake it? If a person does have problems with certain foods they may want to look into this drastic change in diet (where one would have to cook everything from scratch - and who has time for that these days? Don't get me wrong, I cook at home everday by preparing vegies, salads, seafood, fish, poultry in simple low fat methods. I do not agree with the doctor that we all need to switch over to this plan. I'm glad I did not waste my money on this book. I almost bought it last year when my brother in law kept recommending it.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|As a business owner and entrepreneurship consultant, I found this book a wonderful look into the details and humanity behind a start up and operating a business. I'm always telling my employees and students that business is about people, not business plans. Steve Jobs is a perfect example of what that axiom means.<br /><br />As a PC guy, I had never paid a lot of attention to the details behind Apple or about the man himself. After reading Isaacson's book, I'm looking at my iPhone and the Apple stores with a heightened sense of respect and understanding. Well worth the time it took to read the book.<br /><br />Finally, I absolutely loved the author's multiple views of Jobs, from employees, vendors, family and friends. I've never read a history of someone with as many views. Like all of us, Jobs was a collection of personalities and that fact came through loud and clear. Refreshing!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Very cleverly written.  Could not put it down.  Alittle disappointed in the end.  Looking forward to other books by this author.
B003VANOFY|3.0|When I first got it, it was great.  The was good until I used the equalizer.  At first it worked fine.  Then about a month later, the speakers couldn't handle the bass no matter how I tried to equalize it out.  Went back the factory default which took out the vibration.  It works fine for music around the house and has a good range.  No problem with battery life.  Just can't utilize the 7.1 speakers.  I own a few Logitech items and never had a problem, but for $100, I expected better.
B003QP4BJM|4.0|I enjoyed the book.  There are parts that are a little repetitive and the point could be made in fewer pages.
B000FCK65W|5.0|My daughter recommended this book to me. At 58 and one who reads a lot I don't know how I missed this charming book about Francie Nolan (or is it about Brooklyn?). I loved every word. It was one of those books that I knew did not have an engrossing plot that chilled my nerve ends, I didn't care where it led me because I was living alongside a girl growing up in poverty who was teaching me about life. It is a story that both shamed me for my cavalier approach to material goods and gave me a renewed deep appreciation for the depth of the human spirit. If you have ever read Stegner you will love this book. The development of the characters, the easy flow of the narrative and at times, nodding your head in approval. It reminded me of Stegner's book 'Crossing to Safety'. I thoroughly enjoyed this read.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!  That is really all I can say about this game.  I remember sitting in the darkened movie theater when the Star Wars IV was released.  GREAT JOB!!!
0061020710|5.0|Terry Pratchett is a writing genius.  The books are enchanting and amusing throghout.  The entire Discworld series is well worth reading.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book had me crying with the characters! Something I will re-read many times I'm sure. I only wish there was a follow up to see where the next phase of their lives take them. Wonderfully written, you won't be able to put it down.
B00AHHODH2|3.0|***I received a free copy in exchange for a book review.***<br /><br />This 20 chapter book was okay. Heidi, Cindy, and Carla were part of the Gordonston Ladies Dog Walking Cub. The other member, Thelma, had died from cancer; she hadn't even been buried that long before Cindy and Carla fight over Thelma's husband, Elliot. The neighborhood was like Wisteria Lane times ten. They had secrets galore and were crazy. It was awesome how psycho people became towards the end.<br /><br />My favorite part was when one of the younger neighbor's visited Paris without her husband. Once she returned home, everything unraveled in everyone's lives. When I say everyone, I mean every single character. The story didn't just focus on the three ladies of the club; it also involved their neighbors (two couples, two older gentleman).<br /><br />It was cool once it was revealed who the hitman and director was. And I loved knowing when a character was plotting on someone else without their knowledge-it was like I was in on the secret. There were four hits requested throughout the novel but only one was picked. I liked how the ending suggested that the other ones still weren't safe. Like maybe there could be a sequel?<br /><br />The author was great with setting. The way he described things allowed me, as a reader, to see hear, taste, and smell what the characters did.<br /><br />The first chapter was impressive and suspenseful. A man dug up a hole and readers knew someone will die by the end of the book. But after that, there was a bunch of headhopping (unless it was written in the omniscient point-of-view? One time a dog's feelings was described), so I couldn't get lost in the story. It felt like I was reading about characters instead of getting a chance to go through their journey with them. It seemed like there was a lack of immediate scenes. The story had a lot of narrative summary, so I wished there would have been more showing rather than telling.<br /><br />The story started off slow,but towards the middle (and especially the ending), it picked up and was pretty interesting. I loved seeing the friendships and romantic relationships self-destruct. One other thing-facts kept being repeated throughout the story. I wish things were only told once (especially backstory). For example, chapter 1 and chapter 18 were exactly the same, word for word. I figured it was to remind readers that a guy was there to kill someone and now the plan was about to spring into action, but readers already knew that since the first chapter.<br /><br />If you think you can get past the repetitiveness, then give the book a try.
0547884591|5.0|Cut through the crap and learn how to live and to cook in the 21st century.  It's right here.  And when you finish, read the 4 hour body.  After that, pick up the 4 hour workweek.

B007VUA7VO|5.0|Like the fact that there is a graph of sorts that can tell me what battery life is left on my kindle fire at any time. I am a visual person and the graph is very clear and to the point.
0786955570|5.0|I bought this to play with my 7yo son.  Mindful that the box recommends that it is targeted to 12 year old, I had my son help me unbox the game with a plan that I would be very hands-on in an attempt to prevent any breaks or tearing during unboxing.  However, that wasn't an issue.  The components are very durable as well as very beautiful.  The game is fun and a 6 or 7 year old can play it with help from an adult.  It even helps with math and logic skills. It focuses on hack and slash more than a campaign-based game which focuses on story and character growth.<br /><br />Average games take 60 to 90 minutes but your first few games will take 120-150 minutes.<br /><br />Great fun!
B00886XQO0|2.0|This headset seemed perfect until I actually tried to use it. The first thing I did was pair them to my phone so I could hear how they sound. My impression was totally underwhelming. They just couldn't reach a volume that felt very satisfying and after only one song i wanted to take them off. That's because while they aren't heavy or uncomfortable, the leather and memory foam combo heats the ears. I figure I can get used to that but I had a heck of a time trying to get them to actually play sounds on my xbox or ps3. I paired them up just fine and hooked the wires to the correct ports but still nothing. Perhaps I'm just stupidly overlooking something simple but I certainly didn't find an answer in the instructions booklet. Its poorly written and skimpy on information. For the high price, it should have been idiot proof. My last gripe is that the headset feels rather cheaply constructed. It looks pretty but that leather isn't going to hold up well and the plastic components don't give me high expectations for longevity either.
B005FJ7DOM|5.0|The film is very similar to Zombieland, if a little different in plot and structure. An older man rescues and teaches a younger man how to survive in the recently destroyed world. They travel from community to community and set piece to set piece until the end of the film. It's a lot like zombie land, but that's not a bad thing. I enjoyed this film if for no other reason than it was exactly what I expected. A campy movie with some over arching messages about religious fundamentalism and how evil deeds transcend any human condition. It's a rare movie that gives different viewers each what they want. You can notice tropes and themes or just watch vampires be killed. A good way to kill some time on a Friday night.
B0096CDG0O|3.0|I am enjoyig this nice looking dice game. Not sure what happens though when a player drops out of a game by uninstalling or such. Is my screen going to be full of unplayed games?

0060557818|4.0|\\"Neverwhere\\" was a fantasy television series, devised by Neil Gaiman - apparently with Lenny Henry - for BBC Two in 1996. Gaiman later adapted the series into novel form. (The book was originally published by BBC Books; some alterations were subsequently made when the book was later published for the international market. This edition, the `Author's Preferred Text', is a combination of the two previous versions).<br /><br />Richard Mayhew has been in London for three years. Outwardly, he's very successful - he's working in securities, though there's plenty of pressure and he kept ridiculously busy. He's engaged to the beautiful Jessica, and they've convinced themselves that they're very much in love...though they really don't have a great deal in common. Jessica is very focused on her career, and is keen to \\"mould\\" Richard; she thinks he has \\"an enormous amount of potential\\" that needs to be \\"properly harnessed by the right woman\\". (One of Richard's colleagues finds her terrifying; frankly, he isn't far wrong).<br /><br />Richard's perfectly normal life comes to an abrupt end one Friday evening. He's barely made it through work alive, and has a torturous evening ahead of him - dinner, with Jessica and her exceptionally rich and influential boss, at an exclusive restaurant. Jessica has made it patently clear that this is the most important day of his life...so, when they stumble across a badly injured teenage girl, she isn't at all interested in stopping. Richard's conscience won't let him walk past though - it even forces him to ignore Jessica's threats to call of the engagement. Door, the young victim, asks him not to bring her to a hospital, but somewhere safe. Richard, knowing nothing of her past or the two very dangerous men hunting her, brings her back to his own flat...and, with that, his life in London Above is over.<br /><br />A very enjoyable book, full of gothic spookiness , memorable characters and - with the creation of London Below - a cracking location. Very much recommended for young adults and above.

B000MV90IU|5.0|Iconic movie featuring one of the best car chases ever! Let's also not forget that this movie stars Steve McQueen, the 'King of Cool'. Not too many of today's leading men measure up to the presence of a Steve McQueen. They just don't make movies like this anymore, especially considering the lack of Computer Generated Images and the fact that McQueen did all of his own driving. This movie is also the reason I fell in love with the Mustang fastback.<br /><br />Extra features on Steve McQueen were also very interesing as a look back at the man behind the persona.<br /><br />The pleasant surprise was that despite this movie being filmed in the late 1960's, the blu-ray picture quality was excellent, much better than I expected it to be.

B004VMUS9G|3.0|this app worked well for alarms, it was easy to use, and a free app at the time i got it
B000QRIGLC|5.0|Stunning account of Operation Redwing, very well written with courage and empathy.  You'll want to laugh, cry, and hold these men dear as you pray for their families.
B008FPOIT6|5.0|Kept my interest the whole time, couldn't put it down!  Was sad when it was over...  A great mystery, great fantasy~
0529064847|3.0|Very good translation of the bible. This is the translation we normally use for our religious education students in their classes..
B009JBZH54|5.0|For what you get for that price; you'd be crazy not to invest in it. Strong packing, beautiful booklet with full HD pictures in color, lots of extras and features. Great for die hard fans or people just looking to keep it as a collectible. Buying the stand alone makes no sense with this around.
B002CKCUOA|5.0|It arrived on time and in great condition. It is a collector's item so I will leave it sealed. I got it because my ancestor, Patrick Nagel, did the artistry for the cover. That is cool in itself, especially because I can't afford one of his prints.
B008PZ69T8|5.0|Fifty Shades of Grey: The Classical Album<br />Excellent choice for a Christmas present.  This album compiled the most beautiful classical music.
B008BTOVL6|5.0|I began watching the Big Bang Theory at a girlfriend's house during a pajama party and laughed so hard I cried.  It was love from then on, and I have been watching them throughout two seasons.  NOW, I have all five seasons and can watch them whenever I want (which is often).  Wacky, wacky, wacky!  Love 'em!!!  Heartily recommend that everyone have a place in their hearts and homes for the Big Bang Theory.
B004SBX112|5.0|my grandson got me addicted to angry birds and now i know why they chose that title.  i get very angry when i can't kill those stupid pigs!!  great game!!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This was purchased for my grandson.  He enjoys playing it. Would recomend for younger people i didn't enjoy it but he does.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|Very well done, pretty challenging and the missions are very good. Easy to get sucked into playing it for a couple hours...
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Fun to play. with no issues that I have seen. Lots of levels, let's you shuffle when no moves are left.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|JAMIE FOXX Is EXCELLENT as an innocent cab driver forced (after being contracted for the night to make make 5 stops) to drive the Cruise character (VINCENT) from kill site to kill site. This is an acting TOUR DE FORCE between CRUISE and FOX. Their chemistry together is GREAT. This is one of the BEST performances ever by TOM CRUISE--he is, absolutely, CONVINCING and TERRIFYING as a COLD BLOODED SOCIOPATH. INTENSITY guides this story. Certainly one of the best Micheal Mann (director) movies. This movie is very much character driven and the dialogue is great, but there is also MASSIVE ACTION. VERY HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.<br />TOM CRUISE is one of our greatest contemporary actors and, in my opinion, is grossly under appreciated (despite his many movies and wealth) because of his personal life. This is very UNFORTUNATE. I listened to those rumors and innuendo for years and and did not view his work. About 5 years ago I saw one of his movies and it totally changed me. He is a GREAT actor and VERSATILE in all genres, i.e. action, drama/melodrama and comedy. I am now a Tom Cruise FAN. I GIVE THIS MOVIE EVERY BIT OF 5 STARS. AND TWO THUMBS UP! IMDB rated at 7.6.
B0042JIL2E|5.0|Great stuff here. Imelda May is a terrific singer and her backing band is first rate. Her cover of &#34;Tainted Love&#34; is the best one I've heard since the Gloria Jones original. The title track and &#34;Johnny Got a Boom Boom&#34; (also found on her prior CD) are other standouts, but there really aren't any duds here.
B00005NB8K|5.0|If you like the Doors music and interested in the live of this prodigy, you must see and have this movie. Recommended
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|This was purchased for my grandson.  He enjoys playing it. Would recomend for younger people i didn't enjoy it but he does.
B007PJFIU6|1.0|42 of the cards are morose or depressing.  This game is being billed as the Family game for kdis 8+.  I am a 35 year old dad of a 3 and 5 year old.  As I was looking through the cards and had to hide them from my kids thinking they would give them nightmares.  The artwork is of high quality but a psychologist would analyze it and deduce that the artist has some dark demons to deal with.<br /><br />As stated 42 of the card of the 80 or so have either someone crying, pouting, scared, or trapped.  The ones that stand out is one with a pregnant lady holding her belly in a ominous misty setting with a meloncolly expression of abandoment.  Another is of a troll lady with an evil grin with a knife raised to slice.  Then a baby carriage that has a blanket covering whatever is inside while good and evil spirits fighting over the carriage.<br /><br />I am no way a prude or overly sheltered.  I have love my horror movies in my collection, Pandemic and Last night on Earth or anything zombie.  But playing this game as an adult you have to analyse what is going on in the pictures to put together a story to assit with the clues is just down right depressing.  Let alone to market it as a \\"Family\\" version.<br /><br />The cards are a little thin since they are the main componenet of the game. Some hardier cardboard stock would have been nice.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|One if the better fantasy novels I have read. Much less formulaic than others like WOT or SOT. Several surprising plot twists kept my interest.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I decided to pick this up, honestly only for Alien and Aliens. Alien 3 and Alien:Resurrection are two movies I don't care for, but at the price, it was worth having the whole collection.<br /><br />What I didn't realize was how great the packaging is. Not simply 4 blu ray cases that slip into a box. The box contains a hard book with the 4 discs inserted within the pages. Each page contains artwork from the different pages and is simply gorgeous to flip through.<br /><br />The quality of the picture and sound is great. I was afraid that because of the price, they quality of the transfer would be poor. I've experienced this with some \\"bargain\\" blu rays in the past. Now, keep in mind, I've only watched the first two, but the quality is great! Full, high def, blu ray presentation. Very well done!<br /><br />If you are a fan of any (or even ALL) of the Alien franchise, I highly recommend this set.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is a great family movie, one everyone can watch.  It is full of life lessons and will become a classic some day.
B002RVZV9K|4.0|I was dying to see this video, but after see it, felt short of my expectection, I was hoping to see more jaming for this great players specially from Page, but no. Still Good..
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great story, great character development, interesting twists.  I'm now reading &#34;First Shift&#34; the next in the series.  This explains alot.
1449410243|5.0|It's very funny and the whole family is enjoying this book. I bought it as a holiday gift for my children as we are all cat lovers...perhaps we should be a bit wary of those little critters. ;-)
B008YW5RH2|4.0|Fun and addictive game.  Great on the Kindle fire.  Only complaint is that it occasionally will freeze for a moment at just the wrong time causing you to miss the ball.
0451232852|4.0|great story line and now starting winter of the world.  The print is quite small.  I would suggest getting it in hard cover with a bigger print even if you do wear glasses.  btw  got a great deal on amazon!!!
B005LAIHPE|4.0|This is my kind of movie.  Blood, guts, guns, bigger guns, aliens and all the stuff that goes with this kind of movie.  I liked the cast and thought the movie was much better than the reviews.  My son in law even liked it and he is usually very critical of movies like this.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|This is a must have in your collection, superb acting by Phillips and Streep, a mery serious theme in today world.
0143039431|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time.  Steinbeck's writing is incredible and you just don't want to put it down.  One of the saddest books I've read in a long time.
B000AGTPUK|5.0|brings the book to life, the magic in the little ones eyes as they watch is a wonder to behold. this movie brings that something special back to Christmas. we are on our 2nd dvd we wore out our first with love. get this and the book too you will love it
B000FC13Y0|4.0|I liked the book, an engaging adult fairy tale, just wish it had more to it and hadn't been so short. I had first seen the movie Stardust and was pleased with it, so decided to look up the author. Worth the read, just very different from the movie( of course). Will probably read some other works by this author. Would recommend.
B007HACDLK|5.0|I never read Vince Flynn before, but I am going to go back and read his previous books.  Love the Mitch Rapp character
1451627289|5.0|I am not a Stephen King fan any more but this is an interesting book.  It is long at 849 pages but it takes a look at the JFK ordeal in Dallas through a different lens.  The book moved well for the most part and bogged down only once with too much detail.  Be careful reading it in bed at night as it might break your nose if you drop it on your face should you fall asleedp.
1423140605|5.0|Fan of Percy Jackson and Annabeth Chase as well as new and old demigods. You would love the series. HOOKED!!!
B00A5052YE|4.0|Alicia is definitely on fire with this one, however there was one item that did not download not sure what happened. However, I do love what I have so far
0395389496|5.0|my 8 year old lost his book that was well loved since he was a baby. this replacement book is still enjoyed years later. cannot beat a classic and this one sure will become a Christmas classic if it hasn't already
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|This product came in the mail within 2 days.  The kids love it.  They watch it daily.  Great children and adult movie!
B008Z9L8QI|5.0|Can't say enough good things about it.  The album sounds great and the bonus tracks are amazing!  Well worth it if you are a big fan!
B00337KM2S|1.0|Bought this long ago and we watched it a few times.  Threw it away when Clooney came out in support of BHO.
B0012Z361C|5.0|Magnifico!The concert and extra clips with the setting and scenery are beautiful. I will truly watch it over and over!
B004LUHQ1G|5.0|If you love Dave Grohl and if you love the Foo Fighters, this album is another for your collection. It doesn't break a lot of new ground, but it's Dave and the crew. Good stuff.
B004I744AS|5.0|use quite a bit. love the tid bits of info everyday and find myself reading the daily horoscope often! worth purchasing!
B009NPM5Y2|2.0|Three idea behind this movie is unoriginal but I had an open mind. Unfortunately the trailer picked out the only good scenes. The remainder of the movie was mindless, predictable, uninspired and too obviously fake. There were too many elements and not enough substance. Overall, just disappointing.
B0088X7YU0|2.0|I didn't realize this was a cartoon, and a not very good one at that. I really enjoyed the 3 movies, but this thing is not worth watching.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is very addictive and a good puzzle. A nice way to kill time when your bored and have nothing to do.
B005PZ85SO|5.0|I've never seen a bad episode of this show. If you like to get inside the minds of psychopaths and serial killers, this show is great for you!
0812984412|5.0|Made me feel the way I felt when I first watched Blade Runner....wonderful.  Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep was a dis appointment.
B008XBASVY|5.0|Chris Colfer is an amazing talent! This book has such a different theme about it than his first book and he still managed to make me want to curl up and never put my Kindle down!
B0076DCT2G|4.0|It's a good story, but it gets a little slow at times.  I'm looking forward to the next John Corey book.
B004JN1D2I|5.0|Well, like many I became a huge fan of A Song of Ice and Fire Series and despite the fact that I started a bit slow on the first book because it took me sometime to get to know all the characters, places and facts, after I finished book one I simply read the others almost non stop. I started reading the series on paper back, because I only got my kindle a bit later, but as soon as I got my kindle in my hands I bought the kindle 4 book bundle and had a great time!
B00962341U|5.0|Love Leona Lewis. She has angle's voice. The album is kind of different style from the previous ones. The song Trouble is my favorite.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Such a good book! Can't wait to read the rest of the trilogy! & I actually wasn't disappointed with the movie for once.
0440539811|5.0|If you have not read this, you must ask yourself this question:<br /><br />Do you like the standard fare? Is the mundane exactly what you want? Are you bothered by your inability to see the fnords!?<br /><br />If the last qualifier made sense, you already own this book, so stop reading a review on it, you already know what it's like, and I'm not writing this to boost your confidence or reasoning in liking it. Join the Legion of Dynamic Discord and go about your business without some pseudo-guru holding your hand while you make mouth-music and urinate, and stop reading reviews of stuff you're already checked out.<br /><br />For the rest of you, if the mundane no longer satisfies, if you want to have a deep peek into the realm of conspiracy parody, if you can handle way too many 60's and 70's references in order to get to the heart of an incredible expose of the human spirit, albeit through bathos, and finally, a hopeful tale of overcoming the masters of the universe, this is the series for you.<br /><br />Or maybe, I'm an agent of the masters of the universe, Cult of Cthulhu, Elder of Zion, Illuminati, etc. attempting to get you to join the Legion of Deluded Dupes, and this thing is nothing but an act to get you to read a book that will turn you into another one of my mindless slaves.<br /><br />So I leave the choice to you... or do I?
B005LLSNNE|5.0|like I said for season 5, it is great to review these episodes on my kindle, when I want, don't have to wait for it to come on tv.  the clarity was great, i would give it a 10 if you had that option
B007V2UGPE|5.0|Definitely one of my favorite games on my kindle fire. Would highly recommend this game especially if you have an obsession for zombies like myself!
B003YL4LYI|4.0|Well, I see that many fans like me got disappointed with the last published book of the series because it didn't answered so many questions, but I still had a great time reading it and I won't give it less stars and say that George R.R. Martin failed in this book like many fans did, because there are still two books out there to come and sometimes it's hard to finish every part (book) with 5 stars.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I'm 11 and I play it on the bus my friends love I think that it really fun I tollay love it I don't know what else to say I mean this game rocks great game
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Really really good movie. The hulk needs a revival movie as well. Too many bad raps from the last few
B0027MJU00|5.0|this author really kmows how to commumicate a scene. and Â«goodÂ» and Â«badÂ» become grey with blurred edges. again, great read.
B006CLTFP2|5.0|Love it. Love it. Love it. Love it. Love it. Love it. Love it. Love it. Perfect to fix your soa craving.
B007UW9WOQ|5.0|This is fantastic for any sushi enthusiast or peopel who love to learn more about how the sushi industry is revered in Japan. Jiro is a fantastic man with a lot of character and charisma. I smiled everytime he spoke or appeared on screen. :)
B0067AC5KA|5.0|These books are difficult to put down!  Larsson's writing has excellent flow, even though we're following several story lines simultaneously.  I hope hollywood purchased the rights to all three so we can see the second two up on the big screen soon.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|probably one of the best super hero movies ever made. Action! Humor! Suspence! I have watched it over and over!
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have read all of the Grisham books and he does it again.  Unexpected twists and turns and couldn't wait to get back to reading it.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|What Christopher Nolan has done for the onscreen legacy of Batman is tremendous and I think anyone who takes on making a Batman film in the future will have their work cut out for them. Below is my basic list of Pros & Cons for the film.  Pros  Bane - casting Tom Hardy as Bane was the best casting choice Nolan has made since casting Heath Ledger as the Joker. Not only is Tom Hardy qualified to portray Bane's massive size/strength, he's easily one of the most underrated actors out there today and what the man is able to do with 90% percent of his face covered is pretty amazing. Say what you will about the voice, I loved it. Like everyone else, I was barely able to understand what he was saying in that first teaser that was released, but our concerns were obviously heard because the voice turned out to be both menacing and intelligible.  The Story - I thought the story was well thought out, as engaging as TDK, and overall fulfilling for most of the people that are fans of these films and Batman in general.  Selina Kyle - Anne Hathaway is brilliant as Selina Kyle and I love that she was not referred to as Catwoman in this film, further removing her from the comic book realm and bringing her closer to our world.  The rest of the cast - Christian Bale, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freeman & Michael Caine have all been brilliant in every single one of these films and I am happy they all returned for one last go around. I've also got to include Joseph Gordon-Levitt & Marion Cotillard as well. I'm anxious to see what his interpretation of Batman will be if/when he gets a chance to play the character. Marion Cotillard has been great in everything I've seen her in, and I'm glad that they picked her to debut the character of Thalia al Ghul on the big screen.  Cons  The End - I'm not sure how many other people are out that wanted this as much as I did, but I really wanted Batman to die at the end of this film, and this is the biggest problem I have with this film. It would have been a perfect way to end this series for so many reasons, one being how can you have a movie in which the theme throughout is &#34;There is no hope without despair&#34; and have a happy ending? To me it's a contradiction to the film and a huge contradiction to what the Batman in these films stands for.  Bane's backstory - The minute they take away Bane's backstory in this film, they've taken away the heart of Bane. They could've easily left Thalia intact without giving her the backstory of Bane.  Overall this film is great, and there obviously more Pros than Cons (in my opinion). Watch it for yourself and make your own decision.
0394527771|4.0|This book provides an excellent analysis of several historical events that demonstrate just how we delude ourselves into actions that result in consequences contrary to our own interest.  Professor Mark Stoler (University of Vermont)in his course: A Skeptic's Guide to American History, points attention to \\"unintended consequences\\" and it is the consequence we focus on, not the intent.  Mrs. Tuchman takes us back to the intent and, in effect demonstrates Professor Stoler's point.  Also, while the professor states history does not repeat itself, Mrs. Tuchman clearly demonstrates that folly does.  In one example, she shows how the English folly that cost them America was repeated by America in Viet Nam.<br />Mrs. Tuchman chose four examples in history that met her definition of folly which she defines clearly in the first chapter.  Each example spans many years and crosses multiple political and philosophical lines.  From these examples the reader can apply the principles to understanding other historical events or even recognizing folly in our own day - if we can get past the fog of rhetoric that obscures our view and the noise of the crowd that prevents us from hearing the signals.  For those of us old enough to remember, Mrs. Tuchman points out about the early stages of Viet Nam (in 1954): \\"The American government reacted not to the Chinese upheaval or to Vietnamese nationalism per se, but to intimidation by the rabid right (McCarthyism) at home and to the public dread of Communism that this played on and reflected.\\"<br />I have given this book 4 stars instead of 5 for two reasons.  First, it is a bit dry to read at times and that makes for slow going on a very interesting topic.  Second, I did not think that the inclusion of the section on the Trojan war contributed anything to the over-all point.  For my taste it relies too much on legend and fantasy.  I believe that history is repleat with other examples of folly - although perhaps not so long to describe - thatwould have supported the argument just as well.<br />All and all this is a very good book that I recommend highly to all who have an interest in history.

B007IXWKUK|3.0|I wouldn't recommend this one to the squeemish...but if you want to know about an area of sexual deviation while luxuriating in Christian Grey's wealth and cheering on the naive Anna.....read it.  I wouldn't be caught dead reading it around the pool at the Seniors only RV Resort!
B00846REIS|5.0|Definitely pick Sylvia Day's book is you were glued to the papers of the Fifty Shades trilogy.  It's the classic boy meets girl,  woos and pursues her, and the rest is of the story line is hot enough to make your glasses fog up. Enjoy :)

B009RI4FRU|1.0|I was prepared to like this movie. Word of mouth reviews from others had been good.<br />But when I realized the child actors in the movie are in a sexual relationship and the young teen actress is in her underware for quite a few scenes, I was disenchanted.<br />What is wrong with the parents of these child actors to allow them in a movie with such sexual overtones.<br />Yuck!
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|I usually like thrillers and sci fi, but this was an over the top wonderful movie. Don't miss seeing it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I chose a 5 star rating on all 3 of the Hunger Games books because once I started reading the first one I couldn't put it down and when I finished the first two I HAD to buy the final book to know the outcome.  This whole series has a disturbing premise that (in my opinion) reminds me of the human penchant for cruelty and love of gore in sports....football, boxing, NASCAR (who doesn't just love a good crash?).  While at the same time the book explores the politics of suppression.  There is a theme of &#34;love conquers all&#34; however not without great sacrifice.<br /><br />An amazing read.
B004EPYZZI|5.0|This is a very uplifting story. I bought 2 more to give as Christmas gifts. It has a great message that anything can be overcome if you try

B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the kind of book you don't want to stop reading. I read it straight through except for one 4 hour break for much needed sleep. It was gripping. Every time I got to the end of the chapter I thought I can't put it down now I have to know what happens next. The imagery was amazing and it truly created characters the resonated with readers. I felt as if I could really feel the emotions they were feeling. Simply, this is writing at it's finest.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|The movie got here rather quick. It was new and wrapped up nicely. They did a very good job. Yeah!
1469984202|5.0|Book 1 - And so the brilliance begins.  As I expected with a Hugh Howey creation, I was immediately engrossed.  Howey is a master of his craft - he knows how to build a world and create a presence that is entirely believable and completely engaging.  I can see this part as a stand-alone, without subsequent books, but for a reader like me who has been violently sucked into the Silo I am thrilled that the story goes on.<br /><br />Book 2 - The story does not end with Holston's discovery of the outside world.  Back inside the silo, we are privy to life as it goes on after his departure.  Descriptive, gritty, seemingly real and tangible. I am reminded of a bee hive, with a nearly frenzied atmosphere of work, play and progress as it can be in a bunker deep underground.  There is a lot of tension between characters, and we tentatively like and trust some, while we suspect other characters of shady dealings and ulterior motives.  While the first story set the tone, the second story allows us to join this post-apocalyptic world.  And instead of a satisfying, tidy little package, Wool is tense and unpredictable.  And I want more!<br /><br />Book 3 - Ahem.  All I can say is: Mind.  Blown.<br /><br />Book 4 - \\"The Unraveling\\".  Oh so aptly named.  And so it is that this tidy little world, and everyone's perception of it, gets snagged and the thread pulls away from the design until there is nothing left except a messy pile of disorganized yarn.  The characters (and the reader!) finally are privileged to See.  Tension builds; something's got to give.  And this reader wants to know: WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT?<br /><br />Book 5 - As expected with the climactic portion of the book, the intensity and pace are ramped up to a hyper-speed worthy of some space war epic.  Very rarely does a book affect my pulse; this one literally had me stop to take deep breaths just to attempt to slow my heart rate and get some air!  This book had power.  Force.  I'm left reeling, in such a way that I need to recover from this trip to Sci-Fi fiction land before I can safely return to real life.<br /><br />And finally, I simply must declare that I Love Hugh Howey.  In that he's-my-new-favorite-author kind of way. A-Ma-Zing.I need to recover from this trip to Sci-Fi fiction land before I can safely return to real life.<br /><br />And finally, I simply must declare that I Love Hugh Howey.

B002FGU46C|1.0|Are about 8 months old this pair and still going ok. I have had Tevas before and they did not last long but these ones are doing better. Mainly bought these ones because of the anti bacterial thing they promote for the sandals. At first they felt uncomfortable to wear compared to other sandals that I have had from new. But it only took a little while for me either to get use to them or for them to bed in. From new they had multiple threads loose on the back ankle strap part, looks a bit fluffy but I didn't worry too much about it as mainly cosmetic but still would have expected more for the price. My main disappointment is they do smell after awhile or maybe my feet are just plain nasty and  no shoes or anti bacterial coatings will help. Depending on how much life I get out of them and price will determine if I would purchase again, they do  wear well and are quite comfortable now.<br /><br />Review Update<br /><br />Ok has been 10 months and yes I do use these a fair amount but this is the second pair of Tevas that I have owned and both pairs have not lasted a year. This pair have now split on both sandals on the sole and the fraying of threads are worse. I will not buy Tevas again as I do not think they are worth the money. I have had cheap no name brands handle more abuse then the Tevas and have lasted much longer.
B004K4AUZW|4.0|Lady Gaga is so misunderstood. She is very talented and this cd will prove that to you. Great listening for all.
B004I744AS|5.0|I find a wealth of information and facts in this digital dictionary. For a free dictionary plus additional facts I am very satisfied and would definitly purchase this apo but am more than pleased it is free. This comes highly reccomended.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Absolutly a great buy, why buy the stand alone movie for 24.96 when you can get all three for less than $30?
B00006EXL5|5.0|It has took me a couple of years to find this CD, having it been the last MCR CD I needed to finish my \\"collection\\" and I was really skeptical from such a low price and saying it was it good condition. But I took the chance and man am I happy! It took a bit to arrive but the suspense made it even better! Once it came in the mail I was jumping up and down like a little girl on Christmas day. The CD was used, but not a single scratch shown. It was great. I was very pleased with this CD.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|Great product, protects my kindle fire and makes it look nice. Its also sturdy and its surface is easy to clean
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Read it in a day. On to the next one before the next movie comes. I liked reading this one after watching the first movie.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|This is ''Clark Griswold'' at his merry best. The hopes and fears of a family celebration are certainly present in this rollicking, fun filled adventure. Clark and his jolly band of relatives along with two of the yuppy-est neighbors on the planet, give a new definition to the term; merrymaking.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love pintrest and spend a lot of time on this app. Only thing i don't like about the kindle edition is that after too long it sort of freezes and will kick you out of the app.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I Love The Books, All Three Of Them!!!!! I REALLY REALLY HOPE E L JAMES IS COMING OUT WITH A FORTH BOOK, Cause this Book Is The Best And I Love The Ending So Please Come Out With Another One ;)
0446580848|3.0|DeMille decided to up the inner monologue of Corey in this book and although I love the smart-aleck nature of John this was overkill. Once you get to the final 75ish pages (when the action finally takes place) it flies.
B009VB7QQA|2.0|Jus not my cup of tea, The star has no resemblance  to Abe. The plot was none existent. I gave 2 stars because my wife kinda liked it.
B0056JJXOO|5.0|A beautiful rendition of the classic Shakespeare tale - beautiful costumes, excellent cinematography (especially considering its 1968 release) and a classic story.  Remembered from my early high school English class.  A worthy member of my collection of old films!
B00A2XU9IS|5.0|I love it cause i play it on my moms phone but it wont let me download it its stupid i try to down load it it wont even try
B007W8S2MG|5.0|I never Persona series before and I did not pre-order the P4G game too but when the review score came out. It's stunned me !! I NEED to get the  game and try it once in my life. Then I bought it and OH MAN!! I am addicted to this game and the series!! for RPG or JRPG fan YOU MUST GET IT!!
B004LROUNG|3.0|I read a lot of Grisham's work so I know what to expect.  I do like his stories and will continue to read his books.  This one had a great start but I feel he lost a great opportunity with one very interesting character.  I felt the ending could have been a bit stronger as well.  All in all not a bad book but I've read better from him.
B007SGM084|5.0|Excellent read! You'll find it's hard to put the book down.  Be sure you have all three at the same time. You will want to start the next one as soon as you finish the first.
B002JVWR4U|5.0|This was another great show by Joss Whedon.  Eliza Dushku is one of his commonly used actresses, and one of my lesser favorites.  Still, she pulls it off, and the writing is fantastic. An interesting plot, wrapped up nicely in this second season.  For Joss Whedon fans... Season 2 of Dollhouse is like the movie Serenity was for Firefly.  You miss a few things in order for them to jump far enough ahead to finish the story he wanted to tell, but it's a heck of a story.
B0091VTNZC|4.0|My wife, kids, and I enjoyed this movie thoroughly.  Will Ferrell's performance was hilarious.  The way he played Buddy was very enjoyable.  It was a fun night and we all laughed a lot.  It was good to get to watch something all the kids (ages 4-12) were able to enjoy with us without profanity or sexual innuendo.
B004SJ3AXI|4.0|its really fun I like it a lot! its interrupts every once in a while with an add but for free game its not too shabby :)
B000L53D4O|5.0|got this for my son when he was 9 months old and learning to walk. It was the perfect height and wasnt heavy. He also loved playing with the various tiems on the front.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|Love it. Can just throw my kindle in my purse and I am on my way. This one is really neat.
B007SXB498|4.0|Sometimes we need the time to get lost in another era. Through Jane Austen's books we as women, can see how far we have come with our independence and make the effort to continue.
0316228532|2.0|I was so excited to receive the book.  As I read, I kept waiting for it to get better.  I felt like it was an assignment that I had to complete.  Perhaps I am not a sophisticated reader.  When I finished, I felt like I wanted my money back.  I have read all of the Harry Potter books multiple times.  I know this was an adult novel.  Since I am 71, I think I qualify as an adult but this book was a waste of my time and money.
B00000K3D4|5.0|This was shipped to me in great condition. Classic movie that is a great movie to watch with family. friends, or even by yourself.
B006C1DH92|5.0|this is a creative twist to the original fruit ninja.  its challenging, fun, and addicting. I like that you can switch blades and backgrounds and the mini games are exciting! great app :D
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I noticed some of the reviewers slamming this set. They claim the cardboard inside will eventually destroy the discs. I see no evidence of this being possible. Also noted by some was the lack of subtitles. Subtitles are there for the first four seasons just like my original individual seasons. Should have gotten this a few years ago!
B002BWP49C|3.0|My teenage stepdaughter has a vampire phase and loves these movies... Oh well, she can watch them in her room.... I don't care too much for them, but seeing how popular they are I guess it's ok for teenagers...
B000FC0OOU|5.0|When my mother passed away last year I found a first edition signed copy of this book that she received as a graduation present in 1940. I am preserving this copy, but wanted to read the text again. I decided that a kindle copy would help maintain the condition of the original. I had forgotten the unique use of language in that original edition and the Kindle edition is the same as that original. It was one of my mother's favorites and I understand why.
B009H442DG|1.0|Gone are the days of Grease for this once famed on screen couple. The vocals here are flat, Travolta talk sings through the songs, and his vocals are flatter than a dime on the sidewalk. Oliva sounds okay in parts, but the production and song quality are kind of poor. I don't think they should have reunited for this project until John got some vocal coaching, to make him sound at least a little more animated, and they had stronger more memorable songs. This is kind of embarassing for them I think... It's sad in a way.
B007HACDLK|4.0|Vince Flynn is a terrific writer. He keeps your attention to the very last page and leaves you wanting more. The Last Man is a continuation of the Mitch Rapp story. With each book I learn more of his life and feel as though I know him. I wasn't sure that I would enjoy the series that I had heard was violent. Well.. After reading the first book, I was hooked. Here was a mans man, but also a womans man. The stories are so related to todays political world that you would think<br />that they were being reported instead of a novel. Vince FLynn, bring on more.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Such a great book, you never know what's coming next!<br />What more could you want? Besides your own Christian Grey.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|An excellent novel, though not his best work. The plot became very convoluted (&#34;intricately plotted, with many twists and turns&#34;, as they would say on the jacket blurb.) It is set in an unspecified year, before the bomb-in-the-silo cliff-hanger. I wish the author would resolve that issue.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I had accidentally purchased the regular android version and not the kindle version, but the seller refunded my money so I re-purchased the correct version of the game. Great game. Loved the graphics of the game and it was very challenging.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|My daughter reads all of Sparks books and so I read this on her request and loved it. I am now reading more of his books.
0452273331|3.0|I meant to order Atlas Shrugged but clicked on the wrong book.  This one was returned and Atlas Shrugged was ordered.
0307719774|4.0|Allot smaller than what i expected. only a couple lines per day, per year! Would like to have more room to write and a larger book.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Everyone kept telling me I NEEDED to read Fifty Shades of Gray, that it was awesome!  So I bought the first book and read it. The lifestyle the book is about is not something I've done nor plan to do, and sometimes it was a little embarrassing reading it. The first book was the best of all 3.  The first book left me hanging, so of course I broke down and read the second book.  And then I had to find out how it ended. The last book seemed different than the first two, almost as if it was written by someone else, or written in a rush.  The ending had a surprise, there were details about the guy's (Christian Grey) childhood and how he became the way he was.  Then there was his view of how the first meeting went. Someone told me they were going to come out with a book of his views of the whole thing. I can tell you, I won't read it. His views are even more shocking than hers! I'm not recommending this book to any of my friends.
1400032717|5.0|On my second reading of this book I enjoyed Christopher's journey in a different way. I guess knowing the mystery (or mysteries) surrounding the 'curious incident' allowed me to experience a bit more of a bittersweet reading of the story.<br /><br />I also think I've matured a bit as a reader in the five years or so since I read this last time, so I enjoyed the way Haddon uses Christopher to position the reader too - he reveals much more than is immediately realised, and even though Christopher cannot really understand other people, we, as the reader, can.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Fun book. I wonder if WOOL is 700M (700 meters) backwards and upside down? As in, the silos go 700 meters underground.
B004SDSSFY|1.0|spent way too much time trying to get the app to run on my Galaxy S 3 and couud get no assisstance from DataViz web site or others.  Runs great on my Ipad, Itouch and on my old Iphone but now after having to pay full price again for the adroid app it doesnt work.  DataViz really needs to get this app together.
B0089AD8IO|3.0|This show is entertaining but from the reviews you would think it is one of the greatest TV shows ever. It is on par with a good Saturday morning TV show.
0345803485|5.0|It's a very sweet love story. I would describe it as an erotic fairytale with a lot of twists and turns. I have finished the trilogy in four days because I couldn't stop reading and I want more.

B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I could say the typical thing about gore and violence and dismiss this outright... but of course, I would be doing this program a severe disservice.  And I'm not a person to be sold on the 'zombie-apocalypse' genre considering the saturation in the market, but the relational aspect between the major players is a selling point that, as a Christian, I cannot ignore.<br /><br />It may not be for the weak of stomach sometimes, but there are good reasons to watch not only this season but the two previous ones.  As a Christian, I can say we worry about issues of mortality constantly though inconsistently (if you couldn't tell from previous elections).  Where this program shines is in personal reflection, where almost every decision necessary involves a moral choice that can have lasting, IMMEDIATE consequences.  Often while watching, it's obvious that the director is asking you to stop and wonder, \\"Would I be strong enough to do the right thing?\\"  But there is enough nuance in the choice that you may be wondering whether the right decision is the one that saves a stranger like we would any normal day as a good Samaritan or protects friends and loved ones against the rescue of an unknown person.  These scenarios happen all the time: Would I be willing to sacrifice myself if others could escape harm?  Would I risk making a run for medicine for someone who needed it?  I have what that person needs, but do I need it more?  They are not easy questions and you'll find yourself wondering it frequently.<br /><br />Of course there is plenty of good action scenes and the effects quality equals and even surpasses anything that blockbuster movies have put out in this genre.  As far as fear-factor goes, if my scaredy-cat wife can sit down week after week religiously (pun intended) and watch it, anyone adult can manage.  There are very few if any 'Jack-in-the-Box' cheap, cliche horror moments, and most of the fear is associated with a more mature suspense of wondering not if there is azombie, but how many.<br /><br />It has my whole-hearted recommendation.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book was definitely a great read.  Different look into the life of a great American Hero.  Well written and very hard to put down.
B007K3JFUQ|4.0|If you're a Robert Downey Jr.  or Jude Law fan, this is a must see.  He and Jude law work very well together as Holmes and Watson.  Lots of action, adventure, and comedy all rolled into one.  The props and locations were excellent.  Better than the first Sherlock Holmes film. Very Good Flick.
B009CGYO0K|3.0|It was ok; didn't knock my socks off. yada yada yada yada ysada yada yada yada yada yada yada yada
B008DM4OTA|4.0|VERY ENTERTAINING FOR MY 6 YEAR OLD. HE HAS ENJOYED PLAYING THIS GAME EVERYDAY ON THE WAY TO SCHOOL SINCE I GOT IT FOR HIM.

B003ELY7PG|4.0|This work presents short chapters that go straight to the point. It demystifies traditional concepts and techniques on how to manage your company!
B007DIQC90|5.0|This album has quickly become one of my most listened to! I love it. It has a folky vibe that is mellow and interesting, very engaging.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|If you're a Robert Downey fan, this is a must see.  He and Jude law work very well together as Holmes and Watson.  Action, adventure, and comedy all rolled into one.  Good flick.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|its great except i miss things because the news feed wont load prior events, and i cant check facebook all day
1451695195|5.0|Dr. Alexander should not be alive and talking!!  To have survived with no residual damage the totally impossible-to-survive infection as long as he did is unheard of in the medical world.  Being a leading highly respected neurosurgeon in his field gave him the credibility to speak out to his peers and the public and share what he experienced, and not be brushed off.  I appreciated his detailed discussion of both the medical and emotional aspects of what he went through.  This book is well written and worth every penny.  Please share with others.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Loved the whole ShadowFever / FaeFever series!  Worth reading!  I was hooked by the very first book! Give it a try.
B001GKJ2FM|4.0|If you love musical movies and ABBA music, you will like this movie.  It is a little on the corny side but overall a decent movie.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|this camera backpack came with the camera.  What a great deal.  I am a beginner in photography and it meets all my needs.
B0034G4P4O|4.0|The story was okay, though a bit hokey.  Good family movie for 9 years and older.  Put on the popcorn and have a family movie night.  A good watch and should be enjoyed by all.
0316228532|1.0|I loved the title. That's the only good thing I can say about The Casual Vacancy. It reads like a pay-back, like JK Rowling had some zoning-board dispute with the locals who didn't want her to put up a gazebo or some such and decided to vent her vitriol at them with a vapid laundry list of their limitations as human beings. It's a cruel book. Cruel to the characters, who are egregiously depraved each in their own way, and cruel to the reader, who keeps plowing through pages with the belief that something must happen, that this story must matter in some way or would not have been allowed to be published. What we have here is a famous author who has too much power to be told no. This should never have been given the green light to publication. It's a vanity project with a real mean streak. Don't bother to buy it.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I HAVE NOT WATCHED THIS MOVIE YET, BUT MY CHILDREN HAVE AND THEY LOVE THIS DVD, ESPECIALLY THE HULK. THIS WEEKEND I WILL TAKE THE TIME TO WATCH THIS MOVIE.  AGAIN  BOTH MY CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN REALLY LIKE THIS MOVIE AND TELL ME ALL THE TIME THAT ONCE I SEE IT I WILL LOVE THIS MOVIE.
B00A3ATW4M|3.0|As with a lot of TV shows that revolve around high school, \\"Glee\\" lost what made it great when the majority of the cast \\"graduated\\" at the end of last season. The new characters, while talented in their own ways, aren't nearly as good, in my opinion. And it reflects in the music. I love \\"The Scientist\\" and give that song 10 stars. Others, like \\"Some Nights\\" and \\"Holding Out For a Hero\\" are done really well. However, \\"Gangnam Style.\\" No. Just no. If that song were not on the album, I would have given 4 stars.
B001GCUNWQ|5.0|Our family likes movies.  The Ice Age series is a favorite.  This one was a good movie at a good price.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Once you have read the first book you have to read the second to see what takes place next.  Excellent
B000HKW7E0|5.0|I love this movie and have spent many a Christmas Eve watching it.  My old copy was worn out so I purchased this.
076115728X|5.0|Nicely addresses the perennial problem of making a mistake when creating visual art.  Highly recommended for all elementary schools and any other center where creativity is valued.
B007PAAO0Y|5.0|Mr. Womack keeps up with the times by employing some hip hop producers who do a nice job backing him up. The songs flow with pleasing beats that sound terrific. Only complaint is that it isn't long enough, but it's still fulfilling. Props to Mr. Womack for stepping out there and taking a chance with a new sound. Bring it, Bobby!
B0025KW29U|5.0|This is absolutely hilarious!! Neil Patrick Harris is great in everything he does and this role seemed written for him.  I only wish it was longer than 45 minutes or there were more episodes.  Dr. Horrible tries to be evil in so many ways, but his heart is so much better than the supposed hero - Captain Hammer (played perfectly by Nathan Fillion).  I would recommend this to any fan of Joss Whedon.
B004SL6OBQ|5.0|My boys and I love the music from the motion picture, Rio.  It is lively, catchy tunes with a Rio De Janeiro feel.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who likes to read romance novels.  Just keep an open mind that most of this is fantasys.
0596009208|2.0|If you are a beginner, stay away from this book. It will leave you in the dark from the beginning. I have some programming knowledge, but Java and Object Oriented Programming are totally new to me. Just to start, this book will not teach you properly how to compile your programs. So, I had to search for it on the Internet, and it took me a few hours to be able to run the first program. There are only a few exercises in each chapter, what makes it harder to keep the new information inside your head. Besides, there are a lot of puzzle exercises, that are completely useless.<br /><br />The authors say that if you know something about loops or if/then logic, you will be fine, but that is not true. For example, some source code files will not compile because there are \\"packages\\" statements that the book won't tell you what they mean. They assume you know what a pointer is, they keep saying things like \\"if you are a c++ programmer, then...\\" (what gives us a hint of who this book is really for)<br /><br />In the first two chapters the authors assumes you have a deep understanding of Java, and then, suddenly they come to basics in chapter 3. At chapter 6 the codes become much harder to understand. A lot of objects \\"talking\\" to each other in a poorly organized way that will make you suffer to understand. At the end of chapter six, I decided to look for another Java book.<br /><br />The worst flaw in this book is that it tries to teach you Java assuming you know some fundamental programming concepts you don't. At some point the authors say that thay will leave anything that might get in the way out, to make it easier for us to learn, but it turns out that they leave out so many fundamental concepts that the beginners will not be able to build a solid foundation and will frustatingly give up this book.
B007MDB6L0|5.0|Great story about friendship. We love to watch this with our daughter on family movie night. We are glad we got it.
B00005JM02|5.0|Our 3 year old grandson loves this movie.  We are very satisfied with our purchase and the price was very good.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|This book drove concepts into the ground. Chapter 49 is a total space taker that just wastes time. The plot is thin. The wise cracking is too much. Redundant.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The Fifty Shades Trilogy is one of my favorite book sets. If you liked Fifty Shades, you'll also love the Bared to All trilogy as well.
B005VPRET4|5.0|my daughter loves all the lego friends.  and this one is just as adorable as the other ones we have purchased.
B0053O89Z6|5.0|A must have for all the 'Barnyisms'. there are some episodes that you just have to watch over and over again. The packaging is good. No scratched or broken discs.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|A good movie about taking responsiblity for one's own actions and not blaming others. We really liked this movie. Some scences were initally a little scary for our 3 year old but now she is OK with those scenes.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The tale continued to evolve into different outlooks, ever-changing situations which kept the reader often more than one step behind the reality.
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|This is another fine example of what the band is capable of, and I highly recomend it for Santana fans, you won't be disapointed.
B0041KKYGU|5.0|I went with friends to watch this movie last summer. It was hilarious. I was very excited to get it for $4.99 this season.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|Such an awesome book! It was written in such a unique way, and I can honestly say I've never come across another book like it before. I enjoyed it so much, the characters and the world that Morgenstern created was by far one of the most amazing I have ever come across.
B000OT6V00|5.0|After trying to watch this on Netflix with all the stopping and restarting, I decided to just buy it. We always have movie night weekends and watching this and the second prove to be an exciting and entertaining night.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I think the hunger games is very breath taking and so is the movie I would recommend this book to people who like action or adventure or if you just enjoy amazing and breathtaking books.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I liked the characters in the book.  They were real and believable with complicated relationships and  feelings.  This isn't the run of the mill love story.
B0002V4SXC|5.0|It doesn't matter what he does I like it and I recomend you listen to it if you aren't familiar with his music !!!!
B005LAIH4A|5.0|This is a great Dr. Seuss movie. It was purchased when it became a lightning deal. My boys love it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Another great read! The story takes many twists and turns but keeps one focused on the ultimate outcome.  Be prepared for a surprise ending.  This author has written a story with great suspense.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This was a great movie and I love that it comes with the 3d, blu-ray, dvd and digital copy. The price was good.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Not as good as his others.  Slow. Too wordy.  Pillars of the earth his best, could read it again and again
B000O8OTNC|5.0|This is the second sharpener I purchased. I loved the ease of use, portability, and durability of this sharpener. My knives all come out razor sharp in only 2-3 minutes<br /><br />Update. After further use, this sharpener is still extremely handy but in sharpening it removes too much material (carbide section), but still great for backpacking/camping when you just want to \\"touch-up\\" your knife (ceramic section).
B007KDFWRG|5.0|These two are new together but I've seen Derek Trucks a few times with the Allman Brothers and I think he's GREAT and she's really good herself !!!!!
B001UV4XFQ|5.0|I am a big Twilight fan.  If you liked the Twighlight books by Stephenie Meyer, you will love this movie as well.
B001F7MSG6|5.0|I had been looking for this movie every where. Couldn't find it at the stores or even on Netflix. They had the first one. This is a great movie filled with action all the way through. The drunk singing is one of the best scenes.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I always enjoy the Scarpetta novels and this one is no exception.  I was waiting to buy this in paperback and then decided to buy a Kindle Fire HD.  This was my first novel read on the Kindle.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app Calculator Plus is the best calculator app...it does all the calcs that you need and has the BEST &amp; CLEAREST display of any cakculator app I used!!!  Must have!!!
B00004Y6NU|5.0|I've said it before and I'll say it again Dire Straits stuff is gold. I love it, I think its all good stuff !!!!!!
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My whole family loves Rio. It is a vibrantly colored movie with catchy music. This was bought when it became a lightning deal.
B008PNBU30|5.0|Once I heard 'I hate everything about you' I fell in love with this band. Their songs are amazing! I have all their albums and they only get better. A must have for any Rock lover.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|Wonderful movie, I absolutely in love with the hilarious commentary. Niel Patrick Harris and all the other actors were phenomenal.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Aside from the obvious &#34;shock value&#34; of some of the passages, the message is loud, clear, and simple: feminism is simply to be polite to everyone, regardless of gender.<br /><br />Well said! And with a good dose of laughs thrown in.
B00000612Q|5.0|What a cool CD I love it !!!! I think it's got a little bit of everything that Rod Stewart is known for, on it.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|I have loved Disney movies since I was little. My boys are the same way. This is the most recent Disney movie and we got it on sale during Black Friday. It's a great movie at a great price.
B000OVLBIU|4.0|Upgrading my DVD collection to Blu-Ray. Good movie. Not one of his best movies, but definitely worth a watch. The price is worth it.
1451662432|5.0|I just started the book, I have read only several chapters, but you know what? Already I can say that it's even better than I expected.<br />This is not just another autobiography full of facts.<br />This is a life story of an outstanding man. His memories, his experience, his lessons learned. Sometimes it is very emotional, sometimes it is funny, you know, just like the life itself.<br />And it is very inspiring.<br />I strongly recommend this book to everyone, no matter if you are Arnold's fan or not. This book can not only feed your curiosity. It can teach you something.<br />If Arnold could conquer the world, you can do it too.
0425263916|5.0|Love It!!!! The characters were amazing, similar to Fifty Shades, but steamer....can't wait for the 3rd book to come out :(
B0000AKCLS|5.0|This is one more GREAT CD from this guy. He's kinda unheard of but I don't know why ??? I think he's GREAT !!!!!!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I bought this for my nephew as a gift.  It was a great gift at a good price.  It arrived in plenty of time.
B007OV9EYG|4.0|I didn't see this in the theater because I thought it wouldn't be that great. It was very entertaining. I borrowed it from a friend to see and couldn't resist getting the 3d version when the price dropped. It is so much better in 3d!
B007TXN4TK|5.0|its a super good app it entertains you and i love playing on the piano if you play piano or get like it get the app its really awesome
B00371QQ0M|5.0|Thanks! A great movie updated in Blu-Ray, can't ask for anything else. thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks
B0000025ZF|5.0|I really like the way Roger Waters thinks it just seems all of his stuff is really good as far as I think, anyhow.
B009CG2YDE|2.0|Simple game, space invaders with tilt controls. Problem is, there's no way to calibrate the sensors and my velocispider always seems to want to jump to the right. Not sure it's just the calibration, either. If I hold my tablet tilted all the way to the left, then my character should be stuck on the left wall, but still it tries to jump to the right. This game could be a lot better if there was some way to calibrate the controls, but it still might be jumpy.<br /><br />If you like the idea of playing space invaders with a character who has sporadic seizures with you tablet tilted all the way on the side (when in portrait view), then this might be the game for you. Otherewise, I think this game could use an update. Either way, I won't be keeping it on my device (Toshiba Thrive).
B008EQIEWS|2.0|The movie is great, as you can see by my review on the 3d Blu-Ray edition. This Instant Video came with the purchase of the movie. The restriction on when you could watch the movie made it impossible for me to take advantage of it. I have seen it on my iPad through the digital copy. If the restriction was not there, I may have enjoyed having this for free.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|the best music video app in the world its great if you love music videos or just want to listen to some music
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Amazing! High Quality! Durable! Easy to apply! This thermal compound is all out amazing! I've repaired so much with only this 3.5g! Worth the buy!! (;
B000002N25|5.0|I highly recomende this CD for any Mark Knopfler fan, you'll love it probably as much as I do !!!!!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|Loved it, it was as good as all of Vince Flynn's books.  Can't wait to read the next one! Write quickly!
B00005JMXX|5.0|This is an amazing movie! one of my favorites, and the DVD is just as amazing. Highly recommended to anyone who enjoys this type of movie!
B000PC0U1W|5.0|this movie is an instant classic. Just like Fight Club. For those of you that like to think on your own hey for yourself. It's a great movie.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|The 4 grandkids loved the blocks.  I had bought them 200 at the store in Charlestown, SC but another 200 were needed.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|I know I really like any Dire Straits that there is, so this is just another must have as far as I'm concerned.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I have long been a fan of Patricia Cornwell, she never disappoints.  This story held my attention throughout, and kept me up all night reading.  A winner.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|This is an amazing movie and an amazing DVD! I'm glad that I bought it and the price was GREAT!!
B008WCP2PG|4.0|The men in this movie are well worth the lack of storyline. I enjoyed that part of it for sure!
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Love the new Batman movies. Heath Ledger's performance is fantastic. Greatest movie villain of all time. I can watch this again and again.
B000E6UK5K|5.0|David Gilmour another GREAT Pink Floyd mind doing his own stuff and I love it !!!!! I think you would too.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Narrated by Death, this books takes you through the life of a little girl who is living in Hiltler's Germany. This book is haunting and  hard to put down. A bit &#34;choppy&#34; in places, but this does not distract from the beautiful story told by Zusak.
1476715904|5.0|This book had me at page 1. I loved the characters so much. I read it in one day. I bought the second book 2 seconds after I read the first and I \\"butterflying\\" love this series so much that I want to read it again, right now. You will fall in love with this put together family and love each person they know. They boys are so funny and my heart goes out to their hardship of losing their parents. This is a good book to demonstrate integrity. These characters are doing such a good job raising the boys, for their age. And their love is something that is so strong that I gives you goosebumps. I laughed so much and cried my eyes out with these 2 books. A MUST READ!!!! Give them a try. I was shocked at how wonderful they both are!!!!
B003L77G06|5.0|We just can't stop laughing, one of our most favorite comedy TV shows EVER! and that's all I have to say about that, it explains it all.  Will collect all seasons.
B009FZHYKU|3.0|Feels like they're stretching out the story line in order to have a longer season to sell more advertising. The first season - awesome. Second season - pretty great. Third season - becoming more and more disappointing. May not even bother to watch the rest.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|I've only been listening to this guy for about 2 years but I gotta say he sure doesn't get the credit he deserves !!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this program because I can sync my Kindle Fire w/my computer or vice oversaw. That way I know I'll never lose an important note that I had to write while away from home especially since I need notes for reminders. So I can make a note on the computer and know it'll be on my Kindle when I need it.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Being a latecomer to the Walking Dead, I caught up on the first two seasons, then had to seek out the season 3 episodes I had missed. Amazons video rental fit the requirement with a great streaming product, that didn't stall or need to spool. Now that I have seen all of the episodes I am up to date and enjoying the new season!
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|There are just some classics that a collector needs, this is one of them. An excellent movie, and actor Peter O'Toole is outstanding as Lawrence. This was a true spectacular in it's day, what am I saying in my day too! Anyone who hasn't seen this won't be disappointed.
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|Great movie to watch on the couch with your girlfriend.... silly, funny & cute and doesn't last to long. &#34; No I said dart gun...&#34;
B0012GMVQC|5.0|This is one of the last Jeff Beck CDs that I've bought and I think I should have bought it sooner !!!!!!!!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Stephen King at his best.  Not only a good time travel story but a heck of a good story by any measure.  Hooks you right from the start with characters that you will care about.  I have been a King fan for years and loved his books since reading the \\"The Stand\\" back in the 70's.  Many have never tried King because they assume he just writes horror stories.  If you are not a fan, this one may make you one.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Delicious and villainous.  I couldn't love this show more and was happy to find it.  I can't wait for the next installment!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Finally ! I could get this movie and on Blue-Ray and 3D.  Great special affects and viewing it from the comfort of our couch makes this a must have.  Enjoy !
B007H9B8FS|5.0|After much anticipation, I was very happy when I received &#34;Not Your Kind of People&#34; - I ordered the deluxe version as I don't understand why if you like a band you would settle for anything less!  Have been a fan of their music since their first album and they did NOT disappoint with this one!
B0033AX1YG|5.0|This guy is becoming one of my favourite guitar players, I love everything I've heard of him so far !!!!!
B0058VA2U4|5.0|Hello boys! Nice to have you back.<br /><br />Great album. Not a bad song in the bunch. Can't wait for the follow up.
B003L77GH4|5.0|My mom loves this show -__- so I got it for he and she's way happy. I'm sure I'll be buying all the newer ones for her real soon.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love this game it is soooo fun,  and challenging!<br />My kids love it,  and it helps with their learning skills!
B000HKW7E0|5.0|My favorite Chritmas show ever. Chevy and Randy are great in this movie. They keep you laughing with all the crazy happenings going on!
B000093OU8|5.0|This guy never gets boring to me I always hear something new every time I listen to his stuff !!!!!!!!!!!
B004KD5TQI|5.0|When I first watched this movie, the bizareness of it was complimented beautifully by the soundtrack. 'Sweet dreams', 'White Rabbit', and 'Where is my mind' are amazing versions of already amazing songs. Buy it now. You know you want to.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Since I have read all her 3 books now and each one is Fabulous, and since I can't put them down, I find myself reading each one pretty quickley. I just wish Ms Flynn could write faster.....I need another Gillian Flynn &#34;fix&#34; soon!
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I only watched this movie out of curiosity. Viewing the trailer let me know it was going to be a hit...and it was ! Johnny Depp should have gotten an Oscar for his performance. You will not be disappointed with this movie, it is both amusing and entertaining..especially for baby boomers! One you want to add to a collection!
B000IZ8SD8|5.0|I'm a major Trekkie.  I have seen this many times, adding it to my Star Trek collection.  Great story and acting.
B004NCOQCE|5.0|This is a CD that I didn't know exested even though I'm somewhat of a big Jimi fan but I bought and I love it !!!!!
B007712XAU|5.0|This is without a doubt one of the best series that have been on PBS.  You will love the characters and time period is very interesting.
B00540G3G6|4.0|It was an excellent value including bluray,dvd and 3d versions.however the 3d version lacks Spanish dialogue which is only included in the dvd version. The item description did not reflect this and I had purchased this for my dual language class.
B00A77II0U|5.0|I really enjoyed all aspects of this game including the story line and some of the challenging puzzles.  I especially like that it came with a strategy guide that helped you know what areas in the game needed your attention.  Overall it was very enjoyable and worth the price.
B003DZX3SA|5.0|I bought this to replace my vhs copy. What can I say it's a timeless classic. I hope my kids learn to appreciate it as well.
B00004Y6NT|5.0|This is a pretty cool CD I think it's very listenable at any time you want to hear good music !!!!!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Very good read.  I do wish he would leave his political proclivities at home.  I've understood for several books now that he is a socialist.... enough already Ken.  Get on with your story telling.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|The movie itself is great and I am extremely happy that I purchased it through Amazon.com.  However, It was supposed to be delivered on one day and was actually delivered 3 days later- and I was tracking the package so I know the mail carrier had it when they stopped that day.  The other issue was the packaging of the movie- It is completely trashed!  The spine is broken in half, the clips that hold the double sided disc insert are missing/broken off.  And I am looking for a case to replace this one.  Otherwise I cannot say enough good things about the movie- its the packaging and delivery issues that concern me.
1451696191|1.0|December 7, 2012<br /><br />Dear Friend,<br />I just finished Perks of Being a Wallflower and I have to say it was a very poor read. I believe Mister Chbosky has a vision of what he believes unpopular kids are like in high school and he misses the mark. The characters are not developed well and the fact that there isn't really a story to speak of is bothersome. About half way through the book I asked myself, why should I care about this kid? I decided to be optimistic and said \\"I will just have to wait and see\\". Well, that moment never came for me with Charlie, not even close. I felt that the book was written well from the stand point of trying to mimic a 16 year old loser's voice. Also, there is way too much crying. I mean Jesus,  all the characters cry at the drop of a freaking hat. Steven Chbosky needs another way to show emotion in his characters! If you like short books that don't have much of a point and don't develop characters well and suck balls then read this book. Otherwise read Rule of the Bone, it is a much better coming of age novel.<br /><br />Your Friend, Jim
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I'm a fan of Angry Birds, and when I saw there is a new game by Rovio I immediately got excited.<br /><br />I have to say that this game did not disappoint. It actually proved to be more than I expected. Birds are fun, but there is just so much variety you can expect. Pigs make you think, make different combinations of insane driving, riding or flying machines.<br /><br />The thing is that it does take a little while to get used to it but once you do it is AWESOME!!!<br /><br />(and you still get to blow piggies up)...
1419705849|5.0|This product arrived before the estimated time. My son started reading as soon as it came out of the mail box. He loves it.
B0010HA68I|4.0|keeps the camera in one place and helps take the weight off my neck on longer hikes preventing neck aches
B000O8OTNC|5.0|very nice to have and i like having a carbide and a ceramic in one! i think i need 2!
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|The case is excellent if you just want a protective cover but if you are looking to use it to prop your Kindle up as shown in the picture it does not work because the second you touch the screen to turn a page you knock it over and it is really irritating.  So if you are just looking for a protective cover go ahead but if you want to use the easel feature move on to another case.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I loved this game on iPhone and now I play on kindle for a larger screen. Really awesome game! I love it. Challenging with ought being so hard you can't play after one round like some games.
B007QPFGJW|2.0|I enjoyed one other book by Nesbo, so thought I would enjoy this one also.  I didn't care the way it was written; it confused me at times.
B005SFS4ZU|5.0|Amazing production. Andrew Lloyd Webber did it great again! This celebration of the 25th anyversary is exciting! I love it.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This sexy Kill A Bear is a hunk of steel! 1/4&#34; thick! came out of the box pretty sharp, i just finished it off and i got a knife that makes rambo tear up a bit. the price is a super good deal considering KaBar is selling them for over 100 bucks and some stores ive heard around 120! get one while you can at this price...its a monster!
B002RI9PS6|4.0|This book was a good read with likable characters in an interesting predicament. It is a cultural experience that bought together two sisters who have been to  estranged to fight a common ememy. At times funny, a little sad and confronting.
B002N7CTKM|5.0|Community is one of the few shows that I still watch on tv.  It is amazing and everyone should watch it.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Loved the packaging. Had a cool velvetish feel to it.<br />Love the movies more though.<br />Arrived in great time. May just stick with this edition instead of buying the super duper collectors edition later.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|I totally enjoyed this miniseries.  Historically it's accurate.  The actors were believable.  I recommend this film to history buffs and nonhistory buffs alike.
0062183591|5.0|Great read  We choose this for our bookclub and so glad  that happened.  Looking forward to more of his books
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I feel as is if I was slowly dying (much like the characters) in the most beautiful and strangely addicting way as I read this book. Which was only a day after starting it. Me, being a slightly cowardly person, the type that if something is sad or painful I normally choose not to acknowledge it's existence. However I can't say that I have any regret in reading the complex, yet simple, funny, yet heart-achingly sad, story of this book. ( Well I  could, but I'd  be lying).  Unlike in most YA books, the female narrator did not repulse me, nor was the plot of a young girl who is bound f o r ultimate death so depressing it was unreadable. It made look at life differently, which is such a cliche it pains me to say it. How ever, in the grand scheme  of things I would highly recommend  reading this book.<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />  A teenager.<br />P.S.- We are all just a side effect.
B004SD5GZ4|2.0|flash player for the Kindle Fire HD is needed.<br />I would like to listen to some radio stations, but cannot.
B001TN1EBG|5.0|one of my favorite new artists (at least new to me).  Definitely would recommend it to others to buy :)
B004UID2LC|5.0|I love this app. FREEdi is my new favorite app. I can watch any video I want wherever I am even without using wifi
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I did not keep this app - it wasn't user friendly to me.  Maybe someone younger would have more luck.
B000MCH5P4|5.0|I rarely find movies I enjoy.  Very often they are so predictable or similar to all the other movies of the same genre.  I loved this.  Great acting, storyline interesting and gripping.  I loved the settings of the Moroccan village and desert, the stories of the Moroccan families.  Really worth watching.
B0058W74UY|1.0|adobe flash player is needed.<br />this did not fill the bill.<br />i am not using it any more.<br />i tried this when adobe flash was not available.
B009SQRL4U|4.0|Enjoyable movie... drags a little, but good character development. Enjoyable for a one-time watch. Wouldn't buy it... good around the season.
B00AHSIQWE|3.0|The playback skipped a few times and at one point stopped playing.  I had to rewind it and wait for it to load.  Other then that the quality was decent.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|I feel like a bonafied badass when I listen to Radioactive while walking down the sidewalk. The album overall is good and avoids sounding like one giant song.
B009G7ZYPY|3.0|I love Susan Boyle!  I would have liked it better if she had left the men off.  Neither was a complement to her voice.
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|This is fine to a point.<br />I need to be able to link files so that they update one another.<br />some people don't need this option but I do to do my work.
B0072OFM28|5.0|The back stabbing by the key players is so intense and the whole story line with all the killing and sex is really great. If you saw the earlier episodes you really have to get this one.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|This movie grabs you and holds you until the end. I was on the edge of my seat and gasping at times. This one isn't for small children in the room.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Grisham did it again.... another spellbinder...Perry Mason -style.  All of us old enough to remember Gardner's lawyer-detective<br />will love this one
B0012BYSUY|4.0|perfect for house hold and recording equipment, very bass punchy and crystal clear. The amp extension  is what sold me works great on amplifiers.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I dont write reviews often but this is game I can't stop playing. I hope more puzzles will be added very soon. Highly recommended for those who like a challenge and want their little gray cells exercised.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have a couple of others from Jillian Michaels and like all of them.She has designed some fantastic exercises that anybody can do without hurting yourself.
B00192IV0O|5.0|the price is good and i love the song i got the feeling<br />its a great song to dance song
B007FG9LIE|3.0|I finished this book last night and it was a very quick read.<br /><br />For certain aspects of this book, I really enjoyed the book.  For others, I really do think this is a book that is just ok that could've been great.  It feels like a rough draft rather than a finished copy.  The ending is abrupt and things aren't neat and clean.  Although you have to suspend your concept of reality a little for this book, there were certain aspects that are so far fetched that just don't make sense at all.  I would've loved to give this book 4 or 5 stars but it is more on the 3 star range based on its incompleteness.
B004U52VPS|2.0|A friend bought this and the Space version over black Friday. Both are of equal quality. That is, they're cheap. I was pretty excited to try it, but found them both lacking. The blocks are too light and slippery to easily assemble by a child. I don't see anyone under 8 years being able to do this successfully. And a catapult? It is very weak with a range of about 2 feet. A slingshot would have worked much better.<br /><br />As it were, the price is about equal to the quality you get. If it were made of heavier material so that assembling doesn't resemble disarming a land mine it would be much more fun for younger children.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|This may be more addictive than Angry Birds.  There's definitely more of a creative element to the game.  It might actually be educational for kids.  Unfortunately kids these days don't get to build things &#34;Spanky and the Gang-style&#34; like people my age did, so the problem-solving and building aspects of this game might be a somewhat decent replacement for building ramps from scrap lumber and gocarts from lawnmowers.  Well, at least it occupies me when I'm in the dentist's waiting room.
B004YM6JI2|4.0|I really got into this series and series 7 fits right into the previous story line. cant wait for series 8
B005OK722U|5.0|Before I watched this movie I left the following review. I couldn't say I never saw it, because then no one would have took the review seriously, but I just basically gave some facts about the director/producer which is all still true. I just want to add that I actually did like this movie. I guess it can still be considered a let down to true hostel 1 & 2 fans, but as a horror movie period, I thought it was really good. Definately worth a watch in my opinion, but as far as the people leavig negative reviews, I can hear them out too because if you read the following review which I left in the past, you'll learn this producer's history of botched sequels. I rated it 5 stars, but left my old review so you can consider the facts. keep in mind I rated this movie as a standalone film, not as a seguel. You can watch this if you've never seen the 1st two and it will make perfect sense. Here is the old review:<br /><br />I breifly skimmed through some other reviews and I saw more negative than positive, but in the negative reviews, all it seemed like people were commenting on was the surprise in let down from a sequel and the poor plot ect. What it seemed to me a lot of people didn't know is that this third installment is actually not even made by the same people at all, which I thought was weird and a turnoff right from the start. Hostel one and two are written and directed by Eli Roth. Roth is probably best known for hostels 1 & 2 and the movie Cabin Fever. The first two also featured the movie master himself Quentin Tarantino (Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, Inglorious Basterds, ect.) as an executive producer. What is strange and sort of a red flag about hostel 3 is that both writer/directer of the entire hostel series (Roth) did not make this sequel and producer Quentin Tarantino was not involved. I'm not sure the specific story of how it happened, whether the hostel franchise was sold or whatever, but knowing that definatly set my expectations low. Especially knowing that roth and tarantino are very hard acts to follow. Another reason to set your expectations even lower is that the \\"Roth Replacement\\" on Hostel III is Scott Spiegel. Now don't get me wrong, I'm not very familiar with Spiegel and I don't want to say he's never made a good movie, but is anyone reading this review familliar with the From Dusk Till Dawn movies? I looked into Spiegel briefly and noticed he was the one who directed the sequel to From Dusk Till Dawn. In that case he was playing a \\"Robert Rodriguez replacement\\" and anyone who has seen From Dusk Till Dawn and it's sequel knows that the sequel was a disaster. The first one was a good movie as produced by rodriguez and starring clooney, tarantino, Keitel, and Lewis. Therefore, it has come to my attention that not only was the hostel story passed onto new and less capable hands, but those hands have sort of a reputation for pulling botched jobs on hand-me-down films. Anyway, I just thought that if people were considering buying this based on the previous films that they should at least take these facts into consideration. Take care
B009YG2ND8|5.0|This is the best RPG on the Amazon AppStore (until FF4 comes out). Look this is a full Square RPG. You will spend about 40hrs going through this game. I see people complaining about the price, but I see xbox360 games for $60 for about 8hrs of gameplay (not counting multiplayer). I can understand if you played this on a DS (which cost $40 when it came out) or a previous system, the price might seem too much. But if you are looking for a great RPG or new to FF, don't pass this up.
B001TNGOXY|5.0|This is another favorite of mine. It never disappoints. It's a feel good movie, and you will find yourself smiling in the end.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|A quick read that keeps you turning pages. A fast brief history lesson. A good feel of living through many different difficult historical times. All the sex did not particularly add to the narrative.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|I really enjoy this item, a very fast and economic processor, if you are looking a economic and fast processor this will be your choice
B0073LWEXK|1.0|Not a good game... overly simplistic and convoluted at the same time.  And boring... I deleted the game almost immediately.
B00004TKAQ|5.0|Sound a little lacking,but still a killer album. The trip known as Calvary and Maiden of the Cancer Moon,psychedelic spanish guitar. They were a great live band.The Who do you Love Suite is great also.
B00AHSHMYW|5.0|you all know you can watch himym for free on cbs right??  You don't have to pay; it airs Monday and then it's up on CBS.com the next day.  And I think it holds like the last 5 episodes so if you missed any, you can get caught up - for free!!  You're welcome :)  [...]
0345529057|5.0|Estos libros son estupendos, el set trae los primeros 4 de la serie.<br />Es mucho mas detallado entretenerse con una buena lectura que ver como cortan la historia en la TV con rápidas adaptaciones.
B00AA7O22U|1.0|The whole Expendables 2 experience could be summed into one word... BORING!!! Let's pray that Stallone isn't given a green-light from Hollywood to film another! Expendables 2 amounts to no more than shallow acting, horrible storytelling, and extremely over exaggerated action sequences. I lost precious time and money with this movie. Consider this your warning and don't waste your precious resources either!
B0086700CM|4.0|What a fun game! I'm totally addicted to it.  It's fun, gets more challenging, has mini-challenges to strive for... and not too easy or too hard.  Lots of fun!
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Definitely an enjoyable game. Nothing like the original Oregon Trail. A good time waster indeed. Give it a try! Only downside would be the long wait times.
B008XNZMOU|5.0|some songs were crappy but my sister loved it so i cant complain alls well that ends well i guess
0553801473|4.0|La perfecta continuaci&oacute;n de la serie de libros de la Cancion de Fuego y Hielo. Espero que el siguiente libro salga pronto.
B0031YJFCQ|4.0|I have been enjoying this series, only wish that he was alive to write more.  I have been seeing the movies that go along with the series.
B009K45Y62|1.0|First off I want to start off by saying that the Dark Knight Rises was a great ending to the trilogy, and I expected nothing less from Nolan this time. And the fact that he said \\"No way Jose\\" to 3D made it that much sweeter.<br /><br />Sadly I had this limited edition Bat Cowl Blu-ray/DVD set reserved and had to cancel it due to money issues, and was looking forward to waiting until next week to re buy the product. This was going to be my Christmas present to myself. I have the collectors sets for the first 2 movies, and I collect limited and collectors editions of movies as a personal thing. So I look and see that they are sold out through Amazon, and not sold anywhere else, so I figure \\"Ok this makes sense.\\" So I look at the re-sellers, and low and behold what do I see? A limited edition item being sold for 2-10 times the retail value, and its an item that is NOT EVEN A WEEK OLD! Now there is no excuse like \\"Oh I bought it and decided I did not want it\\" for any of these re-sellers, this is pure and simple GREEDY PRICE GOUGING!<br /><br />I would think that Amazon would have limited the purchase of a Limited edition item per person, so something like this would be for the most part prevented. But sadly on both here and eBay I see pages of people selling this item for 10 times its worth not even a week has gone by since the f***ing thing came out.<br /><br />Because of this I may never shop at Amazon again, because I am sick of greedy parasites that do not buy something because they collect, or because they enjoy the product, but because they want to make money off of people. So any company that turns a blind eye to this activity does not deserve my business. I would expect this from eBay, but not Amazon.
B0081KTI0E|4.0|This show has a dark storyline, kind of depressing, but well done. Fairly slow moving, but with a surprise ending that's unsettling.
B008KPIN9C|5.0|If this isn't their best yet it's right up near the top.  Noisy, heavy, beautiful and gorgeous this is Adam and Tyson's reunion project and thank God for that.  I could write why it's good and why you should get it and blah blah blah but would that even matter?  Trust me, I hate almost all music that has ever been made and this thing is aces (as are their other albums and I'm a massive fan of Adam's solo album from a few years ago, &#34;Heights of Diamonds&#34; is an incredible song and I will fight anyone that says otherwise).  If you're on the fence, buy it.  If you've never heard Two Gallants before a) I feel sorry for you b) check out &#34;Steady Rollin&#34;, &#34;The Hand that Held Me Down&#34; and &#34;Seems Like Home to Me&#34;.  I'd say those three songs more or less encompass what they're about.  And then buy this.  You will be happy.

B0064W67IM|5.0|Cool! It was a great read. Very creative and fluid. I would recommend this book to anyone who reads graphic novels.
B0018LMZO4|5.0|Birthday boy loved it!  This is his favorite group and he didn't have this title yet, so he was very happy!
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|This movie is really action packed! Having seen the previous movies helps but is not required. (Thor, Captain America, Ironman and Hulk.) This draws together all their lives into one unit, and shows how they learn to work as a team. Very good storyline.
B0035G5IOE|5.0|Hands down my favorite Wes Anderson film and I adore his other works so much but this one I can watch over and over again time after time.  The voice acting was top notch and fleshed out the characters so much.  The making of is INCREDIBLE!
B00139XSBA|5.0|I have read and re-read this book over the years. Just a fantastic piece of work, portraying a time in American history that perhaps will never be duplicated. Wolfe's going back to the days of the test pilot and the formation of NASA gives a great back story to not only the space program's origins and an exciting and dramatic part of history, but paves the way to the question; what is the &#34;Right Stuff&#34; and who has it? Despite the length of this absolutely thorough and informative piece of literature, this epic will have you turning page after page and wishing it didn't have to end. Wolfe triumps (in my opinion) with this classic history lesson.
0525478817|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  I think I would have liked it more if it was based on real people but the author made a point to say it is NOT.
B006CQLGXG|5.0|How often can you get a much loved classic story for free? Nothing better than to see Scrooge finally take a realistic look at himself & change for the better. ENJOY!!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I was reluctant to purchase the light weight cover due to the many damning reviews. The price was down and I thought it could satisfy me. The good reviews swayed me to give it a try. Well worth it. I like the way it adds security to the already awesome protection that the Kindle Fire has. It is lightweight. I wanted the extra protection for drops and to guard the glass face plate. I think this will do the trick. I'm also pleased with the folding cover that will prop the Fire to display it. It doesn't lock into place but it sets up nicely. The securing band may wear with time but not quickly enough to make this a bad deal. With this cover I don't feel the urgency to protect the glass with a sheet of plastic, and go through those hassles.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Love the book can get enough of it can't wait to see the movie hopefully it will be like the book
B0013527I4|5.0|after borrowing this from their local library, (and sadly having to return it), i bought it for my precious grandchildren. the 2 year old's favorite show is the alice cooper halloween episode, and she sings all the songs and knows almost the whole story by heart! the kids also love loretta lynn and liberace--pleasant memories from when my children (their mom included) watched the show live!
B0027MJU00|4.0|I chose this book cause i saw it in a Women's World magazine. All i need is to read is Gone Girl...
B007HACDLK|5.0|I found Vince Flynn to be in peak performance in his Last Man. I could not put down the Kindle while reading it. It had been a while since he had anything on the market and I was deep in remorse awaiting his next. I was not disappointed when I finely received the download.<br />I don't recomend starting this book until you have time to bask in it's pages of mystery and intrigue. Mitch Rabb is his old self.
B005V2EVBQ|4.0|A friend of mine has this case for her Kindle and liked it so when I got my own I decided to get it as well. It's simple to use but feels very sturdy. Looks nice, the only slight downside is it doesn't prop up super well, but it's a minor drawback.
B002361MLA|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. Recommended for each and every person at least once in a lifetime. You really dont know what you are missing if you have not read this book.
0425263908|5.0|I loved Fifty Shades of Grey and once I finished with those I really needed something to read, these books did not disappoint, great story that keeps you wanting to read and not put it down until finished, I have pre-ordered the third book and so disappointed I have to wait unitl May to read it!
B007HACDLK|5.0|If you havent read Vince Flynn books. Now's your chance. Dont miss out on all the action. I love Mitch Rapp character. I wish Mr. Flynn the best in health. With Family & Friends. This book was all action, like all the others. But the suspense it holds in every page is worth the reading. I would recommend it. Thank you...
B00881VLCE|3.0|Would be better if we could import our own pictures as puzzles,  and it would be better if we did not have to pay for new puzzle pictures.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This one of the best books I've read in a long while. This story has had me feeling a kinds of emotions.  Totally hot hot hot
0316228532|4.0|Like anyone I've ever talked to who has read them, I loved the Harry Potter series. The story, the writing, the characters, everything was just a perfect compilation of what a fantasy book should be. Completely plausible within it's own world, great descriptions, and page-turning suspense at times, Harry Potter obviously inspired a generation to read. So, when I heard that J.K. Rowling was writing a completely non-fantasy, adult drama, I was skeptical. But, as a fan, I believed she could do it, and I was interested in seeing what she did with it. I work in a data-entry, so I have a lot of time to listen to audiobooks. Once it came out, i got the audiobook and got through it in about 2 1/2 days. And its okay. Its not amazing by any stretch, but i wasn't really expecting it to be. I came into it with a completely blank slate, because children's fantasy and adult drama are very different genre's, and i was equally prepared to be disappointed or awed that she had done it again. That said, I wasn't disappointed, but I also wasn't really impressed either.<br /><br />The book is deserving of being called 'adult', with a lot of adult subject matter and language. The story is reasonably entertaining, and is basically a tale of how one man's life impacted several people in this small town. I saw one other reviewer's opinion that there may have been too many characters introduced, too deeply, and too quickly, and i would tend to agree with that observation. I found myself a few times trying to remember which character i was reading about. By about halfway through the book though, you get a feel for the characters and their voices and this doesn't become as much of a problem. It is well written, well described, and for the most part, well thought out. When everything eventually concludes at the end, you see where everything was going and how it all ties together. I have to say, the ending is absolutely unexpected. It isn't a happy book, by any means, but it is entertaining enough.<br /><br />But is it J.K. Rowling? Honestly, I couldn't have told you if i had 20 guesses who the author was that this was written by J.K. Rowling. It is such a completely different voice than the Harry Potter series, it is amazing. The biggest thing I took away from the book was, I just couldn't believe that J.K. Rowling wrote it. It sounds incredibly like Steig Larsson, or at least the English translation of his books. And that made me think, if anyone could finish Steig Larsson's Dragon Tattoo books (as he already had outlines and details before he died) it would be J.K. Who wouldn't love to see that? That way, J.K. could get her fix of writing non-fantasy stories, and everyone could enjoy the rest of Steig Larsson's story, and it would still sound pretty much like Steig Larsson would have. I know the likelyhood of this ever happening is pretty much zero, but hey, it would be awesome.<br /><br />So, basically, it's not that long of a book, and it is fairly important as J.K. Rowling is one of the most influential authors of our time, so I would reccommend it. It is a very good window into how differently J.K. can write, and how wide of a range she has, because, lets face it, you can't get too much further away from Harry Potter than The Casual Vacancy.<br /><br />Thank you for reading my review!

0618477942|5.0|Alison Bechdel's reputation precedes her for this, her most esteemed published work. Her convoluted relationship with her father, competitive education, and semi-survivor's-guilt over his eventual death are represented in gorgeous format.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|One of the most frustrating yet peaceful games I have ever played. Great puzzle type game that expands the mind.
B00992CF6W|5.0|fantastic, any minecraft lover, would enjoy this pocket edition of the game... Graphics great and my grandson loves it, a lot of fun
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Tim Ferriss Did it again... I've used Tim's Books for both my personal and professional life and the 4 hr chef has been applied the same way.  This book is saturated with information and its a very smooth read.
B008CLI4N4|5.0|Watched this on HBO and HAD TO HAVE IT!  Such a great production, superb acting, something I will repeatedly watch over the years.<br /><br />Highly recommend for anyone that likes historical fantasy!
B002NZTZ8S|5.0|That the movie is great is a given, but Amazon included a 48 hour rental of the movie on Amazon Prime with the purchase, so it was instant gratification! Thanks, Amazon!
0312360266|5.0|Love this book! I read the series ALL the time! I'm in the process of reading Hunted for the 8th time! I'll definitely be getting that one soon too!
B004UID2LC|5.0|works great, if you love searching for videos, use this app daily enjoy that it was free too...easy to use
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is very simply written, in so much you cannot put it down. The action is on going and exciting. I cannot wait to read book two.
0375869026|5.0|The alternating points of view weren't necessary here, as Auggie's lens is the most authentic and able to characterize those around him. Sticking to the main characters, at least, would have been better, as Justin and Miranda (Auggie's sister's friends) enter the story too late for them to have their own chapter. Let's hear more from the bully, or the Principal - characters we know better. This brought to light little things we take for granted, like hearing clearly! I liked the camping escapade and the happy ending.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use evernote pretty much everyday for keeping track of errands, saving addresses, jotting down directions and random notes. The interface provides just enough organization without being fussy. Works seamlessly with my kindle Fire.
0062101897|5.0|Excellent book! A great gift for Christmas! I strongly recommend anyone to get this if you are a true Harry Potter fan!
B005S9EK1S|5.0|Got this movie for a friend and I was very impressed at how quickly it arrived and the price that it was offered! Thank you for making my Christmas shopping so easy and affordable!
B00914JWSW|5.0|Streisand's new compilation -- including never before released recordings reminds me why that voice is like buttah! She takes you on an emotional journey... souring, diving and delving into each song with amazing talent! It's like discovering her voice for the first time on \\"Release Me\\". \\"With One More Look At You\\" is very different from the track from A Star Is Born -- it has a vulnerability as yet undiscovered...
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Beautiful effects; really cool story line.  The animators outdid themselves - and the actors voicing the parts are awesome! Highly recommend.
B000FA6720|4.0|This story was so touching!! I had seen the movie but the book is more detailed & I loved it!! Made me feel as if I was there.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I just could not let it go! It's an awesome story, surprises you in every turn! It's just a fantastic book! :D
B0098WVT9W|3.0|I really like Lee's music but in this case I have to say it is quite boring. Excellent musicianship? Sure. Perhaps it was meant as background music where you aren't really supposed to notice it. None of these songs have any excitement to them. I sure wish we could get another GRP live type cd. Perhaps as musicians age they prefer playing this smooth stuff and perhaps as their audience ages they come to expect it. Not me though. I'll hold out hope that the next Lee cd will be more alive.
B007HO392S|5.0|I enjoy Carrie Underwood but I liked her older songs better  but some of the new songs are alright---I would reccommend it to anyone who appreciates country music

B000KJT8IG|5.0|Chevy Chase's best role as Clark Griswold. The bumbling well-intented Clark tries to give his family the ultimate Christmas experience but is met with one disaster after another.  Chevy is supported by an outstanding cast including the insane antic's of Cousin Eddie (Randy Quaid).  Must watch at least once every Christmas.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|Caught myself smiling while reading this book. I couldn't wait to finish it, then didn't want it to end. Story was a fun surprise.
0812993292|5.0|This is refreshing story about a man who life's prospects are dismal at the opening of the tale. He is retired from a job that filled most of his adult life, is half of a marriage which has soured, has no extended family to share life with,  has scant life savings and does not move out from his home beyond necessity. There is a lot of hidden guilt muzzling his present life which is only slowly exposed as he begins a walk to the post box and then keeps going. He sees so much as he walks along on country roads which he missed driving everywhere in a car. As spring unfolds, his emotions are gradually unlocked. He has lots of time to think through his life and he meets many people along the way...many troubled but all providing him with something...lodging, food, companionship, a small act of kindness, a smile or simply an opportunity for him to extend himself. The goal that spawned the journey provides the biggest teaching of all. That pain which has been buried so deep in his adult life is finally brought to light allowing the possibility of healing.

B0047Y0FGY|3.0|The book rambled at several points, I often didn't see the humor and it was a bit sarcastic.  But, that could be just me....
B00001QEE7|5.0|I bought to have at the house when the grand kids come over, this story is one of their favorites
B005NJU8PA|5.0|Love the part about meta-learning, Ferris is an engaging writer who definitely does his research.  His cooking tips are especially useful and I look forward to trying some of the recipes in his book.
1469984202|5.0|This book was great, I am so glad I read it with all five parts together I do not think I would have been able to handle the clif hangers at the end of some of the sections. The story was very well crafted, and creepily believable. I would suggest this to any post apocalyptic, distopian fiction lover!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I have always loved this game and to have it on my Kindle Fire HD is quite awesome. Not to mention that it was free to get my favorite game was quite awesome as well. I love it
B005721W9O|5.0|If you haven't seen it, then you've missed one of the greatest spoof movies ever produced. So BUY IT NOW. I WISH they would make a squeal!
B008AK8FHM|5.0|After reading several books recently on dying and going to heaven, I found this book more scientific and detailed.  Dr. Alexander has a gift of explaining what our neurological system is doing at and after death.  I could feel his frustration in telling his medical peers.  It is his experience and I am so glad he would share it with us.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I liked this book very much. It is an affirmation to overcoming difficulty and loss and finding love and beauty in life.
B0002Y4TTC|5.0|Based on other reviews and ratings, I was not expecting this to be as amazing as it is. It came looking brand new, no scratches or dents or tears. Just brand new, beautiful Blind Guardian. I'm very happy with this purchase!
B004QL7K6G|3.0|Wanderlust is a messy comedy that has a few bright spots, the biggest of which being Paul Rudd, who delivers some of the funniest lines the film has to offer. I'm still not completely sold on Jennifer Aniston's comedic talent as I didn't find her to be that funny. I'm not sure if that was her or the material she had to work with, which honestly wasn't that great. This one was middle of the road for me.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|Didn't really love this book. Don't want to give much away but didn't care for the personality of the &#34;narrator&#34; switching from highly evolved and intelligent to unevolved and not too perceptive, maybe even menatally ill (my perception).Wouldn't let my review stop you from reading it, I still cried so I guess it touched me in some way despite my &#34;just ok&#34; rating.
B001E5FYS8|3.0|THere is a picture book about Philip Petit which is very good.  I bought this because I heard that there was a film of him crossing between the towers.  However, the film is mostly interviews made in the early 2000's.  I wanted to show the film to the children, but there was a nude scene, so that made it unusable for children.  However, very interesting, especially about how he got interested in wire walking.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I'm a R&b listener but I absolutely loved this production. It was worth every penny. I would say this was money well spent.
B00000J048|4.0|Got this as my 2 year old's birthday present, knowing that my 4 year old would also play with it.  It can be a tad difficult to make the gears slide in on the base pieces.  The base pieces do tend to slide apart from each other with some pressure, it's not like a soild base.  But it does add flexibility that I enjoy, and the base parts coming apart isn't really a deal breaker - just push them back together and no harm is done.  It is a good gear to base ratio, I tend to have trouble getting ever single gear on the 4x4 base, so it's not like they skimp on the gears.  It is fairly trippy to watch.  My kids don't play with it as much as I thought they would, but that's not really the fault of the toy.  They do like to help me put the pieces on -they usually need help positioning because they like to put them where the gears aren't touching, but I reposition them and then they can push them in on their own.  They like to spin it around and around and watch for a few minutes.  But this isn't really a toy they can play with independently yet.  But we do like playing with it together and I foresee them growing into this toy in a few years.  Until then it's still a fun toy for the price, quality, and I think it will last for quite a while.
B0091HVMVO|5.0|Back in the 1970s, Odyssey Records was located on Union Square in San Francisco. It is there that I sated my emerging appetite for classical albums. Walking into the vast store, entire walls were lined with the latest release from the major labels (domestic sale price $5.98 and imports, like Philips a couple of dollars more). There were two things that struck me about Philips albums. First, their covers - elegant, very European, and sometimes a little off-putting (Alfred Brendel or Claudio Arrau staring into the camera, looking somewhat unapproachable). Other times, the albums contained stunning images - most notably the paintings by Edvard Munch that were used for Colin Davis' Sibelius cycle with the BSO (a cycle shockingly without representation in this box set, as it introduced an entire generation to this great composer).<br /><br />It was the second thing about Philips' releases that struck me the most - and that was the characteristic Philip's sound. It was beautiful - full, spacious, deep, resonant, and extremely truthful. Therefore, it comes as no surprise that this box is emblazoned with Philips' motto: \\"Obsessed With Sound\\". They were, and remain so. That is the single characterisitic that unites this eclectic grouping of performances. With rare exception - particularly the Gardiner/Verdi/Requiem which remains somewhat congested. The chamber performances in particular, shine. All of Arrau's performances - including the many that are not incuded here, are recorded in some of the most life-like sound I have ever heard - as true in their CD incarnations as it was in their original LP releases.<br /><br />Reviewer HT (above) gets it right, although we do disagree on that Verdi Requiem (see the comments). Most performances are excellent, if not definitive. I have certainly enjoyed re-acquainting myself with many of the performances, Accardo's Bruch on Disc 1, Haitink's Bruckner 3rd, Lloyd Webber's cello performances, Norman's extraordinary Strauss recital, the Vivaldi Chamber Works with Holliger, Haskil's Mozart, Ameling's lieder recital &lt;sigh>, Kocsis' Bartok, Kovecevich and Argerich during happier times - the list goes on and on.<br /><br />But why De Waart's Mozart? Why no Colin Davis Sibelius? Why so little Arrau (not that I mind - I have all of his Philips discs, and the selected Brahms 2nd - though not to everyone's taste - is regal and resplendant if not supercharged with excitement). And Neville Marriner - that 70s stalwart of college student listening rarely rises above metronomic competence. And what about Brendel? Revered retired elder, or second tier performances without individualistic character? I won't enter that amazon fray - but I will say that I regret the inclusion of his Liszt, and the exclusion of his Haydn.<br /><br />But these are minor cavils. Philps selection is eclectic, more interesting I think than its Decca predecessor - and currently a bargain in it early phase of sales. Whether an introduction, or re-introduction to the golden age of analogue to digital - these are re-cordings to cherish. No one building a library, or adding to a library, will regret owning this set.<br /><br />This is music for the ages. Metadata be damned.<br /><br />(to be continued.....I've just noticed that the contents did not paste in from Word accurately - will return to this post in the next day or so to correct this. I just couldn't leave this set all weekend with a cumulative rating of only 3 1/2 stars due to unmusical meta-man's meandering bon-mots of minutiae. Gosh - that was fun to write :)<br /><br />Enjoy!!<br /><br />1. Concerto for Violin no 1 in G minor, Op. 26 by Max Bruch<br />2. Concerto for Violin no 2 in D minor, Op. 44 by Max Bruch<br />3.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I am already physically fit and this helped to tighten up some of the spots that were bothering me. Jillian is great!
B006LSZECO|4.0|Very good read, couldn't put it down.  It is a real page-turner, good plot, good twists and turns in the story.  Likeable characters.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Love the show, it's the best comedy on TV these days. Without all the vuglar talk. Laugh out aloud kind of show.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This was an a downloaded Kindle book. Displays very nicely and is easy to read.  Do I need to say anymore???????
B006L0A5P8|5.0|This great cross-platform app has allowed me to completely turn off all browser &#34;remember password&#34; and autofill functions - on my tablets, phones, PCs and Macs - and use this one app to store all of my login information, as well as account info, software serial numbers, etc. I hope my perception that this is a safer way to go is correct. In any case, it's a wonderful-functioning app and works simply and flawlessly on all platforms.
B007T2XC7A|3.0|Okay.  Sounded a lot like her other work.  I like Norah, but this didn't seem like anything exceptional for her.
B008DM4OTA|5.0|In this game, children get to become the doctor and help the sick animals get well.  My four year old and even my eight year old have enjoyed playing this game.  Lots of smiles when the animals are all better!
B008HK3XU4|5.0|This cover is sturdy, looks nice, no complaints at all. I would recommend it if you want to protect your kindle fire HD.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|A handy little utility fo r those of us who want to know how our battery is doing. Lots of info and nice graphs ... and yes the battery on a new kindle fire 2 does last  about 8-10 hr when browsing the web.
0321714113|3.0|It was not a lucky day to open this book.<br />I was interested to read some material on variadic templates, then opened this book on §16.4. Variadic Templates.<br />To my surprise I've found this right in the beginning:<br /><br />void foo ( const string&, const int&, const char[3]& );<br />void foo ( const char[3]& );<br /><br />I can't stand with a book in its 5th edition containing such a fundamental errors.<br />Declaring variables is basic stuff. Such a mistakes make me refrain and suspect how good the authors are in the subject matter.<br /><br />No compiler would accept that stuff, it should have been:<br /><br />void foo ( const string&, const int&, const char (&)[3] );<br />void foo ( const char (&)[3] );<br /><br />*Sigh*<br /><br />--EDIT--<br /><br />Section \\"3.5.1 Defining and Initializing Built-in Arrays\\" more or less, leads to the right direction for that correct declaration, although it doesn't generalize the concept as I'd like...<br /><br />See for example \\"Thinking in C++, Complicated declarations & definitions\\" or K&R: \\"Each declarator is taken to be an assertion that when a construction of the same form as the declarator appears in an expression, it yields an object of the indicated type and storage class\\"

B008YWY0HK|5.0|The DVD was purchased as I had seen the previews on the TV it was at the theaters. Due to my work schedule, I can rarely find the time to go to a move. Since we love the computer animated DVDs, we just had to order this one. Although we still have not time to watch it at home, we are looking to finding an evening where our family will be able to watch it together.
B0087HT36U|4.0|I like it a lot. Definitely worth .99 .... There are a few quirks but over all an enjoyable game.
B000E41MS6|5.0|What an amazing way to bring back a classic show!  Chris Eccleston is mesmerizing, and Billie Piper is great as the audience surrogate in this reimagining of Doctor Who.  Each episode in this series is imaginative and funny, taking a character well known in British pop culture and continuing his story in the 2000s for a new generation.  Remember, though, that this series was made in 2005 on a TV budget.  The CGI isn't the best though it's infinitely better than the very cheap model work and compositing done on the original show.  The cameras used to film this weren't great either which gives a grainy, murky texture to darker scenes.<br /><br />This DVD set is a great way to own all of Eccleston's episodes.  The slipcover might get set aside if you watch it a lot, but it's still a clever way of packaging the show.  There are tons of special features including all of Doctor Who Confidential for the season, videos Billie Piper made on the set, and deleted scenes.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|this really does help when I need to wake up for school and to time me for reading.  you really should get this app it will help you as it did for me.
B004G600A4|5.0|The DVD was purchased as our family had seen it in the movies and we enjoyed it so much, we decided to purchase it so that our family could watch it over and over again. It's a great family film.
B009VSW15Y|5.0|It works like it is supposed to. It is easy to use.  The price is very good.  It is a video camera too.
B0009P5YXO|4.0|Unfortunately, I found this cheaper at FYE last week, but I had already bought it months ago.  This is a great prop, in scale with a typical adult.  I love the UV light on the end though I wish the pen end weren't removable simply because I'm afraid it will fall off one day and get lost.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Patricia Cornwell is getting a bit too predictable.  The last few of her books have seemed all too similar to me, and I'm getting tired of the same old themes.  I loved her early books, but I probably won't be buying any more.  She's a great writer; I think she's just in a rut and keeps writing because her books sell, but they won't if she doesn't get a fresh look.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I didn't take to this game at first, but when I stared playing again, I got hooked. It's fun to see the different combinations of dragons that you get when breeding them.
B0086DBE62|4.0|Julia Roberts is truly a memorable witch!  This is a entertaining, fun twist on a fairy tale.  The perfect diversion when you want to simply want to enjoy popcorn and a fun movie.
B004NJC0B6|3.0|This dvd version of the concert was no better than the VHS.  Some parts of the concert had blue streaks across the screen.<br /><br />Can anyone tell me if they think certain parts of this concert were redone in the studio?
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great first-hand account.  I believe this story more than the one the press is pushing.  I'm thankful he wrote it!  And thankful for the brave men of Seal Team 6 for all the things they do and don't tell us about.
B005BCE7FQ|4.0|We have this film on DVD already bought the 3-D version and it's excellent my 5, 3 and seven-year-old love it
B00A72989U|5.0|This is an amazing piece of work.  The voice and writing of the songs is truly worthy of the title.
B00102FELM|4.0|What a great set list/concert.<br /><br />I do agree with everyone about the multiple camera angles.  It makes no sense.<br /><br />If you want to see a great Heavy Metal Concert.....I would highly recommend the new CD release of Judas Priest's Screaming Vengeance.  It includes their 1983 show at US Festival on DVD.  Awesome!
B001TODCII|4.0|I would have rated it 3 1/2 stars if I could.  The movie was mostly linear tracking from daughter getting kidnapped to Liam Neeson killing everyone that gets in his way to get his daughter back.  The action was well done but unrealistic and unbelieveable.  It was fun to watch the first time but when watching it again, not the kind of movie I want to sit and go through all over because it leaves you thinking that it was not really well written.  It is barely worth keeping for my movie collection but doubt I will keep it for long.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Love string instruments and they are an inspiration -- Love watching their videos with the music. Very talented group-- music and production !
B007EE564U|5.0|I have read all Vince Flynn's novels and this one won't disappoint.  I could not put it down once I had started reading. Highly recommend.
B00006WKY9|5.0|What more can you say...except BUY IT<br /><br />Anything from Love at First String back to Lonesome Crow is a recommended buy.<br /><br />Can we please get a proper DVD release of live scorps.......say.......US Festival 83 and maybe some 1970's concerts on DVD also.
B00003CXDV|5.0|There should be more of these kinds of films out there--heads up for those that are looking for something new to produce.  I like that alternative setting that this movie takes over the standard Star Trek/Star Wars.  Funny but with a serious plot.  Enjoyed it from the beginning to the end.
B00A77II0U|5.0|One  of the best games I've played so far!  If you like puzzles this one's for you.<br />Storyline was fantastic.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Love pinterest and I love this app for kindle fire. Loads fast and easy to pin items. No problems yet.
B008BO61BE|5.0|I highly recommend this heavy metal &#34;moment in time celluloid&#34; before it is taken away.<br /><br />Positives:<br />1.  concert looks unedited....just like it was in 1983.<br />2.  limited camera angles:  why can't concerts still be done this way?<br />3.  daytime concert:  after watching this and J P Live Vengeance 82...it is like night and day.  The Live Vengeance is very dark in places (good old arena concerts) and has some cheesy special effects at times.  Priest at US Festival......perfect camera views....perfect picture...no need to lights and perfect sound as far as I'm concerned.<br /><br />Negative:<br />1.  how about some live Priest (DVD) PRE 1980?<br /><br />I would like to personally thank whoever was responsible for getting this released.<br /><br />Now how about getting Van Halen, Ozzy and the Scorps to do the same.<br /><br />There's money to be made here people!
B004SIP6ZE|5.0|It is well written and love seeing Brandon Lee in action.  It was unfortunate this was his last one.  I see so much potential in Brandon in making it big.  Unfortunate concerning his death.  It is the only The Crow movie I recommend.
B00003CX9Q|4.0|It only took me 30 years to finally see this film. I don't know why this movie has alluded me all these years; it's almost embarrassing, and almost comparable to someone never seeing Star Wars. Well, the wait was worth it, as this movie is an emotional experience that's also filled with humor and charm. While watching this movie, it almost felt like I was watching Home Alone, as it has that 'family feel' to it. Now, I must honestly say that this movie is maybe a tad overrated. Perhaps my opinion stems from watching the movie for the first time ever in 2012? Does it not resonate the same way it may have if I saw it in 1982? I don't know, but I can't give this movie 5 stars; it's overly simplistic, and maybe a little predictable at times. To say that this movie is the greatest science fiction movie of all time is a gross overstatement. Still, I enjoyed this film, and approached it with an open mind. This is definitely a kids/family movie that still manages to hold the viewer's attention. 8/10.
B00881VLCE|5.0|this game is pretty swaggity swagg swagg and i enjoy playing this swagg game. yes. swag. so much of it. swagg
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Ok, I confess, I read it, and the sequel.  If you are into BDSM you will probably like it more than I did. Not a lot of substance besides hot sex scenes.
B000003TSP|5.0|Portishead is not my favorite but for them, I think this is their best album.  I like trip hop chill and this album fits it perfectly.  Decent singing in an eerie setting.
B007M45PMU|5.0|I can't stop listening to it. The album flows very well from song to song, and all of the songs are listenable.
B004EPZ07K|3.0|When I purchased Green Lantern in 2011 it was receiving generally poor reviews and was the butt of many jokes. So I set it on a shelf and didn't watch it until yesterday, more than a year later. I was pleased to find that I didn't think the movie was nearly as bad as many of the reviews I had read indicated. Certainly there are weak spots, in my opinion, the ending (vanquishing the villian) probably at the top of that list. However, this was an origin story and as such had a lot of ground to cover. Just like with Spiderman, Superman, Captain America, Batman etc. Much of the movie is spent simply establishing the basics from which the story and any subsequent sequels will elaborate. Overall, I thought it was all right and a good popcorn movie, worth 2 hours. Certainly better than anything you might typically find surfing the TV channels for the same period of time.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|As with all the Rick Riordan books that my kids have read, this is a favorite.  The series is exciting and educational (without them realizing it!)  I am a teacher and I value that :)  My girls liked it so much that it has been put on my list as well as a favorite. Way to go R. Riordan!
B00006FDCJ|5.0|The movie play was much better than expected especially the ending.  Getting an old man to return to the ruthless killer in his earlier lawless days was awesome considering he at his old age became a fumbling clumsy somebody.  One of his best movies!
0446547646|5.0|Great book and surprise ending !  You really get to know the characters - you are not just introduced to them. I have only read one other Sparks book but will definitely be buying some more for this book was so good - and really easy reading with lots of emotions.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars if not for the abrupt and disappointing ending...I just thought/wanted there to be more.
0316228532|1.0|Because the book arrived dirty, and I'm just disgusted.  It seems like somebody with dirty hands who was eating potato chips must have handled it.  NOT what I expect in a new book!  It makes me wonder if Amazon is just going down the tubes. I do want to read it, maybe after I've gotten around to washing it.  But I'm busy resenting the condition of it right now.  Yuck!
B000IOM1YG|5.0|I think this is the best of Alan Parson's albums.  The singing and the instrumentation was first rate.  If you are an Alan Parsons fan, you have to have this one.
B002PEP4SC|4.0|I like watching the TV show Castle and when I saw that they actually made books that go along with the show I figured I would see what they were about.  I wasn't expecting a masterpiece by any means and I just bought it out of curiosity.  Saying that, I do not regret buying this and will probably buy others eventually.  Honestly, the book held my attention and the villain wasn't super obvious.  Just don't put a lot of expectation into these books.  They were written by a fake author on a TV show.
B0000000LI|5.0|Yanni working in his studio alone is okay, but.... nothing I'd write home about. Take those same pieces, though, and add the energy of this particular orchestral performance, and WOW!!!! I haven't found anything to touch this performance and recording -- even Yanni's other live performances.
B0016J81B4|5.0|The shoes arrived in a few days after ordering.  They fit perfectly.  I like the lack of holes -- no sand getting on and in my socks anymore, like with my other crocs.  Nice color, light to wear, fit fine, what else is there to say?  I'm happy.
B000X2H8G4|5.0|My mother is VERY hard of hearing and this has helped us have a conversation.  Even though she wears a hearing aid she still has trouble understanding me.  With this device on her word comprehension is much improved.
B007HOOAH6|3.0|I think that this book would be better in the hardback instead of the electronic version.  This book's illustration does not 'fit' on my ipad screen so it looks a bit off.  But, my son has had me read it to him a few times now so as far as the book goes it was cute enough.  He cracks up especially when the little kid leaves his diaper on when sitting on the toilet.  I recommend buying the hardbook instead of the electronic copy though.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I love love love this game! It is so cute and so much fun. The game play is easy and the story line fits MLP. Any brony or pegasister would enjoy this game. I definitely reccomend it.
1936608618|5.0|This book is fantastic. It is mainly step by step pictures for all kinds of exercises. If you are a triathlete, cyclist or crossfiter you need this book. This book will help get you strong and prevent injury. It is one of the most complete books I own.
B009SQOGZ2|5.0|paranorman was so scary and cool. I T WAS GREAT FOR PARENTS AS WELL AS KIDS.<br /><br /> mom loved it too.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This latest offering by Vince Flynn is a page turner from start to finish. For me I know I love a book when I hate nearing the end and I just don't want to finish the book. I highly recommend this book as it has a bit of everything in it and leaves room for several of the main characters to reappear in a future book. I have read every book Vince Flynn has written and he just keeps getting better and better. I give this book a five star rating because I had trouble putting it down and I compare it to a fine red wine that just gets better and better as you savor it.
B001RNO7BM|4.0|This was the perfect waterproof, low top boot that looked more like a shoe than a hiking boot. You can wear it around town and on hikes and is perfect for traveling in the tropics or Europe.  Unfortunately the lip on the right side of the right shoe caught my ankle bone and I had to return it.  But the other shoe fit perfect and wish I could have found a way to make it fit.
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|Good movie, great theme, mothers and daughters will love it!! The animation is fantastic - love the fact that she's bold and adventurous - a good role model for other girls.
B006O6FK2W|4.0|As good a toy as any of these super-hero products can possibly be.. My young nephew will love receiving it/
B002APU580|5.0|I had always heard wonderful things about this movie. I finally got around to watching it on Amazon streaming. I loved the movie and will watch it again.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|My stock cpu cooler fan stopped working in an older PC, and I bought this as a replacement. When it arrived, I was worried that it wouldn't fit in my midtower case, but it was fine.<br /><br />The instructions are a little sparse, and took some deciphering (think Ikea furniture instructions, but with very, very tiny pictures).  They have one diagram that shows which way the mounting arms are supposed to be, and I couldn't figure out from the small drawing which was the good way and which wasn't.  I just did a &#34;dry run&#34; of the install and it became clear which way the bracket should go.<br /><br />One thing to note is that this cooler is mounted via screws that go through the mounting arms, through the motherboard and then to a bracket that sits on the backside of the motherboard.  So if you are used to the kind of coolers with those nylon push-in clips, then know that you are going to need access to the back of your motherboard to mount this.  For me, that meant taking the motherboard out of the case, as there is no access panel on my case.<br /><br />Since install, the fan is humming along nice and quietly, and my CPU temps are roughly 10 degrees C cooler than they were previously. While a little fiddly, the mounting system won't come off except in the case of a bomb going off, which I am liking, even though it was more effort. I've had those nylon push-in cooler clips come loose and it's near-impossible for this cooler to come loose and fry the CPU.<br /><br />Since I spent as much time trying to figure out the directions as I did actually installing the cooler, I docked one star for the fairly crappy instructions.
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Not an Academy Award film, but lovely nonetheless. How can you lose with such excellent actors? Definitely fun to rent.
B005V2EVBQ|3.0|Kind of a stupid thing to buy since I have a Nexus 7, but it was labeled as a case for it when I ran a search. I bought it because I loved the look. Other than it not fitting, it was actually a pretty good case (sturdy build, nice grip, and makes a pretty good stand/glove). If I ever get a Kindle I will definitely grab this case.
0823004325|5.0|Another good book for getting the expressions correctly for my characters. I use it mostly for the carving and painting that I do.
B007PPE086|5.0|I ordered this doll because of it's Gothic Look. Not really to use as a toy.<br />As a child I would have loved a doll like this being artistic but I don't think it's one to rough house with.<br />I think it's a great gift, if your child is collecting dolls and knows not to toss it around.<br />I also have the Lagoona Blue Doll and I would recommend this one over Lagoona because her fin keeps falling out of the leg.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|good very interesting and worth the money its like its supposed to be background details I prefer reading this book after all them or before the first one
0345529057|5.0|I bought these for myself, but then gave it to my friend as a gift and got myself a digital copy so I can read them anywhere. They are great books and will draw you in with their characters and story.
B005HSL626|5.0|My niece had me to install this game on my phone and now I play all the time. It is fun and it requires concentration. I have not been able to score too high (493) but I enjoy playing. Slicing the fruit when it comes up fast is challenging. Elaine
B004XVN1T4|5.0|I enjoy all of Follett's books.  They keep my interest on every page and I find them hard to put down. I think men, especially,would enjoy this book.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Some of the concepts in this movie are a step above the other two (unlimited possibilities and the like) however the formula is pretty much the same. Brolin does a great job as the younger Tommy Lee - spot on.  will was , well...Will he does that - well.  Glad I didn't spend the extra bucks but waited for the rental
B007EECSFA|5.0|As always Kate Morton has given us another great read.  I don't even have to read a book jacket anymore, all I have to do is see her name on the book and I know I'm going to enjoy this read.  She has never disappointed me.  Every one of her books is so good, all of them page turners. I have lost count of how many times I have recommened one of her books to friends and family.  This book was no exception, good from start to finish.  Thank you Kate!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The writing is inventive, the characters memorable, many with a touch of the Dickensian.  Zusak masterfully slips appropriate comic relief into one of the most tragic stories in history.  This historical novel is truly hard to put down and you may find yourself reading for a good deal longer than you intended.  The Book Thief is a character and a book readers won't soon forget.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|Not being a dog lover, I found the emotions  and story told by a dog a bit far-fetched.  A pet owner and dog-lover would have more insight and probably relate to this story more readily.
0385342055|1.0|I loved this series when I was in high school and early college. Now at 24, it seems so silly. The plot of the shopaholic series is always the same. Becky is drowning in debt, lying to her friends and family and doing ridiculous things that no one in real life would ever do. Definitely not a 29 year old mother. It would be nice if in one book, she learned her mistake with moeny and found a good way to manage it. She is a disgrace to women everywhere. VERY DISSAPOINTED. Character should've matured and grown over the years.
B000SW2ER2|1.0|Absolutely laughable!  Clooney plays a nauseating-self-absorbed \\"psychiatrist\\" called light yrs. Away by an old-equably laughable stooge to check on a gum-chewing meth-head-a paranoid black feminist-only to de plagued by his Russian bull-dike ex-wife-who he puts in the air-lock to float forever- BUT there she is..horses***-but do not be dismayed..Justin bieber's mom signed him for a sequel!
B008SVFX96|5.0|This CD is explosive high energy with kickin guitar. Sambora showcased his talent on this one as an accomplished songwriter and guitar player. I enjoyed all of the songs on the CD, and I just want to hear it over and over again. If you do not own a copy, you are missing out.
1846556007|5.0|This is a great book as are the other 7. I have read them all now and this is the first of the series, which I read last but remains, as do all his books, one of the best book/books I have read.  As with all his books, I read them in 3 days and well into the early morning in most cases.
0385342039|2.0|This was a fun light read inbetween real books. However, I have found Sophie Kinsella's book to be a typical rom com movie, the really bad ones. Its always so unrealistic, the ghost. You can predict the whole story less than half way into the book. That's not a good sign.
B009VB97EY|1.0|Hot men do not make up for an extremely shallow plot and bad acting. Spend your time and money elsewhere...
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Everything I have read by Ken Follett has been very good.  I enjoy historical fiction, and this was s good read.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a little slow at the beginning of I should said almost half the book was slow compared to the first two but at the end it was with it
B00AJGCZZ8|5.0|great new tv superheroes show perfect casting for amell and well hopes to see more of this tv series on cw
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I really like it because it is challenging. I am glad thatI bought it I wil be passing the word along.
B000VZYPB4|5.0|This really is the best sitcom on TV these days and destined to become a classic like Seinfeld.  If you've not watched it, take a look.  The characters have really matured over the seasons and the on screen chemistry improvements really add quite a bit of depth to the show.  It also has just the right balance of geek humor as is spills into popular culture.
B008J05EL8|1.0|I bought this for almost five dollars, and it won't even let me open it. I shouldn't have had to buy an additional app to modify my Word docs.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Exceptional look at History and Mr Lincoln.  I am a civil war buff and this is a fascinating read.  21 out of 22 of my relatives that served in the Army of Northern Virginia did not return.  The 3 first  born sons my great aunt's family all died on the same afternoon at &#34;New Hanover Courthouse&#34; in Virginia.  The only one who did return was my great, great grandfather who was the eighth man to pick up the battle flag at Gettysburg during &#34;Pickett's charge&#34; and was promptly wounded in the head for his trouble.  He was a 41 year old private who was finally discharged home in 1864 because he was to weak and unfit to fight on.  None of these young North Carolina Mountain boys ever thought of &#34;owning a slave&#34;.  Contrary to the southern opinion of &#34;defense of states rights&#34; that I was taught and read, it was all about slavery, and little else.  How far from its moorings and founding fathers is the current Republican Party??
B009MO5ES8|5.0|If you like cycling, this is a great movie. Continuous bike action throughout. (Not sure the plot would win any awards)
1609611543|1.0|This book was pretty decent. I have been gluten free for 2 years so it wasn't a huge splash for me. Gave some good scientific info to back up gluten free info that I have been learning on my own.<br /><br />However, I found it to be extremely OFFENSIVE and ARROGANT of the Dr. to say that Haight Ashbury is like crack. On page 44 of his book Wheat Belly, the sentence reads \\"Wheat is Crack. Wheat is the Haight Ashbury of foods\\".<br /><br />This just does not make sense.<br /><br />First of all, Haight Ashbury is a RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOOD. Not a drug. Logically that doesn't work.<br /><br />Secondly, crack cocaine was big in the 80s. Haight Ashbury was well known in the 60s for LSD having the capacity to provide mind expansion. Different drug, sir.<br /><br />Third, no one ever buys crack in the Haight, when it's a well known fact it is always purchased in the Tenderloin. (JUST KIDDDING!)<br /><br />I left a comment to this fact that was erased from his blog. Then it was erased from his Facebook pages, as well as no response given to my message to him.<br /><br />Sir, you are a coward. Your book is just OK and you make yourself to be some self important person when really you can't even handle a little criticism. Not everyone is going to like your attitude or your book.<br /><br />And you sound uneducated and untraveled. Try not to offend an entire neighborhood, where most likely the mind expansion happening there was what led to people discovering that gluten is bad for them in the first place.<br /><br />Is Peace & Love like Wheat? According to your logic, yes.<br /><br />Please remove this from your next edition as it is false and makes it difficult to read the rest of your book knowing you have such outlandish biases about things.

B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Tedious riff on a comic book character.  Anne Hathaway is good.  Christian Bale, was, well, Christian Bale.  Reminded me of Escape from New York, but not as entertaining.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I recommend it 100 percent is really good quality and you can say that of the best I've had. thank
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|The 3D effects are great.<br />It's not really SciFi<br />It might be considered religious allegory<br />If there's a distinction (non-theistic?) then perhaps it's an updated/reworked Myth- after all that's the title, isn't it?
B001U887MO|2.0|This product runs 1 to 2 sizes too small.  I was so disappointed to find that the liner made them very tight.  I am just going to give them to a friend
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|If you liked the first two series of the Hunger Games, you will love the final one.  You'll find out who survives and who doesn't and all through the book you can't wait for the ending to find who survives and who doesn't.  I loved the characters in the book going all though each series and reading all three books is a must.  If you think you won't like this you will.  It's just a different kind of series of books.  I wish there was a fourth book and that this could go on and on.
B00000IQW5|5.0|Got this for a gift as person has family that lives in and around area filmed. She loved it, so I purchased one for me.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This is a long movie; this is a complex movie.<br />This is a satisfying capstone to the trilogy<br />I just wish it were in 3D
B000URWYTS|4.0|although it happens alot more now, back then it was just unheard of for a woman to leave a seemingly good husband and abandon her children to take off with another woman's husband.  2 vapid souls absorbed in their intellectualism abandon their families for an extramarital affair and trapse across Europe.  I didn't know much about Frank Lloyd Wright or his affair with Mamah before I read this book.  I got very curious halfway through and googled him.  After reading about it, it was a tad easier not to hate Mamah. But the fact that the book raised my ire as it did is probably a sign that this was a really good book!
