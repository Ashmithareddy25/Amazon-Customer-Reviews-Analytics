0316228532|5.0|I was skeptical about getting this book because 1) I am a die-hard Harry Potter fan and I was afraid that this just wouldn't be it. 2) I had heard from friends who had already started reading that it was just not good and they couldn't get into the book and story. So I started read. And I was pleasantly surprised. Yes, this book is nothing like Harry Potter but I like that she branched out so much. She gives a depth to these characters that actually left me with some tears in the end. If you are looking for an in-depth look into how a tragedy can affect people in different ways, then this is your book.
B00005KHEU|4.0|First released in early Summer of 1979, featured more of a disco influence and was the first of the band's albums to be a quartet with no violin or cello players in the band. Jeff had jettisoned Mik, Hugh and Melvyn before the recording sessions although they do appear in the videos.  The strings on here were added with an orchestra conducted by Louis Clark. Incidentally, for anyone else who happens to dig Everybody Loves Raymond, that's Brad Garrett dressed up on the back cover in one of his first jobs.<br /><br />The album opens with the heavy beat of the disco influenced Shine A Little Love complete with some cool guitar fills. Confusion turns down the disco groove with a catchy melody and some cool keyboard work. Need Her Love has always reminded me of The Beatles' Something. The Diary Of Horace Wimp is quite an unusual song. The second half starts off with another heavily disco influenced number called Last Train To London. Midnight Blue is a nice ballad while On The Run really picks up the pace and reminds me of an ELO song from an earlier time. On the other hand, Wishing sounds very 1979 but in a good way. Don't Bring Me Down closed the album in a rocking groove and ended up becoming the biggest hit on the album. The bonus songs are made up of two short fragments of demos and a cool cover of Del Shannon's Little Town Flirt.

B008OJ291W|4.0|First, what I find to be the flaws here: The sound is somewhat compressed sounding and it's pretty much straight re-recordings with not too much difference between the originals. The title could be misleading to people who don't know that these are re-recordings. Finally, the disc is fairly short by cd standards and it bothers me that they didn't include Twilight from the Japan version and the four additional songs that you have to buy on iTunes if you want them. As far as what is here: it's quite good and Jeff began recording these back in 2001 perhaps planning to include some as bonus songs on the remasters of the original albums or box sets. Think Xanadu on Flashback. I'm glad Jeff didn't do what some artists have done and included these on the original albums as the default versions. Here we get them issued as alternative versions. All the songs here are certainly a nice listen and for me, it's worth having.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book was one of the best things I read in a long time. I have not enjoyed a book this much since I read the Ender's Game series. The author did an amazing job at this one and look forward to any new books which may come next.
B0087ITC56|4.0|FLIGHT is a gripping & well-made movie that has far less to say than it thinks it does (I felt much the same about CLOUD ATLAS...only that movie's \\"point\\" was even more mundane considering the effort spent in making it).  Robert Zemeckis is a consistently solid director, pushing technical boundaries and giving us complex characters.  Whether BACK TO THE FUTURE or CAST AWAY (to name just a couple), he knows how to make truly entertaining movies.  I've never spent a boring time in one of his films.  But FLIGHT is clearly reaching to do more than entertain, and this is where it fell short.  I was WELL entertained, but not terribly enlightened.<br /><br />Whip Whitaker (Denzel Washington) is a pilot who apparently frequently comes to work drunk.  He's a \\"functional\\" alcoholic, but we meet him shortly before his next flight, and get a quick sense of how much booze and cocaine he is pouring into his system.  But flying is so second-nature to him that he's not having any issues flying safely.  But on THIS flight, things go wrong.  The plane has a colossal failure and begins to plummet to the ground.  Whitaker executes an amazing maneuver (I won't spoil it for you in case you haven't seen the trailer for the film), and brings the plane down in spectacular fashion.  (Zemeckis never skimps on the effects in his films).  Whitaker is injured, and when he awakens in the hospital, he discovers he is a national hero.<br /><br />There's also the uncomfortable fact that the routine blood-alcohol test that was run on him while he was out shows he was enormously drunk.  I don't remember the exact number, but it was something like 0.24 (about 3 times the normal legal level).  There is no doubt he was not operating optimally.  There is no doubt that no one else could have brought the plane down safely.  There is little doubt that the fact that the plane failed at all had NOTHING to do with \\"pilot error.\\"<br /><br />Essentially, the film is an exploration of alcoholism.  Whitaker is a \\"deep\\" alcoholic.  His private life has been destroyed by his drinking.  He is enabled by co-workers who see what a great pilot he is.  And during this crisis, he is aided in hiding his affliction because the consequences of discovery by the world at large are pretty heft for the pilot's union, the airline, etc.  We get many chances to see Whitaker drinking a great deal.  And we watch the evolution of his character...his journey to the realization that he is an alcoholic.<br /><br />This subject has been explored MANY times before.  There is no question that Washington gives one of the most powerful modern depictions of the ravages of alcohol & drug abuse.  It's certainly one of his best performances in a career full of them, because he is well and truly the star of the film.  Lots of close-ups.  Lots of scenes with JUST Washington in them...and he commands them all.  He is never to be over-shadowed (except in a couple of amusing scenes with John Goodman as his old friend and supplier).  Certainly the psychological journey he goes through is compelling viewing.<br /><br />But FLIGHT tries to overlay this journey onto the much grander story of the plane crash.  It APPEARS to be morally or ethically complex, but it really isn't.  Stripped away of all the legal maneuverings and NTSB investigations...it's the story of an alcoholic.  There is no question that Whitaker's actions were heroic...and there is no question that this man is a danger to himself and others.  The only ethical conflict, really, is the fact that the viewer is inclined to root for this guy to \\"get away with it\\" because we've spent so much quality time with him.  So one could argue we are complicit in the attempt to enable Whitaker vicariously...but frankly, when you've got an actor as charismatic as Washington, how can you not want things to work out for him?  I hardly felt my conscience stirring because I was somehow crossing my fingers for him.<br /><br />However, let me say again that the film (despite this serious shortcoming, or overreaching, if you will) is highly entertaining.  Washington is great.  Goodman is hilarious.  Don Cheadle is extremely compelling in his small role.  Bruce Greenwood does solid work.  And best of all in the supporting cast is the relatively unknown Kelly Reilly as a heroin addict who forms a nice, textured relationship with Washington.  Their scenes are probably the best in the film.  The movie is well-paced, often quite tense, frequently quite funny and technically immaculate.  I give it 4 stars, because it is solid & stolid entertainment.  The missing star is for the failed attempt to force something onto this already good story that simply isn't there.te this serious shortcoming, or overreaching, if you will) is highly entertaining.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Couldn't put this book down.  I must say, it was one of the best books I've read in a long time that isn't about Vampires or other monsters.....Loved the whole series
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is one of my favorite fiction programs via PBS, and find the story and acting exceptional.  This is definitely worth a look for good entertainment.  Very good location shots, and wardrobe for this time period.  I am totally into 3D and wish all programs should have a choice of 2D or 3D so people with 3D television smart sets can enjoy that extra dimention.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Very Good Reading!  Please bring on a few sequels so we can keep track of the children.  Can't get enough of Fifty
B009KHBDUU|2.0|Dark shadows was amusing, but could have been funnier.  Good as a rental; glad I didn't pay theater prices to see it.
B007L3BMGA|2.0|The story is weak, the characters unbelievable and unrealistic. I'm sure this book was written for (virgin?)teenagers. On the second date, Gray takes the virgin Ana to his appartment and introduces her to his \\"room of pain\\" - this should be enough to make any virgin run for her life! Gray is just too perfect!!! This guy has money, is talented, is good looking, etc. The sex is also unrealistic and I think if people take this book literally, they will be disappointed when it comes to the \\"real thing\\". This book should be classified as \\"Erotic Fantasy\\".
B008FYZIVY|5.0|Perhaps one of the very few who never saw Upstairs, Downstairs, this series reminds me of what that series must have been about. I love period dramas that fold into the larger historical situation. This series is full of them, tying in seamlessly to the sinking of the Titanic, the coming of electricity and motorcars, early women's rights movement. and WWI (so far - looks like the Depression will make an appearance in series 3).<br /><br />This is my favorite type of series because though it is mindful of the history its characters are living through, all of the main characters are fictional - so there's no specific history to get upset modern screenwriters fail to take into account. Here were some striking things to me...<br /><br />1) As tragic as we still feel the sinking of the Titanic was, the series gives one a bit of a glimpse of how overwhelming it was to people of certain social classes at the time. Losing so many heirs, friends, other family members, people they grew up with - all at once like that.<br /><br />2) the series takes on a very interesting period which is not covered very often (on the Royal level, Fall of Eagles is awesome telling the big story) where the world did in fact change. The whole of society was being uprooted as the 'modern world' emerged. Those who can't wait for the change interacting with those who want things to stay exactly the way they have always been - tons of opportunity for dramatic interactions.<br /><br />3) One of the easy-to-miss side stories is of Cora and her money. There were tons of American heiresses who married titles in England during this time frame - Consuelo Vanderbilt and Jennie Jerome (both, incidentally, married into the same family - the one that produced Winston Churchill). Lots of these relationships were miserable. I was glad to see this one; while not perfect, it is happy over the long run.<br /><br />4) LOVE Maggie Smith and her character. She seems to get all the curmudgeonly matron roles lately butthis one is great. Tough and sarcastic on the outside, she has a heart of gold and is sometimes laugh-out-loud funny.<br /><br />5) Finally, love the English terms we Yanks haven't picked up - but we should because we really don't have our own jargon that quite fits. Example: The Earl tells Matthew (the heir) that he should dance with the formidable (and nasty) ladies maid Ms. O'Brien at the Servants Ball. His response \\"Crikey!.\\" Loved it!
B004JMY312|5.0|MY GRANDCHILDREN ENJOYED THIS MOVIE.  IT WAS FUNNY AND ENTERTAINING. WE WATCHED IT MORE THAN ONE TIME. IT WAS A GOOD HALLOWEEN MOVIE,
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Nelson DeMille is such a great writer that I could not wait for the Library to get it and bought it on Amazon for my Kindle.  John Corey is a wisecracking ex NYC Cop assigned to a terrorist task force. The story line is very similar to \\"The Lion\\" but has a lot of twists and turns.  I felt that perhaps DeMille made Corey too much of a joker in this one. After all catching terrorists is serious business but I still could not put it down!

B008GPODCM|3.0|At the start I will state right now I was a Kiss fan, an amateur drummer who listened to every beat, every kick and lived right through the whole Kiss period as a fan. That said, it took all my persistence to get through this book and not put it down out of sheer frustration with the man. This book is written with an axe to grind, with an agenda. This guy who I thought was so cool wanted to have his cake and eat it too and I can easily understand how his bandmates saw him as \\"whining\\" all the time. Almost everything is someone else's fault, bad luck or whatever......when he does admit to making a mistake it's usually prefaced with \\"I was misled\\".....or \\"I was taken advantage of\\" with little or no reflection on the damage his own stupidity could, or would have done to people around him. The treatment of women, hotels & hotel staff is hideous, and frankly he sounds like as big a jerk as the band members he shared the stage with. The sense of entitlement is palpable, the lack of judgement on his personal affairs astounding and at the same time excruciating.<br /><br />This is an interesting read at times for the inside machinations of the world's largest band, but insanely frustrating on the personal level as he repeatedly complains \\"why me?\\"......I'm sorry Peter, but in many ways you got what you deserved. The book is one long ME, ME, ME.......and not in a nice way.<br /><br />Let this be a lesson to anyone who dreams of making it big in music, having groupies on tap, and shoving loads of drugs down their necks........This is the \\"HOW TO NOT MAKE IT IN MUSIC 101\\"<br /><br />Glad to finish it and move on.....and sad to have to write such a scathing review.
B00846REIS|2.0|Boring and Repetitive!  This book was boring and repetitive. Eva sounds like she has her head on straight far more than Vision. Every page is pre-sex sex or post-sex. The book never finished with why he is so screwed up. I wanted to get my money's worth out of this book all the while hoping it would get better but was still disappointed in the end.
B005H9B2CE|1.0|I'm so glad I have Amazon Prime and watched this for free on my Surface RT. This is such a juvenile film that is little more than a mishmash of laughable, predictable subplots, including space and time travel, romance without real chemistry, and the rage of a violence-prone prince, plus one who changes for the better! The acting is truly awful! Production is also second-rate at best.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|Starting off too slow and to much like the rest of her novels. Too much back ground and not enough to hold my interest. I have read almost all of her novels and this one just doesn't match up to first few for excitement and mystery. Way too redundant for it to be interesting for an avid reader of Patricia Cornwell.
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|For those of you who think that Bale's stint as Batman was his first shot at the \\"tormented hero fights even more screwed-up bad guys,\\" you've got to give this movie a try.  It might not be the most thrilling or complex plot, but premise is thought-provoking, the action is well done, and the characters are certainly believable.  As a sci-fi, it could explore its central idea further, but it doesn't preach - and I like that about my sci-fi...it respects the audience members enough to let them come to their own conclusions, unlike some more modern sci-fis that got a lot of hype (*cough*AVATAR*cough*).<br /><br />Highly quotable, thoroughly fun, and worth the watch!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its really fun and can and will keep you busy for hours!!!! its handy on car rides plane rides. ect. butt really its an amazing app
B00881VLCE|5.0|this app features true jigsaw puzzles, not the tile-type puzzles where you slide the pieces around, which is what I've been trying to find for some time now.  lots of puzzles, different options (like rotate pieces or don't rotate as well as puzzles with differing piece amounts, from relatively small at 35 to somewhat more difficult ones with 216 pieces.)  I highly recommend this app to anyone who enjoys jigsaw puzzles as much as I do.  Even more pieces would be better, but I realize this would be nearly impossible to do for tablets - pieces would be too tiny to see).
B007MB5OCE|5.0|I saw a woman read this book while on holidays in Turkey and I wondered what she was reading. She said the book was recommended to her by her friend and so I wrote down the name and author. I am so happy I did! I absolutely enjoyed this book! What a fun and entertaining read. Would recommend it to everyone!
B00006JL1Z|5.0|Great album. Was delivered on time and in perfect condition. Have already listened to it several times. Would recommend to anyone who likes fleet wood Mac or Stevie nicks
B000FCKIFU|4.0|I love Oliver Stone's unassuming hero character. The Camel Club's four members give the story depth and interest. I have already started the next book in the series. I am hopeful it will not disappoint.
B009AJDDQU|5.0|it seems like there have not been that many good science fiction movies in recent years so its nice to see one come out. what happened to space travel being a popular movie/tv show  genre? instead its all these stupid alien invasion movies the last few years (the only good one being district 9). why are aliens allowed to travel space but humans can't?<br /><br />the movie is great amazing special effects and strong acting. i think my only complaint about the movie is a that i wish it was longer honestly the action all felt very rushed and the characters didnt have much time to develop. if you have a 3d tv this is the perfect movie instead of a bunch of over the top effects like bullets and knives flying at the screen trying o show off the 3d the filmmakers manage to work it in in a beautiful artistic way thats helps the movie succeed both in 3d and not. the mix of computer animation and real hand built sets is also nice to see (Hollywood must have a lot of empty sets these days thanks to computers) and works very well making the computer animation feel more real.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Love the game..really mysterious, the story was interesting but my 4 stars are cuz didn't like the ending it finish in nothing but other than That I recommended it :)
B008MG1E4A|3.0|When I first heard of this book I wondered why the author would write it and how he would remain anonymous. I see that it must be hard for these men to risk their lives and do the incredible job they do while they sit silently and watch politicians take credit for their work.  Much of the book sheds light on the daily grind of a seal and what drives one to do this job, but I took away the frustration they feel watching men in suits take credit for the work they do in the trenches.<br /><br />This is a quick read, I could have used some more depth into the author and his team mate's character and the challenges they face, but it was insightful and worth my time. The job these people do and the risk they take is quite literally thankless as they are usually not able to share their missions with friends and family.
B005VZQ95O|5.0|If you are a pink floyd fan and like all of thier records but can't decide which one you like best then this one is for you. It has all of the best tracks.
B000NQRR1Q|2.0|I'm not a Johnny Depp fan, per se, but I find him to be an interesting actor, if not so great at picking worthwhile movies. Unforunately, as I explore his movies, I seem find one or more scenes in each that are laughable and eye-roll inducing. Case-in-point: the last 12 or so minutes of this movie, especially his last scenes with \\"The Girl\\" in front of the castle and her crazy facial expressions that I guess were meant to look wanton and evil but just looked foolish.<br /><br />I didn't think the actress who played \\"The Girl\\" was very good. She was pretty but not that expressive.<br /><br />But the things that baffled me the most was the handling of the valuable books. When books are old and valuable, aren't they usually handled with a lot of care, with cotton gloves in hyper-clean rooms in low light to avoid damage their pages? And certainly cigarette smoke and drinks/liquids are not allowed around them either.<br /><br />There were a few amusing moments, mostly carried off by Depp - that I enjoyed. I wish there had been more of that. I wasn't sure how seriously I was suppose to take the \\"Satanic\\" angle. It wasn't quite sinister enough to be a horror/thriller but not quite interesting enough for me to be a compelling mystery. Like many other reviewers, I was let down by the ending.<br /><br />Not one of Depp's better choices.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|go ahead and buy it I saw all the reviews I tried it and it was so fun now I'm adicted to it nice
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I read a lot. I read books for business and pleasure, but mostly personal development.<br /><br />This book had me hooked from the first page. I could not put it down.<br /><br />I thought this was going to be a second by second account of the \\"day,\\" but it was much more than that.<br /><br />I was a huge fan of Richard Marcinko's earlier work when he wrote with Waterman. This book was like those, but in a class by itself.<br /><br />I feel like I have been out in the sh*t with these guys. I have massive respect for what they do for our country and the sacrifices they make for our safety and freedom.<br /><br />I have told everyone I know how riveting this book was to me. I told them they will thank me for recommending it to them.<br /><br />I was so blown away, I decided to write this review... my first review ever.<br /><br />Owen is an awesome story teller.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This trilogy had me from the first few pages! Well written and keeps your interest all the way through....scary to think we might be looking at a future even similar to this! Ordered it from Amazon (the Kindle edition) and it was so easy...I had it on my phone within a minute!
B003VANOFY|5.0|I searched for a long time before finally settling on these in the price range, and they did not disappoint. The button programming is easy enough for anyone to learn, the surround sound is great, the bass levels good, and the overall fit on the head/ears is comfortable. Testing the range through 2 solid concrete walls, I was still able to get audio to work without problems from 30 feet.<br /><br />The only problem I've ever had is the power button can sometimes be a pain to press, but with use over time I've gotten used to it.<br /><br />Overall, a great product I would recommend to anyone looking in this price range and even higher.

B009RI4FRU|4.0|This was a quirky, fun comedy with great character development. Loved the Boy Scout scenes since I'm a Scout Master. Moonrise Kingdom has some subtle humor and some \\"laugh out loud\\" moments too. I would reccommend this movie.
0307943232|3.0|In the beginning of the book, I thought this was going to be a well crafted thriller.  As time went on, I found it difficult to connect with the main character who told the story in first person.  He was devoid of emotion; he never felt like real flesh and blood, but almost robotic.  His relationships with other key characters were never developed.<br />The premise of the story was a good one, but I found myself in a quagmire of muck wondering what the hell was going on.  This coming from a bibliophile of the highest order.  That tells me Grisham did not take the time to care about his characters or to give the plot the attention it needed to unfold smoothly.  I regret spending the 12.99 on the kindle edition and will think twice before paying for another Grisham book.  Have read most of them, and was only pleased recently with The Confession.  The old stuff is still the best...The Firm, A Time to Kill...
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Love Love Love this app!!  I love the tone of the alarm and how it stops me from over snoozing.
B007MB5OCE|4.0|Hilarious for the most part.  Like many farces  requires a considerable<br />suspension of disbelief.  Before he was 100 years old, the man had encounters<br />with  many world leaders of  the early 20th century and comes up with the<br />definitive idea that makes the A-bomb possible.  How he gets from there to<br />being a mass (3) murderer riding in a school bus with an elephant is quite<br />a tale.  Highly recommended for escapist reading.

B002G1YPH0|5.0|.:: Background ::.<br />I purchased a Hyper 212 in February, 2012 (about nine months ago). I'm a gamer, programmer, and multimedia producer. Because I ask a lot from my machine, I spent a few days researching current coolers before making my decision.<br /><br />.:: Performance ::.<br />My cores are currently 36-39°C, and the highest I've seen is around 60 (while play particularly taxing games on a hot day). This is nearly half of my CPU's Tj. max. However, keep in mind that your case and its fans (my specs below) can have a significant impact on cooling as well. As far as price-to-performance, it's difficult to beat, to say the least.<br /><br />.:: Build Quality ::.<br />The heat sink is durable. Direct heat pipe contact with your CPU is something usually found in more expensive products, but quality doesn't seem to have been sacrificed. The fan is relatively quiet, and it attaches snugly and easily to the heat sink.<br /><br />.:: Installation ::.<br />The Hyper 212 is massive; take careful measurements before purchasing. My mid-size tower has plenty of room for it, but I ran into another problem entirely: it's very difficult to mount this beast due to its size, weight, and method of installation. To install the heat sink, you'll use the included universal mounting bracket which fits over the connection and on the rear of your motherboard. This keeps the sink stable, but it also makes installation difficult without an extra set of hands.<br /><br />As for the fan, it's very easy to attach and remove from the sink; no screws to deal with once the clip has been attached to the fan. In my configuration, I suck air in from the top of my case, across the RAM, through the heat sink fan, and through the rear case fan. It's effective, but it does require the sacrifice of a RAM slot unless you mount the fan slightly higher on the sink (which should be possible unless your RAM has exceedingly large heat sinks as well).<br /><br />.:: Support ::.<br />If you need to purchase a new fan for the sink, Cooler Master sells them individually. For better performance, you might consider buying a second fan to use in a push/pull configuration (one fan to suck air in and one to blow the air out the other side).<br /><br />.:: Conclusion ::.<br />Although it does have its size-related issues, it would be difficult to find a heat sink and fan combo at any price range of the Hyper 212's quality; I certainly recommend it.<br /><br />.:: PC Specs ::.<br />Case - Cooler Master HAF 922 Blue<br />Motherboard - ASUS P8P67 Deluxe (Rev 3.0)<br />Power supply - SeaSonic M12II 620 Bronze 620W<br />CPU - Intel Core i5-2500K Sandy Bridge 3.3GHz<br />Video card - EVGA GeForce GTX 560 Ti FPB (Fermi)<br />RAM - G.SKILL Ripjaws X Series 8GB (2 x 4GB) DDR3 SDRAM (1333)<br />CPU Cooling - Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus<br />UPS - CyberPower CP1000AVRLCD 1000VA 600 Watt UPSse a new fan for the sink, Cooler Master sells them individually.

Her daughter took the DVD and cleaned it really well with a dry cloth and then she was able to watch it.  She gave it back to me, and then it worked for me also, can't figure out why this would not work straight from the package, I thought I would be returning it, but glad we got it to work.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|An unlikely romance in an even more unlikely situation make this movie delightful and even a bit whimsical. I enjoyed it from start to finish!
B0088D3PYE|3.0|Having found the previous two Zafon books well written and engaging, I was looking forward to this, the third one.  I found that it lacked the depth of the others and was quite disappointed in it.  I will read his next book, though, as one gets the impression at the end of this one that there is more to come..
B00005JKGK|5.0|I wish the movie could be spoken in Spanish so it would be understood much better among the Hispanic viewers who don't speak English (reading the subtitles in Spanish is somehow difficult for most people).
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|I enjoyed this film. Lots of inside jokes but on a level that even someone new could appreciate.  It was nice to see how all the characters tied together but still retained their original parts.  Loved the mix of action, adventure, combined with good story telling and some romance.
0486275590|3.0|I don't like the five star rating system.  I want to give this one a 3.5 star rating.  Why can't we use a 1-10 scale instead, it give much more granularity.  Anyway. . .<br /><br />As I'm finding more often is the case, the story is not what we have all come to know from Hollywood depictions.  Normally that is a good thing, but in this case the Hollywood versions are better.  The ties between Long John Silver and Jim were much more tenuous in this book than in more recent portrayals and I think that's not as fun.  Because it is a well known story it also lacks the excitement of something really new.<br /><br />That said, it think everyone should read it.  It is a fun, short book, easy to read despite some old English and it was a blast to see from where the quintessential pirate and pirate story originated.  Plus I read it near International Talk Like a Pirate Day, so I had fresh fodder for chatting with my fellow scurvy dogs.  Arrrrr!
B009G8GRX6|5.0|Buy it.<br /><br />Muse will never let you down or cease to amaze you. As a fifty-something human who has never outgrown being on the Edge of Edgy, I can honestly say that Muse is my first 'favorite' group in a very long time. The 2nd Law does not disappoint.<br /><br />The 1st Rule for The 2nd Law? Buy it. Just... buy it.
0307592731|5.0|Strayed writes about her experience on the Pacific Crest Trail in such a compelling manner that the reader seems to be taking every step with her!!!
B007EECSFA|5.0|I really loved this one.  Dorothy is one of those characters that you love and want to strangle all at the same time. I found myself turning pages desperately wanting to know what her secret was that she could keep it from everybody for so many years. A secret that would cause mother of 5 to kill. I tell you again......read this one!
B007EECSFA|5.0|This book has everything I like in a good read:  location of story, multi-facited characters that develop with the story and a story line which keeps me turning the page and surprises me at the end.
B00846F1YW|3.0|This one did not keep my interest as the first one.  The hidden objects were to easy to find.  Need more of a challenge.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Game is fun, my husband and I compete :) Light and easy to play. Worth playing if you like simple non stressful games
B007FEZQF8|5.0|A fan of the show on AMC, so I added this to my Kindle library to see how much different the comic version was.  Some immediate differences were obvious. The build up turmoil between Rick and Shane wasn't as pronounced as the show. But overall a great reading experience!<br /><br />Will continue with the following volumes.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|Delightfully quirky. I was left wanting a bit more more dialogue, more Bill Murray, more Bruce Willis and more Frances McDormand...LOVED the young actors and the unexpected turns...
B005JQP6X6|5.0|After 40 years, the Giant collection in in my cell phone. As a Berklee College Of Music Alumni, I appreciate the musicianship more today than ever, given the choices of todays rock bands. In my eyes, they are and will always be ground breakers in UK influenced progressive rock of the early 70's. Gentle Giant was even more impressive live, which I had the fortune of seeing at the Fillmore East, NY. Catch their concerts on YouTube. Giant, thank you for the inspiration!!!!<br />Ken S
B00933JL0A|4.0|Enjoyable little game that let's you build a town from scratch. Love the gameplay in which everything occurs in its own time. Building requires the worker to bring raw materials to the worksite. Construction is delayed if you don't have enough resources but continues as soon as you do. Not a game for those who lack patience as every thing is dependant on everything else. A wonderful economic microcosm teaching supply chains and community. The \\"townies\\" are fun to watch carry out their tasks and see what they choose to do with free time (just be sure you give them something interesting to look at).<br />Do wish there were more \\"scenarios\\" in addition to sandbox. I like to feel I am accomplishing something. More maps,or at least a changeable layout for each map would be good.<br />This game is intelligent, addictive and fun in a way that doesn't require killing and explosions.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Downloaded this free calculator app on my Kindle Fire and it works great.  Much easier to use than the calculator app on my iPhone!
B000QGAU4E|5.0|I hadn't heard of this movie before but was pleasantly surprised at how awesome it was.  The camerawork is spectacular and the sets are beautiful, though the film captures a very bleak time.  The plot was engaging and not over-the-top unbelievable, as some science fiction has a tendency to be.  If you're searching for an intelligent and compelling movie, I would recommend Children of Men.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|It is very good and the book is reflect totally in the history. I can't wait for the next movie!!!!!!
B005TMSN4E|5.0|This little gem will win your heart should you have older Nikkors in your bag. I have shot over 500 pictures using various AIS Manual, AFD, and AFSG lenses from 11mm to 300mm including the TC-17 Teleconverter with a Nikon 1 V1. All of my older lenses are so much better than the 10-30mm kit lens that most of the time I expect the FT-1 will be on this camera. Here are a couple of items which I discovered that may be helpful as I did not find this information in the Nikon literature and in the case of the 70-200 f/2.8 VR, Nikon support could not answer why this lens was not on the approved list for the FT-1.<br /><br />1. Motion Snapshot and Smart Photo Selector modes do not work on the Nikon 1 V1 when using the FT-1.<br />2. The range finder does not work with non-CPU lenses (AIS Lenses) and there is no exif data captured for these lenses.<br />3. A pleasant surprise is that the the View Finder in the 1V1 is good enough for focusing AIS lenses, even a 50mm prime at f/1.4.<br />4. It is difficult if not impossible to focus AIS lenses with the monitor even zoomed if hand holding. Tripod live view focusing is great.<br />5. For AFS, autofocus is very good and manual focus using the range finder is excellent. Exif data is captured by the 1V1.<br />6. For AFD, there is no autofocus, but the view finder and monitor work well.<br />7. Now to the 70-200 F/2.8VR, which is not listed as a compatible lens. I saw reference in a Nikon magazine article to this lens being used with the FT-1. It seems that the VR mechanism continues to run rather than cycling on and off based on pushing the shutter release on the camera as it does on my Nikon DSLRs. So I just turn off VR with the switch on the side of the lens and all is well. Of course I must switch VR back on manually if I want it, but this is a lot better than spending over $2000 for the VRII version of the lens!<br /><br />Overall I could not be more pleased with an accessory for my bag as it makes my whole Nikon lens set available to the Nikon 1 system. Shooting at a 35mm equivalent of 1350mm with the 300mm F/4 and TC-17 on the FT-1 at f/6.7 means that I can do descent animal shots with the Nikon 1 system without spending $8,000 for a big heavy telephoto lens. At first I thought Nikon was nuts with the tiny CX sensor, but now I see the brilliance of their design choice. I am 70 years old and to get the kind of telephoto performance in this lightweight package opens up a whole new genre for me as I just could not lug around the heavy lenses and DSLRs in the field.<br /><br />Buy it, you'll love it.....
B004MYFUC8|4.0|I had already read two books by different authors that came after Pride and Prejudice. I loved the first two books and was not disappointed in Pride And Prejudice. It was full of intrigue and romance, could not put it down.
B009KHCT94|4.0|If you can accept the idea of steampunk nazis on the moon, everything that follows is enjoyable in this campy sci-fi along the same vein as Doc Savage, Buck Rogers and Flash Gordan.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a fun match 3 or more game that has a little story to go with it. Each level changes a little so that you do not just have a rectangle grid. There may be blocked sections and you are trying to get pieces of an item to the bottom. There are even locked items that need to be unlocked by matching items with it. Overall, I find it an enjoyable time killer.
B0081BU42O|3.0|I may well have missed the point, but it seems to me that, unlike most of his other SF books, the \\"big secret\\" that everyone is after is practically stated outright fairly early in the book, and there isn't any definitive sense of closure to the tale -- no retribution, no ultimate reckoning for the villains. Also, there is a stand-off in which a Culture Ship browbeats an opponent merely by revealing its' full name and waggling its' metaphorical eyebrows, much in the way that Matt Smith's Doctor, on his first outing, scared off a bunch of alien invaders by inviting them to, effectively, Google him. It's perilously close to jumping the shark...
B001J20ZIA|5.0|Great family movie with a very relevent story line.  A small young man, Lucas, is being bullied by a larger boy and takes his flustration out on the ants living in his yard.  An ant wizard casts a spell which shrinks Lucas down to ant size where he sees the results of his own bullying and understands the error of his actions.  Good entertainment as well as a good lesson in one of the causes of bullying and helps him break out of his own cycle.
B009329ZF2|3.0|I know, I know.  What did I expect when the movie is about aliens?  Actually the aliens are pretty cool and the way the military guys figured out a way to deal with them is pretty cool as far as science fiction goes.  There are just too many cliches though.  \\"Top Gun\\" over-dramatized sequences are frequent.  My wife and I looked at each other and rolled our eyes too many times to give this one more than a three star rating.  I think any movie gets three stars if you can stand to watch it all the way through and we did.  We survived the attack, but barely!
B008XG1X18|4.0|it works great on my kindle fire! sometimes it has an error message but it works itself out. I like it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a book that I read in 24 hours.  At first I thought I knew where it was going and became so angry with one of the characters I almost stopped reading the book and then the whole thing changed in a way I didn't see coming.  It was a great read!  You will enjoy the twists and turns!
B00910Y1OQ|2.0|this game is quite challenging, however the 7 th level of greek is unsolvable, after I free all the objects it still keeps going, I've had it up to 17 minutes of clearing the tiles and no further targets appear and it is unsolved!
B003QZ5222|3.0|I have read the reviews for this box set and agree for the most part.  It is a nice set especially for the price, but like others I was waiting to see about the disc of \\"The Darkness On The Edge Of Town\\" whereas several said the disc was blank and I too download onto my computer for mp3 files but alas when I got to that disc, the sleeve was included but this disc was missing.  I have contacted the dealer I purchased it from and awaiting response but I wanted to make buyers aware of this problem as if you are like me you don't open all of your purchases at once and wait to do so until you want/need it.  The rest of this collection, as I said for the price is well worth the money, but be careful to check to see that you have a complete set.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Wonderful CD!  It sounds surprisingly more like a classical cd than I expected! Since I have seen these guys on Youtube as well as on TV, it was easy to visualize how these talented guys use the piano for so many sound effects.  I'm not sure someone who had not seen them perform would appreciate the music as much.
0978545095|5.0|I had heard about Ms. Maier before any books had been published, and I was quite interested by the few pictures I had seen.  She has a personal story that resonates with me: she simply went out and photographed for the sake of photographing.  And that's just a wonderful thing.<br /><br />While the book's printing isn't as good as \\"Ansel Adams at 100,\\" it is very good.  The layout of the book, in a square to match the 6x6 negative, and its photographs, provide an immersing experience.  Ms. Maier photographed whatever it occurred to her to photograph, from a the ankles of a man showing threadbare socks with holes, to children in the park, to a lady walking down the streen wearing fur and pearls.<br /><br />The book is just full of moments of life as people lived it, going about their lives.  If anything inspires you to take a camera with you on a walk or a bike ride, let it be this humble book.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST IDEA I HAVE SEEN IN A WHILE.  I USE IT EVERY DAY AND EVERY AFTERNOON AND EVERY NIGHT. IF THEY CAME OUT ITH ONE FOR CELL PHONES I WOULD GET IT FOR MY.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|very dull, not interesting, same old, nothing new from Cornwell.  Spends too much time on technical things, which I do know about.  Scarpetta/Cornwell thinks too much of herself.
B009QW7HMC|5.0|This episode start out with a tsunami wave of ghouls lurking every where.  All the members of Ricks team steps up there game and puts the smack down on those zombies.  Let's not forget the ultimate warrior queen Michonne.  She works that Katana like a Ginsu knife commercial.  Amazon made it possible for me to watch Walking Dead the next day while on lunch break.
B004UID2LC|1.0|this app in Bad DO NOT get it. It will freeze up when you try to download a video and stay like that for months
B0084YAU86|5.0|Benedict is so amazing I can't begin to describe his awsomeness! I cannot WAIT till season 3 comes out!!!!!! Steve Moffet hits a home run with this series. MORE PLEASE:).
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this app is the best it is time consuming and additive. I love it at restaurant when I wait for the food.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Very clever dialogue especially John Corey. Good insight into what is happening in Middle East. A bit unrealistic concerning the CIA, FBI, etc, but a very entertaining read. DeMille continues too be a very skillful story teller.
B009O8L72Y|5.0|This episode was very well written. The story was good. I thought that it was another really good episode and I look forward to the rest of the season. This episode was in my opinion a funny episode at times and I love the fight scenes.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Great story about some of the absurdities of being young.  Exquisite visuals and unique coverage of most of the interiors add to the quirkiness of the action.  Exceptional acting especially by the teenagers who star.  A movie you'll remember for a long time.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|not really crazy about the way the story jumped around but all in all, a great read. Am now anxious to see the movie.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|This is a story written by the author who was there. He reveals the story of war in all its gory, not glory.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME AND I HOPE U DO TO it has dragons in it who doesnt love dragons and u can help out ur friends
B009FZZK8I|5.0|The best show on TV in years. Every episode has a twist and a turn the viewer never sees coming.
B007EECSFA|4.0|As my 2 year old granddaughter would say, OH MYYYY GAWSH!  I also know why my sister in law said that she locked herself in the bathroom for the final 30 pages of this book!<br /><br />This was my first Kate Morton book, however, it will not be my last.<br /><br />I will begin by telling you that this took me awhile to get through.  There were many times when I just wanted to put the book down and walk away, however, \\"The Secret\\" kept me coming back.  We learn very quickly what the secret is.  The story is how we got to the secret.<br /><br />You will never in a million years figure this one out until everything is revealed in the last 20% of the book.  The characters really come to life then and we learn why they did the things that they did and when they did them.<br /><br />The book moves between present day and the end of WWII and early 1960's.  It is a fantastic web of mystery and suspense.  I heartily recommend this to anyone that likes a mystery with a bit of a love story thrown in for good measure.
B0011XBLUS|5.0|This movie has good gun slinger parts but also brings out the terribleness of war particularly the civil war.  This is a must see classic!
B002NXZY8K|5.0|Scorsese is a cinematic genius...it is a masterpiece everyone should see this film i got an A in my film class from this movie
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|The first season was awesome and so is this one!  You never know what will happen next!!! HIGHLY recommend!<br /><br />Thea acting is so good and the suspense will keep you watching!
B009GEAPYW|4.0|I enjoyed this a great deal, epic! I enjoyed how the new Robin found Batman, and how he accepted her. I am looking forward to part 2.
B004J4WN0I|5.0|I stumbled across this title as a recommended item from Amazon. I am glad that I gave it a second look.  I quickly read through this and the subsequent titles in about a week's time.  The series is an example of good urban fantasy and reminded me of The Dresden Files.
B008PZ69T8|4.0|Classical music was never my choice of music. But after reading fifty shades, I'm intrigued by how classical pieces can inspire such a great story. So I bought this album and I'm drawn to these pieces immediately. Supposed to receive it after my exams, but it came on the day before my first paper. These pieces calmed my ball of nerves greatly. And as I was re-reading fifty shades, the effect of listening to these pieces at the same time is fantastic. Recommend greatly to people who wants to get introduced to classical music and people who enjoyed fifty shades. (:
B001BANK32|5.0|I've read this book 4 times now, the first time was in high school and I slept with my light on for a week!!  But it got me hooked on Stephen King, you won't be disappointed!!
B0091REZMW|1.0|Because with this game you're gonna need it!  From it's. extremely lengthy (and annoying!!) intro instructions to it's convoluted list of things you can &quot;buy&quot; (like a &quot;flashlight&quot; for every scene so you can actually see what you're looking for!!) this game takes badness to a new level!  The sole purpose of this game is to wander from room to room collecting items for experience points and &quot;coins&quot;.  Of course you must have a certain amount of both before the game will let you move on to another room.  But fear not...there are plenty of coins available...if you're willing to use your Visa card and buy them from Amazon!!  Trust me - you WILL need to use your Visa A LOT for this game because as the intro States this game is never ending.  Yup  as long as people are willing to keep buying &quot;coins&quot; from Amazon the writers will keep adding more rooms!  Why you and your Visa card can play this game forever you lucky Dickins!!  I sure hope you have a lot of free time and a high credit limit.  You're gonna need it!  :-O
B007IXWL2C|5.0|When I first started reading I was a little intimated.  I don't usually read books like this, however once I got half way though, all I could think about was what will happen next.  Once I finished the first book, I became excited to read the second (darker) and was even more pleased with the story line.  Once I finish Freed, I too felt freed.  I was very happy with reading this trilogy.  I would read more from this Author.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Excellent for jotting down ideeas or copying blurbs of information you need to refer to later. It is the besy note taking app I've used so far.
B004LOMB2Q|1.0|Heck, i love evernote. Its great, and the storage is awesome. But there is a bad side to evernote. They have acsess to your phone and your contacts. Darn you, Evernote! This is why i encourage springpad. It is nicer, permissions much much much better, and it a mixture between evernote (the good parts) and pinterest. Get springpad. i encourage it for the safety and privacy of your contacts.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Love it.  Better than I was expecting from the book. Looking forward for the next book in the trilogy series
B008JMKN4Y|1.0|too young for me. this is for college age readers. silly, predictable, just plain dumb. younger generation might enjoy, but don't expect anything exciting.
1423140605|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book in the series. I like how there is no age-inappropriate content. Look forward to the next one. My children (ages 10 and 8) love the story of both this and the Percy Jackson series.
B000MZHW40|5.0|History of a great teacher<br />Even if in theater<br />Wow that's all I can say<br />It just goes to show you never really know<br />But in the end truth always prevails<br />Never know who will be in your corner<br />be thankful for small blessings!
B007EECSFA|4.0|I've read all of Kate Morton's books and this one does not disappoint.  A good mystery with a great twist that I didn't see coming.  I enjoyed it.
1400069289|5.0|It has been a while since I have read a highly readable book.  One of those books that makes you turn the pages, instead of having to turn the pages.  A book like this is rare.  It has to be on a topic of value, and it has to be insightful, and highly readable, which means engaging stories and information.  This book has it all.  It is about the development of habits, and the power that these have on life.  It is a highly practical book, one of those self-need types without the odd self-need feel.  You do not feel sick reading it, rather you feel down right smart.  The book uses various stories to illustrates the flow of habits.  How are habits made, how do you break them, how do you create them.  This book helps people develop those habits that will lead to success and help them stop the habits that are destroying their lives.  As a minister, this was awesome material, because I am always looking for ways to help people create spiritual habits in life.  One of the best parts was on triggers.  If you can create a strong trigger in someone, you can create a powerful habit.  Also, in the habit flow, if you can create a positive reward, you can use this to create habits.  This book is really good, and best of all, helpful.  I highly recommend it.
B00A11AN6O|3.0|I origionally posted this review on nov 1st when the app first came out.  For some reason Amazon made that app out of stock and reloaded.  Here is my review of their product.<br /><br />I have an original kindle fire and that was one of my main gripes that it did not look to the cloud for pictures. Since they are not going to update us to the new software I got excited when I saw this app. I've played with it a bit now and the one thing that I really don't like about it is that you cannot share your pictures as a group. I want to share pictures with my family and I have to click on each picture and share it out individually and my family has to click on a link per picture. That is really not a usable app for sharing pictures. It is new and they just started, hence the 3 stars. If they update it to include mass share and folder share then I will rate it 5 stars.
0385341679|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE karen marie moning! I ordered the hardcover through gohastings and even though its used the condition is flawless!!! I have the digital copy of all her books but i loved them so much i wanted a real copy, i looked everywhere and they must not print them anymore or something because i could nit for the life of me find them. I was apprehensive about buying a used book but im so glad i did. I cant wait for the rest to come :)
B008673ZAQ|2.0|I wish I loved Reflected in You even half as much as Bared to You.  To be honest, I could not even bring myself to finish this book.  From the beginning, the story felt flat and unrealistic to me.  The few \\"steamy\\" scenes that I did read were bizarre, difficult to read and honestly made me uncomfortable (the limo scene). Makes me sad because I couldn't wait for this to be released and I feel as though I wasted my money.
B003TSEL7S|4.0|I was very glad that Riordan decided to expand on the Percy Jackson World. For the most part this book was great but if your a Percy Jackson fan you might be dissappointed since he is not really in this book. Still if you read it you would like it.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|BORING. Very disappointed. I always look forward to these books but this was a struggle to get through. Wasn't worth the full price.
B008ADSDHQ|5.0|In some ways, I'm glad I read this after all the other Harry Hole books. As I went through the others, references to his past were non-specific and it left some mystery to the character for me. On the surface, Harry is another damaged detective with personality quirks galore. It's the storyline for dozens of police procedurals. Somehow, though, Nesbo manages to elevate him beyond that stereotype to an incredibly likeable underdog, you can't help but pull for.<br /><br />Nesbo cleverly reveals insights into why Harry is as he is, making them key parts of the storyline, rather than a personality profile as a set up to the core story line.<br /><br />Can't recommend this series enough.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|I kept waiting for something to happen.  The book's premise had so much potential but for page after page, there was absolutely no action.  It didn't get exciting until the very end.
B004CEUEWE|5.0|Ben Affleck totally revived his career with this film. It is exciting and well directed. His performance, along with that of Jeremy Renner is quite good.I would recommend this film to anyone. Enjoy
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|I got this game expecting it would be similar to Angry Birds.  I was pleasantly surprised that it is NOTHING like that game, except that it has the pigs in it.  It has some of the best puzzles and problem solving levels in any game that I've played in a long time.  I would have gladly paid a few dollars for this game for the amount of play time I've gotten out of it.  And it's free, why not give it a shot!
B001LOU6ZS|4.0|I think it would have been asking a lot for the band to replicate the two previous efforts, but that doesn't mean this album isn't strong. I just think if this album would've had a couple less songs, the band would have been better for it. With that being said, I think there are eight really well tailored songs. I think where the band misfires is with a song like \\"Terri\\", which is trying too hard to be the next \\"Cherry\\". I'm a riff guy, but I just think a song like \\"You'll Get Love\\" is dare I say, boring. I just think it's a pedestrian sounding riff that doesn't go anywhere. Even though I love the saxophone in a song like \\"The Writer\\", I think the song is clearly driven by the dual guitars. Unfortunately, the same can't be said with the song \\"Somethin' Less\\", where the guitars are lowered in the mix, and the saxophone is driving the song. I just think it should have been the other way around. With that being said, I think the other eight songs are beyond strong. My favorite songs in order are: \\"Feel It\\", \\"Dreaming\\", \\"The Writer\\", \\"We Belong to the Night\\", \\"Let It Rain\\", \\"Doing It All For You\\", \\"Back Into My Life\\", \\"Heel of a Stranger\\" (the B-Side to Let It Rain), \\"Terri\\", \\"You'll Get Love\\", & \\"Somethin' Less\\". The remastering job that E.M.I. did on all of the UFO are top notch and the live recordings are definitely a plus. Though, I think there is a little drop off from the last two albums \\"No Place To Run\\" & \\"The Wild The Willing & the Innocent\\", this is still a classic UFO album.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|After watching this movie, I was mad that I didn't just buy this movie instead of renting it.  It is by far my favorite Marvel movie so far, and they blend in the characters and their feuds perfectly.  This is a must see for anyone who is a Marvel fan, and I highly recommend you buy it rather than rent it!
B008Y2FRFO|1.0|This game locked up my Kindle Fire. I had to delete it. I was very upset by this because I had just purchased coins to continue to play.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I highly recommend this book, and the whole series. Suzanne Collins is a very talented author, and this story had be completely enthralled. I don't know people say it is a kids book though, because I wouldn't say anyone under 15 could grasp the story. It can be a bit gorey at times, but it's an excellent read.<br /><br />I couldn't put these books down!
B0097VS7ZS|1.0|Coloring Book 2 is 2 difficult to use and doesn't allow much creativity for the user. My grandchildren were disappointed with this app.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I highly recommend this book, and the whole series. Suzanne Collins is a very talented author, and this story had be completely enthralled. I don't know people say it is a kids book though, because I wouldn't say anyone under 15 could grasp the story. It can be a bit gorey at times, but it's an excellent read.
B002QCD2OG|1.0|I cannot believe Rotten Tomatoes gave this an 89% by the critics.  The only interesting thing about the movie was to show the tacky dress and hairstyles that we had in the early 1970's - I should know since I was in my early 20's at that time.  Horror???  Boring is more like it.
B008VBYN80|4.0|The graphics aren't terrible and who doesn't like feudal era war?  I would recommend. this game to anyone who like medieval warfare in the fantasy genre.
B000V6738U|4.0|Great CD! Has all of the hits! Just what I was looking for, all in one package. Dont have to buy multiple CDs.
0756688701|5.0|This book is great for the Disney Pixar Cars Fan or Collector! It will tell you everything about all the car characters and what movie or short story they are from. Things you wouldn't know like some of the cars are only available in other countries, but you can find them here. They will only cost you an arm and a leg! It's very informative, useful, and you get a Lightning McQueen car and poster to boot!
0316227706|5.0|OMG! I LOVE THIS BOOK! The size of the book is really nice. And the quality is great too. The pictures are AMAZING. They're just so adorable!!! My son loves this book too. Great for the coffee table. Best purchase ever.
B008FTAAG2|5.0|I really enjoyed this album. I don't really like writing reviews. I just wanted to give this album a 5 star cause i thought it kicked ass.
B0063GORYU|5.0|If you like solitare games you will love this one.  It keeps you entertained and thinking of the best move.  When it doesn't seem as challenging you can add another suit.  Great game!
B008QTVNUI|5.0|Homeland is truly a great show. All the awards that it has won are definitely deserved. I highly recommend watching this show.
B00723NWJE|5.0|i am not known, but i would rather be notorious for having carpet bombed opinions that hurts everyone than mellow opinion that suprises nobody.<br /><br />it feels like as if writing something online is suposed to be dogmatic and orthodox these days and if u don't, or if u don't please the readewr, u are going to hell.<br /><br />NO. I DON'T PLEASE READERS WHO MOSTLY THINK THAT THIS ALBUM SUCSK.<br /><br />this albums rocks for those that are tired of life. a bliss for the cynicals.<br /><br />end of story,.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This dvd has easy moves to do physically but the right difficulty to work your butt off. There are different levels to work through.
B0086700CM|5.0|Temple run is a great game. The quality is amazing and it works great.... no glitches. I am actually addicted to the game and I cant stop playing it. My whole family likes it and the best thing is you can play even if you don't have wick so that's always great. Your looking for a fun gameto play then temple run is definetly it ;)
B008XMXFS6|5.0|For the band that loves the play on words, why not a review title that reflects it? The Darkness is one of the best rock bands around today. Thank goodness they got back together and released another album. The diversity of influences is greater here than their other two albums, even country / bluegrass and island sounds are in evidence! Hawkins' vocals still soar, and the songs never take themselves too seriously, and are a welcome relief from the whiny-ass \\"nu rock\\" that is thankfully being seen for the mistake that it is and slowly disappearing from contaminating my eardrums.<br /><br />Can't wait to attend another concert! Hope they come this way soon.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Ive looked all over amazon for some decent logic puzzles and this is one of the few that are actually both challenging and entertaining. This is somewhat similar to logic lasers on xbox but this is much prettier.
B007FG9LIE|4.0|I actually read this book using the borrow feature of the Kindle and Prime - but loved it so much felt compelled to just purchase it afterwords!  It was a great read, and definitely kept me up late nights pushing ahead way past my bed time ;)<br /><br />The book description gives enough detail about the story, and honestly I wouldn't want to say anything else as half the fun is in discovering the secret of the story.  The author mentions in the afterword that he was inspired by shows like Twin Peaks and LOST and it definitely shows.  This book definitely had some turns that you simply didn't expect and it always kept throwing \\"what the heck!?\\" moments that kept you reading to find out more.<br /><br />All in all a great read, and a pleasant surprise from a random \\"purchase\\" just browsing Amazon!  I will definitely be checking out more from this author.
B00000JMOF|5.0|Is there ANYBODY out there that has not seen this timeless classic. This is a good one for grandparents to gently introduce the younger ones to Horror movies. Yeah it's in black and white but that only adds to the overall scare value of Colin Clive declaring IT'S ALIVE!!!!
0679737456|3.0|I had heard many things about this memoir, and they prompted me to buy the book.  Upon reading it, I did not find the memoir particulary challenging, nor was it particularly well written.  While it is clear that the writer expressed her experiences as an inner city black in a historically all-white prep school, her account did not \\"go\\" anywhere.  If the point of the book was merely to explain how difficult the whole experience was, then so what?  It was no different<br /> than that of similar memoirs.  I did not come away with any sense of admiration for her, nor pity either.  The popularity of another memoir, THE GLASS CEILING, which contains frightening accounts of a dysfunctional family had more of an impact.  That memoir spoke of actual survival, children's survival.  BLACK ICE paled by comparison, and there exist other works which detail survival in prep schools with more drama and impact.
B009JNXK88|5.0|Actually just bought this the other day before it became FAOTD and I absolutely love it. At under a dollar, this game is a steal!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved the second installment of Bared to You. It takes a turn that I didn't expect and left me wanting more!<br />The series is similar to Fifty Shades, but it has a different \\"flavor.\\" If you liked  Christian, you will like Gideon.
B0087GF8ZG|5.0|The Hipe 8 LED lights work great.  They are able to sense motion from a pretty good distance and the illumination is bright. If you ever have a question about their operation, Hipe's customer service is fantastic.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|A refreshing voice in the space hero genre.  The main character talks and jokes like a pilot/aircrewman, not like some politically correct nancy boy.  The book reads like an expanded Emergency Procedures Manual, but it is fun, funny, and engaging.<br />The only drawback is the dearth of descriptions of the landscapes of Mars.  The color and \\"flavor\\" of the planet never comes across other than we are constantly reminded that it's very cold with no air to breathe.
0307279189|2.0|This book actually made me take the time to go here, find the book and then write this review. The reason is, that during the reading of this I felt the increasing feeling of wating my time. There's so much fill in and irrelevant boring storytelling which has nothing to do with the 'Born to run' title. I sense the journalist sensationalism trying to make it exciting and worth reading, but it just doesn't succeed. This book is 90% nonsense and derouting and 10% actual information about the whole running life and how.
B00979CS50|2.0|I was excited to hear this Crazy Horse reunion disc and grew more encouraged after reading the early reviews. However, it is a bloated, somewhat uninteresting record. Driftin' Back would be a fine six-minute song. Unfortunately, it's 21 minutes longer than that. Twisted Road is ok. Only Ramada Inn stands out, working very well in its 16-minute slot. That one is heading for the iPod and then the double-disc will be sent to the archive drawer, possibly never again to see the light of day. It turns out Waging Heavy Peace is Neil's masterwork for 2012.
B0083Z614S|5.0|Wonderful and sweet. Very heartwarming!!! I watched the movie as a young child and loved it. The book is even better!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|everybody wuz talking about angry birds at school so I downloaded this and I SO LOVE IT!!!! the ads are a little annoying but most of them don't block my view so I'm cool with it. so recommend this to anyone out there who hasn't played angry birds yet
B008OJ291W|1.0|There's enough reviews about how classics should not be redone or how new mastering techniques ruin the dynamics and I agree 100% with that.  I'm wondering how people could look at this track list and think these were the best ELO songs??  I could probably list 20 ELO songs that were better than these.  For example, the entire TIME album.  Every song on there was better than this.  Or there's Calling America, Heaven Only Knows, etc.  Is Jeff so old that he forgot the 1980s?  That's pretty sad if he never realized that a lot of his songs from the 80s were better than his songs from the 70s.<br />And another thing---  do people actually like the song Telephone Line?  I get a kick out of it for being so over-the-top cheesy, but I never thought people took it seriously as a good song.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|Nicely written true murder set in china on the edge of WWII.  Provides solid tangents for book club participants to discuss: history, travel, and the who and how and why of the school girls  murder.  Enough detail about place and key figures to develop a feel for the time. My club had the advantage of a participant who had gone to english school in Peking at the same time and even as a girl of 11 remembered Pamela's death.
B009329ZF2|4.0|I had a snobby attitude about this film, but my 10 year old son really wanted to see it.  We sat down, watched, and had a great time.  Not a great film, but definitely fun with the kids.  Great for home viewing.
B009JNXK88|3.0|It's ok for the FAOTD if you like old-school games, but I mean REALLY old-school. I would much rather play a game with cool graphics and some variety.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham at his best, Malcolm Bannister is my hero! This book will keep you reading nonstop, the twist & turns just keeps you in suspense. Not wanting to give anything away, just know that the brother goes out BIG! Can't wait for the movie, or better yet a second book. Nattie's Revenge (just a thought) or if Mr. Bell started investigating the Armanna Mines.<br />Great Book!!!!!!!!!!!
B00632HWOG|4.0|I found this to work fairly well with my only issue being with contact list integration.  Once syncing the contact list over I found that my overall list tripled with the culprit being duplicate entries.  Since this email app is not much different than many others regarding dupe contacts I still felt 4 stars was warranted.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so entertaining!!!  You should definantly get it!!!  It is one of my favorite games!!! Download it now:)
1451662432|5.0|It is hard for me to review this book, as it was a gift for a friend of mine.  I think she liked it, though.  I was happy that I could get it for her.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|As an avid history buff, always trying to broaden the extent of my understanding of how and why things came to be. This book provides personal context in the same fashion as an Edward Rutherford novel, which in my opinion, is the single best way to truly understand an event or time period. This book follows what Follet started in The Fall of Giants, and is of equal caliber. I woudl recommend reading FOG first to give yourself the background of the families involved, but it isn't entirely necessary, however I would remind that the key to understanding WW2 is WW1.<br /><br />Read and enjoy!
B009NQKXYK|5.0|Was a Very interesting movie. I have never watched any of the Alien movies but after watching this, It makes me want to watch them now.
B002UM5BXW|4.0|I enjoyed this book quite a bit.  I have to say it is a bit crude but this is part of the experience - which is what I expected the book to be about.  It's somewhat amazing that his writing style is very intelligent yet comes crashing down to earth quickly - so if you start getting bogged down with fancy words don't worry - he is about to keep it real in just a sec.  For those thinking of entering into chef-dom this is a good book for you to read to know the type of lifestyle/work you are about to commit.  Don't expect any words about his tv show - this isn't what it's about.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Truly enjoyed the different way this Charles Dickinson story was written.  It was a very entertaining and is still truly the best christmas story.
B000RLHDUM|5.0|This is a great movie, and a love story too. Action from the beginning to the very end. Great acting as well, solid movie!
B000QCQ8XA|4.0|I loved this sample then I bought it and wasn't as sure. I finally went back to it and it was awesome.  Funny and warm. Loved the dad and the step son. It's worth it.
B009PEPML4|5.0|and yet still the same. one of my friends kidded me by describing this album without hearing it. he was right: \\"is it 20 minute tracks that slowly build to loud climax, then slow down again?\\"<br /><br />of course, it's the manner in which the tracks accelerate and decelerate. And I have to say that there's something new going on here that, after over 15 listens, I haven't yet figured out. Something about the textures and the drums. Perhaps it's the mix; perhaps it's simply that there's been so much time since the last release.<br /><br />Whatever the case, if you liked prior tracks or albums by Godspeed You! Black Emperor, this will not disappoint you. If you already dislike them, this probably won't win you over.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|This turned out to be a better book than I had thought it was going to be.  It's a little hard to get started in reading but once you get into the meat of the book; it is good.
1451695195|5.0|I enjoyed the evaluation this author brings to the subject as a Neurosurgeon. I am a believer and this book has increased my slipping faith. If you are intrigued by how physics, and brain science relates to this experience, Dr Eben Alexander as a doctor and scientist who disregarded NDEs, afterlife, and who wasn't very religious explains how they related to his 'life after life' chapter. Dr. Eben Alexander connects science (Quantum physics) and spirituality and how they relate to this phenomenon. It reminds me of Dr. Hameroff's stunning theory that many scientists are now embracing. It is, that micro-tubules within the brain form a bridge between the quantum world and the regular world. The quantum world is little understood, but it is where we get things like color, feelings, a sense of morals, etc. The classical world is purely physical, with laws that Einstein and Newton formulated.<br /><br />I have waited with much anticipation for the release of this book. I personally have not had a near-death experience but am interested in the studies of NDEs. It's encouraging to have the author, as a highly trained Neurosurgeon, describe his experience and explain what happened to him with the logic and language of the scientist he is, and that there's no scientific explanation for what he experienced. I think brain damage goes a long way toward making this seem like a reasonable proposition that can be accepted. This book is great for all to read!<br /><br />When you are able to swallow the true beauty of this phenomenon, the concept of science and spirituality united as one, becomes easy to accept and embrace. A notion that Einstein, The Dalai Lama and many other respected  intelligent individuals with credence have believed and tried to convey to us all.<br /><br />It appears many want a more in depth, vivid description of Dr. Alexander's account of Heaven. I suggest buying the October 15th, 2012 edition of Newsweek containing a 4 page description solely about the Dr.'sexperience including the questions he asked and the answers he received among much more interesting details that happened to him when he experienced a different realm. It's a great article written by Alexander himself. If you're unable to buy a copy, I'm sure you can find the article online or you can possibly go to Newsweek's website and read the article there.<br /><br />~Cheers
B0091QS88K|4.0|My grandaughter loved this game. The only problem being the time it takes for the loading from one screen to another. A good way to entertain small ones during rainy days, other than the TV thing, which is not interactive nor educational, like this little game is.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Still Alice is one of the best books I've read in a long time.  Written by an author who is an expert in this general field, the book is well researched, though the timeline is more rapid that what is normal for EOA (acknowledged by the author).  The story is told from the main character's perspective, rather than caregivers' perspectives, which makes the story all the more compelling.  Alice moved me to tears more than once.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|Good storyline with great effects. The movie is a lot of fun to watch and recommend seeing in HD. If you have seen the previous Marvel comics movies, you will see how they all tie together. Watch the ending for a glimpse of the next movie.
B001Q4Z5UY|3.0|despite some good actors and brief hints at character development, the overall plot was so thin that it felt like I was watching a video game.<br />it is violent with lots of big visual effects.
B0039TAHMA|4.0|We cancelled our Netflix and are very happy with the choices available thru amazon. Good selection of free movies as well as rentals.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Amazing historical fiction that helped me understand political issues in several parts of the world.  I' m anxious to read book III.
B005K01VZS|4.0|I was raised in a Christian church, but for many years I have called myself an agnostic and have struggled with my faith and whether or not I believed that God is here or ever has been.  This book is just what I needed.  The story is lovely and I am inspired by the tolerant view toward those of other faiths.  My Kindle was a gift and this book was already downloaded when I got it.  I almost deleted it without reading it...I am very glad that I did not do that.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Honestly, this series is so good that when this book came out I reread the first Bared to You so I could continue on with the story through Relected in You. The third book coming in this series, I may reread from the first all the way through,,,,it is that captivating.
B002NFCHBA|4.0|It's a excelent package. Worth it ! All the interpretations seem to be correct, but some of them I'd expected more. Great names are in the package. The sound quality is good. Maybe the best set of Chopin's Complete Works. Again, Worth it !
B004RKXN44|5.0|It is sexy. It is lustful. It is danger. It is spell binding.<br /> I am waiting for the next book in this series to be written, please Nalini Singh hurry.
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|I never thought I'd get so into a show about Zombies!  This is in my top five favorite shows of all time.  I don't purchase many movies, and I never buy seasons of shows, but this is worth it!
B002LAM7PI|5.0|I like it when movies can be pretty creepy without being really scary.  For me this was the perfect halloween sort of movie.
0525952926|2.0|What a let down! I really enjoyed the first book and was looking forward to book 2. I was beyond disappointed. The book jumps from character to character and county to country. Many of the characters were unnecessary and /or boring. It leaves you not really caring whether they survived the war. Book 3 is a no go for me.
B001NLKWLW|4.0|Morton writes  beautiful old fashioned fairytales and weaves them expertly into the main story. The changes back and forth in time were a bit hard to follow, but the mystery of Nell's origins was done well. All in all, it was a good read.
B00742BVW8|5.0|This is not a typical start-to-finish plot; the story unfolds in retellings. What makes this film stand out so vividly, though, is the use of color, season, movement,and every visual nuance in the book to tell the story. The scene in the \\"red\\" section when the two female leads are fighting (in that stunningly beautiful sword-fighting style also seen in \\"Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon\\") is among the most beautiful things I've ever seen committed to film. The swirling leaves become part of the action and it's sheer visual poetry. The early fight scene in the rain is equally beautiful, with a stunning musical accompaniment.<br />The actors generally take a back seat to the visual poetry. And really, that's just fine. Watch this on the biggest screen you can find.
B000TGJ8AS|2.0|I was quite upset with the purchase of season 4, as I am an avid fan of NCIS, it was maddening to find that one of the DVD's was so scratched that I couldn't watch it, not to mention you can't return it, so be careful when buying movies and make sure that they can be returned. It is an excellent show but gets on my nerves with all the bashing that Tony and Ziva do to McGee. Im hoping that those two will be eliminated sometime in the near future.
B009NBSBSA|5.0|Great episode. Gives background on Rumpelstiltskin and Regina met.  I always enjoy any episode that gives more insight into Rumpelstiltskin's  motivation.
B00361R2VU|4.0|While by no means an incredible movie, I found it to be pretty enjoyable and relatively scary.  I put off watching it for years because some of the people I know hated it, said it was too slow etc.  I for one, do not understand what was slow about it, it's called a plot people...stuff happens enough to keep you on the edge of your seat.  I would recommend it to anyone who is not a baby about movies shot in this way.
B009SSGBOE|4.0|Another interesting and enjoyable solo work. Wonderful mix of blues and jazz with excellent vocal backing. If you enjoy Steely Dan or Donald Fagen's previous solo albums, this one is a definite must have.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A major page turner....it is 4am and I'm about to start book 2...I can't wait!!!! Held me captive and intrigued all the way!!!!
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Couldn't put them down over vacation. Hoping there will be a book four? These are great books that I can see myself reading again.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Well structured and chocked with useful info. Works silently in the background but pops up when I plug in. Cheers on a useful and versatile app that's not bogged down with junk.
B008QE9XD2|3.0|I was not thrilled by the video. Johnny Depp was great as always but the characters were to phony. Growing up I watched the series and this was a bad movie. It just didn't have the feeling of what I remember. It was good if all you wanted was laughs but I wan't impressed with it.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Read this in 3 days. It was well written and left me wanting more. Usually do not read trilogies until all are available because now I am impatiently waiting for the next book to come out.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|This game may start out easy, but it ramps up into a real challenge! Certainly worth the time! I haven't finished yet, but that's a long way off.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I had just gone to my state fair where they have live versions of this game with real coins you can win so I thought I would give this a try fully knowing that it could not be as satisfying.  Well this is now my go to game for simple pleasures!  I could probably play it for hours if I had enough coins but I refuse to buy any but still have managed to earn enough to play for 20 minutes straight if I choose. I love this game and am going to try some others from this vendor.
1451620829|4.0|I'm a huge fan of rock biographies, and this book was a real page turner.<br /><br />In short, Peter tells a compelling story about his life in and out of Kiss.  While I felt he whined a bit too much, I like him as a person and I wish him the best of luck in his future ventures.<br /><br />I also read Ace's book, and between Peter's book & Ace's book, I can't help but to love the train wreck of a person that is Ace Frehley.<br /><br />Not surprisingly, Gene and Paul come across as greedy & manipulative scumbags.<br /><br />When Ace & Paul were in Kiss, it was a band....with Thayer and Singer as replacements, Kiss is just a brand.<br /><br />Thanks you Peter Criss for writing a great book!
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This was a thoroughly engaging mystery with some surprise otherworldly components.  The objects searches were my least favorite part (my vision isn't up to the tiny objects) and the puzzles were my favorite.  I will be downloading another mystery game from the vendor<br />soon.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Loved the movie and love this sound track. Only complaint is that some of the mixes off the movie are missing. Having said that, this was still 100% worth the purchase.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|I really loved all the ALIEN movies so I was very excited about this supposed prequel and although some of the questions are resolved the plot just creates more questions.  One of the problems with this film is the decisions that the characters make have me feeling that the people of the future are not as smart as now but the special effects are impressive and it's great to see the some of the artistry of H.R. Giger again.
B0085FS5XG|5.0|A heavy, melodic album. For lovers of Testament...it's a must have. For metal-heads everywhere...check it out; you won't be<br />disappointed. The lyrics are deep and poignant, the drummer is an absolute master of his craft, and the guitars will shred<br />your face off. BUY THIS ALBUM!
B0088EDMMS|5.0|Without a doubt, this has been, and always will be one of my favourite movies of all time. Bette Midler is just hilarious, and her rendition of \\"I Put a Spell on You\\" is just so much fun. I watch this movie every year with my friends, and sometimes when we are just in the mood.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is the best thing ever! I love all the extra stuff like your horoscope! I wish I had this when I was younger because I can not spell to save my life! I think everyone should have this app!
B005LVR6ZA|1.0|I am sorry if this upsets the author but I found Ubik to be a very confusing and jumbled book that makes me wonder why in the world I even bothered to read it all the way through. A real imagination went into making it, however.
B000FCK9CW|4.0|I really liked this story. My favorite is The Secret Advisory, Tommy & Tuppence. But this story was entertaining and kept my interest.
B009KUANWG|5.0|I am a HUGE James Bond fan, I have seen all 22 movies, and I have read most of the books. I am completely enamored with Connery's turn as Bond, and I happen to think that Shirley Bassey gave us some of the most compelling themes. You Know My Name was a good song to start off the Craig era, but Another Way to Die was a lackluster outing. I am very excited about Adele's song, and I can't wait to see Skyfall this Thurday.
B000SP1SH6|5.0|One of Bill Murray's best. Has the great line \\"What if there's no tomorrow, there wasn't one today.\\" I can watch this again, and again, and again... Reminds me of the lives some people lead - and can learn from.
B004IDG97S|3.0|I like dumb obvious action movies, but this one is just too much. Usually, I can be VERY forgiving when it comes to acting and plot, but Stallone really just took this to a whole other level. While it is an entertaining film, I can't really justify buying it. I really just watched this movie because I watched Dredd 3D, and I wanted to see how this film held-up in comparison to this one. Dredd 3D is much better. And, as I understand it, quite a bit more faithful to the comic than this one.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Interesting writing style and story line that quickly draws you in. Each chapter provides alternating views from the perspectives of the main characters. An enjoyable read for anyone that appreciates a fast moving story with some twists and turns.
B007EECSFA|3.0|I have thoroughly enjoyed all the other Kate Morton Books, but I found this one a trifle- tedious.  it alternates between the past and present - as do all her books - but it just didn't grab me at first. It does pick up about half way through and at that point I found it got much more interesting.  I couldn't get really interested in the characters until then.
B0098VYCCE|5.0|I wanted to see this movie but had read a a lot of bad reveiws. Well they were wrong while it's not going to win an academy award it is a very good movie
B00632HWOG|4.0|I'm very pleased with the Yahoo email app. I really couldn't or wouldn't be without it. I check my email each evening long after I shut the computer down & many times I find things in there that need my attention right away. This app lets me do that.
B004QX07G4|4.0|I LOVE Ellen Degeneres, always have.  I've never read one of her books.  This was a cute book and caused a few chuckles - I've always been able to relate to her humor.  With the limited amount of time I have to read these days, not sure that I would choose another of her books.  No complaints at all, but I would likely choose a David Sedaris or Augusten Burroughs if they came out with something new.  If I'm going to read comedy, there is nothing better than David Sedaris.  But I'll always love Ellen Degeneres!

B003K1EYM6|5.0|I love it; had no idea there was such a thing till a friend pulled hers out on vacation. As I've only used it 2x I get mixed up with which one works for my camera...so I'll put away the one I don't use! I like being able to view pics larger on my I-pad and to show others.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|I love this game.  Never have to \\"purchase \\" coins.  Works well on the kindle fire.  I wish a few changes were made :  1.  Puzzles pieces would drop faster.  2.  You could sell or trade prizes for another color.  I am on level 92 and still have not  gotten an umbrella of a certain color but I have 6 of one color.  3.  That the doser moved faster.  I don't know how you receive doser dollars.
B007VT6QSI|4.0|Justin Bieber is one of those people of whom I've been peripherally aware, but didn't really know anything about musically up until recently. I'd catch the occasional interview on TV and, to me, he always came off as a total poseur who seemed more concerned with what angle the camera was catching him from than with actually having anything interesting to say. However, I am a fan of pop/dance music, and as I heard more and more songs from his Believe album it occurred to me that it just might be right up my alley after all. So I bought it, gave it a chance, and I have to honestly say that it's probably one of the better albums I've heard this last year.<br /><br />That's not to say this is the most profound record you'll ever hear, lol. It's true he croons the word \\"girl\\" about once every three seconds, but as pop music goes these days, it really is pretty catchy and Bieber genuinely does have a good voice from a technical standpoint. Plus he shares writing credit, which is admirable. I won't get into a long-winded track by track review, but there are definitely a few standouts worth highlighting. \\"All Around the World\\" is a straightforward, thumping dance track and a great way to open the disc. \\"Boyfriend\\" is a low-key, mellow R&B groove reminiscent of the kinds of songs bands like Nsync were putting out in the mid or late 90's, which is kind of a nice throwback. \\"As Long as You Love Me\\" is a midtempo electro jam with some unique dubstep effects and  interesting vocal layering. (I could have done without the obnoxious rap interlude from Big Sean, though.) \\"Beauty and a Beat\\" is a personal favorite that nearly ventures into techno territory, and as much as I would normally disdain Nicki Minaj, she's featured in a rap interlude that is so ridiculously wacky you really do need to hear it to believe it. \\"Catching Feelings\\" is one of the better ballads and totally single-worthy, with a folksy vibe and smooth vocals that bring to mind a young Michael Jackson. There are few tracks around the middle of the CD that don't really stand out one way or the other and could probably best be summed up as filler, but the only song I'd flat out say I don't like is \\"Right Here,\\" mostly because Drake's singing is pretty darn awful, to be perfectly frank. The album closes with the title track, \\"Believe,\\" which is an uplifting number with gospel influences.<br /><br />As I indicated in my first paragraph, odds are slim that Justin Bieber and I would be friends in real life. But, I need to give credit where credit is due and admit he's got some real talent beneath the contrived pseudo-gangsta act. While not necessarily moved to go out and purchase everything he's done before, my interest is piqued enough to want to see where this may all be going in the future. Hopefully as time passes he'll evolve into his own skin, drop all pretenses of what he thinks his image should be, and just be comfortable doing what he loves to do and saying what he wants to say. We see hints of it already on Believe, and if nothing else comes of it, the album has established him as a credible pop artist in the here and now with a little something to offer all demographics.w tracks around the middle of the CD that don't really stand out one way or the other and could probably best be summed up as filler, but the only song I'd flat out say I don't like is \\"Right Here,\\" mostly because Drake's singing is pretty darn awful, to be perfectly frank.

B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This game is challenging and fun. Beautiful scenery.  I love playing. Its not too competitive and I like that. Wish more games were like this one.
B007D2XSW0|5.0|My new phone didn't have the photo features I like so I downloaded this app its perfect! I can make everyone pretty now!!
B009NF54ZE|3.0|Nevosoft always has great graphics and usually a good story line. I found this game a little boring, as it had too much dialect. The number of matching and difference games far exceed the hidden object ones. I wanted to love this game...hopefully the next in the series will be better.
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I enjoyed the book...I was getting upset during my read but it was so worth it...I wish it would have ended differently.
B005XN31LY|5.0|This was a wonderful show that my whole family could watch and get into. Really enjoyed it and love that we own it and can watch it whenever we choose, on any device, even on the go.
B000FBFN1U|3.0|I'd have to rewrite the review of the previous parts here. It basically keeps you looking for more, doesn't bore you!!<br />On to the 4th...
B007KOYEOC|4.0|This was the best of the three books, loved the suspense captured well with an under-current of double meaning. Tugged at the heart strings, love a happy ending. Loved the extra at the end, tied everything up beautifully.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|So granted, the writing is still great and the overall plot is still thickening. No loss of interest there.<br />The thing that bugs you in this part is how slow the events are moving... the message George leaves at the end kind of clarifies this a bit, and you go like: ohhhh ok! But still, the chapters feel so much longer and the story moves at a drastically slow pace.<br />The characters focused on here are relatively \\"new\\" and you feel like you don't have a strong connection to them as you did to the previous ones!
B008NR91DO|5.0|I am a huge Gary Moore fan. Although this does not show his song writing skills, it does show that he was a master of the electric guitar, all genres. I have heard him play blues, rock, jazz, heavy metal & more. He plays Jimi just as Jimi played Jimi. The songs pay homage to the one that started it all.
0345803485|1.0|Everything in this book reminds of characters in Twilight: handsome guy, clumsy girl, location: Seattle, the guy has a dark side and so on. In addition, it was just too much sex .... it gets old. I don't recommend this book.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I wasn't sure just what to expect from this book.  I am an HP fan and was willing to give it a try out of curiousity.  It was well written and the characters were interesting.  If she wrote another, I'd buy it.
B0084AZXKK|2.0|This book is really confusing. I got lost a lot in it. It doesn't really make any sense and it is kind of a band book.
B005IA9JZO|5.0|Just a great movie for all ages. Family friendly, funny, entertaining, heartwarming and an all round fun movie! The Blu-ray DVD combo makes for great versatility in watching options. The Blu-ray high definition looks great (considering the last time I watched the movie was on VHS).

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A great twist to the ending!  Although, Katniss is portrayed with such strength during the first two, it was disappointing to have her such an emotional wreck at the end.  But still a great book and great story!
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I know there was a lot of criticism that Ridley Scott just made another Alien movie, which is true, but it was a really good movie. Really awesome special effects and I really enjoyed watching it.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Done well enough to hold my interest and look forward to a sequel.  Special effects also very entertaining.  Excellent acting and believable.
B009RI4FRU|5.0|Really wonderful unique movie! Well worth watching. All the characters are just so entertaining to watch. The scenes with Edward Norton and Bruce Willis at the switchboard were priceless.
B0095R64AO|1.0|This movie went on and on. I thought it would be funny but it wasnt. It mostly just had an unending plot line with no climax and no humor. I feel like I wasted 3 hours of my life I will never get back.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|I rented this movie after not seeing it in the theater. I really enjoyed it, i did not love it though. it was a sweet wes anderson film.
B000IK8JTG|4.0|The music is haunting, the moors desolate and Ralph Feinnes mesmorizing in the role of Heathcliff.  Juliet Binoche is a bit tepid as Cathy--but I enjoyed this film very much.
0385484518|5.0|This is a great book to read. You can apply the lessons and experiences to your own life. It's paced very well and the characters are  described greatly.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Good app with very few issues. I would definately recommend! Hope the latest update fixes anything that was a problem before.

B009RIMRDE|5.0|This episode is one of my favorites for the season. It is set in the Hamptons, specifically Castle's house and shows a lot of Castle and Beckett's fledgling relationship.  Definitely check it out.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I love TeamLava's &quot;Story&quot; games but this one is mediocre at best. It's very slow and tedious to level up and the only way to get gold is to add neighbors and hope they gift it or through in app purchases. Game is also rather glitchy, randomly shutting down and never letting me gift gold to neighbors so they will return the favor. Very subpar for TeamLava. :(
B009NQDCKC|5.0|Watching Castle is like watching a good novel unfold on TV. This episode was very well written and I would highly rec to everyone.
B006LSZECO|4.0|An  unusual  pair of characters with a similar But divergent Direction that makes it difficult to  empathize with, ending with not liking either one at the end.
B006XF5BTG|1.0|COMPLETELY USELESS BOOK THAT GIVES NOTHING NEW, AND ACTUALLY SUGGEST A VERY DANGEROUS APPROACH OF CONSTANTLY GAINING AND LOOSING WEIGHT !!!!
B007THA4FI|2.0|When I started reading The Casual Vacancy I was excited by the level of writing, the detail to character development and building suspense. But so far, at over half way through, has not progressed beyond this basic scene setting phase.  Hopefully it picks up in the last half!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I have to spend alot of time in bed and I'm easily bored.  But i play this game every day for hours at a time. No one is using mu kindle. Get this it is fun for 8yr-80yrs.
B005LAIH4A|1.0|My opinion of The Lorax stayed in flux as I watched the movie unravel.  Sometimes I cringed at how heavy-handed they were with Dr. Seuss' simple message, sometimes I was just dismayed by the overabundance of nasty characters they invented and imposed upon his story.  Too many times I wondered where Dr. Seuss was in this messy adaptation of his book.  He seemed to be missing.  The reason for this became clear in the bonus feature.  Apparently, the filmmakers felt it necessary to attach things not Seuss to the story because it was somehow deficient as it was; requiring their extensions.  One of them even had the gall to call it a homage.  But tampering is tampering; clearly they were dissatisfied with most things in the book, especially the notion of having to adapt Seuss' two-dimensional drawings into......two-dimensional drawings in motion.  A lot of work was required to \\"make them come alive.\\"  Again, a slur against Dr. Seuss' work.  If they didn't like the book, why bring it to the screen?  Why add dopey songs that were less than memorable and subvert the plot?  Why ignore the language, what makes Seuss' work so distinctive?  There was a reason Dr. Seuss kept his book somber from page one to the end.  His point was concise, not easily forgotten.  But they had to turn everything into a carnival atmosphere complete with slapstick, a romance, a city, and another villain that wasn't even required.  When you overhaul someone else's work to this degree you're not honoring their work, you're desecrating it.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|DeMille is probably my favorite author, and this book is definitely up to his standards. Hope he is at his computer writing another one!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Love John Corey----especially the things he DOESN'T SAY!  Can't wait for him to catch up with Chet and Buck...hope Mr. DeMille makes 2 books out of it!
B009NQKXYK|5.0|The movie effects and plot was very good. The shape of the alien ship was very well hidden till almost the end of the movie. The acting was excellent as well. Another Ridley Scott triumph!

B0052RDHTM|3.0|This book is interesting, but is more of a romance novel than the epic it purports to be. I haven't given up on it yet, but it hasn't really met my expectations.
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have been a long time fan of Childs books and love Jack Reacher. This was another good story but not his best. I found it a little boring in spots but all in all a good read.
B0062KMDZ2|1.0|Only Hollywood could turn a campy Jules Verne masterpiece into something so incredibly boring! Where's the story? It just vanished into thin air. You certainly have plenty of acting talent. It's too bad it was wasted on such a vapid screenplay. And the sets are colorful. But that's about it! Watching this movie is about as exciting as watching planes land and take-off at an airport. Sure some people may find that exciting, but most people don't.<br /><br />If I had to sum up this film, I would say it lack's heart. The writer's of the screenplay certainly went out of their way NOT to do, or say, absolutely anything to offend anyone! This is the ultimate perfect film for small children. It's so plain vanilla, parents will have nothing to worry about! Unfortunately, for the rest of us, it wasn't marketed as a children's only film!<br /><br />I don't expect a Jules Verne story to make sense - it's a delightful fantasy. But the versions I remember as a child & teen had very convincing passion and a lot of imagination. Memo to Hollywood: When you make the next remake sometime in the next twenty years, dump the plain vanilla into the compost bin, and take walk on the wild side! See: [[ASIN:080214201X Vanilla: Travels in Search of the Ice Cream Orchid]]
B008XG1X18|5.0|This is a very helpful app!!  You really can find anything you want or need, there are even things you didn't know you wanted.
B006WXHJNU|1.0|It's a bad sign when you hear members of the audience groan! But its not hard to figure out why! This movie was marketed as appropriate for adult audiences, but it's actually an annoying story written for ten-year-olds!<br /><br />It's been a long time since I seen such a boring and tedious film! Even Iron Man with all its many flaws was better than this sorry story! And what's up with Edward Norton? His acting was so bad it felt like he was reading off of a teleprompter! It was incredibly distracting. Was he drugged, or something? - One things for certain: Bill Bixby, he ain't!<br /><br />I also got a laugh out of Hollywood thinking an American audience is so dumb about world geography they would believe the teeming slums of some major city in Brazil is next to the Guatemalan/Mexican border! - Let's say you are in Northern Brazil. To make it to the Guatemalan/Mexican border you have to go through either Venezuela, Columbia or both! Then you must cross through Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua and then Honduras. Quite a distance! But the Incredible Hulk, who has neither wings, nor magic, nor teleporting abilities or a private jet, makes it all the way to the Guatemalan/Mexican border in less than a night!<br /><br />Memo to Hollywood: I know you're going for the quick buck after losing so much money during the Writer's Strike! There have been so many awful movies this past Spring (2008) that I'm getting worn out! But I'm an optimistic person. Could you please, please, make your next Comic Book related film as brilliant as Spiderman #3, X-Men #2, or as good as any of the six Star Wars films? Is that asking too much? There are adults who like a good story just as much as you (Hollywood) like to make a ton of money!<br /><br />See: [[ASIN:1931397155 Trail Guide To World Geography (Geography Matters)]], and [[ASIN:1741049237 South America: On a Shoestring (Shoestring Travel Guide)]], and [[ASIN:0195121872 The Slum (Library of Latin America)]]

B001BPJJ82|1.0|I give each and every film the benefit of the doubt! What troubles me so greatly is that The Fall starts out as delightful - and then turns into something very ugly!<br /><br />Keep in mind this about an innocent - and rather naive child - somewhere between 8-10 years of age. She is manipulated into assisting an attempted suicide. This is no potential mercy killing, either! It's about a grown man who will descend into the pits of hell to emotionally scar a rather vulnerable child. He has no self-control or conscience! All he cares about is killing himself, so why worry about collateral damage!<br /><br />Nor is this some backwater hospital. It's state of the art for the 1920's! Where famous people and orange-harvesting, migrant workers cross paths. But this \\"modern\\" hospital lets a young child run around with impunity, literally sharing a bed with middle aged man who is known to the hospital staff as suicidal. Hey, but its the 1920's and this crazy non-sense doesn't raise so-much as an eyebrow!<br /><br />But when the child, who may have fractured her skull from falling - because she made a second attempt to raid the morphine in an unlocked and unguarded pharmacy - we get to watch this very disturbed man turn his delightful story - that he created from thin air - into a nightmare of gruesome death and destruction. To add insult to injury, we then get to see our young hero start crying hysterically while lying trapped in a hospital bed, no-less, totally at the mercy of this lunatic! If this is not psychological child abuse, I don't know what is!<br /><br />At this point, I said to myself, doesn't this young child actor have any parents? How could they let their rather young daughter act in such a twisted movie? Isn't this a form of exploitation?<br /><br />My next thought was: \\"This is such a sadistic story, and I paid my hard earned money to watch this unmerciful, pain-inflicting non-sense.\\" I don't know about you, but that's not my idea of entertainment!<br /><br />My only consolation is this god-awful film ran in only 1 obscure movie theater in a metropolitan area of well over a million people! Hopefully the Hollywood crew who put this nightmare of a film on the big screen will not make a penny for their efforts!<br /><br />See:[[ASIN:002903082X Recognizing Child Abuse: A Guide For The Concerned]] and [[ASIN:0618246223 This Is a Hospital, Not a Zoo!]], and [[ASIN:059540023X Better Living Through Bad Movies]] and most importantly, [[ASIN:B001UQO3YM Hospital Stay Handbook: A Guide to Becoming a Patient Advocate for Your Loved Ones]]>My only consolation is this god-awful film ran in only 1 obscure movie theater in a metropolitan area of well over a million people!

B0083GQVXI|5.0|I do need to say up front that I'm a big Tilda Swinton fan, and tend to enjoy just about anything she is in. Like so many of her films, We Need to Talk about Kevin challenges viewers to enter difficult places. I think this film works well on several levels--psychological drama, horror (comparisons with Rosemary's Baby are right on, I think), cultural/social critique. It examines questions of Motherhood and Family and the ways that social expectations can potentially exasperate personality tendencies to end in tragic ways. It is perhaps on this level--the level of ideological critique--that I found myself most engaged, but I was equally impressed with the acting, and the way the individual characters are developed in meaningful and complex ways. I think the adaptation from the novel was pretty brilliant, liked the pacing and cinematography, and look forward to seeing more of Ramsay's films. Very haunting, perhaps at times a bit lurid, but a different kind of horror film, building through suspense and avoiding the cliches of a slasher film.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|This book was a good read, hard to put down at times.  Some of the grammar was awkward, but it was written by Jaycee, so it's in her wording. I'm glad I read it.
B0006Z2KXE|5.0|It's become more difficult to justify purchasing a DVD rather than just downloading a movie. Well, this two-disc presentation of the classic movie, THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, justifies itself. The movie itself, of course, is wonderful (how can you beat Grant/Hepburn/Stewart?). But it's the extras that really made it special.<br /><br />First up was the Katharine Hepburn documentary, made toward the end of her life. Now, I've never been a Hepburn fan, but this poignant documentary changed all of that. She talks about herself, her movies, her life, and her passions. When she went on about Spencer Tracy, we all looked at each other and realized we had tears in our eyes. Whole new respect for that actress.<br /><br />Then there was a topnotch documentary on the director George Cukor.<br /><br />Then there's a funny Robert Benchley short. This is the best one I've seen from him, as it focuses on how men refuse to ask for help or directions. We went from tears to overwhelming laughter very quickly!<br /><br />Then it was on to THE HOMELESS FLEA, an MGM cartoon from the golden age of animation. You just don't see this type of artistry anymore.<br /><br />Finally, there are two radio programs featuring the stars in the same roles. James Stewart is introduced as Lieutenant James Stewart, reminding one that this all took place during the greatest conflict of the last century.<br /><br />This was the equivalent of going to a retro single screen moviehouse and getting the animated feature, the short, and the documentary, PLUS the headlining film. Very enjoyable and a big thumbs up! Get the popcorn popped!

B00406UK7S|3.0|\\"Centurion\\" seems to be a movie that missed the epic scale that the director was looking for.  There are vast sprawling areas throughout the movie, however, in the end, the film only seems to be a drawn out chase sequence.<br /><br />Stranded behind enemy lines, a small group of Roman soldiers are hunted by a band of Celtic Picts through the unforgiving Scottish landscape.  Along the way there are beheadings, dismemberments, random acts of mutilation, and a whole hell of a lot of running through the wilderness.<br /><br />Although Michael Fassbender and Dominic West give tremendous performances, the rest of the cast leaves the audience with unmemorable characters, who will more than likely be forgotten by the time the credits role.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the saving grace within this film is the beautiful scenery.  The shots are extremely well done and I found myself watching the scraggly landscapes of white, blue, green and gray, more often than watching the actual actors on screen.  The crimson blood that spews across the screen only accentuates the wilderness that these men find them selves in.  The film is captured within long shots (aerial shots, crane shots, distant tracking shots, creeping-up-over-ledge shots, and shots that seem to go on for miles).  It is truly fantastic, some of the scenes reminded me of the vastness within \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" films.  I recommend this film for the cinematography if nothing else.<br /><br />I give \\"Centurion\\" three out of five stars.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is one of the best books I ever read!!  I could not put this book down.

1442359315|5.0|I enjoy NDE stories.  This one is exactly as described.  Dr. Eben Alexander gives specifics on not only his NDE experience but also on the very unique and well-documented medical details of his death experience and miraculous recovery.  His experience as both a neurosurgeon and a voyager into the NDE realm is unique and offers powerful evidence that there is scientific value in exploring these phenomena.  I very much enjoyed his story and his logical reasoning that further research into the NDE experience is vital to the advance of scientific understanding.  The presentation is exactly as promised in the book's description.  As usual, for me, I was left wanting more about the NDE details - I never can get enough description of the other worldly details when I hear these stories.  If Dr. Alexander publishes a follow up with more details about his personal NDE experience and his interpretations around that experience, I'll be first in line buy it.
B009OZ690C|4.0|If for no other reason, this episode of Supernatural should be watched for Jensen Ackles' performance.  He is rocking Dean Winchester this season, now that he has some meat to work with.  The Purgatory scenes with him and his vampire friend, Benny (Ty Ollson) are excellent acting, lighting, and editing.  The episode was good for setting up the mytharc for this season.  Supernatural is an awesome TV series with very talented people, both acting and production, working on it.  I wouldn't miss it, and I'm not a big TV or sci-fi/horror fan.  This one I like, though.
B007FG9LIE|1.0|What you think might be intrigue and mystery turns out to be fantasy and Scifi....Just not my bag.  Needs to be a bit believable, but falls short.  Perhaps for early junior high.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|This was a good read; gave it only 4 stars because of the abundance of technical terminology (I don't need to learn how to be a pathologist).  Plot was well laid out and characters were well developed. The end provided twists and surprises.
B0098VXN2Y|3.0|The movie was entertaining but it was very predictable. If you don't have anything to do on a rainy Saturday or Sunday afternoon, this would be a good pick. Just not worth paying full theatre prices.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this entire book in one sitting, it was a very moving story. It was not my usual reading material either which makes it all the  more interesting that I read it all at one time.  I am going to have to see the movie now and read another book.
B0063IH60K|3.0|can be boring after awhile. the multiplayer feature is not as friendly as I thought it would be. the other person just plays and you don't have a sense of what is happening until the game is abruptly over.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|one of his poorest novels. he has gotton carried away on terroist tales and there are way too many jokes in this novel
B008YRVW0I|5.0|Great game. It's almost as if you get 2 games in one. It's like bejeweled meets insaniquarium (minus the monsters.
0345803507|2.0|I must say I struggled getting through this one. I was not a huge fan of the first two but wanted to see how the story turned out. It was far fetched and repetitive. Really not worth the hype
B0060I0IG2|3.0|Riccardo Chailly's recent Beethoven cycle is boisterous, lively, aggressive, and above all, loud.  This is in no small part due to Decca's sound mix, which places this recording in sync with today's popular music: a loud mix to the point of saturation, with much less dynamic range than one would expect from this premier record label.<br /><br />Perhaps it suits Chailly's approach though. His Beethoven is certainly not for the fainthearted, with its quick tempos and aggressive entrances, and general lack of subtlety.<br /><br />One doubts that the Decca sound pioneers such as John Culshaw would have mixed these recordings in this way, but then again Decca (along with DG and Philips) are not really the unique record labels they once were. They are now just imprints of the mighty Universal Music Group.<br /><br />This set is still worth hearing (the Gewandhaus lays claim as the \\"original\\" Beethoven orchestra after all), but don't expect the classic \\"Decca sound\\".
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game can entertain me if I'm bored and I like all the combinations of dragons I can make. I would recommend people to get this. ^-^
B009NQKXYK|4.0|I liked this movie, it has a great cast and is full of action in a spectacular special effect way.<br />I love the opening scene at the waterfall, also love the spaceship. I downloaded to my new Fire HD and enjoyed 2+ hours of suspended dis-belief.<br />I think as this movie is so open ended that a sequel is coming soon.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I like this game because. I can go to a lot of places fight monster buy weapons have a team. an have fun.order and chosa rocks!
B008MM9630|4.0|This game is good but the expansions take too long and cost too much. The graphics are really a lot of fun.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|Very good, makes my knives very sharp including the two different knife sharpeners for smooth blades and one for a serrated blade.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|I usually don't submit reviews, but I really enjoyed this movie!!!! Not going to spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but kudos to the Hulk for his admiration of the \\"demi-god\\". lol  Adding this to my Marvel dvd collection....
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like this game.  fun I would buy this.<br />keeps me entertained when I'm bored.  I would recommend this game.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|A great continuation from the first book. Just when I thought the story was going to wrap up, it hooks you in the next books. Very good read.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Great book. So much history and you really get to know the characters throughout the series. I loved the way Ken Follett writes and you really get to know the era and the characters well. The first book of the series is from the World War 1 Era. This one follows into World War 2 and follows different people in different countries all intertwined in the war effort.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I liked it but at the same time thought it was a bit messed up. It had lots of twists and turns in the book and definitely ended with an unexpected ending. I really liked how the story went back and forth between the characters but it got a little confusing a few times as to when things were taking place because it also went back in forth in time.
B008YZXYY2|4.0|This band has shifted gears since their second album, Audio Secrecy was more Alternative than their first two albums and this one although better than the last one,still isn't them. The album is a concept and I dig the cover of the album but the songs are kinda generic Alternative Rock/Metal but not Stone Sour. This album has some good songs but nothing that stands out really. I comprehend the maturer albums and stuff but sometimes it's best to mix it up with what started and not discard it.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|Started this series after reading Ender's game series. Loved it even more. The story was really interesting and kept me hooked throughout the read. I couldn't wait to read the second one when I was done
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I wanted to revoke all of my previous 5 star rated books just to prove how special this one is.
B004JN1CW4|5.0|Loved it, it was a little slower paced than the first two, thought that it dragged on longer than it needed to, but over all a great story. Keeps you hooked in.
B008CJ0JPC|5.0|Criterion truly stands for quality in every way possible. The transfer and the new sound mix both are fantastic, the commentary (featuring Director David Fincher as well as actor Michael Douglas) was thorough and interesting. Cult-filmmaker Fincher's \\"The Game\\" is the rare kind of movie that was way ahead of it's time when it was released theatrically more than 10 years ago. When confused people scratch their heads at the end of a feature, two things can happen: the film will be well remembered or quickly forgotten. The good thing about \\"The Game\\" is, it's not that confusing or complicated IF you really pay attention to what's going on. Criterion gives that little gem of a movie exactly the treatment that it rightfully deserves, including the right amount of special features and all of it presented in the right way. Thank you Criterion !
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app. It tells you if your message was recieved, and it tells when they are typing. One thing I wish they would upgrade.. MAKE US ABLE TO SEND VIDEOS.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|if you liked the first game eternity warriors. you'll love this... you have new wpons, newpowers, and new enimys. its awesome.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I enjoyed Reflected In You as much as I did Bared To You.  The storyline is hot, sexy and fun.  The characters are over the top beautiful and rich which makes the fantasy all the more enjoyable.  While the story approaches the darker element of childhood abuse, it's true purpose is to entertain the reader and, thus, it resolves everything quickly, neatly and conveniently.  It is what it is: a romantic, sexy fantasy.  Nothing more, nothing less.  I loved it and can't wait for the next book in the series, Entwined With You!
B0059XTTW8|5.0|I love this movie. I watched it 5 times and I can't wait to watch it again. \\"wicked wicked George.\\"
B0053O89U6|5.0|If you have never seen Modern Family you need to buy all three seasons now and be prepared to laugh your head off.  There is a reason this show has won so many Emmy awards.  The writing is phenomenal and the cast is extremely talented.  You will fall in love with each character.  We watch episodes over and over and catch new lines we missed every time.  If you love to laugh Modern Family is for you.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|addicting!!! this is a great game that is sometimes challenging but mostly funn! you should totes get it! most deff!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|Wonderfully plotted and acted by one of the best ensembles<br />around, almost a who's who of British telly and theatre.<br />Great catchline: \\"Everything will be all right in the end,<br />so if it is not all right, then it is not yet the end...\\"
0500543933|3.0|I am in two minds about this book. I dig a lot of the photos... but there are also quite a few which do nothing for me. The good news is that this is a big thick book (240 pages) with a good variety of photos, so if you are interested in this type of photography then chances are there are enough cool photos to make it worth getting. Personnally I like the harder hitting shots which give you a sense of peoples lives in various citys, rather than the \\"humorous\\" shots (many of which are just slightly comical juxtapositions). Another good thing about this book is  that theres tons to read. Hows this for a good quote (from an Aussie guy called Trent Parke) - 'I am forever chasing light. Light turns the ordinary into the magical'.
B009AJD5E0|4.0|I'm a lifelong devotee of the Alien franchise and I wasn't sure what to expect after such a long break. I must say, I was quite impressed. Prometheus has all the creepy horror of the past films, but delves further into the weird psychological aspects of that universe as it explores the origins of the xenomorphs Ripley fought, as well as other related creatures. Rumor is that the next film, if there is one, will take off on a completely different story branch - not the one that begins with the birth of the first Alien as we know it, late in this movie, but something new and unexpected. Fingers are crossed!
B002V092M4|3.0|This story is an intriguing and complex narrative that is often made confusing in the Kindle edition by the absence of appropriate formatting to indicate when the story shifts to resume plots revolving around other characters.  It is disappointing that the experience of reading this excellent story for the first time is diminished by the poor standard of electronic formatting.
B0091REZMW|4.0|this is a fun game, very addictive, the graphics are cool. interesting characters and interactions. down side is, if you want to play for an extended period you have to use real money, otherwise it is a great game.
B003V5CFV8|5.0|Great for kids and adults alike. The Brothers have done it again. Funny and charming this movie keeps your interest every second of the film. So many great actors make this movie even more amazing. Love the music, people, plot, everything about it really!!!
B007THA4FI|1.0|I found this book to be very slow and  boring and did not read past the first 3 chapters. I saved it to Archives and perhaps will go back and finish reading it at another time. marilyn anthony
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Kyle does a great job of detailing his service as a sniper.  A great read that kept me captivating and wanting to read more.  I also like the way that Kyle gives credit to those around him rather than himself despite the fact that he has the most confirmed sniper kills of anyone in the United States Armed Forces.  A big thank you to all the men and women that serve to protect this country.
B00846REIS|4.0|I started reading this style of romance after getting hooked on 50 Shades of Grey.  This series is a lot more complex that I thought it would be when I began reading them and as a result I would recommend for pure escapism with a twist.  I am not sure how the author will resolve what she has started here, but I hope it doesn't become predictable.  I actually had a few moments where there I was surprised.
0740748475|5.0|It was and is incredible. Hours and hours of reading entertainment. Nice to have in such good quality binding and box. Will have forever!
B009SSGBOE|5.0|Donald sounds great on these cuts, he is obviously well vaccinated against the honkey pox. This is some pretty funky stuff. Very catchy hooks and, as always, super clean production. This album may not have the hits that Aja had, nor even Nightfly, but it is musically just as strong as any of Donald's work, including the work released as Steely Dan. Michael Leonhart and the incomparable Jon Herington shine (shine shine) as featured soloists, along with several very nice solos from Donald himself. If you like blue eyed funk, the work of Steely Dan and/or Donald Fagen or masterful production values, buy this and settle down to listen to it several times in a row. It is THAT kind of recording.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Awesome movie, one of the best superhero movies I've seen, second only to Batman. A most get Movie. Two thumbs way up.
0380730405|5.0|I bought the book used and in \\"fair\\" condition - and it was in better shape than I anticipated.  It was almost great having the binding already bent and ready to settle in for the read.  This book is WONDERFUL.  I couldn't put it down.  Got it for a book club and loved every minute of it.  I'd recommend it - and definitely would trust the site with a used book.
B000NDMRCS|4.0|This was a great movie my kids also liked it. To quote my middle son who is -10\\"best disaster movie I have ever seen\\". A definite must watch.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I read this because I had read previous books by Ken Follett including Book One of the Century Trilogy. The level of detail and intricacy of the intersecting charactors and historical events brings this book to life. As a bonus you can see our present and our future in the events of the past described and why they occurred.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|I'm a fan and this book is good, not the best one, but pretty good. Can't wait for the next episode.
B0078XHAB4|5.0|This book is wonderful....fascinating characters and a supernatural edge. I started it on a lazy Sunday afternoon and couldn‘t wait to get home from work on Monday to finish it.
B008OOYALE|1.0|Not all devices have the same version of the game. Check the online forum for information to see if the operating system of your device can access the full version of the game.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I so enjoy her books and this one is very good so far.  Haven't finished it yet but will this week.
B009RI4FRU|4.0|we enjoyed it. im a huge wes anderson fan. ill watch it again. longer rental time would have been nice to watch again
B007MB5OCE|3.0|The idea of a centenarian escaping from his birthday celebration is novel.  The story intrigues until midway through the book, at which time there develop some tedious political situations.  Maybe it's the current (USA) political contentiousness, but I found this middle section too heavy to slog through.  May skip to later chapters.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Having read the Harry Potter series and using that base to compare with the movie, I was not disappointed.  While a movie cannot include everything in the book, this movie followed the overall plot closely enough to be quite enjoyable.  The craftsmanship in the special effects used was of high caliber.  I have enjoyed watching the entire series on several occasions.  It is one of those series that you wish could continue.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I started watching this movie with reservation about the team of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp. The dual have a reputation of pushing the story line to an extreme artistic limit.<br />The movie surprised me and with exceptionally acted and directed. This may have been Tim Burton's best Movie. The acting and story line was beyond my expectation. Excellent movie all around.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Marvel's The Avengers was everything I expected it to be.  I was extremely pleased by the special effects in the movie.  The story line was well developed as a beginning team comprised of individuals with their own special skills finally coming together in a cohesive unit to battle a common foe.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|I'm a Sci-Fi fanatic. The story line was interesting to follow. The special effects were great. They can't compare to other special effects but they were enough to support the movie. The movie was worth the money and time to watch.
0765328321|5.0|I'm a big fan on the game series and really enjoying this book.<br />The details are accurate to the rest of the story and games, it adds a lot to the history of John-117 and the Spartans.<br />Overall: 5/5
B000SEGUDE|2.0|I guess I'm just not much of a reader any more, because I still haven't gotten past chapter three.  The writing style of this book is very hard for me to get into.  Somehow reminds me of James Fenimore Cooper (that I also couldn't get into when I was in high school).
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|Younger group might not \\"get it\\". This was an inspirational read with thought-provoking moments, enlightening moments, and a great ending!
B009NQKXYK|4.0|Loved the special effects !! The movie looks great in HD !! Highly recommended for anyone who loves the Aliens movies.
B0099G4Y26|4.0|I loved the album! Only thing I didn't like so much was the content wasn't as empowering to the younger generation as in past albums. Hence only 4 stars.
B006DRVFRQ|3.0|Nice interface and it works well with my KF. unfortunately it's REALLY slow... as in force closing and waiting for a few minutes to load the comments (which you've viewed on the computer and know there are thirty of) and the gReader telling you there are none.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|This program is fantastic makes it so easy to navigate and find what I am looking for easily. Very nice interface.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game is really fun to play because you try harder and play more to unlock more games. the more you play the more the games cost to unlock them.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love the Big Bang Theory. Got totally hooked in the later part of the series, so I had to go back and buy the first season to see how the Big Bang Theory started. I wasn't disappointed! Great series, Great Actors. Love it!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|Wakes me up when I need it to. Good app. I recommend! Has many options for how you want to wake up and is fool proof.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|As another reviewer stated, the first two chapters were rough to get through. I almost gave up. After trudging my way through into chapter 3, it started to pick up for me. By chapter 4 I was hooked, and finished the book within 2 days. The author gives a lot of background in those first few chapters, very similar to a James Michener book. (James Michener would spend several chapters writing about the geography of the setting of a story, before actually getting to the story). So this is a story of an incredible journey of a young man, from being shipwrecked with a ferocious tiger to landing on an island of carnivorous plants. Nicely written. I don't read fiction often, but this was a good one.
B0058VW36U|1.0|The game is fun and very well done. Most of the levels are locked so I can't use them. I don't like that.
B004QX07G4|3.0|Ellen is extremely funny and talented in person. As a writer it just doesn't cross over. Some chapters hit the mark and other's did not.
B009JNXK88|4.0|Love the retro art, easy goal (get to the end and kill the scientist) and the brutally hard gameplay. It's Super Meat Boy with an action edge. It has an Angry Birds like star system that adds tons of replay along with hidden briefcases to have you coming back for more. My only gripe is I don't like the button spacing on the Kindle. Not a problem with the game sd much as it is with touch screen games in general. A must download for retro action fans on the go.
B0094OLJD0|4.0|I wasn't a fan of either one of these artists, but just happened to listen on NPR and really started enjoying it.  The songs are more one artist or the other as far as vocals, but still a great collaboration album.
1451620829|4.0|I've read Gene's and Ace's books.  Each is primarily the author's life story, but the only reason anyone cares about either one of them is KISS.  Hardcore fans of the band were generally disappointed that more dirt wasn't disclosed.  Well, Peter Criss' long-awaited memoir doesn't disappoint.<br /><br />I've read a dozen rock biographies this year, and Peter's is really high on the list when it comes to placing the reader into the scenes of the band's history.  One can almost smell the incense and greasy hair of the early 70s.  He (and his co-writer) craft vivid scenes about of how KISS formed and the chaos that went on backstage.  And no one is spared. Not even women with him he had the briefest flings or road managers he met once.  He uses passages from Gene's book against him perfectly, such as refuting Simmons' claim that he thought Bob Ezrin's cocaine pile was Sweet-N-Low.  The story of Gene's full-body herpes outbreak is worth the price of the book alone.  Of most interest to KISS fans is probably his revelations (and assassinations) of Paul Stanley's character.  Gene only had positive things to say about Paul in \\"KISS and Make-Up.\\"  Ace barely mentions Paul at all in \\"No Regrets.\\"  But Peter rips Paul a new one, and the stories will leave KISS fans nodding in epiphany and stating \\"OH!  Iiiiiiii see.\\"<br /><br />However, as the bio winds down, Peter seems to show barely any attitude of gratitude.  Yes, he was taken advantage of.  Yes, he was probably ripped off.  Yes, he was betrayed.  But, the downward spiral into negativity makes one feel less and less sympathy to Peter.  It's palpable that anyone could feel less guilty about betraying and stealing from Peter Criss after reading this book.  He is honest with himself and the reader, but not nearly harsh enough on himself.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it is so addicting! You should really get it its fun for all ages! I love it love it love it
B000002AGN|5.0|I've enjoyed this album since it's first release. Few reviewers seem to be aware that the exotic time signatures are, in fact, those of Balkan dance music. In other words, dances of the former Yugoslavia (Serbia, Croatia, etc.) and also Macedonia. As a former Balkan dancer in Berkeley California, these rhythms are very familiar to me, and Brubeck either lived, or spent a great deal of time in, Berkeley around the time these recordings were made, and I have no doubt at all that he heard some of this dance music.<br />\\"Take Five\\" for example, though often counted as a sort of syncopated five beats, is actually derived from a Balkan dance tune in 11/16:<br />one-two, three-four, FIVE-six-seven, eight-nine-ten-eleven. Hard to explain in words, try patting your knees like this: LEFT right LEFT right LEFT right right, LEFT right LEFT right, and you can come fairly close. In the Balkans a large double-sided drum called a \\"tupan\\" is used, one side beat with a large stick, the other with a fairly light twig. In my description, the words in caps are the big stick, the others are lighter taps from the twig. Balkan purists will scoff at my attempt, but this is the best description I can come up with. Other time signatures on the album are 9/16, 7/16, etc.<br />It's a great album, a classic, and I've just ordered a copy to replace my old vinyl edition.
B009ZQAN9I|5.0|I thought I would have trouble embracing the same actors in a new story, but I love season two so far. It's so different from season one that it makes it easier for me to think of them in different ways. So far, season two seems to have a lot more &#34;crazy,&#34; but what else can you expect from something called &#34;Asylum&#34;? That's all I'll say, because anything else would require a spoiler.
B0054SMID0|3.0|I enjoyed this movie. However I was very disappointed that I could not watch this movie on my ipad while flying from Seattle to Atlanta without purchase of Delta gogoflight internet services.  I assumed when you purchase amazon movies it would be downloaded to youe ipad so you could watch the movie anytime. NOT SO!  So, why would I purchase another movie from Amazon knowing internet services is required to watch movies?
0316228532|3.0|While the ending of the book was poignant, and I respect the point Rowling was trying to make, it was too difficult getting there. \\"Casual Vacancy\\" is jam-packed with characters, virtually none of them admirable, so there is no one to empathize with. The bare bones plot details the power struggle that ensues after a member of the parish council dies. As the characters plot and scheme for his now-vacant seat, their children are neglected and sordid secrets come to light. \\"Casual Vacancy\\"'s potential might have been realized had the book been better edited. A few sympathetic characters among the many, or fewer characters overall may have allowed the plot to gain momentum. As it is, Rowley imprisoned us in the petty, social-striving world of Harry Potter's muggle family, the Dursleys, with no magic.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put it down - great novel that will surprise you.  I am very impressed with Gillian Flynn and plan on reading more from this author.
034580404X|5.0|I have been too busy to read lately, but with all the hype about this book, I had to check it out!  I got the whole trilogy as I knew I would want to read the entire series.  Well, I got them on a Friday, and couldn't put the books down!  I read the entire series by Sunday night!  They are great books! I love the storyline.  I do feel you need to be open minded when one reads these books.  But, I also feel that if you don't like it.. don't read it.  They are definately a Re-Read!
B005FUJNNU|5.0|We loved this movie & the 3D was amazing. It might be a little scary for very young children, but they see much scarier & vulgar programming on prime time TV.
0525478817|5.0|Best Book I've read this year.  The characters memorable.  The dialogue true. A small book with a big heart, and a bigger philosophy.
B0083SBJXS|5.0|This movie is one of the greatest of all time. Good story and great action. And of course humor. All the ingredients needed to cook up a magnificent film.
B009KHDT0C|5.0|I love Tim Burton, and this was no let down.  John Depp is amazing at comedy as well as drama.  And the two of them hardly ever go wrong.  This movie is much more whimsical than most Tim Burton flicks, but I loved it just the same.  No hidden meanings, so dark mystery... just plain old creepy fun.  Good Halloween favorite for the family.  Two thumbs up. :-)
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|great time playing.  great hours of fun fun fun.  a lot of fun times.  Great time playing.  Well worth the money.
B000ICXQOM|4.0|This film was okay.  I'm not a huge fan of comedy, but this even made me laugh.  There are a couple things that would have been nice if they had been explained, but the dialogue was funny, the acting was decent.  It was worth a watch.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Reflected in You was an amazing book. So may twists and turns. I couldn't put it down. So far this was my favorite out of the the Crossfire Novels. I can't wait for the last one. A definite must read!!!
B001RTCP1A|3.0|Pitch Black is a sci-fi horror flick in a similar vein as the Alien movies ([[ASIN:B004RE29T0 Alien [Blu-ray]]], [[ASIN:B004RE29PO Aliens [Blu-ray]]]), although not quite as good.  It begins with a group of space travelers who awaken from cryo-sleep to find that their ship has been damaged and is on a collision course with a desert-like planet.  After a white-knuckle crash landing, the survivors try to find their way back home, while avoiding the dangerous escaped prisoner Riddick (Vin Diesel, who oozes cool).  Along the way, they discover that they are not the only creatures on this planet.  And with night coming, their chances of survival plummet.<br /><br />Director David Twohy keeps the tension up throughout and gets good performances from the actors, which is not always the case in these types of films.  Radha Mitchell is both strong and sympathetic as the defacto leader of the group.  Cole Hauser, who plays the mercenary Johns, is a capable foe for the Riddick character.<br /><br />The movie has a slick look, with an appealing use of color tinting.  The special effects look a bit dated now, particularly the animation of the creatures, but they are still good enough for some scares.  The blu-ray transfer is well done--both audio and visual are strong.  The daytime scenes are crisp and detailed.  The nighttime scenes are a little grainy, but still very good.<br /><br />This edition contains both the theatrical version of the movie and the unrated director's cut, which is a bit more gruesome.  It contains several featurettes and other special features not included in the DVD edition.<br /><br />Not everyone will like this movie.  It contains violence and a number of frightening scenes.  There is also some language.  Nevertheless, a redemptive theme emerges in the closing minutes of the movie that makes the viewing experience worthwhile.  Without it, this movie would have been grim and pointless.
B009NB6Y48|5.0|The Good wife always delivers on a great plot with wonderful actors.  I have never been disapointed.  Much better than the proliferation of reality tv being handed to us today
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Having thoroughly enjoyed The Litigators, I was highly hopeful of a similarly enjoyable read for The Racketeer. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with The Racketeer, primarily because I felt it was a very one-dimensional story - it was so easy to follow, with none of the expected twists and turns, that I finished the book with a clear sense of having been let down. I read the second half of the book thinking \\"this can't be it, there MUST be a twist coming somewhere\\", but alas, when it came it had been so clearly signalled form the start that I didn't even acknowledge it.<br /><br />I will still buy Grisham's books because of the many that I have read, the vast majority have entertained me and kept me in suspense, but in future I will pay more attention to the independent reviews before I click the \\"Buy\\" button!
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|This was my second book by this author. Definitely a waster of money. Extremely superficial characters and plot structure. I found it boring. Did not finish it because it was too boring.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|Great companion to the game to know what happened in space instead of just the ground forces.  The backstory with the Chief was worth it all by itself!
B009LUAR0I|5.0|I continue to be impressed with Mika--everything about this album is a win. Compared to his previous albums this one is definitely familiar but still has a great sense of energy and creativity that builds on his best work. And for any francophiles out there, \\"Elle me dit\\" has a great official video with Fanny Ardant that is worth your time to seek out.
B00866JLEG|4.0|This is one of the best love stories in quite a while.  The plot of the soldier being saved by the shinning light and then searching for the girl in the picture was moving...again great story and awesome cinematography.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|In the spirit of Candide or Around the World in 80 Days, this book is truly delightful.  At once humorous, intriguing and suspenseful it is an alternate history tour of the last century from the viewpoint of one who is totally a-political.  Don't fret: \\"It is what it is\\".
B001A3EM8M|4.0|They were four of the best musicians that came together to produce three excellent albums. To bad Roy Orborson died and the group was no more.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|Jo Nesbo is a good storyteller as well as a good writer.  The Snowman was translated from the Norwegian and is full of twists and turns.
B008WCP2PG|1.0|Seriously? 5 stars? We are not rating a dance scene here but a whole movie...and that whole movie SUCKS. The lead female has to be the worst actor I've ever seen. This movie is just beyond bad. And I'm not hard to please as far as movies go. But, no one will listen. So, go watch it...and then kindly review it. Everyone in this movie needs an acting lesson. McConaughey, too. Things must be TOUGH for him to accepted this role. As for Tatum - the guy can dance...but this is one movie to not be proud of. Of course, it's all about the money, and he made it. So, I guess the last laugh's on him. SAD what the public accepts these days. Even sadder what the industry is passing off as a motion picture.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I enjoyed \\"Defending Jacob.\\"  I couldn't put the book down.  I would recommend it for anyone who usually guesses the outcome.  You won't be able to do that with this book.[[ASIN:0385344228 Defending Jacob: A Novel]]
B009A3NGF4|5.0|Big fan of Mumford and Sons. Been waiting for this CD to come out. Added bonus to find The Boxer on here. Scored huge points!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I sailed through this book. All the action and events remain true to the premise. There no last minute miracles. Just well developed characters, great and vivid descriptions and a compelling plot line.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|I not received this book. It us about 1of 3 books l ordered in the  last  t not receive the book. h  that have not yet  to me. Where are they???i?  I am  now receive the book.  which is laid out he nuts and bolts o which is laid out the nuts and bolts of writing. I  truly  considered by every writer.  lays out i lays out is personal life and it is writing life. what he considers t what he considers to be writing at all. Hooray hooray hooray
B009NPM5Y2|2.0|I loved all the stars in it and the humor, but I never really was super excited about it while watching.
B008KWHM6U|4.0|I really enjoy their music. This is a good CD especially while driving. Relaxing music, that's not too loud and not too mellow. Just like their previous CD, most of the songs are good. That's if you like their kind of music. I would recomend to Pre-View their songs through Amazon or somewhere else before buying it.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is one of the cool games, especially when you get bored and have nothing to do, all you have to do is play the game 1 time and you'll be addicted to it
B0045HCJRG|5.0|good movie, lots of fun. Love Brendan Fraser & Alicia Silverstone.Christopher Walken & Cissy Spacek are great, too. Love the way they react to the way the world has changed.The guy that lives in the soda shop is so funny!
B009YDB2QK|2.0|I have to say episode 3 was the first ep to disappoint me in this series, and I actually felt irritated at the end of this episode. I found the story line to be very choppy and forced, and far too predictable, especially with Andrea and Michonne. Andrea's character has stagnated instead of continuing to develop into an interesting person to watch, and Michonne is a clone of the archetypical comic book dark hero, complete with angry scowl and flat personality, who can't even recite her very few poorly written lines without sounding forced and stilted. Get rid of that character, she doesn't actually do anything for the story line. I'm hoping this was a fluke, and the rest of the season gets better.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|Great for kids and people of all ages. Actors are great.Great story line. Can watch this one again and again.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Once I started reading the sample it was hard to stop......<br />This book will keep you from boredom![[ASIN:B0071XO8RA Wool Omnibus Edition (Wool 1 - 5)]]
B005JFFYPW|5.0|This is a very good movie. Lots of action,great story and caracters.Funny and serious parts.Ryan is awesome.Great effects through out.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|This app is awesome! I already bought some characters but I was at the store to buy. characters and my kindle froze! It didn't work for a whole day until my dad figured out if you press the power button for 30 seconds it will reboot your kindle. Beware of locking down on yours too!!!
B009NPKTN6|1.0|Gave it one star because I like the music. Wait for it to come out free on cable. Not worth the money to rent.
B000FA5SMK|2.0|Plum Island started out well.  A convalescent policeman becomes involved in an odd murder investigation.  He becomes interested in an intelligent policewoman.  Then he starts to get macho.  The ending is beyond belief.  Although Mr. Macho claims to know little about boats, he takes a speedboat out into the turbulent waters between the Long Island Sound and the Atlantic Ocean during a hurricane.  And he has a couple of beers while doing so.  The supposedly sensible policewoman goes along and is mightily impressed.  Ugh.  Then it gets sillier.  I was, in the end, quite disappointed.
B008OOYALE|5.0|just started playing like it so far. takes a while to earn credits but not to much pressure to buy credit yet. good graphics. dragons are cute. I will newel playing for now and see how it goes. will update after I have more play time.
B004WY2K12|5.0|Awesome and delicious.. my son just turned 16.. his request was for me to make tres leches cake..i found tres leches cup cakes..amazing!!!
B009MCRHH6|1.0|I would have bought it if it was only $2.50...played trial on comp...loved it...but trial only went up to world 3...
143353083X|5.0|I'm happy with my purchase! It is a nice size and it is very helpful for my college studies by helping me to understand the Bible better.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|A lot of fun but ads frequently get in the way of gameplay and send you shooting off to the App Store.
B000002L9S|5.0|In Madonna and Like a Virgin, Madonna's vocals were slightly high-pitched (almost sounding like a little kid), but with True Blue, her voice has more of a mature sounding to it on a majority of the tracks and her vocals are stronger on this album than they were on any of her previous efforts. This album is jam packed with catchy songs that are sure to please her fans. From soft ballads to dance grooves, Madonna makes her mark with this album and proves that she is here to stay for a long time and isn't going anywhere anytime soon. My favorite songs on the album would have to be \\"Papa Don't Preach\\", \\"True Blue\\", \\"Open Your Heart\\", \\"La Isla Bonita\\" and \\"Where's the Party\\".
B006XBSAP2|4.0|The CD itself is great, but two of the songs skipped as soon as I put it in the CD player.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book is an amazing story of love, family, and faith in God. It was an easy and quick read.
B0086700CM|5.0|really cool and exciting ! lots of twist and turns all very exciting! you must try it for yourself it's free:)
B0083P1QUM|5.0|I love Ptricia Cornwell books.  They keep your interest all the thru the book. This story line kept your interest all the way thru and kept you guessing how the ending of the book would end.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|It does everything I need and the battery color can be changed. I like that it tells you how long you have for video, music, reading and other things. It even tells you the state of the battery right down to the type.
B009JNXK88|5.0|This is a good time wasting game. The levels are short and numerous, allowing me to play a little bit at a time. The controls are well executed, and the platforming is fun.
1451662432|5.0|This is not simply an autobiography of one successful person.  It is a book of motivation that helps you to reflect on yourself and help you achieve what you like.  Truly amazing story of one immigrant, who came with nothing and ended up having it all!<br />You can read it page by page fully, or just pick a random chapter and start from there. It is written in a way that you don't have to read first chapter in order to understand the next one. Language is very easy to read, so you fully concentrate on the content rather than on grammar.<br />Worth every penny!!<br /><br />Enjoy!
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|I love the Richard Castle series of Nikki Heat books. I have read all but the last one (Frozen Heat) in the series and plan to start it soon. The characters are interesting and I can relate them to the characters on the \\"Castle\\" TV show. Jamison Rook, the writer character in this book, has the same sense of humor as Richard Castle on TV. It helps to read the books in the order they were written to keep some of the characters straight but it isn't absolutely necessary to enjoy the book. I hope there is another one coming out soon in this series. One of my favorite authors!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This book is one of those books that Mr. DeMille composes that make you want to leap forward in time to read the next one.  A very good read 10 of 10 stars
B0086700CM|4.0|I like this game a lot. I purchased the game for my<br />grandson who is a computer wiz.  He loved the game and I<br />would recommend it for anyone who love to play computer<br />games. I gave the game 4 stars but he said I should have<br />rated it 5 stars. Try it out and see don't you like it.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|it is great for kids. I think it fun and so dose my 8 year old daughter. we love to play and win the prizes so we can sell them.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Nice app. Easy to work and customize the colors you want to personalize this app just for you. It works on my phone and my Kindle with no problem so far. I've had the app for almost 2 months with no complaints yet.
B007VUA7VO|4.0|its a great battery app but it would be nice if it didn't open the app every time you plug your kindle fire in.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it is like temple run but on a train:p oh Ps fore all the hatres that hate this game why did you get it in the first place? Well gtg don't want to waste time.Bye $)!
B009NQKPUW|3.0|It started out great, but really went down hill within the first 45 minutes. It got cheesy, had poor dialogue and felt hastily finished.<br /><br />I'm glad I rented it instead of purchasing it to view it. If you're on the fence as I was, go for it, it's certainly entertaining, just not in the way you would expect.
B009HUB40Y|5.0|This is an exciting game for my 6 year old gran-daughte and me  . We love the sounds and affects it has. We do compete against each other and have the best fun with the best jewel game.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|This is a great plot but Baldacci tends to elongate each step of the process. It seemed to take forever to get to the conclusion. Nevertheless it is typical of the type of terrorist activity that is on-going throughout the middle east and elsewhere. And it emphasises the many unsung heroes who regularly risk their lives to keep our country safe.
B009JNXK88|5.0|Fantastic game if you need to pass the time. I got it for free from Amazon's free app of the day program, but it's worth the $0.99!
0316228532|5.0|The Casual Vacancy was every bit (& even better!) than I expected. The character development & story had me thinking about them long after finishing the book. It was difficult to put it down as the story was so compelling. It was truly a tale of the \\"haves and the have nots\\". J.K. Rowling does not disappoint.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Having the bible in multiple versions in the palm of your hand. Quick to find verses,highlight and bookmark and then change translations in an instant. Another cool feature - it will read to you not in a computer generated voice but narrated by a real person.
B0018J2QB8|4.0|Wish I would've caught this show on it's initial run but I didn't want to pay extra for Showtime. I should also add, a show about a serial killer was hard to grasp for me due to my convictions. Well after putting my bias aside I find myself rooting for Dexter to rid society of heinous people. The writing and characters are well done with a great supporting cast. I enjoy the sub plots almost as much as watching Dexter at work. If you can get past the serial killer element of Dexter, you will be truly rewarded with a top notch series.
0525953728|5.0|Easy read for someone with no military background.  I have really enjoyed the book!!!!<br />I worried book maybe too technical but it was not.  I also do not feel it compromised government secrets
B008XG1X18|5.0|I am spending way too much time using this app! I love the DIY, decorating &amp; recipes available to me.
B004ZRV3AU|2.0|The product is easy to set up however, I have scored many bottles and none of them have split evenly along the score line.  The split runs along the score line for a bit then runs up or down the bottle away from the score line. Will continue to practice but I hate wasting nice bottles!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I have been less that satisfied with the last two books by Patricia Cornwell featuring Kay Scarpetta.  All of the characters seem unhappy and at odds with each other.  Not saying that it should be all sunshine and roses, but I am starting to no longer like characters I have loved since her first book about Kay.  I did read the entire Bone Bed, but can't say that I particularly liked it.
0812993292|5.0|This novel is deceptively simple.  It tantalizes the reader with its gentle pacing like that of the old man on a mission across Great Britain.  It reminds me of \\"Straight Story\\", a true tale about another old man traveling on his riding mower across Iowa to reconnect with his dying brother.  Mr. Straight's mission touches everyone he meets, as does Harold Fry in this novel.  Fry's journey is a deeper, darker pilgrimage to find the place to begin again with new love and understanding.  It is one that is best told through the fingertips of a fine writer and Rachel Joyce is one fine writer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is way better than temple run!! way more action and challenges! my eight year old brother loves ir its great for kids!
0613824229|5.0|Of course Ender's Game is the ultimate preteen sci-fi novel and has been reviewed many many times before.  Great book.  My review is primarily about the physical book itself.  I ordered the library binding copy because I couldn't find a harcover copy and library binding was the second best.  For those who don't know, library binding means that a normally softbound book is bound with a hardcover; this means that the pages are paperback high-acid cheapo quality, unlike a true hard cover book, which usually has higher quality pages.  That having been said, the cover and binding are both high quality and look like they will last a long time.
B004SVM7BW|5.0|I needed something that could highlight and annotate a PDF, and RepliGo gave me just what I needed in an inexpensive app.  Bravo!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I would have given 4 stars for cast, production, sets, etc., but the script was rather lame and the ending wrapped up nothing...just left me wondering where the end of the movie was.
B006VGGAC4|4.0|Not just an American dream story, but a story of an extraordinary, but real life. Nicely written, very authentic and amusing, despite too many details on movie business. Also a very positive reading that provides you with energy. The only disappointing part is the last one, about his recent family troubles. Not sure how sincere this part is and compared to the rest of the book, you learn nothing valuable from these pages. Interesting details about cultural differences between America and Europe and many wise political \\"bipartisan\\" considerations. The book helped me to survive several long flights in the economy class, it cut the length of any of them by half![[ASIN:1451662432 Total Recall: My Unbelievably True Life Story]]
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|Love, love, LOVE this soundtrack! I've listened to it over and over. I only wish it also contained some of Becca's dj mixes as well as the A Capella tracks. Oh well. :/
B008JH5CVS|4.0|I can sum this movie up in two words, but the review requires me to use at least twenty.My two words mindless entertainment.  That is not a bad thing.
B007JM4CWY|4.0|I have both the black and white and color versions of this game, I would give this one a 5 stars if I didn't have the color version to compare this to.<br />Its either me or some of B & W are not solvable.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|This story was different than many of the books that I have read because it helped you feel what each character was experiencing before, and during the walk. It contained several surprises and often made me sad. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys Stephen King Books.
B008D28HYS|5.0|I didn't really care for the game at first, but came to love it after I figured out all the rules and tricks. It might seems alot for the cost, but for less than a movie ticket, I got hours of entertainment from it.<br />************************************************<br />Still love it after 3 months, just wish they would offer it for I-pad.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|It's on the description. This app just unlocks the hidden camera app on the device.<br />You can do the same thing using a free app called ES File Explorer. Search for it on Amazon AppStore, install it and search for instructions on YouTube.<br />There's no need to pay $1.99 for something you've already paid for and you can access it for free. Just my 2 cents.<br /><br />PS. If you happen to find a bug in this app, don't try contacting the developer. I'm not so sure he can do something about it...
B007FEFLTO|2.0|Great story but the kindle version is missing a bunch of pages. This should not happen for such an expensive book.  Almost every chaper had missing pages and started in the middle of a chapter.  Did this happen to anyone else?
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love this app.  I can tweak it with just the right amount of thunder, wind and rain noise which is what I like to drown out my husband's snoring and my off-kilter ceiling fan.  But I have also used it at work with headphones to provide me with a melodic background/white noise combo to allow me to block out distractions and focus on an important task.  Of all the apps on my Kindle Fire, I think this is the one that I don't want to live without.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|Ok. So, the good: Great acting and great cinematography. The bad: There are just too many random things that happen that come out of nowhere or don't follow logically from the action or are unexplained. Here are a few things that come to mind (and there are many). The main female character gets an emergency c-section, which was suspenseful and interesting. That's fine. But, she suddenly stumbles into a room where she sees their, supposedly dead, benefactor awake from his sleep. The emotion of the scene unnaturally shifts from the female lead's ordeal to the old man's awakening. Her very recently psychologically traumatic and physically shocking ordeal is suddenly an afterthought (and remains so for the rest of the movie). This is unsettling to the viewer because the plot line is not allowed to be carried through, or at least comes to a satisfying end. The female lead should be the one lying down receiving medical attention, not the old guy. The awakening of the old guy isn't even necessary to further the plot. Speaking of unnecessary characters, Theron's character is a total waste of space. She doesn't add anything to the movie besides her isolated chamber that comes into play at the end. Her presence also complicates the captain's raison d'etre. Isn't he the captain? They could have made him the evil corporate watch dog and saved some time and money. It's almost like Theron's character is included for star-power to sell tickets. Not only does her character not further the plot, she's annoying. Either make the captain the captain or eliminate the captain and make her the captain. There are too many characters in this movie with no clear purpose. Lastly, (and by that I don't mean the last problem) the male love-interest comforts the lead female character in one scene where he reassures her and it illustrates his zest of life, but in next scene, he is very quick to commit suicide by offering himself up to Theron. His actions do not follow what was established for hischaracter. And, it is complicated by Theron's insistence that the door be shut and he dies (another reason why her character was a poor choice). It would have been better to have the male and female love interest have a tender moment outside of the ship when he realizes that he cannot compromise the security of the ship. Better yet, there could be an isolation area for just that purpose where he gets quarantined and he could eventually morph into something that the female lead has to reluctantly kill later. That would have added more meaningful, ironic tension to the plot, making us sympathize with the the female lead's choice to kill what used to be her lover. Oh, and another thing. The holograms and dead bodies are never fully explained and I don't see how they fit into the alien-development-ingestation-development-continuum. When we first see something ominous, they are the size of meal worms. Then, they grow to python-size. How did that come about? It would have been great for a scientist on the team to collect a small sample and then explain why the increase in development so that we understand its morphing capability later. Anyway, this ends the rant.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I like it a lot. My beloved iPhone is protected, and it looks cool too. It installs easily and stays put.
0679805273|5.0|If you haven't read it do!!  grab it at the library, find a cozy chair and enjoy.  The message is so important, shows the ups and downs of life, in a wonderful way.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|Classic book will read in one sitting, fall in love with then read all over again, to fall in love all over again.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this is a great game and I recommend it to anyone. the dragons are really neat and it doesn't take forever to create your own dragon park.
B005IGZUTC|5.0|Yes!  What is not to love about every one of these books?  So so funny and entertaining, love this author!
159448385X|5.0|A Thousand Splendid Suns is a very well written depiction of women's role in the society of Islam.  The horrific injustices are outlined very clearly.  In all, the book is a tribute to the human spirit.
B00843TZJM|5.0|It was great to go back in time and see the classics performed live again. I am a veteran fan of this band having seen them live how many tmes I can't even remember but this concert does not disappoint. It is worth getting and adding to your library. From the beginning to the end it is chock full of great memories and sweet guitar licks. Thank you Stephen Stills for all you brought to this band and concert in spite of your challenging health issues. If you are a fan of this band and are questioning buying this DVD I tell you one thing: you have GOT TO just for THE SUITE! It is a masterpiece done to perfection.
B005HSL626|1.0|what is with all ads? on't want my kids playing with all the ads in the game.  It is very frustrating.
B005HWAOCA|5.0|What can you say about a reunion concert from arguebly the BEST lead guitarist, the BEST base player and the BEST drummer ever assembled in a rock/blues band but WOW. It was fresh, crisp and just plain awesome. If you're a Cream fan and don't have this DVD...your crazy! When I watch and listen to this band as I did back in the late 60's I always listened first to the song as a complete work then I'd break it down each time as I listened to the musicians doing their different components that made up the song. This live DVD gives you the ability to CLEARLY do that and so much more. THIS IS A MUST FOR THE AVID COLLECTOR.
1400063515|1.0|The book is full of superficial, narrow minded, anecdotal noise.<br />It takes a great idea, mixes it with people's fears, and trashes the best science we have. My over all feeling was one of disingenuous.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|this is a fun game! you gotta strategize on how to keep all the bonus coins from falling off the sides, but once you get the hang of it, its quite an addicting game!!
B000SEGUDE|4.0|This is one of those books where it would have been easier to understand if I had seen the movie first. I found it difficult to make the connections between characters during their different lives. The only connection that threads the lives of the chracters together is a reference to a birthmark. I will have to read this again after I see the movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book because it had so much detail and I could actually see everything in my mind that was going on in the book!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I played the orginals way back.  I want to give this 5 stars for old time sake. The only way this game is like the orginal game is maybe the music and fishing.  But then again I really did enjoy this game.  It's a building, farming, hunting, lets just say homesteading game.  The one thing that really irks me though is the use of CASH in the game.  Its not just for energy its for building buildings also.  Thus if you don't have cash or want to use cash the game will move along very slowly.  There are ways of acquiring energy through out the game although it is not often and not very much.<br />It also appears the game either utilizes social media or cash to be able to really play well.  For example to complete a storage shed one needs cash or help from friends to finish. So now I have an unfinished storage shed.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|This is a great follow up to book 1 and I thoroughly enjoyed the read.  the character development is just masterful and the story flows from family to family and location to location without any clumsiness whatsoever.  This is a somewhat chilling story for how real and helpless the characters were... stuck in a time when the world had gone mad!
B004AP9W46|5.0|This is one of my favorite novels by the Wonderful Anne Rice! It is so profound, and interesting.... I have read it atleast three times since it was first released.
B006HGXGWU|5.0|One of my favorite films of 2011 was TAKE SHELTER which was written and directed by Jeff Nichols who directed SHOTGUN STORIES which was one of the best movies of 2008. TAKE SHELTER is about a man named Curtis, played by Michael Shannon, who is a hard working husband and father in a small and close knit community in Arkansas. He starts having apocalyptic dreams of devastating storms and becomes obsessed with building a particularly elaborate storm shelter. His behavior soons alienates him from friends, co-workers and ultimately his family. As the audience we are given the choice to believe in his vision or go along with the rest of the community in branding him crazy and/or someone on the verge of a mental breakdown or possibly schizophrenic. The story, for myself, seems to be an allegory of how many people in today's society tend to easily dismiss individuals who have views that make them uncomfortable or uneasy. We tend to be lulled into beliefs that correspond to our most comfortable and least fearful theories and correspond to the beliefs coerced by mass manipulation. This can be quite detrimental to society as a whole when we rely so much on the judgements of groups instead of relying on our own truths. The great thing about this film is that it is one of those films that everyone will have a different take on. I believe that it is one of the director's primary intensions when making this film. It's a movie where if you see it with a group of people there will be great discussions afterwards. I also have to emphazise the incredible acting by everyone but particularly by Michael Shannon. The intensity he brings to his role is brilliant. I am now looking forward to director Jeff Nichols 2012 release called MUD.
B005PK553C|5.0|My husband and I were lucky enough to catch, by chance, the first show of this year's 2nd Season.  We watched.  We loved.  We're hooked!  We immediately went and bought Season 1 to catch up and end up watching 3-4 episodes in a row.  We only have a couple left.  Can't wait to start watching the new season but have to wait cause it's WAY too confusing to mix seasons!  Did I mention I LOVE this new series!!!!??
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|The episode, \\"Killer Within\\", made me cry.  How crazy is that?  A series about zombies and I end up sobbing. This season has really amped up the action.  Every week you never know what will happen next.  Anyone can live, anyone can die!  I am a little afraid that the sequences with THE GOVERNOR and his town could possibly slow the pace down but who knows? So far season 3 is on a par with season 1 with non stop surprises at every turn.  The idea to have the setting at a maximum security prison was perfect.  With all the dark corridors and never ending zombies popping up when you least expect it is brilliant. I hope these kind of thrills and chills keep up throughout the rest of the season.
1611761565|4.0|I found this book to be pretty interesting and informative.  Definitely would recommend for anyone who is a fan of military type books .
B008FPOIT6|4.0|Great story with something for computerphiles, conspiracy buffs, pop culture aficianados and anyone who enjoys a good read.  It's fast, well plotted and  has a beguiling first person narrator.  Great antidote to all the angst out there right now.
B009GEAPYW|1.0|I kept waiting for it to get better and could not believe that it was so well rated. My husband and I were both completely disappointed.
B0087JTAKW|3.0|Even though this book is on the NYT best sellers list, I found it dragging and boring.  The metaphor is so overused it lost it's punch.  Love, redemption, teenage tragedy and jaded wealth all jumble together.  There are better ways to spend your time.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I absolutely loved this app. I wish there were more apps like this one. I liked it so much that I would have bought this app if it would have cost money.
B009NPKTN6|4.0|At 18 in '87 the music was a trip down memory lane.  So was the hair and clothes LOL. Have fun!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|Another great book by Mitch Album. I really enjoyed reading this book.<br />Every high school student should have it on their reading list.
B004ZJZPXO|5.0|This is one of the best series I've seen in a long time.  I caught the last airing one night after work which turned out to be the pilot episode. (It seems like Fox wanted the show to fail.)  The writing is classic Whedon...the characters are memorable, they actually develop over the course of the show, there are some great lines and the set design is great.  On the down side the science is a little \\"iffy\\" in a lot of places, and the Mandarin is butchered most of the time.  Otherwise, if you like sci-fi mixed with a little western then this is the show for you!
B0087JTAKW|5.0|This book is full of thoughts we have all had! Once again, Mitch Albom has written a beautiful book! When you think it can't get better, it does!
B00594XOZU|5.0|I love this app.. I've got it on my phone as welland it is great to chat to those that you'd rather not have your phone number.<br />Only thing I don't like is that all your conversations get erased once you switch devices
1451695195|2.0|The major problem with this book is that it takes what is about 5 or less pages of interesting experience and continually repeats it while adding lots of filler.  The weather is often described, the fact that the experience defies science since the part of his brain that would support this experience was \\"off line\\" is repeated ad nauseum, and he even has a chapter on all the work that he put into recording his experience.  But where are the details of the experience?<br /><br />I can't speak to whether or not his experience is genuine, but it does not constitute proof.  Just because something happened that cannot be directly explained by our current knowledge of the brain (the most complex and adaptive computer, which humans did not design), does not make it \\"proof\\" that the supposed converse is true.<br /><br />Sounds pretty negative I know.  I bought this book very excited to read a blend of contemporary science and experiential proof of the afterlife;  I am a believer in both.  I really wanted to like this book, but found it boring and repetitive with very little real substance.  I also found some of the references to quantum physics a bit bizaare for an actual academic researcher.  Not that quantum physics is not real science (it is of course) or a subject that a physician/scientist wouldn't have a grasp on and so have the credentials to reference, but it's use in this book seems more along the lines of pseudo-science discussions where advanced science concepts are abused by people that have no real idea what they're talking about.  Just because Heisenberg Uncertainty takes a little fuzzy thinking to comprehend doesn't mean it's a mystical concept.
B009JNXK88|3.0|this game worked flawlessly on my kindle fire &amp; i had no issues with the controls. unfortunately this game could not hold my attention past the first two levels. i got bored &amp; deleted it. yeah 8-bit can cause nostalgia, but it also gets annoying to look at when you know there's so much betterness out there somewhere. i had hoped that this game would somehow be an homage to the &quot;evil league of evil&quot; of dr. horrible fame, which is the only reason i bothered downloading it in the first place. but no, it was just boring.
B005MMJ84K|4.0|Great book!  It keeps you engaged and yearning to turn the next page.  The author pulls you in to the character so you feel her struggles and victories and connect with her.  Can't wait to read the next book!
B006GECE9Y|5.0|This Browser is just great.  Easy to use and quick on loading.  Can't ask for a better one.  Beats the others that I have tried.
B009KHDT0C|4.0|It was pretty good! There was as you might imagine several adult themes and sexual innuendo. All of which I find hilarious!
B009NBSEXM|4.0|Cute show- a fairy tale soap opera.  Where do the writers come up with this stuff? No deep thought required here- no geosocial political agenda, no great morality tales. The greatest thing about the show is its original concept- and the Pacific Northwest backdrop.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is one of the best books I have read this year. I just could not put it down and that goes for the entire trilogy
B004J4WKTW|5.0|I love this book. The imagery is fantastic the story is original and well thought out and I want to live in this world. Join the circus today.
B003NTSBUG|5.0|Martin Scorsese at his very best.  Of course the cast had a lot to do with it's success.  Anyone looking for a ma-cob thriller should buy/rent this movie.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Kept you guessing to the end lots of twists.  As usual grisham has done it again.  Awaiting the next book
B003O86FMW|4.0|It was a little disappointing.  The plot could easily have been predicted from the first book.  Well written but not nearly as exciting as the first book.
0451232852|5.0|I do not usually read books of 920 pages but this one was great! I am not a fast reader but I flew through this book. The characters are well developed and the plot flows seamlessly.  From what I know of WWI it held true to history. I have the second book in the series ordered and expect it to arrive today. I will be reading tonight!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|John Corey is in the same league as Jack Reacher and Mitch Rapp. In classic Demille style the story is suspenseful with humor interwoven throughout. The book leaves off at a point where you know the next book by Demille will start. Can't wait.
B0019I6WDG|5.0|Diablo Cody won an Oscar for this wonderful screenplay.  Excellent ensemble cast.  Enjoyable and appropriate music.  I like movies that work, and \\"Juno\\" works.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. A human struggle, survival and inventive. I thought it moved a little slowly at first but it was still intriguing and it certainly picks up. A good read.
B009NQKXYK|2.0|Beautiful to look at and Michael Fassbender is an acting class unto himself.  But - without getting into any spoilers - why does this movie exist?  It seems designed to be the set up for the Alien series (disregarding the terrible AVP films) but in the end it violates its own directive by not completing the task and by asking more questions that it deliberately sets out not to answer.  I don't know if it happened in the editing room or not - but it completely negated the purpose of making this movie at all.
B000IYU9HW|5.0|This film was a reawakening of my youth.  One of the most powerful examples of love shared and lost.  Very emotional and moving.  Excellent in content.
B00122TDAS|5.0|I'm not really a huge Genesis fan, but this album is amazing.  I fell in love with this album in college back in the 80s and then lost it when the '94 Northridge earthquake destroyed all of my vinyl (water damage).  I don't know what made me think of this album again and buy it as an Amazon download, but it's still a classic.<br /><br />The tunes are good and the lyrics all tell stories in a very Lord of the Rings kind of way, with stories of underdogs in battle.<br /><br />There's one track that stands out as a \\"single\\" and seems somewhat misplaced as more of a pop tune, but it's probably the most well known track as one of Genesis's few \\"love songs\\".<br /><br />Most of the tracks are long enough that they seem to segue from one to the next, which makes a nice long uninterrupted mood, but if you pay attention you can still tell where Side 1 ends and Side 2 begins.<br /><br />This is a great album for cold nights when you don't want to turn on the TV.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Considered this movie due to the vast all star power actors ending was weak but still a worth while action and suspense movie would definitely recomend to view
B004SIP6BI|5.0|Movie is a delight and very enchanting..highly recommend it Johnny Depp is very good as is the rest of the cast..wonderful story..delivery was very fast..
B00571F26Y|5.0|Lost 8 lbs in three weeks and inch at my waist without a exercise program. Plus I feel better and sleep more sound.<br />  Karl
B00992CF6W|5.0|ok so all u people yelling talking about &quot;I hate it it always lose my progress&quot; well then check your kindle. for one thing if your kindle is very packed with no space then yea it might not save. also lags for me happen when the kindle has little to no battery life so, charge it maybe. but for real nothing is like minecraft. so if u say its not like Pc or x-box verison, well no its not because one it had to be mae to fit a smaller screan two its in its early stages so no it isnt very packed full of stuff. all in all stop hating.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|i love castle and its funny that i searched for nathan fillion on my kindle and found this. im tweeting him about this.
B0097EWK3A|4.0|this game was a lot of fun. great story and graphics. the running back and forth between locations became a little tedious but overall a very good and entertaining game. i loved it
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Perfect ! Arrived quickly to my sister in USA In time for her birthday!<br />Fast and efficient will use again !
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Could not put this book down until I knew if Jacob was really guilty. I think it's up to the reader to make their own decision. Most evidence pointed to guilty, but his Dad was so sure of his innocence that it kept flip flopping my decision. He was in total denial. Such a surprise ending!  I made a decision Jacob was guilty because no mother would intentionally do what she did. She was so distraught and knew deep down he was mean and capable. No one knows a child like their mother. After the shock of the ending, I really had to weigh everything and think about it before I came to my decision.  All in all, I really enjoyed the book and the fact that all is not really given to you, you have weigh all the facts and  decide for yourself.
B0071XO8RA|2.0|The first book was interesting a good read. didn't like the rest. It got boring and I hurried through the rest just so I could get to the end of it.
0062082353|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book.  The author did well in informing the reader where he came from and how he got to where he was in the SEALS.  Highly recommend this book.
B004V6BQ3O|2.0|I just bought one - foolish me - becuase Nikon *tend* to make good quality products. And the audio on my D4 was just horrible without it.<br />But using the ME-1 doesn't really help much. Terrible ammount of static noise from the background, even in a quiet office, with or without the Low filter.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend one of my friends buy one.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|In my sincere wish that more people will read this terrific book, it's tempting to reveal the intricacies of Cloud Atlas. Yet saying too much about it feels like betraying someone's dream. Thematically, Cloud Atlas is a solid tale about humanity, exploring both the peaks and valleys of our interrelationships. The plot follows several characters through the moments each of their lives is at its zenith. Each character has a distinct voice and style which I found compelling beyond their circumstances in the plot. The triumph of Cloud Atlas is David Mitchell's masterful deconstruction of literary convention. It is both linear and nonlinear in surprising (and to my mind, delightful) ways. It is a book that becomes an experience as you read it. I cannot overstate how much I enjoyed this work. A modern masterpiece.
B000SEIK2S|5.0|I really did feel I was reading another Robert Heinlein novel but that's not a bad thing at all. This was a great mix of story and ideas and technology and it's a book that I think will stick with me. I plan to read the rest of the series now. I would recommend Old Man's War to anyone that has enjoyed reading Heinlein novels and really anyone that enjoys science fiction in general.
B0087HT36U|5.0|loads of fun. play for hours. recommend that you get this.like angry birds but the hits are more direct.  glad I decided to get it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I am obsessed with this game! Very entertaining and enjoyable.. I play this game at least once a day, if not more..
B007IXWKUK|1.0|This is one of the worst books I have ever read. Just sex. It is interesting that this book has become such a best seller. A sex manual disguised as a novel. Says more about the reading habits of the public than anything else. And good literature remains unread.
B007QPFGJW|3.0|Toooo much gore in this one, but that seems to be the Nesbo standard. The ending, however enigmatic, is worth the read. We are left wondering . . . a good place to be.
B009JNXK88|4.0|its a fun game the only thing is that have a complicated controller. Sometimes doesnt work right. Still will continue playing it.
B003THJJ9Y|5.0|This is episode 2 and you will love it like I did!  Castle has all the charm and quirks to banter with Beckett. The writers are absolutely on the money with the episode. You will love it!
B009JNXK88|5.0|Excellent graphics, 100+ levels, retro-style graphics.  Each level may be completed normally, or extra challenges may be attempted, so things don't get boring quickly.  Controls work perfectly on my old two year old Nexus.
B0001HAHXW|3.0|I had expected this to be a stark, solo acoustic blues guitar album (probably due to the cover art) but it is not. The overproduced arrangements simply aren't inspired or particularly inspiring. Pity, because the 'Sessions for Robert Johnson (2004)' dvd has some very pure renditions of these and other Johnson tunes. I would have loved to hear a few of the very raw Eric + Doyle Bramhall II cuts from the dvd. I have yet to hear an R. Johnson song that benefits from fancy production.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|Loved it! Best movie I have seen in a long time. If your a sci-fi fan you will be in love with this movie.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|I love this album, she is so good at singing, an unique voice...:) i listen to it a lot and has a lot great song. i recommend it
B009KHDT0C|2.0|I would have gave it one star but there was a couple parts that made me lol.  Other then the couple funny parts it was a horrible movie and a waste of my time. Disappointed in Tim Burton.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|It is such an amazing. I haven't read all of it because i have school, but as soon as you open it, you won't close but if you do the next time that you will open it it's gonna blow your mind.....He is such an amazing writer, i recommend it, you won't be disappointed.
B008D19WBQ|5.0|It's a Wonderful idea to release Friends on Blu-ray ! Every fan around the world will be so happy (like me !). If you find the price is too high go on Amazon.fr because the same Blu-ray edition is available for only € 89.99 (approx $ 127.48). Plus English is available in HD 7.1 and the Blu-ray is not NTSC or PAL so you can watch it in America :)
1563523302|4.0|Chapter one is worth the purchase of the entire book.  Wish I'd had this 30 years ago.  Still, it is a great reference and helps with understanding financial options. I would give this 5 stars if the remaining chapters were as encouraging and motivating as the first.
B0000024LN|5.0|My nephew enjoyed this CD. He called to let me know that he received it and also thanked me a few times for it. He then called after he listened to the whole CD and thanked me again.
B008A1B5Z0|4.0|I still have a few issues with Kindle Fire, but having this Smart Ram Booster Pro on it has made the Fires use a little better. I've kept the 1st Fire this long because it was an anniversary gift from my wife, this passed June.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This is the perfect calculator for everyday use. Even better, it's free Haha :) I recommend this to everyone, a must-have on Kindle Fire.
B009JNXK88|5.0|this game is so cool I have never seen anything like it and its so adventurist the chances of you hating this game is 1 of
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I loved this book.  It was basically every nerd's dream come to life.  I ripped through this, devouring every page to  see what came next.
B0045TYDNC|5.0|Great Price, good product. I like this cap a lot. For the money its hard to beat and it provides the protection you need for your lens.
B0083GQ2A0|3.0|These men didn't deserve to live, I can't see any other outcome. Frankly, if this movie was accurate. They wouldn't have suffered as much.
034580404X|5.0|An excellent love story that's not nearly as S&M as I was led to believe. And no, I'm not a young person, and was not appalled at the context. I went into this knowing what to expect and not cowing away from the whole image, but no one bothered to mention what a beautiful love story they are as well. She is definitely a new author and needs some experience, but these are definitely a good start for her. Consise, edge of your chair suspense at times, and a growing love that climaxes beautifully. Most definitely a trilogy to remember. However, could have been concised into 1 or 2 books as you do tire of the lovemaking and skim over it after awhile.
B003WUYOQ6|5.0|My son first recommended this book to me, and then my doctor. I bought it, expecting it to be tough slugging, but it wasn't. I found it interesting and very well researched without being something only a scientist could follow. My feelings of guilt and failure all but vanished as I learned the reasons for my inability to lose weight the conventional ways. I drastically cut back the carbs in my diet and immediately started to see the scales and glucometer respond. The first few days were hard...it seemed the only positive thing each day was weighing myself. After a few days I started to feel lighter and less sluggish and, well, well! This book is interesting and educational for everyone. It could be life changing for many of us with metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes.
B000OVLINI|1.0|This was a lumbering book with several unbelievable plot lines.  It was overwritten, and had serious gothic overtones.  I would not recommend it and was barely able to finish it. I will not read another book by this author.  Sorry.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|not what i expected but was glad that it wasnt, written responsibly by a professional, worth reading, will be something i read again after a few years.  glad the book did not focus on osama bin ladin, but on the serving of our country.
B003KGBISY|5.0|An old favorite movie put on one disk, and made better quality. Love the format and think I'll be getting more Kurosawa films...
0812993292|5.0|This is a fantastic book. I just listened to the unabridged audible version and it was my favorite book of 2012. It is a wonderful, original story. Beautifully written .  A don't miss selection. I give it a 5!

B009NPKTN6|4.0|Great movie to sing along too with a group of friends-loved Russell Brand's character! Fun plot twists and Tom Cruise looks great.
B009329ZF2|1.0|What a terrible movie. Terrible acting! Terrible all around. I'd rather watch Open Water twice. I'd give it no stars if it would let me.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved how the story picks up and follows the children of the first book.  I was also glad everything is not rosy and people feel the effect of the war.  Well worth all of its pages!
B007EECSFA|5.0|As a fan of Kate Morton's writing, The Secret Keeper did not disappoint.  I liked it as much as Forgotten Garden.  The Secret Keeper was an excellent story with many twists and turns flashing between present day and WWII.  The ending is satisfying, putting all the pieces of the puzzle together.  I have already recommended this book to my family and friends and consider it one of my very favorite books of the year.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|Well written and action packed. On the downside, some of the historical picture he paints is dated, the plot is fairly predictable, and some of the content,specifically JC's flippant attitude, is getting so repetitious as to be distracting. Think 150 pages of plot interspersed with 450 pages of wisecracks that do nothing to move the story. I wonder if he hasn't taken the John Corey v super Islamic terrorist plot line about as far as it can logically go. Still, as with most of DeMille's novels, it's a good read.
B009FZZFME|5.0|Best show on,Tv dont miss out on a great tv show if u havent seen it start from season 1
0375842209|3.0|An interesting look at what it may have been like to be an average German (not Nazi party member) during World War II.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|loved it no game better good time waster if it was a boring game I would say it but it ant boring
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a great book with suspense as its ending. It is like an add on to the original series.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|good family fun better then other game with they made more or updated it or something but I love it family fun
B0050KTR36|5.0|I love this app! I was trying to study muscles for my class and was having a hard time. Speed Anatomy really helped me with bones, etc., so I bought Speed Muscles without hesitation. Totally helped, very detailed, excellent app.
B008MEM24S|5.0|I have to say wheres my water and wheres my perry is a very fun positive game to play. I have been telling my friends to buy it and i told them if thete is any extra thing to do on it to get it because there is really cool stuff.
B007L6VR6M|5.0|Probably the best movie I have ever seen.Don't miss it.The relaionship between<br />suzy an Sam is heart warming.The actors are top notch.Wes Anderson out did himself.I hope he makes more like this one.I have a friend who met his wife in the 3rd grade.They were 8 years old.Today they are grandparents.<br />this movie showes that love can bloom at any age.Wes Anderson is  genious  at movie making.Five stars.Inez
B005K17RU0|4.0|This app is very easy to use. I like it because it is very accurate. Day, night, afternoon--always accurate. I would recommend this app to anyone who likes to keep up with the weather in their area.
B004H8GLXQ|2.0|The author tries WAY too hard to make this novel suspenseful and intriguing.  Her prose is somewhat laughable, doesn't flow, and leaves a lot to be desired.  The final twist in the book is so ridiculous it's not even funny.  Big disappointment is all I can say.
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|I watched all the episodes of this show as they came on, but owning them has made going through the season just as hilarious as the first time through. Worth the purchase!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This was an excellent book.  It was well written and made the reader feel that they were there.I highly recommend this book.
B002P4VUMQ|5.0|I picked this up about a year and a half ago, and I probably will give it credit, along with Tonight Not Again, and Live and Acoustic, for pushing me into the \\"I love this man\\" phase of my obsession with this artist. At the beginning of the DVD, I remember thinking, wow, people really love this guy.  And by the end of watching, I could certainly see why.  For those wondering what the fuss is all about, this CD/DVD is a good way to find out.
0393064476|5.0|I loved this book.  First of all, I am not a scholar.  I am a romance writer.  So--light weight person here.  I am not sure one poem is as important as Greenblatt says Lucretius's poem is, but I don't care.  I loved reading about the middle ages, the corrupt Roman Catholic Church of that time and how it tried to silence any view that was against Genesis.  I loved reading about the ancient Greek and Roman literature that has been lost forever.  I loved reading about Poggio and his life and his times.  I am now reading Montaigne's Essays because of this book.<br />I have a particular horror of ignorant, prejudiced, unenlightened worlds such as that of the dark ages, that of the Taliban, or the Nazis etc.  And from time to time I enjoy reading about them because they offer examples of what our world would be like without tolerance.  Today tolerance in the U.S. is threatened--almost as much as it was then.<br />So--I loved this book.  I read it in a week.  It made me weep about twenty times because it touched me so deeply.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|It did not excite or inspire me to be looking for a sequel.....ok one time flick to watch once. Ok
B007MS5B6Q|5.0|This product is very well made and for me was well worth the money I paid for it. The alternate cover art is brilliant and the case itself feels solid and the disks stay in their holders unlike other bluray boxsets I own. I fully recommend this to any fan of the show as it is a worthy addition to any collection.
B0086700CM|5.0|This is A very fun game, that has kids and adults pay attention to the skills you need to exceed at the different levels of this game and also, win the whole entire game! I recommend this game to all ages from<br />5+
B009RI4ZKC|5.0|We found this movie to be smart and charming throughout.  Wes Anderson continues to deliver when I see one of his movies.  Characters are rich and quirky.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|This book was not as good as the first in the sense that it was so different. I love the turmoil in love stories, when its all hearts and flowers its boring. This book really kept you guessing and I loved every minute...cant wait for the last one!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is the best game ever .it's fun .I would get this game.this game is awesome fun cool educational fun for kids
B0098VYCCE|5.0|Although this is a somewhat darker version of Snow White than we are perhaps familiar with, Snow White & The Huntsman was very well done.  The cast were for the most part perfectly chosen for their individual roles, with Charlize Theron (Ravenna) leading the way.  Ms. Theron was the quintessential evil queen, brilliantly portraying her character as so thoroughly wicked, I felt the urge to run and hide.  She was so stunningly beautiful and hideously deranged that she stole the show and is the reason I gave the movie 5 stars.  Kristen Stewart did a commendable job at playing the part of Snow White, the victim.  I know that many fans of the \\"Twilight\\" series love to hate her, but she in no way should make or break the film for anyone wanting to see it.  She is neither an amazing actress nor a terrible one, but still her performance was solid.  She is very adept at expressing emotion with her face rather than through her lines (of which she had very few in many parts of the film). Her character just wasn't as important as either the evil queen or the huntsman.  Which brings us to Chris Hemsworth, who was another well-chosen cast member.  At the beginning of the movie, he played a very convincing drunken fool, a huntsman chosen only because he had survived the \\"dark forest\\" rather than any talent for bounty hunting. As the drama progressed, he slowly transformed into the hero of the show, but still retained a few warts (weaknesses) so as to be believable. The other hero, played by Sam Claflin, is also worth mentioning for his strong performance as William, the boyhood friend of Snow White.  Sam Spruell is another actor who deserves recognition for his intense portrayal of Finn, Ravenna's weak brother. Rounding out the cast are the men who portrayed the band of dwarves, each one brilliant in their own way, some subtle and some very much in your face, but all well done.  Of course, the other star of the film, the special effects team, was amazing. The film was a beautifulblend of reality and make-believe and is well worth losing touch with the real world for a couple of hours.
B000FC0ZAI|4.0|I bought this one by accident, thinking it was the Cloud Atlas the movie was based on.  It is not that book.  However, it is a fascinating read about a subject not many people know about: the war effort in Alaska during WWII.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|It wasn't horrible just way to similar to another well known adult book, even his initials are the same just in reverse.  But if your separate its not bad!
B008TMA1LY|2.0|I got the \\"free\\" version of this game for my 4 yr old. She loves it but there is only so much you can do with it before you have to \\"pay\\" more money to go on.  I don't think it is a good game because of this factor.
B0085A9J18|5.0|I'm not typically one who buys foreign made action movies, because their dubbing and story lines are often incoherent. However, this movie totally blew me away. There's a story and a ton of action that is filmed so ingeniously that it never gets boring. I hear a sequel is in the works. I'll definitely be in line to buy it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I was talked into purchasing this game for my 2 boys, ages 11 & 8. Their friends were all talking about this game, as it is aparently the game to play right now in our school district, so they had to have it too. They both love to play it and frequently wear out my Kindle battery! Great game and we haven't noticed any problems-works great on KindleFire and I feel the price is fair for as much as my kids enjoy this game. The only downside is that this version lacks some things that are available on the pc version, however, that doesn't bother my kids at all. This is their favorite game right now!
B00138KEH2|5.0|I downloaded Cochise,one song.But after listening to each song I decided to get the whole album. I would have missed out had I not listened to the other songs. I'm glad I did.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I gave this movie 5 stars mostly because although the CGI is incredible it doesn't out weigh the actors and story line.  Beautifully shot, excellent acting, and an outstanding start for another series of movies.  I especially enjoy how this is a new storyline but co-exists in the Alien franchise.<br /><br />There no reason to talk about this movie and spoil it for the viewer.  Just note, beautiful, excellent acting, a new wonderful chapter in the franchise.<br /><br />The special features are better than most and features a 3.5 hour doc of the movie.
B005S9ELM6|5.0|\\"Argo\\" is a thriller genre film based on the rescue mission of six United States embassy staff during the Iran hostage crisis.<br /><br />Whilst the narrative takes some creative liberties the viewer is nevertheless presented with a gripping story.<br /><br />The initial absurdity of using a Hollywood film location shoot in Iran, as cover, is the genius which makes this story so engaging, and this combines with repeated adrenalin rushes that at any moment the plan may become thwarted.<br /><br />A positive message toward seeking non-combative solutions for hostage extraction shines from this work.<br /><br />Ben Affleck provides a first class award winning lead and the style/costume design was masterfully authentic.<br /><br />Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author
B009MO5960|2.0|What's it about?<br /><br />With the help of a resistance movement, Alice must fight her way out of another evil underground Umbrella facility.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />Retribution starts where `Afterlife' left off; we see Alice on board the `Arcadia' tanker shooting her way through Umbrella bad guys in stylish reverse slow motion. As cool as this looks, it leaves a pretty clear indication that `Retribution' will continue the perilous downward spiral that began with `Afterlife'...zero story but bucket loads of slow-mo action. It seems Anderson has finally ran out of ideas...or maybe he just doesn't care. `Retribution' stars Milla Jovovich and absolutely nobody else worth remembering, as two more characters from the video game; Ada Wong (Li Bingbing) and Leon S. Kennedy (Johann Urb) are dropped into the series with absolutely no back story, and characters from past films in the series reappear only to serve as pointless bullet riddled clones. Remember when these films had characters with at least some diligence? `Retribution' may lack substance but it certainly makes up for it in style. The action is heavy and violent plus the 3D is insane, Anderson throws enough at the screen to keep you on the edge of your seat. Just like past films in the series, this movie really stimulates when the lovely Milla Jovovich dons the skin-tight black latex, sassy attitude and sub-machine gun; leaving men pleased and ushers displeased with cleaning up sticky aisles. `Retribution' may be action packed and heavy on the eye-candy but with each subsequent sequel I keep asking myself that question: \\"what happened to my beloved Resident Evil series?\\".<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />Alice as a suburban housewife is terrorised by a pack of hungry zombies.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />This was the first movie in the series not to feature undead dogs.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I recommend for anyone that likes &quot;match three games. No glitches on KF! I really enjoyed playing this game! You will not regret.
B005LAIHHC|4.0|What's it about?<br /><br />The heroic story of a dictator who risks his life to ensure that democracy would never come to the country he so lovingly oppressed.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />Sacha Baron Cohen, creator of films Borat and Bruno, returns to the big screen with a new character, Admiral General Aladeen. Although the creative team behind those films return (including Director Larry Charles) the film does not follow the same mock documentary style, instead relying on traditional fictional storytelling. But is it as funny? Almost. The writing is very good, having us almost feel sorry for Cohen the Dictator, as he loses his beard and all his power in a double cross. The relentless jokes are more hit than miss, with a number of laughs out loud moments, including a hilarious, albeit degrading cameo by Megan Fox. For the easily offended you might want to move along, for everyone else I found the film to be 'aladeen'...and I'm sure you will too!<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />The opening shows Aladeen in his native environment, winning awards, winning gold medals and executing staff.<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />Sacha Baron Cohen attended the 84th Annual Academy Awards in character and full costume as Aladeen, accompanied by his \\"virgin guards\\". He later spilled an urn with the `ashes' of recently deceased North Korean Dictator Kim Jong-il, on Ryan Seacrest's tuxedo.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|I really liked this game.It has great graphics &amp; a decent dialog. Its worth paying for. Much better than some hidden object games. Hopefully they come out with other good games.
B003Y5H5BA|4.0|What's it about?<br /><br />A pair of underachieving cops are sent back to a local high school to blend in and bring down a synthetic drug ring.<br /><br />Is it any good?<br /><br />`We're reviving a cancelled undercover project from the '80s and revamping it for modern times. The people behind this lack creativity and they've run out of ideas, so what they do now is just recycle shit from the past and hope that nobody will notice.' 21 Jump Street essentially begins with this hilarious quote from one of the characters, and is a perfect representation of what's to come, in that it doesn't take itself too seriously. Honestly, I had my doubts about the acting talents of Channing Tatum, based on previous films; but he was a fantastic pairing for Jonah Hill, who struts his comedy talents yet again. Action/ comedy films often find it difficult to balance, but this one is played to perfection. Watch it immediately!<br /><br />Best bit?<br /><br />The duo are forced to consume the drugs they are trying to bust, resulting in hilarity! `[expletive] you, science!'<br /><br />Did you know?<br /><br />Channing Tatum passed on the movie twice before he was convinced by Jonah Hill to take the role.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I enjoyed reading this book mostly because I used to teach children this age and I feel that Rowling really understands the way they speak and think. The adults do not come off as well - sometimes I could barely tell them apart. Still, I did finish reading the book because I wanted to find out what happened to the people.
B0042FZOFU|5.0|Like the blue ray set the kid watches it over and over. I would order more of this movies sets .
B009NPM5Y2|3.0|I should have liked this movie. I liked Mama Mia and I like watching Glee but for some reason this one fell flat for me. I think it's because I thought the plot was a little corny. I did however love the 80's music. It brought back tons of memories from my youth. It was everything in between that bored me. If you like musicals, it's worth a shot.
B0009MSHDQ|5.0|New product great shape.  I definitely will order again from this vendor on movies I want to see or add to my collection
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Really enjoyed this thought provoking and multifaceted glimpse into the life of Steve Jobs. Personally I find the story inspirational and at the same time brutally honest.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I chuckled throughout the book....love the cynicism and sarcasm.  Interesting ending I wouldn't have guessed.  Gave me a feel for what the war in Afghanistan must be like.  Very appropriate for our times, unfortunately.
B007QPFGJW|2.0|Harry Hole has returned from Hong Kong to solve a murder case involving his love's son.  This is a somewhat arduous book dealing with Harry's critical self analysis and minute details of live in the drug world of Oslo.  Harry always has one foot in the grave and one on unstable ground.  If you are into the seamy side of life this book is for you.  There is nothing uplifting here.
B001TODO54|3.0|There's something you should know about Graceling. It is about a killer girl. I mean, literally. The Main Character is born in a fantasy/medieval world where the some people are blessed, or cursed, with a talent called a \\"Grace.\\" These people have extraordinary abilities that are sometimes amazing and sometimes totally useless (like the ability to hold one's breath for a long time).    Katsa, whose uncle is the King of Randa, is one of those people and falls into the former category. She has something people call the Grace of killing, and as such, is used and manipulated by her uncle to commit heinous crimes (assassinations, beatings) in the silent name of the kingdom. People stay away from her because rumors say she can kill a man with her bare hands.    The worst part is, the rumors are right. But Kasta hates her Grace, hates what people think she represents. But then along comes Po, a mysterious prince from a kingdom far away, and together they go on an adventure where Katsa soon learns that there is perhaps more to her than her Grace alone.    I wouldn't say this book particularly resonated deeply with me, but I will say that it is has a very interesting premise. A girl with a killing Grace? Sign me up! Katsa is a headstrong, stubborn girl with a broken past and a very interesting skill. All her life she has been controlled by her uncle, and she wants to break free. It was fascinating to see her slowly learn to trust the people around her--even learn to trust enough to love.    I will just let you know up front that Graceling is pretty heavy on the romance. The entire revelation/character development of Katsa hinges on her friendship and then budding romance with Po. I'm not saying that it's not a healthy relationship, but the book does use alot of the notions of \\"falling in love\\" to drive the MC into having the revelations about herself that she does. Then again, friendship and love. Aren't those two things why revelations happen in real life anyways?    The problem with this book is that Katsa borders on Mary Sue perfection. She is the unstoppable machine: she never gets tired, has great memory, can kill with her bare hands. I suppose the only weakness she really has is that she is an absolute emotional wreck. And you know, I can't blame her. Only someone who has had their freedom taken away from them can truly value independence. (BTW: Parents might want to pre-read this book ahead of time--some of Katsa's choices do not fall in line with certain conservative values we see in society today, i.e., marriage)    Admittedly I read this entire book in one sitting, so my views on it are generally still positive despite any of the concerns I've noted above. Graceling is highly addicting, fast paced, and definitely not the \\"underdog\\" type stories. That being said, you as a reader never truly wonder if this girl is in any real danger. I mean, she knows a hundred ways to kill a man. What's there to be worried about?    But the villian. Ooh, I lieked him. I give you kudos for that, Kristin. Exactly the type of person to go against Katsa's Grace. Like yin to the yang. Would have liked it better if you stretched out his scenes a little though. Seems a little hurried near the ending and it didn't give me the satisfaction of a solid conclusion.    See full review at [...]
B007URVZJ6|4.0|Before attempting to publish on Kindle I would recommend reading this book and then would read it again as you start to write and/or are ready publish.<br /><br />The steps are fairly easy to follow but could be difficult for a new person that needs a visual as well as written instruction.<br /><br />Your biggest frustrations are likely to be the table of contents and the book cover which are not clearly explained.<br /><br />The book cover is actually uploaded separately from the manuscript (book).  They are both uploaded to Amazon at the same time but the cover is uploaded by itself and then the manuscript.<br /><br />I have also found that the table of contents is also easier to format and  create in HTML rather than in Word which is recommended.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like this game because its fun to play when I'm board and cool to unlock new games. its very addicting!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Fun mystery for the money. I would buy something like this again. It was habit forming, like reading a good book. I would recommend it to anyone.
B000SEGUDE|3.0|I watched the movie trailer and based on that ordered the book.  However, I was dissatisfied with the overall novel.  Each section/story line was enjoyable but they were disjointed and disconnected.  By the end of the novel, very few threads tied the sections together into a believable novel.  There was no culminating connection at the end either.  I was left feeling as if I had read 3 or 4 different mini novels in one cover.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Kate Morton never disappoints.  Each of her works pulls in the reader and keeps them there.  The Secret Keeper is no exception, in fact, it may be her best to date.  Having read all of her books, I knew to expect a twist at the end and boy did she deliver!
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|I watched this movie with my daughter, who is 13, and we truly enjoyed it.  There was a lot of darkness and death, but we loved the ending.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is so addicting and fun!  For all you haters that put 1 or 2 stars... WHAT THE CRAP IS WRONG WITH YOU???
B004DLPXAO|4.0|I have only bee using this App for a couple wekks and I have no complaints. I was one of those hardcore, never going to purchase and read electronic books, well that has changed. I purchased my first table (Galaxy Tab 2) a couple weeks ago, got this app and have had absolutely no probelms with it.
B0086700CM|5.0|this game is really cool! I really like it. although every once in a while it will glitches for like 2seconds
B008KTA64S|5.0|The sound is instantly familiar to Gaslight Anthem fans while being new and just different enough to keep you coming back. Love the energy and feeling. Brian Fallon and company have yet to dissapoint. A great addition on the Deluxe Edition is their cover of Tom Petty's \\"You Got Lucky\\".
B008QE9VJI|5.0|If you're a fan of Tim Burton and Johnny Depp, you'll like this movie.  I also watched the old Dark Shadows series on Netflix when I heard that this movie was coming out to get an idea of what they were remaking.  That series is so bad that it's actually good.  I can see why it's had a cult following.
B009HXG9UQ|4.0|We really enjoyed this film.  It's odd, but in a really good way, in an endearing, sweet way.  I like movies that don't fit an archetype or neat little predictable box. My 18 year old son son saw this in the theater this summer, and raved about it, so the rest of the family was eager to see it when it was released to DVD/Instant. Highly recommended.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|I looked forward very much to viewing this DVD and found it highly entertaining and amusing. I was a huge fan of the original Dark Shadows and the new version with my favorite actor as the title charactor, was just too good to pass up. I enjoyed every moment of it and haved watched it many times already! I wish it had been longer!
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I am glad that there is not as much background given as in the last book.....Kay fans know that stuff.  I'm enjoying it and couldn't put it down.<br />Thanks
1451620829|5.0|I gave Peter Criss's book 5 stars because he doesn't hold back and that includes very bad things he says about himself. The best thing about this book is that he owns up to his own short comings as well as his former band mates (I don't think Kiss will be selling this at their shows) and  because there is very little \\"I heard from this guy\\" or \\"I heard her say...\\"  If you are a fan of Kiss you will like this book for its honesty and if you are a fan-asty believer, you might not. This book is not boring to say the least.
B005IQZB14|5.0|Great book. Very entertaining, easy read that anyone can relate to. I would definately read more of this authors books. Inspiring story, makes you want to go out and hike!
B003N7ORNI|5.0|a good book bit slow in places and seemed to go on a bit in others overall fun read now onto book 2
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|Chris Evans does an excellent job as our hero Captain American. The story has lots of action. The villain is the evil Red skull played delightfully by Hugo Weaving. This movie tells the story how Captain America came about and his first great adventure.  A fun movie that will be enjoyed. See it.
B0053O89KG|5.0|Fun ride with great characters. Plots with many twists and turns. Can't stop watching. Good thing there are about 20 episodes per season. Red herring anyone?
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|I must say that Red is a great movie. Bruce Willis, Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich & Helen Mirren give great performances. Someone is trying to kill Retired CIA agents. When someone comes into Frank's ( Bruce Willis) house and starts shooting the fun begins. Frank gets the old gang together and they find out who is trying to kill them, and they go after them. This movie has lots action and is fun to watch. You will enjoy it.
B007OWRBJK|4.0|Enjoyable read even for non Who fans. Very honest .fun to follow the genesis of the songs. Obviously written by Pete Townshend. Memo.to.pop stars write your own songs and retain the publishing.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|Outstanding reading, its as if you watching a Movie!!!!!<br />Finally a Book a person can relate too. Not just your run of the Mill Fantasy Book.<br />Very Good!!!
B002UBRFDC|5.0|I had read this book many years ago, when it was first published. A repeat showing of the TV miniseries on cable renewed my interest, so I purchased it for my kindle.<br />Very engrossing book plot-wise with interesting characters. The culture clash, of course, is the big issue. Who are the real barbarians? Bonus points in regard to exposure to the Japanese language, world shaping religious struggles and the culture & politics at the time both in Japan and in Europe. Good read! An old fashion \\"I just can't put this down until I finish it\\" book!
B009ZQC4HW|4.0|This was a relief from the last episode. I felt like we were getting back on track with Supernatural. There was still a little too much story line taken up by a secondary character for me, but all in all a good show. At least this one moved the story line along for both Dean and Sam. We got more background on each brother. I am wondering though if the show has totally new writers.
B001HBYHFA|5.0|This is a good follow up to the Firefly tv show. The characters are well thought out and played very well by each actor.
B008KE3960|5.0|It took me a few tries to figure out the best strategy and now I setup looping paths for the planes to follow.  The game is a lot of fun, easy to learn, and a good upgrade to the tower defense genre.  Addicting though, be careful!<br /><br />Playing with kindle fire hd.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a great game.  Lots of levels & degrees of difficulty.  Not boring like some of the card games.
B0083P1QUM|2.0|too detailed on forensic issues . ending seems hastily written to wrap things up and leaves a lot to speculation
B005EGXTL2|5.0|the first hunger games is hard to put down. Catching fire was good but felt a little to familiar. Mocking jay recaptured the want to read on and takes the hunger games into a deeper and more captivating place. It may not be the best book ever written but its one of the most readable.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|If you can get past the gore, you're going to enjoy this dark comedy spoof.  Poking fun at rednecks and slasher flicks, are great entertainment. Add this to your collection, and enjoy nonstop laughs from beginning to end.
1423140605|5.0|It was a very interesting good book and the plot was mind-boggling. I love the way Rick Riordan made the sequence of the plot. I can see clearly the challenge in this, how he managed to create the story from the perspective of different characters and connect each to main plotline. I love how he made the characters interact with each other and even it's a contributing factor on how the story flows. It has a well-balanced narrative. Every single page, every single chapter held surprises and excitement, I could barely put the book down. I really love how the author twisted and turned the story on existing myths to create a new plotline and woven them altogether to create an exciting adventure. The ending proved to be more interesting, it's a railroad to climax - a cliff-hanger!<br />There is nothing I dislike about the book, the story is morphed to an absolute thrill and excitement only the likes of Rick Riordan can deliver. He just scored a \\"knock-out punch\\" for a book with a pack of adventure.. I hardly can't wait for the next book, \\"The House of Hades\\".
B004V5A7K8|2.0|Low resolution and laggy port of a phone game to a high res tablet.  This game is not even worth free.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|interesting and easy to use on my fire. the graphics are well designed and surprisingly detailed and flow with grace
B008TMA1LY|5.0|My grandaughter played for hours she seems to really enjoy this game.<br />I would recommend this game my grandaughter is 6 yrs old.
B003UESJ9M|5.0|I really love this movie.  To be honest, the very first time I watched it, I was disappointed in the depressing nature of it, but I have now watched it at least 20 times since and LOVE it.  It's definitely a watch more than once movie.
B009IKPOUO|5.0|I adore Barbara, but I have to say I'm sooooo glad she released this collection from her vault.  I especially loved How are things in Gloccamorra. For fans a must.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|As I read each of the three I kept asking myself, \\"why am I reading this?\\", as each book was less than the previous.<br />Yeah, I could feel for the characters evolution, yada, yada, yada.  I guess I can admit to reading all 3 just as a form of tittilation!
B008JMKN4Y|2.0|I bought this book thinking it would be a light read and fun. It was, but it could have been so much better.  It is not believable.  The college experience is phony.  The fighting, the Vegas mob, the money...not really.
B007QUUJMG|2.0|This book takes a really bad look at child abuse and Asperger's.  The main character is meant to be a genius, and yet his writing style is completely infantile, to the point of being annoying.  This is one of those books where it comes across that the author does not understand his subject well enough, instead you get the Wikipedia version of autism.<br /><br />I was livid that I had to pay such a high price on Kindle for such an epically boring book.  I think the only reason this has been made into a movie is that the name is incredibly cool.<br /><br />If you are planning on reading this book because you think it's about being an outsider in high school, then don't bother, that's not this book.  And please, do not get me started on the premise, the entire book is anonymous letters mailed to a stranger.  So lame.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Run out of energy too fast. Takes too long to rejuvenate. Wants you to use FB or Twitter and I do not want to.
B008602KQI|5.0|Great purchase and easy down load. Highly recommend readimg for any age. Loved it! It was hard to put down
B007THA4FI|3.0|It took a bit to get into the book.  It's not an easy read the way the Potter books are, but a compelling story.
B003Y5H542|5.0|This is a very funny movie, with humor for people from ages 5 to 105. The many different characters are amazing, both their looks and their actions.  Jonny Depp is great as Rango.
B005LAIGWS|5.0|After the release of the 2007 version I didn't much care for it. Mostly because when it came out on DVD I didn't watch it as many times as I did this one. The blu-ray for this one was so clear and crystal in sound. If only all movies come out with the same blu-ray treatment this one did. The action was non stop. I loved the fact that the \\"Crank\\" creator's Mark Neveldine and Brian Taylor did not add a sappy love story to this one unlike the other one. They know how to make good fast paste action. I can only hope that with Neveldine/Taylor and Nicolas Cage retuning they will make a direct sequel to this one. I put it like that because the action style and camra movements is what seperated this one from the other one. Plus different filmmakers other than Nic. Columbia Pictures bring us MORE!!
B008KE3960|5.0|This is a wonderfully entertaining take on classic tower defenses. Even without purchasing any of the extra content it's a blast. Don't be scared away by the one star reviews complaining about the in app purchasing.
B00A1ZW1JC|5.0|Season 2 of The Walking Dead felt so slow and drama filled I almost didn't even bother with season 3. I'm glad I stuck around, this episode is one of the most gruesome and heart-wrenching episodes yet IMHO. I didn't think about the title of the episode until I after I watched it, 'Killer Within' can be taken at least 2 different ways that I can think of. Can't wait to see where this all goes.
B009UWYFFK|5.0|One of the best movies I've seen!!! My children and I loved it!!! Will definitely be buying it on DVD
B006LSZECO|1.0|The plot is compelling but the characters are flat.  WHY does the author need to pepper every page with multiple obscenities? Clearly the intent is to create \\"real people\\" with flaws that propell them toward disaster.  They would have been just as real without their infantile reliance on vulgar vocabulary.
B008Q09K2U|5.0|I love John Corey and all the other Nelson DeMille characters.  To me, only Lee Child's Jack Reacher compares.  I gave 5 stars to The Panther though it's not my favorite.  Most of the rest deserve six stars. Just wish the books would come out quicker!  Loved seeing Paul Brenner as a supporting cast member.  Now I'll need to reread Up Country for the fifth time because he deserves a new book of his own.  Anyone who isn't familiar with DeMille's work should start at the first and keep reading to stay in sync. They're a gem.
0978545095|5.0|Wow! As I read Vivian Maier: Out of the Shadows, I felt I was standing next to Emily Dickenson, not with a quill, but a camera in her hand. She was not in the 1840s in Amherst, Massachusetts, but reincarnated in my Chicago area neck of the woods as recently as 2005.I was standing next to her and treasured her insights as she took each picture. I personally have a library of more than a dozen books on or by Emily Dickinson and I made room for this book to sit on the shelf with them. As I read deeper in the book and had viewed hundreds of her extraordinary ordinary photographs, I discovered that the compilers of her work, Rich Cahan and Michael Williams, had the same parallel universe experience.  Try it. You will more than like it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I didn't expect this novel to turn the way it did.  About half-way through, I was slammed with a twist that I never saw coming.  It was awesome!  I've never read any of Gillian Flynn's work before, but I definitely want to download more of her novels now!  Amazing!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I used to use my iphone's notepad but recently switched to this so I could access my notes on my kindle fire as well. Add the pics you can put with the notes and you have a real winner.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Really liked the book, big fan of Nelson DeMille and he did not disappoint.  Loved the acerbic wit of John Corey and the action.
B003ZD9DUC|5.0|the nr 1 ever,former movie to all good car and action movies>! and cheap to! so run and buy suckers!
B004GHNIRK|2.0|I wanted to read this story before the movie musical came out.  I knew that it was sad but I did not realize how DEPRESSING it is.  The world is not such a dark and nasty place.  Most folks aren't evil or selfish.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|Ladies, this is a must have DVD. Let me tell you, its HOT! The guys are hot and do some pretty erotic strip teases.  Its worth it, just for that!!!! If you like sexy hot men, you'll love it.  LOL.  Enjoy!
B007MB5OCE|5.0|If you liked Forrest Gump, you are going to love this tale of fantastic coincidences that may have shaped world history.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This is a really good puzzle.  You never get bored with it.  I've gone through the whole thing several times and love it every time.
B006O2QNOU|4.0|If you own stocks or follow the market, you'll find this movie engrossing.  If you don't know what a margin call is, probably won't relate to the movie.  The cast was brilliant and I enjoyed the slow pacing.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Very exciting, suspenseful read! I have missed John Corey! Do not start this before going to bed... You will be up late!
B009AJDDQU|4.0|incredible cinamatography, excellent acting from the main cast, and satisfies your Aliens in the abyss craving. However do yourself a favor and DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILER.  It gives away the entire plot and ending.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Such a great read!! So better than fifty!! These characters are written in depth!!  It's more than just just physical bonding happening from cover to cover!! It's so refreshing that the heroine is strong and independent!! Luv luv luv!!! Can't wait til book 3!!!!
B006OAB3ME|4.0|First of all, this is a JAZZ record, made with top-jazz musicians, great arrangers and the best production team available in the music business.  I think this is the first time Paul McCartney doesn't play any instrument, his only concern is to sing, and the voice couldn't be better. In a blindfold test, my friends weren't able to tell who was the singer, only that he was English, that is a proof of how serious Paul was in a passionate reason to record these standard tunes.  This is my favorite Paul \\"Macca\\" McCartney record. The songs are great, all of them well played and sung.  Eric's guitar is just wonderful on \\"My Valentine\\", and is the only song you can spot Paul's regular vocals. The other one you can spot Paul is on, the also original, \\"Only Our Hearts\\".  A concept album made for valentines on Valentine's Day !  Well McCartney is almost 70 years-old, and after 50 years of great rock and roll success, he has the courage of letting everyone know how much he listened to the songs that his father loved and sang. I got really moved when \\"Always\\" by I. Berlin started, a song that I've only heard by my Jazz Icon Bill Evans on the \\"Trio '64\\" album. Just great !!!!  Since this is his first jazz record and he did a great job, I really wish he will come back once more, loose a little bit, and deliver one thing he is familiar with: making dreams come true and masterpieces.  Macca's Jazz Quartet:  Paul McCartney - Vocals  Diana Krall - Piano  Robert Hurst - Bass  John Pizzarelli - Guitar  Karriem Riggins - Drums  with: Anthony Wilson, Eric Clapton, Stevie Wonder, Mike Mainieri, Tamir Hendelman, John Clayton, Jeff Hamilton and Bucky Pizzarelli.

B008673ZAQ|4.0|Great book! Enjoyed it better than the first one.  This series is the first time I have read Sylvia Day however will search for another by her.  Don't like the length between the books. I read a good deal and forgot some details from book one. Looking forward to book three to see how author completes the story.
B000WTZ784|1.0|The songs are all about characters who are self-absorbed and self-pitying.  Hard to believe that Banks and Rutherford were involved in the writing of those classic Genesis records of the 70s.  On this one, it sounds to me as though they had no inspiration left.  I would have loved to have seen them invite Hackett and Phillips back into the band and made beautiful Genesis music again, regardless of whatever the trends were at the time.  Wilson was ill-served by the adolescent \\"I-Me-Mine\\" lyrics they gave him to sing.
B009JNQ86Y|5.0|Just stunningly beautiful and emotive! Ellie's voice is out of this world and so unique. I've listened to the album about 20 times and I still can't get enough!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Seriously, you should get this book. The fact that you are here means you are interested. Don't waste another dangblammed second and GET IT! I'd be willing to throw myself down a flight of stairs to get this book it was so darn good.<br /><br />A good friend recommended this book to me and boy am I glad he did! What an incredible read. Like some of the other reviews, I had a hard time putting this book down. It was a very refreshing read. Very different than other books in the way Hugh spins this yarn. I am jumping over to get First Shift which is the prequel to this story now, otherwise I would probably have to punch myself in the face.<br /><br />The Wool series would make an INCREDIBLE graphic novel! In fact (and this is a bit bizarre) I actually saw it in my head as one. Lemme explain...I read the book at night just before bed. It was my nightly routine to read it on my iPad in bed just before zonking out. On one of the nights, after an extremely busy day, I started to doze and I actually had a dream that I was reading the story in graphic novel form. I could actually SEE the panels! It was very cool actually, so HUGH, if you read this, make this happen, mkay?<br /><br />Anyway, I hope you get the book and enjoy it as much as I did. I will return and review First Shift once I finish! Hope its as good as WOOL!
B0053JJLLC|4.0|Good sci fi,once i got into it. I'm not the biggest sc fi fan,and the concept seemed preposterous, but its gripping if you give it a chance.
B009IU6N5Y|3.0|Lots of action, well-acted, and entertaining, but I can't quite get past the use of Abraham Lincoln in this type of story.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book, turned the last page and immediately logged onto Amazon to purchase the next one. I had been slightly sceptical thinking that maybe it was more of a teenagers novel but believe me, I'm 47 and usually a reader of psychotic thrillers and I could not put it down. It was exciting, different and had every element needed to ensure a great read.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|You know a book is special when you start to write a review three times before giving up and going to the thesaurus to find words stronger than incredible.  From start to finish Wool delivers a stark dystopian society with characters that are beautifully rendered, sympathetic, realistic and ultimately beloved.  What makes Wool wonderful to read and miserable to review is that the plot is unlike anything else I have read.  I don't want to spoil anything so I will just say you are constantly kept off guard wondering why the people are living in a post-apocalyptic hell and who is/are the bad guys and why do they want to send people to die for expressing the wrong thoughts.  When you start to figure it out the book kicks into high gear and weaves a fantastic action packed conclusion.<br /><br />This book is one of the very best I have ever read.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|I felt the book was good, but not nearly as interesting as the first book in the series.  Hopefully the next one will be better.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|This is because you can just get temple run, which has no lag.This game is a lot  slower than TR.Also, sometimes when you turn your character left, it will turn right.
1401324649|4.0|If you want a hilarious history lesson of not just events in the last 80 or so years, but of political leaders such as Stalin, Churchill, Kim Jong Il, the Shah of Iran, Henry Truman and Mao Tze Tung to name but a few, this is the book to be read and chortled over.<br /><br />Allan Karlsson of Sweden, living in an old folks' home, decides on the morning of his 100th birthday, to climb out of the window and get himself a bottle of vodka. But why stop at vodka, why stay in this place at all when he's not having any fun and Director Alice has too many rules. And so he takes off in his bedroom slippers and shuffles along, over a wall, which is no mean feat for someone his age, and makes his way to the bus station.<br /><br />And from that point, the fun starts. He meets a young man who asks him to look after his large suitcase while he goes to the bathroom. But before he returns, Allan's bus arrives so what is he to do? He makes a spur of the moment decision to take the suitcase with him, and from that point on, he embarks on a journey in which he meets a poacher, a failed academic who now owns a failing hotdog stand, a woman with an escaped elephant and an injured gang leader.<br />Oh and the police now have an arrest warrant out for him and his gang.<br /><br />Alternating chapters with segments of his life from the time his father left him as a boy, through the years when he discovered a penchant for understanding and building explosives, we follow his incredible and hilarious journey through Sweden, China, America, the USSR, Tehran, Indonesia, France and North Korea, meeting world leaders and inadvertently playing a part in certain epic events, not the least, how the atom bomb was invented.<br /><br />I've not been so entertained in a long time.
B009FZZK8I|5.0|This is one of the best TV shows ever. I sick of police shows or comedys! This is so different its mezmorizing!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|First, if you like Temple Run you will LOVE Subway Surfers. I prefer it because I don't have to tilt my kindle for any of the controls because often times it doesn't work on Temple Run and I can't mover left to right. But about Subway Surfers I must say it is amazing. I never expected a game like this. It is fun and addicting, and it is easy for a while until it gets faster because you are still going. Great game overall. One of the best ever I guess.
B005EGXTHG|3.0|I found this book a little less interesting than the first in the series (The Hunger Games), although I get the impression that this book is just a bridge between the first and the third. However, it does its job and definitely makes you want to carry on reading the series.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Absolutely gripping time travel novel by Steven King.  This was one book I did not want to end... loved it a lot
B008OOYALE|2.0|the game is slow to respond on my kindle. all the actions take their sweet time for no apparent reason.
0525952926|5.0|This book is a sequel to Fall of Giants which followed seven families - Welsh English, German, Russian and American - through the cataclysmic events from 1912 through 1923. I thought it was quite a good book even if the characters were a little thin, the writing read something like a military bulletin (devoid of emotion) and because of the explicit sex scenes it should have been delivered anonymously in a plain paper binding.<br /><br /> The same criticism can be said of this book; but , having said that, the fact remains that it's a darned good book. It will never get a prize for literary excellence. It will never be assigned reading for high school history students. But if you read it I guarantee that you will find at the end of the day - and at the end of its some 900 plus pages - satisfaction in having read a good story and having been reminded again - and fairly accurately -  of the awful events which happened in our world from 1933 - 46: the rise of Hitler's Germany, the insane \\"cleansing\\" of the Aryan \\"race\\" from the Jews and Jewish influence, the beginning and end of World War II, the bombing of Britain, the Russian War and the Russian conquest of Germany plus the rape of Berlin and all the rest of the events which all of us of the age lived through, knew and were a part of during that time -  when we never knew whether we would be alive at the end of it or not. So there are many witnesses to the truth of Follett's story and this writer is one of them.<br /><br /> Yes, there's a little too much British politics thrown in  - particularly Labour politics which Foollett obviously supports whole heartedly, but which most of u in America could have done without. And one has the same problem in keeping track of the various characters  in this book one had in Fall of Giants. But, believe me, it's worth it.<br /><br /> Do we meet the same characters in this book that we met in Fall? Yes we do; and if we don't met them we meet their children. So it's worth it. And ifyou can' figure them out I recommend going on the internet and click on the characters list for each book.<br /><br /> And, now, before signing off I want to recount an incident in the book where Follett made me feel good, where he got it right. Remember Gregory Peshkov from Fall? (He's the brother who stayed in Russia, helped storm the Winter Palace and became a leading Revolutionary) Well, his oldest son Voloyda (Vladimir) is now in the NKVD and the Russians know that the US is developing an Atom bomb (as are they) but they don't know which \\"plan\\" the US is going with - Little Boy or a bigger one . Voloyda, loyal Soviet that he is, is sent in disguise as a Russian tourist or some such to the US - actually to Alamos, NM to contact one of Dr. Oppenheimer's team who is loyal to the Soviets -  to fined out the answer to their problem. He  has always had the opinion that the US is greatly inferior to Communism and the Russian State. However, when he gets off the boat, he takes a train and travels for two full days across America seeing who we are and what we have (takes him that long to cross the country!) and he returns to Russia with the desired information but having actually our seen country he has a different perception of the US than when he left. I loved it! Wish we could show it to more people like Voloyda with the same result!<br /><br /> Go read the book and enjoy yourself!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|the games seem simple at first but the harder levels become more challenging... its entertaining and fun...PLUS ITS FREE...great app worth downloading
B007VUA7VO|5.0|very convenient and I like that I can change the Color and this app has easy access. looks professional yet trendy
B009NQKPUW|5.0|I thought Prometheus was well-written and Ridley Scott redeemed himself with this movie. There were moments where I was truly terrified...and that's a hard thing to do for me. There are a few scenes where the squeamish should look away but all in all, it was brilliant and well-directed.
B0087JTAKW|4.0|A simple nice meaningful read. Well worth the time to evaluate your own connection to time. Mitch Albom seems to have a knack for writing books that seem like they were written for me personally.
B005IEF27O|5.0|Crank this cd and sit back to chill however you prefer to chill. Awesomeness is all I can say. Sweet.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love this series. It was interesting reading about finding love bin hopeless places. I also enjoyed reading about how a person can transform into something from nothing. I fill the story would have been different if it came from Christian's point of view tho.
B002QUWYWE|5.0|this is one of the best movies Ever! Full of suspense and always a twist. great actors!<br />We watched this many times
B003O86FMW|5.0|So fun to read!! I was so glued to the book. I didn't want to put the book down. I wanted to get right to the next book!!
B004LQGXPA|5.0|Great, great movie!  This movie shows General George S. Patton Jr. in a true light.  Definitely the \\"very best\\" combat general in any army during World War 2.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This was a great way to wrap up this trilogy. Left feeling satisfied with where everyone needed up  there were no annoying unanswered questions.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is awesome its so much fun you should get it. you will have lots of fun with this game.:)
B004JZBGWI|4.0|simple yet it has all the tools necessary to orginize your lists or to do tasks.  I have used other note apps and none compare to this one so far.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|the person who created this app stole it from temple run. its hard to use I did what it told me but it did the opposite.  I would not get it.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked this book. A good ending to a very successful and entertaining series. I recommend buying it or borrowing it. You won't regret it
B001RP1G0U|5.0|This is a cute, light romantic comedy that looks at the difficulties and pressures of dating after divorce. The movie features several well- known actors and actresses who give excellent performances. I could easily watch this movie again and get equal enjoyment out of it.
B002RT69QQ|5.0|EXELENTE PRODUCTO. EXELENTE RELACION PRECIO CALIDAD. MUY BUENA PRESENTACION Y CUMPLIMIENTO POR PARTE DEL VENDEDOR DE ACUERDO A LO PACTADO.
B000OZ0NXA|3.0|There was too much detail in the story.  The story was ok.  The discription of every little thing was too much and it was not very believable the way Reacher figured out every little thing.  Over all I did not care for the book.
B003YGSLDA|5.0|The aniversary movie was just as clear and vibrent as the first ime I saw the film at the theater. It is one for the ages that should be in everyons collection.
B004DI7HZ6|3.0|Once the plot really started going, this book picked up steam for me, but I thought the beginning was incredibly overwritten and there was way too much telling and not enough showing. There were occasional moments of \\"yes, we get it, you've described this in exquisitely boring detail, how about those plot points now?\\" but I did enjoy the story overall and have requested the second book from the library to give it a try.
0857685848|3.0|I found some really great dinosaur art in this book, and my 11 yr old son and I have spent hours looking and talking about it.<br />  However, there is some lesser work and some non-dinosaur work in the book as well.  When you call a book \\"Dinosaur Art\\" and I open it to a page with some ancient marsupials chilling in the veldt, its a let down.<br />  The greatness of a dinosaur art book is a function of quality art + number of teeth. So this loses a star for the marsupials.<br />  Also, they chose 10 or so artists and showcased them.  I thought from the title it would be the best dinosaur art ever created, regardless of who did it.  Gregory Paul has been my hero for 20 yrs but I expected there would be some of James Gurneys work inside, so was disappointed.  And it loses another star for that.<br />  Nevertheless, there is some very good dinosaur art in this book, and that has been enjoyable.
1451627289|5.0|Don't we all daydream about such things? What it would be like to go back in the past, just to see what things were like in your own neighborhood in another era--or perhaps to go back, to fix your most regretted mistake in life--or even to play hero and rescue the world from some historical disaster? This book delves into a world where such things are possible. But what are the consequences? If things go as planned, will the intended result of your heroism pan out? Will even mundane occurrences in your time-traveling adventures have unforeseen costs? 11/22/63 blends fact with fantasy in a way that you will experience with all the senses. I could not help but care so deeply about the characters as to be driven to tears at times, and many others have had the same experience with it. As wild as 'historical revisionist sci-fi' sounds, this book was fascinating, fun and deeply moving. I'm finally through all 849 pages and am sad just to have to leave the fantastic, nostalgic world of this story behind. A truly valuable, though heartbreaking, experience .
B007GCY8FS|3.0|I have read all of the Reacher novels, and this is not one of the best. It does not contain as much action as most of the other novels, and not as much plot development.
0345803485|5.0|I could barely put this book down because I enjoyed it so much!  This was my first time reading an erotica book or anything with the BDSM lifestyle so I didn't have anything to compare it to unlike some of the reviewers.  I liked how the author wrote from Ana's point of view, but it would be interesting to read it from Christian's point of view.  I look forward to reading the next 2 books!
B009NPM5Y2|4.0|Great music selection and the actors did a good job not making it Toooooo cheesey.  Tom Cruise is classic and Balwin is the perfect Whiskey a Go Go owner you could find!!
0547258305|5.0|This book is wonderful! It takes a little patience in the beginning as the setting is established in the first chapter or two, but it is definitely worth it. It's a very unique world, excellently depicted and keeps you engulfed until the very end.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Compelling story with excellent character development. I particularly liked how the various storylines were interwoven. I am looking forward to reading part 2.
1595141715|4.0|I'm finding it difficult to critique a book that contains a heavy subject such as found in this book.  My mind is cluttered with cargo loads of thoughts and I'm having a hard time sifting and collaborating them to something that is concise and neat.  So let's see where my typing fingers take us!  Here goes...<br /><br />The writing style was interesting and so it was easy to move from one page to the next.  It's how the characters carry the serious subject matter that gets edgy.  As an adult, we might be quick to judge those that seek suicide as a resolve to problems.  One might say that it's a coward's way out.  Perhaps that is what some readers see of Hannah Baker.  But we have to remember that Hannah is a teenager and the book is addressing teen suicide.  At that age, many think that the world revolves around them.  It's a vulnerable age of discovering and developing oneself.  Everyone around them can be influential.  Henceforth, they're still children.  So this book actually portrays the struggles of teenagers fairly accurately.  You're going to find:  labeling, promiscuity, deceit, rebellion, back stabbing, recklessness, etc.  You're also going to find an array of emotions ... anger, love, jealousy, fear, hate, denial, etc. etc.  And in this particular case, Clay and Hannah were at opposite ends of the 'how to deal with life' spectrum.  That is why Clay is ignorant and Hannah careless.  That's how the author molded them to be, as examples not the rule.  The purpose of their stories was to help convey the destructive potential of one's affect on another, hence the 13 reasons why.  In other words, what a seemingly harmless act might be detrimental to another.<br /><br />You've made the author happy because you got the message if:  you've made a vow to be more careful in how you deal with people; if you're a teenager that can relate to Hannah but know better how to reach for help; if you're more aware of the signs of someone contemplating suicide and act promptly;or if you could relate to the guilt trip that the \\"13\\" felt.  Then I like to add that it's not practical to go tip-toeing through life for the sake of the weak.  Instead we must arm our children with confidence, wisdom, and security so that they can make better decisions.<br /><br />This book is not without flaws, but the essential message is there for the taking.<br /><br />My quote-ables:<br />\\"I want to push Stop on the Walkman and rewind their whole conversation... But I can't.  You can't rewrite the past.\\" pg 60.<br />\\"And that's why I put you on these tapes.  To let you know that what you do affects others.  More specifically, it affected me.\\" pg 95.<br />\\"I guess that's the point of it all.  No one knows for certain how much impact they have on the lives of other people.  Oftentimes, we have no clue.\\" pg 156.<br />\\"You can't go back to how things were.  How you thought they were.  All you really have...is now.\\" pg 206.<br /><br />Review written 9/28/10
B009KHDT0C|5.0|Movie was awesome, per usual for Johnny Depp. You have to love his sense of humor & quirkiness. Although it is starting to get hard to separate him from Edward Scissorhands & Captain Jack. Still, a good watch.
B009IQ0TGM|4.0|Ellie has made a very deep and darker album. I believe it's a fitting transition into her sophomore effort. She pulled it off. I do agree with some critics that her hooks need to be \\"hookier\\". But she really made a solid album. \\"In My City\\", \\"My Blood\\", \\"Figure 8\\", and \\"Dead in the Water\\" are my stand out tracks. Go Ellie!
1400032717|5.0|I had to read this book for class and it was amazing. I never wanted to put the book down!
B00000K0E5|5.0|Pierce Brosnan makes a great James Bond and Goldeneye is great fun. It is well worth the purchase price and then some.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|This was a good follow up to the first book and I cannot wait unitl the next one comes out.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Coin dozer is an awesome app. It's fun and highly addicitve. I wish that the coins would be rewarded more quickly when you are offline. I haven't had any technical issues with the app. Highly recommended for people of all ages..
B001PJRAUS|5.0|Have you ever felt drawn into a book so much that you felt like you were there? Lost in Austen portrays that in a way that you, also, feel drawn into the story. How many women have dreamed of Fitzwilliam Darcy? An interesting twist on Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, but well worth watching
B000FC2OHA|5.0|While I read the 'hard back' years ago, I recently added this to my Kindle for easy access any time I wanted a little inspiration or motivation.  Each principle is about 7-10 pages for easy reading with lots of practical, how-to ideas.  It's one of my favorite personal development books -- and I've recommended it to numerous clients, colleagues and friends.
B005CRQ3LG|4.0|Bought this for my 18-mo niece. As young as she is, this caught her attention. The first time round, she was very quiet -- the second, sound activated.
B000NDMRDW|5.0|The Best Movie Ever,  I like these types of movies.  The actors were great I see this movie<br />all the time and I would recommend this movie to anyone.  Does this movie look familiar.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|The movie was cute and engaging.  The story line was very nice and relevent to teach children.  The graphics was beautiful.
B000YHG72E|5.0|I bought this on BLUE-RAY from amazon and got a \\"free instant stream\\" with it, That was a great selling point too. My product arrived in great condition and it was great to watch it in better quality than my old VHS, Always liked this movie for its simplicity to just laugh and Will Ferrell's \\"over-reaction\\" acting. Good to watch all the behind the scenes extras and stuff too.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Fantastic CD. I really enjoy listening to this great singer. The CD arrived ahead of time. It is amazing how music can bring me right back to a different time in my life.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|Like a typical Stephen King book, this one too started out slow with long descriptions of the characters and their surroundings. But once the story got started, it was hard to put it down. It was an amazing rush to keep reading. Some of the parts were predictable but were still enjoyable. The ending, in my opinion, was hurried. Maybe the writer wanted to leave space for a second part or something else, but I thought the points picked could have been explained a little bit more and could have picked a middle ground in outlook instead of such strongly towards one specific outlook. Overall, it is a very enjoyable read during a vacation or a long flight.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show is addictive. I don't have Showtime, so Amazon is the way I watched this show.<br />I bought the season.<br />Rapid fire, back to back viewing.<br />The best.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game app has many different levels for lots of challenges. The levels can become very difficult, so it will keep you engaged and entertained for a while.
B008133JZG|5.0|I have only one problem with this show: it needs more episodes more often.  Well, that's kind of two problems.  Oh well.  Sherlock is really very enjoyable.
B005HSL626|1.0|this game is not fun there are to many adds . this game will also freeze and a black screene will pop up.
B00005JM02|5.0|I love this movie and everything about it. It has great color and great voice-overs. It is wonderful if your looking for a movie to just sit down with someone and watch. You wont be able to take your eyes off it. So much love and comedy in the movie, it makes you love everything about the sea and the fish in it.<br />I recommend this movie and you will too once you have watched it.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|It wasn't what I was expecting... I was honestly expecting better, but it wasn't the worst alien movie I've ever seen. so it was just ok but I won't be buying the bluray or the download
B006LSZECO|3.0|A good,well written book that kept me entertained and was a page turner. I'm giving it 3 stars for how it ended.
B0099G6Q5E|5.0|Ordered this as soon as we got home from the theater!  LOVED the movie and LOVE the soundtrack!  Listen to it all the time and can't wait to see the movie again!!
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I have been waiting for the 3D release of this movie since the original release of the movie.  It was definitely worth getting and the quality of the 3D is far superior to that of most other films on the market even though the technology is older.  This was a very well made movie with a great story.
B007BT0RKG|4.0|this app works pretty well.. just downloaded it and tested it out before going anywhere.. you need to zoom in to see the streets that aren't main highways and other main roads.. will be downloading surrounding states as well.
B004SEUJ82|5.0|One of the mst heart breaking movies I have seeing. It's a must see! Me and my daughter were crying thru out the whole movie.
B003YFIUW8|5.0|It took me about 3 minutes to become engrossed in this little book. During one part specifically, I was on the edge of my seat. If you need a short book to read in between novels, I suggest this one. It's definately a change of pace from the other books I've read lately. Very endearing read. Hope you love it as much as I did!
B000MAH5O2|1.0|During the last four years the president and biographers have shown that this book is a work of historical fiction. Shouldn't it be categorized as such?
B008G33OJM|1.0|I was looking forward to this release but unfortunatly the Bluray discs that have been produced are defective. Many forums are discusing this and the Production company says they are working to rerelease the bluray version. When you start it up the Federal warning shows followed by some logos and a black screen that does not end. Buy the DVD version I have heard that one works.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|...but still an excellent book. I've been a mac user for years, and had heard that Jobs was prickly and demanding, but this book really gives insight into how much of a surly, abusive, possible schizophrenic this guy was. Oh, and he was a genius that conceived great products as well.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Soooo many characters it is hard to keep straight! Good story line all in all but a real let down ending!
B004RKXNDU|4.0|At the beginning I didn't quite get why this book had been recommended to me by a friend but it quickly made itself known. This is a quick moving spy thriller that is well worth the short time it will take you to read.
B0031Y9DCS|4.0|Good read about flying helicopters, the learning, flying in combat, fellow Warrant Officers. Information about life in Vietnam, living with death, in the mud and blood. As a Vietnam Vet myself I found it to be fun reading, and remembering the R&R's, life in a foreign country. The culture of Vietnam might interest younger readers.
B003Z2LAAO|5.0|This was the first 3D movie I viewed at home, and the experience was significantly better than any 3D IMAX or movie theater I've been to. (largely due to the videography of this film) The story can be rather dry at times, but the effects are excellent.
B008XG1X18|5.0|i really like everything about this app. it could be better though. i dont want to follow a person but maybe their board of specific pics. and maybe get to create pins on kindle fire and other tablets.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|great how you mix and match the sounds you like.<br /><br />Also like how you can adjust the volume for each sound individually the play them together.
B008XG1X18|5.0|At first I didn't think that I would like this new app but I have proven myself wrong. It's like a virtual scrapbook where I can track my many interests and likes. I espcially like saving the tips and tutorials that members provide. It has been a valuable tool for me and my DIY crafts and trying new things. I give it the highest rating possible.
B009EANE3M|5.0|I have loved The Script ever since I first heard their first single \\"Before The Worst\\" and I have been a dedicated fan. Science and Faith is an amazing album and I wasn't sure if #3 would be the same. It's amazing! It has shown how much the band has grown and matured. Success hasn't kept them from staying true to their sound. I haven't stopped listening and I am already anticipating album #4.

B007V65R54|5.0|Nate is the Elvis of prognosticators and modelers.  God bless him!  His book is the perfect antidote to the medieval mentality permeating the Right Wing of America.
B00846REIS|5.0|If you love Fifty shades of grey. you will love this book.  I actually like Eva over Ana anyway! I couldn't put it down!
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I found myself glued to this book.  I am a person that is very interested in technology and also, I am interested in studying people, from a psychological standpoint.  This book fit that bill for me.  The only downside is that it is a bit long.  I feel it could have been condensed a bit.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|This is a great Match 3 game.  The more you get into the game, the more challenging it becomes.<br /><br />I would recommend this game to everyone.
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I love SciFi movies and have probably seen every one made or at least a lot of them. This was one of the worst. I've seen SciFi movies made in the 40s/50s that were better than this one. It was obvious that Scott made this movie to capitalize on the success of Aliens. The movie is not well thought out, has ridiculous action sequences that make little to no sense. The movie was so bad that I now think Scott made it as a spoof of the Alien series. There are plenty of other reviews that detail all that is wrong with this movie.<br />If it made even the remotest sense, I would recommend it to those SciFi buffs that can overlook ridiculous actions by the crew but it doesn't. If you are totally bored, have nothing else to watch, like special effects just for the effects and can overlook anything, then you might consider wasting a couple dollars on this movie.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|It's acceptable to ask the audience to suspend disbelief about fantastic scenarios that excite them.<br />Unfortunately, the characters in this movie do STUPID things that go contrary to what you'd imagine their training to be.<br /><br />I can't say more without giving away spoilers.<br /><br />Of course it is a visually stunning movie BUT the story is a bit too clumsy to be worth more than 3 stars.
B004X6PRO6|4.0|The author's style and use of language is excellent.  I was particularly happy that for the most part he allowed me to figure out what the characters' thoughts and motivations were from the recital of their actions and conversations.  On the other hand, I found it difficult to know what part of the story (set in North Korea) had a basis in reality.  This confusion was sharpened by the introduction of a device called an \\"autopilot\\" that seemed to be past the leading edge of the most advanced current technology.  This led me to classify the book as science fiction; as an instance of this genre, I found it an enjoyable read with insights into current American politics, but as a plausible story of life in North Korea, I found it unconvincing.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The author's use of language is poetic. His descriptive sentences went beyond the mere telling of a story in that emotion is felt in every word.  I will certainly look for other books by this author.
B009HV2JT8|4.0|I only looked at this movie because I wondered how you could take such a great American hero and reduce him to some sort of \\"Twilight\\" nonsense. I've read a lot about Lincoln including a 45-hour book-on-tape on the Lincoln-Douglas debates. The brief scene with Steven Douglas is humorous. While nothing I've read would indicate Abe might have had a night job, he was known for being good with an ax (but not as good as in the movie). I watch \\"True Blood\\" and grew up on \\"Dark Shadows\\" so I like Vampire stuff. The whole Twilight thing makes me ill. This is much better, good action, good characters, good acting, good directing. While this may not go down in history as great cinema, it was entertaining and well done.
B0091REZMW|5.0|This is a really fun game.  The graphics are not bad at all and it will truely give you hours of fun. I would recommend this app.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|lots of fun. keeps you hooked with so many tasks to complete. I'm truely enjoying it! not keen on using. actual money to get money in the game. but there are ways around it!
B008UFUOH6|5.0|Tracey has a long and distinguished career, not only solo but also with Everything but the girl, although this is only the second album of her music that I've ever bought after [[ASIN:B000002LE7 Idlewild]]. (I must put that right someday.) I was surprised to learn about this album, but I expected it would be good, especially once I saw the track listing, which includes just one obvious classic, that being Have yourself a merry little Christmas. On the evidence of that track, if Tracey had filled the entire album, it would still have been a brilliant album (which I might have bought anyway), but I'm glad that she didn't do that. I love those classic songs, but I have plenty of versions of them already,<br /><br />Apart from Have yourself a merry little Christmas, two of the other songs are very familiar to me, although neither was originally meant to be a Christmas song. Hard candy Christmas, written by Carol Hall for Dolly Parton to sing in [[ASIN:B0000714BR The Best Little Chickenhouse in Texas]]. The song title is metaphorical; the song is not about Christmas, but that word being in the title is enough for it to be regarded as a Christmas song. Tracey's version is mellower than Dolly's version, and the slower tempo works well. Joni Mitchell's River is about a broken relationship around Christmas time. It's really about the feeling of loss rather than Christmas, but the song seems to be well on the way to becoming a Christmas standard.<br /><br />The other tracks feature songs written by people who you might recognize, depending on what music you're into. Randy Newman is the most famous of them; he wrote Snow, which I might have heard somewhere. Among the other writers are Ron Sexsmith (Maybe this Christmas), Jack White (In the cold, cold night) and Sufjan Stevens (Sister Winter).<br /><br />Tracey wrote two new songs, these being Joy (the opening track) and Tinsel and lights (the title track). The booklet provides the lyrics for these two, but not for the other songs. The title track is an uplifting song about a New York Christmas. At the time Tracey recorded the album in 2012, none of us could have imagined what misfortune would hit New York later that year, so this song has an unintended poignancy<br /><br />For those who enjoy mellow Christmas music avoiding most of the obvious songs, this may be just what you`re looking for. Merry Christmas everybody, especially New Yorkers....ngs. The title track is an uplifting song about a New York Christmas.

B007THA4FI|2.0|I was pretty bored. I just kept waiting for something to happen or even a hint that something exciting would happen. Things started to move at the end of the book, but it was too late. Bravo to the author for going a different direction, but Casual Vacancy didn't hit the mark for me.
1451620829|3.0|As far as rock autobiographies go, it is well written and full of dirt. I find it amusing that Pete seems to blame everyone but himself for his misfortunes. Yes, Paul and Gene underpaid him on the reunion tour(s), but from where he was, playing at dive bars, it represented a second chance at his floudering career and he blew it, again. There are many of us who would love to be paid $10K a gig while traveling in style.<br /><br />The drugs and alcohol issues of the 70's-80's ruined his career and let's face it, he was a better than average rock drummer at best. I also found it really amusing that he was shocked at this lack of success of his last solo record. Earth to Pete; it sucked.<br /><br />I could have done without the graphic sexual details.

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I like this portable app as I can use it anywhere at any time.

B001H4R4LQ|5.0|if you're into the Eragon books, you definitely want to read this as you finish up the series.<br />personally I think it moves a little slowly, but after finishing it I appreciated the laid back pace because it allowed for deep character and plot development -- something some series glaze over.<br /><br />I'm working on the last book (Inheritance) and I'm really glad I decided to finish this series after starting them so many years ago!
0345803485|5.0|AWESOME!  My friends and I had heard a lot about this set of books and wondered if it was going to be a racy as it was projected and like any other 50+ year olds we thought why not.<br />We all read and pass around our books (romance, historical, thrillers and biography's) so I ordered it and we have all enjoyed it.  I thought the books evolved into each other just like they should, they also told the story so you weren't left hanging at the end.<br />It was well written and our whole group have ventured on to others that were of the same nature.  I love to read just about anything so try to keep my mind open to all kinds of books, I'm glad I did as I really enjoyed these.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Book two was the best in this three book series. I loved it!!!!!!!!!! Book two had a great story line too.

B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book almost as much as the 50 shades trilogy.  Great story and lots of love and stuff!
B0000027I6|5.0|This is the most incredible recording I have ever heard. The entire album is as close to perfect I have ever heard. That is hard to do with Donald Fagen in the world, but Roger Waters' Amused to Death is just that incredible. Halographic audio gives an amazing 3d experience using 2 channel stereo. Incredible layering of sounds and musical instruments for all of the 74 minutes of the disk. Songs are great with the playing of Jeff Beck adding to it. Just awesome. I cannot say enough good about this incredible album. It must have taken years to get this masterpiece together.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|This may not be considered serious literature (which is not) but is really fun to read, and it is not just because of the sex scenes, which could be fewer. But the story is catchy, just like one of a favorite series or movie, and this is the fun of it. Love is always a catchy theme for a story.

That is the only thing I would like to have known before I purchased it...but I would have bought it anyway  I am in love with Jacob and Edward  and I am a GRANDMOTHER.!!!!!!!
B009KHBDUU|5.0|I thought this was a comedy but while it had some great comic lines throughout the movie, it was not really a comedy movie.  However, it was very enjoyable and all the actors did a great job.  If you enjoyed the TV series, I am sure you will enjoy this.  I did not ever see the TV series but still thought it worth watching.
076790592X|5.0|This book is about Morrie Schwartz, a sociology professor at Brandeis University in Waltham, MA. Mitch Albom, the author, is one of Morrie's students at Brandeis, who graduated in 1979. Morrie is like a father figure to Mitch and Mitch fondly calls his teacher, \\"Coach\\". On graduation day, Mitch promises Morrie that he will keep in touch with him but once he steps into the \\"real\\" world, he forgets all about his favorite professor.<br /><br />Mitch goes on to become a famous sports journalist and devotes his entire time to his work. Years later, one friday night in 1995, Mitch happens to watch ABC-TV's \\"Nightline\\" program by Ted Koppel and is dumbstruck to watch Morrie Schwartz being interviewed. Morrie is diagnosed with ALS - Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, an incurable fatal neuromuscular disease, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, in August 1994 and his condition deteriorates rapidly and is in a wheel chair for the interview.<br /><br />After the interview, Mitch goes to see Morrie(after 16 long years) and their last class together begins. Mitch meets Morrie every tuesday for several weeks and listens(Mitch records all of Morrie's talks on tape) to his professor discussing about the world, about feeling sorry for yourself, about regrets, about death, about family, about emotions, about the fear of aging, about money, about how love goes on, about marriage, about our culture, about forgiveness.<br /><br />These talks are filled with so much wisdom which we all do understand but, I guess, we never(have the time to) put into practice. This is what I have come away with after reading the book - be content, be grateful, give back to the society, appreciate the small things in life, understand your needs and wants, do not take your loved ones for granted, do something that will give you meaning and purpose and so on. But does one have to be suffering or dying to realize this? I don't think so.<br /><br />Mitch Albom's writing is uncomplicated and easy to read, this bookis a fast read but one that leaves a profound impact on the reader.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|It was action packed and the acting was good.  Enjoyed the ending as well.  If you like the Alien movies, you are sure to enjoy this one.  And since wasn't like the Alien movies as in always fighting off the ugly creature, if you didn't see any of the Alien movies, you will still enjoy this SciFi thriller.
B003UMW68Y|5.0|We recently visited Disneyland and the characters from this movie took over the Haunted Mansion which made us love the movie even more!!!

0307951529|5.0|I would really advice this peace of gold to everyone looking for being a entrepreneur, and don't have the background on business. It doesn't enter in detail about how to create a business, or the complexity of a startup, but from my point of view, it does at the core of being entrepreneur: it is not that difficult, lots of people are doing it, and it doesn't requiere being an MBA. It should be a must read even in universities that are not focused on business, like engineering.<br /><br />It is based on real stories of people starting self employment, and how from small ideas they could achieve a decent living being their own boss. It focuses on creating value and obtain profits from it. This book is not about how to build a startup like Cisco or Twitter, but how to demistify being a startup entrepreneur. On each chapter, the writer gives you priceless tips that maybe don't look like, but are really MBA tips.<br /><br />Just one small detail for the book writer. A startup, as we know it nowdays, is a technology company that can be scaled up worldwide without scaling up the team. For instance, Twitter or Cisco are startups. A technology consultant is not a startup.
1451695195|2.0|If you're looking for a book that tells a great deal about heaven as do books like \\"Heaven is For Real\\" by Todd Burpo or \\"90 Minutes in Heaven\\" by Don Piper, or \\"Flight to Heaven\\" by Cpt Dale Black, then \\"Proof of Heaven\\" is not the book for you. This is not to say that \\"Proof of Heaven\\" lacks interest or credibility but that it does not compare with the previously mentioned works when it comes to giving us information concerning heaven.. While the author claims to have gone deeper in experience than most others, if he has, he does not tell us much about it. Furthermore, unless you are knowledgeable in the field of the functioning of the brain and of brain surgery, this book will leave you scratching that part of your anatomy and wondering when is the author going to tell us more about heaven.<br /> The author also attempts to leave us an impressive index of  things written in his book and the works of others, but he fails to have included the best authorities such as Jesus Christ Himself. Jesus taught us more about heaven and how to get there than any other person. The author also quotes others who have made the NDE trip but fails to tell the reader of Apostle Paul's journey in to heaven as described briefly in 2 Corinthians 12:1-4. That visit likely occurred the time reported in  Acts 14:19 where the Apostle was attacked in Asia Minor, dragged out of the city and left for dead.<br /> In writing this review I am in no way panning Dr. Alexander's book but since I bought it on the basis of the written reviews, it is only fair to include mine as well.

B005IGDW24|1.0|I understand the blu-ray industry is just trying to protect against piracy, but all they suceed in doing is alienating legitimate consumers like myself.  I actually purchased this movie and because my 3d projector uses an analog VGA display input I cannot watch this movie at all.  My power dvd comes up and says my tv must have a digital input like dvi, hdmi, or display port.  If this is the future of digital high definition video then I'm just going to start pirating all my HD video's rather than purchasing them legitimately.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is disgusting to put it simply. It's a ripped off idea from Twilight (Edward anyone?) and it has in fact been proven that the author originally wrote a Twilight fan fiction and changed a few names around and made it her own. It's disgusting and I can't believe so many people enjoy it. I think that all the bored soccer moms and girls trying to get new ideas to please their men need to look elsewhere. As stated in other reviews, if you took at Ana biting her lip and acting like a complete friggen dumbass, the book would be a lot shorter. The beginning plot line isn't bad, where she goes to do an interview in place of her sick friend, after that first meeting, the book goes to hell. I don't recommend it at all unless you like trash.
B00886XQO0|5.0|I received these headphones in good shape.  I have been using them for about 30 hours and have had no issues.  They are much more comfortable than the XP 500s.  Also, there is absolutely no cracking of connection and in fact I was able to wear the headphones and still talk and hear game play while two rooms away from the receiver, still no crackiling or cutting out.<br /><br />Voice is clear and concise and I was able to hear my music through BT while playing without any problems.  This is a expensive headset, but extremely worth it.  I have not tried voice morphing or manipulating any of the sound functions through the computer.<br /><br />Pros:<br />Sounds Quality<br />Presets<br />Range<br />Voice Quality<br />Comfortable (caveat: ears were sore after 8 hrs of straight game play, but any headset would be at that point)<br />Detachable mic<br />rechargeable battery<br />battery life<br /><br />Con(s):<br />Price- definitely takes a while to save up for them<br />lack of carrying case<br />Warm around the ears<br />top of the head can get sore from the weight<br /><br />***Update 8 NOv 2012***<br />Was able to chat with the wife while gaming.  I was interested to see if the voice morph would work just with regular cell phone usage.  It did and it was pretty damn funny, think it was preset 8...start laughing and it gets the creepy demon like laugh.  Wife didn't care for it too much though :)<br /><br />Bummed...order this early and pay 299.99, now it is 269.99.

B007IXWKUK|4.0|After feeling a little disappointed with this trilogy's somewhat awkward and amateurish first installment, things really started taking off in this second book....more answers provided, more involving sub-plots and characters, still seductive - it was a far more interesting and developed read. I couldn't flip pages fast enough and read it in record time. Glad I didn't give up after the first volume.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Great story line. John Corey at his best. Real nice touch bringing Brenner into the mix.<br />Good mix of characters and bad actors.
B008MEM24S|4.0|This game is great for the little ones and a good game that can be played along with them. My nieces and nephews love the problem solving aspect and the graphics are cool. The puzzle aspect makes them think outside the box (and me too). Its a game that provides fun for all.

0525953728|5.0|The book is a good read, however raises questions. When they were sent on raid, instructions were vague, at best. Theyn said if Bin Laden didn'tfight, don't shoot. then said they weren't telling them how to do the job, which leaves it as clear as mud.<br /><br />The rules of engagement over there are, if they don't have a weapon or act hostile don't shoot.<br /><br />The first two they met on the raid either shot at them or tried, and were taken out.<br /><br />On Bin Laden's son, they called his name and he stuck his head out the door to see who called him and was shot, like calling a turkey and shooting him whie he is not looking. He didn't have a gun on him, but there was one in the room, but they couldn't see it.<br /><br />On Bin Laden he just stuck his head out of the room to see what was going on and was shot. They had to search to find  guns, and they were not loaded.<br /><br />Both these two shootings to me were a violation of the rules of engagement as stated, or were there orders given that were given but not reported.<br /><br />I beleive the seals were set up in case farther down the line if someone decides they should be charged, they won't have any thing to back them up, and I am sure they are under some threat that if any one tells, it will affect the entire seal program.<br />If it were just one person they would tell but if it might be bad for the entire program they won't, like threating to disband the seal rogram<br /><br />After all, we captured Saddam alive and he was armed, but that was under President George Bush
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this! you never get tired of this app! there are so many games you and your kids will love and can play together!
B009AMAKJU|5.0|The movie is never the same as the book, and there were little things that I kept wanting to see in the movie that were missing; but overall, it was fantastic.  I love watching movies that the author had a lot of involvement in to see how their vision translates to the screen.  The screenplay was written by the author and the author directed it as well.  The actors were fantastic, and I fell in love with all of them all over again.  Fair warning, it's a fairly emotional movie...you may even need a tissue.
B008N1V11U|3.0|several times the app would crash and when I restart I would lose the use of any gadgets I had except for the batarangs.<br />They would still have the skill points I assigned but I couldn't choose them.<br />In other words if I could have 12 smokebombs and have skill points assigned but after the app crash I would have to purchase the Skill Reset option and redistribute the points so I could use my gadgets again.  I had to do this 3 times in order to finish. Its extremely annoying to spend hours earning these points to unlock gadgets, only to lost them over and over.<br /><br />If it wasn't for that then I'd be very happy with this game. I was surprised on how much fun and how excellent it was to play.

B0083P1QUM|2.0|I have to say this was one of the least enjoyable books by Cornwell that I've read. It was slow, tedious and boring. I kept waiting for something to happen. I have read all her books and generally love them. Not this time!!
B004ZY0VHY|3.0|Good things about the novel:  This novel really explores well the mystery of the interior life of parents of Columbine-type school shooters.  How much did they suspect their kids were capable of mass murder?  Were the kids born sociopaths or did their parents mess them up?  Can you continue to  love and support a kid like that?  Where does the anger come from?<br /><br />Bad things about the novel:  The main character is supposedly from Racine, Wisconsin, but the voice could be Lady Mary from Downton Abbey.  I couldn't get past the British clip of her writing.  (The author is American, but lives in London.) The British tone may be on purpose because the character is a self-loathing American, but it's still annoying and distracting. Also, I agree that it's way too long.  There are all sorts of musings included in the letters of the main character that I just skimmed over in search of interesting and relevant parts. There were also some weird under-developed plot issues... Reaction to prozac?  Where did that come from?<br /><br />Nevertheless, I would recommend the novel for anyone interested in the nature/nurture issue, the psychology of school shooters and their parents,  or looking for an absorbing read on a long flight.
B00000427L|1.0|Album came in good time but although album states 2 CD there is only  one inside.  I bought album to give as part of a birthday<br />gift for my daughter and it was not opened until after Amazon return date.  I contacted seller but have received no communication or action on their part.  CD 1 is beautiful and would love to have received complete album.  Buyer beware !!<br />Check your purchase immediately.
B009GN6DT4|5.0|This is such a sweet & funny movie. I hadn't seen it since it came out 30 years ago in the theater. I really enjoyed the entire film. :)
B006LSZECO|5.0|Whether you love or hate Nancy Grace and all the other shows that delve into missing people and murders then you'll love this book!<br /><br />Gilliam Flynn expertly writes in three different voices.  One view from the diary of the missing wife, Amy, another view in Amy's \\"live\\" voice, and the view of the husband.<br /><br />Throughout the novel these points of view are woven into a believable story of what happens when boy meets girl and they play the mating game.  What happens when the marriage falls apart and if anyone can survive it.<br /><br />Love this book!  I couldn't put and down and didn't want it to end.  It is one of those rare books that will stick with you long after you've finished it.
B008ASLK8A|1.0|This movie is just an excuse for needless violence. Where is Sherlock's skill as a brilliant sleuth? I'll stick with Jeremy Brett!
B00932ANQM|3.0|Not terrible but pretty cliche. Not a strong performance by Zach Effon.  The war scenes were done very well-too bad the rest of the movie was not as captivating.
B0076DCT2G|3.0|At about 90% on Kindle, a little action began but did not lead to an exciting climax, just came to an end.  Sort of like bad sex.
B000VMFDW2|5.0|OK, I read this book after seeing \\"The Pacific\\".  I loved it.  It was great and gave me a better understanding and appreciation for the earlier generations of Service Members.  This was the first military historical book I have read and it really opened doors for me to other stories of personal accounts of wars.  This is a great read.
B007THA4FI|4.0|Let me emphasize THIS IS NOT AN EASY READ. I had moments when I didn't want to pick it up. But it is rewarding if you finish it. I'm sure that I will find many reviews of people complaining about every aspect of this book simply because it is NOT Harry Potter. Others will complain because of the language, the grim realities of these character's lives and the drug use. Surely those people have watched an R-rated movie before.<br /><br />In my opinion this book was great. It was real. Real life isn't neat, PG-rated, loose endings don't tie up in nice little bows. People are hypocrites, junkies, heroes. People are flawed and some never learn or change, they remain in horrible relationships or refuse to get off drugs. Others succeed against the odds, show kindness and try to live their lives to make the lives of others better. Some kids are bullies and cowards, others are couragous when least expected. This intricate fabric is what JK Rowling portrays very effectively in her novel.<br /><br />It IS hard to read. It IS at times depressing. But it's honest and there is beauty even in the tragic aspects of the book. One must have patience to read this book, one cannot want the easy narrative or solution. The only reason I took off a star is because I felt it took her a little long to get past introducing all her characters. I also felt that the POV was a bit jarring, as it switches very often from one character to the next. I'll say this though, I don't think very many authors could pull off this narrating style.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|If the author uses the image of Ana biting her lip just one more time, I think I will spontaneously combust.  OKAY, we get it, biting her lip drives him crazy. ARGH. It does NOT need to be repeated in each chapter. The rest of the book is kinda boring, actually, and the whole premise of their relationship is just so unbelievable, you keep reading just to see if either of these people have any redeeming qualities or if anything is going to happen. Keep reading. It doesn't.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Read it twice!! Couldn't put it down. Kept your attention. Great love story, can't wait for the next one to come out!!

B006QS07IK|5.0|This classic horror tale has, a bit surprisingly, its greatest horrors as horrors of the mind.  To be sure, there are some horrible events, but the most severe horrors are those that transpire within the minds of  Victor Frankenstein, and again surprisingly, to his creation, also referred to as his monster or daemon.  The story is well known.  An excited young Frankenstein believes he has deduced the means to create life.  Shelley is mercifully scant with the details of his collecting parts and induing (a word Shelley likes and uses more than once) life.  The tale is told by a sea captain in the Arctic Ocean, recorded as Frankenstein told it to him.  As a young man, Frankenstein himself has a sharp mind and a positive spirit, and a family that's brought him up in a serene Geneva environment.  The gist of the story is the excitement leading to Frankenstein's creation, and the sequelae of that action.  The creation is not initially a brute.  An intrinsic part of the story is how he becomes one.  Influencing that transition strongly is the effect of rejection and isolation based only on external appearance.  Also intrinsic is the effect this creation has on its creator.  Both Frankenstein and the monster face issues of sanity, both of them losing it to one degree or another as the book progresses.  The details are yours to read.  The writing is lovely and clear to the modern reader.  Issues involved in the story include the causes and effects of being socially isolated, the responsibilities a creator has to his creation and society, particularly when those responsibilities conflict, and to what degree one is bound by one's commitment in the face of uncertainty about it.  In some ways, the relationship between Frankenstein and his creation changes over time, becoming almost synergistic or symbiotic.  Well sequenced, clearly told, and provoking strong emotion in the reader to go with strong emotion in the characters, most often Frankenstein, but also the monster.  Brilliant and worthy of its status as a classic.ant and worthy of its status as a classic.
B009329ZF2|5.0|If you Like Navy Battle? this Movie is for you... great effects, excellet definition, Sound to envolving your world in a complete WAR... I recomended 10000000%

B004RKXNDU|5.0|Excellent. Superb. This IS NOT a shoot-em-up spy story. Le Carre cleverly lets us know what it's like to be a spy by purposely keeping us in the dark and leading readers into a confusing web of lies and intrigue that seems impossible to untangle.
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is awesome. Great graphics. Believe. me when I like a game it is a good game. People call Mr the game reveiwer
B0091QWFUM|5.0|I am reviewing the Blu-Ray version of this disc - my copy says \\"made in the EU\\" but plays fine on my US blue ray player (i'm not sure if there will be a proper US Release on this title).  The total running time on the BR disc is around 3 hours.  95 min or so for the O2 concert, and an hour and a half of bonus/extras.  The O2 concert is quite good, in hi-def with a decent sound mix; the \\"Ride the Tiger\\" string-together of videos is in hi-def but only 2.0 sound; the intimate club show is in 2.0 but not high-def (but, is very good nonetheless as it is mostly Oasis tunes) and the NME Show is around 25 min in Hi-def picture, with 2.0 sound.  Most of the key cuts from the NG/HFB album are in the main program, along with some new tunes and some Oasis songs.  I had seen NG/HFB do a 35 minute set at the KROQ Christmas show in 2011 here in LA, and they were very impressive, thus spurring my purchase of this full-length show blu-ray.  I am of the opinion that the Noel-solo album is one of the better things he's done, so i'm very happy to have this show on disc.  There is an additional (CD) disc of stripped down demos of the NG/HFB album (in same order as the actual, plus some extra cuts) included in the blu-ray package i have, so despite the price, you do get quite a bit in the package.
0399157565|5.0|This is a great book...kept me guessing until the end!  I am really looking forward to the next Scarpetta Novel.
B003VWU2WA|5.0|I bought this for a single purpose and I have found it to be a very handy item.  So now I use it for a lot of applications.  The setup is very easy and the fact that the functions can be set differently for each application, and switch automatically is great.  It seems very sturdy.  I love it.
B001DSNF8C|5.0|Best blending of James Bond of the novels with what would or could become Sean Connery's Bond. Royale is Bond before. Before the humor, confidence, polished style and boyish charm of the first Connery movies is the hard edged Daniel Craig, Bond of Casino Royale.<br /><br />This movie takes a \\"Doctor Who\\" time space jump and brings us a perfect Bond film full of firsts. First love, first 00 mission, first upgrade of dinner jackets, first friendships and first defining torture and Bond's foundations have been set. This is the ground all other Bonds stand on. This is the man who has discovered who he is, which is to say, Bond, James Bond.<br /><br />  Sharpen these images with Blu-ray and special features and enjoy like never before.
B005EGXTEE|2.0|Easy to read  will probably read the others, but a bit like Hp in style if not content. Where is twist that stops the reader in his tracks and makes him re think? . I truly hope the rest of the trilogy  has more to offer
B005I2KDR0|5.0|When I get it seems better that on pictures, more need functions that help in work and life, if you deside buy or not I say that buy! Before it I used Casio, thats REAL CHINA but they works 2-years.
B003K16PFU|3.0|I liked this book, but it did drag on in the middle.  I hoped for more about Catalonia, but this book is really about war. I'm glad I read it, but it just wasn't what I expected.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This app is easy to use and is very convenient for me. It is really really nice for a free app.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is really a relaxing and enjoyable game for building a frontier town. I'm addicted, and hope they keep the updates to it coming. Thank you for a fun game for my Kindle.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I liked The Bone Bed more than I have liked Patricia Cornwell's books in the past years, but it is still not as good as the eaerlier Scarpetta books. It's too bad that Scarpetta seems destined for an unhappy personal life.  How could she have made so many enemies during her life.  Someone is always out to get her, to make her look bad and unprofessional.  As much as I love science, there is more than I want to know in this book.  For those who are looking for all the real life reasons behind the evidence, this might be for you.  If you have been a long-time fan of Cornwell's books, you should include this one in your collection.
B005WUHAX8|4.0|after all the hype about this case i would b disappointed if i had paid full price for it, its hard to get on and get off of your phone and need and adapter for some chargers to fit in the small opening, but with that said i guess it works well
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Easy to use and has all the looks of the classic Mahjong game. The screen is clear, legible and the colors are vibrant.
B008MEM24S|5.0|My 5 year old son loves this game and I think it is a lot of fun as well.  This is a great example of Disney really getting a game right.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Another well written book.  Detailed events and recalling the past so you are always in the loop.  I've always enjoyed Rick's writing and cannot wait for the rest of the series.  Rick's writing style is great, I love how he dedicates each Chapter to a character which builds the story.  This story is imaginable with facts to back up the plot.  I really couldn't put the book down.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This was a terrific read.  I could hardly put it down. It was extremely timely in its release during the Benghazi debacle, and it's plot is both timely and not entirely fantasy, but definitely plausible.  Thanks for a great read!!
B00136Q75M|5.0|The Offspring was criticized for switching record companies at this time, but this album has just as many of my favorite Offspring songs as any of their other albums. Favorites on this album: The Meaning Of Life, I Choose, All I Want, Way Down The Line. (No particular order) And the rest are pretty good too.
B0098VXE50|4.0|Wow! Don't expect to see the lovable dwarfs hugging Snow White as they skip  off to work singing Hi - Ho!..Hi-Ho!  No -No!  These dwarfs are rough and ready guys however, they manage to remain lovable.<br />  A little on the dark side \\" Snow White & the Huntsman \\" is entertaining , engaging , suspenseful and exciting  with remarkable special effects and good<br />performances by Snow White , the Huntsman and the evil , vengeful Step Mother !!<br /> And yes , there is a part for the juicy , desirable Red Apple!<br />  A nice addition to our Amazon movie collection.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Love the app, but I wish it had the NRSV translation. It has had a large impact on my study of the Bible.
B007QPFGJW|2.0|Read all his other books and really liked them, this one I didn't even finish.  Did not hold my interest at all.
B005CFWNPI|5.0|I've had them for just about 3 weeks and they great!!!  They look cool and feel cool.  Wish they had a little more heel but still, I would buy again.  I have over 6 different Crocs and have never had a problem.  I suffer from plantar fasciitis and these are the best shoes.  No pain when walking.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I have been searching for a good fantasy book for a long time. I have found a few that were o.k. But nothing that really wowwed me until I found this book. Awesome. Cant wait for the next book  in the series.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I liked it it was raw but I felt the story in 1 was way better. I knew he killed him but I would've liked a confrontation with Eva and her demon. Plus Gideon's character gets lost sometimes. He needs to be more invovled that mysterious thing only lasts so long. Secretly I want Eva with Cary he sounds better for her. But I still loved the book cant wait for number 3
B006VGGAC4|3.0|I admire Arnold greatly. Anyone that can determine a goal and pursue it as he did is impressive. It is an interesting read.
B0053TMP24|5.0|loved it so much that I read all the books, I read Percy Jackson series,The heroes of Olympus & The Kane chronicles, & I love how you use Greek mythology,Roman mythology,& Egyptian mythology.
B002RI9HUM|4.0|A fast easy read,  that keeps you interested till the last page. Not too soppy or sentimental. A good weekend read!!
B0083P1QUM|4.0|Great book and typical Kay Scarpetta.  Cornwell never fails to deliver the product. Looking forward to the next installment in the series.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|This is good, as are all of Nelson DeMille's books.  John Corey is back, along with Brenner from the General's Daugher. A good book!!
B003EI2EH2|5.0|It's a great book. The research about the subjects is very thorough and the author is crazy enought to test the ideas by himself! The reader should nevertheless be very careful when applying any of the concepts. I really recommend it to anyone who aims to deeply understand the how's and why's of the human body.
0307352145|4.0|My favorite part of Quiet is that it gives permission for us introverts to stop trying so hard at being outgoing, more so than we naturally are, and instead unapologetically embrace the inner life.<br /><br />The portion of the subtitle which says \\"...in a world that can't stop talking,\\" --that really hit home for me. Quite often I feel there's too much day-to-day noise to work through, and this book is a convincing reinforcement to seek those quieter moments.
B0099G6Q5E|4.0|I really enjoyed the movie and bought the soundtrack immediately afterward on my phone. It's a fun soundtrack and has all the songs I wanted to hear again from the movie.
B009NQKXYK|5.0|Dark and suspenseful, very good! They did the Alien series proud with this prequel. Great story and action packed movie.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|This cd makes me smile! Makes me feel like I've come home. I look forward to another release. If you like their videos then you will like their cd.
B004BGH8ZO|5.0|Love it. Every song is good. I especially love Van Nuys & Courtesy Call. A great musical depiction of what he went through. I also have \\"This is Gonna Hurt\\" which is equally fantastic.
0156027321|5.0|This book was purchased for our book club.  Although we found it a bizarre story, it gave us much material for discussion.
B004ZY0VHY|5.0|This book stayed with me wherever I went, I thought about it all the time! I had already seen the film, so knew what was coming, but still found the writing so compelling and the story so deep I was fascinated.<br />Above all, the writing was just great, I reread passages just to enjoy the prose.The authors use of language combined with such a harrowing and ambivalent story was wonderful.
B0094M2O7C|5.0|While there were times the movie seemed weak, on a whole it was excellent. I enjoyed watching it the first time, and that joy was streghtened by the second and third time as I watched and saw things missed during first viewing, as is often the case.<br /><br />I'd HIGHLY recommend the movie.
034580404X|1.0|This book is basically porno in print.  I became extremely bored by the second chapter.  I prefer books that I read have a plot and be realistic.  This book did neither.  I purchased the trilogy and have no desire to read II and III.
B008GVD6D8|5.0|this book was a great read i couldnt put it down i had to finish it in one night cant wait till 31st december for part three
B008JMKN4Y|4.0|I really loved this book. I loved reading Travis and Abby's crazy messed up love story. The only reason I gave this book 4 stars was because I wasn't a big fan of the nickname Pigeon. I can't wait to read the second book in Travis' point of view.
030758836X|4.0|Hard-to-put-down type of book on a couple of white trash.  Just brilliant.<br /><br />Really enjoyable.<br /><br />The \\"acknowledgements\\" of the author, thanking her husband, at the end of the book seems to have been written by Amy
B007Z8ZKS2|5.0|I volunteer at the Schneider Children's Hospital in Israel the terminal Oncology ward and purchased this book for our teenagers. Even though I shed a few tears while reading this book I also laughed, a lot. The kids know how to live with their cancer and this book shows it is true. When my son was diagnosed with cancer I told him we Will learn to live with it the best we can there were tears but also lots of laughter. I loved it because it is true to life but not morbid. Good work John Green and thanks.
B0053O89WY|5.0|What can I say but this season was great. It was fun to see the characters grow our of their comfort zones!! Imagine it Shelton has a girlfriend! They are all nuts but I am sick of Leonard and Penny's relationship.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|I just read Escape from Camp 14.  This book will open the eyes of many to the horrific treatment of humans in this world.<br />What this young man endured is beyond what the human mind can imagine.<br />I applaud his bravery, determination and inner strength.<br />Could not stop reading!
B007OWRBJK|4.0|I did enjoy this book, I have been a Who fan since the beginning.  I saw them in concert several times.  My only complaint is Pete seems to get into a pity party for himself several times throughout the book.  Come on, he's one of the top rock stars in the world, has made tons of money but it doesn't seem enough.  The sadness of the talented.
B00005JNJV|5.0|To say that Batman Begins is my least favorite of the Nolan Bat-trilogy is sort of like saying that the missionary position is my least favorite way of having sex.<br /><br />\\"Training is nothing - will is everything!\\"
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Martin continues to amaze with this second installment to the series. Riveting storytelling and lush characterization are staples in all of Martin's work and this one is no exception.
B00005JKCH|3.0|In 2002 I remember having my breath taken away at the theatre, all the while quelling rage at the guy snickering a row behind me.<br /><br />Well... ten years later, there is much to snicker at in this film.<br /><br />However, one cannot divorce that from the contribution it had at the time - not the least of which was bringing the wall-crawler to life visually, in a stunning fashion.<br /><br />But the story itself is... well, silly.  The Green Goblin's motivation is questionable at best, though the strength of Dafoe's performance helps cover this up.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|This cable works fine....the test will be in 3 yrs whether the casing flakes away as the old one did.

B004SIIBGU|3.0|Just got it but I think it will serve the purpose of tracking my ebay purchases. It should make using ebay a lot faster for the items I need and want.
B002A4F6JE|5.0|This was one of the best series I have watched in a long time. The best way to watch a series like this is one behind the other. I don't know how people waited a week for the next episode. Well worth the money!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book. I hope they make it into a movie. Story like is  great. I wish there was more books in this series.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Kept up with the suspense can't wait for the 3rd. Great book i recommended it. Her other books are good too if your looking for something new to read.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Enjoyed this book.  Great love story and alot of poetry.  Definitely a different take and that was refreshing!  Read the sequel great end to a great love story!
B008GVD6D8|4.0|Loved bared to you and just had to get this book. Read them both in 2 days - I just couldn't put it down! Can't wait for the release of the next one and see what is in store for Gideon and Eva!
B0068LYEHA|1.0|Crude, not really funny,centers almost entirely on sex.  Not what I expected.  There are many other ways to be a woman than to focus on sex alone.
B0068THAGY|3.0|This is a feel good movie.  Truthfully I almost turned it off at the beginning, but 15 minutes in and I was into it.  Brings you back to your childhood.
B005LAII3U|1.0|I was excited to see a remake of the old Total Recall, which I fully enjoyed at the time. Of course, I started being worried when I saw that Collin Farrel was starring in it, as he has an habit of acting in massive flops...<br /><br />Unfortunately, my gut feel got proven right. While I believe that anybody who has not seen the 90's version might find this movie entertaining, it remains very flat.<br /><br />Do not get me wrong, I am not one of these nostalgic people who simply believe that \\"it was better before\\", and I am sure the old movie has aged poorly, but I have to say that in this case, I can only miss the humour, the 2nd degree of the previous movie...<br /><br />This one is just a simple entertainment: no emotion, difficult to get attached to any character... It even gets difficult to care whether you are in a dream or not !<br /><br />So, yes, very poor indeed...
B006G3MZRQ|4.0|I loved this movie.  Now I know some will say that it is unrealistic and all I can say is its a movie.  If we wanted reality we would watch a documentary.  This is pure entertainment.  Watch for yourself and you decide.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I first saw Prometheus in a 3D IMAX Theater.  The entire experience was sensory overload.  The sound and visual effects are fantastic and there are several scenes where you're picking your jaw off the floor or covering your eyes<br /><br />Prometheus is an amazing movie.  Before seeing it I had been told it was an Alien prequel ... that it explained part of the Alien Saga.  Even without the ties (although you barely notice its related to the Alien movies until basically the end) to the Alien movies, Prometheus stands on its own as a fantastic Sci Fi adventure.  Great story and plot with many underlying tones, Great cast if characters, effects, sound, set pieces, suspense, excitement, and some pretty gory moments all wrap up into one awesome time!<br /><br />The Blu Ray is great.  Looks stunning.  Crystal Clear.  The 3D is also very good.  I was surprised how well the 3D played out at home.  So far Prometheuse is one of the best 3D movies I've watched at home (And definitely the best live action one, most of the best 3D movies I've watched at home have been animated movies).<br /><br />Bottom line ... if you love action and/or sci fi, Prometheus is for you.  Would also be a great gift for someone too!<br /><br />Cheers!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I've read this book twice.  Excellent character development and story line.  Great depth to the back story.  I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys Tolkien.
0393339882|5.0|Kumar's masterstroke is giving us just enough information to understand each significant discovery as it occurs. First we see quanta in energy, then the photoelectric effect, then the evolution of the concept of the atom. Kumar expertly balances descriptions of experiments and challenges to conventional thinking with the payoff of new ideas, generating suspense and wonder in equal measure.<br /><br />This eminently readable book also reminds us that even geniuses can be trapped by their own ideas. In tracing the development of quantum theory, we see great physicists fail to accept the evidence for everything from atoms to electrons to the probability clouds of quantum theory. For instance, the great experimentalist Max Planck, who first quantized energy when studying blackbody radiation, was never able to fully accept the implications of his discovery - and this despite the equation flying in the face of all established  \\"truth\\" up to that point.<br /><br />So we can forgive Einstein for never being able to accept quantum theory (despite his contributions via the photoelectric effect). Maybe it was because he was a theorist rather than an experimentalist, and quantum theory at the time did not easily lend itself to top-down theorizing. Maybe it was because he was old. He certainly didn't like the look of all those probability clouds. In any event, Kumar's description of his thought experiment that (temporally) rocked Bohr and the experiment's surprise resolution is pure gold - and one of the book's great payoffs. Highly recommended.
B0076DCT2G|1.0|\\"has there ever been so much written about so little\\"? I have been a fan of DeMille since his first books and all have been great (\\"UP Country\\" was two thirds travelogue, but that was okay with me because of my service during the Vietnam era). Even John Corey has been good, but with this book, after 50 pages I wanted someone to shoot John Corey so we would not have to read another cynical, sarcastic line. But no, we must go on for hundreds of pages to cover a very small and obvious plot, with an ending to allow for more of the same. Please give it up, Mr. DeMille
B00003CXBK|4.0|The Gods are not dead. They live. But they are not alone. Demon-Gods live too. And they do battle against the Gods. Studio Ghibli's Princess Mononoke (Princess Monster), now the 11th consecutive SG film that I have watched. Once Japan was densely covered with forests. But now many of them are gone as humans continue to expand and cut down the trees. Far in the East, there live the Emishi. Here, a young prince is attacked by a Demon-God. The film is about Prince Ashitaka's quest to recover from the poison inflicted on him as he killed a Demon-God. Journeying far to the West, to an ancient forest (modeled on Yakushima), Ashitaka finds himself caught in the struggle between the representatives of the forest and the men and women of Tataraba (Iron Town). Ashitaka represents balance and a way forward for both the forest denizens and for the people of Tataraba. But will they be able to move forward without killing each other first?<br /><br />Princess Mononoke is one of the more famous Studio Ghibli films. And rightfully so. The tale is epic and the animation is beautiful. And though I liked the film, I think I still prefer some earlier SG films like My Neighbor Totoro, and some of the later films like Spirited Away and Ponyo. Something about this particular film dragged a little bit too much.

B004H4XL7E|5.0|A lot of books have been written about presenting and communicating, but very few give you the simple process for consistent success like Pitch Anything. I had just prepared a 3 hour lecture on cross-cultural communications as I was reading this book and ended up changing the entire lecture the night before because of what I learned in Pitch Anything. I'm glad I did because I was able to gain, hold onto and focus the audience's attention for the entire 3 hours. Awesome. Pitch Anything has also helped in my presentations training programs and in my meetings with clients. It's really opened my eyes to a new way of communicating with people and getting my message across. Like I said, it's game changing. Thanks Oren!
B009NQKXYK|3.0|It is a good movie, but much more alien - like than I would have expected, ...  Some nice special effects, and of course all set for a sequel
B003O86FMW|4.0|True to the first, the second boon was equally empowering! Ever second of reading had me on the edge of my seat, waiting to see what would happen next. The ending was truly unexpected! Incredible!

044024630X|4.0|I have enjoyed all of the Jack Reacher books including this one but I did feel that the outcome was a bit more predicatable than Lee Child's prior works. Maybe it was because the options in this story were fewer than previous reads but early on I was left toggling between two individuals behind the crimes. In this case my level of certainty was about 80% as to who it was....A very high number for a normal Jack Reacher book. The story did provide some good background in understanding the details about Reacher's separation from the military and as to why he acts like he does. This was still a very interesting and entertaining read and I would recommend it. The book also included a short story called \\"Second Son\\" that goes even further back to Reacher's teen years as a Marine brat that provides more insight into his family, his upbringing and the routine he would repeat as he moved from base to base.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Enjoyed the second cross book .  Can't hardly wait for the next one.  I wish it was coming out before may!!!!
B009MCRHH6|5.0|This game has great art, sound, and, mechanics compared to normal app store games.  It was originally a $20 pc game that won numerous awards so its a steal for $5 and also has a much higher production value then any app.  Just buy it!
B004V5A7K8|4.0|This is really a good rendering of the classic breakout game that we all know of in the early Atari days! and other ported versions on the PC. The game installed perfectly on my Kindle fire and Samsung Tablet and it was an nostalgic experience for me. I loved this game as a teenager and even today I love to play this game over and over again. Endless challenge and fun.<br /><br />The Blocks classic games control work perfectly and if you are into serious game-play I suggest you use a stylus for better control as your fingers can get all sweaty as you progress into higher levels.<br /><br />Perfect game, Highly addictive. No permission issues. Worth even penny. Four stars!
B0052RDHTM|4.0|This was a great read.  I just finished and read reviews for 2nd book - WINTER OF THE WORLD.  I am waiting for the KINDLE price of $19.99 to become more budget friendly and will definitely read 2nd book - no matter the reviews.  I have to know what happens to all the characters.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|It kept me guessing about who might be involved in the conspiracy. I suspected almost everyone, except of course, Jack Reacher. Kept me reading late into the night. My first Jack Reacher novel, not my last.
B007EECSFA|5.0|My favorite Kate Morton book yet.  Great story. Surprising ending. Kept you guessing until the end.  Very enjoyable to read. I hope she comes out with more. One of my favorite authors.
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a very complete report on weather conditions and seems pretty accurate as well.  I like that I can easily check the conditions where I am and where I am going, and even the kind of weather my family are enjoying (or NOT!)  I would reccommend it to anyone that wants an app that updates often and is an accurate forcast of what is and will be.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|It is a simple app but it works well.  I can easily browse files down to whatever level I want, which is important if you want to find the items that are taking up a lot of space on your device.

B0085MNZ66|2.0|I didn't really like this item called pigment.  If you like strategy games; then maybe you might like this game. You have to figure out which color it will change into when it crosses paths with a different color so I got confused and bored easily.
1400067820|4.0|Antifragile covers a deep subject that applies to us all, in every facet of our lives - from health and education to career and relationships to politics and the economy. Yet it reads clearly, and includes a lot of fun stories and examples. It gets to the heart of what's wrong with our current society, and how to fix it. Readers who like [[ASIN:1590304675 Ken Wilber]] or [[ASIN:B0042XA2XG Steven Pinker]] will love Antifragile.<br /><br />The main point is that the way the professions in our modern world run society is creating a more fragile world and citizenry. The experts, in short, are making most of us weaker and more dependent. And the government is helping it all right along. In fact, most of us are (unknowingly, unwittingly) supporting this weakening of our societies and nations.<br /><br />This book is a must-read. Deep, profound, fun; really enjoyable.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|Read it and enjoy. Beautiful prospective on life, happiness and love. It is also an interesting read on why we think the way we do about ourselves and others.  Really fascinating.

B00957T6X6|5.0|Fire and Ice, A Game of Thrones is  of the a must-read for the serious reader.  The author takes you into a world where you are a part of the story, feeling the hopes and disappointments of each character.  One learns what it is to love, feel betrayal and build one's hopes for a better future.  The story is honest, graphic and provides events that can surprise the reader.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|After reading 5000+ pages of these characters I was highly disappointed in the ending of this book until I found out there were other books in the works.  I purposely waited to read this series until I thought the last book was published but I was surprised.  Now I am waiting along with untold amounts of people for the continuing saga.  I was missing the stories of Bran, Rickon and Jaime and Brianne.  I am a little tired of evil always winning out and would like to see a few of these characters put in their place, Hello Cersei, for a little bit longer.
1401324649|3.0|I enjoyed the book for the most part, but found myself wishing for it to end before I finished it as it grew to be beyond absurd. The best part was the character, Allan Karlsson, who was able to walk throughout history remaining neutral in the midst of major political turmoil There were moments when I laughed at the humor, but it was about 100 pages too long.

B00633PFQC|5.0|Sandel knows his classical market theory (Locke, Mill, Adam Smith) and contemporary exponents such as Gary Becker.  Can argue back and forth on whether activities such as carbon exchanges or buying the right to have another child in China is unfair to the economically disadvantaged or corrupts childbearing.<br />Glad I read it

B0076DCT2G|3.0|I have found some of DeMille's stories to be gripping and compelling...this one not so much.  The hero's (John Corey) wiseass-ery becomes a little tedious and immature-sounding to me after a while and I find myself drifting to other reading material.
0345803485|5.0|So I was recently hit with a barrage of reviews on how I could enjoy a book that promotes abuse and violence against women. I hear of plans to ban the book. It all started with my responding to email that I felt instead of being a review on the opinion of the reader was more of a knock on other individuals who found the book enjoyable. I am all for opinions we all have rights but don't form judgements against others and question their background because we liked the book.<br /><br />What I found with most of these individuals was that they did not even read the book(s) to get a full understanding of what the book is about.<br /><br />First you must read all 3 books because they tie together. The book is about a young woman Anastasia who meets by chance Christian Grey (self made billionaire). Christian comes from a very dark abusive background and was placed in foster home. He understands nothing about love or the true expression of this. At a young age he is introduced to BDSM from an older woman and he then embraces this twisted form of affection.<br /><br />He meets Ana and throughout all 3 books you see how he tries to first introduce her to this lifestyle, he falls inlove with her but still has an unhealthy view of love and affection. If you continue to read the books you will see the transformation of a man who came from dark beginnings but the love between himself and Anastasia teaches him about true love and how he changes his beliefs in love and affection through the love Anastasia shows him.<br /><br />They grow together and Anastasia keeps some aspects of the sexual BDSM in the relationship she is comfortable with and Christian willingly adjusts/changes because he begins to learn that love is about giving/taking.<br /><br />This book is not about abusing women. There is no way I would support anything like that. It shows how the unloveable can be loved and change. It shows how a person abused and caught in a dark place mentally learns to love. A woman's love for a person that hated themselves a built an empire of success to cover his vulnerability.<br /><br />Why women enjoy it? The sex scenes are great. Intense. The fantasy of being whisked off via private jet is enjoyable. No one is broken mentally/emotionally for enjoying this book!<br /><br />If they can show movies like The Saw, Silent Hill, Cabin in the Woods and so much more to include crazy reality TV you are not going to be able to stop the productivity of these books and the movie.<br /><br />I support the books. I will be there for the movie when it comes out! Its ok to have beliefs but there is no need to knock others for enjoying a book and trying to spoil it for everyone by banning the books/movie. Most likely it's not going to happen anyway.<br /><br />The problem with society today is that it's always easy to blame others for things that began at home. If a book or a movie can influence behavior then the foundation at home was not stable to begin with.<br /><br />There is hope for the abused and the abuser if they want to change but don't blame E.L. James for that!<br /><br />Read the book guys it's wonderful.
B007EECSFA|5.0|I am suggesting this book to my book club and I am sure it will be enjoyed by all.  It is informative, suspensfull and we wonder until the end!!
0689835604|5.0|We have been reading this book in our household for months. I can only say months because my son is only 22 months old. Yet he already knows where to find, feet, toes, eyes, nose, ears, and hands! A big reason is because we have been able to use this highly engaging book to identify these. He loves this book and brings it to me regularly to have it read. Surprisingly he still doesn't know belly button, but we will get it soon! At 22 months he does well with this book independently, but be careful because the flaps are not made of the same board as the pages and are easily crunched accidentally by eager hands. Most of the wrinkles can be pressed out by simply closing the book and placing something heavy on top. This is a favorite in our large library!
B001B67VR2|1.0|Cannot review the music. I cannot even get the product downloaded properly.  Won't buy digital music from Amazon again. I purchase from Amazon all the time, this was my first try at a digital format (music) and I am frustrated with it. Thank you.
B008G8SFGO|3.0|For their 20th studio album in 40 years, Kiss lean into their strength as old-man rockers. \\"Monster\\" treads the same stomping grounds as past Kiss albums like \\"Revenge\\" or \\"Sonic Boom,\\" doing their utter best to capture passed glories, while still rocking righteously. Paul is still in fine voice and Gene is still in big ego. Expecting anything else?<br /><br />Well, you shouldn't be. Kiss has been Stanley/Simmons with sidemen since Ace and Peter left almost three decades ago. They have carried that with aplomb and made plenty of good music, even if the themes have not changed all that much. Gene still sings about being the demon and headed \\"Back To The Stone Age,\\" they still try and flaunt outsider status on \\"Freak,\\" and Tommy Thayer is coached to sound as much like Ace as he can on \\"Outta This World.\\" Drummer Eric Singer does his time on \\"All For The Love of Rock and Roll\\" too keep up the appearances of a democratic, four man band.<br /><br />Make no mistake, though. This is the Stanley/Simmons machine, with Paul still strutting his stuff (the love on an elevator saga \\"Take Me Down Below\\" and the first single \\"Hell or Hallelujah\\") and Gene still in arrested development (\\"The Devil Is Me\\"). The lone concession to trying something out of character is the a capella opening on \\"Eat Your Heart Out.\\" As for the rest of \\"Monster,\\" you've heard this before. It's not a bad Kiss album, it's just Kiss being Kiss.
B0010SKUYM|5.0|A new,unique take on the coming of age story with a blend of magic, science, and swordplay.  The characters are developed richly and with depth, warts and all.  A great read.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Nelson DeMille is one of the few writers that makes me laugh out loud.  John Corey is my favorite of his characters.  Suspense with a sarcastic wit.  What more could you want?

B003YL4LYI|5.0|If you've already read the other 4 books in this series there is no reason to stop now. The timeline is a little odd because it starts at basically the same place as book 4, but continues longer than book 4. If you were a fan of the previous books you won't be disappointed by this one.

B007GCY8FS|1.0|I'm a Lee Child fan from the very beginning and have purchased and read every novel. This one, however, is terrible.<br /><br />As painful as it is for me to say this, I think A Wanted Man is one of the worst books I've read.
B008CJ0KEM|5.0|This Canadian television show about a supernatural world (the Fae) that exists in secrecy among humans is so different from the typical fantasy TV show that it grabbed my attention immediately. It incorporates mythologies and cultural folklores; however, they are the \\"Lost Girl\\" version of myths and legends. It has characters, action, and escapades that are enthralling and entertaining. The creator and producers have described the series as a supernatural crime drama with light comedy and it definitely lives up to their description.<br /><br />The protagonist of Lost Girl is Bo (Anna Silk), a bisexual succubus that was adopted and raised by human parents. A succubus is a creature that must feed on the \\"chi\\" (the life force) of humans and Fae to survive; and when injured absorbs the chi and energy created during sexual encounters to heal. Being the modern version of the mythical succubus, Bo feeding or healing from either a male or female is irrelevant because it's all sexual healing to her. Bo accidentally killed her high school boyfriend by draining his chi during her first sexual encounter and it was after this incident that her parents told her she had been adopted. Thereafter, Bo fled from home and everything she had known, living a friendless existence, accumulating a history of chi-drained bodies; moving from city to city and creating a new identity each time.<br /><br />Bo saves a human woman, Kenzi (Ksenia Solo), from a rapist by draining his chi and when she realizes what Bo did for her, the two become instant friends (with Kenzi as Bo's streets-smart sidekick). This kill brings the heretofore unknown Bo to the attention of the local Fae clans. The Fae are powerful supernatural beings that have existed in secrecy among humans since the beginning of civilization, despising and using them for their own benefit. Their world is divided into two clans, the Light and Dark, with the Dark being the most evil and criminally-inclined of the two; however, although theLight Fae are more diplomatic, both sides use humans as slaves, servants, and food. Bo is abducted by two Fae police detectives and brought to the Light Fae leader, The Ash, for interrogation. It is here that Bo discovers that she is not the only one who is `different'. It is also here that she meets her future romantic lovers, the wolf-shifter and police detective, Dyson (Kris Holden-Ried); and Lauren (Zoie Palmer), the human physician & scientist obligated to serve The Ash. When the Ash orders Lauren (Dr. Lewis) to examine Bo and determine what kind of Fae she is, Bo is told by Lauren that she is a succubus and that, if she wanted to, she could learn to control her chi-feeding power and sexual drive. Each clan wants Bo to align herself with one or the other, but after being forced to defend herself in a contest trial, Bo refuses to abandon her ties to humanity and determines to search for the truth about her origins and who she really is. Rounding the cast of central characters are Trick (Richard Howland), owner and bartender of the local Fae tavern, \\"The Dal Riata\\"; and Hale (K.C. Collins), a siren & police detective working alongside Dyson. Minor characters include The Morrigan (Emmanuelle Vaugier), vengeful leader of the Dark Fae with an instant dislike of Bo; and Vex, a mesmer serving as the henchman for The Morrigan, and a darling of the Dark Fae Elders.<br /><br />The women of Lost Girl are strong, resourceful, and live their lives on their own terms. The interpersonal relationships between men and women are equal in status in spite of their differences. Compared to the sex scenes involving Dyson, the first lovemaking scene between Bo and Lauren may seem tame, but it is nevertheless intense. (Fact: The pilot for the show later became Episode 8 of Season 1, and contains the initial lesbian love scene between Bo and Lauren. Regardless of what naysayers may say, from the outset the relationship with Lauren was intended to be as essential to Bo's emotional evolution as her relationship with Dyson.)<br /><br />Along with the creatures, adventures, rolls in the hay, cleavage, and Bo's intrepid journey to find her place in the world with the family she creates along the way, Lost Girl is very much about a sex-positive universe where sexual orientation is not judged. The core nature of Fae and humans, and their interconnections, are not affected by any one of them being bisexual, heterosexual, or homosexual.<br /><br />Lost Girl is produced by Prodigy Pictures for Canada's Showcase TV network and broadcast by the Syfy TV network in the United States, United Kingdom (UK and Ireland), and Australia. The DVD & Blu-ray contain the unedited episodes as shown on Canadian television (Season 1 has 13 episodes; Season 2 has 22 episodes; Season 3 has 13 episodes). Episodes running time: 44 minutes.<br /><br />Lost Girl is rated TV-MA (Mature Audiences Only) L-S-V (Language, Sex, Violence) and may be unsuitable for those younger than 17 years of age.<br /><br />(Unhappy news about the Blu-ray I received: when I opened the package all three discs were covered with dust, with the third disc having the most on it. I dusted them off and played the third disc first and the sound quality of the first episode, particularly the voices of male actors, was slightly distorted in several scenes.)
B008OOYALE|2.0|it was great until i closed it then went back...it deleted everything and i had to start over this happened several times finally i gave up and uninstalled it.

B006LSZECO|3.0|I was rooting for her...waiting for the moment they NAILED the husband and he got what he deserved.  Wow, things are not how they appear.<br /><br />While I couldn't read the book quickly enough, I found myself more than a bit disturbed by the end.  I admit that I like books that end with all the loose ends tied up prettily in a bow.  This was not one of those endings.  I hope I never meet anyone like this woman in my life (i.e. psychopath).
B009NQKXYK|1.0|From weak dialogues to non-sense everything, this movie was made for the same crowd that loves watching Jersey Shore, Honey Boo-Boo and worship the Kardashians, that is, the dumb people.<br />When in the world scientists sent to another planet to discover somethign BIG say that they are in the missinon just because of the money and not for the finding? What's the point in having Charlize Tehron in the movie?What about that \\"replicant\\" role? What was his objective in the movie?<br />Im going to describe this movie in one tiny word: JOKE.<br />I expected more from the director and wished the best for Noomi Rapace,who is the only one acting well, as expected.<br />Dont waste your 5 bucks for this one,people.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this is one of my favorite games! It's. fun and there is always something to do.  the graphics are good and I love building my own little &quot;dragon kingdom &quot;
B003H9MSPG|4.0|First thing worth noting is that the rifle will jam if you're not familiar with using it. And if it jams, don't expect to reuse the bullet it got jammed on. But there is a good excuse for this<br /><br />That being, this rifle works a lot like a real bolt action firearm, or at least compared to the pump action rifles which I find are kinda a silly concept as pumping a rifle to get it to fire is very unrealistic.<br /><br />I won't spoil how to use the gun but I can say you have to get a feel for the method of firing it before you can go running around the park like a madman shooting it at random children(EG: not a toy for kids who can't get past the rifle's complexity. get them a gun that works similar to the night finder if they are too young to figure out stuff like this or have low attention spans).<br /><br />Now getting passed getting used to the gun, it's hella entertaining to use. whether you use the stock and fill it with two quick reload clips to give you extra ammo, or you go with the barrel extension and the flip grenade launcher style sight, or if you're a madman like me you go without the stock or the barrel and just go rambo with it using a drum magazine(this is definitely a nerf gun you'll want extensions from other nerf guns on, by the way), you are bound to have hella fun times with it.<br /><br />Just don't put the stock in unless you want to keep it in for a while, as the only way to get it out is too unscrew the back of the gun and lift it out.<br /><br />Now, the down side to the gun is that it has a weak range for a \\"sniper,\\" which is estimated 25-35 feet, depending on if you use the barrel extension or not. However, a cheap way to bring that up to 30-40 feet is to tape down the unjamming door and air release thingies on the sides of where the clips go with clear household tape. This will give the gun more pressure and make this a very very good mid range rifle. That mixed with the realistic feel of a real rifle, it's definitely worth it for the older, more dedicated nerf fans.<br /><br />Bottom Line:<br />Pros:<br />-Realistic feeling that requires a more professional handing.<br />-Good for customization with other nerf accessories.<br />-Overall quality mid range nerf rifle.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Hard on casual/beginner users and those who have very little respect for the toy (EG not for little kids)<br />-Can really mess with ammo if you jam the gun.<br />-Stock is semi permanent and you're technically not supposed to remove the stock anyways. (Best to decide before you put it in if you want it to have a stock or not)<br />-Shorter range then marketed for. (I wouldn't hold this against the toy itself as everything is over marketed these days. The rifle is for midrange and is meant to be realistic, it's not supposed to be a super sniper that you can running around firing the bullets 70 feet away from you without going into an ark. Not even the Elite rifles do that.)<br /><br />Disclaimer: I do not recommend that the people who buy this product do modifications to the gun that require opening it or removing screws. The only modification I recommended was the one about putting tape over the external holes that lead to where the bullets go, which does not involve any tampering of the hardware internally and hence does not count as an illegal modification. I hope any moderators understand I have no intent of breaking Hasbro or Amazon regulations. Thank you.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|difficult reading  language archaic  confusing  so many good books so little time.  no time to waste on poorly written books.  find another book on which to spend your time.
B009QW6ZT8|5.0|Yes, I am a fangirl of walking dead and season 3 takes us out of the fishbowl of our survivors and opens up the world a bit more in the story.<br />The characters are awesome, the storyline a bit slow but intense as well and continuously developing, and the gore factor is just as bout as gross as you can get<br />for public TV! love love love it.

B009D0LBRO|4.0|For such a basic game, it is quite addicting.  While it is short (dedicated players can finish it in one day), it sucks you in and makes you want to finish it.
B00723NWJE|5.0|Look I'm a new fan here, and that might be something to consider when reading this review. People that don't like this album are those types of people that want the next thing to be just like the last. I have downloaded and listened to the other albums and MUST SAY that this album is very different in a lot of ways, but it's really good. It's got some mellow dramatic tones, as well as some that are upbeat and catchy. Overall, it should be known that I like rock, metal, punk, and industrial music. This is a bit of a reach from that stuff, but this is the album that actually got my attention. But if you're looking for this album to sound like the last ones, then you may be disappointed.
B005ETA5K2|5.0|I travel a lot and frequently cannot get good signals. I bought the full length antenna in addition to the adaptor. I now have incredible connections almost everywhere. I am very pleased.
0385342063|5.0|I've read all her books and loved this one as much as any of the others. The characters are so real that, even though, I was forced by circumstances to put the book down for a month right near the end, I picked it up last night and found the plot and characters still vivid in my mind even after all that time. The ending was the usual big fun surprise. It's a light fun easy escape book and just the pick-me-up I needed.
B008OOYALE|5.0|easy game. good to waste time with. child friendly with pretty graphics. will continue to play. add id kylern. thanks in advanced.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This story harkens back to the style of science fiction writing you might have seen in the 1940s-1960s.  This is not my usual genre (I am more partial to epic fantasy), but I found this story thoroughly enjoyable.  It took me until Book 2 to really get into it, but I found myself invested in the characters and in the story.  Overall, this story revolves around a clever concept that is generally well-executed.  There are also a number of twists which are not immediately obvious to the reader, which I found refreshing.  It's definitely a worthwhile read, and the price is tough to beat.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|What a great series. the actors and the costumes were perfect.The homes wow!  Enjoyed it very much.  The second series was just as good as the first.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have never been more happy with a app, always very accurate and love that with a touch I can find out the weather anywhere.. Thank You for it.
B005NJ2K6U|5.0|This app works fine, on my coby mid 8042 tab. It holds my interest. I only use the untimed  play. The music is very relaxing, and am enjoying it. It was worth the $1.99!
B003XI4LUQ|4.0|This was a good remake of the classic movie. Looking forward to the sequel. I would recommend watching it. Lots of action.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|After I had trouble with the netflix app, after the last update, this app came up as the faotd,  so I tried it, and now I'm hooked on these treasure hunt games!!!! Just love it. So much better than the older connect 3 games. I'm always looking out for them.
B004SBQGHS|4.0|I think whoever thought of the slingshoting birds on Angry Birds should get a big  reward.And if he already did congradulations to him or her.<br />  I LOVE IT!!!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was glued to the book. I found it hard to put down. Already read #6 and can't wait for more. Is there more in the future.
B003THJA1G|5.0|I love to click a few buttons and with great ease watch one of my favorite shows with great viewing quality....
B0070Y46UY|5.0|An extraordinarily broad dissertation on life and one's religious outlook. The peacefulness of his upbringing has passed forward in his life and was expressed with exceptional clarity. The ending was unexpected however should have been expected due to the ordeal.
B009GEPSPI|4.0|This movie is not a horror movie but it is a very good thriller/mystery. It's unfortunate that it may be associated with the child stealing Slenderman legend. I though the acting was good and the story pretty interesting. I would recommend it. It is better than most of the stuff that comes out these days.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I had heard many people talk about Pinterest and I finally joined the bandwagon. I love using the app on my Kindle Fire, very easy to use and no problems. lots of great ideas found here!
B009CPJHY4|5.0|A fantastic movie that lifts the spirit and lightens the heart!  With this ensemble cast you really can't go wrong, and the film is so touching, endearing, and inspiring, you can't help but smile by the end of it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|The second book is better than the first.  More exciting and less grafic.  I highly enoyed this book, and would recommend it to others.
034580404X|5.0|Great price and delivered in a timely manner.  This is a great book but could have done without some of the details.  Yes, I can see a sequel coming.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|To be honest this book was pretty boring until you were more than half way done with the book.  I wish there would have been less flash back and more action.  It did bring a good ending to the trilogy however.
B008FSCNTK|3.0|Dianna Krall might be the best jazz pianist of our modern day.<br />Her piano playing is great but her song work is a little weak on this album.<br />Striving for a different sound and feel she has lost her way a bit.<br />Not the great album that we come to expect from Diana but still a solid listen
B009G8GRX6|5.0|The 2nd Law is a wonderful journey from start to finish. From the \\"Bond\\" theme sound of \\"Supremacy\\" with Matt's notorious falsettos, the very cool electronic feel of \\"Madness\\", the awesome funk of \\"Panic Station\\", and the official 2012 Olympic theme \\"Survival\\", this album is a great mix of music. It definitely their most different album. The sounds of Matt's unborn son's heartbeat gives a nice start to \\"Follow Me\\" while \\"Animals\\" touches on the corruption on Wall Street. I can't say enough about the album. For the First time ever bassist Chris Wolstenholme sings two of his songs, \\"Save Me\\" and \\"Liquid State\\". The 2nd Law ends with the dubsteb sounds in \\"Unsustainable\\" and the mellow piano and somewhat upbeat \\"Isolated System\\". It is a must have for any music collection.
B008AIGWVA|1.0|I never got a chance to download this on my Kindle fire because this app does not work on it. Must be for phone only.<br />I would love to have a talking dog on my Kindle fire, as I read the reviews and most people liked this app. just not for me I suppose. Maybe they will make one for the Kindle fire in the future.
B0060QM0AG|5.0|I love James Herriot's books!  I love all things 'veterinarian'.  He makes the stories so personable, humorous, and touching.  I'm looking forward to reading all his books.
B0090O07S2|5.0|If you are a long time Doors fan then this is a MUST own! I always thought this was a good concert but now that its complete and cleaned up its simply OUTSTANDING! I love hearing complete high quality live versions of Spanish Caravan and Hello I Love You. The picture and sound have been improved by so much you might as well throw your old copy away. Hats off to The Doors and all involved on this now definitive DOORS show.
B009MZQQWA|5.0|Rocky Horror is still as fun and fresh today as it was30 years ago I highly recommend it.  The new hd version has improved sound quality over past versions which makes it better!
B009KHDT0C|3.0|I wanted to see this movie from the first time I heard about it ..<br /><br />It wasn't nearly as good as I had hoped for ...
B002APU580|4.0|I really really really like the 6 hour Pride and Prejudice with Colin Firth (or is it Furth?).  Anyway, I didn't have 6 hours to spend watching, so I chose this video on my Kindle Fire.  It downloaded great and was really easy to watch.  It is a bit different from the 6 hour P&P but oh so definitely good.  I have a hard time following the book.  What can I say?  Maybe it was my public education.  So the 6 hour Colin Firth series helped tremendously but this movie is a good substitute for that one. I enjoyed the actors and how they portrayed the characters.  See this movie and judge for yourself!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|As the difficulty increases I am amazed how I will think there is no correct answer and yet one pops to mind as I get flowing.
B006L9B6TI|5.0|Awesome book. I'm on day 14 and I already see it working! Get it as soon as you can! The magic is waiting for you
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers because you can jump side to side and up and down.<br />And I realy like it because you get cool gagets too.
B000I9TY4G|4.0|This was a good way to take the Firefly series and partially wrap it up. I wish that the series had had a few more seasons, but a movie isn't a bad way to go either.
B0087DFIOU|4.0|Get the Gringo is a crime thriller starring Mel Gibson. I don't remember it getting a wide release, probably due to Gibson being poisonous in Hollywoood, but it's a good movie and worth watching.<br />Gibson plays a professional criminal who commits a multi-million-dollar robbery and ends up in Mexico.  Corrupt Mexican cops take the money and throw him in \\"El Pueblito,\\" a prison/city ruled by criminals.  Families, including children, live with the prisoners inside the walls.  Life in El Pueblito is nasty and brutish.  Luckily, Gibson's character is a real brute.<br />His character is not a nice man.  He's mean enough to steal from a blind guy, and the sort of thug who has removed his own fingerprints and berates a heist partner for inconveniencing him by getting gut-shot.  Still, he has Gibson's charm, and he makes friends, including a kid played by professional scene-stealer Kevin Hernandez, and the kid's hot mom, played by Dolores Heredia. The Gringo is struggling to survive and at the same time scheming to get his money back.  Meanwhile, we become aware that criminals on both sides of the border are after the money, and will stop at nothing to get it.<br />The plot requires some leaps of faith, some very convenient coincidences.  Still, that doesn't subtract too much from a slam-bang action thriller that barrels along at a relentless pace.  If you watch this movie, I expect you will be sucked in. Be warned: ultra-Catholic Gibson may avoid nudity in his recent films, but this film is ultra-violent. It is not for kids.
B009NQKPUW|3.0|Awesome effects and cast.  Great potential to be a fantastic movie, but it followed way too many plot points of the 'Alien' films without offering anything substantially new.  Glad I didn't watch it at the theater.  Ridley Scott could have done so much more with this.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I hate this games because the people who made this game just coppied temple run and also because there are too many excapes
B0094LU2TU|5.0|I loved this movie. Great dialogue, lots of improvisation, great story, etc. JUST DO NOT WATCH THE TRAILER! The trailer was the worst part of the movie, as it destroys a key scene.<br />I suppose this generation prefers the Michael Bay, \\"boom boom, boobs, boom, orange tans, boom boom, no no no no no\\" stuff, so maybe that's why any amount of dialogue and story telling may disturb their delicate minds. Heck, I like those cookie cutter movies too, but it's nice to see someone put out a movie with some real feeling in it.<br />I would love to see more movies like this style.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|This game is pretty fun. I don't like how if you want more money you have to actually pay for it though. That's ridiculous!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|After hearing all the talk of this book, I expected so much more.  Maybe the women reading it need to step up their own sex life???? Thought it was degrading to women and the ending just plain SUCKED. Will not waste my time on the next two.
0062200399|5.0|I love this story and there are few fantasy/fairie tale stories that are this good.  I was very happy to see a new hard cover edition, but the hard cover gift edition omits all the wonderful illustrations from the trade paperback edition - very dissappointing!
B004LROUNG|4.0|I hadn't read a Grisham book for a very long time, because I felt he'd become formulaic and I was bored.  This book is a welcome refute of that notion.  As good as his early books; fun, interesting and very enjoyable reading.  Recommended!
B006OOHYIC|5.0|It reminds me of chess a lot,  but more challenging.  Getting a perfect score requires exact moves no slop, you reeeeally have to think ahead!  Great game, two thumbs up!!
B0083P1QUM|3.0|I have followed Patricia Cornwell since her very successful career began.  Many, many good reads but this is not one of them.
B000M341QE|5.0|I just watched it on FX and... it was incredible. The story line is pretty damn epic. The ending, is wow, you need to get it. That's all I have to say.
0316228532|5.0|This book is darker and bleaker than you might have wanted, but she creates a place and time that you can visualize and then she creates characters that are so real you feel you are watching a real story unfold in a real place.  Magic.  She made us believe in Hogwarts and Harry Potter, and now she proves she can bring the same skills to an adult novel.  I hope she writes more adult fiction.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I have a couple of short stories that have been laying around because I didn't know how to publish them.  This book gives you a step by step guide with all the necessary standards and is very useful to someone like myself.  Recommended if you want to see your book on the Kindle list!
B009UR2QMO|5.0|Once Upon a Time has become the most original and moving fantasy on television, reinterpreting the old fairy tales yet remaining true to their message of hope, courage and grace under pressure. The residents of Storybrooke Maine are fairytale characters who have been enchanted and transported into our world with no memory of their lives in the Enchanted Forest. Emma Swann, daughter of Snow and Charming was sent away before the curse struck so she could fulfill her destiny of breaking the curse. The first season alternates between the present in Storyville and the past in the Enchanted Forest, retelling all of the tales that we love so much.<br /><br />In the second season, the curse is broken, but a new curse has taken its place, trapping the residents of Storyville, with their memories, but unable to leave. Snow and her daughter Emma are now trapped in the Enchanted Forest looking for a way back to Storyville and a way to break the curse. In this episode, Rumpelstiltskin and his past are under the microscope. Just how did Rumpel become the dark one and why did he trap the residents of Storyville again just as the curse of Regina was lifted. The answers may surprise you but they will always delight. A wonderful backstory for a classic villain. Captain Hook makes an appearance as well and we finally learn just how the crocodile got his hand.<br /><br />Watch Once Upon a Time, start with the first season and keep going as this reinvention of the classic tales is enchanting, well written, well acted and all of the production values are superb. In particular, the costumer and set designer must be having a field day of fun. Just wonderful.
B008F5YDRI|5.0|\\"Salmon Fishing in the Yemen\\" is an entertaining and engaging film.  Overall, it is a movie about hope, faith, leadership and vision presented at four levels. It is a simple and predictable  love story.  It is about the importance of leadership and the ability of people to do the impossible once the barriers of their own preconceptions were removed.  It is about politicians' opportunism.  And finally is was about how the mean actions of just a few people can undo the good work of many.<br /><br />As with many movies, it helps to \\"suspend disbelief\\" once the film starts.  And like the river in Yemen, at points the movie seem a bit shallow, but that doesn't matter.  It is still  thought provoking and entertaining.  It also passes my personal test for whether it was a good movie or not, and that is do I look forward to seeing it a second time.  I do.<br /><br />Cudos and thanks to the producer at CBS films and all who were involved in bringing this film from conception to the theater.

B008673ZAQ|5.0|If you liked 50 Shades of Gray will enjoy the Crossfire series.  I read the first book Bared To You a few months ago and hand no problem picking up right where I left off.  Just wish the third book was out.  This series has a good story line, steamy sex, and romance.

B0083GQ2A0|1.0|Sorry Liam but this is not your best product. We all know that you are better than this. If it is on sale, get it and than use your 30 days to watch it. Hopefully you have 2 hours to waist in that time period.

B009CPJHY4|5.0|Very enjoyable movie about life and its turns. If you are interested in chance or how others suffer with you and yet live life to its fullest and become compassionate people watch this movie.
030759565X|5.0|I've loved the smitten kitchen for at least 6 years. I still visit it occasionally, but with a 2 1/2 year old in the house, it's harder to cook from a website. Poof! Now there's a cookbook! Every Deb recipe I've ever tried has been knock out of the park delicious. Just tried 2 from the cookbook & the entire family is happy. Buy this.<br /><br />PS I bake the sk pita bread & cocoa brownies at least twice/month. Easy, fast, yummy recipes that the kid loves to help pull together. Thanks, Deb!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Awesome movie. Would recommend to anyone who enjoyed Thor or Ironman or Captain America. Worth watching more than once :-)
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Had a hard time putting this game down. A little creepy at times, but still a very well done game. Looking forward to the sequel!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|it da best.just got it. it is da most addicting game ever. I suggest this game to everyone.its just a little laggy
B0098VYCCE|4.0|Definitely the adult side of the fairy tale. Fantasy elements were very well done and different than seen in other movies. That is my favorite part of the movie. Kristen Stewart's acting, as always, IMO, lacked, but she was a little better here than in the Twilight Sagas. Charlize did well but a little over the top. The fantasy and action was much better on the big screen and the story, on repeat view at home, became somewhat tiresome. Worth seeing though.
B0041CGOZS|5.0|I just started to listen to this CD today, and I am very satisfied that I bought this greatest hits album.
B008BD9SI8|5.0|SPOILERS!<br /><br />This was another great story by the best author out there right now.  Some people have complained but I loved how Joe did something different.  This IS a western fantasy hybrid.  Everything about it screams western.  The writing style, the way people talk, the gold rush towns, the \\"Ghosts\\" (Joe's version of the American Indian), some duels, cattle drives, fights on top of a runaway stage coach full of gold!  Everything!  And yet it was all Circle of the World fantasy at the same time.  Several characters you know and love are here (again, I said spoilers), Logen, Cosca, Carlot dan Eider, Shivers, Friendly, the list goes on.  Same awesome Joe writing, just in a Western package.  Some have complained that Logen should have been a main pov so we can get in his head but I think Joe was able to convey Logen's thoughts and feelings enough through the various pov's for me to get my Logen \\"fix.\\"  Loved the ending.  Can't wait for more.  Thank you Joe!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|very very very very very very very very fun to play buying different animals and the thrill of kung tu scratch when I won the acorns.  wow I like this game very much
B008XX6J4C|5.0|I really like this CD--listened to it on my way to Austin. Just Groved on down 290! Let my neices listen to it when we went shopping--they were able to pick out the Adele song and also the Star Wars, plus a couple of others that I had not heard before. Will have to get another of their CD's.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|It took them months, but they finally got it working again. Glad to see it, but it was LONG over due. Why couldnt they have reverted their version till they worked the kinks out.
B004FGMDOQ|3.0|The author did a good job of linking history with fantasy.  Unfortunately, it fail a little flat at the end and left you hanging.  As fiction goes, it was just okay.
B009YDB2QK|5.0|Five stars for ANYTHING The Walking Dead does so far.  I've never been a zombie movie fan.  Cant say I've sat through a full zombie movie, beginning to end, in my whole life.  But I just love the Walking Dead.  So well acted, such great special effects, fantastic characters, storyline, all of it is terrific.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is the most addicting thing. dont remember what i used to do in my free time bp (before pinterest)
