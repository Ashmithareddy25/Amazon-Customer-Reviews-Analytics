B000002LA2|5.0|In 1986 this album represented the second in a series of of three records that represent a comeback album for Eric Clapton. He'd really began to modernize to the new decade with his previous album [[ASIN:B000002L6U Behind the Sun]] but,all the same that albums sound was based essentially in his classic blues rock sound of the 70's. On this album the same brew is boiling: Greg Phillinganes,Phil Collins and Nathan East are still on board but the sound is based in something very different. A decade before this Boz Scaggs had actually done somewhat of the same thing with his [[ASIN:B000HEZF90 Silk Degrees]];the idea was to do a contemporary R&B/soul album that wasn't based in an old timey sound. And that to a degree is what Clapton was going for here. The blues element of Claptons sound is downplayed to a huge degree here as songs such as the Lamont Dozier penned \\"Run\\" and \\"Hung Up On Your Love\\" take presidents. These songs are heavy on a certain type of rhythmic electro funk kind of sound with some somewhat avante garde synthesizer sounds. This may in a word be why this album doesn't rate well with a lot of Clapton fans-it still has his strong musical crunch to it but much as with the similarly underrated [[ASIN:B00000348M A Cappella]] by Todd Rundgren this is not a noisy guitar based record and is by and large an 80's R&B/funk oriented one that,by virtue of the artist was filed under rock. That crunch is present to a somewhat higher degree on \\"Bad Influence\\",co-written by Robert Cray and \\"Hold On\\" featuring Tina Turner. All that means is they have a retro rhythm & blues grit with a modern sensability. Clapton,a musician who by his own admittance didn't spend a lot of time with studio people was actually learning a lot about that retro/modern style of R&B on this album,probably because of the presence of Tom Dowd. \\"Take A Chance\\" and \\"Miss You\\" actually have a strong horn funk sensability but one of the most vital songs here is the Michael Jackson.Ryuichi Sakamoto penned \\"Behind The Mask\\". Greg Phillingages first recorded is much more of a polished,clean MJ style on his 1985 sophmore solo album [[ASIN:B001J1M0IO Pulse]] (also really worth hunting for) and although Claptons take on it isn't that much of a different arrangement again there's a bit more of a grittiness to it. So what we have here in the end is a very mid 80's style production of rock n soul with both styles in about equal measure. Certain Clapton finds won't find this much to their liking;that is a face. But those that give it a chance for what it is are in for a very rewarding musical experience.l Jackson.Ryuichi Sakamoto penned \\"Behind The Mask\\".

B0036EH3WK|3.0|I love TV shows and - probably like you - I've watched tons of them. But I no longer feel as enthused about the plots as I did before. Especially with \\"Multi Season\\" shows.  The main reason is because, most of the times - if not every time -, those responsible for the plot (the writers) have no idea how it's going to end. And LOST is what one could call a \\"Case Study\\" for this. You can be sure that, as you watch the first and second seasons, writers had no intent - at that time - to end the story the way they did. They didn't have a clue on how to end it. Take the time and watch actor interviews at the first and second season's end and it will become obvious.  And there isn't a single hint that you can honestly say \\"I could have had this whole thing figured out in the first season, had I noticed this before\\" - it's probably the other way around.  Another thing writers tend to do is up the stakes to incredible heights in the end (in BSG, the same happened) - so that you won't feel you've been wasting your time.  If you're still not convinced writers don't have a clue how the plot is going to end, just consider this: the end is not up to the writers: it's about the audiences' expectations (namely how they feel the show should end) and producers' strategies.  Keep in mind every show is a \\"product\\".  In the end, what writers have to do is make sure that the finale they ended-up-with is somehow coherent with the first seasons. And let's face it: ending LOST the way they did is the easiest way out imaginable! they didn't even have to bother \\"wrapping up\\" most of the subplots: our minds will make some sense of them somehow.  Perhaps my bitterness can be justified in trying to find genius and art where there is none to be found: only a product, deserving as much consideration by a specialized marketing team as a new detergent.    That said, still a very decent show, considering the formulaic crap we are fed everyday.
B002ZG980U|4.0|\\"Inception\\" is a multi-layered plot based on dreams and navigating the subconscious to plant information and ideas.  The film is polished and the script must have taken a genius locked in a room for at least a decade to write.  Top notch special effects and cinematography give the viewer the feel of disorientation and being in the characters' dreamworld, fighting to climb between layers of consciousness.  The movie needs the viewer to  take great leaps of faith on what dreams and the power of suggestion can do.<br /><br />The hero, Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio) feels lost in time and space, what is real.  Like the children's song ending - is life \\"But a dream\\"?  The movie hops between dreams and reality.  You begin to wonder what is reality, where am I in this story?<br /><br />Cobb had a wife that could not understand if she was in a dream or in reality.  This is the problem in his most important dream.  How can Cobb keep her from ruining his most important plan  - a plan that will return him home to his two children?<br /><br />Cobb says we often do not remember the beginning of a dream, do we need to?  -  and what is dream time?  Is it possible to share others' consciousness in a group dream and can time be synchronized with everyone else you are interacting with?  How do you know where you are and how long you have to finish a project?  \\"Inception\\" is adrift in time and levels of dream experience. We are never sure where Cobb or his crew is in reality.<br /><br />Cobb's job is to enter the minds of other men to steal ideas.  Cobb is hired by a high-level energy executive (and billionaire)  to insert an idea into a rival's mind so the rival believes completely that it is his own idea.  The rival then embraces the spirit and feeling of something that he may have fought in real life.  The energy executive is Saito (Ken Watanabe) and this \\"dream job\\" would end Cobb's forced exile from his children and father-in-law, Miles (Michael Caine).<br /><br />So Cobb has the money to put together a cutting-edge team of dream specialists.  He works with long-time partner, Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), a new dream architect Ariadne, (Ellen Page). a couple of other helpers, as well as a chemist that puts together potions for deep, shared dreams.  They hop on a trans-Pacific jet with targeted Billionaire, Robert Fischer, Jr.(Cillian Murphy) that Saito wants him to change his mind and initiate the thought he can be his own man, he can break up his corporation and move on to make his own life.  A positive thought, instead of surrendering his corporation - just framing the idea in a good way to eliminate opposition.<br /><br />Adriadne, the architect, creates the labyrinths and mazes that the participants must maneuver throughout the three levels of the dream, and must be there for the \\"idea changers\\" as time, space and reality change.  She learns the art of controlling and navigating through dreams.  The films fantastic special effects are exquisitely effective with the unique and well-thought out script.  There are gunfights and car crashes as Fischer evidently has had some dream training and carries along his bodyguards to protect his subconscious. Even though there are many chase and gunfights it does not get old as you feel otherworldly along with the cast.  A different feeling overwhelms as gravity and perception change along with the characters moving from dream level to dream level still tethered in each dream's \\"now.\\"<br /><br />Everyone is taking risks to go to such deep levels of dreaming, but Cobb is taking danger to the hilt by not moving on from his grief and deep guilt complex involving his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard).  She interferes in his dream world and sometimes overlaps in the main mission.  How this is resolved is important and white knuckled excitement.<br /><br />The movie grabs your gut as well as your imagination.

B000002L6U|5.0|Now obviously this is not Eric Claptons first album of the decade. But after 1983's [[ASIN:B00004Y6NL Money & Cigarettes]] Clapton obviously understood it was time to modernize his sound more fully. Now this was 1985 and pop music in general was dominated by a lot of gated drums and sounds that really didn't suit Clapton's style very well so that may have been way he didn't follow contemporaries Steve Winwood and Rod Stewart's early lead on the 80's new wave/synth rock style. It obviously took a lot of soul searching to figure out how Clapton was going to come into this sound during it's peak and not destroy his own musically qualities. In the end not only did he jettison some of his old blues players in favor of more contemporary session musicians such as Michael Omartian,bassist Nathan East and Greg Phillinganes (who became a huge part of his band at that time) and chose Phil Collins and Ted Templeton as producer fors the album. Lucky for us Eric Clapton and Phil Collins in particular actually made a really good fit and not only is the music endowed with with some of the darkly hued harmonics of 80's Genesis but that sound was actually a rather far off variation of blues chords anyway so it was the perfect way for Clapton to get in on the sound of the era \\"She's Waiting\\",with it's destinctive drum sound and melody is the perfect pairing of both musicians and that feeling is extended across \\"It All Depends\\",\\"Never Make You Cry\\" and \\"Just Like A Prisoner\\". So is Clapton's brilliant 8+ minute \\"Same Old Blues\\" which contains some of his most electric playing of the era as well as a central musical theme that bares the insecent repetition that it gets. \\"See What Love Can Do\\" and \\"Something's Happening\\" are both poppier,brighter tunes that have that hint of a caribbean/reggae rhythm that Clapton had dealt with during the late 70's and now was bringing them into the next decade. This album is also of course has a heavy soul flavor with a really well produced mid 80's version of Eddie Floyd's \\"Knock On Wood\\" and the rhythmically strident keyboard funk of \\"Forever Man\\". \\"Tangled In Love\\",with it's actually does resemble one of Steve Winwood's 80's soul/new wave hyrbids of the early to mid 80's. The album ends with the warm and very George Harrison like title song. This album not only turned out to be a significant change in direction for Clapton but,after a couple false starts this album actually ended up being the beginning of a very successful comeback for Eric Clapton in this decade.well produced mid 80's version of Eddie Floyd's \\"Knock On Wood\\" and the rhythmically strident keyboard funk of \\"Forever Man\\". \\"Tangled In Love\\",with it's actually does resemble one of Steve Winwood's 80's soul/new wave hyrbids of the early to mid 80's.

B000002KD5|5.0|This album has no weak song and listenable all the way through, which is why I'm giving it such a high score...I'm starting to feel that a very pleasant listen is worth a high score even though an album may not be chock-a-block with \\"killer\\" songs (usually accompanied by filler). Bob Dylan's \\"Blood on the tracks\\" could have been as good as this album, if weren't for a couple of tracks which just made you want to skip to the next song. Not sure what year this version of my cd was released...it contains no bonus tracks as some re-issues are wont to do. The sound on here is delicate...not as loud as other albums played at the same volume on my stereo. In this case it's a good thing. With the introduction into the band of Stevie Nicks and Lindsey Buckingham, you get the defining line-up of the band, with their signature California sound, I suppose you'd call it. Vocal duties are nicely shared here between Lindsey, Stevie and Christine.      The classic \\"/\\":      Say you love me - has a familiar, jaunty piano riff. Christine McVie's distinctive vocals shine here. Nice bass and lead guitar break. Stevie sings backing vocals here.    Landslide - an Easter egg song. I'm giving this a smaller tick than the previous song...bumped it from a \\".\\" in my convoluted song rating sytem! A mellow, pretty song with dual acoustic lead guitars. You do hear an electric lead guitar for one part. Stevie sings. No other instruments feature.      Next best \\"(.)\\":      Warm ways - has a sort of Hawaiian guitar sound on the lead...maybe with a \\"The air that I breathe\\" feel to it. Christine sings. Pleasant. Has two familiar elements in the vocals and melody. Got a note about chorus and melody being different pop songs...not sure if I mean it reminds me of two different songs or the song itself has distinct parts. Guitar sounds delicate here as do the drums...which sound padded.    Rhiannon - delicate guitars again. The best known song on this album...it has iconic guitar parts, including the the guitar break. Stevie takes the lead vocal duties here...her signature song. Nice padded drum rhythm again, with an emphatic beat thrown in. Lead guitar part and backing vocals.      Best of the rest \\"[.]\\":      World turning - a bit country, perhaps, with some arty blues thrown into the mix. Slide guitar utilised, I think. Lindsey and Christine sing...dual vocals at times. Has a mellow \\"Black Betty\\" vibe to it...in a country blues sort of way. Cymbals feature.    I'm so afraid - interesting vibe with the strumming guitar...moody/broody. Has soulful lead guitar. Lindsey's vocals are soulful too. Has keyboards and I like Mick's drumming in this.      The rest:      Monday morning - album opens with Lindsey's distinctive vocals. He sounds a little bit country, as does his lead guitar. Guitar sound is delicate.  Bass is nice and the drums have a padded sound quality to them which are repeated in other tracks on the album. Stevie is on backing vocal duties and I think that Christine may be too.    Blue letter - more of a rock song. Has regular drum sounds (not padded). Country music flavoured lead guitar. Lindsey sings. Stevie on backing vocals.    Over my head - Christine sings. Drums are bongoes or some such. Nice bass playing. Organ and piano feature. . A pleasant song. Christine on backing vocals. Some sort of steel string instrument features.    Crystal - Lindsey sings. Delicate guitar sound. Keyboard notes are delicate too...has a Hammond organ vibe to it, I think. Steel string guitar. Another pleasant song, with Stevie on backing vocals.    Sugar daddy - sort of a variation on \\"Say you love me\\" as far as the piano/organ goes, I think. Christine sings. A mellow song but with a stronger beat by Mick on drums.

Grace's parents only see Grace and Sam's relationship as a temporary fling, so Grace finds herself lying more and more to be with Sam. It might've been okay if the secrets and lies didn't start piling up from there. A terrifying realization makes Grace lie to Sam, and past fears cause Sam to bury his secrets too. In the midst of all this, the new additions to the wolf pack only add stress to the already complicated situation. Everyone is fighting an uphill battle--for love, humanity, and life--but how can they win when all the odds are stacked against them?<br /><br />Before reading Linger, I didn't really care if there was a sequel to Shiver, but now that I have, I'm undoubtedly glad I did. It's difficult to say anything about this novel's plot without revealing too much because nearly all the details turn out to be significant to the very surprising ending. I have to say that I'm completely impressed with this story; it's quite fantastic how Stiefvater was able to extend the already unique story in Shiver into an even more original, exciting, and complex one in Linger. Stiefvater adds a new layer of complications to the mystery of the wolf pack, allowing this story to be all the more interesting, both because of these new complications and for the numerous twists and turns it encourages. This second installment in the Shiver trilogy is without a doubt a satisfying read.<br /><br />Fans of Shiver by Maggie Stiefvater will not want to miss its exciting sequel, nor will those who enjoyed Twilight by Stephenie Meyer, the A Great and Terrible Beauty trilogy by Libba Bray, and the Blue Bloods series by Melissa de la Cruz. I cannot wait for the conclusion to this awesome trilogy.

B00005MNP7|5.0|As a child I used to own this title on vinyl and remembered liking many of the songs on it. In those days I didn't rank albums according to greatness...hadn't listened to enough stuff to do that anyway. Having recently bought this title on cd (with 4 bonus tracks), I must say it strikes me as an all time great album. Never heard \\"Parallel lines\\" but reading the track listing for it never really made me think that that album was something I should get. It's good to say that nostalgia hasn't sent me astray in this case. There are no dud songs on this album. There are loads of terrific songs too boot. The rest are nothing less than interesting. Lead singer Deborah Harry is in fine form here...her voice going from charming lullabies, to screeching banshee songs. An accomplished album which is clever at times. This is the best of Blondie.      The all time classic song \\"//\\":      Atomic - has an all time great bass guitar solo and some tremendous, thwacking drums. Deb's singing is great here too.      The terrific songs \\"/\\":      Union city blue - nice drums, lovely soaring vocals by Deb - glassy at times...the way she holds those notes is a delight.    Dreaming - the opening track of the album. Has a bright/harsh sound which is indicative of the album. Not sure if the sound could be better overall. My cd was a 2001 issue. Anyway, Debbie's vocal melodic hooks really lift this song...she has two main such hooks in this song.    The hardest part - an Easter egg kind of song. Very funky vocals from Deb...a bit of reggae to it, perhaps. A narrative song with some keyboard on it. The track is bassy too...bass fairly skips along here.    Sound-a-sleep - bumped this song up in my estimation after two listens...initially gave it a dot in my scoring code but turned that into a small tick on 2nd listen. A lovely, gentle lullaby song. Triangle features, I think. Drum is almost like a heartbeat. Hearing Deb's first line brought this song back to me, all these years later.Next best \\".\\":       Eat to the beat - a high energy song. Once the catchy vocal part hit me, the memory of this song came back to me. Maybe there's an element of nostalgia here, but how often does nostalgia not hold up? Has harmonica and some bass lines at times.    Seven rooms of gloom (live) - one of four bonus tracks. Never heard this song before. Bumped it up in my convoluted code from \\"(.)\\" to \\".\\"...which has gotta be saying something, right? Again, this song has some funky elements to it...you could say that those funky parts have a Red Hot Chili Peppers vibe to them.     Die young, stay pretty - actually this is a \\"(.) song...notable for the drums. Has a reggae vibe to it. Nice vocal hooks with a good turn of phrase from Deb (\\"dried up twig on your family tree\\")...you just want to hug Deb and maybe cry a bit for her cynicism! The drum tone is tinny, but I like it in this case. There is a bonus, live version of this song too...in that Deb goes to town with her Caribbean impression. Drums have a different texture to them too, and the bass guitar sounds phat at times.      Then \\"[.]\\":      Accidents never happen - a mid-tempo song. Deb in creepy mode here, I think.  Has synthesiser. Bassy. Guitars at the start have a sort of \\"Candy\\" vibe to them...the Lou Reed song (I think...hmm). Might be the only song featuring the word \\"pre-cognition\\". Kudos right there!    Slow motion - actually marked this as \\">[.]\\"...which is slightly below the last song. A song inspired by The Supremes...it gives that 1960s black girl group a nod and a wink. Has backing singing here too...not sure if that Debbie doubling up or guest female singers.      The rest:      Shayla - contemplative guitar sounds. A slow tempo song. Has a vaguely Hawaiian vibe, perhaps. Languid and dreamy in any case.    Victor - this song really wakes you up after Deb's lullaby \\"Sound-a-sleep\\"! This song strikes me as being clever...it gives knowing nods to other music without sounding derivative. Has a Queen-ish vibe to it at times, as far as the guitars go. A little bit of the guitar riff reminds me of The Easybeats' classic \\"Sorry\\". Lyrics are occasionally primal therapy in nature...these parts are amusing. One melody here is familiar, but I can't place it.    Living in the real world - a high energy rock song. There is a vinyl scratch type sound at 1:47 ish in this song. Not sure if that is a flaw or intended. This song is a bit punk, as far as the guitar and vocals go. Made a note of \\"bomb\\", but I forget what I had in mind here.      The other bonus tracks:      Heroes (live) - a cover of the David Bowie song. I was hoping Deb would go banshee on this song, but she is quite respectful of the original...perhaps too much? Oddly, listening to this I kept thinking that were people outside talking or something when listening to it on my headphones. It's actually the backing vocals...very feint early on. You do hear some static clicks on the right hand side.    Ring of fire - a cover of the all time great Johnny Cash country song. Retains some of those country music elements, but it's a rock song.      Recommendations:      Ramones - End of the century. Their most polished and accessible album. Some terrific pop-punk here.

B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I thought this was a decent Picoult book. I usually read her novels as my \\"light\\" reading and this one proved to be exactly what I was looking for. It's not too deep or thought provoking. It has the usual Picoult-esque twist at the end. It was a quick read and generally entertaining. I do think that she could have developed the characters and potential plot devices a little better.  I enjoyed it for what it was but I thought Nineteen Minutes was the best book of hers that I've read so far.  This book was written quite a while ago and it was fun to see how far she has come as a writer when comparing this book to her more recent books.

0399156577|1.0|Wow! I must say that for a 'Nora book' this one is really a let down. I have read almost every one of her books and my first thought when encountering her potty mouth characters was \\"Who are you and what have you done with Nora?\\"     There have been several Nora books that I suspected that she had a ghost writer because the tone seems off from her usual strong writing.     The Search is amazing in that she swears more than Eddy Murphy in Beverly Hills Cop and I am not offended by profanity, but it is so not Nora's style.    Then the plot was so weak,the characters unremarkable,and that part about the vet and her vibrator really put me off. If it was an attempt at humor, she grossly missed the mark.      The dogs were the only awesome thing about the book.    However, if I wanted to read a dog book I could always get a better read out of Lassie.    I am an author and frankly was very put off by the whole composition of the book.    Better luck next time, Nora.     For those of you who loved this, did you really read the book?      Diane H.

B003QTSM4S|1.0|I loved the book so much i was sure that the movie wouldn't let me down but i was wrong. Some of my favorite parts from the book didn't even make it into the movie and some of them I feel were really essential to the plot line and were what made it so amazing. Also they changed how some of the characters were. Cheese was nothing like he was in the book which really dissapointed me because part of what i was excited to see in the movie was how they portrayed his character. All of that a side though, even if I hadn't read the book I don't think I would have liked it. I actually think I would have liked it less. It was too jumpy and it felt like I was watching some made for TV movie. I wish I could get the time I wasted watching this movie back.
1401227821|5.0|There's a great selection here spanning Adam Hughes' history of ever-more fantastic covers for DC, including some alternate takes on familiar covers, some interesting technical tidbits about how effects were achieved, as well as sketches for DC's busts and statues based on his art. Complete with wry commentary from the man himself, I'm proud to shelve this next to my Mucha and Elvgren art books.
0452295548|3.0|I enjoyed this book, but the first third or so drags a bit.  The author does a great job bringing up examples of how resilient the brain is, and how it can heal itself even when severely damaged.  The key to this seems to be through a program of repetitive learning and sticking with it long after conventional medicine would right you off.  Probably a good lesson in other areas of life as well.  There are some amazing stories of recovery in this book.  Quite inspirational to my father who suffered a stroke two months ago.
B000SEGUDE|5.0|This author presents a storyline as seen through the prisim of events which overlay one another. Starting about the time of the Ca. Gold Rush through different characters he covers time frames forward into the distant future. The unifying identification of the characters is a common birthmark.  In each time event there is a similiarity about the main character that is more than the birthmark. A common humaneness identifies this character as opposed to the selfish egotism of their antagonists. It is an interesting touch that in the bleak, barbaric future language has also deteriorited into a scarcely intelligible babble. The fragmetation of the storyline reinforces this chronicle of overlays of characters. Comic relief is available in the form of the \\"Publisher\\" but not without the pathos of ageing, a moving tenderness towards the \\"Purebloods\\" is exhibited by the \\"Fabricant\\" which has been forgotten by her creators, and the desperation of a creative musician who had been deserted by the very people who should have recognized and nurtured his talent. Cruelty sends ripples long into the lives of the yet unborn. Can we ever learn the consequences of our acts carry forward into the lives of those we love through the generations?
B000FVQLRA|5.0|This is simply the best. The Pianist is an excellent movie. Adrien really shows his storming performance as spilzman. Overall, i recommend this to everyone. A must watch movie!

B00004W50T|4.0|Have to say that this album is well worth every penny. Originally wanted it for \\"The Weight\\" but because so many reviewers said it was a MUST HAVE and it included 9 Bonus tracks decided to give it a go. NO regrets! This album really shows off the sound The Band created right from the start of their performing. No wonder they were back up for so many artists. The take on \\"Tears of Rage\\" is very different than others' recordings after this, but it stands out for the emotions in the singing that no other recording has. Love \\"The Weight\\", but it took me a long time to find out this was the title of what I thought was \\"Take A Load off\\", just shows my ignorance in the old days! \\"I Shall Be Released\\" is another great play, plus you have \\"Long Distance Operator\\", and it just goes on. This is a good introduction album and glad to add this to the collection of STANDOUT albums everyone raves about.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|Great item, its a shame that they are marked up so much and apple doesn't have inventory.  But if you want it now then you can pay the premium.    Works great, fast shipping.  New item.
B001M5UDGS|5.0|We bought this recently on Amazon.  This DVD is great fun!  It's short, it's snappy, it's fun to listen to.  We also bought the CD and listen to it in the car.  The grandkids love it, too!  The songs are witty.  I'm not going all fanboy on this; suffice to say, we enjoy it immensely.

B0038VPB5W|5.0|More and more bands are emerging in the heavy metal scene with clear influences from classic early 80's metal bands apparent in their music. Bullet For My Valentine, from Wales-UK, are one them. They've been thrown into the 'melodic metalcore' sub-genre since they first came out, largely due to their use of hard-core screaming vocals, but have said in interviews that they're a hard-rock band with metal influences.    However you wish to categorize them, they clearly have influences from thrash, hard-core, and melodic rock in their sound. The main appeal for me is the thrash sound in their guitar-work, as well as the mixed vocal style, which is always switching back and forth between melodic and screaming vocals. They can play a mean guitar solo too, and I've said several times that great guitar solos are the best way to win me over with heavy metal. Bullet For My Valentine have done so.    Bullet For My Valentine's newest album again sees them perfecting their niche within heavy metal even more. You can hear them keeping elements from all their previous works alive in their music, although I would probably say it's closest in sound & style to the Scream Aim Fire album. All the facets of their music you may have grown to love by now are present on this album, and in perfect balance. Their masterful power-ballads keep this album highly accessible for the mainstream-metal audience, but they also make sure to incorporate enough of the metalcore-screaming vocals to keep that portion of their following faithful as well.  My picks:  -Your Betrayal  -Fever  -A Place Where You Belong (this is one of the ballads, and my favorite one on this album)  -Pleasure and Pain  -Begging For Mercy    (this & other BFMV albums reviewed at:[...].)
031606792X|5.0|SO, now that I have finished this book for the second time, I must say that, I wasn't disapointed the first, and I'm even happier the second time.  See what I did with this whole series is I read the whole thing backwards.  Yet it's sound like I am crazy, but really it makes sense.      I didn't know what all the hype was about, with this team Edward and team Jacob stuff, and I really didn't care to know, (or so I thought).  But my sister who is a mother of three said I absolutely have to read these books.  So I had a friend who lent me her copy of breaking dawn, and I read.  I finished this book in about 6 hours, I am not kidding, I read the like a demon.  I was captured from the moment I read the preface of the first book.  Suddenly I knew that I was going to love the other books to.  But breaking dawn was fabulous to say the least.  I don't think Bella got everything that she wanted, I think she got more then she wanted.  I think it is a perfect ending to the perfect story, and so what if there are people out there who didn't like it.  Read the serires backwards it will do wonders for you, you will see that the change for Bella was much more then just becoming a strong vampire, it was her transformation into motherhood and her growing up, you see, there is a distinct difference between vampire bella, and human bella.  Human bella was a teenagers a young girl that was infatuated with this vampire man.  But when she becomes a vampire she is a wife, a mother, and a lover all at the same time.  If you read the serie backwards I can guarantee you would see the difference between her character.  I think Meyer did a great job through the whole series about keeping bella true to form, let's face it, Bella finally gets what she deserves, she took care of everyone for her whole life and now finally she gets to be what she's always wanted.    I don't care if ya like if or not either ;-)
B000BW7QWW|5.0|I know I did this backwards:  I wasn't really aware of \\"Firefly\\".  Then I saw \\"Serenity\\"... and now I'm watching the \\"Firefly\\" episodes.
B0000020T3|5.0|This Dave Edmunds-produced album has a dry Phil Spector-sound that works great against the electric guitar-dominated music. Half of the record is covers by gigants like The Beatles, Chuck Berry, The Lovin Spoonful, Larry Williams, Louis Armstrong(!) and Smily Lewis. And do you know what? The other half with their own songs, the powerfull titeltrack as the biggest jewel, dont slack one bit in comparison. If the album was released in 66 instead of 76 it would be regarded as equal to The Rolling Stones \\"Out Of Our Heads\\" and it sure is equaly timeless. And every time I hear the final track \\"I Cant Hide\\" I just totaly melt: PERFECT POP!
0143118420|5.0|I truly loved the people she met in Italy, India and Indonesia. I think male or female should read this.. I am pretty anxious for the movie that Julia Roberts portrays Jen Gilbert. Her story and I have a similar story after a friend's death in 2007  of course I was in mourning but I also decided to learn to love God and myself even more. I totally forgot it has taken me 3 years that I am still single  but I am just enjoying the little things....<br /><br />  Richard from Texas always spoke in bumper sticker but, always gave her good talks which Jen Gilbert winds up marrying in the next book she wrote.<br /><br />  Writing reviews are always hard because, you don't want to leave out anything but write the favorites.<br /><br />  When she arrived in Bali, it felt like an dream the way Jen described it .
B000UG78NG|3.0|I bought this book without having read a review which is unusual for me and not something I will repeat after reading this book.  The premise of the book is outstanding and the characters well developed.  Until the end......  I have never been left hanging to such an extent except from a tv series year end cliff hanger.  A STORY SHOULD STAND ALONE ON ITS OWN MERITS.  This book was just a prologue to the next in the series.  There was more foreshadowing than plot.  I am seriously disappointed.  Because I am apprehensive the same failure to publish a book that could stand alone will exist in the next book of the series, I will not be purchasing it or recommending this book to anyone else.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I was worried about how the show was going to end. Would all the hype just fade away into a mediocre ending? Thankfully the ending is faithful to the series and delivers the closure for the characters. Yes some of the islands mysteries were left unanswered, but most were. Also the ones that were left are simple and can be filled in with some thought and imagination. All of the characters are given a beautiful sendoff and leave you with complete closure for the characters. Not a single character is left without an ending. All of them are given the time and attention they deserve in this final season, and some amazing acting from the always stellar cast seals the deal. Is this the best season of Lost? No I don't think so, but it ranks number three on my list trailing season three and season one. The series finale though sits very high on my list and I find myself watching it over and over and each time I am left breathless by the beauty of the final episode and final scene in particular. The series ends on a high note, and don't let the low ratings others are giving it scare you away. If you are open minded and don't expect all the millions of mysteries to be resolved then you will enjoy the climax of the greatest saga ever written.
B002JCSWV6|4.0|This particular dvd rental lay on my sofa table for a long time before deciding to watch it. Although I did not know the story and don't know very much about rugby, I felt as though it would be somewhat predictable. Just another sports film. Wrong.<br /><br />The backdrop of regime change is well shown as well as being well told. When the new President Mandela chooses his body guards it serves as an illustration of how he wants South Africa to be. Personal conflicts have to be overcome. They are white because they are experienced, they are black because they are good at their job but few in number.<br /><br />The effects of prolonged imprisonment are also shown. The genius of a man determined to listen and to learn in order to realise his own aims is breathtaking at times. There is nothing like an open mind to undermine those who fail to think.<br /><br />The character of the glorious rugby captain is very well played, the inspiration not just from innate leadership skills but also the ability to read a game at any given moment came through in Matt Damon's performance. And the parallels with running a country are a fascinating overlap. Invictus is Nelson Mandela's story. His foresight, his inspiration; his will to win. Morgan Freeman's portrayal is convincing.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood's direction is assured, the game of rugby did not totally depend on thorough knowledge of the rules. Whether the scrums are as non verbal as shown in the film I would doubt somehow. But the idea of winning, of men winning is something to be shared by many. Perhaps this film is not for wallflowers?<br /><br />Of course such clarity of purpose comes at a cost. And the cost of family affection seems to be borne heavily on the free Mr Mandela. Freedom without responsibility is quickly mutated into greed. And with greed comes isolation. Desperation. Despair.<br /><br />The poem which seems to have lifted our incarcerated hero is overblown, heightened emotional rhetoric about being the master of your soul and master of your fate. Why do I get the feeling that he understood the English with this poem? Know your enemy.I get the feeling that he understood the English with this poem? Know your enemy.
B001KOFH2G|5.0|I WATCHED THIS MOVIE ON TV ONE NIGHT AND REALLY LIKED IT. I HATE I DIDN'T EVER WATCH THE TV SERIES(FIREFLY) THAT IT WAS BASED ON.    I DON'T WANT TO GIVE ANYTHING AWAY, I THOUGHT IT WAS REALLY A GOOD MOVIE. THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF EVERYTHING ACTION, ROMANCE AND HOW THE REAVERS WERE CREATED. IF YOU'RE A FAN OF THE TV SERIES, YOU'LL KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.  AND IF YOU'VE NEVER SEEN THE SERIES, YOU'LL JUST HAVE TO DO LIKE I DID AND BUY THE MOVIE AND THE SERIES.

0788859544|5.0|My daughters favorite movie, and I watch it with her over and over again. We love the songs and the supporting characters are wonderful. It'ssometimes a little scary for a toddler, but if mommy or daddy sits there with her, it's just fine. Perfect!
B003BKF696|5.0|i had always avoided the national for some reason.  (i could kick myself for that now....)  someone whose musical opinions/knowledge i respect suggested that i might really enjoy them, so i bought high violet.  i played it, and liked it okay--enough to leave it in rotation on the home cd player.  everytime i heard it, i liked it more and more.  eventually, it came out of the player and got shelved.  i happened upon a performance by the national on Youtube which motivated me to pull it back out and play it again.  once again, it stayed in rotation for an extended time.  who am i fooling?  it's never come back out.  needless to say, i have now gone and bought the national's entire catalog.  to think i could have been listening to this music for the last near-decade....  high violet is one of those pieces of music that creates its own unique atmosphere.  (in that sense, it reminds me of when r.e.m. first released murmur....)  it's one of those that keeps revealing new layers each time i hear it.  it's one of those that makes me replay sections, asking myself, \\"did he just say what i think he just said?\\" (in that sense, it reminds me of when the smiths released their first album....)    i know i have played it--always as a whole--more than a hundred times, and i'm still amazed and blown away by the musicianship, the lyrics, the emotions that it generates, and by the overall experience of hearing something that has held my attention since may.... at my age, it has become rarer and rarer for me to find a piece of music that does to me what high violet has done.  at this age, one doesn't expect to re-shuffle one's desert-island-discs list :-), but this cd is one that somehow i suspect i don't want to be without.
0810983915|5.0|My daughter loved the books and we will definitely order from you again. Thanks so much for the fast shipment.
B002AF4Y96|5.0|I just totally love this movie...As a photographer I am thrilled with this movie for all the different medias used, aspects of cinemaphotgraphy and overall production.  It's a classic in my opinion, a bit violent, but a movie with the title, Natural Born Killers it should be.  It has a great storyline and I love how they really expose the media for what it really does - famous for making something out of nothing.  The first time I saw this movie was in the theatre and I came out just awe struck.  Now it is on Blue Ray and I can see it over and over in High Def and everytime I watch it, I see or learn, some new little detail that adds to the plot and storyline.  If you like action packed movies with big name actors (Woody Harelson, Tommy Lee Jones, Robert Downey Jr. and more), and you like to see films that are a quite artistic and a little different, then this is a must for your Blue Ray collection.  Also, using Nine Inch Nails as the main musical artist for this film is perfect - Treant Raznor is a genius.  Definately a Oliver Stone masterpiece!
B00003CX9W|4.0|Bought this for my 1 year old daughter.  It is an excellent way to introduce children to music.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|I'd write what it was about, but enough of the other reviews have already done that.  So...    This was, hands down, the best film I have seen in years.  The acting was superb, the story was gripping, and the scenery was beautiful.  I highly recommend this movie.  It was very real and down to earth, a nice change from all the flashy special effects stuff that is constently coming out.  I left the theater feeling refreshed and will definitely be purchasing this film when it is available on DVD.
B0011FXLCC|5.0|This is almost the opposite of Felt Mountain, but both albums are very similar. This is a return to form in a way because of the strings and the atmosphere.But Felt Mountain was more depressing, lonely, and dark. This one is more warm and mellow.  An amazing album nonetheless.  Probably my second favorite by Goldfrapp, after Felt Mountain of course.
0061743526|5.0|For those worried that this is a sub par edition, please take the negative reviews with a grain of salt. The decorative design is called deckle edge and the pages are designed to look handmade. The pages are high quality and this hardback edition is beautifully done.     This is a great second copy for those of you who want a beautiful hardback to replace the copy you read as a young student.    For those who have not read it, the book is one of the best ever. A must read.
0802798225|5.0|I want to start this review by saying that I LOVED this book! I could not put it down and the same was true for the follow up \\"Rules of Attraction,\\" but I will get to that later...lol. Anyways...    Brittany Ellis is perfect in every way. Or at least that's what she has led everyone to believe. The truth is that her life is anything but perfect. Britney's façade is the only thing protecting her from her problems at home and it's threatened when she gets stuck with Alex Fuentes as a lab partner in chemistry. Alex is wrong for her in every way but she soon finds out that he is not who he appears to be and maybe she is not the only one hiding who she really is.    Alex is a gang member from the other side of town. Alex takes pride in his bad boy persona but at home he is just trying to protect and support his family the best way he can. When a friend and fellow gang member makes a bet that Alex can't get \\"Perfect Britney Ellis\\" to sleep with him, Alex thinks nothing of the challenge. That is, until he realizes that there is much more to Britney then she lets anyone else see.    The rest of the story is comprised of their struggle to follow their heart or stick with the path that has been laid out for them. Simone Elkeles has delivered an amazing story! The story is told from both Brittany and Alex's perspective so the reader always know how the other person is feeling even if Britney and Alex haven't quite figured it out yet. Read it! You'll love it!   [...]
B000E1ZBGS|4.0|This version of Pride and Predjudice is an excellent one.  The music tied well with the movie and the actors/actresses all did a wonderful job of portraying the characters.  The reason I gave it only 4 stars though is because there were scenes in the older film version (from 1995 I believe) with Colin Firth that I would have loved to seen in this movie.  Also, the character of Mr. Darcy in this version didn't really have much to say which was disappointing.  Despite these two faults this is still a movie I will watch over and over again.
B003UYUR10|5.0|I don't know what movie one of the other reviewers saw, but it certainly wasn't the same one I saw. I thought it was excellent & no I am not a fangirl or fanboy, I have just been a movie buff my whole life. I thought Gyllenhaal did a great job considering he did most of his own stunts & looked very much like the PoP video game character. Plus he brought a lot of wit & charm to the character & there was quite a bit of chemistry between him & Gemma who was exquisitely beautiful, wonderful, & feisty as Tamina.  My only problem with this movie is there won't be a sequel since the US did not embrace this movie like they did overseas. However, it was fun, exciting, had beautiful cinematography with the Moroccan landscapes & deserts. The only CGI special effects were the turn back time sequences, & a few other places with the sand glass. It had quite a few teaching moments too, which makes it a great family film & for kids of all ages to enjoy. Bruckheimer movies are always big budget flicks & it shows in every way. There definitely was no cutting corners here, you could really tell. One more thing I want to add is the Parkour stunts were beautifully choreographed, that was an excellent idea to get David Belle to teach Gyllenhaal the art of Parkour, so they looked real. FYI to you naysayers, there is such a thing as suspension of disbelief & a good imagination that one must have to thoroughly lose yourself in a fantasy type movie as this is so you can enjoy it for what it is, otherwise, you waste the whole movie thinking about the stunts & events in it are impossible & illogical.
0525423842|3.0|The ending came so fast and so incomplete. It left me with so many question.  Fast reading.
0441013074|4.0|I am a big Alistair Reynolds fan and I enjoyed this book a lot. It is rather different to his Revelation Spaces series (Chasm City is, for me, his best work), but the inventiveness of the ideas is well up to the usual standards.  It does have a few points that could be improved, but it is certainly more readable than most of the other reviewers seem to think, at least in my opinion. His invocation of an alternate Paris of 1959 is sport on.  I particularly appreciated his mention of the Pont de Concorde in the first line as I bought the book about 200m from that bridge!  I doubt there is a sequel in the works, but I really would like to know what happens next in the Paris of Wendell Floyd.
0439023483|5.0|I won't bore everyone with a play by play of the plot, but I will say, that this is a brilliant start to one of the best series I have come across in a long time. I read it in one sitting, and immediately bought the boxed set (coming in August). I go back and forth between excited, happy, amazed and then almost to tears at different parts... sometimes within moments. I would highly recommend this book and series to everyone!

B00076POJY|5.0|The movie Who Framed Roger Rabbit is famous for many reasons : It was a film that combined actors with cartoon characters. It featured Disney icons alongside their Warner Brothers counterparts.<br /><br />But Roger Rabbit is perhaps equally as infamous for the racy urban legends surrounding the film.<br /><br />When Jessica is riding a taxi through Toon Town with Bob Hoskins, the taxi crashes into a lamppost, sending both of them flying out of the car. Jessica lands spinning and her dress begins hiking up her body. Hidden in just a few frames--in other words, unnoticeable while playing the movie in its normal speed--Jessica's underwear seems to disappear, briefly leaving her exposed.<br /><br />Was this an error in the coloring process, or was this a gag perpetrated by an animator working on the film? No one can say for sure, kids. This one stays a mystery.<br /><br />Another rumor surrounding Roger Rabbit that has yet to be substantiated concerns Disney CEO Michael Eisner.<br /><br />In the scene where Bob Hoskins goes into a bathroom in Toon Town, graffiti on the wall reads : \\"For a good time, call Allyson Wonderland... \\"The Best Is Yet to Be.\\" The second phrase was supposedly replaced with Eisner's phone number in a single frame. But this did not show up in the laser-disc version of the film, and may have only been hidden in the theatrical version.<br /><br />The only Urban Legend in Roger Rabbit that can actually be validated is a scene in which Baby Herman walks off of the set and sticks his middle finger up in the air just before going underneath a woman's dress. Herman then emerges with a spot of drool on his upper lip.  Hmm... What could he have been doing?

B0015DROBO|1.0|Couldn't agree more with some of the \\"1 star\\" reviews like this one:<br /><br />I thought this was a terrible book. Bad enough to take the time to give it a review.<br /><br />Most books I can understand the hysteria around them, even if I don't personally like it. This book is an exception. Graphic violent sexually abuse, descriptions of pointless meals, and heap loads of history on a boring family, helpless women that don't seem to do anything about their problems, and multiple side stories and characters that don't contribute in any way. Even if it was written beautifully, how could this be interesting?!<br /><br />I picked this up since it was all over the best seller lists and what a lousy excuse for a book.<br /><br />NOTHING seemed to happen, except for a few pages near the end, which didn't make any sense at that point since I was skim reading the book after about pg 150. The characters are not interesting at all, very stereotypical. Genius hacker, skinny, outcast girl, and the irresistible journalist who seems more worried about his sex life than solving any 'mystery.'<br /><br />So to summarize the book-<br />Journalist man does something trivial, genius chick is explained as not being a genius, but challenged, random sexual encounter, coffee and sandwiches(I wish I could do a search for this one for an actual count), description of clothes and financial/family history documents, repeat this pattern every 30 pages for the next 600!!!! pages.<br /><br />I could cut the book some slack and blame it on the translation, but if the guy translated coffee and sandwich scenes that many times, they must have been in the original.<br /><br />The editors need to take a chainsaw to this book, it could have been 400 pages shorter and the same amount of actual stuff that happened would not have been affected.

B002ZG980U|5.0|Step into surrealistic dreaming where people can go into your dreams and steal all your secrets to use against you.  This is one of the facets of THE INCEPTION WORLD.  Unlike a lot of summer movies that start with an interesting idea this movie doesn't drop the ball and it even ends the tale in an open ended fashion which has people discussing it all over the world.  SciFi types familiar with this sub genre should be able to pick the gist up without much attention but other people really need to pay attention or they're going to become confused.  Arguably the best summer movie of 2010.  MY GRADE: A minus to A.

B000000WFZ|5.0|This is possibly the most beautiful soundtrack ever composed for film, and a couple of the pieces can only be described as transcendent.  While The Mission is a wonderful film, I am sure much of its soundtrack will long outlive the film and may achieve musical immortality.
B003N5VOUO|3.0|I had high expectations for this film and I must say it didn't disappoint. It's not your average Bollywood song and dance family melodrama that we have come to expect from Karan Johar but he does a very nice job of putting into context the animosity and discrimination directed towards Muslims post-911. Shah Rukh Khan does a good job of playing his character. I am not familiar with Asperger Syndrome so I am not sure how people would act or react to others and situations given their circumstances. So I wonder if SRK went over the top as usual? I was disappointed with Kajol's performance. She too over plays her characters and comes off looking and sounding annoying. They make a good on screen couple but I think she is way overrated as a Bollywood actress. I like her when she is subdued. Her voice irritates me when she gets excited (which is most of the time in most of her films) but she improved slightly closer to the end of the film. I think one of her better roles was in the movie, Fanaa with Amir Khan. But as far as My Name is Khan goes, kudos to Mr. Johar for approaching this timely topic with a great deal of sensitivity and heart. Job well done.
0307454541|4.0|Dry at first, but the introduction of the Lisbeth character hooked me. The book is well written with plot points that conclude in an a-typical and therefore refreshing way. The violence is both creepy and cold - suspenseful, but detached and journalistic. This speaks to Larsson's background as a journalist, I suppose. I enjoyed the book, read it very quickly, and will pick up the second in the series.

B00005Q66M|5.0|This one crushes the competition.  OK.  You can probably throw out Lady Starlight, but the rest is pure-D 80's rock and roll.    The Zoo and Make it Real are still part of their stage show in 2010... 30 years later.      This one is best LOUD!
B001EN71CW|5.0|For anyone who's seen Firefly before then nuff said. You all know that it's a criminal shame that the show only lasted 13 episodes. A peculair combination of the Western and Sci-Fi genres that really works. Some of the best writing Joss and his crew have ever done, some great acting and characters. Top show.     As a UK resident for some reason we don't have Firefly on blu-ray so I took the plunge and ordered it from the US. I was a little concerned as the blu-ray is in NTSC while we watch stuff in PAL over here. However I don't really think it made any difference to picture quality. It looks great, the extras are nice - the cast lunch is entertaining. Basically it's the same great show but in a nicer format and taking up less space on your shelf.    It also took a ridiculously short time to come over to the UK and I somehow avoided paying UK customs duty on it (it was just under the value bracket miraculously!)    Any yes the blu rays do play on the UK players.
B002ZG9788|2.0|First let me say that I am rarely one to complain about an old movie, even a classic movie, getting a modern day makeover. I see negative reviews of remakes based alone on the feeling that some movies are sacred and should never be messed with. I say if you can take a classic and make it even better, then by all means have at it. This 2010 version of Clash of the Titans fails at making the 1981 version better and maybe was worth looking at only because of its cool CGI effects.<br /><br />I'd have been completely satisfied if fledgling Director Louis Leterrier took the 1981 original story word for word and simply re-did it with updated FX. While he did indeed pay homage to the 1981 version in many respects, it seems he got lost more in creating cool looking FX and abandoning the perfect story flow that the original had. Adding certain aspects to the story could have been interesting if it all made sense, but for me it just didn't make sense and seemed to jump all over the place.<br /><br />And then there was the acting, or should I say lack thereof. It didn't seem to me that Sam Worthington who played Perseus or Liam Neeson who played Zeus took their roles seriously at all. They came across as two A-listers making cameos versus lead actors giving A-list performances. This combined with the uneven storytelling really took a lot out of the movie for me.<br /><br />I was never even a fan of Greek Mythology until seeing the original Clash back in the 80s. After that movie I not only became interested in Greek Mythology, I felt I now actually knew something about it...like I just had a very clear and concise lesson in it. After the 2010 Clash, I felt the same way I did after the recent [[ASIN:B000NTPDT6 Transformers]]...like I'd just seen a lot of cool FX with little substance to the story.<br /><br />So my recommendation is to pick up the [[ASIN:B000Q7ZOL2 the 1981 original version]] and pass on this 2010 version until it comes out on cable. As dated as Ray Harryhausen's stop-motion effects will look in the 1981 version, you'll walk away from it with a much more entertaining and even educating experience. And if you're just looking for some mythological fun I'd say get yourself a [[ASIN:B002I0J4VQ PlayStation 3]] and spend countless hours with the [[ASIN:B002NN7AKU God of War Collection]].n the 1981 version, you'll walk away from it with a much more entertaining and even educating experience. And if you're just looking for some mythological fun I'd say get yourself a [[ASIN:B002I0J4VQ PlayStation 3]] and spend countless hours with the [[ASIN:B002NN7AKU God of War Collection]].
0307454541|4.0|Many other reviewers' have covered the plot so I'll refrain from that, but I will say this is a very good read!<br />  The central mystery, its investigation and solving (p. 200-2350), is more like a subplot to the real story of the book. The best parts of the book are everything else, the characterization of Lisbeth, Post Cold War financial frauds and the day-to-day running of a magazine.  The only irksome thing with the book is the absolute blandness of the protagonist and the fact that every woman in the book wants to sleep with this milquetoast.
030745455X|1.0|Disclosure -- I did not finish this book. But, then again, that's why I'm writing this review. If I may be abrupt, the plot is a total mess with side excursions that lead nowhere and back. The action is all told in backstory until probably (I didn't finish it) the finale. The characters, and not just the villains, are truly unlikeable and unlikely.<br /><br />While I have no problems with an author's omniscient point of view, I find it implausible when a character is omniscient. A passing glance at a couple and our heroine reads the future like it was written yesterday. She has more money than God and apparently more time on her hands also. She's a tortured, snarling mess so convinced of her own superioity that she never questions it. She has reason to be spiteful of course and this would explain her misandry -- but nothing can explain the novel's utter contempt for males of the species. All, of course, except for our three-timing Swedish meatball hero.<br /><br />Maybe Danny Craig can save it. Wait for the movie.

0091922348|5.0|I have so many cookbooks some might see it as ridiculous I buy yet another...but this one is really quite special. This book is very inspiring. Nice pictures,  they really bring the dishes to life. However, it's the inventive, thoughtful combination of ingredients that just blow me away. Seriously, I just look at the picture of the green bean and pea dish and 20 other variations pop in my head. I am not a recipe follower too often, mostly I just read and then start chopping whatever is in the kitchen. I heartily recommend it even though I have barely read through 15 pages. The authors are VERY specific in their cooking directions in a really good way.  They also like their veggies a bit on the crunchy side for our family's taste, but that is simple to change. I wish it was in paperback so it was easier to read in bed.
9889979942|5.0|I was drawn to Tom Carter's work after reading an Amazon list description he'd written that indicated a deeper understanding of Asian culture and society. I was compelled to buy this book after seeing that, unlike the coffee table books with sweeping views of rice paddies and mist-covered mountains, China: Portrait of a People focuses on a close-up and intimate look at the many cultures and ethnicities across all of China.    Carter traveled through 33 provinces and documented his journey with incredible one-of-a-kind photos of the young, the old, city folk, and rural villagers. I spent hours flipping through the pictures. They are not all pretty -- there are startling images of poverty and hardship. The gap between the standard of living in different areas of the country can be clearly seen. Yet there is a raw beauty to it all through the unfiltered lens of Carter's camera.     The pictures show people living their everyday lives. You see them in the streets, by the rivers, in nightclubs and in temples. We get to peek into the myriad of encounters big and small that must make up such a journey. The resounding message is that the Chinese people are a vast mix of distinct cultures and histories and China is a world onto itself. I have already revisited the book several times. The images are ones that stay with you and I feel privileged to experience this incredible adventure vicariously through Tom Carter's eyes.       --Jeannie Lin, author of \\"[[ASIN:0373296142 Butterfly Swords (Harlequin Historical)]]\\"
B00003CXSM|1.0|I purchased the DVD, \\"The Wedding Planner\\" from Wichita-BuyBacks in June it arrived broken or cracked on the center hole.  I have written three E-Mails concerning the problem.  I have not received a response to my problem or complaint. I think that the DVD should be replaced and shipped to me at no cost. I am clearly frustrated, and feel taken advantage of my trust in doing business with a company over the internet.  I feel a month is adequate time to have resolved the problem.    I am not a negative person, and I feel bad for complaining. I expect to receive the service and good business that was promised.
B003HFFVEA|3.0|The Chemical Brothers and I have had this sort of \\"long term relationship\\" that started back with the \\"big beats\\" sound of \\"Exit Planet Dust\\" and I'm very happy with all the hours we've spent together.  I've scoured the internet for every track I didn't already own and have purchased nearly every CD, EP, and single they've released.  In other words, I'd like to think I'm a huge fan.      Where this leaves me is in a disconnect with other reviewers regarding this album.  It's extremely creative and definately a departure of where they've been heading over the last two studio LP's (\\"We Are the Night\\" and \\"Push The Button\\").  But to me, it's not better.  It's not even near showing us what they're capable of producing.  Maybe it's \\"evolving\\", maybe it's aging, maybe it's pushing the genre.  I don't know. Overall the album turns out to be kind of a snoozer to me.  I never really get fully into it like I have so many of their others.      When \\"Escape Velocity\\" link was delivered in the e-mail, I just was like \\"WTF\\"?  It's a song that could make it's point in 4 or 5 minutes but chooses to drag it out.  I like it and it's cool to sit back and listen to it at a medium volume, but after 20 listens it's worn on me, and that's not how our \\"relationship\\" has historically been.  \\"Swoon\\" ended up being the first real \\"single\\" of the album and is definately the best song.  Probably not making my top 10 list, but pretty good.  \\"Snow\\" takes some getting used to, but turns out OK.  \\"Another World\\" starts kind of funky, but picks up.  I like this track.  \\"Dissolve\\" is another one that doesn't really do enough to get me feeling either way.  \\"Horse Power\\" is the stuff and is more like The Chemical Brothers I know.  I can do without animal sounds in my music but it almost works here - almost.  \\"K+D+B\\" is another near yawner and is the weakest song on the album.  At least they keep the album set up consistant and put a nice \\"chill\\" song to close it out with \\"Wonders of the Deep\\".      Theaccompanying DVD is certainly not worth any additional cost.  It's pretty useless to me.  It's more computer generated visuals than anything like videos or the like.  If you need it or want it just keep the expectations very low.      So overall I like the side of The Chemical Brothers that isn't shown much this time around. Stuff like the Electronic Battle Weapons, the harder beat \\"breakbeat\\" sounds, and songs \\"Not Another Drugstore\\" and \\"Get Yourself High\\" to name just a couple.  One thing is for sure, The Chemical Brothers next album will be different than this one.  I'll get by until then.  We're just going to be \\"seeing other people\\" in the meantime.  XOXOXO
B0036S4CTS|4.0|I'm glad I read ONE DAY, the new novel by David Nicholls.  Nicholls is funny, a witty writer.  This story follows twenty years in the intersecting lives of a young man and a young woman who \\"romantically collide\\" the day after their commencement from a British university.  They leave the university, but never really leave each other's lives, despite the events and other people who keep coming between them. It sounds like chick-lit, and in a few places feels like it.  But Nicholls is good, and this book rises above that genre.  The characters are richly drawn and convincing, even though I felt at times that nobody is as consistently good as Emma or as consistently disappointing as Dex.  Nicholls's work reminds me of Tom Perotta's novels -- intelligent, sharply observed, thoughtful, and wry.
B003O86FMW|5.0|There is nothing I could possibly add to the hundreds of other reviews here praising this book (and this series), so all I can do is just throw my recommendation on the pile. This series is some of the most engrossing and original storytelling I've read in a LONG time (and I read a LOT). This is not my normal type of reading, but a friend recommended them, and I'm so glad I listened. These are AWSOME books! Lucky for me, Mockingjay comes out in 3 weeks, but I have no idea how some of these people have been able to wait almost a YEAR for the final book! I can't wait to get my hands on it! It's already been pre-ordered, so now I'm just counting down the days. If you're at all interested in reading this, the almost 500 positive reviews should be a pretty clear sign...READ IT!! You'll love it!
B003L0V758|5.0|Bits of Earth Wind & Fire and Stevie Wonder's epic sci-fi prophet feel, sometimes Bowie-punk (even fleeting reminders of the Violent Femmes, prog-rock and experimental albums of the 60s and 70s), Grace Jones, James Brown, old crooners.  Many other influences I can't put my finger on or simply don't know.  Sweeping, energetic and tight.  Definitely elements that are very theatrical, fantastical, exploratory and intelligent.  Things change up between songs and even within songs - not an album full of songs that all have the same sound/mood/style.<br /><br />I am loving this album and am wishing and searching for more music like it NOW.  But there isn't much like it out there.  I actually found myself wishing a long-departed musician friend could hear this.  I know it would be a favorite, and that he would have wanted to share it with everyone and organize a road trip to the nearest tour stop.  I'm looking up tour dates myself.

B002BU0DPE|2.0|Let me start off by saying that the PX21s have decent sound quality. Better than the TV. The build of the headset is feels pretty cheap overall. Does it feel heavy on your head? After an hour or two you will start to feel the headset clamping down on your head (mostly your ears) and you'll want to take it off. The control module (where you control the chat volume/game volume/bass/etc.) has a clip, and that pretty much snaps if you drop it, cheap. They say you won't disturb anyone while wearing these; that's only half correct. Sometimes I just use the headset for game sound instead of the TV. When you turn up the volume on the headset, others will hear it. I doesn't isolate the sound very well, even when I am wearing it. If I knew it was going to be like this I wouldn't have bought it in the first place. I think $80 dollars is a bit overpriced for the weekend gamer. Now, the sound quality? It's decent, like I said, better than the TV. If your playing a shooter game you'll be able to hear somebody sneaking up on you. The microphone boom feels very plasticy. The sound quality of the mic is once again, decent. Now let's get to the pros and cons.<br /><br />Pros<br />- Decent sound quality<br />- Decent microphone quality<br />- Good bass... BOOM<br />- Appealing design<br />- You won't disturb anyone while your playing.. unless you have the volume of the headset turn all the way up<br />- Pretty easy to set up (less than 10 minutes)<br />- Long cords, 20 ft. +<br /><br />Cons<br />- Ears hurt after about an hour (Feels like headset is clamping down on you)<br />- Overall quality feels cheap<br />- Microphone boom feels cheap<br />- Sound control module clip breaks easy<br /><br />[UPDATE 2/14/11]<br />The left (L) side now has no sound, this is due to bad wiring. I know this because If I bend the cables a certain way, the sound comes back and it I release it, the sound goes away. These headphones have made me better, but not by much anymore, considering that I can only hear from my right ear. I mostly use it for in-game chatting now.<br /><br />I wonder if this product comes with a 1-year warranty or something...

B001CN2WXM|5.0|There are several films that grabbed my attention when they first came out that I probably overrated in the 1990s (an overrated decade for movies) simply because of their immediate appeal, impact, and recognition. Then I have to go back and REALLY watch the film again to see if it is truly great and holds up over time. Thankfully, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL (1997) is one of those 90s films that still holds up and resonates! A cool, precise, confident tale of corruption in early 1950s Hollywood, L.A. CONFIDENTIAL is probably one of the top 5 film noirs ever made. It's one of the very few times when the number of Academy Award nominations (9 total) seemed truly warranted. CONFIDENTIAL won 2 of it's 9 awards (Best Adapted Screenplay and Best Supporting Actress-Kim Basinger). It should have won Best Picture and Director (Curtis Hanson) too!     L.A. CONFIDENTIAL stars Russell Crowe, Kevin Spacey, and Guy Pearce (as, respectively, Officer Bud White, and Sergeants Jack Vincennes and Ed Exley), 3 cops caught up in a web of corruption to varying degrees within their police precinct. Vincennes is a fame-seeking vice cop who supplies a major smut magazine photojournalist (played with unabashed slimy appeal by Danny Devito) with the inside track on his narc busts of semi-famous Hollywood celebs; Vincennes also has a primo gig as the consultant on a popular TV cop show. Exley is a clean-cut, moralistic desk sergeant who refuses to compromise his ideals in order to convict criminals, even if he knows they are guilty. White is a tough-as-nails street smart cop who will do what it takes to nail  criminals, even if it means breaking the law himself.     These 3 sides of the cop triangle (who dislike each other for various reasons) find themselves unwittingly thrown together when a mass murder is committed in a local diner and one of the victims is White's long-time partner Dick Stenslund and another is a high-class call girl Sue Lefferts who worked for major smut peddler Pierce Patchett (confidently played by David Strathairn). The precinct is tasked by their boss, Captain Dudley Smith (superbly played by James Cromwell) to solve the case. White has the most clues as he and Stenslund had had an encounter on Christmas Eve with Patchett, Lefferts, Patchett's scummy bodyguard Buzz Meeks (who Stenslund seemed to recognize), and another of Patchett's call girls Lynn Bracken (the aforementioned Kim Basinger in an sultry, straightforward performance).    Although the plot on the surface seems as convoluted as all get out, it is surprisingly simple and you'll find yourself putting the pieces together as the film moves along. What really still impresses me about CONFIDENTIAL is how fresh and involving the dialogue still is. It never gets old no matter how many times I hear it. And even knowing the big reveal of the film doesn't detract from how engrossing it is. Not to mention, the acting by the 3 leads is truly top-notch. Crowe (THE INSIDER, GLADIATOR-Best Actor, A BEAUTIFUL MIND), Spacey (AMERICAN BEAUTY-Best Actor), and Pearce (MEMENTO) all went on to star individually in these highly acclaimed films, but for some reason, I find their characters in this film more watchable than the ones they portrayed in those. I think a huge key was that all of these actors were essentially newcomers (except for Spacey, who still was making his mark at the time), so that it doesn't come across as big movie star casting gimmicks. It makes the uneasiness with which these 3 men interact seem all the more authentic in the film.     The story and plot of L.A. CONFIDENTIAL pulls you in immediately and never lets up until the final act. The characters are so vividly drawn and progress in a way that you really find yourself connecting with them on some level. Even though L.A. CONFIDENTIAL may be adapted from a piece of \\"fiction\\", by the end of the film, you really feel like you've gained insight not only about police tactics, but just about people in general. May be set in the 1950s, but L.A. CONFIDENTIAL has a universal and timeless appeal that will always be prescient.
B001HN694K|2.0|Lewis Carrol's original \\"Alice in Wonderland\\", despite being more on the bizarre side and not having a real plot, was an entertaining and charming book, as I remember it from high school. When I heard Tim Burton was adapting it, I thought it was perfect for him, given his love of doing bizarre movies like \\"Big Fish\\", \\"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\\", and \\"Beetlejuice\\". However, this movie failed my expectations.    Burton takes a classic tale and gives it a modern storyline and mixes it up with other of Lewis' works (such as the White Queen and the Jabberwocky). Basically, Alice has grown up and is reluctant to marry the man people want her to. While she wanders off to think, she falls down a rabbit hole and makes her way into \\"Underland\\", where she visited years before when she was a child. Then, like your typical, predictable story, Alice discovers she is the prophesied one who will kill the Jabberwocky and restore the White Queen to the throne of Underland. Besides an unoriginal plot, the movie failed in other ways. The characters were bizarre and nothing truly memorable, and most of the ones from the original story had very little screen time and little part to play in the story. In short, it came across as a poorly done film.

B001ILFUDM|5.0|I just finished seeing Pinocchio on Blu-Ray, and I am amazed.  This movie is older than Citizen Kane, but it looks like a dream.  I understand some people have claimed the colors have been tampered with.  It is true that there was a sepia tone to the VHS and previous DVD, that is now gone.  Whether that sepia tone was truly the original look of the film, I am not old enough or knowledgeable enough to say.  What I do know is that the movie looks fantastic on Blu-Ray, as if it was made yesterday (though hand-drawn animation of this quality is rare these days), and I commend Disney on that.    Of course, I would not be giving a Blu-Ray five stars simply for the image quality.  Many claim that Pinocchio is one of Disney's best feature films, if not the best.  Unfortunately, I haven't seen many Disney feature films since the '90s when I was a kid, so I can't really compare Pinocchio to anything but fuzzy memories.  But I did greatly enjoy Pinocchio.  The animation is unbelievable, and the hand-painted backgrounds look wonderful.  The characters are hilarious and charming.  The story is of course the classic Pinocchio story based on the 1883 novel, a kind of dark morality tale, really, what with the child slavery element.    This is a perfect movie for kids, but adults should definitely watch it as well.  The animation is both technically and artistically exquisite, and the movie as a whole has a charm to it that is truly special.

B00005K3LU|5.0|If there's action star I've not mentioned it would be Bruce Wills I've loved this movie since 96 or 97 Die Hard is an action classic that stars Bruce Wills as New York City Cop John McClane Bonnie Belinda stars as Holly Genero McClane his wife & Reginald Vel Johnson as LA cop Sargent Al Powell. The Plot is straight forward & brilliant at the same time. John McClane is going to see Holly cause she accepted a job there which has a lot of hæ** in the marriage. So there's a party going on at the Nakitomi towers where Holly works at some Terrorist's led by Hans Gruber & they really crash the party take some hostages & send The Police & FBI on a wild goose chase making them think it's about political prisoners. Meanwhile John doesn't go in guns ablazing he outsmarts them taking them out 1 by 1. I like how the characters are developed the fight scenes are great effects are too as is the stunt work. Some cool facts Bruce Wills & Demi Moore got marred during filming. Richard Gere was considered for the role of McClane that would have been terrible so was Richard Dean Anderson & Don Johnson. So was Burt Reynolds seriously!? This was also planned to be Commando 2. Ok Die Hard is a great movie if you don't have it don't rent if buy it & put it in your collection.
B001PPGAJE|4.0|I  got it as part of a 2 pack somewhere else but its good I still wander why they made it on a two layer disc when it could have been done on one layer since a blueray disc has much more room than a standard disc and instead of it being a 2 disc set it could have both discs on one disc.
B003INBOEM|5.0|4.5 stars<br /><br />Ip Man not only has some of the best kung fu footage I've ever seen, as in Enter The Dragon good, but delivers a decent movie alongside the action. Yen is a fine actor as well as an insanely talented marital artist; his taciturn performance as Ip Man feels perfect in many ways, but never cheesy as so much of this genre can be.<br /><br />There are also some beautiful shots by director Yip, and a few of the early scenes are played almost slapstick, which works well and gives way to straight drama as the plot moves forward. Chinese hatred towards the Japanese occupiers is still palpable, and there is a touch of propaganda feel here. But all in all, the amazing action combines with a surprisingly gentle touch throughout, along with a fine score (if derivative...count the Bond and other cues) and excellent cinematography, to create a real martial arts classic.
B00005JM02|5.0|When the movie came in 2003 everyone knew it was going to be good but it surpass everything. It broke records it was considered the best movie in 2003 and trust me it is.

B003ODL004|3.0|I like the \\"Inception\\" soundtrack much better than the film itself, but I still think the score is lacking. Most of the tracks are super moody and melancholy. Only a few of them contain that strong, pulsating music that drove the entire movie. While those tracks are exceptional, most of the other music is so incredibly soft and subtle that I could barely even hear it while listening to it on my car stereo. Still, the tracks that are good are really, REALLY good, which is why I give the album three stars.
B00005Y7LD|5.0|Billy is a Pop Rocker of magnificent scope. Charmed Life is another marterpiece by Billy and his talented band. His depth into the realm of rock shows as he does his Doors into L.A.

B002KSPKRS|1.0|The first thing I noticed was how UGLY, clunky and cheap-looking these things are! They are HUGE and look and feel like a cheap toy! The smallest headband setting is still too large for the average adult head and fits very loosely. I hoped that at least the performance would make up for the cheap ugly non-fitting headphones! WRONG!! There is a constant hiss in the background, and very loud POPPING whenever you move or try to walk with them on. Also, be prepared to go through a pair of batteries every 3-5 hours of use. After 3-5 hours, the popping and hissing escalates to an unbearable level. Also, when playing a game like Modern Warfare 2, people are always telling me my mic is making loud squealing noises. I can't believe Turtle Beach released these with so many issues!! I had to cut open the plastic packaging in order to get the headphones out to use, and now can't return them!! Don't waste your money on these horrible headphones!! I believe Turtle Beach should be sued in a class action lawsuit because they have SCREWED tons of customers with these expensive crappy headphones!!

B002CLBJPK|2.0|I was thrilled when this first appeared on DVD and bought it instantly.  The promise of an \\"extended cut\\" was exciting as I had first seen this film in its initial release and played the soundtrack album to death.  I never questioned why there were songs on the soundtrack which didn't appear in the film because \\"thematically\\" the songs \\"fit.\\"    I was primed to like this release.    What never even entered my mind was that they would undertake to redub the dialogue for the extended scenes for actors who have since passed away.  Now Disney, who is zealous about the replacement voices for their animated characters, spent little time, effort or money on matching the voices of the live action actors in this film.  They are HORRIBLE.  It's almost as if they asked the receptionist to put on her best accent and read the line.  Mrs. Hobday is the worst.  I find it hard to believe that even the slightest search for a vocal match wouldn't have yielded something better.  In fact, picking a name out of the phone book would have yielded better results.  They have taken the performances of great character actors and made them look buffoonish with alien voices supplied by accent and acting-challenged individuals.      If you treasure this film, as I do, hold out for a \\"not-so-special edition!\\"
9889979942|5.0|Having lived in Asia for 5 years and in China for the past 2 years (in Shanghai) I obviously come to Tom Carter's China: Portrait of a People with more than a simple layman's interest.  I chose to live in China at this time because I wanted to experience first hand the remarkable (re)emergence and rapid change of a people and a nation.  Few nations offer as much panoramic scope and such a vivid canvas as China.  It is a study in extremes, from the glittering megacities of the future like Shanghai and Shenzhen, to the exotic minority cultures in Tibet, Yunnan and elsewhere, to the agrarian, grinding life of the average Chinese farmer that has remained largely unchanged for millennia, Tom Carter has captured it all.  His keen eye has served him well in going beyond the usual 'postcard' images one so often sees of China, to capturing the unexpected and revealing images that tell one so much about modern China.  To take just one example, punks in China, who knew?! Well all of who live here for one, but since that doesn't neatly fit the cliche image of China most foreigners expect in movies and images, you don't see it much.  (Don't worry though, there are plenty of gorgeous, stunning photos of the 'postcard' variety that you'd expect in a book this size about China.)       Perhaps the most important quality Carter brings to this project is that most precious of resources: time.  Plenty of photographers or photojournalists may come to China to take some great pictures, but few, if any, have devoted the 2 years and thousands of miles that Tom Carter has.  Others books might try to mimic the scope of China: Portrait of a People by combining the work of dozens of photographers but there is unmistakably something to be gained by seeing this vast nation through the eyes of a single artist and his vision; Carter brings a unity of vision and a hard-earned eye for what makes China tick that no casual visitor could hope for.     China is the unavoidable nation in the 21st century.  It is no longer simply a topic for adventure-seeking travelers or businessmen and diplomats.  Even if you have never been to China or know little about it, it is affecting your life in ways large and small.  And it will surely only do so more in the years ahead.  So do yourself and those around you a favor and start learning more about it now.  Tom Carter's China: Portrait Of A People is a fine place to start - or continue - peeking behind the silk curtain at this fascinating country.  And unlike a dry foreign affairs book, this book has the added bonus of teaching you about China while providing a feast for the eyes with its lush visual spectacle.  I enthusiastically give it the (semi) Official Lao Wai Seal of Approval.

B00013RC8O|1.0|I LIKE car movies, but this script was JUST awful. Boring. My buddy thought so too. We both like Cleavon Little (Blazing Saddles) and wanted to like this film.<br /><br />Minus the nude girl on the Honda 250 (I think) there's not much here to watch.<br /><br />Go rent \\"Christine\\" (from the Stephen King book). MUCH better script, MUCH better movie, and you not only get LOTS of 58 Fury shots, BUT there's a late 60's Charger AND a 68 Camaro. Close your eyes when they bash the Fury to death and squash the Camaro in the gas station.<br /><br />Also you get the gorgous Leigh. Who is still gorgeous today, I hear.<br /><br />Go buy the Christine book/movie. Your money will be better spent. This film's like trying to watch \\"Easy Rider\\" sober.
1594488843|2.0|The empirical evidence provided in the book about rewards was interesting. However, I don't agree with the psychological description he gives. It is a black and white type of argumentation (extrinsic vs. intrinsic)and the book had very limited value to me in the end.   I'm in particular dissapointed how he uses the concept of 'flow' from Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. He takes it and puts it in his created 'type', which is certainly NOT accurate! It's not because I like to be personally praised (extrinsic), that I wouldn't experience 'flow' (intrisic motivation), in fact, I have a lot of emboddied experiences once I'm working. So, to me this is empirically proven to be wrong or, at least, not accurate at all! But I'm afraid it's the best this author has to offer... or maybe you think his 'holiday tips' are worthwhile?...[...]

0938045768|4.0|Convict Conditioning is a book of bodyweight only training. It utilizes six training exercises, each having ten different variations. The six exercises are called \\"the Big Six\\", and they are one-arm pushup, one legged squat (pistol squat), one-arm pullup, hanging straight leg raise, stand-to-stand bridge, and one-arm handstand pushup. You don't start with these exercises, but rather easier versions, and they represent the ultimate goal of the workout.<br /><br />The workout is structured so that each exercise of the Big Six is divided into ten steps, the final step being the exercises listed earlier. As a general rule, the first steps are the easiest and you move gradually to more challenging variations. For example, you start the pushups series with standing pushups against the wall, and progress from there into incline pushups against a table, then kneeling pushpus, and so on until you reach the one-arm pushup.<br /><br />Each of the steps are further divided into three stages: Beginner standard, Intermediate standard, and Progression standard. The standards differ from each other by the number of repetitions and sets you are supposed to perform each exercise. When you reach the Progression standard of an exercise, you can move on to the next step, where you'll start from the Beginner standard.<br /><br />The author emphasizes clean performance of exercises, and slow progression through the steps. You are supposed to start from step one with each exercise even if you could jump directly to step six, for example. And you are supposed to progess slowly through each step, taking a minimum of one month on each step no matter how easy the exercise is for you.<br /><br />The name of the book is derived from the inception of the training system - or so the story goes. The author \\"Paul Wade\\" (not his real name) has supposedly spent a major portion of his adult life in prison, and there he has gained reputation of being able to coach himself and his fellow inmates into excellent shape. And because there are no free weigts allowed in prisons, the workouts had to consist of bodyweight exercises only. The credibility of the story has been questioned, but no doubt it gives a marketing edge; something where the book stands alone from countless other bodyweight only training manuals. In my opinion, it's a shame because the training system is very good if not excellent, and the shadow of doubt over the backround strory can put the whole book into questionable light.<br /><br />The system - as already stated - in very good. It offers very good progression of bodyweight exercises, with which creating a progression is much harder than with free weights. Also, in addition to the progression system, there is a cycling of intensity built into the system. As the Beginner standard of each step is easier than the Progression standard on the previous step, you'll get an automatic cycling down of intensity each time you progress to a higher step.<br /><br />The price tag is a bit high, as is the case with many Dragondroor publications. This time however, I feel the price is not exsessive but the book is worth the price. Another complaint is that I would have the author clarify some points in the self-coaching chapter as there is some things that are not explained fully. These things drop the star count from five to four. Otherwise an excellent book!ere are no free weigts allowed in prisons, the workouts had to consist of bodyweight exercises only.

0316044938|2.0|I was away on business and forgot a book.  So I went to the local BN and bought this book since I heard so much hype about it.  The book started well, but lost steam for me.  I finished the whole book but I do not think it lived up to the hype at all, much less enough for it to make it into a film.  The advertisements around this book offered hope, and there is none to offer at the end of this book.  I understand that evil doers do not always get caught, but I still felt very unsatisfied.  Some of the concepts in the book was a bit too out there for me too.  Overall, I was disappointed.

0399215921|2.0|I was surprised to find such tiny print in a book for little ones.  As a teacher, I really couldn't use it.
B0002KPIKA|5.0|I agree with all of the positive reviews, with one reservation.  Overall I think Thierry Gregoire has a wonderful voice, and mostly sang well, but honestly I have to say that there are a few places in quick, difficult passages where he loses it -- lags way behind the tempo and goes flat.  I imagine it is just one of the unfortunate hazards of live performance -- anyone can have a few bad moments.  It did detract from the performance for me.  That being said, however, everything else about this production (including the other 95% of Gregoire's singing!) works for me so well that I STILL give it 5 stars.  I especially love Gens, Perruche and Jaroussky, but I think everyone did a super job.    If you are into early opera this is a must have DVD.  And if you are just exploring to see if you might like early opera -- try this one.  If you don't like this you probably won't like much else from this genre and era.

B0036EH3XE|5.0|I just wanted to give this season the full amount of stars to make up for the bitter people who complain about not getting their questions answered.  Life isn't always tied up in a nice bow.  This wasn't a 30 min. sit-com.  I'm ok with not all the questions being answered.  The ending was beautiful and I thought it was very creative.  They couldn't make everyone happy and I'm glad they didn't try because this was much better than just getting a bunch of answers thrown at us.
B000000H4A|5.0|While not his best effort, it's definitely one of his more solid albums. Sure \\"Fatal Portrait\\" and his 3rd release \\"Them\\" or anything to the present, pale in comparison to \\"Abigail\\". This album is very important to the King Diamond canon, his first solo release after Mercyful Fate's break up (initial, anyways). \\"Fatal Portrait\\" for all intensive purposes, is basically another MF album in it's sound and writing...however the first 4 tracks (The Candle, The Jonah, The Portrait, Dressed in White) and the original album ender 'Haunted' are one concept story, which I will not divulge...but it's a sign of things to come. King didn't do a full concept album here, I guess the thinking was, if it didn't work out, they'd stick to the normal one-song routine (i.e. the rest of the album). The real value of \\"Fatal Portrait\\" is the simple fact that it's a transitional album...a great example of \\"what was, and what shall be\\". This album is certainly the heaviest of his solo output...music wise though, it's sounds more creative than Mercyful Fate...and the biggest shift is in the lyrics, it's no longer \\"Satan this, and Satan that\\" all the time, which is a breath of fresh air.<br /><br />Okay, my final thoughts...this is an album that's worthy of any collection. A very good starting point that gives the listener both worlds (MF and KD). Storyline is great! HOWEVER....if you're a new fan of King Diamond, but don't like Mercyful Fate yet, then I wouldn't suggest this as the starting point to KD recordings. For those people that are here reading this, my suggestion to you is \\"Abigal\\" or \\"Them\\"...then try this one a little later. Rock on!

B000PDYVVG|5.0|I pick up 90% of my books from the clearance rack at my local used bookstore.  The 10% are either books passed to me by fellow readers or are used books I bought following an interest brought on by a book I liked from the clearance rack.  And because I shop on the clearance rack I read a wide variety of topics and genres.  This book was a great clearance purchase.  I really liked this book from beginning to end.  It's full of hope and lots of twists and turns.  If you are looking for a good read that will take you through self discovery and some world travel definitely pick this book up.  Basically I rate a book to be really good if I pass the book on.  This book I passed on quickly and it's funny bc it was eventually passed back to me by a different friend.  This book led me to read Still Life with Chickens by Catherine Goldhammer, which I liked, and led me to add Trafficking in Sheep: A Memoir: From Off-Broadway, New York, to Blue Island, Nova Scotia by Anne Barclay Priest to my wish list.    Happy Reading!
B003ITZBW2|5.0|As a long time comic fan who has been disappointed with many animated movies based on books or comics I was wary about purchasing Batman: Under the Red Hood for that reason but chose to take a chance.<br /><br />Like many other reviews I can say that I'm pleased that I did. For such a short run time, it manage to include much of the material that was included in the 2 graphic novels of the same title. It was filled with action, some nicely timed humor that reflects better on screen that it did in a book. A couple scenes weren't there that I would have liked to have seen but overall this movie did stay true to form and didn't disappoint.<br /><br />The voice acting was also very well done though as another reviewer mentioned I would have liked to have had Conroy and Hamil do Batman and the Joker but Bruce Greenwood did an excellent job with Batman and Jensen Ackles couldn't have been more perfect as Jason Todd a.k.a. the Red Hood.<br /><br />Comic fans or fans of the animated Batman should enjoy this movie a lot.

0307388921|5.0|Chuck is a great organizer of ideas we all hear throughout life. From tidbits of trivia about the secretive way we talk of terrorists and death to the ways in which art may have started in ancient Greece.<br /><br />The entertaining style of writing keeps even the most mundane scenes interesting and it all ties up to a terribly thrilling ending to tie each idea up with one another. So many ideas written throughout the book express themselves in the actions of each character to form a sort of icon for each idea, emblemized as a disturbed person we'd normally never give a passing glance. With Chuck's books the average workers of each industry represent the true nature of all humans in Greek Myth sort of way.
B00383YC2S|4.0|I love Alizee since I heard her on the sound track of the movie, A Good Year', which I also loved.  This CD is a little 'expected'....but she's fabulous.  Her earlier recordings are better
0312370849|3.0|The beginning of the story is pretty interesting, but I felt that the author rushed the ending a bit.  It's worth reading it once.
B003K1EYM6|3.0|I have heard mostly very good things about the camera connection kit.  However, neither Apple or Best Buy seem to have any in stock.  I looked here on Amazon and was shocked that there was 1 listing for this kit that comes through amazon prime, except that the cost is $54.00.  Forgive my use of this but WTF?  Some mail order company bought them in bulk to sell at an almost 100% markup.  I would really just like to know why neither Apple nor amazon have done anything about this?  If it works as expected when I can finally get it, I'll certainly give it 5 stars.  For now, I'll give it 3 as a sign of good faith.
B00000IWVS|5.0|I love this album for all the reasons most people don't.  It is nice to hear a performance of Chopin that doesn't  engage in all the pretensions and cliché's that typically come with other Chopin recordings.  Frankly I am tired of hearing pristine recordings that are supposed to, as one reviewer put it, show \\"profound insight into the human condition,\\" depict a \\"broad world-view,\\" or other such nonsense.  Argerich has a very abrasive sound compounded all the more by the thickness of the piano and brash reverberation of the recording location.  It is as if she is playing the music of Chopin with the attitude of Beethoven.         Musicologists will, I have no doubt, hate this album (which is possibly one more reason to love it).   If you are looking for something to relax, sit down, and sip a glass of wine to, then this is probably NOT a recording you are going to want to purchase.
0802798225|5.0|Make sure you have some free time when you start this book because it will grab you from the first page and you won't want to put it down until the last.<br /><br />I have read many books (I mostly read romance), and I have to say that regardless of the fact that this is a YA book, it's simply one of the best and most memorable books I've ever read.<br /><br />This is a classic Romeo and Juliet/ West Side story (with a nice ending).  This is a book that alternates chapters in first person narrative between Alex and Brittany.  I love this techniques because you as a reader are sucked into both Alex's world and viewpoints and you are also able to \\"see\\" into Brittany's.  Neither of these individual's are who they portray themselves to be, and I loved how they begin to discover that out for themselves.<br /><br />This is a love story, but it is also the story of family and what we will do for the people we love.  I was captivated and engrossed by both these individual's lives.  The violence surrounding Alex's and the guilt and superficialness surrounding Brittany's.<br /><br />The epilogue is one of my favorite parts and I closed this book with a silly grin on my face.  It has stayed with me and I can't wait to read it all over again!  Just excellent.
B002OEBMN4|3.0|I Gave Christ Illusion a chance because it was the return of Dave Lombardo. I hated that CD. It sounded worse than the collection of post Lombardo albums to me. Mediocre thrash riffs with Araya yelling as loud as he can over them.. ugg. I listened to the sample tracks here on Amazon for World Painted Blood and for some reason thought that this albuum would be different. It's not. the first track actually got me excited and pumped up. Then... the other 10 tracks played and I had to shake my head in frustration. I guess this is what Slayer has become since Seasons in the Abyss. A mediocre thrash band that puts the same album out year after year. Lame...

B002C6K7N0|5.0|It's been a while since I spent money on this band, and after reading some of the reviews I was hesitant to purchase. I listened to the sample tracks and thought it sounded ok. Well, im about four listens into this CD and I love it. It has grown on me nicley. It has hints of all Megadeth albums past (I even hear a little killing is my business in there...), with some shredding guitar leads. Very similar to their older tracks like Wake up Dead, 502, Etc..If you were a fan of Megadeth in the 80's, this CD should do it for you.

1597801585|5.0|With everything that has been said regarding Paolo Bacigalupi's The Windup Girl, I was certainly expecting a quality read. Yet it's much more than that. Simply put, The Windup Girl could well be the finest science fiction novel of the year.    Here's the blurb:    Anderson Lake is a company man, AgriGen's Calorie Man in Thailand. Under cover as a factory manager, Anderson combs Bangkok's street markets in search of foodstuffs thought to be extinct, hoping to reap the bounty of history's lost calories. There, he encounters Emiko...   Emiko is the Windup Girl, a strange and beautiful creature. One of the New People, Emiko is not human; instead, she is an engineered being, creche-grown and programmed to satisfy the decadent whims of a Kyoto businessman, but now abandoned to the streets of Bangkok. Regarded as soulless beings by some, devils by others, New People are slaves, soldiers, and toys of the rich in a chilling near future in which calorie companies rule the world, the oil age has passed, and the side effects of bio-engineered plagues run rampant across the globe.     What happens when calories become currency? What happens when bio-terrorism becomes a tool for corporate profits, when said bio-terrorism's genetic drift forces mankind to the cusp of post-human evolution? In The Windup Girl, award-winning author Paolo Bacigalupi returns to the world of \\"The Calorie Man\\" ( Theodore Sturgeon Memorial Award-winner, Hugo Award nominee, 2006) and \\"Yellow Card Man\\" (Hugo Award nominee, 2007) in order to address these poignant questions.    The worldbuilding was impeccable. I was fascinated with the way Bacigalupi portrayed a dystopian Bangkok and the rest of Southeast Asia. How the entire world is in a desperate struggle for survival against rising sea levels and climate changes, as well as the devastation caused by deadly crop mutations forcing millions of people to starve and die of hunger or disease. The author paints a very grim picture concerning the inevitable bleak future that our corporate and mass-consumption world will lead us to. The post-oil worl was another engrossing aspect of The Windup Girl, with power being provided by human labor and genetically engineered animals. Thailand, the main environment in which the story occurs, has remained more or less independent by maintaining an unflagging isolationist policy, which has so far enabled the country to stay ahead of the global agricultural corporations that control the worldwide economy.    The characterization is top notch with three-dimensional characters throughout. The Windup Girl is comprised of several POV characters, thus allowing the reader to see events unfold through the eyes of a number of disparate characters with conflicting agendas. Though Emiko, the titular character, often takes center stage, various others such as Hock Seng, Anderson Lake, Jaidee, and Kanya play major roles throughout the book. Witnessing the conflict between the Environmental Ministry and the Trade Ministry through the eyes of protagonists on both sides of the problem was quite interesting.    Although the pace of the novel is never brisk, Paolo Bacigalupi's sucks you right into this disconcerting dystopian tale from the very beginning. Enthralling, The Windup Girl doesn't let up till you reach the end, which should make you beg for more.    If you are looking for an intelligent and thought-provoking read, enter this post-globalisation world in which calorie companies control the economy with their manufactured sterile crops. But Thailand possesses a priceless resource that Western interests will stop at nothing to find: a secret genebank composed of countless strains of crops that could be used to combat the numerous plagues and perhaps help put an end to world hunger. And at the heart of this story lie an American calorie man, a Japanese genetically engineered young woman, and an old Yellow Card Man who lost everything when Muslim fundamentalists overran his country.    Paolo Bacigalupi's The Windup Girl is an absorbing read. It does for Southeast Asia what Ian McDonald's River of God did to a not-so-distant in the future India.    One of the top SFF reads of 2009!
B00260HH3K|1.0|The Dragonball Evolution story comes from an Asian comic book series.  I have never read this comic book, but was recommended to watch this movie by fans of the serial.  And so I did, and I was horribly disappointed.  The entire story is quite original to those who have no background in Asian comic book stories, and I won't go into the details here, but everything else was horrible.  First of, why is the main character a white man when the setting is in Asia, and the main character's father is Oriental?  Second, why do all these Hollywood produced movies have to have the white man pick up the hot chinese babe in the movie?  Why not the other way around?  And why did Chow-Yun Fat sign up for this movie?  His role was utterly ridiculous.  Worst of all was the kung fu fighting.  It had all the apparent use of special effects, high-wire stunts, and second-by-second choreography, without any of the spirit, drama or tension seen in the Hong Kong-made martial arts movies.  Luckily again, the plot is quite original with several unexpected twists to keep the viewer interested.
1881273377|5.0|This is the most helpful book on relationships EVER written!  If you are in a loving relationship, engaged, newly weds or married for many years, YOU NEED TO READ THIS.  In fact, I recommend reading it once a year to keep it fresh in your mind.  I've never heard anything that makes more sense than this book.  I like books read to me while I drive, so I bought this as an audiobook.  I'm listening to it for the second time.  My husband is listening to it.  I plan to pass it on to my friends when we are done.  If everyone would learn the Five Love Languages and learn how to use them with their spouses, children and closest friends, the world would be a happier place.  This was recommended to me by a marriage counselor.  This will probably save my marriage and make us a happier couple if we follow the instructions.
1935251740|5.0|Author Robert Lanza MD has, since childhood, sought out and been mentored by Nobel Laureates and it shows.   His radical presentation of the last 50-70 years of quantum physics research and the significance of that research takes us beyond where The Tao of Physics and others started.   His clear readable text (combined with some amazing personal stories of his colorful and dysfunctional upbringing) brings us face to face with the fact that science, like conventional religion, has an \\"edge\\" beyond which nothing is understood - like \\"why are we here?\\" or \\"what happened before the Big Bang?\\"   A beautiful, hopeful, and brilliant case for consciousness underlying all of Creation, told from the scientific point of view.   Great read!
0307271862|5.0|Mankell literally surpassed himself with this remarkably presented tale of a gruesome murder that affects the lives of many people in many lands. After reading his first Kurt Wallander mystery, Faceless Killers, and the five short stories called The Pyramid, I thought of Henning Mankell as a good writer, but not a terrific one. This novel, which is not about his detective Wallander, the subject of ten of his mysteries, does not have the slow almost plodding pace I felt in the two other books of his that I read. The drama moves at a proper pace, with interesting characters, revealing intriguing information from time to time that does not fully disclose what prompted the murders or their impact upon society, but which draws the reader's attention, causes her to think, and heightens her interest. I was surprised that I did not find this splendid novel among the top fifteen best sellers on the New York Times list.<br /><br /> A photographer discovers a horrid group of murders in a small Swedish village where every inhabitant, everyone old, is brutally killed with repeated vicious knife wounds, as if the killer wanted the people to suffer as they lay dying. But three villagers are not killed or even attacked and a young boy is killed by a single thrust, without violence. Why old people? Why were two not quite old people and a senile woman spared? Why was the boy not mistreated? Is this a unique crime, or did it occur before?<br /><br /> The police, led by a zaftig, aggressive, middle age, sharp-speaking detective and a lead prosecutor with book knowledge, but no experience, discover a somewhat disturbed repeat criminal who admits to the crime, and then commits suicide. A district court judge from another part of Sweden realizes that two of the victims had been foster parents to her mother. She travels to the village and finds objects and witnesses that the police refuse to examine: a ribbon from a local Chinese restaurant, the picture of the Chinese man who sat at the table when the ribbon was removed, a hotel owner who saw the man, a diary of a vicious Swedish man who mistreated Chinese, blacks, and Indians during the mid-1800s while these enslaved people were forced to build the American railroad.<br /><br /> Besides the brutal murder of Swedes, interesting characters, and the story of the American railroads, the crime affects non-Swedish families, the future of China and Africa, and the judge finds herself pursued by unknown people both in Sweden and in England.ble when the ribbon was removed, a hotel owner who saw the man, a diary of a vicious Swedish man who mistreated Chinese, blacks, and Indians during the mid-1800s while these enslaved people were forced to build the American railroad.<br /><br /> Besides the brutal murder of Swedes, interesting characters, and the story of the American railroads, the crime affects non-Swedish families, the future of China and Africa, and the judge finds herself pursued by unknown people both in Sweden and in England.
B003KT3NRA|5.0|When I first heard that Vince Neil would be doing a solo project like this, I was skeptical, depsite loving Nikki and Tommy's solo projects. However I'm totally willing to admit that my skeptisism wasn't necissary. Where most artists that go solo rely on previous popularity and old fan-bases, Vince Neil relyed on nothing but his raw vocal talent. Perhaps the fact that it's Vince Neil of Motley Crue was the swaying factor that made me buy the album, but I know that even if it wasn't Vince Neil, this album would be an undoubted success! More than impressed, definately a five-star performance from one of the best vocalists around!
0307577589|5.0|After finishing the Stieg Larsson remarkable trilogy, I heard from two people, on separate occasions, that they watched the VCR of Larsson's first book and thought it was one of the best movies that they ever saw. Like most people who have read a good book, especially one with well-drawn-out characters, delightful descriptions, and many unusual events, like this book, I would have preferred not to see the movie version because, the nature of movies, especially the time constraints and the filmmaker imposing his imagination upon viewers who have preconceived notions of the characters, how they look, move, speak, and even smile, makes it impossible to give movie viewers what they were able to gain from the book itself. But I rented the VCR and saw the movie.<br /><br /> Although the movie is two and a half hours long and although as my friends promised it was an excellent Swedish production with good subtitles, two and a half hours was much too short by probably several hours to capture what made the Larsson book a world-wide reading phenomenon. Virtually all the subplots were absent. Blomkvitz's unusual sexual experience was gone, so too his struggles to publish the Millennium issue that uncovered the crimes of the man who caused his imprisonment. Most significant was the paring down of the personality of Lisbeth Salander who was the most significant character in the novel. We had hints of her unusual abilities and quirks and sometimes violent nature, but missed the full descriptions that made the book so interesting. We were presented with what could be called an excellent outline of the main plot without its details. Or, to use another metaphor, we were given the skeleton of a woman without the flesh that made her a beauty.<br /><br /> However, if a viewer thinks of the movie as a different entity, if it stands alone without comparison to the book, it was, as I was told, very good.
0765322889|5.0|Rich and wonderfully complex, the first installment in the Malazan series was rife with mystery, history, and unanswered questions. There is an amazing amount of depth to this story, and I'm talking hundreds of thousands of years of history. Like in The Lord of the Rings, there is an entire mythology wrapped up in the back story that has radical implications on the plot of this first book.<br /><br />I'm glad Erikson has finished working on the 10th and final book. It looks like I may be able to read them all straight through to the end.
030726999X|2.0|I couldn't wait for this book to be put out in the US.  I just had to find out what happened to Salander.  Well, I was let down in spades.  This book is just so boring!  Who cares about Blomkvist and his penchant for bedding every woman in Sweden?  What, in heaven's name is the attraction?  And the fact that every single one of them falls so hard for him sounds like the fanciful dreaming of Larsson as a junior high school boy.  Give me a break!  Then there's all that stuff about the secret service:  who cares?  Doesn't add to the story one iota.  Took me 3 weeks to get through the thing, and I did it that 'quickly' because I was determined to finish the trilogy.  Ugg!  Terrible.  I gave it 2 stars instead of 3 because now I know the ending that Larsson had in mind.  That's the only reason.
0061478784|4.0|I enjoyed the movie adaptation of this story when I saw it a year ago or so and as is usually the case, the book is better. In fact, they're almost two entirely different stories. The movie maintains the basic characterization and some of the plot points, but it changes other things fairly dramatically. I really enjoyed this story even though I kept hearing the actors' voices from the movie, which I don't think are necessarily fitting for the characters as they exist in the book.<br /><br />I found the characters well drawn and believable even though they remained basically static through most of the story. I also loved the idea of the moving castle and what that would enable those who lived in it to do.<br /><br />This was the first of Jones' novels that I've read and I am definitely open to reading others.
B0030Y11XS|1.0|Say this about Michael Moore: He's consistent.    In his latest offering \\"Capitalism: A Love Story\\", Mr. Moore takes us on a journey into pure emotionalism and sensationalism only to arrive at the obvious conclusion: European socialism rules.    Some key points:    He spends quite a bit of time on the major banks (or big monster mega banks as Clark Howard refers to them as) and their complicity in the financial meltdown, including the mortgage crises.  He shows us images of people being kicked out of their homes that the bank has foreclosed on.  Very emotional, yet we are given very little detail as to what circumstances led to these individuals losing their home. The banks were wrong for issuing home loans to unqualified borrowers, however equal blame must be assessed to the people that signed the contract for a loan on a house they obviously couldn't afford and a federal government that guaranteed these loans in the guise of \\"Everyone has the right to own a home\\".    Newsflash: You do not have the right to own a home if you can't afford it.    He rightfully demonstrates examples of low life individuals who take advantage of the system.  One such example shows 2 judges that were taking money from a private company that actually runs the local junvenille hall.  The \\"incarceration rate\\" went up as a result of this, even for relatively minor offenses.  Yes this is disgusting, however how is the representative of all capitalism?    And so it is with this \\"documentary\\".  Moore shows us one off examples of obvious greed and complete disregard for humanity and then expects us to conclude that these examples are the norm for all capitalists.  His solution?  We should switch to the European socialist model.  Yes that will solve everything.  Because Europe is doing so well with this system, well except for Greece and Spain, but don't worry yourself with those countries, it's just a temporary glitch until the TRUE socialism can take root.    Finally his display of Obama winning the election as some sort of populist victory is laughable at best.  Obama has surrounded himself with some of the same Wall Street people that helped get us into this mess.  Obama is a crony capitalist, not an idealogical socialist as so many have painted him as on the right.    The bottom line with this film is that if you are looking for a serious examination of the financial meltdown and it's causes and possible solutions, you won't find it here.  If you are interesting in an emotional one sided \\"power to the people\\" 2 hour extravaganza, this movie will fit that bill perfectly.

As I got to the end, I turned to the recap and discovered that indeed pretty much everything I had read in the book had stuck with me. Each of the brief keywords in the recap made me recall exactly the point the authors had been trying to make. This is of course something that should be expected of two guys writing a book about how to make people remember things. But it was great to have it confirmed nonetheless.    The book was a very pleasant read and I'm looking forward to putting it into practice!
B000UNYJXQ|1.0|So here we are once again. Our good buddy Michael Moore is going to do what he does best: Oversimplify a complex issue.<br /><br />For instance, in Sicko we learn that the Cuban system of medicine is far superior to the United States.  How do we learn this?  He brings some everyday Americans with him to Cuba to buy their expensive exploitive American medicines for little to no money.  Wow.  That Fidel Castro is such a compassionate and progressive fellow isn't he? No mention is made of course of the lousy economic and political conditions in the country. Hint: There is a reason why people risk their life boarding a piece of junk raft and make their way to Miami.  If it was so wonderful to live in Cuba, people wouldn't do that.  Have you ever heard of somebody boarding a wooden raft or boat to leave the United States for some other country?  No, didn't think so, although I wouldn't put it past Sean Penn to do something like that.<br /><br />He also takes us to Canada where he interviews our Canuck friends in a health clinic.  He asks them how much money they had to shell out for their visit.  Why none of course!  It's free you silly goose you.  What he doesn't tell you is that Canadians actually do pay for their own healthcare, they just do it in the form of higher taxes and now they also have money withheld from their checks specifically for their health insurance premiums.  The system is under financial strain as you can imagine.  It turns out the Canadian health care system has the same price pressures as the US system.  The only difference is how the bills are paid.  While it isn't true that you have to wait months for an emergency procedure as some alarmists have suggested, it is true that if you do not live in a major metropolitan area of Canada, finding adequate health care is difficult.  But that is a function of the remoteness of certain locations rather than any fault with the system.  Keep in mind also, Canada is a country of about 34 million people. Much smaller than the US, so a system for 34 million may not be the best solution for 300+ million.<br /><br />We are treated to the usual emotional tactics that are the hallmark of all Michael Moore movies.  Show people telling tear jerking stories about hardships in life, then conclude that because of that, the system needs to be changed.  As usual, we do not hear all of the specifics behind these cases.  We are just supposed to believe that the people are all good and the corporations are all evil and sacrifice babies in a fiery pit (ok that was an exaggeration, but the general message is clear).<br /><br />Healthcare is a very complex issue.  The problems cannot be evaluated or solved with appeals to emotionalism.  A very serious and dedicated study must be made to find out what the issues are and how do we address them.  Passing legislation to overhaul our healthcare system without doing due diligence will lead to financial disaster.  The socialist medicine examples shown in this film are the product of governments trying to give the people what they want as quickly as they can for political gain, rather than trying to find the best solution to the problem which in many cases is not a quick fix.  But in today's instant gratification world, it fits the bill.<br /><br />So in conclusion, I wouldn't waste my money on this.  I would rent this, but not buy.

0061122416|3.0|This book has been hailed as a literary marvel, selling millions and translated into hundreds of languages. The question I asked myself after finishing the book was, why?<br /><br />While ultimately enjoyable, I did not find it to be spiritually uplifting or applicable to life in general. I have no problem with the message \\"Follow your dreams,\\" which is basically what this book takes 200 pages to say; I merely have a problem with the second part of the message, which is \\"At any cost.\\"<br /><br />It is easy to have your lead character be a poor shepherd boy with no possessions other than a few dozen sheep and a book and say, \\"Follow your dream at any cost.\\" It would be much more difficult to have the main character be a shepherd with a home and a family and tell that character to do the same. That element bugged me from the get-go, which made Coelho's attempts at selling anything else along the way null and void.<br /><br />Santiago's journey is enjoyable and vividly described, but it is not the search for happiness of the spirit and the soul; in the end turns out to be a search for physical gold treasure. In the end, it is a quest of great selfishness, one in which the human companions Santiago meets along the way are quickly discarded when they are of no more use.<br /><br />An enjoyable book and an easy read yet one laden with major flaws that hollow out the core of the message.

B001GCUO5W|5.0|Those who were frustrated by the turn this movie takes seem to have missed the point.  This work shares something with Mulholland Drive and A Beautiful Mind in that it shows us the alternate version of reality before we (seemingly) see the consensual one.  I find this to be the only really revelatory way to explore the realm of insanity.  The fact that we are not even sure at the end about what the external reality actually is makes the film even more thought-provoking.  Those looking for something more straighforward and conventional already have plenty of that sort of movies to choose from.  Thank you, Mr. Scorsese, for this wonderfully meditative masterpiece.  Is it occasionally a tiny bit self-indulgent?  Perhaps, but you've earned it!
B000SMWUPS|4.0|I love my European stroller, but it doesn't have cup holders.  And when we go to the zoo, a giant soda is absolutely necessary to keep fueled for lots of hilly stroller pushing. I had high hopes when I ordered the Sunshine Kids Stroller Accessory Buggy Buddy, and it gets the job done, at least for my needs.  It has enough room to hold my cell phone, small wallet, and giant soda.  It's not overly sturdy so I wouldn't advise two large adult drinks.  It can handle a sippy cup/bottle and a adult drink (but your wallet will need to be moved), and that's fine by me.  On the off chance my husband comes with us to the zoo, he can carry his own cup.

I seem to be in the minority here, but I liked Linger more than I did Shiver.<br /><br />I still don't understand Sam though. I've decided not call him gay anymore, because he makes it abundantly clear that he loves Grace. So instead, I will just call him feminine. I mean this boy<br />1. bakes bread<br />2. reads German poetry<br />3. writes sappy love songs<br />4. cooks<br />5. folds paper<br />6. is sensitive (aka moody). And not in the sexy-never-know-what-hes gonna-do way, but in the oh-no-hes-crying-again way.<br />Seriously, this boy would get eaten alive in any high school. I still like Grace though. She's neat. Smart and savvy.<br /><br />But I am glad its not just those two anymore. If I had to read another 350 paged sappy lovefest between those two, I wouldn't be able to take it. So I'm glad for the new POV of Isabel and Cole. I've always liked Isabel. She's ballsy but not invulnerable. I like how she isn't portayed as perfect. And then there's Cole....I won't even try to hide the crush I have on him. *shrugs* I have a thing for damaged rock stars. It was interesting to see the whole situation through their eyes. It kept the story fresh, and I didn't get confused when ever there was a shift in perspective. And I don't care much about Isabel and Cole as a couple. That's not really necessary.<br /><br />And of course I was pissed at the parents. Not because they did what did in itself, but because they did it without precedence. Its kinda like when my mother let my dog run around the yard just after installing the electric fence. My dog was running around, not a care in the world, unaware that a few feet away was an underground wire that would shock her if she came near it. My dog was not aware that the boundry existed, which is why it was made all the more cruel when she got zapped.<br /><br />The writing, as usual, was good. There is something so delicate about it that sets the mood for the story.

I think we've had it at least 6 months with no air leaks.  I've never put water in it so I can't comment there.  I do see how it would make a great birthing pool. It's quite comfortable to sit in and the sides are high enough to support your back.

0312370849|1.0|The story took a nosedive halfway through the novel. I liked the chapters that were written from Sarah's point of view. Once the narrative switched to present day Julia Jarmond, it felt more like a melodramatic romance than the historical novel it should have been. I also did not care for the ending.  I thought it was very contrived. I would rather have seen a different ending for Sarah and her brother. I feel like the author shortchanged her and the novel sufferred as a result. This is the reason the novel overall only has 4 star rating. Individuals like me did not enjoy reading the second half.

B002VH7P4O|5.0|I love the Beatles music! I have Japanese and British pressings of most of their records and mono releases of a few. I think I have 5 different pressings of Revolver alone. I am now considering selling them because of the wonderful sound and ease of use of this collection.     My computer holds most of my music, and putting the 24 bit files in with the rest of my music was easy, as was adding the mp3s to iTunes. Curiously, some of the mp3s were not as good as previously ripped compressed files from my vinyl, but these were few. The clarity and musical flow of the big flac files rival any of the pressings I paid so much for and often surpasses them.     This is the way to hear The Beatles in Stereo. You need the Mono Box Set too, really, you do. But this will take care of your stereo Beatles collection. In one fell swoop!

B001GCUO5W|5.0|I recommend Shutter Island to anyone who likes twists in the plot or unexpected endings. The movie has a modest amount of action and exceptional acting done by Leonardo DiCaprio, Mark Ruffalo along with other members of the cast. The setting seems to fit Leo's familiarity of acting as in being that of the 20-60's era. The only way someone could not like this movie is if they watched it with a closed mind or if they just like being miserable.

1932100660|1.0|This book got my back up almost from the start.  Whilst there is some worthwhile nutritional information for the uninitiated, I find the author's writings dictatorial and I very quickly found myself questioning his experiments and studies.  I lived for 16 years amongst Chinese in Hong Kong in the 50s and 60s and granted the rural Chinese may be less omnivoric but Chinese people do eat meat, including dog and cat.  I have a problem with the 'across the board' condemnation of meat consumption.  Everyone is different.  A number of years ago I decided to become a vegetarian, and became very sick after 15 months.  I went back to my old meat/fish/eggs diet (admittedly without much dairy) and followed the Blood Type diet as far as it suited me.  I have regained my health, and nothing, certainly not this book, will persuade me to eschew meat and fish again.  I am careful with the amounts of protein I eat, but it is quite possible that some of us need vitamins, minerals or other substances in meat and fish that have not yet been identified.  Yes, some of us do very well on a vegetarian, vegan or raw food diet, but not all.

1400097029|4.0|The Sea, in my opinion, did deserve the award bestowed upon it. The Man Booker Prize.  John Banville's accounts of one summer during his childhood and his present day situation are woven together with a stream of consciousness so natural it would seem the author wrote a mini memoir or recollection. Some reviewers have found the story to be a bit lacking in development or action, but I believe that was the point of the book. One man's look back on two key points in his life that have given him some pain and he tries to find some understanding or reasoning behind them. Has not anyone ever done that? I am sure they have, but John Banville does it with style and exquisite prose that certainly captures the nuances of memory and one's existence presently. The Sea was a great read if you appreciate language, and I am looking forward to reading his novel The Infinities. I would recommend this writer to anyone who has read Wallace Stegner's Angle of Repose, The Road by Cormac McCarthy, or Jim Harrison's Returning to Earth.
B003O85W3A|4.0|I often find myself startled by the number of indie rock fans I encounter who rank Arcade Fire's Neon Bible above Funeral.  Why?  I always regarded the album as being emotionally overwrought (bordering on contrived) and heavy handed.  That's not to say I don't love a lot of the songs for their musical composition, but I do regard many of the record's lyrics as being overly dramatic and self-righteous with the way they frequently describe modern life as threatened by external influences (e.g. Religious Faith and Big Business).  Said more plainly, while Funeral did a remarkable job of documenting the individual's experience of emotional suffering, Neon Bible's attempts at naming the sources responsible for this anguish came off as simultaneously bombastic, and a bit hollow.<br /><br />That being said, I didn't have the highest critical expectations for The Suburbs.  Despite many of these critiques, however, The Suburbs is an album that does an excellent job of avoiding many of problems I had with Neon Bible.  Accordingly, it reflects some smart artistic moves made by the group, and most importantly, demonstrates the Arcade Fire as a band actually capable of change.<br /><br />At sixteen tracks, there's certainly a lot of music on the album, and most of it's really good.  Likewise, it's pretty much what you've come to expect of Arcade Fire: Highly expressive rock songs featuring the affected vocals of Win Butler (and occasionally R&eacute;gine Chassagne) that receive garnish via unique orchestral flourishes and interesting instrument choices.<br /><br />However, in contrast to the bustling, turbo-charged arrangements of their first two records, at least half of The Suburbs' tracks' are considerably more relaxed, beginning with the easy shuffle of the title track and \\"Deep Blue\\", to the patient folk-jam of \\"City With No Children\\", and the militant, slow building \\"Wasted Hours\\".  Likewise, the languid nature of much of the album's material is thematically appropriate, given that the suburbs are generally seen as offering relief from the risks and stresses accompanying city life: Life in the suburbs is usually less fast paced, in addition to offering comforting distance (both geographic and psychological) from looming metropolises.  Though you can't really expect Arcade Fire to make music that praises a subject uniformly, the suburbs represent a great thematic vantage point for Win Butler's descriptions of emotional unease.<br /><br />There's also a noticeably self-referential quality to the album's lyrics, with Butler occasionally making (less than complimentary) lyrical nods to his band's eminent position on the indie music scene.  The sluggish \\"Rococo\\" is stinging indictment of current trends in music fandom.  In addition to describing treacherous windstorms impact on a Canadian community, \\"Month of May\\", Butler unexpectedly includes the observation that \\"the kids are still standin' with their arms folded tight\\", which is a juxtaposition inviting the conclusion that Butler views hipsters and Mother Nature as similar with regards to their merciless disregard for the efforts of others.<br /><br />Located near the album's close, \\"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains)\\" represents a clearly identifiable centerpiece.  Bearing substantial resemblance to Funeral's \\"Haiti\\", the track features a lead vocal from R&eacute;gine Chassagne, a four-on-the-floor drum beat, and a heavy use of electric organs and keyboards that evoke Caribbean environs.  The entire affair is somewhat reminiscent of Talking Head's New Wave-gospel stomp, \\"Road to Nowhere\\", though \\"Sprawl II\\" (to its credit) is both more lyrically reverential and sonically expansive.  The track is a triumph in the sense that despite its' pessimistic lyrics that depict the suburbs' as a source of social influence stressing undesirable uniformity, the song's music speaks to the satisfaction of resisting to conform, and the noticeable incongruence between the song's music and lyrics convey this oft-repeated lesson in a manner that proves neither clich&eacute;d nor trite.<br /><br />In sum, The Suburbs is a very good album that will probably continue to be fairly well regarded within Arcade Fire's catalogue.  Again, at sixteen tracks, the record is a bit lengthy.  Though it's hard to say that much of the album's material is \\"bad\\" by any stretch of the imagination, it may lack some of the immediate payoff offered by the band's earlier efforts.  The Suburbs may still feature a bit of the didactic sentiment found on Neon Bible, these elements are considerably less predominant, ultimately providing a listening experience more in line with what we want from Arcade Fire.neither clichéd nor trite.

B003C1QIO6|4.0|The cd like most of Jack's music is original. This cd has yet a different sound to it than those before. Could be described as upbeat. I still prefer the old acoustic Jack, but that's purely my preference. It's worth the 12 bucks or whatever you pay for it though definitely.
B0021L8V1Q|3.0|For this review, I'm not going to get into all the technical aspects of the movie or the other things that made this movie memorable. All I'm going to talk about it the lack of action in this movie (and series in general). I felt like this was an episode of the West Wing where the President (in this case Tony Stark) is getting pulled, manipulated and exploited and in the end it comes down to he and his real friends to get him out of the dilemma. I understand that the budget for Iron Man 2 was greatly increased from the first movie, but where was that money spent? Other than the Stark Convention floor, I didn't see anything in this installment that was any grander than the first. I feel like there's nothing but juxtaposition and exposition. No huge action scenes at all. For every hour of action, there is literally one minute of action. The action finale is a jumbled mess of angles and shots that leave a lot to be desired. I can only equate the finale between Stark and Whiplash to that of a charcoal grill that gets left unattended before the meat goes on. Sure, you can put more gas on the fire to get it hot again, but its going to be a few moments of flash and then back to being orange coals. I love the dialogue in the Iron Man movies, and I believe that it is the dialogue that sets these movies apart from the rest of the comic book films that have come out to date, but the third movie HAS to up the ante or it will become a one trick pony.    Also, I had a huge issue of the writers forgoing using the \\"Demon in a bottle\\" storyline for this movie, instead they use the arc reactor in his chest to \\"poison\\" him. Iron Man had a few stand out story lines since its creation and none were more human that demon in a bottle. They really dropped the ball on that part too.    All in all, I'll still buy the blu ray on release date. I'll still praise this movie and recommend it to friends. But in ten years, when we've only got 3(4 if we're lucky) Iron Man movies to go back and view,it'll be a lot of missed opportunities in this franchise.
B000063DI9|5.0|The 2002 remaster is compressed and loud, and while it's not quite as bad as Somewhere in Time or The Number of the Beast, it's still inferior to the original 1990 version.  As for the album itself, it's one of Maiden's most impressive efforts.  As in Somewhere in Time, the synthesizers add texture to the songs as opposed to completely dominating them, and the lyricism is far above average for the band.      While some consider this to be a concept album, only around half of the album's songs actually revolve around the 'concept' (which refers to the folk myth about a seventh son of a seventh son having special powers).  Of course, the album is good even if you don't pay attention to the \\"plot;\\" Moonchild, Infinite Dreams, and The Evil That Men Do are three of Maiden's all-time best songs, and Can I Play With Madness, The Clairvoyant and Only the Good Die Young are also quite good.      Surprisingly, the monstrous title track is a step down from those, although it does contain a fantastic instrumental section.  It's brought down by its overly repetitive chorus, though it's not a bad track overall.  As in every great Maiden album, there's one really rotten song that prevents it from being brilliant, and in this one it's The Prophecy.  Otherwise, Seventh Son is a great record, and a fitting end to the band's 80s output.
B001DF68MA|5.0|I love the WeeRide!  Biking with my 1 year old daughter has been a great bonding experience.  I am able to easily talk to her as we are looking at the same things.  I love having her in front of me, instead of behind where we wouldn't be able to communicate well.  The first time we went biking I was the one saying, \\"Weeeeee\\" the whole time!  I'm so happy with this purchase.        Attaching the mounting bar that the child seat sits on was a little difficult.  I have a mens bike that didn't have a lot of room from the bottom of the handle bar to the top of the bar to easily fit the mounting bar of the WeeRide in between that space.  I also had to permanently raise my seat up so the WeeRide mounting bar could attach underneath it, which now makes it hard for me to reach the floor comfortably.  If I was taller (5'3\\") then it wouldn't be a problem.        Other people have mentioned having to ride with your knees pointing out and that was true for me too.  Although it wasn't a problem and barely noticable since I am on the short side.  These two slight problems are both due to the type of bike I have, not the product in particular.  The riding experience is well worth the slight troubles.  I highly recommend the WeeRide!!
B003IPC5SO|5.0|I wasn't a big Kylie fan. I liked a few of her singles but never bought an album. I bought this one and love it! I listen to almost all of the tracks over and over again. Very fun, light, pop, upbeat songs. You can't go wrong with this one.
1416589473|5.0|Forbeck and Grubb have honestly delivered what fans of the Guild Wars series have been craving ever since the announcement of Guild Wars 2. Unfortunately, Guild Wars 2 is not out yet as of this post, but treat this product like a small bone thrown to the rabid fans of Guild Wars. The first chapter can be read for free on the official Guild Wars 2 website, which leaves readers like myself wanting more.     Now for the good parts: Fans who actually own the original Guild Wars and the expansions will be thrilled to know that characters from the past are mentioned in this book. The world should not be unfamiliar to those who have played the original Guild Wars Prophecies and the map that is included in the book will help the reader visualize where the party is at during the events in the book. The description of the environment which the characters are currently at are described very well, and I can actually imagine what it's like visiting Divinity's Reach!    Now for the critical part: The writing seems to drop off at some points but it immediately picks back up especially parts where there is a lot of action. There are few places where the locations are somewhat wrong, but this is just a fan nitpicking at parts of the book. Character development can be improved a fair bit as some characters just feel really empty without any improvement to them.    Overall, remember that this is only a story of a small group of adventurers who are on a mission. The book gives us a glimpse of what it's like seeing into the eyes of this odd party. The book was written generally for fans, but anyone can pick it up and give it a good read at a great price.    What is your story?
0545123283|3.0|Synopsis<br />Grace and Sam are back. Sam is still trying to convince himself that he is really cured, dealing with taking care of the Pack, and worrying about Grace. Grace has a headache. Isabel is drowning in the drama that is her home life when a naked guy shows up outside of her house. His name is Cole and he's one of the new recruits to the pack. She hates his cocky persona, but at the same time is drawn to him and his desire to lose himself as a wolf.<br /><br />Review<br />I think that it would have been really interesting to write this book from the perspective as Isabel. Her story line with Cole was the most interesting part of the book, and the Grace story line could have easily been placed as a secondary story line. By the end of the book, I was actually hoping for Grace to die. She was incredibly whiny the entire book, giving into her illness instead of taking any kind of initiative to help herself. I think that my biggest problem with this book is that Grace fell into the heroine trap where she is \\"in love\\" to the point where she thinks she will die without her partner (ie New Moon) and looses all personality and spunk in the process. Bleh. Sam is still sad, confused, lost Sam.<br />I still look forward to reading the next book in the series, as I hope the Isabel/Cole story will continue. They seem to have the beginning of an interesting relationship. Cole is a very complex as a character, fighting his way out of nothingness. Isabel is still strong and opinionated.<br /><br />My Recommendation<br />Fans of Shiver will enjoy the continuation of the story, but this probably isn't a great read as an introduction to the series. 3/5 - Rent it/Borrow it
B001QOGYFO|4.0|Something about cold environments I find chilling in more than one way. A perfect setting for a mystery. Why did Russians fight to the death on an airplane fifty years ago? Why does the body count go up when some scientist digging for core samples in the Antarctic find the plane? Who all is involved in killing people? Whose the masked guy with the ice axe trying to take your head off? All these and more questions will be answered by the conclusion of the movie. From the cutesy picture on the cover I fully expected some overly cute woman to pander to the camera as she trotted around half naked trying to do a job she was ill suited. Well whomever designed the cover should be slapped as it does the movie an injustice. This is a genuine well done mystery in the Antarctic with good story, directing, acting, sets, music, et cetera. From some of the reviews I thought it might stink but I was impressed with it and glad I rented it. This US Marshal, well played by Kate Beckinsale, is no slouch and she comes complete with a back story as to why she is stationed in such an inhospitable environment. When they find a body on the ice she is suspicious of it's condition as she has seen one similar in a much warmer clime. She is nearly killed on a few occasions as she tries to discover what someone is hiding and why they are killing people at the outposts. If you enjoy mysteries I suggest you at least rent this one and leave any preconceptions behind before hitting play. Good quality DVD, but only some language choices included. If you enjoyed this catch [[ASIN:B0009YA3OA Mindhunters]].<br /><br />CA Luster

I am not a pessimist but a realist. Childbirth is going to be uncomfortable(notice I did not use the word painful) and this book paints the picture that it is completely painless! Give me a break! I may have learned 1 valuable thing throughout the entire book. I am going to stick to \\"Active Birth\\" and \\"Ina May's Guide to Childbirth\\" which are more realistic books! This book just did not cut it for me!
B003A4IFGY|5.0|I was blown away by Tom Petty's latest release.  The depth and variation in the styles of music on this disc made me wonder if it was conceived as an homage to Tom's musical roots.      Oddly, no one track stands out for me.  I like them all (and I am not a \\"Pettyhead\\") very much.  While it is not a concept album, I like listening to it as a whole, going from one musical world to another with gusto.  I have listened to it multiple times and with all the great music out there today, that is saying a lot.    This collection of songs is a prime example of Tom Petty's \\"Mojo\\".      Buy this disc if you like anything Tom has done.  Buy this disc if you are a fan of eclectic Rock and Roll and you want to go on a tour of Petty's musical genius.  Buy this disc and enjoy yourself!
B003O85W3A|5.0|Arcade Fire has been mining the emotional turmoil of adolescence since its debut in 2004, and though the cause of that turmoil has once again changed, the message is, as always, the same. I'm not one of those people that thinks that everything Arcade Fire has done has been peerless and flawless: I think Arcade Fire is a good band that makes good albums with a handful of truly brilliant songs, nothing more and nothing less. The Suburbs is, as some of the song titles would suggest, a sprawling work, and not without its flaws, but there is plenty of reward for those willing to stick it out for the 60+ minutes. Perhaps working too tightly on the theme of \\"the suburbs,\\" the album has a tendency to be repetitive, which is not surprising given the album's length and the number of Part 1/Part 2 songs on the record. Though it suffers from some of the same problems like the Decemberists' bloated The Hazards of Love, namely strict adherence to a not entirely warranted theme, the Suburbs sets itself apart by having a number of truly excellent songs. Modern Man and Sprawl II are definitely among the best songs Arcade Fire have written, but having a propulsive drive that demands stomping in time with the beat and belting out the words. It should have been obvious all along that Arcade Fire was not going to top their (somewhat over-loved) debut, Funeral, but on the Suburbs, the band has stayed true to its sound and made the logical next step.
0316067938|4.0|First I would like to say that I really enjoyed reading the Twilight Series I read all five and a half books (I started with Midnight Sun online & also read Bree Tanner). Being a Mom of 3 and getting distracted by life in general it was nice to escape everyone around me and do something for myself by myself. I have to say thank you to S. Meyer for giving me this small gift. I actually immediately went to my local bookstore to buy BD since I couldn't wait for my paperback to be delivered. I hate to say that I was a little disappointed by the honeymoon because of all the tension and desire building in the first three books and in Midnight Sun, I wasn't expecting graphic porn-like love making because I know the target audience and I wouldn't want to see graphic smut in the book but something more than a fade to black after a midnight skinny dip would have been nice... at least something romantic leading to the bedroom festivities. The idea of her pregnancy I thought was nice but the alliance with Rose kinda made me uncomfortable because Rose's character seems like a selfish (insert colorful word here) and Bella's attitude and manner towards those who really truly loved and cared about her made me ache. I did enjoy Jacob's section, it was the levity the story needed UNTIL the birth..... I was physically sickened by the way it was written (literally... I had a few bathroom breaks) I would have expected some sort of finesse with the birth since S. Meyer is a Mom herself and the target audience is young (effective birth control for sure). The manner in which she was turned was not pretty either but I understood it's necessity. Jacob's imprinting did not shock me because of the back story of baby Claire and another pack brother. It was the only way Jacob and Bella could be together forever without her hurting him anymore. Also, since so much info was given on possible immortality for the wolves, how sturdy they were, and how quickly Reneesme was growing, she made every attempt to make it not as creepy as it really could have been. I saw why S. Meyer had to make the sacrifices and the exceptions to her rules... because her characters demanded it... unfortunately Rose included because she played Mommy while Bella was in transformation hell. I didn't like that Charlie was given some form of \\"pass\\" and I think more sacrifice for this part of Bella's life should have been made... love has heartbreaking sacrifices and isn't as perfect as it has been written in this series, something S. Meyer knows since she loves Wuthering Heights, etc. I just wished there was more realism to what that first love is... IT HURTS! More than just the physical pain Bella had to go through but it hurt mentally and emotionally as well, she should have lost Charlie and Renee but taking comfort in their new happiness with Sue Clearwater and the new hubby.     Overall, I have to thank S. Meyer for her books but I just wished she didn't make it all so perfect in the end, it would have been more real for her readers, especially the young girls out there who are now searching for their own Edwards... who don't exist. Love is about compromise and heart ache... without the bad the wonderful wouldn't be so sweet.

If you like a book that transports you into the very pages you are reading this book should not be missed. There is no need to go over the storyline of the book, it is a natural progression from The Hunger Games. I am looking forward to book three, and Ms. Collins future works.
030745455X|5.0|\\"Fire' is far better than `tattoo', which is not to say that the first novel in the Millenium series was bad.  It was different in kind and I prefer the second type of novel.  `Tattoo' is a generational detective story with lots of atmospherics and layer upon layer of texture.  `Fire' is a suspense thriller.  The characters are essentially unchanged, but the feel of the second book is totally different.<br /><br />In The Girl Who Played With Fire we are still encountering `men who hate women' (the original title of the first book) or at least men who treat women viciously.  Some would run in fear from such men.  And then there's Lisbeth Salander, who packs up her taser, her can of mace and her pistol and goes hunting for payback.  In this story the bad guys are human traffickers and the leader of the gang has a personal relationship with Salander.  A graduate student and her journalist partner are exposing the gang as well as their clientele.  They turn up dead and Salander is suspected of killing both of them, along with her nasty guardian.<br /><br />Multiple groups investigate: the police, aided by members of Salander's old security firm and the team from Millenium, led by Blomkvist.  The result is that Salander is not only hunting the criminals, she must also avoid the hunters looking for her.  She disappears for part of the book and is felt by her absence, because no one can talk about anything but her.  The hunting/hunted plot is a standard one (see, e.g., Jonathan Kellerman's excellent book, Billy Straight) and Larsson milks it well.<br /><br />While `Tattoo' is more Val McDermid, `Fire' is more Jeffery Deaver, with nice plot twists, a piledriving intensity and a lovely interlacing of the multiple plot strands, culminating in a mini-apocalypse of violence.  Guess who walks away victorious.<br /><br />Highly recommended.  You should start with `Tattoo', which you will still enjoy, but look forward to `Fire' for dessert.
0345440900|5.0|This book made a huge difference in my life. I had read several books before having my baby, but started reading this one a couple of weeks after my baby's birth. I wish I had read it beforehand! Once I learned how to read my baby's cues and figured out what kind of baby I had, things were so much easier. I felt empowered after reading this book and not so helpless. I love the E.A.S.Y. routine, it works great for my baby. He started sleeping through the night between 6 and 7 weeks and now at 3 months sleeps 10-11 hours a night and also takes good naps.<br /><br />I know some people complained that she didn't make a big enough deal out of breastfeeding, but I found it refreshing that she didn't try to make people who don't breastfeed feel awful. Unfortunately for me, my milk never came in despite working with a lactation consultant and doing everything in my power to make it work. It was very emotional and difficult for me to not be able to breastfeed, this book helped me feel not quite so terrible about it.<br /><br />Obviously, different things work for different babies but this works wonderfully for mine. I am personally not a big fan of the whole attachment parenting thing and also not a fan of a strict schedule so this book was perfect for me and it works for my baby. I would highly recommend this book to any new mom or mom to be.
1934137197|1.0|I always pick up the latest pulitzer winner, and I usually love a book with beautiful prose and no action--but this book was insufferable from beginning to end (even at under 200 pages). The characters were not sympathetic, there was no real sense of place, and the offset details on clock fixing and the making of bird nests were distracting to the \\"story\\" (which was already lacking plot elements). I hope the committee did a better job with the nonfiction selection, which I plan to start next.

B003TZ9EGO|3.0|Of the hundred or so remixes that have been commissioned for Lady Gaga songs over the relatively short span of her career thus far, the 10 tracks presented here are by no means the best of the bunch. In fact, as a general observance which has earned me negative ratings in other reviews I've written, despite being the definitive of good pop music, Gaga's songs seem terribly difficult to remix as 90% of what ends up on her maxi-singles is garbage. But, if you're a fan and, like me, have collected all her domestic singles up to this point and still haven't learned your lesson (lol...just kidding), this album proves to still be an essential part of your collection as over half of the mixes presented here are previously unreleased or otherwise unavailable in the US.<br /><br />But on the other hand, if you really are that huge of a Gaga fan, then you probably have already paid a little bit more for the European version of \\"The Remix\\" which has been out for a few months already, and includes the ten tracks here plus seven more. For that alone the US version loses some credit. Had they chosen better remixes for this compilation, rare or not, I would be a little more forgiving of the short running time. But the fact we're getting something at all on this side of the ocean is acknowledged and appreciated, even if it does feel halfhearted. Once the plusses and minuses are all taken together, I figure it balances out to a middle of the road, three star rating. As the Lady herself would say, \\"Eh.\\"<br /><br />Now, normally I hate reviews that offer a track by track breakdown of a CD, but as remix albums are pretty hit or miss I thought I'd give everyone a brief heads up about what exactly they're in for.<br /><br />1. Just Dance (Richard Vission Remix) - I thought it odd to kick off the CD with a dub mix, but it has Vission written allover it while keeping the basic beat of the original. Previously available on US maxi.<br /><br />2. Poker Face (LLG vs GLG Radio Mix) - Very, VERY similar to the album version, with a simple, thumping house beat layered over it. Not bad, but not very ambitious either, and too short to be memorable.<br /><br />3. Lovegame (Chew Fu Ghettohouse Remix feat. Marilyn Manson) - Now here's a great club beat, but it does go a little overboard on the repetitive vocal bits. Seems amateurish. Manson's parts are awesome, I just wish he was featured on more verses.<br /><br />4. Eh, Eh (FrankMuzik Remix) - A house/industrial reworking of the fluffy original with some interesting vocal effects, I'm glad to see some experimentation with an otherwise underrated song. However for its sole representation on this album, I might have gone with the Pet Shop Boys Mix.<br /><br />5. Paparazzi (Stuart Price Remix) - Pretty low-key for a Stuart Price remix, but I believe it uses alternate studio vocals that give it a slightly different vibe from the original. Decent, but again, I might have chosen a more energetic interpretation for this compilation, such as the Moto Blanco mix.<br /><br />6. The Fame (Glam as You Remix) - More or less a sped-up techno version of the original, with a harder, rockstar edge to it. Cute and fun.<br /><br />7. Bad Romance (Starsmith Remix) - As no remix could ever do justice to the original, with only the Chew Fu H1N1 mix coming remotely close, we'll settle for this awkward part retro, part futuristic reworking of the worldwide smash which in the end is surprisingly unremarkable.<br /><br />8. Telephone (Passion Pit Remix) - I admit I'm somewhat disappointed this already available mix ended up here. Too many choppy, wacky vocal effects for my taste. And Lady Gaga on helium? In 2010 I think we can do better than that.<br /><br />9. Alejandro (Sound of Arrows Remix) - Short and simple dance mix for a great song. Certainly better than anything else on the Alejandro remix single, which it is also on, even if it does sound like the backing track to a Mario Brothers video game.<br /><br />10. Dance in the Dark(Monarchy Stylites Remix) -It's a little more mellow and stripped down than the original, with a simple dance beat in the background. Some verses are cut, but what is here certainly does show that Lady Gaga can sing.a simple dance beat in the background. Some verses are cut, but what is here certainly does show that Lady Gaga can sing.
B003TZ9EGO|5.0|This cd is awesome. I was so set on not buying this album because she has released three albums with a lot of the same same songs on them. This is the first album that I bought that has nothing but remixes on the them. My favorite song on the album is paparazzi. I love the original recording of the song but I would have to say that the remix in my opinion is better. I would recommend this album if you are a gaga fan and want to dance.

0425188809|2.0|Dang. Maybe my expectations were too high, because I'm already a DK fan (his Frankenstein was awesome) and I know that Watchers is one of his most acclaimed works. Regardless, I just couldn't get into this one. I kept expecting edge-of-your-seat suspense, but I found my mind wandering as I read descriptions of wooded areas and such. I finally couldn't bring myself to pick the book back up after 50 pages, so I decided to give up. I'm pretty sure the fault here is mine - I am so easily bored, and perhaps I didn't have the patience to wade through the details to get to the meat of the story. But I did give up nonetheless, so the best I can rate this book is two stars. Sorry Mr. Koontz - please don't send any monsters after me!
B003O85W3A|4.0|The Arcade Fire is a band which is one of the best indie rock representitives these days. After especially acclaimed 'The Funeral' and yet no worse follow-up 'Neon Bible', 'The Suburbs' was very anticipated and predicted to be one of the best of the year. From the four pre-released songs one could say that the new record will be as same as different and surely as good as the previous gems.<br /><br />'The Suburbs' surprises and at the same time gently reminds how the band sounded before, as if the new record was just a continuum of their earlier work. However, 'The Suburbs' is quite a new direction of Arcade Fire if to compare in deeper analysis than the general sound. While the last record 'Neon Bible' was foggy and intense, rough and experimental, 'The Suburbs' in comparison is lighter and easier to get on with. As it goes with the cover of the album, this album is more of a cloudless and warm day and no ocean of noise is round the corner.  Yet if to be true, 'The Suburbs' has its own melancholy moments.<br /><br />The album has a length of one hour which is more than ten minutes longer than each of the other albums. However, to be honest this album went through lot quicker than 'Neon Bible' did. The songs are at the right length, the music flows and it is just your bussiness to catch up with.<br /><br />Even though 'The Suburbs' have a little bit more pop tunes, more woman vocals than ever, sometimes even a choir-like sound, but the album stays on track and does not lose its style and whatever you like the most about the Arcade Fire. All in all, I believe that the Arcade Fire produced another very solid album which should not let any fans down and, whatsoever, tame many more.<br /><br />Key tracks:<br />- The Suburbs<br />- Rococo<br />- Half Light I<br />- We Used To Wait<br />- Sprawl II
B000AYQJ3I|5.0|I saw this movie at a small movie house when it first came out in 1971. It has many of my favorite all-time performers, like Leon Russell, Eric Clapton, Bob Dylan and, of course, George Harrison. I really like the extras with this DVD that I never saw before. Interviews with Clapton, Leon, Ringo Starr and some songs not in the original movie, makes this an incredible Video that I'll watch over and over. I believe George was the best Beatle!
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Brandon Sanderson's Mistborn trilogy has been a surprisingly good read, and the final volume, Hero of Ages, ends the series in a way I never quite expected. The edge hard science fiction has always had over the other speculative genres has been its ability to comment on contemporary life through a high concept setting.  Epic fantasy tends to be a simpler affair, focusing on the black and white battle between good and evil over examining the human condition. Generally, it's Joseph Campbell recycled, but not so with Hero of Ages. In the final volume of the series, Sanderson deals with issues of faith and atheism, the inconsistencies of organized religion and how normal people can made into martyrs, messiahs and gods.<br /><br />Picking up a year after Well of Ascension, Hero of Ages opens on the cusp of the apocalypse.  The mists, once confined to the night, are staying out longer and longer through the daytime. People exposed to them are struck down by a mysterious illness or killed, and the ash mounts are throwing a near-constant spray of ash into the atmosphere. As Vin and Elend seek out clues left behind by the Lord Ruler that may hold the secret for saving the world, Spook, Sazed and TenSoon all have trials of their own to overcome.<br /><br />The various character arcs converge on an endpoint that is moving, haunting and ultimately satisfying. The action sequences are as exhilarating as in previous volumes, and although some of the characterization can come off a bit flat at times, the greater subtext of the series, as well as the revelations regarding the nature of the mists, allomancy and the world itself have real resonance.<br /><br />I fear saying anything more would give too much away, but the Mistborn trilogy isn't just a great series, it also heralds the arrival of a massive (and prolific) talent. Brandon Sanderson is the real deal -- I can't wait to read his contributions to the Wheel of Time, as well as his upcoming novel, the Way of Kings. Once you get to the end of Mistborn you'll understand just how serious he is as a writer -- this is a man who walks shoulder to shoulder with George R.R. Martin. No mean feat, given how many authors have failed to live up to the comparison.you'll understand just how serious he is as a writer -- this is a man who walks shoulder to shoulder with George R.R.

B001Y8WAJQ|1.0|Warning, I just picked this one up Denim & Leather thinking it was a new remastered version, it's not. The sound is poor. This does not sound remastered to me at all, very low volume, you really have to turn the sound up and it's very thin with too many highs.<br />Save your money on all these 80's reissues from Saxon 2009.<br />One star for the sound Five stars for the music.
B003O86MY8|4.0|I got this CD as soon as I saw the amazon ad for it. His earlier CD David Garrett was mind-blowing (and I am a grandma!) and I was anxious to play this when it arrived. Okay, so DG is a brilliant violinist and it shows on this album. BUT I doubt he had much to do with the production end of it. He does some great arrangements but some of the cuts here lack his usual vitality. What is most disappointing, though, is the editing. Poor sound quality,  the mixing borders on horrible. This is studio work of the worst kind. My feeling is that his producers wanted to rush this out in prep for the spectacular DVD Rock Symphonies available now only from PBS (for the usual overprice donation).<br /> What I want to say most of all here is that if you saw the DVD on PBS, don't expect this CD to be made of cuts of the live performance. The two media only have a name and a very few cuts in common. And none of the jaw-dropping fervor. After hearing DG Live in Berlin, I bought the CD and waited for the release of the DVD, again, a much superior product. \\"It is not available.\\" on amazon and PBS doesn't have it either. Huh???????????? Maybe if we all scream, his record label will issue a CD of the Rock Symphonies DVD ....<br />Perhaps it's that some of the excitement about hearing his virtuosity is lost without his obvious delight in playing toe to toe with his bass guitarists and other members of his orchestra in a live venue. His duet with Orianthe is lackluster on this CD; it is a powerhouse on the DVD.<br />So why four stars instead of three? For those who want more (actually, less for us fans since there are only a few cuts)exposure to this kind of music, you can hear a few great licks sampled here and do ITunes. But to hear the real artist, buy the David Garrett CD. I have several earlier ones, including those for Deutchgrammaphon where he is strictly classical -- and younger. You can see why he is the longtime favorite of Europeans.<br />Finally, here are some cuts not included in this CD: Schubert' Serenade a la Garrett style, I'll Be There and Billie Jean with Orianthe in a killer performance,Mission Impossible, Child's Anthem, the Pretenders' I'll Stand by You, Zorba, Albinioni's Adagio, Grieg's Peer Gynt Last Movement, and a poignant Hey, Jude where his 13K audience sings to his mike as he plays.<br />For others of a certain age, his inspriration for combining classical music with rock are U2, Nirvana, Aerosmith, Michael Jackson, the Beatles. But, in a short interview, he says he really bases his selections on the great artists who play their instruments with precision and passion, notably the bass guitars. If you love Beethoven, Bach, Brahms, and the Baroque, you will be delighted with this man's work, a classically trained prodigy who was mentored at Julliard by Izak Perlman.<br />If you love the violin, you will find DG \\"awesome.\\"<br />I have this CD and it'll go into the glove box of the car.

B003PX85GK|5.0|I was surprised to see so many \\"mediocre\\" reviews of this great album.  I agree with another reviewer that said that this was BOH settling into their sound - which to me, is a southern beach-boy's-esqu sound.  If you liked the harmonies and springy guitars of the other albums, I think you will find this album quite satisfying.<br /><br />There are several highlights that carry this album.  \\"Older\\" is my favorite, using a twangy Telocaster that reminded me of a classic country song, mixed with BOH's lyrics and vocal harmonies - which meld perfectly.  \\"Blue Beard\\" is the best song on the album to me - the epitome of BOH's vocal talent.  This is what sets this band apart from others - the beauty of their vocals, ranging high and low, yet sounding effortless.  Lastly - I really like \\"Dilly\\" which sounds much different that what BOH usually put out - it reminds me of a \\"Nada Surf\\" song from their album \\"Let Go.\\"  It's spacey, yet pop-py - it uses synth and it sounds more 90's than other stuff BOH does - it's not for everyone but its a solid fun track.<br /><br />All in all, I love this album - and feel that there are too many gems to write this off as a \\"3 star album.\\"  \\"Older\\" and \\"Blue Beard\\" are two of Band of Horses's best songs.

0312117337|4.0|I bought this set of cards on a whim, as my friend is interested in tarot card readings, and I was looking for a product with good reviews on Amazon.com. Since this is my first experience owning and reading from tarot cards (for fun, mostly), I can't say whether or not this deck gives better readings than others. However, the fact that these cards are based on Zen/Buddhist teachings is inspiring, and most of the pictures are visually stunning in a \\"New-Agey\\" and colorful way (with the exception of a few \\"cartoon-y\\" images of cards in the deck that weren't nearly as impressive). The fact that there is a \\"The Master\\" card of this Osho guru guy, who is supposed to be a \\"Master\\" of some Zen Commune in India (but who is now deceased), is rather shamelessly iconic and self-promoting in my view, and seems a bit disingenuous; other than that, the cards can give some entertaining and vaguely relevant readings, and can also help one meditate on various findings within a spread. However, given these are not \\"traditional\\" tarot cards makes me wonder if I would get better readings from a more true-to-form tarot deck (those of the Rider-Waite or Thoth decks). Since these cards are very \\"light-hearted\\" and inspiring in nature, I wanted to try a deck that was more dark, brooding, and Gothic, so I've also ordered the Deviant Moon Tarot cards for comparison. I am hoping that I can get a different, and perhaps more straighforward and less meditative, perspective from a deck that isn't as focused on being inspirational. I will post a review as soon as I receive that deck.
0765318741|5.0|Synopsis: The world has been taken over by a powerful virus, leaving one man alone to fend for himself. Robert Neville is the apparently the last man on earth, with every other human being either dead or undead (infected by a virus causing vampire-like qualities). Neville is completely alone, while the vampires outside taunt him relentlessly. He develops a routine to gathering supplies and experimenting on sleeping vampires during the day, and then locks himself in at night. This may make it seem like a simple story, however each chapter brings in a little twist.<br /><br />Thoughts: I read this book before watching the movie or even knowing what it was about (if that's even possible)... It turned out to be one of the most engaging books I have ever read--there was rarely a time when I could put it down. Every part of the story is fascinating. Neville is the last man alive, so you read what he is thinking and feeling rather than experiencing it through dialogue or character description. You read about how lonely he feels, how hopeless he feels because of the loneliness, the excitement he feels when he sees a stray dog, the unease when he comes in contact with another human, etc. You are in his head the entire time, and so you feel every emotion he is going through. The only problem I had with the book was the ending. (For my thoughts on the ending, scroll to the end of this post). This story is a must-read. The character of Neville is so thoroughly ingrained as a part of the reader that every action he takes seems real. His obsession with researching the virus and finding a cure will be able to explain every vampire novel (or movie) you have ever read (or seen).<br /><br />There are also many short stories contained in this book:<br /><br />Buried Talents: a man is surprisingly skilled at a carnival game.<br />-The description and repetition will bring the story alive. This was my favorite story.<br /><br />The Near Departed: a man plans his wife's funeral<br />-Very creepy!<br /><br />Prey: a voodoo doll comes alive<br />-This one started out very exciting, but I lost interest about halfway through. The ending was predictable.<br /><br />Witch War: Young girls create war<br />-I didn't enjoy this one very much.<br /><br />Dance of the Dead: Young college students visit a nearby town to party<br />-This one was especially creepy, but I had a hard time staying interested.<br /><br />Dress of White Silk: A little girl narrates and describes how she misses her mother<br />-This one was creepy, particularly because young children were involved. I don't think I really understood the ending.<br /><br />Mad House: A man's anger transfers to the house he lives in.<br />-I had a hard time getting into this one because of the repetitive introduction, but I quickly grew interested as the story went on. This is one of the longer short stories, so there was more detail and the story was more developed.<br /><br />The Funeral: A vampire wants a proper funeral.<br />-This one was actually funny. A vampire wants to have a real funeral and invites all of his monster friends.<br /><br />From Shadowed Places: A man must be cured of an African curse<br />-At first this one was interesting, but then when it got into the cure I was a bit turned off. It just wasn't interesting to me.<br /><br />Person to Person: A man can't get rid of the ringing in his head.<br />-A man hears an unexplainable ringing in his head every night at the same time. His therapist insists it's a psychological problem, but the man believes it's something real. The ending is creepy.<br /><br />**SPOILER**<br /><br />*<br />**<br />***<br />****<br />*****<br />****<br />***<br />**<br />*<br /><br />I didn't like that the people of the \\"new\\" society were merely finding<br />ways to remain human (and just live with their disease). I feel like it<br />would have been interesting to see them develop a completely new<br />society that lived during the night and slept in the day.Because if<br />they just wanted to live with the virus, then what was the point of<br />using supplements to try and suppress it? And why get rid of everyone<br />from the \\"old\\" society if they are just trying to be more like them?<br /><br />[...].t trying to be more like them?        [...].

B002ZG980U|3.0|Note: In an ideal world, I would grant this film a 4.5 rating just for its originality, however, I believe that such a high rating would simply mask my objections to parts of this film.<br /><br />Inception marks a return for Christopher Nolan, as he takes a break from the superhero world of DC comics and jumps back into his comfort zone: the human mind. Anyone following Nolan's career will be already familiar with Memento. Memento and Inception, conceptually different, are similar in their approach to filmmaking. Above anything else, both are mind blowing experiences with extraordinary concepts that only someone like Nolan, in this visceral blockbuster era, could conceive. I found his Batman output notable, but, of course, he was attempting to give new life to a franchise that for long seemed doomed for light entertainment. Here, he is back in his comfort zone, creating and developing inventive concepts from sketch.<br /><br />Describing the plot of Inception in such a short space would be both difficult and inadequate. Inception is a journey within the depths of the human mind, via a process named extraction, accessing the most obscure and fascinating concept: dreams. Through the tools at hand, the characters are able to enter the dreams of others and understand the secrets of the subject via their subconscious. However, the subconscious is not only occupied with the subject and the \\"intruder,\\" as its limitless scope and design allows for countless different and eclectic additional characters and objects. In addition, some people have been trained against such invasions, and have a particularly strong and proficient defense system.<br /><br />The protagonist of the tale is Dominic Cobb, played by Leonardo Di Caprio, who is a successful and intelligent extractor. His personal and professional troubles have for a time forced him to live outside of the United States, away from his children. Accepting the fact that he possibly will never see his children, for he would be arrested and jailed for many years if he were to return to the country, he decides to lay low and eventually get work in another country. However, a wealthy man, Saito, whom he is familiar with due to prior extraction missions, offers him a final job. This job, however, is more challenging than any extraction they have ever performed. On this mission, they must incept the mind of Robert Fischer, heir to a wealthy corporation. Robert Fischer's father is close to death, and Saito wants to make sure that his corporate rival disintegrates the company. As a result, they must incept his mind, and grant him new ideas about his relationship with his father and Godfather, Peter Browning. For the completion of this task, they use sedatives that would grant them to dream within the dreams. They eventually are able to get close enough to Robert to enter his dreams. Unfortunately, even with all their preparation, they experience countless setbacks that endanger the mission and their life outside of the dream world.<br /><br />If inception failed in character and story development, acting, directing, cinematography, and many other aspects of the film it still would be an undeniably original concept. Though it will be compared to The Matrix, and possibly Dark City, this film is more original in its jargon, while something like the Matrix was largely influenced by countless different schools of philosophy. The concept of the dreams is unique and entirely original, and in years to come it will be imitated but never bettered. Many studies have shown that the vocabulary of British films have for long been more widespread than American films. Inception may be an exception. Instead of focusing on the F word, which films of all genres have for long found an affinity for, Inception actually uses some elaborate terms-at least for a Hollywood film. This is not necessarily an intellectual film, as it is entirely fictional. However, Inception's pseudo-intellectuality still makes the viewer think and see if Inception's own rules are logically applied. This is a visceral experience, like Transformers, but our mind is constantly active, trying to interpret all the countless information and new ideas that Nolan throws our way.<br /><br />As you see, I have quite an affinity for this genuinely inventive films, so, why the seemingly derogative heading? This film, possibly due its ingenuity, has been compared to Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey. In ways, it is unfair to compare the acclaimed science-fiction film to an exceptional Hollywood blockbuster. Maybe, just as the detractors of 2001 decreased by numbers, Inception's critic may have to eat their words in the foreseeable future. However, there is a place where the comparison is applicable. Kubrick's film is possibly the most implicit film ever created, where nearly every segment has countless interpretations and the film rarely shows us its explicit side. In 2001, Kubrick created an entirely implicit experience, unexpected of the director of Spartacus and Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. Many years after the first film, Arthur C. Clark released a sequel, 2010: Odyssey Two, which was eventually adapted. As much as the earlier film was implicit, 2010 was explicit and Hollywood entertainment. Of course, the magic was lost, as it tried direly to make the audience, possibly the ones who were bored by the first film, understand the points only hinted by 2001. Inception is 2010, while it could have more elegantly become 2001. This film is undeniably complex, proven by the fact that Nolan explains every single detail of extraction and inception. We need some information about this original concept, but every part of the process is so heavily explained that it leaves nothing to the imagination. Nolan explains everything to such a degree that we truly feel like observers and outsiders to these characters world. If it had been suggestive in some areas, our intellect could have been truly engaged and this film would have been a true cerebral experience. Unfortunately, we gaze at the film with fascination, trying to always comprehend its thread of complexity. We may be confused at moments, but rarely are we bewilderingly lost in the picture. Unfortunately, Nolan is trapped in the blockbuster world, where studios demand clarity from the narrative. In other words, there is a much more implicit and majestic film buried from the view of the still powerful Inception.<br /><br />Inception may be a blockbuster with expected top-notch actors, but it has much more personality, focus, and drive than the average Hollywood product. The fact that Nolan could have created such an original film in such a predictable era is testament to his immense talent as one of the most fascinating directors of recent times, with only Tarantino as his rival. There has been much talk about the final scene and moments of the film, and its implications. On Inception's Wikipedia page, there appears a solid explanation for the ending but that is unfortunate. If Nolan is not aiming for a sequel, which I hope not, the open-ended ending brilliantly matches, and possibly defines this mystifying film and is proof of the audacity of Nolan's vision.ion's own rules are logically applied.

B000JQU1VS|3.0|Bonus points to The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes for being a free kindle book and for being one of the greatest firsts of its kind.  That being said, the quality of the book is not quiet as \\"timeless\\" as I had hoped.  I read Sherlock Holmes right after finishing Treasure Island and before that, Around the World in 80 Days.  Needless to say, these other \\"classics\\" I had picked up were more impressive than I could have imagined and easily hold their own to anything written in modern adventure/thriller novels.  I wish the Adventures of Sherlock Holmes gave the readers a little more freedom to venture other possible solutions and to really stir the imagination but, sadly, it does not.

B000JML7EC|5.0|Wonderful.  This book is a must read.  This was the first classic I downloaded (for free nonetheless) for my Kindle and could not be more impressed with the quality of the novel.  I expected a sort of lame adventure-Disney pirate hybrid but instead found myself looking forward to each and every turn of the page.  The book is not terribly long (so you won't feel like the author fancies the killing of trees for sport) and keeps a rather good pace of narrating the action.  Treasure Island is a must read.  (A) It's free, (B) You'll knock out reading a classic, and (C) You'll feel all that much more enlightened when you throw up in front of it's namesake hotel in Vegas.  Yarr.

This is not to say there are no serious songs. \\"Me, Myself, and I\\" is heart-breakingly beautiful, in all honesty, I cried the first time I heard it.  \\"Give A Little\\" is probably my favorite song on the album, I've loved it since I saw their live stream of the song on their fanclub.  It's SO much fun and SEXY!  I move every time I hear it. :)  I could go on and on about all the songs, but would rather someone form their own opinion. :)  Oh and this was also my second purchase of the album, for a friend, who is now hoping to attend a concert with me soon.
B000NA28I4|1.0|I've read Mr. Paolini's Inheritance set (so far) at least twice, in an effort to understand the modern development of the various dramatic and literary themes in use for the last 4,500 years - since the earliest Homeric epics, and including Shakespeare, T.H. White, and Tolkien. Paolini has done a marvelous job of incorporating the ancient themes with modern sensitivity. Unfortunately, Messrs. Peter Buchanan and Stefen Fangmeier blew it, in their movie \\"Eragon.\\" The movie fails entirely to develop the lead character, Eragon, and entirely misstates the environment of Alagaësia and the efforts against the immortal king Galbatorix. I realize that \\"film\\" is not the same medium as text, but there's no excuse for omitting most of the motivations and the growth of Eragon as the story progresses. Also, there's next-to-nothing about \\"the rest of the story,\\" no apparent lead-in to the later books, and thus to any later films. (There's really, as yet, no critical difference between film and DVD, as there is between film and stage, or either of those and text.) In my world, not worth the money.

B000PC0U1W|5.0|I am a big fan of anything and anyone that asks WHY.  It is the type of question ridiculed, and least easily answered.  This movie brings to the forefront how a government can quickly go from the minimal required to ensure that free trustworthy citizens can go about their life, to an overprotective, lying, ends justifies the means tyrant system.      I do find it ironic that it takes place in England, a monarchy.  I thought for sure the only better setting would be the republic of the united states of america, or the republic of france.  That is my only critique, as the film does a great job at questioning what is worth losing freedom for...  Money, security?...  These will evaporate, and you will only be left with a tyrant society.  SO WHY do we allow it???      I think I know, but I don't want to be just another person using Amazon reviews to make a political point today.  All in all, it is a great film.  Enjoy...
1591843162|1.0|I agree with the reviewers that say this is an important topic and the basic topic is good.  I just didn't get much from the book.  It did little or nothing to either enlighten me or provide a good working solution to achieve this proposed utopian state of being a Linchpin.     Maybe I'm just cynical after reading enough of the pop psychology of the lizard brain, etc.  But this book did not inspire or educate me to any degree.  But hey all you modern day 'factory workers' beware, you have to be a linchpin or your job will go over seas.    I must admit that Mr. Godin didn't help much when he resorted to quoting Karl Marx to make his case about how to succeed in capitalism.     Either case if you really want to read this book, borrow it from the library (like I did) and read the summary chapters.     I purchase books that provide useful material are timeless classics or I want to read more than once.  This book met none of my criteria.

This book makes you realize how we have to take control of our own health, gaining the knowledge ourselves and not relying only on the medical establishment.  I have already purchased 5 copies to share with loved ones.  This is a MUST READ if you want to live a long and healthy life.
B003HV0TN2|5.0|\\"The name of the wind\\" is described as an epic fantasy story, but it is not what I would describe as epic fantasy in the traditional way. For me epic fantasy is big battle with huge armies where the stake is the fate of the world (just think about the huge battles in \\"Lord of the rings\\". \\"The name of the wind\\" is epic in a different low-key way.<br /><br />Kote is the owner of a wayside inn, outside a little town in the middle of nowhere, and he has a boy of the fairy (what regular people would call a demon) as a helper.  In a regular epic fantasy story, Kote would be a nobody, who suddenly finds himself a part of something much bigger that eventually leads him to save the world with his hidden powers that is somehow revealed. That is not the case here; Kote is not his real name. His real name is Kvothe (pronounced like \\"quothe\\"), and he is already a feared and revered person in the world.<br /><br />There are things in the world that people seldom see, and when Kvothe on night is out taking care of some small spiderlike demons, he saves the life of a man called the Chronicler. He is a travelling scribe, and he has heard rumors about where he could find Kvothe. The Chronicler convinces Kvothe that he should tell him his life story, and then the real story begins. Kvothe's parents was of the Edema Ruh (what we would call gypsy's), and they travel around performing plays in towns. Kvothe's parents are killed by the mythical Chandrian. From there we learn how Kvothe got himself from living on the streets to rise in the ranks of the university.<br /><br />The universe and characters Rothfuss have created are simply amazing. The world feels real and even the magic in the world doesn't feel out of place. Kvothe is a delightful character, and you really fell connected to him. This is just the first book in the series, and the only grievance I have towards the book is that there is no real ending for the first book. It sort of just trickles out and stops abruptly.<br /><br />This is the best fantasy debut I have read since \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" by Scott Lynch, and it is an absolute must read. Nearing the end of the book I was almost sad that it would be over so soon (even though it is a brick of a book). I can't wait to start reading the nest installment in the series, and in the mean time all I can do is send a BIG thanks to Patrick Rothfuss for writing a amazing book.I have read since \\"The Lies of Locke Lamora\\" by Scott Lynch, and it is an absolute must read.

B0000027D5|5.0|Santana's 1973 live album, Lotus, is a fantastic release that puts most live albums, including some of their own, to shame. Recorded during their creative peak, this is not the traditional Santana that most people know. The band's Latin rock sound is now even heavier on the percussion with large doses of funk, similar to what Miles Davis would later do on Agharta and Panagea. Even readings of their standards (\\"Black Magic Woman/Gypsy Queen\\", \\"Oye Como Va\\", etc.) are played with more vigor and fire than usual. Carlos Santana's guitar playing was simply wicked during these performances and the highlights are so many. His solos on \\"Gypsy Queen\\" and \\"Incident at Neshabur\\" are beyond sick. There are tons of instrumentals here, particularly on Disc 2 and there's not a dull moment to be found. Also worth noting is this appears to completely live; warts, feedback, and all. In my opinion, this is one of the five best live recordings ever released. Buy it.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|I am a Trekky fan from the beginning. I use to watch Star Trek on TV in the beginning on a Friday night. I loved it and have loved it and all the others since then. This Star Trek was marvelous. I am waiting for the next one from Amazon.

B001FB55M6|4.0|A quickie warning about the Blu-ray version:<br /><br />I just bought this elsewhere online to pick up at their retail store (hint: it was the *Best* price) and when I got it, I saw that there is no digital copy, EVEN THOUGH THE UPC NUMBER IS IDENTICAL. The original cover art had a sleeve (I think) with \\"Digital Copy (Blu-ray Disc symbol) Special Edition\\" at the top, with Jim Carrey bungee-jumping off a bridge. The newer version that I received is Jim Carrey walking through a field with his arms outstretched.<br /><br />After about an hour of research and wondering if I should return it and start trying again to get it cheap on eBay while avoiding used copies (seller having used the digital copy) or just to keep the darn thing, if you look at Amazon's image of the back cover here and zoom in, it says, \\"(Digital copy) Offer expires April 6, 2010\\".<br /><br />So, kudos to Amazon for having readable back cover art, and BOO! to the studios for limiting digital copy availability and not changing the UPC code. Bad studio, bad!

1439153663|5.0|Wow....could not put this down. Perversely interesting and sad and hopeful.  You'll put it down because you're heart-sick and then you'll pick it up to see what happens next, and near the end you\\"ll throw the book down in disgust and outrage.....yet the ending is hopeful.  It's a good old fashioned page turner: there are villains, and heroines, and heros, and slimeballs, and sickos.  You\\"ll cheer, you'll jeer, and your kids will eat frozen pizza for a few days!  A GREAT READ!
B000002OVJ|5.0|This is the best live rock and roll album of all time.  Second is Ya-ya by the Stones.  Most live rock albums you listen once and then okay<br />you heard it.  But this one can be played over and over again and it is still a thrill to hear it.  Nothing comes close.
B003O85W3A|5.0|For album number three, Arcade Fire sound joyous and melodic with a slight retro feel. 16 tracks long, the first few songs have a warm familiar feel; the jangly title track (reprised at the end in a brief haunting drone), the sunny \\"Ready to start\\", or \\"Modern man\\" with slightly askew beats. Win Butler handles most of the lead vocals on the album.<br /><br />The two part \\"Half light\\" (\\"I need the darkness, can you please cut the lights?\\" go the lyrics in part) is where things start to veer off in different directions; the first part a tender string-swathed ballad, the second \\"No celebration\\" a pulsing Synth-driven affair. \\"Suburban war\\" is a jangly tempo-shifting cinematic piece with haunting harmonies, while \\"Month of May\\" is frenetic Punk, a watershed of sorts.<br /><br />The Beatles-esque \\"Deep blue\\" has a plodding gait with ethereal vocals, while \\"Sprawl\\" is a two part epic; the first \\"Flatland\\" a Morricone-style dramatic ballad with Win turning in a melodramatic croon (absolutely stunning), and the second \\"Mountains beyond mountains\\" an upbeat ABBA Disco-style ditty with R&eacute;gine Chassagne on vocals.<br /><br />\\"The suburbs\\" is an enthralling album, better taken as one piece with various movements, as unlike its predecessors, there aren't really any obvious standouts like \\"Wake up\\" (from \\"Funeral\\") or \\"Ocean of noise\\" (from \\"Neon bible\\"). Their upward trajectory continues.
B0036EH3XE|1.0|I was a huge fan of Lost for 5 seasons.  Then came Season 6.  This was by far the worst of the six seasons.  In fact, in hindsight I wish I didn't waste my time watching the show.  For five seasons, the writers brought up many questions about the island and the characters.  Unfortunitely, hardly any of these questions are ever answered.  The writers missed a huge opportunitely to make this one of the best shows ever.  Instead, they failed miserably.  I wish I never wasted the time watching six seasons of this non sense.

B002N8A14M|5.0|Bought this item for the arm band, which of very good quality, very comfortable and fully adjustible, but I find that I'm using just the clip on clear plastic case (which clips on the the arm band) by itself more frequently. It's convenient to have the option of using the case with or without the arm band. The case provides excellent protection for the Nano while giving full access to the click wheel and does not have to be removed to charge or sync. The case does however restrict the use of the earphone plug to designs that are the same as the original ear buds supplied with the Nano. All in all the best features of any arm bands I have seen..
B0031R5K68|1.0|Worst of the lot. His other books were ok. But this one made me resign at chapter 109. Could not bear to put up more of this.<br />As others before me have pointed out, it becomes pointless after some time and drags on and on and on. Read the remaining from wikipedia. Thank heavens I did that, if I had read it fully, Mr Brown would have wasted more hours of my life.<br /><br />There is no plot, really!!! Just Robert  running in circles. The style of the narration differs form part to part, one will get the feeling that this books was written by 20 people.<br /><br />Next time Dan, please keep it crispy as the novels before.
B000Y7ZHCU|5.0|The 1st thing I have to say is it came within days, no need to pay the extra postage, 2nd it was 100% perfect condition, two things that are important to most people.  Celine in concert need I say more? Awesome, especially if you have never seen her or her HBO special, your in for a real treat. Haven't watched the 2nd one yet with the making of, but thats a good rainy day thing to do.  Enjoy... hope I helped....
0312370849|5.0|This book was a little slow at the beginning but by the end I was riveted.  It is a tender story and gives an insight into WWII tragedies that occurred in France that I had never learned.  I am anxious to travel to France to visit the places mentioned in the book and to see the monument there that commemorates the Vel d'Hiv.
B003JR1JV0|5.0|At first, I wasn't sure I would love the entire album. I just knew I liked some of Miley's songs from one of her movies. I loved her voice then and found myself curious.    And just as I was thinking I would love to ear more songs from her, her clip 'can't be tamed' went on TV. And, oh my! It was love at first sight (or earing ^^) with this song. The music, the voice, the video. It was quite addicting.    I normally don't buy albums often, and not of an artist I only loved for so short a time. But then, I saw this article, and found the price more than correct fora  Cd/DVD bonus.    So I took my chance. And I fell in love all over again with her voice and her songs, while listening for the first time to this CD........ wich I loved all songs of. It was a first. Every song has it's own 'character' so to speak. Each of them has something that made me dance or sing along. That made me think and made me feel.    For a singer coming from a TV show................... she had quite the potential. But with this. With 'can't be tamed'....... she surpassed all expectation.    The song itself of 'can't be tamed' is club worthy (even if I don't go to clubs to dance ^^). 'Stay' is the one song that made me feel the most (I love calm songs the most ^^)... And I won't tell you anything but: buy this, even if you have doubts. It's really worth it.    The songs are perfect.      The DVD bonus.................. is a BONUS. Seing her concert was amazing. I have favorites singers that I find do it better than her ^^ but it is really great. And for the price it is, better the deluxe edition than the simple CD.       So................ hurry up and buy the deluxe ^^
0307454541|1.0|The only thing good about this book is its title. The story is not interesting, the characters are boring, the dialogue is right out of a book for teenagers.  According to his bio Stieg Larson was a Swedish communist.  This book reads like a book that the communist party might have published to assure proper thinking in high school students.  Don't waste your time on this piece of propaganda.
0439023491|5.0|Suzanne Collins did a great job w/Catching Fire. In many series I've read,the second book isn't nearly as good as the first. But this is a phenominal book and a must read!
B003X73QA8|3.0|I come to this as an outsider - I have previously listened to a few Arcade Fire songs (or watched videos) because of friends who like them.  There was a lot of build up to this release, so when I saw it was only $3.99 I thought I would check it out with little to loose.  Just because I won't give it 5 stars, some will hate this review - fine, but this is my honest opinion.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this album.  But I'm not an uncritical fanboy, so I can't.  Sure, I don't hate it, it isn't bad.  But it isn't special like some would have you believe.  Don't drink that Kool Aid blindly.<br /><br />My favorite part of the album as a whole is the overall ebb and flow of pace and style that keeps it at least interesting and listenable.  It is music you can put on while driving down the road, and then tune out while you think of something else. But that isn't what I want in my music.  I want it to grab me, to change me, to make me feel something, but mostly all I get from this is indifferent meh.<br /><br />Some of the tracks really seem like they are trying to hard to be different.  There is nothing wrong with different, but being different just to be different almost never works out unless your name is Beck.<br /><br />1. The Suburbs - solid start, creative and catchy.<br />2. Ready to Start - R.E.M. does this better.  So did The Cure.<br />3. Modern Man - It's like they stole it from 80's Devo and modernized it.  Not bad!<br />4. Rococo - I like the rich musical sound, but the vocals don't add to it.<br />5. Empty Room - U2 meets Bjork.  Not bad, but not great either.<br />6. City With No Children - U2 does this so much better.<br />7. Half Light I - Modern Pink Floyd - really good!<br />8. Half Light II (No Celebration) - Kinda Faith No More cross with INXS - and I really like it!<br />9. Suburban War - a modern take on acid rock?  Wanted to like it, but can't.<br />10. Month of May - This one should be really high energy in concert, but doesn't seem to translate on the album.<br />11. Wasted Hours - Love it!  Catchy, makes you want to air strum along.<br />12. Deep Blue - This is the rich sound like Rococo, but I like it much better. The vocals add to it here. Probably my favorite track.<br />13. We Used to Wait - Like the lyrics, you can keep the music.<br />14. Sprawl I (Flatland) - Good emotional \\"feeling\\" song.  Easily blends into the background of life.<br />15. Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains) - Ace of Bass?  ABBA?  Really?<br />16. The Suburbs (continued) - Like Neil Young might sound today if he were 35 years younger.  And that's a good thing.  Great end to the album.want to air strum along.  12. Deep Blue - This is the rich sound like Rococo, but I like it much better. The vocals add to it here. Probably my favorite track.  13.

B000001FTD|5.0|1986-87 were big years for fans of heavy metal.  First, Metallica released the legendary MASTER OF PUPPETS; then, Slayer and Megadeth put out REIGN IN BLOOD and PEACE SELLS...BUT WHO'S BUYING? (respectively).  It's not hard to imagine that, in 1987, the bar was set astronomically high for metal fans, but in March of that year, Anthrax not only matched that standard, but arguably exceeded it with AMONG THE LIVING, introducing the world of thrash metal to an interesting alchemy of metal, punk, and pseudo-rap and pioneering a style of thrash all their own.<br /><br />AMONG THE LIVING is characterized by its fast songs, powerful guitar riffs, and political awareness.  The line-up at the time consisted of Scott Ian on rhythm guitar, Joey Belladonna on vocals, Charlie Benante on drums, Frank Bello on bass, and Dan Spitz on lead guitar.  (This incarnation of Anthrax would go on to record two more full-length studio albums and is affectionately known as the classic Anthrax line-up.)  Beginning the album is the title track \\"Among the Living,\\" a quintessential thrash song with its brutal fast pace; Belladonna's energetic vocal performance amplifies the intensity, and Benante's thunderous double-bass patterns (showing that he can hang toe-to-toe with Slayer's Dave Lombardo) tear through the mix to drive the song all the way home.  The second and third tracks are two concert mainstays, \\"Caught in a Mosh\\" and \\"I Am The Law.\\"  The former boasts a growling bass intro leading into another classic thrasher with a simple but catchy refrain; \\"I Am The Law,\\" meanwhile, locks in an early groove and maintains a mid-tempo approach (at least, for a while), giving the song's lyrics (about a \\"bad-ass cop\\") a chance to find its space.<br /><br />While \\"I Am The Law\\" contains strong cultural references (to comic book icon Judge Dredd), \\"Efilnikufesin (N.F.L.)\\" truly makes a statement about 1980s pop culture by revisiting the downfall of cinema star John Belushi.  Anthrax, with a scathing tone, remarks, \\"So funny and smart, so talented./But success just couldn't fit!\\"  References to pop culture would be a signature of Anthrax, showing that the band is never too egotistical to consider its roots and write a song that relates to the people.  Another one of Anthrax's concert mainstays, the sixth track entitled \\"Indians,\\" features a more serious political tone but is nonetheless still a musical heavyweight; the famous \\"war dance\\" breakdown in the middle of the song is absolutely conducive to excessive moshing at Anthrax concerts, making \\"Indians\\" one of the band's most popular tunes with the fans.  \\"One World\\" follows suite with its activist lyrical content (\\"America, stop singing 'Hail to the Chief.'/Instead of thinking 'S.D.I.,' he should be thinking of peace.\\") but mimics the opening track in pace and intensity.  Closing the album out are \\"A.D.I./Horror of it All\\" and \\"Imitation of Life.\\"  \\"A.D.I.,\\" one of Anthrax's many acronym song titles, stands for \\"Arabian Douche Intro,\\" a reference to the exotic acoustic intro of the song (a Dan Spitz original).  \\"Imitation\\" summarizes what a good portion of the thrash movement was all about: To attack and defeat \\"posers,\\" wherever they exist.  Indeed, just as the Bay Area metal bands were rebelling against L.A. glam music, Anthrax in New York ridiculed the concept of \\"selling out\\" to achieve notoriety and money.<br /><br />It has been twenty-three years since the album's release, but Anthrax is still performing songs from AMONG THE LIVING with the same vigor that has always been expected.  Now, with \\"classic line-up\\" vocalist Joey Belladonna back in the band, it's an exciting time to be an Anthrax fan.  As the \\"Big Four\\" tour is commencing in Europe, one has to reflect on what a powerful two-and-a-half decades of metal it has been.  Anthrax has released quite an impressive catalog of music, but if there is one album that can summarize what the band is all about, it is AMONG THE LIVING.  All metal fans must pick it up: You will not be disappointed.p: You will not be disappointed.
B002WIDRM6|5.0|This album is absolutely impeccable! It contains the perfect mix of depressing, slow, tragic, celebratory and upbeat songs that make each listening sound balanced and complete!! I had my doubts that all of these songs could really be worth my money but upon listening to the album multiple times, those doubts drifted away with immense speed! This album is truly a great buy for anyone fond of love songs, country music or happiness in general! I hope that you buy this and I am postive you will not be left with any regrets at all!

B000001DTM|5.0|U2 hit their absolute peak with Achtung Baby, and I really can't come up with a better overall album from start to finish. It had several monster radio hits like mysterious ways, even better than the real thing, one, until the end of the world, etc., but every track is a spellbinder. It somehow manages to be U2'd most catchy, commercial, danceable, darkly mysterious, and emotionally harrowing album ever, all at the same time. It is U2's most stylish album, yet also the most substantive. It is utterly timeless, but also to this day sounds futuristic and ahead of its time. Bono sings like a man possessed, and he effortlessly fills his lyrics with haunting, unforgettable imagery. The songwriting, musicianship, production, and overall soundscape are utterly inspired. It's influential, but nobody's managed to come close to copying it. I've listened to it so many times that is has the familiarity of an old friend, yet I always seem to hear some new enchanting texture.     I could go on and on. In short, Achtung Baby is everything you could ever want in an album.     For this music junkie, I can say that this is probably the lone album that has never EVER fallen out of the rotation after nearly 20 years. As a teen, it was one of the first cds I ever owned, and is the one cd I've always made sure I had in my car, would always play it when kids came over, road trips in college, and then when I got an ipod, always made sure it was on there at all times. Just in case I wanted to listen to it. And I always keep coming back for more.
076780421X|5.0|I didn't really hear about this movie when it was in theatres but saw it on TBS later on.  Such a great movie.  Unrealistic plot but great movie about a leap of faith.  Stuff happens in life that you don't expect or is even outside of your normal behavior and the male role played by Matthew Perry behaves in an admirable manner.

Same for level three. Worth every penny.<br />Pros: quick, solid, workout<br />Cons: music, as with most videos, is lacking.  I play my own tunes, now that I have the workout down.
B001P22HK8|4.0|- As a SciFi / Military reader it is a great book, a little slow through the first chapters, but it's well worth it by the end... Note: It's a cliff hanger ending, so if you can stand that type of ending then buy Freedom(tm) with it...    - As a programmer it one of the better hacker books i have read and of course it's over the top it's SciFi but it's not as annoying as most hacker/programmer books, at least the author get the programmer jargon right so your not constantly popping out of \\"suspended disbelief\\". It seems the author might have talked to a real hacker or two, not script kitty or corp security professionals..    - You maker's fair people out there, this is your dream book :)
B003OF3R0S|2.0|Sorry, I have to be a dissenter. As a fan of Metal/Punk since the mid-70's, and a big fan of CoE & A7x, I think this CD is A7x's \\"Swan Song\\". Over the years, I have noted a very typical pattern to all great bands \\"career arc\\": the 4th Album is where the band loses creative energy, you can only hold \\"lightning in a bottle\\" for so long. It is very evident, after the somewhat controversial 4th A7x CD, that this 5th Album is a \\"post-peak\\" classic case in point. When you combine the bands loss of the Rev, I can only see a slow downward spiral from here on out. The Album is amazingly \\"technically proficient\\" as always, but it feels commercially over-polished to the point where it is more suited be the soundtrack for the next \\"Twilight\\" movie - rather than a standalone Album.  I have now listened to the album several times, and the only song that merits further listening is \\"Fiction\\" - everything else is nearly indistinguishable from a dozen other radio-friendly bands in the same Genre.  Flame rebuttals coming my way in 3...2...1...
B003ICWTR4|5.0|This is the way to capture a Springsteen concert.  Complete show, great camera views that make you feel like you're there.  All the energy from the \\"Working On A Dream\\" tour is captured here.  I'm a really big fan of \\"Live In New York\\" and I have to say, this is probably a close second to that.  The main reason is it's a complete show but the set list is very good as well.  Highly recommend this.
B0036TGSR6|4.0|It's been a while since Polanski has directed a straight-up thriller; THE PIANIST was a superb drama, but it hasn't been since THE NINTH GATE over a decade ago that we've had something taut and suspenseful.  And while THE GHOST WRITER isn't Polanski's best, or even his most suspenseful, it is indeed a superb film that resonates in today's culture.<br /><br />The film follows a ghost writer (Ewen McGregor) as he is hired to write the memoirs of former Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan).  After ensconcing himself in Lang's American retreat, and getting to know Lang's loyal secretary (Kim Cattrall) and wife (Olivia Williams), the Ghost (and the world) discover that Lang is being charged with war crimes.  Are they true?  And what exactly happened to Lang's previous ghost writer, who washed ashore a couple weeks ago?<br /><br />What could easily have been a throw-away political thriller is, in the hands of Planski and novelist/screenwriter Robert Harris, a personal thriller.  Politics are clearly important here (there's no denying this is a Tony Blair allegory), but it's really about the Ghost; and as such, McGregor is forced to carry a lot of this film on his thankfully-capable shoulders.  He turns in a fine performance, one of his best.  Brosnan is surprisingly underused; ever since he cast aside the Bond tux, he's been turning out marvelous performances left and right.  Here's yet another, in the brief screen time he's given.  Cattrall is appropriately menacing; is she merely loyal, or something much worse?  And Olivia Williams is a stunner; her chemistry with McGregor doesn't quite click, but she is in fine-form, turning in a sultry, mysterious performance.<br /><br />The film never entirely digs itself in.  Much as with Polanski's 80s thriller FRANTIC, we never get a real sense of the danger, despite the stellar script, direction, and performances; thus, the ending, while otherwise inevitable (and yet oddly satisfying), comes off as a bit hackneyed.  There's a claustrophobia that just isn't here; we don't feel the Ghost's world closing in upon him.  Still, THE GHOST WRITER is a great thriller from a fantastic director and writer.  It's not Polanski's best, but it's better than a lot of the political thriller wannabes out there.st isn't here; we don't feel the Ghost's world closing in upon him.  Still, THE GHOST WRITER is a great thriller from a fantastic director and writer.  It's not Polanski's best, but it's better than a lot of the political thriller wannabes out there.
0525421580|5.0|WILL GRAYSON, WILL GRAYSON has been sitting on my to-be-read pile for quite some time. Other books kept pushing ahead in line until, finally, I took it off the stack and stuck it in my bag, refusing to look at another book until I'd finished it.<br /><br />At first, I wasn't as enthralled as I'd imagined I'd be. I thought that John Green's Will Grayson was hilarious and I was enjoying the sections he narrated, but I simply couldn't connect with David Levithan's Will. He was just too for me. Too negative, too sarcastic, too much in general. I found him extremely annoying - until he met the other Will Grayson. I can't pinpoint the exact change that occurred, but I know that when the Will Graysons met in that \\"unlikely corner of Chicago,\\" I started to like Levithan's Will, sometimes even more than I liked Green's! *gasp* Once I made a connection with both Will Graysons, my attitude towards the book changed completely. At first, I could easily set the novel down and was distracted by other things, but after, it was nearly impossible to tear my eyes from the page. So, if you've yet to read WILL GRAYSON, WILL GRAYSON, don't give up on it if you aren't connecting with both characters. There's a chance that this will change for you, as it did for me, but, even if it doesn't, this novel is definitely worth finishing!<br /><br />I can't write a review of this novel without mentioning Tiny Cooper, who is both a best friend and love interest in the novel. He was a fabulous character and, of all the characters, I'd have to say that he shines the brightest. I'd love to read a novel from his point of view!<br /><br />Overall, WILL GRAYSON, WILL GRAYSON is a hilarious novel written by two phenomenal authors. It reminded me just how amazing John Green's writing is and has encouraged me to seek out more by David Levithan.
B002ZG9846|4.0|Such is KICK-ASS: over-the-top, hilarious, brutally violent.  It chronicles the rise (if we want to call it that) of the titular hero, whose secret identity is almost a nonentity: Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), a nobody at his high school, pining after a girl who thinks he's gay.  When Dave dons his superhero costume (a green and yellow wetsuit) and starts kicking butt, he becomes an Internet sensation.  But other people take notice: Big Daddy (Nic Cage) and his daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz).  Most noticeably, there's crime kingpin Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), whose son (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) just wants in on the family business, even if it means making a friend and subsequently betraying him.  All of these culminates in a bloody, brilliant show-down.<br /><br />At the heart of KICK-ASS (and there is a heart) is the notion that only social misfits and people unsatisfied with their lot in life would ever don a costume.  No one in this film is perfect; Dave is lost and looking for himself, and both Big Daddy and Hit Girl are sociopaths; they make D'Amico (who microwaves a guy alive) look tame.  But that's the genius of KICK-ASS: it never takes itself seriously, so you never get the idea that it's promoting (or condemning, for that matter) violence.  The film (and graphic novel) just IS: it's here for your entertainment, and make of it what you will.<br /><br />Matthew Vaughn's directing is solid, as is the script; but the film hinges entirely upon the performances, as most films of this kind do.  Graphic violence and dark humor will only get you so far--as evidenced by the fact that the film falls away in the middle, as the violence slowly overtakes the humor.  Thankfully, we have solid performances, mainly from the supporting cast; Johnson is fine, but he couldn't have carried this film alone.  We have Mark Strong as the villain, menacing and hilarious at the same time; Strong has a knack for sinking his teeth into this sort of role.  As D'Amico's son, Mintz-Plasse manages to break out of typecast; he's entirely believable in his role as (first) and ignored son, and then as the masked \\"hero\\" Red Mist.  But it's really the teaming of Cage and Moretz that will be remembered.  Cage is delightfully over-the-top, going from aw-shucks to Dark Knight and back again.  Moretz is a wonder; easily the most controversial part of the film (and that's saying a lot, considering the level of violence here), she spouts obscenities and slits throats with a grace that's rarely seen in these films (also in time with the requisite rock 'n roll soundtrack; Vaughn getting his Tarantino on).  It's Hit Girl this film will be most remembered for, but really, the whole cast deserves a round of applause.  Even with the stellar source material, even with a fine script and directing and choreography, this film could easily have tanked.  As is, it stands as a great entry into the superhero cannon, both parodying the genre and trying to explain some of its appeal.  It is dark, laugh-out-loud hilarious, and violent: everything you could want on a Friday night.break out of typecast; he's entirely believable in his role as (first) and ignored son, and then as the masked \\"hero\\" Red Mist.

0671027573|5.0|Four women get together to create a list of qualities in their Perfect Man. Drama and hilarity ensues as a killer sees the list as a taunt to his perfection. Detective Sam Donovan lives next door to one of the \\"list ladies\\", Janie Bright. Janie is one of the most fun, brilliant characters I've read about in forever. She has a sarcastic sense of humor and a killer wit. Sam Donovan is an alpha male with all the right moves.     Read this book. You will NOT be disappointed! I have read everything Ms. Howard has ever written, and this is heads and shoulders above the rest. The only other books that this could compare with is her Mackenzie series. Honestly, Sam reminds me a bit of Zane Mackenzie.
1597801585|3.0|As a teacher, I know that futuristic books fascinate young adults (middle and high school), and I am always on the look out for new novels. This book was recommended on a high school book website. I was looking forward to reading this novel based on its interesting concept that calories, something that people try to cut out of their diets today, are more important than money in the future. While that was touched upon, the story became lost in the concept of the Windup Girl herself, who is a fascinating, futuristic being and worth the story in herself.  What I wasn't expecting was a very disturbing, graphic rape scene early in the book, with other salacious and violent sexual scenes interspersed without.  In no way would I recommend this book to anyone under the age of 18.  Concept-- great, but for adults.

B003A4IFGY|4.0|I graduated from high school in 1977, so Tom Petty & the Heartbreakers are part of the soundtrack of my youth and young adulthood. Loved what I heard but didn't buy until I picked up Full Moon Fever (on vinyl). (My younger brother had the Petty albums so I listened to his!!!) Now I hear that Tom is releasing a new CD of blues songs with the Heartbreakers, recorded live in the studio. Music to my ears. My wool is dyed blue and I mostly enjoy classic rockers who record blues albums. These guys learned how to play by listening to blues albums, and I'll argue to my last breath that Petty & the Heartbreakers incorporated blues into even their biggest hits. So usually these little projects turn out OK, sometimes they are bad, and sometimes they are great. Three have been released this year. Steve Miller's attempt is so-so but listenable. Most of Cyndi Lauper's blues is OK but some is barely tolerable. Petty's is a home run! First, they are all original tunes. How many times do I have to hear another cover of Rock Me Baby? Second, there is so much enthusiasm and love for the music you just can't help but love it. And the band absolutely nails it. No, this isn't Damn the Torpedoes. It's something else, and it's great.<br /><br />When I think about buying a CD, I go to the Amazon reviews and head straight for the one-stars. I have to say, the one-star reviews for this release are extremely amusing. The level of immature name-calling and insults is something to read. But I can see how some Petty fans, who have Full Moon Fever and Into The Great Wide Open on constant rotation, might look askew at this and wonder WTF. Especially those not grounded in the blues. Just relax, Petty fans. Tom is having his Dylan moment, playing music he and the Heartbreakers like and hoping you might like it too (if you truly believe in them and their body of work). So you don't like it. I doubt this signals an overhaul of the Heartbreaker's sound. Just a nice diversion. Listen and enjoy.<br /><br />As a student of the blues, I enjoy this immensely. So much so that this is the first ever Petty or Heartbreakers CD I've purchased (although I've owned vinyl - see above). So glad I did too. Hope you will too.f the blues, I enjoy this immensely.

B001GCUO5M|4.0|After watching the trailer for this movie I was very excited to see this movie. After watching the movie I was not disappointed at all. It was a very entertaining movie, well worth the 2+ hours.<br />  This movie is about 2 US marshals, Edward and Chuck, who get sent to Shutter Island, a mental facility for the worst criminally insane patients, to investigate the mysterious disappearance of a female patient.  Also Edward is trying to find a patient who supposedly set his house on fire and killed his wife!<br />  Overall, if I could give this movie 4.5 stars I would, but since it's not quite a five star movie I'm going to have to give it a 4 star rating. If your looking for a scary thriller to watch with your partner or by yourself at night, this is definitely your movie!

She has moments of this in this here book.  She is at her best when she is talking about<br />the people she knows well (her husband and family).  She is at her worst when she dips casually<br />into people's lives or when she discusses ideas.  Unfortunately there is a lot of the latter in this<br />book.

B003O85W3A|5.0|I LOVE the new Arcade Fire CD \\"The Suburbs\\".     It might not have some of the innocent charm of the first two albums, but it is so good and so perfectly executed that it will have broad-ranging appeal and will make them into something even bigger than they already are.     When I hear this album, the word 'GRAND' comes to mind.  I hear good, full, orchestrated song arrangements that soar and glide; melodic, accessible rock/pop songs that draw me in; and thoughtful lyrics which stir feelings.     Win Butler is a very good songwriter, and in this presentation his voice should be less of an acquired taste for many listeners. Less warble, but no less emotional wail.  Joy, sorrow, exhilaration... this album has it all.  Like their first albums this one is a also a tempest in a teapot, just with a more streamlined sound this time.    If they sound more mainstream or more produced than on \\"Funeral\\" and \\"Neon Bible\\", that is fine with me.  I am not concerned if they are broadening their appeal, because I believe more people should hear this music and get in on just how wonderful the Arcade Fire is.    \\"The Suburbs\\" will come to be thought of by many as a rock and roll classic.  It will be considered one of the best albums of 2010.  And not just because I say so!  Hear it, and you will know this is true.     So just go buy it right now!  It's worth every penny.
B002ECEHZQ|1.0|I'm all for free speech.. but this is disturbing because (judging by the reviews) people have taken it seriously. The book encourages a violent and creepy method of forced love. How are your children supposed to learn respect for others when this sadistic method of punishment (yes, it is punishment) is used in the home. It is a form of torture as far as I am concerned, breaking the child's will to fight and violating their right to.. i don't know.. not be smothered? It is an potentially abusive and pseudoscientific method that has resulted in tragic outcomes for children, including at least six documented child fatalities.
B000YPUFA6|2.0|In Resident Evil: Extinction, the zombie-creating T-Virus has infected most of the planet, transforming it into a barren wasteland inhabited by the walking dead. Okay, we're already running into problems here. No virus, however mutagenic it may be, can alter the world's topography and weather patterns. Sure, now that the sole desire of 99.99999% of the people on earth is to devour flesh and sinew, there's no one around to keep greenery down or water dams functional, so there's bound to be decay within the structures of civilization. But there's no way a zombie virus can turn the entire continental United States into an arrid desert! So already, we're at an implausible start to this movie.    Our superpowered heroine, Alice, wanders this wasteland, trying to regain control of the abilities the evil Umbrella Corporation has imbued her with that are now going on the fritz.  She comes across a convoy of survivors led by Claire Redfield (Ali Larter of the television series Heroes), yet another protagonist from the video games these films are allegedly based on. Carlos Oliviera (Oded Fehr) and walking stereotype LJ (Mike Epps) are also among the convoy's members, and there's an uneasy reunion between them and Alice since she had abandoned them to protect them from her flaky powers. Believing that frigid Alaska is the only place on the planet untouched by the T-Virus (but if the T-Virus can illogically affect land masses and weather, what is the likelihood that cold climates can keep the virus at bay?), our little band of Road Warriors is heading north and would love to have Alice come along to help them get there.     As Shakespeare said \\"Aye, there's the rub\\" (and this is probably the only moment you will ever find someone make an association with this franchise and anything Bard-related). We now know why the T-Virus can turn North America into a desert - to simply serve the filmmakers' desire to rip off yet another superior genre movie. If the first Resident Evil was ashameless ripoff of The Matrix and Resident Evil: Apocalypse was a shameless ripoff of Escape from New York, then Resident Evil: Extinction is a shameless ripoff of The Road Warrior. Now it makes sense!    Meanwhile in another plotline that yet again shamelessly steals from another film (this time, Romero's Day of the Dead), the remnants of Umbrella's U.S. branch seek to make the zombies smarter, and they succeed to an extent. Their zombie specimens can now run, but have become even more vicious and brutal. I guess with the \\"slow zombie vs. fast zombie\\" debate still raging among the geek masses and fast zombies appearing in the form of the \\"Crimson Heads\\" in the remade Resident Evil game, the filmmakers were feeling the pressure to include running zombies in their film.     Umbrella also seeks to clone Alice. If they can't control the supersoldier they created, then why not make a reasonable facsimile, right? And boy howdy, do they pump them out, putting each clone through a rigorous obstacle course based on Alice's trials and tribulations as seen in the previous films. Even the mirrored hallway with the many body-slicing lasers makes a return, so they've clearly ran out of ideas to steal from other films and have just decided to reuse gimmicks from the earlier films which they had already stolen from other films. Why, it's like looking into a mirrored hallway! I doubt the filmmakers even see the symbolism there.     So Alice and our wannebe Mad Maxes head for the Great White North, encountering Umbrella's cadre of zombified Usain Bolts in the sandy ruins of Las Vegas. But like just about everything Umbrella does, the Speedy Gon-zombies fail and the convoy heads for Alaska, but not before Alice can break away from them to settle her vendetta with Umbrella once and for all. Or not, since a fourth, 3D-ified Resident Evil film is only a month away from wide release as of the writing of this review.    Resident Evil: Extinction is an improvement over the frame-droppingpiece of molasses that was Resident Evil: Apocalypse, but that really isn't saying much. I guess director Russell Mulcahy of Highlander fame can be credited for preventing this film from being another complete disaster, but the absurd scriptwriting by Paul WS Anderson doesn't make it easy on Mulcahy. As a huge fan of the video games, this film was another monumental disappointment, as the franchise and its helmers still seems unconcerned with making frightening, atmospheric zombie films and choose to fall back on more bankable formula of insanely big guns and Milla Jovovich's action figure status and baffling sex appeal (personally, I think she looks too tomboyish, lacking more feminine curvatures).    The gamers and fans of good films in general are begging: REBOOT THIS FRANCHISE ALREADY!
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a good DVD, but I prefer her Cardio and No More Trouble Zones DVDs to this one. I think it's because each workout is only 22 minutes long and I prefer a good 30 min + workout. A good introduction DVD to Jillian's other workouts!
B001GEL1NO|1.0|I have loved Soundgarden since I first heard Outshined on the radio, I have loved and followed everything Chris Cornell has done since then - I have like some stuff more than others - but I have never hated anything he has been involved with - until Scream.<br /><br />I saw him at a small venue on his promotional tour for this album and he played with a good rock band backing him - it was one of the best concerts I have ever been to.  So, he hasn't lost all sense, it just wasn't present on this album.<br /><br />The only song that didn't make me want to puncture my eardrums was the little outro song played at the end of the disc.<br /><br />The production takes the best voice in rock since Freddy Mercury and turns it into bad pop crap.<br /><br />Don't buy this.  Please.  Buy anything else he's done, it's all a million times better.
B003M5AXN4|4.0|It's a rather hokey movie but still manages to make you care about the characters and the final race (I'd give the movie alone 3 stars). The BD copy is crazy sharp and the colors of speed racer really stick out on the BD (video 5 stars). The sound was good but not exceptional and I agree with others that there should have been a lossless audio option (sound 3.5 stars). rounding it all together I give it an overall 4 star rating. For $10 it's a good addition to any BD collection to get a very unique picture and overall good BD experience.
B003O85W3A|5.0|Ok, I realize the year is a long way from over, but I can't imagine any albums are going to be better then this one. A word of warning though, this album is the very definition of a \\"grower.\\" It took me at least 7 spins before I started to really like it, but in my opinion at least that is always the sign of a really good album.     My favorite songs (so far) are the Suburbs, Suburban War, Used to Wait, and the awesome Sprawl 2, which sounds like an 80's song.     So is this album better then Funeral? That is hard to say. I love funeral because so many of the songs are so athemic and really get the blood boiling. These songs aren't as anthem oriented and sneak up on you a little more. I think for that reason the album might initially dissapoint fans of songs such as \\"Intervention\\" (from Neon Bible) or many of the songs on Funeral such as \\"Wake Up\\" or \\"Neighborhood 1.\\"     My only big complaint is that the album is two to three songs too long. This is somewhat ironic as the two albums I was most eagerly looking forwward to this year were this album and Congratultions by MGMT. I feel that Congratulations is too short and that The Suburbs is too long. There aren't really any bad songs, but I think if they had eliminated two to three songs (Wasted Hours, Deep Blue, Spraw 1) then this album would have benefited as there wouldn't have been any loss of momentum.    But this album is so good that it still deserves 5 stars. I know a lot of people have talked about Arcade Fire being the next supergroup alongside Coldplay or U2, but I'm not sure this is the album that will push them to that level just because there aren't any obvious singles that are going to appeal to the masses. In that regard Arcade Fire remain very much an indie band. But regardless of the label, they are one of the best bands out there and the Suburbs continues their evolution as a great band

B000006Z8E|5.0|I still remember discovering this LP back in '72, along with their first album, while riding the heady progressive wave to its peak, arguably only a year later. I wore out the first Darwin! LP and and still have the second. What a lump-in-the-throat moment it was 18 years later when I saw them play \\"La Conquista Della Posizione\\" at the La Mirada Civic Theater (thank you again, Greg Walker!).    But let's get on track here. Anyone who considers themselves a progressive fan must have this CD in their collection. If you're new to prog and enjoy both intricate and melodic music this is a must-have. Getting into describing the individual songs is futile unless you know the Italian prog sound, and if you don't already own this pivotal CD you don't yet know the Italian prog sound. In a nutshell, this album is more dynamic than their first, but, being a concept album, it has a continuity of sound. There are creepy moments with a what sounds like a creaking swing and synthesizers are weaving in-and-out, then Francesco comes in singing sweetly in the foreground and a clavichord plays with melodic economy. There's the epic build up during \\"La Conquista\\" which leads you straight into what sounds like the best James Bond film you've ever, ah, heard. But it's not like a John Barry score, it's Italian. It's not spaghetti western's Ennio Morricone either, it's prog. And you really just have to buy this CD to know what that means.
0380977788|5.0|Coraline by Neil Gaiman is a great book, which can be enjoyed by children and adults, however, I would only recommend it to kids who aren't too easily scared.    It begins with Coraline moving to a new apartment.  She quickly grows bored with her new home, and soon discovers a door which leads to an alternate version of her own apartment.  Her mother and father are there, as well as her other neighbors, however everything is more strange and fascinating then back in her old apartment.  Huge theatres with dogs as the spectators, wonderful food, and a talking cat are just a few of the wonders she finds.  However, everyone on the other side of the door has buttons where their eyes should be, and not all is as it first appears.    Neil Gaiman's writing style is short and to the point, making it easy to read for younger ages, and giving the prose a certain freshness and simplicity.  He is vague where he needs to be allowing the reader's imagination to take hold, and manages to convey a wealth of ideas in a very few words.  The story moves quickly, and never drags on.      The characters are also well done, not because any of them are particularly complex or has an extremely unique personality, but because they resemble real people.  The other apartment dwellers are almost caricatures of people, but remain just within the realm of believability, except for perhaps the Crazy Old Man Upstairs but then again I don't know anyone who claims to own a mouse band (which is exactly what it sounds like, complete with miniature instruments!).  The people on the other side of the door are quite creepy, and give off a good feeling of otherworldliness.    I won't spoil the plot, but it is fairly simplistic.  What makes Coraline such a joy to read is the world Gaiman creates.  The other world is scary and threatening, but also fantastical and amazing (at least at the beginning).  The story holds a real sense of menace and you really start to feel like you're the one exploring this new world.    Overall Coraline is a fun and creepy (sometimes scary) ride, which takes you on a trip to an alternate world, full of button-eyed people and thinly-veiled menace.  If your child is easily scared, then they probably shouldn't read Coraline, but that isn't to say no child should read it.  I think that most kids (as well as adults) would probably enjoy being scared by Coraline, and enjoy seeing those fears overcome.  I highly recommend Coraline to both children and adults.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|Our family really enjoyed this movie and hope that they will make more movies of the other Percy Jackson books.

B003L20ICE|3.0|... but everyone else is sort of a mess. Mom and Mom have as stable a relationship as any, which is to say there are plenty of rough spots to deal with, including plenty of affectionate friction with the teenaged kids. Not surprisingly, the fifteen year old boy, Laser, wants to know about the sperm donor who got him started. With help from his sister, legally of age to inquire about their shared but anonymous father, they find him. He turns out to be fun, exciting, and just enough of a \\"bad boy\\" to add some adventure to their lives.<br /><br />I've actually seen something similar happen: a teenager developed a desperate need to find a biological parent, found same, and enjoyed a brief honeymoon of good feelings between the long-lost whoevers. That fell apart in predictably short order, as does the reunion in this movie - but, in this script, lots more falls apart, too. Pretty much everything and everyone, in fact. You can't blame a fifteen year old boy for acting like a teenager, but the nominal grownups weren't functioning very much better. In a happy-enough ending, everyone ends up where they should except maybe Tanya, a lovely and loving lady playing the role of collateral damage.<br /><br />BTW, a phrasebook might help in understanding some of the movie's more confusing passages. Herewith, I offer some translations.<br />\\"Is there anything you want to tell us?\\" really means \\"There's a specific topic we want to discuss, and your life won't be worth living if you guess wrong.\\"<br />\\"You can talk about anything with us\\" really means \\"As long as it's not what's important to you.\\"<br />And of course, \\"We won't judge you\\" means, \\"but only if you guess not only the question we have in mind, but the answer we have in mind as well.\\"<br /><br />-- wiredweird, reviewing the theatrical release

9889979942|5.0|A few years ago I traveled throughout Kenya, Tanzania and Zanzibar extensively with a typical guidebook. It was helpful with finding hotels, restaraunts, tourist sites, etc., but it lacked info on the nuances between the different peoples in each region. Well, this is exactly what \\"China: Portrait of a People\\" has to offer. The candid photos really capture the essence of China's citizens in a very warm, inviting way. It's amazing to see how diverse this country is! I've been planning on going to China for some time now--my next big trip!--and some of the incredible photos in this book have really enticed me to visit certain areas I wouldn't have considered. If you're interested in learning about the different peoples of China, or if you're trying to decide where to go for a unique experience in China, this book is a must!
B000069CWE|5.0|Let me get one thing straight at the beginning. I have never been a fan of popular music at the time it was popular. My tastes usually lag about 5-10 years behind the rest of the world (except for some indie stuff), which is why I just got this record. Needless to say, I've never gotten into rap, hip-hop, or anything similar. I've always been a rock/alternative/classic rock kind of guy.<br /><br />I enjoy Linkin Park, because I like that it's a little offbeat, if you'll pardon the pun. Nobody is going to say that Mike Shinoda is one of the better rappers in the world, but the fact that he does what he does in a band that is otherwise metal makes him very interesting, and I have always been a sucker for the unique, regardless of genre. So when I found Reanimation, which is the same old Linkin Park but with more of an emphasis on the part that made them unique, I was instantly intrigued.<br /><br />Simply put, it's pretty damn good. The remixes are different enough from the originals to be thoroughly worth buying (especially from Marketplace), but they're still loyal to the originals enough to see the influence. \\"Frgt10,\\" the remix of \\"Forgotten,\\" is my personal favorite on the album for this reason - the chorus is very similar to the original, but the verses feature all-new raps by the guest artists, and the music has been utterly mangled into a bleak simplicity that mirrors the theme of the words. That's not to say that everything is overly artsy and deep; \\"Enth E Nd,\\" Kutmaster Kurt and Motion Man's remix of my favorite Park song, \\"In The End,\\" is one of a few that are still good for blasting out of the car on the highway.<br /><br />If you like Linkin Park at all, buy this CD. If you like good rock music but are looking for a change of pace, buy this CD. If you like rap, I can't tell you what to do, because I don't, but you should probably buy this CD.
B0019MQBJW|4.0|This is a main stream performance. Both sound and picture in this blu ray disc are very good. The group dancing is very enjoyable creating wonderful shapes. Regarding individual performances, there are better productions. Letitsu herself although a very skillful dancer, casts a very sad and unenjoyable mood. This production is the complete oposite of the Zurich production with Semionova where the production is not the standard one, the dances are different, the group dance are less enjoyable but the individual dances (and not only semionova) are much more interesting.
0061689246|3.0|I saw the movie Stardust and was interested in reading the book to hope for a better story because everyone always says books are better than movies.  And the book had some variations from the movie, but overall it was pretty similar.  Some parts were a tad slow though and honestly I didn't think the book was really better than the movie.  They were just different.  I still think the book was worth reading, and definitely so if you haven't seen the movie.
B0011U8NZ2|5.0|I went to this show and remember it as boring and was surprised to see it was released on cd.  As I recall Morrison stood at the microphone with little interest in performing.  I think he was performing his version of drunken jazz. The ambience of the venue was strickly big box. We went home disappointed.  Morrison seemed out of it.<br /><br />So i bought this cd only because i was there.<br /><br />It's excellent - but not your normal Doors show.  I noticed there is some editing from another show, but overall, if someone wants to listen to a doors record i put this one on.<br /><br />very highly recommended.<br /><br />bd
145360331X|4.0|Why did I give this timeless classic four stars?<br /><br />If you are into intense characters, driving plot, and descriptive narrative... this book is not for you. It lacks all of those things. The main characters of Jekyll and Hyde are scarcely developed, and the supporting characters are not developed at all. We are left with individuals who are little more than names and dialog. The plot is certainly there, and it is interesting, but it is hardly suspenseful. Save for the transformation from Jekyll to Hyde and vice versa, there isn't much description to go on to get a vivid picture of what's really happening.<br /><br />However, one cannot deny the philosophical, ethical, and theological implications of this short book. Perhaps character development and plot were deliberately glossed over so that the reader is forced to consider the duality of human nature. In Stevenson's story, there is no place for relative morality. There is no excuse for Hyde's actions, or Jekyll's for that matter. As Jekyll must come to grips with Hyde's wickedness, so too must we readers come to grips with the Hyde that lives in all of us.
B0008ENHUI|5.0|The product (DVD) was in excellent condition.  I received the DVD within a few days.  It's one of the best Steve McQueen movies I have ever seen.  It is a classic. I love this movie especially because it is based on a true story.
B003S897U0|5.0|Probably the best Crowes release ever. Ballad in Urgency/Wiser Time blows my mind, even though I've listened to and seen other variations. Just great from start to finish, with many, many wonderful moments. At last the new line-up shines like it should! Give a shout out for Luther! Morning Song is just so different.
B001ILFUDM|5.0|I always enjoyed Disney's version of Pinocchio, especially the music.  It never looked or sounded better than in this blu-ray version.
0307594777|4.0|Very well constructed plot, ambles along, constantly whetting your appetite. Expectations are slightly disappointed with the finish. However, a worthwhile summer's holiday read.
B002RAREAK|5.0|Love this cd. Mainly got it for the omg song but the whole thing blew me away. Sadly this is my only (first rather) cd owned by him but i can say with a big smile on my face this won't be the last. I'm sorry i got into this artist way too late!
1595825045|5.0|Seldom ever do I leave feedback for anything I purchase through amazon. I believe this product deserves some.    This is the first \\"art of the animated series/feature film\\" book I've ever bought. I'm not a designer, painter, nor digital artist. I bought it purely out of my love/appreciation for the show.    I was NOT dissapointed.    It's not only the beautiful and detailed images and series's conceptual designs that won me over. It's the texts by Michael Dante DiMartino and Bryan Konietzko -the show's creators- that complement the entire book that make it really unique.    Sometimes specific, sometimes broad, the annotations by DiMartino and Konietzko do take you through the creation process of Avatar. Their explanations on what worked and what didn't are enticing, plus, there are a few anecdotes here and there for the hardcore fan.    This is not a coffe table book. This is a book that belongs in the bookshelf of every fan of the show. And also future storytellers.
B00012BSHG|5.0|Only had the pool filled for a week, but so far so good.  Padded bottom is the biggest win, though a tiny bit tricky to maintain balance on for the young ones (under say 3).  Other pools we'd have to set up on grass which isn't great for the lawn and you're still standing/sitting on rocks, pine cones, etc.<br /><br />And our kids love the extra depth as compared to the much shallower pools.<br /><br />The thing we don't know yet is longevity.  Other inflatables we've bought don't last a season so I'll update this review in a month or two.
1572816112|3.0|Let me start off by saying I love artwork and the creativity of these cards. I fully appreciate the time and devotion that went into the design.  That being said, I don't understand why they produced them on such a poor quality card stock. These are NOT cards I would ever consider shuffling (they will easily crease). There does not seem to be a coating on these cards, making them matte and extremely difficult to slide over each other. The lack of a finish makes them susceptible to getting dirty very quickly. I have other cards (Rider-Waite, Arthurian Legend, Love Tarot) and they all have a glossy coating that protects the cards. Such beautiful cards and yet they can never be used without being ruined. A waste of incredible artwork.
B003K1EYM6|5.0|A must have for your iPad.  Allows import of pictures off your digital camera onto iPad when traveling.
B00110K62U|5.0|This DVD really does capture broadway and put it on your screen at home.  You see it in the beginning of the DVD with the opening song.  From beginning to end its non-stop great music.  Its got an all-star cast including some of the best of Les Mis.  Valjean (Colm Wilkinson)is so outstanding, his presence and his voice is just truly remarkable and has always made the character for me.  And of course Lea Salonga as Eponine just has the voice and the face that seems so lovely and elegant.      People who have not seen the play or know the story may have a hard time following what is going on in the DVD because it goes from song to song with nearly nothing in between.  Although they do show pictures on the big screen from the original play and also have a small side stage where a small amount of acting is done during songs, not to mention where the Baracade appears.  But there is a short synopsis of the main story in the DVD book.      For those who have seen the play and know whats going on, then this will just be memories upon memories and bring Les Mis right into your home.  I recommend this DVD for music lovers in general.  I haven't met anyone yet who can hate or be unimpressed with this music.
0060751967|5.0|I found this book by accident and have bought every book in the series.  I am waiting for the next book about Carlos.  The story about Roman and Shanna was very good for the first book in the series. Unfortunately I cannot say that about every book in the series, but this book had just the right amount of sex, the right amount of humor, and a new twist on an old subject. I was getting very tired of reading romance books with a sex story that dominated the entire book.  This book is a keeper.
0316067938|5.0|Out of the 4 books I love this one the most! I could not put the book down the first time I read it. It is packed full of wonderful surprises!
B003LYJUXU|2.0|Times Flies is a singles collection and depending on what cd version you get will also include the official music videos as well. I have all of Oasis's cds but thought it would be nice to have all of their singles and music videos in one place.    The biggest problem with this set is the lack of completion. One of Oasis's best songs \\"Rock n Roll Star\\" is not included, nor the last big radio hit in the US \\"Don't Go Away\\" or \\"Morning Glory\\". Another bad move was to put \\"Sunday Morning Call\\" as a hidden track...     The last grip and was done intentionally is not to have the singles in chrono order. If i knew this before hand I would have not gotten this and would have waited for another set to come out..
B001VLBDD0|4.0|This is a pretty good sequel to the original, but I have to say I didn't enjoy it as much. T1 just felt more intense when I watched it. I'm not saying you're going to feel that way, because most people I know prefer this one. Anyway, I still really enjoyed this movie.

0470601787|5.0|After reading BACK OF THE NAPKIN (Dan Roam)and his sequel, I pre-ordered VISUAL MEETINGS, thinking it would be a good sequel to the sequel.  The day the book arrived I had been a victim of another full-afternoon PowerPoint presentation barrage without much interaction.  What fresh thinking I found inside, moving from rank basics of flip chart posters and lists to the post-graduate \\"graphic skills continuum\\" in Chapter 21. It's really a nice how-to reference that will live close at hand;  I'll refer to it before every meeting that I lead, knowing that group interaction will be better and that my own skills and confidence will improve, starting with a blank sheet of paper rather than a PowerPoint with all the answers predetermined.      Don't miss the Group Graphics keyboard in Chapter 9, which is a great roadmap for practicing visual thinking skills and for selecting an approach to visual formats for different meeting purposes.  It's fascinating to see the experience of a long and successful career condensed into one powerful chart.
0143118420|1.0|One of the most self-centered, self-indulgent, self-important piece of drivel I've read in a long time.  Don't waste your money or time on this.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Nothing says \\"I heart Gilmore Girls\\" like a huge, padded plastic carrying case.  If you buy this collection, and every die-hard fan should, just know that you will be announcing your devotion to the world if you have nowhere to store the box.  While the set it somewhat larger-than-life (it probably won't fit on your standard DVD rack), it is paradoxically space-saving.  The inside is packed with every single disc in its season's slim folder.  The book that outlines the plot of each episode is the same as the \\"liner notes\\" in the traditional DVD boxes, but the format is much more enticing for a fan, as you can literally take out your book and recall the plot of the entire series.  Lastly, there is a book of \\"Gilmore-isms,\\" which demystifies many of the pop culture references that are made constantly on the show.  These are set up alphabetically, which I argue is not the best format for a person watching the series from disc 1 to disc 42; however, its encyclopaedic presentation results in a fun companion book.  If you could watch Lorelai and Rory's journey over and over again, do yourself a favor and buy this set.  You will be geeked out.      Now we just need the follow-up movie to be produced, yes?
B003ELOQCU|4.0|Item with fantastic presentation, but with useless blue-ray item and a 7\\" we are not able to listen.<br />Only a few people still remains with a pick up to listen vinyls.<br />On the other hand the meaning of the DVD is really nice and the box presentation is outstanding.<br />If you are a collector it is a nice investment if you are not it is also very good.
B0000CC5CS|3.0|This one is without a doubt the worst Terminator movie in the series. I didn't hate it, but it was only fun to watch the first time around. It's definitely the most violent, so if you're a total blood and gore fanatic you'll probably enjoy it more than I did. I love that kind of stuff, but it didn't seem to make me like it any better.
0385495323|4.0|I tremendously enjoyed reading this book, which explores perhaps the most fascinating aspect of cryptology: its role in society. From Queen Mary who was executed because her cypher was vulnerable to previously unheard-of frequency analysis, continuing with the war-altering influence of Enigma code breakers, to the advent of public-key cryptology in use today, the author paints a rich picture of historical events, personalities, and government interests.<br /><br />Mr. Singh's account of the people behind the cypher breakthroughs was the most valuable to me. For example, while I had heard of the formidable Alan Turing, my CS education neglected to include the sad bit that he had committed suicide, on account of his being homosexual- a sin at the time. There are more gems of information like this to be found, making this book interesting to a wide array of people, from historians to conspirationalists.. For the latter group, the author for example offers the juicy bit that the British Empire actively spread the use of Enigmas, particularly after they had broken the code, lulling countries and colonies into a false sense of security.<br /><br />I also liked the nod towards archeologists, a welcome relief from the otherwise politically and militarily motivated encryption landscape. I learned more about Knossos in Crete from this book than when I went there in person!<br /><br />Here's the best part: the text is easily understandable. Even for someone very rusty in his/her high school math, it is accessible as the author assumes practically nothing and even defines concepts such as prime numbers and modulus arithmetic. The precise example of an RSA code exchange is relegated to the appendix, meanwhile the author found an analogy involving buckets of paint. Brilliant.<br /><br />If I have to find one flaw with Singh's work, it is the age of the publication. 11 years spell \\"ancient\\" in the computer world and it's nothing short of bizarre to read that \\"the Internet is in its infancy\\" when I can access my bank accounts on a remote island - on my cell phone. An update of the last two chapters would do this otherwise priceless book good.y bank accounts on a remote island - on my cell phone.

B003KUSUG8|5.0|I have always been a fan, but he has outdone himself with Recovery. I know some people can't get past all the language but he is a poet and one of the finest ones living today. Just an amazing album from top to bottom.
B0006419J6|4.0|All in all, the movie is a good action flick. It has no slow spots; it keeps moving. Though a bit over the top at times, it is entertaining.<br />Will Smith adds greatly to the movie with his subtle facial expressions & sarcastic humor. With another lead actor, the movie would have suffered. The good doctor makes for his perfect foil
B002N5N5M0|5.0|Dexter has become quite the socailly-estabished killer. He now has a wife, Rita, two kids that came with her, and another kid that he and Rita had together. So, Daddy Dexter, Dark Passeger and all, are out there doing their thing. The problem is that Dexter becomes somewhat disturbed by the thing he is, knowing that monsters sometimes emerge from the closets they hide in. Poit in cae, Trinity, the killer he is hunting with the help of Deb and Frank Lundy (see the Bay Harbor Butcher, Season 2). As far as they know, Trinity has a pattern of threes that he does for a reason that reveals itself, and Dexter thinks he may have more in common with Trinity than he first thought. This way of thinking leave Dexter off his game, however, and leads to an ending that almost all shows EVER have yet to top.<br /><br />As far as Dexter, Season 4, i was afraid of it initially. The daddy theme and the marriage theme are oftentimes poison for shows and I thought it was going to be this way again. Boy was I surprised. Early on the show pointed out that Dexter was one smart cookie (take a look at the gym episode) and he was a loving father with a need for an air conditioning unit. This portrayal of Dexter, this great thing they have done, really made me like him quite a bit here. Even more to the credit of the show was the antithesis of Dexter - one John Lithgow AKA Trinity. Trinity is a puzzle you want to solve and, for a time, you think you have him pegged. Then you see more of him and, well, this thing jumps out and startles you severely. Personally I loved that point and i loved that ending, mostly because it shocked me and it caught me off-guard.<br />Fans of the show will wbe stunned by this.<br /><br />A fan that has gonet this fan should check out this seasons. It will do them a service, a great one, and make them happy campers. If you missed something you will want to catch it first, however, making certain that you know everything that has taken place. Daddy Dexter really has something happen that is a shocker and, well, you need to see it. If you miss if you will be a sad, sad spectator wondering why - ooo why?<br />I love the show - its been a 5 star series up to now - but this takes it up a level.

B001GCUER0|5.0|I love this show.  I'm not a big drama fan, but the whole era just fascinates me;  the costumes, the cars, the constant smoking and drinking, and especially the interaction between the women and men, according to their gender roles in the 1960's.  And the men look really good in suits so I can't complain.  ;)
B000Y179KO|5.0|I want to rave about the Eagles album LONG ROAD OUT OF EDEN. In fact, I want to thank Glenn, Don, Joe, and Timothy B. for this spectacular work. Guys, I know that sometimes you don't get along, or so the celeb rumors go, but when it counts, you gather together and create great music. I think this one is on a par with HOTEL CALIFORNIA.<br /><br />You don't have to be an Eagles fan to like this album. Let me tell you why I think the music and the lyrics make it great. I'm no music critic, but this is how I see it as someone who listens to a LOT of music of every variety.<br /><br />The strength of the music is in the layering of instrumentation, the melody, the counter melody, and the foot-tapping beat.<br /><br />The lyrics? The specific words chosen, the ideas they represent, the internal rhythm, the poetic meter, the expressed emotion, the emotional response evoked in the listener.<br /><br />The arrangements? Eagles to the max. The same elements that make HOTEL CALIFORNIA songs recognizable as an Eagles product are present in these songs too. I'm so glad they know what their strengths are and haven't tried to \\"modernize\\" or suddenly incorporate hip hop as certain others have. I'm glad they realize their style or \\"sound\\" is as good today as it was when they first joined forces.<br /><br />Put all that together, and you get songs that make you think as you're listening and think about their ideas even when the song isn't playing.<br /><br />Another thing you get? Singable songs. These are the kinds of songs that you can sing, and that is a rarity in today's music world. Oh, they're also songs you can dance too. That's important, at least to me.<br /><br />EDEN is so good that I'm hard pressed to pick one or two favorite songs. But I'll try.<br /><br />How Long - nice rocking song -- love the line, \\"How long, how long, woman will you weep? Rock yourself to sleep.\\" Also love, \\"wish I lived in the land of fools and no one knew my name.\\" (Sometimes I think I do live in the land of fools.)<br /><br />Busy Being Fabulous - \\"You were just too busy being fabulous, too busy to think about us.\\" This song makes me think of too many men and women I know who got enthralled by the whole fame/power/money thing. They didn't have time for their children's school activities, for their kids' problems and needs. I guess they just didn't have time for kids period. Hard to think about PTA meetings, Little League, or Sunday school class in the climb up the corporate ladder or the rush to write a bigger book for a bigger contract. Now these people who \\"made it\\" can't understand why their kids are such problems or why their kids are too busy to visit during the holidays. Too many self-absorbed people bewildered by their adult children's indifference.<br /><br />What Do I Do With My Heart - Oh! The ultimate breakup song question. Its lyrics say what we've all wondered at some point in our lives.<br /><br />Fast Company - Everyone wishes their kids heeded them when they warned of this.<br /><br />Do Something - Utterly love it and the meaning behind it!<br /><br />Long Road Out of Eden was worth waiting for.busy being fabulous, too busy to think about us.\\" This song makes me think of too many men and women I know who got enthralled by the whole fame/power/money thing.

1846553482|5.0|Nothing like curling up with a good serial killer.  But that is exactly what you should do.  Go on, get good and comfy, turn off the phone, gather up your favorite munchies and prepare for a pounding long session with Jo Nesbo's Harry Hold and his neighborhood of friends and thugs.  The fifth (English publication) in a series from master Norwegian yarn spinner, Nesbo maintains Detective Hole's premier position as the best of the hard driven cops in print.  Not your typical boiler plate fare, this series stays taut and original from opening to close.  Nesbo's books are extremely atmospheric with the Norwegian weather becoming a tactile character on its own.  Likable or not depending on their personal take on life, the human characters are distinctive thinking forms of flesh and blood. Colors are every shade of gray in your imagination.  There's just something about the way Nesbo weaves his tale and creates Hold's world that make his books unforgettable and not-put-downable.

630469654X|5.0|This past weekend I watched Ladyhawke, a 1985 flick, again. I was drawn into the fantasy world of Etienne Navarre and Isabeau d'Anjou, two lovers cursed by the Cardinal whose love Isabeau had scorned. The only drawback to this wonderful film is the soundtrack. I'd love to see them re-score this film. I'd be in line to get a copy of it.<br /><br />This emotion-drenched story is so compelling, so well-acted by the young and beautiful Rutger Hauer as Navarre and Michelle Pfeiffer as Isabeau, but the soundtrack is so jarring and inappropriate for a love story that sweeps you away to medieval times. You don't just suspend disbelief at the fantasy story so much as you fling it into oblivion. The desperation and despair of the two ill-fated lovers is wrenchingly believable.<br /><br />Directed by Richard Donner, 7 years after he did the original Superman movie and 2 years before he directed the first Lethal Weapon film, the set of Ladyhawk was where Donner met Lauren Shuler who produced Ladyhawke. The couple subsequently married and remain married today. They were both honored with a double star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in October 2008. he shows why he's such an amazing director. The film was nominated for two Academy Awards and for several science fiction awards.<br /><br />Edward Khmara wrote the story and the screenplay. (Writers, you can learn from Mr. Khmara's screenplay because it works on so many levels.) The Warner Brothers marketing department said the movie was based on a true medieval legend. Of course, Mr. Khmara, who created the story from his writer's imagination, took issue with that claim. He took his complaint to the Writers Guild Association and was awarded a cash settlement from Warners. However, the medieval legend claim had a life of its own by then.<br /><br />Because of Ladyhawke, I decided to forgive Mr. Khmara for his other 1985 work, the horrendous Enemy Mine starring Dennis Quaid and Lou Gossett as a pregnant male alien. Mr. Khmara went on to write Dragon, The Bruce Lee Story, 1993, another of my favorite movies.<br /><br />Ladyhawke has the tagline: Cursed for eternity. No force in Heaven will release them. No power on Earth can save them. The movie starred Matthew Broderick, fresh from his War Games star turn, as Philipe Gastone, a thief who escapes from the dungeon at Aquila. He's nearly captured, but Captain Navarre rescues and befriends him. Navarre has been hunted by the evil Bishop's men for two years, ever since he escaped with Isabeau, the object of the Bishop's lust. Since the Bishop couldn't have Isabeau, he cursed her and Navarre. By night, Navarre is a wolf; by day Isabeau is a hawk. They are always together, yet always separated. Navarre wants Philipe help him re-enter the city so he can kill the Bishop.<br /><br />Broderick's character is am amusing distraction, but the real acting heavy hitters are Hauer and Pfeiffer. Rutger Hauer is so completely believable as the tortured knight in love with a woman he can only see when he's in the shape shifting form of a wolf. Pfeiffer is electric as the Isabeau who loves her knight. Wolves and hawks mate for life, just as these two cursed lovers.<br /><br />Hauer's role was three years after his mortality-conscious android in Blade Runner, another favorite of mine. Michelle Pfeiffer played Isabeau after paying her dues through years of television performances and 3 previous movies: Grease 2, Into The Night, and the infamous Scarface. John Wood, also in War Games with Broderick, was the evil Bishop of Aquila. He's so good that you instantly hate him. Leo McKern, the late Australian actor who some always thought was English, played Father Imperius the Monk. He set the whole story in motion by betraying a confession to the Bishop who then cursed the lovers. Naturally, he's the one who knows how to break the curse.<br /><br />Some movies transcend their flaws. The epic love story Ladyhawke is such a movie, and it possesses the power to win a new generation of viewers.
B000067CPX|5.0|I have a very strong opinion of this album, and that opinion is that this album is a masterpiece. Just the right mix of grit, shine, and musicality. The touches of electronica, the beautifully lush and layered harmonies, with the know how to put it off. When this was released in 2002, it was instantly obvious that it was something very special. I love everything Pepper's, give me 'Sir Psycho Sexy' any day of the week, but this? This? Pure sonic soul food. One of the absolute best.
B003X27L9U|1.0|***WARNING: The following is a literary review and is not meant to discourage you from reading the novel. There are spoiler alerts below for those who think their reading experience might suffer with prior knowledge of the book.***    If I've been silent for a day, it's because I've been reading Room by Emma Donoghue, a novel about growing up as a child of a kidnapped young woman in a hermetically-sealed 11-by-11-foot room.    What got me interested in the book was the case of Elizabeth Fritzl, who had been kept for 24 years as a sex-slave in a dungeon in Austria by her father, emerging as a 42-year-old woman with seven children by him, one of whom died of illness after his gross neglect -- thereafter to be incinerated by him in a heating stove next to the dungeon.    I read and watched every bit of news about the Fritzls almost since the day it burst out in April of 2008 and am still on the lookout for whatever little piece of information I could get about the monster Josef Fritzl or his hapless though rescued daughter Elizabeth and six surviving children/grandchildren.    The book was touted at the conclusion of the Fritzl case as an offshoot of it.    Knowing all the juicy details about the Fritzl case, I got not a little disappointed with the novel. The beginning, and actually the whole perspective of the latter, is novel: it is told from the point of view of the child, who was born in the room and was taught by his mother, at five, how to escape from it and rescue her. ***SPOILER ALERT*** He emerges as the novel's unknowing, unwilling and ever-unconscious hero -- superhero, in fact -- even leading her to her own closure by insisting on visiting the room for the last time. ***    It's a cute way of presenting a highly distressing, intriguing and gripping situation. ***SPOILER ALERT*** He manages to escape from his captor, not having known anything about the outside world except what he had seen on TV in his five years in it, tell the police about his mother, andlead them, through a particularly alert and motherly police officer, to his mother, who has stayed in the Room waiting for the rescue.***    The plot is well-done, gluing the reader to the novel up to the last sigh of relief, after all the goodbyes are done to every aspect of the tiny Room.    But presenting a situation from the eyes of a five-year-old child, no matter how proficiently, has its limitations.    The characters of the two other protagonists in the novel turn out flat in consequence. Old Nick, the kidnapper, who has kept Ma, Jack's mother, in the prison-room for seven years, cannot be elucidated. Of course, he is more like the kidnapper of Natasha Kampusch than Josef Fritzl, the other Austrian sex-slaver whom we never get to know because he killed himself upon his victim's escape. So perhaps we can forgive the lack of a rounded picture of Old Nick, though he for his part ends up in prison.    But Ma's sudden suicide attempt becomes as much of a conundrum to us as it is to Jack. It could very well happen in real life -- a 26-year-old mother who has brought up her son very well, teaching him not only to read and write but to do very good math as well as providing him with all the physical and vocal exercises she could within the limits of a hidden prison, could very well, after being rescued by him through her own plan, want to kill herself because of a bruising encounter with thoughtless media.     But then, taking into account her son's own narrative, it would seem that she almost deliberately planned the whole scenario for five years, waiting for the opportune moment for him to grow up. Why would she suddenly throw away all her efforts -- and her son's future -- just because of some media meddling?    It could be explained, of course -- as a sudden weakness in character built in even before her kidnapping -- but perhaps not from a little boy's viewpoint.    So what starts out as a cute device doesn't end up cute at all.    And we who know the Fritzl case begin to associate the novel with the true story.    In the true story, Felix, the youngest boy, is also five, and experiences the outside world in much the same way, with the same fascination and wonderment, and the same physical disabilities, described with just much more detail in the novel.    But in the true story, Elizabeth, the mother and incest victim, is heroic all the way. She is not known to have tried to kill herself after rescuing all her children from the clutches of her ogre of a father. And in the true story, we get a rather deep glimpse into the twisted psyche of Josef Fritzl besides.    What is the true story about, why is it so riveting?    It is able, in its most complicated true-to-life fashion, to portray the depths to which the human soul can descend, as well as the heights of hope and faith to which it can aspire.    Room cannot do that, not only because of the viewpoint it has chosen, but because the author herself, by all accounts [...], lacks the perspicacity and depth to see these dimensions.    So Room becomes exactly what she intended it to be -- a novel about child development, unfortunately comparable to the Fritzl and, to a minor extent, Kampusch stories because of the many elements she borrowed from both -- without acknowledging it, by the way, in her final book.    Which is a shame. Reading Room is like reading the novels of Paolo Coelho, which I could not for the life of me appreciate. Both make for extremely popular (because, I suspect, easy) reading. Both try but fail to make some meaningful literarily profound statement about life (though Coelho tries harder and literally does, in essay fashion -- in fact he's quoted rather widely on it).     And both will not, I am afraid, outlast this century.    So now let me go back to my Dostoevsky, which I've been trying to re-read without much success on my iPhone -- the same device I used to read, with ease, both Room and Coelho.

The following may be one of the finest passages I've ever read: \\"When I return to this world, I will be a man. I will walk among you. I will lick my lips with my small, dexterous tongue. I will shake hands with other men, grasping firmly with my opposable thumbs. And I will teach people all that I know. And when I see a man or a woman or a child in trouble, I will extend my hand, both metaphorically and physically. I will offer my hand. To him. To her. To you. To the world. I will be a good citizen, a good partner in the endeavor of life that we all share.\\" I pray that more people will be inspired to live such a noble life.
B002RSDW80|5.0|Julie & Julia is another triumph for the remarkable Meryl Streep and the equally remarkable Stanley Tucci. Amy Adams rises to the occasion as Julie Powell, the little blogger who could.<br /><br />In case you don't know the story, Julie Powell was a frustrated writer married to a magazine editor and enslaved to a government job that was sucking the life out of her. She hears about a friend who is blogging and vows that she could do that too, but she doesn't know what she could blog about. The only thing she really loves to do is cook.<br /><br />Why not a cooking blog? She decides to cook and blog her way through Julia Child's amazing Mastering The Art of French Cooking. Her husband, played by Chris Messina, is suitably supporting. In fact, he puts up with more than a bit of her whining until she has her wake-up moment, realizes what a bitch she's been, and cleans up her act.<br /><br />Along the way we're treated to Meryl Streep as Julia Child, fifty years ago embarking on her own voyage of discovery in post-war France with her husband Paul, played by one of my favorite actors Stanley Tucci. Why Mr. Tucci hasn't won an Oscar yet is a mystery to me. I've loved him from the time I saw him as Muerte in Undercover Blues with Mr. Dazzling Smile aka Dennis Quaid.<br /><br />We switch back and forth between Julia, trying to find herself in the cooking world dominated by men to Julie, trying to find herself period. Despite certain negatives, for instance, Julie simply isn't on equal standing when it comes to Julia Child's vibrant personality. Yes, she's the heroine of her side of the tale, but she's not particularly likeable in many scenes. One wonders why she's friends with such disparate characters who she envies, despite their shallowness, However, perhaps the real Julie, in real life, was insecure and lost so the movie is a faithful rendering of her at that time in her life. Thankfully, her character grew in the movie. One can hope in real life also.<br /><br />All in all, the movie is an utter delight from its opening in a Paris that only exists in memory to its closing shot of Julia Child's kitchen, now in the Smithsonian Museum. In between, we get to see the profound love between Julia and Paul Child. We hope that Julie and her husband's relationship will be equally rich and enduring.<br /><br />Let's not forget the food. Oh, my! After watching the DVD a couple of times I had to break out my old copy of Julia's cookbook and roast a big fat hen. I'm happy to report the butter-crisped skin and moist flavorful chicken were superb, and the sauce was equally delicious!its opening in a Paris that only exists in memory to its closing shot of Julia Child's kitchen, now in the Smithsonian Museum.

B003HKN52A|1.0|Well, they've done it again! I waited for months for \\"Elvis On Tour\\" to be released on DVD, and now, just one day before the release date, I learn that it's been tampered with! Just add this to the long list of other Elvis products that they've done this with!!! I will NOT be purchasing this DVD because I am sick and tired of having to buy Elvis items 10 tens before they decide to just LEAVE THEM ALONE and release them in their ORIGINAL FORM!!! It's bad enough that TONS of unreleased material from this film exists and NONE of it has been added to the DVD as bonus material, but Warner had to also go ahead and ruin the original release as well!!! I've had it with these money-grubbing companies that PURPOSELY do this so that 20 years down the road, they can boast on the next version that \\"Johnny B.Goode\\" has been put back into the film...as if they are doing us a big favor!!! (check out the DVD releases of \\"Kissin'Cousins\\" and \\"Girl Happy\\"! That's exactly what they did with these, because for ten years we were stuck with the VHS tapes that had one song deleted from both films!!!) We Elvis fans have consistantly been short-changed by these greedy companies for years, and the list of inferior products that they've put out is much too long to even go into here! You can, however, check out some of my past reviews here, if you want to know what to look out for! All I can say is that I'm completely disgusted once again!!! This is one reason why I will NEVER pre-order an Elvis product from amazon (or anywhere else) because these alterations are never announced in advance, and if a fan is purchasing a certain item, they should be told EXACTLY what they are getting!!! I've already read a few reviews from fans that have pre-ordered this disc, and were sorry now that they did! This is NOT fair to the fans!!! As always, I learned about these changes from the Elvis websites, and NOT from any of the sites that are selling this item! As you can see, I only gave this product one star,and it doesn't even deserve that but it's the lowest rating amazon apparently allows you to give!!!
B002BWP4A6|5.0|Michael Hanekes' \\"The White Ribbon\\" is a welcome departure from the aimless nihilism of his recent work, like \\"Funny Games\\".  Make no mistake, the director is travelling in familiar territory: the atrocities of wayward, psychopathic youth, but here he is actually searching for reasons with a passionate intensity.  In much the same way that Ingmar Bergman struggled with God, Haneke is struggling with the shameful heritage of his own nation and attempting to understand why the youth of Germany became Adolf Hitler's willing henchmen.<br /><br />Set in a rural village of Pre-World War 1 Germany, the only consistent voice of reason and sanity we have is Christian Friedel, a young schoolteacher who also narrates the film as an older man (Ernst Jacobi).  Friedel plays the part elegantly, like a deer caught in the headlights of some artificial storm not created by nature but something even more senseless in it's wrath.  The Lutheran Pastor (Burghart Klaubner) who runs the village school fails as a vessel of God's grace: he is more intent on keeping things quiet and holding his children to ridiculously unrealistic standards than to recognize the horror of what is emerging from their private contempt of established values.  Ulrich Tukur plays a significantly different role than Dietrich Bonhoeffer (\\"Agent of Grace\\") or Henning Von Tresckow (\\"Operation Valkyrie\\"), starring as the monstrous Baron, the wealthiest man in the village to whom all else answer.  At the beginning of the movie he has quite a bad accident, falling victim to a trap set up by, in all probability, his own daughter.  He verbally abuses her so badly in one scene that he goes from being sympathetic to a monster in the space of a few seconds.  It is also revealed that he abuses his little girl sexually.  The Pastor subjects his children to excessive discipline, though in true Scorsese style, we are not physical witnesses to it: Haneke knows that the implication of the abuse is worse than actually showing it.<br />Though an array of horrendous things occur--we see the children becoming more and more hateful and sneaky, even going so far as to impale a wounded bird with a pair of scissors and leave it on the Pastor's desk--the most representative of what will come in the future is the secret attack on a handicapped child, one of the Baron's sons, which leaves him without sight.  He is meant to represent, in his impoverished and bandaged state, every concentration camp victim, every victim of euthanasia, every unknown man or woman who would later perish in Germany's embrace of madness.  Poverty is an issue as well, of course; the underclass struggle with the Baron's wealth, resenting it, one of the young men even going so far as to destroy the new season's cabbage patch.  The boy's father later hangs himself out of shame.  Nietzsche's \\"devaluation of all values\\" is happening quickly, but not reaping the benefits he imagined it might.  The Pastor will not allow any of this to come to light, and when the young schoolteacher finally acknowledges that the children have been doing it (perhaps with a little help, though the ambiguity hangs in the air) he tells him he has a sick mind and to shut his mouth under penalty of jail.<br /><br />And a good time was had by all!<br /><br />This is a visually flawless, masterful film.  If Haneke is trying to point the finger toward poverty, religion, or the dangers of leaving very energetic youth unattended he is one amongst many.  Sexual abuse, repression, horrendous financial conditions have existed in countries for decade after decade and nothing quite like the Third Reich developed.  They are factors but not an excuse.  Is he even offering answers or telling us to stop looking? There's no way to know, and in any case, neither approach suffices to explain the horror of the holocaust.  All that said, this is without doubt one of the best films of 2010 and a fantastic meditation on the mystery of evil.n array of horrendous things occur--we see the children becoming more and more hateful and sneaky, even going so far as to impale a wounded bird with a pair of scissors and leave it on the Pastor's desk--the most representative of what will come in the future is the secret attack on a handicapped child, one of the Baron's sons, which leaves him without sight.

What's this?  I can get an advance to pay for just that?  How convenient!  And when I come home, they'll hire Julia Roberts to play me?  How apropros.  How sickening, more like.

B001TODCII|5.0|If you're going to Europe, and you're young and relatively naive - which is a nice way of saying you're a dumb American who takes personal safety for granted, or if you are the parents of someone like that - do yourself a favor and watch Taken. It might keep you from making a worse than stupid mistake.<br /><br />No, I'm not a paranoid freak, but I have traveled a good part of this globe and seen things. A couple of summers ago, I spent some time in Italy. I was amazed at the blatant stupidity so many American kids under the age of 25, exhibit. I don't know if it's because they've seen a gazillion teen movies where the thing to do is go abroad and get laid or what. But I saw teen girls hanging out of their hotel room windows, accosting men passing beneath their window. They were looking for a good time with a cute Italian boy.<br /><br />So, is Taken an accurate portrait of what can happen to naive, unsuspecting young women? Well, let's just say it may not happen every day (I hope), but it happens. Unfortunately, when it happens, (SPOILER ALERT) I don't think the young women are ever rescued the way the girl is rescued in this film.<br /><br />This isn't just a non-stop action film, it has emotional depth, portrayed subtly, yet effectively, by Liam Neeson's craggy features. His daughter is his whole life. He's lost everything else, and he knows it. And he knows why. He's determined to solidify the bonds with his nearly-grown daughter. His devotion is shown in the way he carefully selects her birthday present. With careful attention to detail, he wraps the present himself. With every strip of tape he tears, he's pouring his love into the wrapping of a present that's modest compared to the expensive gifts given by his wife's wealthy husband. He hangs in there which is sometimes the hardest thing for a man to do when his wife and child have moved on. Most men write it off and move on also.<br /><br />Taken is an action thriller, but it's also the portrait of a man who will do whatever it takes to save his child. Though most of us don't have the Jack Bauer-skills, as possessed by the character in this film, that willingness to protect our children is something we all identify with. That's the universal truth that makes the film work, and that's why there's emotional resonance in Taken.<br /><br />The film is written by Luc Besson; known for the La Femme Nikita franchise, The Fifth Element, and The Transporter franchise; and Robert Mark Kamen; known for Taps, The Karate Kid franchise, Gladiator, and A Walk in the Clouds as well as The Fifth Element and The Transporter franchise. The two work in what I call the uncommon hero action thriller.<br /><br />All of Besson's heroes are men of adventure now doing prosaic jobs. In Fifth Element starring Bruce Willis, the hero was driving a cab. In Transporter, the hero, once a Ranger, was a driver who transported whatever. In Taken, the hero is a retired spy/black ops/whatever who's working security gigs. He uses his old skills to save his daughter who is being forced into the sex/slave trade.<br /><br />I suspect Kamen brings the emotional resonance to the partnership. His previous works are emotionally charged conflicts. In Taps, the hero is tortured by the demands of honor and obedience. In Karate Kid, the hero is young and untried and faced with standing up to bullies despite the consequences. In A Walk in the Clouds, the hero, played superbly by Keanu Reeves, is offering his protection to and falling in love with, a young woman, pregnant out of wedlock in the 1940's.<br /><br />Universal truth is the difference between a good flick and a great one that will be remembered.

B002VECLVO|4.0|3.5 stars. Throughout his career, Colin Firth has had to live down the persona of \\"Mr.Darcy\\" in \\"Pride & Prejudice\\", the role that made him a star and which it seems he was born to play. Now Mr. Firth gives life to a role on the opposite end of the spectrum from Mr. Darcy, and it's a testament to his acting talent that he seems equally born to have played it as well. His George Falconer, a 50-something English professor coping (poorly) with the death of his longtime partner in 1962 closeted Los Angeles wakes up one morning 8 months into his grief and decides that today is going to be different: Today he is going to end his life. As George goes about his last day, tidying up his earthly affairs, he encounters various people that show him that it might be possible, and worthwhile, to imagine a life beyond his grief. Firth is an actor of sublime subtlety who can capture myriad complex emotions in the space of one close-up. He is in every scene. First-time director Tom Ford has assembled a cast of wonderful British actors around Firth who are all playing American; unaccountably the only American in the cast with a major role, Julianne Moore, is playing British (badly). Her affected in-and-out attempt at 'posh' plus the completely immaterial device of setting George's last day during the Cuban missile crisis forces me to dock this half a star. The period is stunningly recreated, but this story might have been equally powerful, if not more so, by being contemporary. Yes, we've come a long way since 1962, but not so far that the grief George must keep hidden is completely foreign to our own era. Overall, a very impressive debut for Tom Ford. It remains to be seen if he will have a film career that can transcend the niche of gay cinema. As for Mr. Firth, here's hoping he will continue to explore all the facets he is capable of. Bravo.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I own both versions of the movie. In all honesty I prefer the original cut with the sequence of music in that version as opposed to the director's cut with the new sequence of music and the placement of songs that they could not afford to include in the initial release. That being said, the director's commentary assisted by Kevin Smith is pure gold and is the highlight of the DVD release. It reminds me of the comedic DVD commentary found on the Coen Bros movie, 'Blood Simple.'

B001KVZ6F2|5.0|Clint Eastwood is Walt Kowalski, not Dirty Harry even though the promo for the theatrical release makes you think it's going to be a guns-blazing Dirty Harry encore. His role is more like the tough gunny from Heartbreak Ridge who is now a senior citizen.<br /><br />Okay, guns and fisticuffs are involved, but the film is so much more than that. Joining Mr. Eastwood in the film is Christopher Carley as Father Janovich, a determined priest who knows little of real life as lived by Korean war vet Kowalski; Ahney Her, entrancing as Sue Lor, the spirited Hmong girl next door who just won't let Kowalski continue living isolated and alone; and Bee Vang as Thao Vang Lor, called Toad by Kowalski who becomes his surrogate father and role model, teaching the young Hmong how American blue collar guys bond and behave.<br /><br />As the film opens, Kowalksi is in church for the funeral of his wife, a woman he characterizes later as the best woman in the country that he managed to catch. You won't catch Kowalksi moving into assisted living though his stereotypical sons would love to sell the family home in the old neighborhood and put him where they could justifiably say, \\"He's being taken care of.\\" He's an embarrassment and an emotional anvil around their necks just as they are a puzzle to him.<br /><br />The trouble with the old neighborhood isn't that it's been taken over by Asians, but that the gangs - Asian, black, Hispanic - have a stranglehold on the decent people who are trying to find their piece of the American dream while still clinging to their traditions and values.<br /><br />Gran Torino isn't so much about knocking heads, defending the old neighborhood, and facing down gangbangers as it is about character growth and discovering that family doesn't necessarily mean the people you're related to by blood. Eastwood gives a layered performance that is worthy of Best Actor. In fact, there are several stellar performances in this film i.e. Carley's priest and unknown actors Ahney Her and Thao Vang Lor. Even Clint's son Scott Eastwood, credited in the film as Scott Reeves, is good in his role as the gutless Trey.<br /><br />The ending is surprising. And poignant. If you're an Eastwood fan, you'll love the film. If you abhor Eastwood, you'll be surprised how this film stays with you. I'm just surprised Eastwood didn't sweep all the major film awards. Awards don't make a film a classic. Make no mistake, Gran Torino will become a classic.en Clint's son Scott Eastwood, credited in the film as Scott Reeves, is good in his role as the gutless Trey.

B003S897U0|4.0|Two discs, 59, 61 minutes each approximately.  The sound is very crisp and punchy.  The separation between the vocals and instruments is very good.  This is one of the best sounding albums the group have ever released.  From the delicate sound of the mandolin, to deep bass notes-every instrument has its place.  The discs are slipped in, bare, inside a four-part, fold-out cardboard sleeve.  The graphics inside consist of a color drawing of trees in a forest, with a \\"stand-up\\"  feature of two crows-a nice touch.  There's no booklet for this release.  Song titles, band members, and recording information are on the holder itself.<br /><br />This set, with songs based largely on acoustic arrangements (some tracks have electric instruments), is full of the rhythm and swagger THE BLACK CROWES are known for.  If anyone thinks this is some kind of sleepy/hippie/laid back/ acoustic set-forget it.  This is prime BLACK CROWES doing what they do best.  Chris Robinson's vocals are center stage, and his time-worn voice carries these songs into another realm.  The band makes good use of acoustic guitars and a pumping, yet sympathetic rhythm section to create a foundation for Robinson's voice.  The use of electric guitars (and occasionally pedal steel, banjo, mandolin, and fiddle) in the mix add depth and emotion to the arrangements.  The piano is an essential part of a number of these tracks-echoing Robinson's plaintive vocals.<br /><br />A few highlights.  The opening track \\"Jealous Again\\", is a stomping, rolling rock 'n' roll song in the best tradition of the Crowes.  Chris Robinson's voice jumps out of the speakers almost immediately, and the female backing singers fit in seamlessly along with the acoustic and electric guitars.  \\"Share The Ride\\" sounds like a harder version of something Levon Helm might sing.  Third track \\"Remedy\\", is THE BLACK CROWES like long time listeners know them-straight ahead, bluesy rock 'n' roll.  The beautiful \\"Non-Fiction\\" is a combination of the bands harder stance vocally, yet the arrangement is full of delicate acoustic guitars.  This long track (almost 8 minutes) winds down beautifully to almost nothing-like watching smoke disappear in the air.  With \\"Hotel Illness\\", the band is once again back in full swaggering form.  The simple beat, the harmonica, the hand-claps, and all the guitars weave a dense sound for Robinson's voice and perfectly arranged electric guitar fills.  The long (over 9 minutes) atmospheric song \\"Wiser Time\\", shows how far the band has come from the \\"Shake Your Money Maker\\" era (which I like), with an arrangement that is subtle yet is musically intricate.<br /><br />The second disc starts off with the well known \\"She Talks To Angels\\", which with mandolin and pedal steel in the mix of guitars, gives this track an extra edge.  \\"Morning Song\\" begins with the sound of the band counting off and tentatively beginning to play the opening notes, which gives the feeling of being in the studio while this was recorded.  This is THE BLACK CROWES  in full gospel mode.  The bass and drums, the piano, the background vocals, all combine in an almost over-whelming fervor of gospel sound.  \\"Good Friday\\", with its plaintive vocal and harmonica, is one of the better ballads on the album.  Nothing fancy-its subtle arrangement is very emotive.  \\"Thorn In My Pride\\" is the sound of the band jamming on acoustic guitars, with Robinson's vocal backed up by female backing singers to good effect.  \\"Girl From A Pawnshop\\", with mandolin, fiddle, and acoustic guitars, has a country feel to it.  The combination of an expressive lead vocal with female backing singers fits the song's feel perfectly.  \\"Sister Luck\\" has a ROLLING STONES/\\"Exile On Main Street\\"  era sound and feel, with the subtle arrangement, including bottle neck guitar another highlight of the album.  The final track, \\"Bad Luck Blue Eyes Goodbye\\", is a ballad that is played and sung in the best BLACK CROWES tradition, and is a fitting end to a powerful collection of songs.<br /><br />This album, apparently the last for some time, is proof positive that THE BLACK CROWES  still have that certain \\"something\\" that other bands can only wish for.  The fact that this is a double album-at a low price, speaks volumes about the band.  But its in the music, the vocals, and the overall feel of these songs, where the band shows that they can deliver a collection of heartfelt songs.  From good time, bluesy rock 'n' roll, to delicately arranged ballads, to pumping gospel-its all here.  This set of songs sees the band bringing their sound in closer, yet all the visceral, emotional, and exciting musical feel is still readily apparent.  Quite a combination.  Everyone will have favorites on this collection, and its a testament to the band that the many moods heard here all sound authentic.  Its a shame that the band is disappearing from the scene for some time. On hearing this release you, too, will have to agree.lection of songs.<br /><br />This album, apparently the last for some time, is proof positive that THE BLACK CROWES  still have that certain \\"something\\" that other bands can only wish for.

1416562605|4.0|Mother India: land of the exotic, land of the sublime; a spiritual haven; a place to find inner peace. Have you been, Western seeker? All I can say is read this book first, but still you will not understand the Darkness and the Light, so truly presented by this acute observer, Arawad Adiga, who has written such a startlingly original piece of fiction. I say fiction, but the writer himself has said this fiction is based on observed facts, people he has known, and the state of affairs in India itself.<br /><br />This book has a voice, the voice of the lowly village boy who harbors a rare brilliance, a burning sense of his own worth, and the awful injustice that is his life in the Darkness. Yet, this story could have taken place in any Central American city or any African city or any third-world country: it's the story of poor people ensnared, servants of the rich who are always one step ahead of them; greedy people; inhuman people; well-intended people who are too weak to fight the ubiquitous corrupt system and so become part of it.<br /><br />This is an extraordinary work, a nightmarish work that shows the horrors of Indian poverty and what it takes to fight the Darkness and come to the Light. I know this work is fiction, but everything about it is extremely plausible. As a work of literature, it mimicks reality so sharply, presenting it in a garish, cruel, and biting light, that the reader is changed, cannot forget it, and is cut open by its nasty edges. Did I \\"enjoy\\" it? As an original read, yes, but as a dark and terrible reminder of what the world is like for millions of people, no. It was disturbing as hell, to say the least.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|Lost In Austen was a British mini series directed by Oscar winner Sam Mendes and written by Guy Andrews, and it was one of the most popular offerings on British television in 2008.<br /><br />In fact, it was so popular that they brought it to the big screen. This charming homage to Pride and Prejudice and Jane Austen herself is an absolute delight.<br /><br />Jemima Rooper is Amanda Price who steps through the portal between her reality and the fictional world inhabited by the Bennet family. Elliot Cowan is the smoldering Mr. Darcy. Hugh Bonneville is paternal as Mr. Bennet.<br /><br />Florence Hoath is Kitty Bennet. Alex Kingston is Mrs. Bennet. Morven Christie is Jane Bennet. Perdita Weeks is Lydia Bennet. Tom Mison is Mr. Bingley. Ruby Bentall is Mary Bennet. Christina Cole is Caroline Bingley, and Gemma Arterton is Elizabeth Bennet. Tom Riley is Mr. Wickham, and Guy Henry is Mr. Collins.<br /><br />The story goes like this. . . .<br /><br />Amanda Price is an ardent Jane Austen fan who has read Pride and Prejudice too many times. Saddled with a boozy boy friend who has no shred of romance in his soul, she longs for the genteel world inhabited by Elizabeth Bennet.<br /><br />When Amanda finds Elizabeth Bennet standing in her bathtub one night, her world as she knows it changes. Elizabeth tells her she stepped through a doorway in her attic, a door that had never opened before, and ended up in Amanda's bathrub. Before you can say alternate reality, Amanda is trapped in Jane Austen's world of mannered courtship and matchmaking intrigue.<br /><br />Of course, Amanda's presence changes the course of Austen's novel so the poor girl ends up trying to keep the story on course. I won't spoil the story. Suffice it to say that you'll be surprised. It's an affectionate homage that will enchant you and make you glad to be Lost In Austen.
B003S897UK|4.0|Three discs 62, 73, 63 minutes each approximately.  The sound is clean and warm with a good guitar sound in front of the rhythm section.  The booklet contains a short synopsis on each of the three sets, along with many color photos of the group (and guests).  The discs are snapped in, inside a tri-fold cardboard holder.  There's a list of tracks and song lengths and recording information.<br /><br />The first set is strictly GOV'T MULE playing some of their older material, along with smokin' covers of \\"21st Century Schizoid Man\\", \\"We're Not Gonna Take It\\", and a lengthy \\"Dazed and Confused\\".  This is the band that most people will readily know, with Warren Haynes guitar and insistent vocals out front of a powerhouse rhythm section.  Several tracks are lengthy, giving the band time to work through whatever they feel like playing.  From all out assaults like \\"Blind Man In The Dark\\", to slower songs like \\"Life Before Insanity\\", the band show they can adapt their style to any tempo.  This sets the scene for whats to come.<br /><br />The second set is given over to the blues, with blues great Little Milton, a long time blues singer/guitar player.  The tempos range from shuffles to slow blues. Among the songs are the well known \\"I Can't Quit You Baby\\", \\"It Hurts Me Too\\", with Elmore James-like slide guitar, and \\"Blues Is Alright\\".  The set finishes up with \\"Power of Soul\\".  The guitars of Haynes and Little Milton weave in and out of these songs, and its on the slow blues where they particularly shine.<br /><br />The third set consists mainly of covers, starting with \\"Helter Skelter\\", which roars out with a lot of power.  \\"30 Days In The Hole\\", by HUMBLE PIE, Dylan's \\"I Shall Be Released\\", and a great rendition of \\"Simple Man\\" by LYNYRD SKYNYRD round out this set.  The addition of peddle steel played by Mark Van Allan, and additional guitar from Audley Freed gives this song an extra depth and punch.<br /><br />This is another concert recorded on New Year's Eve (in 1999), and its hard to understand why it took so long to be released.  This is prime GOV'T MULE, with the addition of a true bluesman and other friends/musicians which set this music apart from other releases.  The band is well known for their New Year's Eve blow-outs, and these three sets are as good as any previous live recordings by the band.  Tap in and listen to any of the tracks here and you'll hear what I mean.took so long to be released.

0143116371|3.0|On-the-street fashions are the best. I picked this book up specifically because I was looking for a book of street fashions. I enjoyed this one. It has a lot of beautiful looks in it, but it doesn't have the FORCE of [[ASIN:0714840831 Fruits]] or [[ASIN:0446692824 Vice Dos and Don'ts: 10 Years of VICE Magazine's Street Fashion Critiques]]. Like I said, there's some inspiration in here, and some originality, but mostly it's photographs of thin rich people wearing expensive clothes.<br /><br />I mean, it's nice to see rich people who aren't boring...
B001EYGOEM|5.0|i love this album and have listed to it over and over for the past year!!!!!!!! it is orginal, heartwarming, sentimental, sweet and artistic! if i had nothing else to do with my life i would just listen to this album over and over!! yes folks it is that good and shame on you if you have not bought it!! my number one fav is you belong with me!!!! dont forget to buy the music vids to go along with it!!:)
B001GSV3EC|5.0|Jeff Beck: Iconic guitar player.  This album takes the Beck legacy to a new level.  As a live album, the production is excellent, but its Beck's 'live' playing that is so fantastic.  How many rock/blues players would take on \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" and make it work? Really different, unigue, and shows genuine artistry.  It's the \\"Day In the Life\\" cut that is a total stand-out.  Superb playing, great arrangement, excellent side-players and genuinely creative.  A few Beck classics aided by modern electronics finish out the extensive set.  While other excellent players seem to doing more of the same year-after-year, Beck is blazing a new trail with this album and expanding his art.  This is Jeff Beck at his best.
B001IF277K|4.0|the best of this purchase to this seller is that the product is what I was expecting and faster shipping. The quality of this battery is very good.
B002O3Z4Y8|5.0|Awesome movie. Glad to own it. Very fast shipping and very reasonable cost wise. It is nice to find movies you cannot find in stores.  I will definately be buying more!
B003HARV3Y|5.0|this was a thoughrolly enticing movie with plot twists and cliff hangers which made me smile, giggle and even in the antie em's part cry with fear and then relief when medusa was vanquished! mostly i felt this movie should be purchased for the sight of the very attractive young actor portraying percy! he is so gorgeous and we are the same age so i think by the time you read this the two of us will be happily married and living in brazil but back to the movie..... it is very timeless and perfect for the adventuresome sort of girl (and i guess boy if your interested) and if your between the ages of 10  and 19 and not afraid of monsters under your bed or the dark then i believe this movie is a good buy!!!!
0316044695|5.0|The story presented here is one of sheer bravery and perseverance. I literally could not stop reading this book. Luttrell gives a vivid account of Operation Red Wing and describes the nightmare in finite detail. You feel as if your on the mission with him and his SEAL team. This is by far the best story I have read so far of all the current conflict (Iraq and Afghanistan)books.
0061801313|5.0|I bought this set to read before I watch the new series on ABC Family. The books are awesome!! The box set is perfect if you plan on reading the entire series (while I imagine everyone would) because it makes the per-book price much lower than buying them separately. I definitely recommend buying this!
B003EYVXTG|4.0|Ree has enough to deal with, even before she finds out her house is due to be taken away. She's just seventeen, and stuck running the household, with two younger siblings to feed and a catatonic mother to care for. &#34;Don't never ask for nothing what ought to be offered&#34; is the motto of this resourceful and proud young woman. She does a good job, given meager resources - but her father's been away a long time, out on bail for cooking crystal meth, and he put up the house and the land as collateral. The only thing for it is to find him, and nobody wants to help, and she comes to see that knowing can be dangerous.<br /><br />For a small-scale, low-budget, independent feature, the film looks great: the desolate beauty of the landscapes, the delicate montages of the two innocent and largely unaware siblings engaged in resourceful play, the authentic settings, and the seasonal lighting. The film as a whole is richly imagined, with strong performances and an unsettling mood. The story is strong, managing to convey without exposition or voiceover the tension that exists in this region between a rich folk tradition and a stark economic necessity that has driven many of the locals to support themselves through the illegal drug trade, and the tension between familial loyalty and the need for self-preservation. At times it felt like perhaps the screenplay undercut the realism - it aimed so deliberately at economy of exposition that the characters become something like vernacular poets, implausibly tending to convey a wealth of details with a minimum of words, rather than just being reticent Still, the sense of mystery that drives Ree's exploration is sustained throughout, and kept me on the edge of my seat and caring throughout. This isn't a masterpiece, but is solid storytelling that creates the right atmosphere, and makes the most of limited resources.<br /><br />Jennifer Lawrence immersed herself thoroughly in character as Ree, and her uncle &#34;Teardrop&#34; was brilliantly played by Tom Hawkes, who always seemed more vulnerable in other roles I've seen him in, such as Deadwood, but he's fierce here, and convinced me as someone you wouldn't want to mess with. What I found perhaps most fascinating was the characterization of some of the other women in the story, who serve as gatekeepers to the clan leader, Floyd. They seemed at first heartlessly vicious, but it struck me later they didn't like to be violent and saw their brutality as a kind of kindness, intended to protect. A powerful film, that stands up well to similarly powerful films about surprisingly strong individuals facing impossible circumstances in the midst of destitution, such as Trouble the Water and Undertow.lliantly played by Tom Hawkes, who always seemed more vulnerable in other roles I've seen him in, such as Deadwood, but he's fierce here, and convinced me as someone you wouldn't want to mess with.

0156027321|5.0|This is a great book to read for all ages. I couldn't put the book down until I finished it.
0743270754|5.0|I just completed reading this book and it was terrific. Kearns really takes you back in time and you get a great sense of how all these men developed into the men that would serve Lincoln. The amount of tragedy and perseverance this men and the families went through is almost impossible to believe.    Lincoln was continually underestimated and treated a \\"country bumpkin\\" but yet, time and time again proved to his supporters, critics, and rivals that he knew what he was doing. Again, Kearns paints a vivid picture of this time period and of how Lincoln was able to keep the nation together, even though he had to work with some pretty uncooperative folks.    Great read and I highly recommend it.
0307266303|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  The author had a very exciting story to tell and he did it well.  The tangent of how we evolved into the running man was fascinating. In addition, I liked that he found an alternative answer to the normal problems of running injuries.    I definitely recommend this book.
B00006J3WH|5.0|This CD is the essential musical companion to the classical episode of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer: Once More With Feeling (Season 6)\\". Not only are all the songs brilliantly written by Joss Whedon, the tunes are SO catchy, this CD will have you whistling for weeks (believe me, I speak from experience).<br /><br />MAIN TITLE - For this episode, they fixed the regular rock-out version of the theme by Nerf Herder, into a musical, classical version. Although with no words and only 26 seconds, it is still rather amusing to listen to.<br /><br />OVERTURE/GOING THROUGH THE MOTIONS - The overture of the CD takes place in the beginning of the episode, and while it has no words, is very soothing and peppy (if a song can be both those things). It leads into Going Through the Motions after roughly a minute and 10 seconds, which is the brilliant Sarah Michelle Gellar singing the first song. Definitely one of my favorite songs.<br /><br />I'VE GOT A THEORY/BUNNIES/IF WE'RE TOGETHER - This song has many different tunes and portions to it. I've Got a Theory, the first part, is sung by Anthony Head, Alyson Hannigan, Nicholas Brendan, and Emma Caulfield. It soon leads into \\"Bunnies\\", sung by Emma Caulfield, which is a rock-version of why she hates bunnies so much. Makes me laugh EVERY TIME! Finally, If We're Together is a very Scooby Gang song, with Buffy telling her friends that they can beat anything. Heartwarming! :)<br /><br />THE MUSTARD - While only 20 seconds, this song makes me laugh out loud, every time I listen to it. Only 5 lines sung by a big burly man. \\"They got the mustard OUT!\\" No more needs to be said.<br /><br />UNDER YOUR SPELL - Amber Benson's voice is just magic in this song. I have hummed, whistled, and sung the tune for weeks at a time; even learned to play it on the piano and sing along. So powerful and a beautiful love song of Tara and Willow's love. *sigh*. It makes you smile.<br /><br />I'LL NEVER TELL - Very, VERY 1950s. Upbeat, and the lyrics, GOSH are they funny! Definitely suits Anya and Xander's relationship (who are played and sung by Emma Caulfield and Nicholas Brendan). Just hearing the soft, but upbeat, and extremely mocking lyrics make you laugh while listening. They continuily list their faults in each other. Though I must admit, I can not listen to it constantly like I can do with \\"Under your Spell\\". Still love it though!<br /><br />THE PARKING TICKET - Again, something to make you smile. Although it is 45 seconds, it is much like The Mustard, a look into how the other residents of Sunnydale are dealing with the singing. A woman croons to a police officer about how she doesn't deserve the parking ticket, with lyrics like \\"There was no parking anywhere,\\" and \\"I think that hydrent wasn't there\\". Definitely funny, if not anything else!<br /><br />REST IN PEACE - Sung by the brilliant, brooding, and completely amazing James Marsters, this song illustrates how Spike loves, but completely HATES Buffy. A rock out, vampiric, absolutely sick and awesome song. There's nothing else to say. Bloody amazing!<br /><br />DAWN'S LAMENT - It begins with the soft tune of \\"Under your Spell\\", but quickly turns into a soft guitar melody of Michelle Trachtenberg singing only 8 words. \\"Does anyone even notice? Does anybody even care?\\" Then it cuts off with a large screeching and intense music part, as Dawn is kidnapped. While not one of my favorite songs, and still only a minute and 20 seconds, it is still sweet.<br /><br />DAWN'S BALLET - This song redeems the last. In the actual episode, Michelle Trachtenberg's dance moves fit in perfectly with this song, swaying with the lyrics. And while it doesn't have any words, is very intense and, eh, orchestraeey? (I doubt that's a word). It's rather hard to explain, but I definitely give this song a thumbs up!<br /><br />WHAT YOU FEEL - I don't exactly know the name of the actor who played Sweets in this episode, the demon who causes the singing, but he does amazing in a jazz song sung toDawn. His deep voice blends together perfectly with the song. Really amazing!<br /><br />STANDING - Ah, Anthony Stewart Head. With him portraying Giles, in this song, he sings about how he believes that if Buffy is ever to grow up, he needs to leave. With lines like \\"I know I said that I'd be standing by your side,\\" and \\"so you just lie there when you should be standing tall,\\" this song was a tear-jerker (well, for me anyway). Definitely a beautiful song.<br /><br />UNDER YOUR SPELL/STANDING (REPRISE) - Wow. What can I say about this song? Amber Benson and Anthony Head's deep and beautiful voices blend together absolutely perfectly! At this time in the series, both of their characters are contemplating the fact that they need to leave the ones they love: Willow and Buffy. \\"Wish I could stay.\\" It starts off with Amber singing new lyrics to the tune of Under your Spell, but then melds into a mix of Standing and Under your Spell. Two thumbs up!<br /><br />WALK THROUGH THE FIRE - Ah, the amazing and talented Sarah Michelle Gellar. All of the cast has really outdone themselves in this song. Sarah M. Gellar starts off singing softly with a guitar tune, which progresses powerfully. Then James Marsters cuts in, singing individually and then with Sweets. Then the Scooby Gang cuts in, then Buffy/Sarah Michelle, and then everyone together! It is just a mix of pure genius!<br /><br />SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT - Again, it's the brilliant Sarah Michelle Gellar/Buffy who takes this song, singing her heart out to her friends, her enemies, and her sister. In the series, the Scooby Gang don't know Buffy was in heaven, and so in this song, she confesses that's where she was. Very powerful and sad, but pretty, with a little interruption from James Marsters at the end.<br /><br />WHAT YOU FEEL (REPRISE) - Although this short song is only 46 seconds, it takes on the tune of What you Feel, with new lyrics of how Sweets promises that even though he lost, the gang will definitely feel like they lost too.<br /><br />WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE? - And so, on that note, this song is by the whole Scooby Gang, lamenting about how even though they battle evil together, they really don't know what is going to happen next. \\"Understand we'll go hand in hand but we'll walk alone in fear.\\" The revelation about Buffy has rather shook them, and this is their last song (well, the Scooby's last song together). Powerful and very enjoyable. One of my favorite songs on the CD.<br /><br />CODA - A very short snippet with Sarah Michelle Gellar (Buffy), and James Marsters (Spike). With only 41 seconds, Buffy sings to the tune of Walk through the Fire, and Spike sings to Rest in Peace. In the end, they meet up with the Scoobies singing \\"Where do we go from here?\\" Rather good, in my opinion.<br /><br />END CREDITS (BROOM DANCE/GRR ARGH) - Basically, for the end credits, the brilliant Joss Whedon took Where do we go from Here, and but it into a jazzy, '50s, 34 second song. Really funny, and can easily bop your head to!<br /><br />SOMETHING TO SING ABOUT (DEMO) - Hm, well, this might be the only song on the CD that I do not like. It's not like I hate it with a passion, but it is rather a waste. From what I've heard, it's Joss Whedon's wife singing a demo of Something to Sing About, originally sung by Sarah Michelle Gellar. It's not that she's a bad singer, it just sounds...wrong. That's my two cents.<br /><br />SACRIFICE (FROM \\"THE GIFT\\") - Oh gosh, this song makes me cry every time. Or at least, makes me choke up. It's the suite from the end of Season 5, when Buffy sacrifices herself for Dawn (hence the name \\"Sacrifice\\"). It's very powerful and sad. It makes me remember that last few moments of the episode \\"The Gift.\\" Yep, that episode always made me cry too. Very good addition to the CD!<br /><br />SUITE FROM \\"HUSH\\": SILENT KNIGHT/FIRST KISS/ENTER THE GENTLEMEN/SCHISM - Woo, that's a long title. This is a very long song, I think it's just about 7 minutes. It basically takes allthe music from the episode Hush from Season 4, and condenses it into one song. It's very creepy and haunting, but there's a lot of it, because that episode was basically all music. It's ok, but I don't like it as much as I like Sacrifice.<br /><br />SUITE FROM \\"RESTLESS\\": WILLOW'S NIGHTMARE/FIRST RAGE/CHAIN OF ANCIENTS - This song is from the last episode of Season 4: Restless. I really love the first minute of it, but then it goes all congo drumish, and I don't really like it until the 3 minute mark, where Buffy is interacting with the First Slayer in the episode. That part is really haunting, and beautiful. All in all, I like this song better than Suite from Hush, but it's not my favorite.<br /><br />Ok, I believe that is all the songs on this album. Basically, buy the CD. Amazing songs, and all of them are definitely worth your money!ven though they battle evil together, they really don't know what is going to happen next. \\"Understand we'll go hand in hand but we'll walk alone in fear.\\" The revelation about Buffy has rather shook them, and this is their last song (well, the Scooby's last song together).

B003LXM1RS|5.0|I am not usually a devotee of electronic-dance-club music, but then I'm not sure Scissors Sisters fits into that genre.  Maybe they are a genre onto themselves (boy that sounds pretentious just typing it).  I find much of what passes for the dance genre ends up being noise over talent.  With the Scissors Sisters it is clearly talent over noise.  It is as if someone took some early 1980s Prince and mashed it with Duran Duran-style vocals.  Like much of Prince's early work, the themes and lyrics are not family friendly.    If none of the first four songs grab you, check your pulse.  Night Work pounds its way into Whole New Way which totally hooked me only 4 bars in. WNW accomplishes the feat of being both catchy and risque. Any Which Way, Something Like This, and Skin This Cat are also winners and I suspect that one or two more tracks will grow on me.
B002ZG9846|4.0|Be warned: this review contains mild spoilers.<br /><br />Aside from Hollywood's neverending quest to remake every movie from the past fifty years, film producers have been in an unapologetic superhero mode since the late nineties, cranking out favorites from X-Men to Spider Man and back again (they're rebooting Spidey, you know). Still even more are on the way, evidenced by news of the upcoming Avengers and Green Hornet movies. As a result nearly every marginally successful comic book or graphic novel one can imagine has been optioned for a cinematic adaptation. Whether or not this is a good thing is debatable. Sometimes we receive an emotionally gripping, contemporary classic like \\"Road to Perdition\\" (also, coincidentally, released on Blu-Ray today). Other times we're presented with godawful tripe like \\"Whiteout\\". The less said about that one, the better.<br /><br />Personally I think it's a good thing, as there are dozens of sharply original, brilliantly innovative graphic novels that have yet to enjoy life on the silver screen. Every comic fan has their wishlist of favorites they'd like to see reinvented visually, and my personal choices are the \\"Preacher\\" and \\"Grendel\\" series. I'd love to see what a visceral director like Zach Snyder could do with either of those properties. But the trend in the comic book world isn't focused so much on actual heroes anymore, it's gradually shifted towards the 'everyman does the incredible' template.<br /><br />We certainly see this trend manifested in \\"Kick Ass\\", as well as films like \\"Defendor\\" and the more recent \\"Scott Pilgrim vs the World\\". I must admit, even being a comic fan, \\"Kick Ass\\" never featured on my list of most wanted comic-films. It's somewhat original, in that there hasn't been a deluge of comics revolving around a kid who decides overnight to become a costumed crimefighter, but the comic itself was a bit on-the-nose in its themes and more than a little puerile in tone. I found it pleasant light reading but rather forgettable. The problem is that there's absolutely nothing deeper going on other than what's on the page, and as a result it's something one could read and fully comprehend whilst simultaneously watching television or chatting on the telephone (both of which I did).<br /><br />Of course, I'm fast approaching 30, and it's clear this film is primarily targeted towards those in their early-to-mid teenage years (which bizarrely clashes with the hard R rating, I might add). There's the by-the-numbers plotting, cookie cutter gangster stereotypes, and a youthful cast of socially inept comic loving geeks and stunningly attractive girls. In the end, \\"Kick Ass\\" is a much less depressing film than \\"Defendor\\" and plotwise it even manages to be less ridiculous than \\"Scott Pilgrim\\", but it never quite rises above the barely-adequate comic that inspired it.<br /><br />The performances are strong, particularly Aaron Johnson as our everyman crimefighter Kick Ass and Chloe Moretz as the pre-teen, foul-mouthed baddie assassin Hit-Girl. Nicolas Cage is the greatest surprise here, being without question the most famed member of the cast, but also known for his occasionally spotty performances. Here, he masterfully plays a slightly twisted but unquestionably devoted father by day and the Batman-inspired Big Daddy by night, replete with awkward Shatner-esque pauses in his speech. Mark Strong can always portray a convincing villan, and his role here as gangster leader Frank D'Amico is no different. Sadly, the immensely talented Jason Flemyng is inexplicably wasted (his total screentime amounts to under two minutes).<br /><br />Even worse, the greatest detriment to the film is director Matthew Vaughn, primarily known for his close collaborations with Guy Ritchie and for directing both \\"Layer Cake\\" and \\"Stardust\\". Though \\"Layer Cake\\" is a fine British gangster thriller, Vaughn has been riding the coattails of Richie's success for far too long now. Here, for instance, Vaughn confuses overused tropes with stylistic innovation, inserts obnoxious licensed music tracks where they're not required, and splices the action scenes with so many cuts it's impossible to tell what's really going on.<br /><br />Thankfully, the crew in \\"Kick Ass\\" helpfully provided explosive CGI blood spurts to let the audience know who is getting killed in what fashion. Nothing in the action scenes, however, is as eye-melting and seizure-inducing as the extended sequence in which Hit-Girl activates a strobe feature on the flashlight attachment to her pistol. The resultant fast-paced flashes of bright white light against a pitch black background will cause most in a darkened theater room to shield their eyes in anguish for an effect that essentially strangles any possible excitement out of the scene to begin with.<br /><br />But the crux of the problem with \\"Kick Ass\\" is its wildly uneven tone, as if Vaughn could never truly decide just what sort of film he wanted to create. The film begins by engaging the viewer in a series of silly slapstick gags along with some lowbrow teenage humor from its high-school age cast, then suddenly thrusts the audience into the realm of bloody, brutal violence when a character is stabbed in the torso. As he staggers away, bleeding profusely, he's subsequently struck by a speeding car. The film strangely expects the audience to suddenly feel genuine pathos for characters the film itself never took very seriously to begin with.<br /><br />It's not only the one instance, either, the film consistently flip-flops between being violent, dark, and deadly solemn to being too ridiculously silly and absurd to take seriously. Another example would be the gangster characters, who are generally quite dopey and have names that sound as if they were inspired by the Seven Dwarves or the Spice Girls (i.e. Sporty Goon, Scary Goon, Baby Goon, etc.). That makes them sound like amusing and inept Dick Tracy villans, but these characters frequently spew foul language and commit cold-blooded murder. Suffice it to say that the moments \\"Kick Ass\\" ceases to take itself so seriously are always the best scenes in the film.<br /><br />The score to \\"Kick Ass\\" is really quite good, the very few moments it's allowed to make an appearance. The bulk of the film's soundtrack is comprised of licensed music tracks, which form a trippy mix of every genre in the book. It's painfully obvious they were stretching to achieve a highly stylized look and sound akin to Snyder's work, but Vaughn doesn't have the chops for this sort of thing. For every skillfully used track (i.e. the amusing scene in which the boys are cruising to the sounds of \\"Crazy\\" by Gnarls Barkley) there are three others that sound wholly out of place. Some film school teacher somewhere must still be instructing their students that placing decades-old classic crooner ballads within bloody, violent action sequences is still trendy, stylish, or otherwise interesting. Snyder did it with \\"Watchmen\\", and now Vaughn has inserted Elvis Presley's \\"Battle Hymn of the Republic\\" during a climatic sequence in which Kick Ass is piloting a rocketpack with dual gatling guns blazing away.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray is presented by Lionsgate in a fittingly color-rish transfer that, while certainly not benchmark material, looks quite sharp and detailed. Included within the case are three discs: the Blu-Ray, a DVD containing a standard definition copy of the film, and the ubiquitous digital copy on the third disc. There are five special features on the Blu-Ray disc, which are as follows:<br /><br />1) \\"Ass Kicking Bonusview Mode\\" - An feature-length interactive commentary with director Matthew Vaughn that also includes bonus footage and interview excepts. To give a better idea - this offers the same basic function as the \\"Maximum Movie Mode\\" on Warner Bros. titles such as \\"Sherlock Holmes\\", \\"Watchmen\\", \\"Terminator Salvation\\", or \\"Cop Out\\". Vaughn's solo commentary track is also included sans the bells andwhistles.<br /><br />2) \\"A New Kind of Superhero: The Making of Kick Ass\\" (1:53:04) - A sprawling making-of feature that covers every aspect of production, from casting to sound effects and even smaller details such as finding a suitable distributor for the film.<br /><br />3) \\"It's On: The Comic Book Origins of Kick Ass\\" (20:36) - This turned out to be my personal favorite feature, one which (obviously) covers the source material of the film.<br /><br />4) \\"Marketing Archive\\" - Includes two trailers (including the controversial redband Hit-Girl trailer) and a fairly extensive gallery of movie posters.<br /><br />5) \\"The Art of Kick Ass\\" - A huge photo gallery covering all aspects of the film's production.<br /><br />Ultimately, \\"Kick Ass\\" is an entertaining, action-packed summer film that nearly any teenager (or excessively youthful adult) is bound to revel in. My attention was held for the entire two hours, which is more than I can say for a good deal of recent flicks (I'm looking at you, \\"Repo Men\\") and despite my quibbles the film often amused me. The film has such an excellent, original premise that it's unfortunate the execution was somewhat botched.<br /><br />With that in mind, fans certainly won't be disappointed with the Blu-Ray presentation, but I'd advise a rental to those who haven't gotten around to seeing it yet. Were it not for Vaughn's scattershot directing, I would've been able to offer a much stronger recommendation. So, considering I'm not a member of this film's intended demographic, and it's certainly never boring, I think 3.5 stars is a fair rating (rounded up to 4 in light of Amazon's rating limitations). Besides, there was a time when I would've adored this film, it simply arrived fifteen years too late for me.s \\"Kick Ass\\" ceases to take itself so seriously are always the best scenes in the film.

1594202559|5.0|The splashy title \\"More Money Than God\\" doesn't do Sebastian Mallaby's hedge fund chronicle justice. It sounds like a gossipy tour of New Gilded Age wealth. Hedge fund managers are among the nouveau mega-riche, but that's not what Mallaby's book is about. This is a history of the major developments in hedge funds from Alfred Winslow Jones' pioneering \\"hedged fund\\" in 1949 through John Paulson's 2007 coup in shorting sub-prime mortgage securities and beyond. Mallaby defends hedge funds against the rash of criticism that their successes and failures in the past few years has unleashed by chronicling the changing role and increasing power of hedge funds over the past 60 years. He presents both views of hedge funds, with examples: They make markets more efficient and stable and led the flow of capital to the developing world. Their aggression and high leverage can be a destabilizing force, and their history is not free of underhanded tactics.<br /><br />Mallaby lets the larger-than-life personalities of hedge fund magnates lead us through his history. He chooses hedge fund managers whose innovations influenced the industry: Alfred Winslow Jones' hedged fund that made 5000% in 20 years of the post-war era, Michael Steinhardt's success in the 1960s and 1970s with contrarian ideas, monetary analysis, and block trading, the econometrics of Commodities Corporation, Bruce Kovner's \\"carry trade\\", George Soros and Stan Druckenmiller's currency speculation in the 1990s, the superior stock-picking of Julian Hart Robertson's Tiger Fund, Paul Tudor Jones II's market moving, Long-Term Capital Management's lesson in leveraged finance, James Simon's Medallion Fund and David Shaw's fund as different styles of quantitative trading, Ken Griffin's multi-strategy Citidel, Amaranth's 2006 blow-up, August 2007's \\"quant quake\\", and more.<br /><br />Mallaby admires hedge funds, because they find more success than investment banks with less systemic risk and no taxpayer-funded bailouts, but he doesn't avoid legitimate qualms about their role. Mallaby concludes by making a case against regulating funds with fewer than $120 billion in assets. He points out the hedge funds blow up all the time (5,000 failed between 2000 and 2009) but still fare better than investment banks or the S&P, even after correcting for survivorship bias. Mallaby's approach to the good and bad of hedge funds is thoughtful and engaging. I was surprised how much I enjoyed this book. It's a gold mine of information for those who are not sure what a hedge fund is or what they do, and it can serve as a (patchy) introduction to global finance. For those who read the Financial Times every day, \\"More Money Than God\\" is a compelling history of the industry and a fun read, even if some of it will be old news.gitimate qualms about their role.

B002VECLVO|1.0|This is a horrible, horrible film from someone who decided, like many in glitterati world, they are capable of directing. Not sure which part of this flop is a book and which part is Tom Ford's ineptness, but the film is filled with childish, uninspired, and unnatural dialog, extended pointless and boring scenes and inability of the actors to communicate their feelings to the viewer. The dialog is really of a kind you will find in pulp novels with muscled man and half-clad women in ecstasy on the covers. Some reviews here state that the film is stylish, that is probably because Tom Ford, living in his imaginary world, filled the film with shots of expensive suits, slim ties, and polished shoes. However, this did not make it stylish, instead it reminded of Zoolander. Perhaps any shot of fancy clothes and an old car makes the film look stylish for some. Bottom line, completely unrealistic portrayal of a gay professor was coupled with gratuitous scenes of \\"glowing men\\" and random shots of sweaty masculine bodies.   This brings us to the most important critique of this movie. According to recent studies, less than 2% of population in US is gay. Was this film made only for them? Like any normal person, I assumed that Single Man would depict a man suffering a loss of his wife. That is a normal expectation for those of us who perceive man-woman relationship to be natural. Needless to say, it was very hard, if not impossible, for me to relate to the loss of the main character when, to my surprise, I realized that the loss was that of a boyfriend!?!? The complete weirdness of the plot paired with Tom Ford's ineptitude as a director made this movie a complete waste of ... less than two hours, because I mostly fast-forwarded through absurd scenes in the second half of the movie. Before, many of you jump into conclusions in view of the last few sentences, I will say that many movies manage to include sexual minority themes and gay protagonists without completely alienating thegeneral public. There was Capote; there was Bitter Moon and others. This film is an overdone, pretentious attempt for originality, which fails miserably because Tom Ford has no idea how to communicate feelings, emotions, and thoughts coherently and realistically.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|This is a fantastic supplement to the BBC Earth Series and Planet Earth.  I have only seen about 4 of the 12 sections of it, but it is absolutely amazing.  It's so much better being narrated by David Attenborough instead of Oprah Winfrey!  The visuals are stunning, and the commentary is witty and fun.  I would recommend this to anyone who wants to just relax and see how all kinds of life happens on our amazing planet.
B002ZG9846|5.0|Most of the other reviews (and Amazon description) have already gone over the movie/storyline, so I'll focus on just the Blu-Ray itself and my thoughts of the movie.<br /><br />I really enjoyed this one - after hearing much about it while it was in theaters, I had pretty high hopes/expectations for it and I can honestly say I wasn't let down by them (something rare!). I thought the movie was well paced with a good amount of action, comedy and storyline.. plus the characters were great! Something enjoyable by people of most ages (though you might wanna leave the kids out for this one).<br /><br />One of the big surprises here was the Blu-Ray itself.. I guess I wasn't expecting too much, but Lionsgate really delivered. Clarity is incredible and has some nice (saturated) colors throughout. Almost comparable to Gamer and the Crank films on Blu-Ray with just how nice it looked. An easy 5/5 for me.<br /><br />Audio was also top notch - nicely uses all the speakers and will give a home theater a real workout.  I believe this was another DTS-HD MA 7.1 track from Lionsgate.<br /><br />Extras don't stop either.. you get the Blu-Ray, DVD and a Digital Copy (for your iPod/iPhone/iPad). I know some don't care for the DVD or Digital copy, but I'm definitely a fan. It's also got the in-movie-experience (always fun and really show off the blu-ray), commentary and some behind the scenes extras.<br /><br />Overall a fantastic package that I have to give a 5/5 to in each category. Movie, Video, Audio, Extras. Check it out!

0380713802|5.0|Bill Bryson is to embellishment like a hammer is to a nail. They go together.<br /><br />Slamming his typical sarcastic wit to the sights, sounds, smells and situations throughout his European travels, Bryson rivets the reader with an imbibed smile. Swallow it down. This is humor at its sneering finest.<br /><br />I've never had a desire to go to Europe. Just never have. Still don't. But to read of Bryson's experiences and the way he details it, makes for a fun read. Sure there is exaggeration and ridicule, so what? This is what makes life enjoyable.<br /><br />Some can not take embellishment or fault-finding humor (evidently they missed out on the laugh chromosome when born or developed that way later in life). Sad. They are missing out. What a dull, gray existence if one can not laugh at themself or get a chuckle from observing others. Might as well live in a cave. Which nowadays many seem to do.<br /><br />Anyway, if there is anyone to bring a smile within the pages of a book, it is Bill Bryson.

B000002LJW|5.0|Eric Clapton's mid/late 80's comeback albums wound up coming gradually in the form of three albums. The previous two had followed up directly one year after another and it took another few years for this album to come out-the final album in what could be called a comeback triad. Now this album rates somewhat higher among Clapton fans than either [[ASIN:B000002L6U Behind the Sun]] and [[ASIN:B000002LA2 August]]. Now that doesn't mean this album is a total return to the blues. It isn't and Clapton would'nt even do that until a few years after this came out. What this album represents is a very musically successful channeling of everything that Clapton had done on all of his 80's albums. Aside from his band from that era,which are very much in attendance here there are a number of special guests here-everyone from old musician pals Jim Keltner and George Harrison as well as David Sanborn,Chaka Khan,Linda & Cecil Womack and (although lesser known) former Gino Vannelli backup singer Loni Graves. All the same none of these people keep the album from losing focus on the main performer. On every front,from composition to vocal interpretation this album brings together all the best qualities of the two albums that came before it. So this album is still very much rooted in the 80's style retro/modern style Clapton had been dealing with but the amazing thing here is how eclectic this record musically while maintaining a very distinctive flavor overall. Actually the album ends with a blues number,a version of Bo Diddley's \\"Before You Accuse Me\\" and for a more modernized Robert Cray style blues approch Clapton also tackles \\"Hound Dog\\" and yes;he does the Big Mama Thornton version here. Two sultry soul ballads in \\"Running On Faith\\" and \\"Hard Times\\" are especially powerful as Clapton gets a dead on,emotionally complex pleading vocal and piano arrangement straight from the Ray Charles school of blues/soul slow jams of the 50's and 60's. \\"Run So Far\\" brings in Harrison for a number that would not have been too out of place on his own [[ASIN:B00014TJ7K Cloud Nine]] album while \\"Lead Me On\\" showcases Richard Tee's distinctive revered electric piano for a very elegant slow R&B/funk groove. Now if you want serious funk there's \\"Breaking Point\\"-along with Steve Ferrone,Nathan East and former Jeff Lorber synthesizer man Jeff Bova carrying the sound it's one of the best examples of late 80's synth funk Clapton ever waxed and,trust me he had a handfull of great ones on the albums prior to this one. So whether your taste is mellow retro blues,pop soul,blues rock,contemporary funk or any combination of all of them there is sure to be something here that will do the trick for your ears. And obviously the whole experience provided Clapton with a newfound sense of confidence and self satisfaction that would carry him into the 1990's.rings in Harrison for a number that would not have been too out of place on his own [[ASIN:B00014TJ7K Cloud Nine]] album while \\"Lead Me On\\" showcases Richard Tee's distinctive revered electric piano for a very elegant slow R&B/funk groove.

B001FB5634|3.0|It is an upbeat movie for a post-apocalyptic tale where there is no food except can goods and grains (which are increasingly harder to find) and other humans.  I haven't read the book, but it must be the prose that makes the book great. The movie sets the tone flawlessly. The sets are great. The atmosphere is gloomy. Everything is pretty much shades of gray. Viggo does a great job. Charlize Theron is very good. The boy is good. He is a little too cherubic for starving to death, but he is good. Robert Duvall has a bit part and he is great. The relationship between the boy and father seems real.     My only criticism was the plot. You never know what happened to world that caused almost every living thing to die, but left scores of humans alive. Plants were dying. No animals were seen except at the very end: a beetle, a bird and a pet dog. How did the pet dog survive? The movie was relentless and the end seemed almost too happy. The images and some of the conversations were striking.     The movie is hard to watch and it is hard to recommend. Is is worth two hours of someone's life to see such a hopeless movie? The acting and production values are excellent, but the pacing is slow at times and the movie just grinds on relentlessly like Viggo's character who grinds on and he is not sure why.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|Great movie.My 2 year old,4 year old and 9 year old sat all the way through this movie and wanted more.I would recommend this to everyone.
B002QGUFWE|5.0|I love this album.  You can buy the 2 discs separately or together in a deluxe version.  I have the deluxe version, but some people already had \\"The Fame,\\" so it's good for them that they can just buy the second disc and don't have to get 2 copies of the first one.  As for the music, it's catchy and fun.  The only song I'm not really crazy about is \\"Bad Romance.\\"
B000MV8XPG|4.0|My grandson loves this digger - has it in a big pea-gravel patch, and took it to the beach last week. It was fairly easy for the two of us to put together - at 4, he was able to interpret the pictoral instructions and find various parts.     The flaws: There is one bolt on the arm that is impossible to finger-tighten, and it took some asking around to borrow an adjustable wrench small enough to use. And the wheelbase could be a little broader. My grandson has to brace with his feet when the arm is extended.    Overall, the quality is good. Some of the plastic parts seem perhaps a little lacking in heft, but it's probably good for a couple of years of play.
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|A little dark for my taste but after watching the series it is interesting to know where Reavers come from.  Rivers' fight scenes are pretty awesome.  Did not enjoy the movie as much as I did the series; not enough of the light humor presented in the series.
B003EYVXSC|5.0|I managed to see Micmacs and thoroughly loved it. In true Jeunet fashion, characters have their specific quirks and little side-plot elements abound through the movie. A lot of what make movies like Delicatessen, Amelie, and City of Lost Children have this sometimes absurd but magical fantasy about them is present here but not overly gratuitous. Just the right amount and exactly how you'd expect it.    I've likened this movie to Three Stooges meets the A-Team versus Goliath. Really, two Goliaths. The plot is that Bazil's dad get blown up trying to defuse a mine made by a arms company. Later in his life, he is accidentally shot and the bullet is that of another competing arms company. Seeking justice, Bazil tries to confront the companies but is rebuffed quite strongly. He's then adopted by a rag-tag bunch of \\"orphans\\" called the Micmacs of the Slide Whistle who then join together to help Bazil take down the arms companies who have destroyed his life.    In true Jeunet fashion, we are introduced to each character who has a special talent that is exploited for the purpose of bringing down the arms companies. The plot, sometimes absurd and hilarious and not intended to be taken so seriously (as one reviewer earlier apparently doesn't get it). It's a comedy first and foremost and has all the hallmarks we've come to know and love from Jeunet. It doesn't move as fast as Amelie or have the sometimes overwhelming fantasy and magic of City of Lost Children but, in its own right, moves at a pace appropriate for the characters. And of course, Dominique Pinon is just over the top and brilliant as usual. Well done.

They were SOOOOOOOOOO key to the enjoyment and structure of the story.    I won't go on -- if you loved and read the books, stay away from the movie.   I was warned but didn't listen.    PS.  I'm 58 years old; I read the books as recommended by one of my granddaughters, and thought they were just a whole lot of fun, and really a good read.    STUPID, STUPID MOVIE.

I simply cannot watch it.<br /><br />What is it with all these idiotic sci-fi comic book movies that Hollywood keeps churning out? Pathetic. I think I actually enjoyed the film the first time, because it had good action. But who the hell needs Batman and other silly characters like that in a film? I totally despised the Watchers. This one is better because it's more entertaining.<br /><br />But please Hollywood, lose the superheroes already.

I found the story enlightening - if sad.<br />Everybody will enjoy learning the real story behind what happened in 2008 in the financial markets.<br />The amazing truth is that nobody knew what was happening and what were the consequences of their actions
0679736646|5.0|I've always been deeply in love with Philip Dick's paranoid worlds. I love his books, I love his short stories, I even love things like Our Friends From Frolix 8. There is something raw and razor-sharp, almost clinical in Dick's writing, something that transcends style, ideas and story. You can always tell that a part of him - and it might very well be a dominant part - not only believes in what he writes, but lives it.    I haven't read all of Dick's books. I haven't even read half of them. Still I've read most of those whose names everyone knows, and I have read enough to think that even a genius of his magnitude would be hard pressed to write anything quite as good as Ubik twice. If I had to point at a single one of Philip Dick's works as his magnum opus, that would undoubtedly be it.    As Michael Marshall Smith aptly puts it in the forward of my edition of the book, there is a mind-boggling number of SF ideas in Ubik: time-travel; psychic abilities and their corresponding anti-abilities; the dead being kept in a state of \\"half-life\\" where they could be reached by the living; alternate realities and reality revision; futuristic space-faring society; dystopian economic system. Many authors would spin a book around any ONE of those, but for Philip Dick it's always what's underneath the flesh that matters, so he casually presents them ALL in the first ten pages of his novel.    In Ubik's world technology has advanced to the state where colonization of the Moon and other worlds is possible. Psychic phenomena are common and many people employ psychics in their business ventures or shadier dealings. And since no law could control such powers, the so called \\"prudence organizations\\" have appeared. Those who work in them have the ability to negate one psychic power like telepathy or precognition. Meanwhile, people could be put in \\"cold-pac\\" after death - a half-life existence that slowly diminishes until the person dies again, this time - forever.    The main character,Joe Chip, is a technician for Glen Runciter's prudence organization. When a client hires twelve agents to negate telepathic spies in his lunar facilities, Runciter and Chip travel with them to the Moon. The assignment turns out to be a trap, possibly set by the company's nemesis Ray Hollis (who leads an organization of psychics), and Glen Runciter is killed in the ensuing explosion. The party quickly returns to Earth to put him in cold-pac.    But afterwords the twelve agents and Joe Chip begin to experience strange reality shifts. Food and drink deteriorate prematurely, and the world seems to regress into the past. What's more disturbing, they all receive messages from Glen Runciter, implying that it is actually he who is alive, and they who are in cold-pac. And above all is the ever-present Ubik, appearing in commercials on TV and radio. Nobody knows what it is, but it is everywhere. And it is important.    Then the deaths begin...    Ubik is a deeply unsettling book. The characters' hold on reality is at best loose, and the uncertainty they feel as to the nature of their very existence seeps into the reader's own mind, turning the novel into almost a horror story. When the action and the race (quite literally) against time begin, you are almost grateful for the opportunity to evade the disturbing questions concerning what's real, what's not, and which one is more dangerous. Dick's misleadingly simple language and the traditionally schematic relationships between his characters, only seem to accentuate the unnatural events he is painting.    Philip Dick is a master of multiple realities that intertwine and overlapp until the mind's ability to grasp it all simply fails, and madness begins. As Paul Di Filippo says in a review of the book, \\"No reality is priveliged\\". Nowhere is Dick's ability to test the limits of perception and self more strikingly demonstrated than in Ubik. And even if you take nothing from the book, but the amazing mystery and suspense filled story, it would still have been one of the most satisfying reading experiences you've ever had.    10/10    [....]
0307346617|5.0|At the risk of sounding ignorant, all other zombie books can suck it. Hard. This book rules.
0743437497|5.0|Like every male with vivid imagination, born after the Seventies, I went through a Stephen King phase in my teens. Luckily, I outgrew that (not before it branded me for life with the nickname you see in the blog's title though), but I'll always have a soft spot for him, and I still read some of his books on occasion.    Reading The Shining was a result of an argument on a message board, about which one is better - the book or the movie. I am a big supporter of the \\"It is a different medium - don't compare!\\" school of thought, but I love an online argument as much as the next guy, so I had to check for myself. And checking for myself, I stumbled upon one of the best Stephen King novels I've ever read.    King's greatest strength as a writer has always been, in my opinion, his depiction of \\"classic\\" American life. The Shining however shows very little of this, as it quickly plunges into the oppressive claustrophobic setting of an isolated mountain hotel. Jack Torrance - an aspiring writer struggling with the lasting effects alcohol has had over his family and his career - accepts a job as a caretaker of the Overlook Hotel in Colorado during the winter months when the building is almost completely unreachable. He moves there with his wife Wendy, and his boy Danny. Although the place has a colorful history, and most of it - unpleasant, Jack feels it nurturing his inspiration to write. However, his son feels differently. Danny has psychic abilities that the hotel chef Dick Hallorann calls \\"shining\\". Dick himself possesses this gift, but not nearly as powerful as the boy. Before he leaves for the winter, he warns Danny to stay away from certain places in the Overlook, since the shining could attract things he may not be prepared to see. Of course, the boy couldn't resist the temptation, and the hotel begins to waken. But its first target isn't the clairvoyant Danny, but his father - Jack.    The Shining is an exceptionally well written thriller, and - as most of King's good books - an in-depth look into the psyche of ordinary people and the demons that possess them. Even though the supernatural element is strong, the true villain in this novel is not the entity inhabiting the Overlook, but the monster hiding in a loving father's weaknesses. The book is large in scope, detailing not just the Torrances' life in the few months of winter isolation, but also parts of the history of the hotel - little chunks of intrigue, happiness and drama, painting a vivid picture of the place. Although nowhere near as grand as It, there are some similarities between the two, especially in the way King beautifully captures a child's view of the world through the eyes of little Danny Torrance and his exploration of the haunting building.    King's style of writing is at its best. Exact and to the point, he doesn't waste time with unnecessary details, and no more than ten pages pass before something disquieting occurs. His ability to ascribe horrific qualities to mundane things like going down a dark staircase, avoiding a fire hose in a corridor, or - indeed - taking a drink, is sharpened to the point of cutting, and the book is filled with moments of chilling tension in situations most of us just pass through without ever thinking twice.    In the end, I enjoyed The Shining tremendously, and when I watched Stanley Kubrick's movie, my expectations were proven correct. There was little in common between the two, and little point to even try and make a comparison. But from this message board argument I was left with a great reading experience of a book I might otherwise have missed. So who says that arguing on the Internet is always like winning the Special Olympics?    9/10    [...]
B001AVCFK6|5.0|This Star Trek movie is pretty impressive. I have never been a fan of the Star Trek series, but I am a huge fan of this movie. Just about everything in this movie is well done. The cast is supurb, the story and the special effects are also amazing. I really liked this Blu-ray, the Picture was what you would expect out of a Blu-ray movie no complaints here. The sound was also done very well I did not have a problem with the voices being too soft to here through my speakers. (I use a sound bar for my system so there are situations where i have to crank up the sound more to hear the dialog better) The rest of the  sound work perfectly, the best sound for this Blu-ray only comes from the TruHD sound.
1597801585|5.0|Paolo Bacigalupi is a relatively new name in the genre, but obviously one to pay close attention to. His debut, The Windup Girl, won first the Nebula for best novel, and then - just a few days ago - the Locus for best debut novel. It is also a finalist for the Hugo, and in my personal opinion fully deserves to win.    The Windup Girl is a \\"biopunk\\" story, set in a world where Global Warming has raised the sea levels and Carbon fuel sources are almost depleted. Biotechnology is the dominant science, and its forerunners are the \\"Calorie Companies\\" - megacorporations that control most of the world through the iron grip of food production. No natural sources of food could survive the engineered plagues and pests that ravage the ecosystem, and only the Calorie Companies have the knowledge and resources to stay ahead of unstoppable mutations, various new strains and their rivals' newest bio-threats. To add insult to injury, most of those threats are deadly to humans as well, and so people live in constant fear of plague and starvation.    The story is set in the city of Bangkok in the Thai Kingdom - one of the last countries thriving without the help of the Calorie Companies whose representatives are forbidden to set foot on its soil. The Thai possess an unimaginable treasure - a seedbank holding specimens of the extinct natural flora - and the megacorporations want to get their hands on this genetic wealth. But the triumvirate running the Kingdom - the Somdet Chaopraya, regent of the Child Queen; General Pracha, head of the Environmental Ministry; and Akkarat, leader of the Trade Ministry - are holding the threats at bay.    Into this tapestry are woven the stories of five characters. Anderson Lake, an agent of one of the Calorie Companies, trying to find a way into the seedbank; Hock Seng, an illegal \\"yellow card\\" immigrant - survivor of the Malaysian purge of the ethnic Chinese - who works as Lake's secretary in the factory he uses for a cover; Jaidee Rojjanasukchai, the \\"Tiger of Bangkok\\", an idealist captain of the White Shirts (the enforcement wing of the Environmental Ministry), who becomes involved in the intrigues between General Pracha and Minister Akkarat; his lieutenant and protegee, Kanya, who is not what she seems to be. And the Windup Girl herself - Emiko - a Japanese \\"New People\\" construct, the product of a race that grows its soldiers, workers, secretaries and geishas in vats. Called \\"Windups\\" because of the tell-tale stutter-stop motions built in their genomes, the New People are the spine of Japanese economy. Bred to be the perfect secretary and companion, Emiko serves her master unquestioningly, her whole being designed to be submissive. But when it turns out that a ticket for her return trip to Japan would cost more than for her master to just buy a new secretary when he gets home, she is abandoned in Bangkok - a place where her very existence is an abomination, where she hasn't even got the right to live, and where her extremely smooth, almost pore-less skin leads to constant overheating. Her condition is exploited by a man named Rileigh, who uses her as entertainment in his brothel.    Their stories intertwine, while building tensions threaten to drown the city in a civil war between the warring factions of the government. Bacigalupi paints a picture of an irreparably damaged world that tries to get back on its feet while malicious forces strive to control the lives of billions with biotechnological monopoly. After the \\"Contraction\\", following the collapse of Western Civilization, the time has come for a new Expansion, and the Calorie Companies would direct it if given the chance. But evolution has taken a new course, and in this ever changing nightmarish reality the only ones who cling to the old order are the humans themselves.    The Windup Girl is a warning environmental tale of what could happen after the depletion of fossil fuels, and where development of bioengineering may lead us. Not all technologiesare overly believable (the kink-springs for example take some disbelief suspending), and most characters give out mixed signals to say the least (when they aren't outright scheming opportunists), but somehow it all works in concert with the magnificent world-building, making Bacigalupi's debut novel a brilliant work of Science Fiction, and one that really deserves all the praise it's been getting.    9/10    [...]
B002VPE1Z2|5.0|I'm becoming a fan of the AmazonBasics line of products - offering sturdy products at a great price.  The Universal Camera Case is no exception.<br /><br />The case is larger than other cases I have used.  However, it has more padding than typical cases.  It fits my compact cameras with ample room for memory cards and batteries.  The extra thick padding makes this a good case for throwing in a carry-on bag, but a bit too large for me to throw in my purse.  I'm obsessed with finding the perfect case for any situation and the AmazonBasics case I like for traveling.<br /><br />Overall, the case feels sturdy and the stitching and fabric appear to be of a relatively high quality.  I recommend this case for people who want to throw their compact camera (or other small electronic item) into a bag and not worry too much about it breaking.
0765350386|5.0|I heard about Brandon Sanderson a few years ago. The reviews were always praising, especially in terms of world-building and magic systems, and being the nerd that I am, those are pretty attractive to me in fantasy. However, when I started reading Elantris, I just couldn't get into it and gave up a hundred pages through. Then I bought Mistborn (or The Fnal Empire, depending on which edition you read) at JFK airport, and immediately loved it.    Reading Brandon Sanderson right now is a little like listening to Muse after the Twilight movies. Sure, he wasn't a nobody before, but he wasn't nearly as famous as he has become in the last two years either. And if you tell anyone you are reading his books now, they'll smirk and say you only do it because of his work on The Wheel of Time. But to me, it was the other way around. I was happy he was the one to finish Robert Jordan's magnum opus because I knew how good he is.    If I have to find a niche in the genre to put Brandon Sanderson in, that would be the same place occupied by David Gemmell (may he rest in peace), the one Raimond Feist vacated when he went the way of Salvatore and Brooks - the road of endless tired sequels, one every three months or so... It is the niche of high fantasy, of adventures and magic, and of characters that would be cardboard in the hands of a lesser author, but who in Sanderson's writing have just enough of that little spark that makes us care for them.    Mistborn is set in a setting that is rarely explored in fantasy. A long time ago, a great threat loomed over the lands, and a hero rose to defeat it. Many united under his banner, and he was the last hope of the world.    He failed.    It is now a thousand years later, and the land is covered by ash, spewed endlessly by active volcanoes. When darkness falls, unnatural mists envelop everything, and strange creatures lurk inside them. This is the time of the Final Empire, held in the iron fist of the Lord Ruler - an immortal god-like being that has controlled humanity for a whole millenium. Under his rule there are only two castes - the nobles, descendants of those that once helped the Lord Ruler ascend to power; and the skaa, slaves belonging to nobility, to do with as they please. Rebellions have been few and far between, and all of them end in total bloody suppression.    But now a new kind of rebel appears. One with the means and will to end the Final Empire once and for all, by striking at its heart - the Lord Ruler himself.    The story centers around the skaa rebellion in Luthadel, capital of the Empire. Even though it is a part of a trilogy, Mistborn  is actually self-contained; the next installments in the series broaden the concept, revealing new layers to the world, previously hidden by the Lord Ruler's reign. And as a stand-alone book, it shines. It has everything a high fantasy needs: intrigues, lurking in the dark, amazingly cinematic fighting sequences... and magic.    Magic in this world is called Allomancy. An Allomancer is a person who ingests little slivers of metal and then \\"burns\\" them in his body, producing a specific effect. There are a number of metals, each working in opposing pairs: one gives you the ability to pull metals, another - to push them; one detects Allomancy, another hides it. This power is extremely rare, and only flows through the blood of some members of nobility, which is the reason for a law that states that any nobleman who takes a skaa lover has to kill her after, to avoid the power being given to the slaves. Of course, this doesn't always happen the way it should, and thus the unlikely cast of characters that shape the events of Mistborn. There are two kinds of Allomancers - those who could burn only one metal are called Mistings. There is, however, an extremely rare number of people, able to burn all metals - the Mistborn.    The magic system is so ordered and used with such precision throughout the book, it resembles more a Science Fiction concept than a Fantasy one. Sanderson obsesses over the interactions between different Allomantic talents, and the result is something that you could imagine so vividly, you almost begin to believe it possible. The action scenes involving Allomancy (that is, nearly all of them) are breathtaking, with people flying, Pulling and Pushing objects to amazing effects.    The story itself is a classic tale of insurrection from within, as the main character Vin - an orphan girl from the street with the powers of a Mistborn - is turned by the rebellion leader Kelsier - also a Mistborn - into a lady from the minor nobility, who he uses to infiltrate the world of the nobles for the purpose of sowing dissent and mistrust. The characters are more or less black and white, although enough nuances exist to make them come to life.    In the end, Mistborn is a greatly satisfying read. It lacks the grand scope of \\"Hard Fantasy\\" authors like Martin, Erikson or Bakker, but it does't need them either. Sanderson has written a thrilling adventure filled to the brim with action, intrigue and one of the most wonderfully developed magic systems I've encountered in the genre. I'd recommend it without reservations.    8/10      [...]
031606792X|1.0|This book absolutely breaks my heart. I seriously think SM had some sort of psychotic breakdown when she wrote this book. It doesn't even seem like it was written by the same author. (Spoiler Alert)    In my world, everything that happened after the wedding does not exist, even though that too was a let down. We don't get to see Bella in her wedding dress very clearly, and she isnt even very descriptive about the decorations that Alice was so excited for Bella to see.     Anyway, I was still happy reading about the wedding, but felt cheated from the moment NOTHING happened during the honeymoon. Makeout scenes in the prior books were more than she gave us on THEIR HONEYMOON??? She could have at least ended the scene with her and Edward in the bed about to go all they way. In fact, ending it at Edward attacking a pillow would have been good. At least then, we would have had some of the passion we were so desperately waiting for, and suspense over what happened to Bella next after Edward almost lost control. Or, she could have written an internal monologue from Bella's POV that described what Bella was feeling during the act without going into gory details..    And um.. VAMPIRES CAN'T HAVE BABIES. End of story there...I don't even want to get into the birthing scene or the heart breaking way she was turned... Her humanity SHOULD have ended with a passionate and emotion filled kiss, and surrender to Edward's bite. This should have been followed by 3 days of torturous agony for Bella, while a pained Edward could do nothing but stand by and watch the love of his existence lose everything he wanted her to keep. Everything that made her pure in his eyes. Now that would have been something..    And Jacob.. wow.. words cannot express my agony for the ending of this character. I was never a team Jacob kind of gal, but I thought SM would at least have the compassion to have him imprint on someone from his world... a Makah perhaps or some other girl from the reservation...someone whom the actual Bella from the 3 previous books would have been happy to see him with...     There is a really good review by Chicklet here. She wrote her own synopsis for the final chapter of the series Twilight fans were wanting to see and it was AWESOME. To me, this is truely how the story ended, and I am going to try really, really hard to forget that SM's version of Breaking Dawn even exists. If Summit were smart, they would use Chicklet's synopsis for the movie, give the fans what they want, and dump the entire storyline from the book, it was such a let down. I felt so cheated reading BD. Yes, alot of dialogue and love scenes from previous books were over the top, but that is what made us girls completely obsessed with the books in the first place. I couldn't beleive she took a love story worthy of Austen's Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth Bennet, at least in my eyes, and destroyed it like that. She completely ruined the entire mythology, and absolute Magic, that she created with the previous books in the series. I can't beleive her publisher actually let her publish this insanity. I feel so cheated.  Please, please, I really really really am hoping the movie is NOTHING AT ALL like the book. NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT. At least then I'll have the hope that I will have the closure I really needed from this series. Most of all though, I am utterly saddened about the absolute wretching and horrific death of what was once a compelling and magical love story that had high prices to pay for love shared against all odds.
0380977273|5.0|Something Wicked This Way Comes was my first contact with Bradbury, and it was a mindblast! The powerful story of archetypes and conviction that has inspired not a few of Steven King's books, and the beautiful and colorful prose of the novel enchanted me in a way that very few authors have ever managed.    The story is set in a small Midwestern town. One October, a mysterious traveling carnival arrives, filled with strange attractions and stranger performers. And as the carnival's dark promises of secret desires turn to madness and despair, the lives of two 13-year old boys change forever.    The beauty of Something Wicked This Way Comes is contained in its contrasts. Will Halloway is born a minute before midnight on October 30. Blond and blue-eyed, he is careful and timid. Jim Nightshade on the other hand - born a minute after midnight on October 31 - is his exact opposite. With his chestnut hair and dark eyes, brooding and always \\"looking at his shadow\\", he is ever getting into trouble. Perhaps it is this duality that accounts for the boys' friendship. It is also another beautiful contrast that Jim's brashness is what makes him the weak one in the story, while Will's timidity hides greater strength.    The monstrous performers of Mr. Dark's carnival are among the most vivid images of nightmarish dementia I've seen in any type of fantasy, not in small part due to Bradbury's amazing descriptions. The scene of the Wax Witch's flight in a balloon held by her breaths, as she touches people's dreams in search for the boys, brands itself deep into the imagination, and won't let go long after you've put the book down. And it is but one example of the powerful imagery that occurs many times throughout the book.    In the end, Something Wicked This Way Comes is a story of growing up and coming of age, of overcoming the greatest obstacles - your own desires and self-doubts - and of finding strength in what makes us human, against a power that would steal your dreams and turnthem to nightmares. The book has mythic resonance, despite its \\"YA\\" setup and small-town setting, and in its wake one feels maybe a little stronger, as if the reader, and not the characters, has overcome the obstacles of Mr. Dark's traveling carnival. It is a beautifully written and imagined novel, and an attestation to the genius of Ray Bradbury's writing. I can not recommend it enough!    10/10      [...]
B003KT3NRA|5.0|I saw Vince Neil live with Motley Crue for the first time; in Knebworth Park last week, and they blew me away. Vince & the boys really do still have it!  This album is hard rock all over. It still has that Motley vibe with some heavy riffs thrown in.

I obtained as many albums as I could from the Black Keys and I must say, I love them all.  This album definitely has a different vibe, but not so much that I would consider it a departure.  Great album from a great band! Buy it and give it a few listens and I would bet it will join your favorite albums of 2010 if not more.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|Like many others, I began with episode one seeing how Joel McHale's comedic performance would fair; I grew up watching him on the local AlmostLive!, not to mention watched The Soup religiously. Admittedly, I wasn't entirely impressed with the show after the first couple episodes, but I stuck it out. It picked up a good deal of momentum very quickly; characters came together, playing nicely off one another, and all adding something to the show. Chevy Chase redeems himself from any and all crappy movies he's done in the last decade; now if Steve Martin could only do the same...Seriously though, an middle-eastern media nerd and black failed jock as best friends, a virginal cutie (and Mad Men star), a Bikini Kill wannabe, a Jesus Freak, and the irony of an Asian man as the Spanish teacher (Senor Chang). What a combo!!
B001GAPC1K|5.0|\\"Iron Man\\" is a great movie.  It is great simply because it provides escapism fun for the length of the movie.  I cannot claim to be a Hollywood movie critic.  I am not going to dissect the acting skills of every actor or the quality of the scenes.    All I can say is this - when a movie is over, if I feel moved because of the message it delivers or, in the case of Iron Man, I am excited about the action, etc., and can't wait to watch it again, then I consider it a great movie!      Iron Man is a great action movie, pure & simple.  If you like things that fly, explosions, etc., all delivered with a Sci-Fi, eccentric billionaire twist, then you'll probably love Iron Man.    The Blu-Ray version is superb....explosions, fighting, etc., all provide excellent audio quality.  The video is very good.    In summary, I think it's classic movie fun....sit back and enjoy it for what it is - a fun ride!

B002WY65W4|4.0|I don't why I am attracted to movies where zombies get killed.  However, if you are someone who enjoys the sound of gun blasts and zombies being splattered by those guns, combined with some respectable humor, then give Zombieland a try.  It's not a great comedy.  It's not a great horror.  It's just somewhere in between.  But, in a sick, fun way, it's enjoyable.<br /><br />SPOILERS BELOW:<br /><br />Maybe this can be classified as a \\"guy movie\\"?  My wife doesn't care for it.  In the movie, the \\"nerd\\" gets the beautiful, tough girl in the end, and they all get to shoot zombies throughout the movie.  For guys who like guns and girls, I guess that's a good mix!  Enjoy!

A crap band releasing crap music. They were bad 7 years ago and they are still bad now. The drummer was a drug addict and did it to himself. What was Mike thinking getting involved with this poser GNR/ Metallica wanna be band. At least go buy the new Annihilator or Exodus instead and let this band and its members go the way of their drummer. Im sure most of you dont even know who any of the above mentioned bands are because when you like good music....you dont listen to crap.

B003LAH7MU|3.0|As my husband pointed out as we listened to this album....if anyone is allowed to redo \\"Roxanne\\" in any way he wants it's Sting. This is a fine piece of work. I only gave it 3 stars because I had the great fortune to see Sting and Orchestra in concert two nights ago. It was the last night of the North American tour. The playlist for the evening was much more extensive than the album. Sting opened with \\"If I Ever Lose My Faith in You.\\"  It was a fantastic opener and set the standard for a great night of wonderful music and arrangements. So only 3 stars because I hope Sting releases more of this music and includes some of the additional songs that were wonderfully performed. For me the album serves as an appetizer to a great feast.  Sting is a lively and engaging performer.  And he is someone who obviously loves music and continues to grow and challenge himself as an artist. The cd is a fair price and I promise you each time you listen you will find something new in each reinterpretation.

If you read any business publications, you already know the latest segment of his journey, specifically with [...].<br /><br />Of course, it helps to be extremely smart (He's a Harvard Grad who took formal education lightly) and have smart friends (He partnered with and hired many of his friends when he grew his businesses). But being a genius is not a hard requirement for success.<br /><br />The main message is that the company culture is the most important thing in business if you are going to try to follow Tony's path. And you need to start building the right culture from Day 1.<br /><br />Tony does things his way, and it has worked for him. People who work for him love him. He treats employees extremely well. He is open and honest and keeps very little about the business a secret.<br /><br />Does everyone have the charisma and smarts to build a culture like Tony has? Probably not. But there are so many lessons in this book, and you can't help but glean some jewels from its pages. For some, it could revolutionize their business.<br /><br />There are also some great web-based supplements you will learn about in the book, so you can keep your company culture buzz going.

1416594787|3.0|Voltaire wrote \\"The best is the enemy of the good.\\"  Dawkins has written a good book, but unfortunately the best book about evolution, the book he should have written is beyond his grasp.      It was 8 years ago that Frank Perry wrote his widely read and praised, Darwin's Blindspot, which pointed to symbiosis as a scientific alternative to Darwin's survival of the fittest evolutionary view of natural selection.  In spite of much evidence that life is based on symbiosis or coevolution between species Dawkins primary response has been to ridicule the ecological point of view, Mt. Improbable, pp. 267-68.  In this book, he ignores the ecological model completely in favor of Darwin's \\"war of nature.\\" p. 400.    Of course we are now facing the most important beological crisis of our time, climate change, which is based solidly on ecological theory.  Of course one would never know this from Dawkins' book.  Darwinian thought is not concerned about climate change, because its concerned only about genes, and extinctions, because these are natural selection's method of perfecting nature.    \\"The best is the enemy of the good.\\"  This is a good book, but not the best book, which is what we really need right now.  Evolution is championed as an expresion of science, but does that justify the distortion of the scientific method by ignoring the evidence that seems clearly to suggest that the Darwinian model of evolution leaves something to be desired.    Dawkins wrote that atheism was not intellectually respectable until Darwin refuted Paley's understanding of evolution-creation.  He is right, but this statement means that he has a vested interest as do many, who agree with him, in Darwin's Theory that goes beyond the available evidence.    For those who are interested in the best, I refer you to my new book[[ASIN:0978970128 DARWIN'S MYTH: Malthus, Ecology, and the Meaning of Life]]

B0006IUDXA|5.0|Macgyver is a great and smart agent who works for the Phoenix Foundation and he also makes strange eventions to get everthing out of his way.Macgyver also travel around the world to stop an evil plot and every episode has a different mission unless they split in to seperate parts.Macgyver has action and so does the first season of Macgyver.This is a great show with Macgyver who doesn't act like 007 or Ethan Hunt because Macgyver doesn't carrie a gun and he could only go into a fist fight or better his strange eventions that maybe distracting,dangerous,or something that will make him get out alive.This is a great show and I highly recommend it and the first season.I watched the first season on netflix on my ps3 and it is now removed so buy it from walmart.The best dvd that is worth a penny.
B001UV4XFG|3.0|I was very disappointed after watching this movie...Don't the Directors even read the novels, before they get out on the set and try to make the book come to life?  This director went for the action and left out the most important part..Bella & Edwards relationship..Everything is cut from the novel that had them in contact with each other..it was still more of a focus on Jacob cause he has a good body..i persume..The slumber parties were left out...most of The Graduation...nothing was told in the novel about The Newborns except speculation...so The Short Life was Bree was put into this movie.with just a bit of Eclipse mixed in and it was horrid...makes me sad that such a magical series which is about 2 peoples relationship..is butchered in a movie...also Krisiten shows no emotion..she is like a statue..she never acts scared or frightened or anything..just stony faced..I did like the toning down of the lipstick as thought it looks ridiculous on men...the fight scene was ok and the flash backs..the scenery was added in most of it and when Jacob the wolf is standing next to Bella..it is so fake looking..the fight between Victoria and Edward was not as in the book..in this movie he was sort of taunting her and Bella stood there jsut staring like \\"Oh well\\" if some vampire was trying to kill me i would be trying to hide or something..and in the book..she did not cut herself..Directors do not think anyone will remember what is in the books..so they jsut take it and change to suit themselves..I guess men liked this movie, as it was fighting..but i feel The Book Bree should not have been the focus of this one and the ending where Bella says \\"she does not want to be a vampire cause of Edward\\" that was soo wrong! all through the books ..she wants to become a vampire to be with him..not cause she fancies the lifestyle...they should sit down and think hard about the last movies Breaking Dawn and try to give us the novel..the magic and maybe add romance to the honeymoon part..asit was hardly there to none in the book..doesn't have to be dirty or nude..but they can make us think they are nude and have more than Bella walking in the water..then that is the end of it all..I hope they do Breaking Dawn right..or it will be frustrating for those of us who have read the books..

0307463745|3.0|I was a bit disappointed with this book.       I listened to the audio version of this book.  I was expecting a book on how infuse innovation into an existing business, not a single point of view perspective on how to run 37 Signals.  This is not a template for small businesses.      What I liked:      1.  Their practices work with their small, highly motivated, well educated work force.  It would be worthwhile for any similar shaped business to determine what can and what should be emulated.    2.  Simplify the product.  Simplify the process.  Think of every tool, software product, etc., where the latest version made the product less useful or totally useless.  I had a Canon AE-1 Program and stop shooting when I upgraded to an A-1.     3.  I liked their attitude towards outside funding.  I've been part of several start-ups and way too much time is spent on getting funded at the expense of building product.         What I didn't like about the book:      1.  The authors appear to short change the business plan.  I get it that the business plan is almost always obsolete by the time its finally sent to the printer.  However, the planning and thought process behind the plan is critical.      2.  The importance of analysis is downplayed.  You shouldn't study a subject to death, but you need to have a pretty well thought out argument for decision making.     37 Solutions is a successful company.  This book is their story about how they function.  They have some great practices that make sense.  However, what worked for them might not work for you.
0525457585|5.0|I strongly recomend this book for recreational reading. The author does an excellent job in creating a whole new world. The characters are suprisingly deep, despite how briefly some of them appear in the story. This book truly is a \\"neverending story\\", in that the writer leaves the story open for other books in many places. Three movies have come about as a result of this work. As always, however the book is much better. Anyone who does not read this book will miss out on a great story!
1423113381|5.0|I've always been a big fan of Egyptian mythology so this book was right up my ally.  This was packed with historical and mythological characters, facts, stories, etc.  It is a YA book but it was very deep and there was a lot of information to remember throughout the entire story.  The characters were well developed and enjoyable to read about which is very important when a story is written in first person.  Overall a really enjoyable read that has me looking forward to the next one in the series.
B000MGBTQ6|5.0|Lifelong baseball fan, and AF brat, every team is my team. Baseball is one of the best movie subjects around and some of the best movies ever made were ABOUT baseball. Major League made Baseball America's list of top ten baseball movies, in some very exalted company. Others on that list are The Natural, Bang the Drum Slowly, Eight Men Out, A League of Their Own, and Bull Durham. Some of the movies that didn't make the cut were nothing less than spectacular. What about Angels in the Outfield, For the Love of the Game, The Final Season, The Rookie, and Soul of the Game? Shall I go on? It would take me a decade to put together my own Top Ten list, but you can bet Major League would be on it. It's hilarious every single time.

Dr. Murphy's words really resonate with my way of thinking and for anyone out there who needs to start living a more happier, healthier, fuller life then you need to read this book. Not just read it but live it. It works, it really really works.<br /><br />For those of you who've only recently read The Secret, this book gives you all the details to make your life the bestest ever, and it was way before The Secret.<br /><br />I particularly likes how he interprets the Bible - makes so much sense the way he puts it to you....<br /><br />And if you can put your hand on any other Dr. Josephy Murphy books do so. Every one is a gem and will definitely bring you lots to think about.<br /><br />Some other favourites of mines are - Techniques in Prayer Therapy and his entire Maximize your Potential series (Hayhouse).<br /><br />Enjoy and here's to a great life !
B00003CXZ4|5.0|Though Memento wasn't Christopher Nolan's very first film, it was his first shot at the big time, as Doodlebug was a 3 minute short and Following was a student film made on a budget of under $6,000. So, you could call Memento a memento of Christopher Nolan's inception as a professional director. It is based on a story that his brother Jonathan wrote about a man who suffers from Anterograde Amnesia--the inability to form new memories after damage to the hippocampus. This character is named Leonard Shelby and he is played by the versatile Australian Actor, Guy Pearce:<br /><br />---------<br />Leonard Shelby: It's just an anonymous room. There's nothing in the drawers. But you look anyway. Nothing except the Gideon bible, which I, of course, read religiously.<br />===============<br /><br />Pearce is really good in this, and though the premise has a built in catch--since he can't remember anything he continuously says the same things and tells the same stories until the people he meets and the audience are both totally fed up--I enjoyed his performance a lot. Leonard is bent on getting revenge on the man who murdered his wife, but his memory problem not only makes this especially difficult--he takes notes, Polaroids, and even has important \\"facts\\" tattooed on himself in a futile attempt to keep track of it all--it also makes us doubt the veracity of his subjective view of reality. Is he really on track to get revenge, or is he being manipulated by others with their own agendas? And if he does get revenge, how will he enjoy that dish--best served cold--if he can't even remember it being served? And even the memories he does have, the ones formed before the accident, how does he know that they are true?<br /><br />Leonard Shelby--and the other characters, too--are all the ultimate Unreliable Narrators. I first heard the term in conjunction with the novel The Good Soldier by Ford Maddox Ford, but if you watch the director's interview in the DVD bonus material, Nolan uses it to describe Leonard. Such elevated concepts and questioning of the very nature of reality are the hallmarks of Nolan's films. He is a rare director who can both toy with philosophy and a big budget, and still fill the seats. An art house director whose films are blockbusters. Memento, while certainly no blockbuster, was at least successful enough to allow him to keep making films. I have not seen Inception yet, but it seems to be doing very well at the box office, while sporting a convoluted and deep plot that once again questions the nature of reality. Both Memento and Inception remind me in a way of The Matrix, and by the way, the other two supporting cast members--Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano--were both in The Matrix as Trinity and Cypher respectively. They are both feeding Shelby stories that may or may not be true. In Memento, who isn't an Unreliable Narrator?<br /><br />The fun of watching Memento is putting together the pieces of the puzzle. It alternates between flashback scenes, which are in black and white, and color scenes that are present time, moving forward. The chronology of this approach is identical to the way F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote The Great Gatsby with each flashback sequence going further and further back in time until at the end the puzzle of Gatsby's greatness is solved. Now that I think of it, Nick Carraway was also a kind of Unreliable Narrator, because the first thing he says is:<br /><br />In my younger and more vulnerable years my father gave me some advice that I've been turning over in my mind ever since.<br /><br />\\"Whenever you feel like criticizing any one,\\" he told me, \\"just remember that all the people in this world haven't had the advantages that you've had.\\"<br /><br />And Carraway then proceeds to use the rest of the book to harshly judge and criticize just about everyone, advantaged or not.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0790734850 L.A.

No doubt about it, Jochum Karajan Haitink, Mehta, Klemperer was great in 4 and 6.Solti as well, Chicago recording is amazing! Mehta conducted my first Bruckner 8th with the New York Philharmonic. 1980. At the Kennedy Center. I've only heard 4,8,9 on this set.  And they give constant enjoyment.  Thank God for Anton Bruckner, and Eugen Jochum. I agree.   Just wonderful.   Conducting students, study hard,  I urge you.   This how it's done.

1934356557|5.0|This book is very unique as far as database design and writing SQL statements. I could be called a 'cookbook' or a 'how-to' book, but its much more than that. The word 'antipatterns' means a way of doing something that is counter-productive in some form or another. So its basically of way to NOT do something. That may seem weird, but if you are aware of ways (patterns) that are ineffective, you will try to avoid those ways and be a more effectve programmer, developer, manager, etc.    There are lots of SQL and Database design books on how to do proper SQL statements but there are very few if any on showing students on what NOT to do with SQL. Its a great way to continue to learn SQL and Database design and advance your skills.     The author does an excellent job in going through all the phases of SQL antipatterns.    1. Rounding errors  2. Phamtom files  3. Index shotgun  4. fear of the unknown  5. random selection  6. spaghetti query  7. sql injection  8. magic beans  9. see no evil  10. ambiguous groups    The names may sound funny, but they are very informative and definitley worth understanding to realy be and efficient database programmer.    A great book and a must buy!
B003ES5JDS|5.0|This is without a doubt my favorite animated movie put out by DC and probably Marvel too.  Being a Marvel fan it was hard to say that but it is true.  Having read the original \\"Red Hood\\" story I can say that I did enjoy the comic but not as much as the movie. (isn't that usually the opposite?)  I really enjoyed the emotion behind \\"the Batman family\\" and speaking of, Neal Patrick Harris was truly inspired as Nightwing.  But I can't go on without mentioning Bruce Greenwood and his perfect portrayal of Batman.  Before this i would have said that Kevin Conroy (Batman in the Animated Series) was the one and only voice for Batman but I think that Bruce really is Batman.<br /><br />The moral dilemmas raised in this show are fascinating to watch and then contemplate after the film is over.  I often times find myself questioning who I should root for.  The animation is crisp and visually striking which is awesome as this movie has some pretty intense action sequences that are sure to thrill the mind.<br /><br />All in all I wish Marvel could turn out animation of this caliber.

B003O85W3A|5.0|Arcade Fire burst onto the scene in 2004 with their debut album, Funeral.  Their grandiose indie anthems earned them glowing praise from critics and fans alike.  With Win Butler leading on vocals and guitar, Arcade Fire's eclectic instrumentation and apparent influences, including David Bowie, Bruce Springsteen, Radiohead, and Neil Young, made them stand out from the countless indie bands getting their start at the same time.<br /><br />Recording their second album in a church, Neon Bible utilized a pipe organ, full orchestra and military choir to expand their sound even further.  Although the mood of Neon Bible was much darker than the soul cleansing shouts of hope that burst through the depression on the surface of Funeral, Arcade Fire proved they were much more than a one off talent.  A packed tour schedule consumed the band's time until early 2008 when the members decided to take a break, playing a few free shows later in the year in support of Barack Obama's presidential candidacy, but ultimately staying out of the public eye.<br /><br />Now, two years later, Arcade Fire is finally back with one of the most anticipated albums of 2010.  Their third record opens with the title track, \\"The Suburbs,\\" which finds Arcade Fire in significantly lighter spirits than their previous two records.  The same band looking for an escape from the pains of life realized in their earlier years is now beginning to accept the conformity of suburbia with a new goal of providing their children with the best experiences life has to offer, safe from the agony they had to work through.<br /><br />There is still, however, an internal conflict hidden within the band's acceptance of The Suburbs.  On \\"Ready To Start,\\" an energetic verse proclaiming \\"I would rather be wrong than live in the shadows of your song\\" shows the classic break-away mindset of Arcade Fire shining through while the following track, \\"Modern Man,\\" brings the pace back down to the mid-tempo groove and finds Win Butler repeating \\"I'm a modern man\\" as if he's trying to convince the listener of something he doesn't quite believe himself yet.  The musical mood swings continue as laid back tracks like \\"Rococo\\" and \\"Wasted Hours\\" are given \\"Empty Room\\" and \\"Month of May,\\" two of the most animated tracks on the album, as neighbors.  Although, on first listen, this pitting of tunes against each other may cause the album to seem sporadic, on further listens, the sheer genius of the track ordering and songwriting as a whole rings out.<br /><br />The apex of the album occurs during \\"Suburban War.\\"  The realization of inevitable maturity begins to be accepted as Butler's earlier cry of \\"I would rather be wrong than live in the shadows of your song\\" becomes \\"I've been living in the shadows of your song.\\"  The truth comes out, denial becomes acceptance and the song's tempo doubles as the line \\"all my old friends, they don't know me now\\" is hauntingly repeated.<br /><br />The Suburbs finds Arcade Fire taking a longing look at the naivety of their youth while looking forward to what the future holds.  Where their first two albums leaned heavily on stand out singles like \\"Wake Up,\\" \\"Rebellion,\\" \\"Keep the Car Running,\\" and \\"Intervention,\\" The Suburbs is much more of a complete work meant to be taken in as a single, hour long journey between adolescence and adulthood.  Longtime fans of Arcade Fire will always hold Funeral on a pedestal, untouchable by future releases, but just as children often grimace at being compared to their parents, The Suburbs is a masterpiece worthy of such an analogy.<br /><br />Similar Artists:  Talking Heads, Pixies<br />Track Suggestion:  \\"Suburban War\\"n\\" as if he's trying to convince the listener of something he doesn't quite believe himself yet.

B003O85W3A|4.0|After waiting for what seems like a millennium since their last official release, we finally get The Suburbs, an engaging indie rock record full of pop gems.  Here's my track by track take on it...<br /><br />The Suburbs - A weak start to an otherwise awesome album, this song was released as the first unofficial single.  When I first heard this song before the album was released, it greatly lowered my expectations. It's terribly repetitive.  (2/10)<br /><br />Ready to Start - This song marks the true beginning of the album, in my mind.  The Strokes-y drum and bass coordination kick-start the song and drive it into one of the most poignant, catchy choruses on the album.  (10/10)<br /><br />Modern Man - I love a good song with a time signature that throws you off then becomes one of your favorites.  (9/10)<br /><br />Rococo - With its chanted tribal chorus, this song brings to mind memories of their debut album, \\"Funeral.\\"  It's a good example of standard, epic Arcade Fire fare.  (8/10)<br /><br />Empty Room - This is my favorite song on the album, without a doubt.  The frenzied strings lead you into the trap and then like the distortion kicks in and knocks you out of your chair.  This reminds me of The Rentals.  (10/10)<br /><br />City With No Children - The Springsteen influence once again becomes apparent.  Thank God they know how to use it.  (8/10)<br /><br />Half Light I & II - The first half is not as amazing as the second, but it serves as a good lead in.  (6/10)/(8/10)<br /><br />Suburban War - I've seen some people make the case that this album is overproduced (mainly due to tracks like this), but I'd have to disagree.  It's well produced, but not overly so.  I think this track a perfect example of the right amount of indie/pop production a great Arcade Fire song requires.  (8/10)<br /><br />Month of May - I'm not in love with this song.  It reminds me of the grungier side of Yo La Tengo, but it sounds like one of their tracks I would skip.  (5/10)<br /><br />Wasted Hours - The vocal melody and lyrics immediately linger in your memory long after hearing this song.  (9/10)<br /><br />Deep Blue - The album starts to get a little sleepy at this point.  During my first listen, it was harder to differentiate the songs toward the end of the album, which made them slightly less memorable.  This song trots along at a blues bar pace but doesn't stay with you for long afterward.  (6/10)<br /><br />We Used to Wait - Things are still a bit worn out as this song plays, but a few interesting elements are introduced into the mix, such as a Modest Mouse-like guitar riff that noodles around in the piano hits.  (7/10)<br /><br />Sprawl I - Perhaps the sleepiest song yet, Sprawl I crawls around but its melancholy melody saves it from being a failure.  (6/10)<br /><br />Sprawl II - The alarm clock finally went off.  This could easily be the next single.  The catchy 80's all-girl vocals are infectious.

During my first listen, it was harder to differentiate the songs toward the end of the album, which made them slightly less memorable.  This song trots along at a blues bar pace but doesn't stay with you for long afterward.  (6/10)    We Used to Wait - Things are still a bit worn out as this song plays, but a few interesting elements are introduced into the mix, such as a Modest Mouse-like guitar riff that noodles around in the piano hits.

B00275EHJG|5.0|I remember seeing the original Toy Story when I was just 9 years old when life was so much simpler and the adventure of Toy Story provided some welcome entertainment. 15 years later and we now have Toy Story 3; life is a lot more complicated, but Toy Story 3 isn't just casual entertainment, it becomes a welcome escapism reminiscent of a childhood long gone. There was no doubt whatsoever that this film would be a success as the franchise had built up quite a following. Every adults inner child would have been screaming incessantly as soon as it heard the announcement that there would be a third Toy Story. I know I was excited from the moment I saw the teaser for the film and wanted to know more and more every day as to where they would take the story next.<br /><br />Andy (John Morris) is now 17 years old and preparing to go to college. Almost all Andy's old toys have already been either thrown away in the trash or donated, all the toys that are left are Buzz (Tim Allen), Woody (Tom Hanks), Jessie (Joan Cusack), Bullseye, Slinky Dog (Blake Clark), Mr & Mrs. Potato Head (Don Rickles & Estelle Harris), Hamm (John Ratzenberger), Rex (Wallace Shawn) and the Green Aliens (Jeff Pidgeon). They are worried about what will happen to them when Andy goes to college, will they be thrown in the trash, left in the attic or will Andy take them with him. The third option being the most unlikely. When Andy is packing his stuff, the toys find themselves ending up in Sunnyside day care centre, which seems like heaven to them all. Run by Lotso (Ned Beaty), what seems to be a heaven for toys turns out to be somewhat of a hell for the old gang and they have to find a way back home before Andy goes to college.<br /><br />I'm a massive fan of the original movies as these are something I've literally grown up with. The bits of adult type humour I didn't really get when I watched the films when I was younger, I enjoy watching again and getting new and more fruitful laughs. Toy Story 2 was shown on TV a few weeks ago and it was a genuine pleasure to watch something I had not watched for a number of years and still managing to be able to enjoy the humour and the message to pass onto the kids about friendship and loyalty. The message was strong then, and it's good to know that the message hasn't been lost in the 11 year gap leading to Toy Story 3, and is actually even stronger. The characters that were left are tied together, stronger than ever by the fact that it's only them left and they do not want to be split up, but in fact if they can't stay with Andy, they want a new home where they will be played with every day.<br /><br />The animation has seen a significant upgrade in almost every department. Lee Unkrich has commented that when approaching the animation for this movie, the makers have not approached it in the mind that it must look the same as the last two instalments. They animators approached it with the mind of making Toy Story 3 look how they would have wanted the originals to look, had the technology been as advanced as it is now. There's definitely an upgrade in look and feel of the characters and the atmosphere of the whole thing, especially with the human characters as it makes their story a lot more believable, and allows the viewer to invest more emotion into the story.<br /><br />The characters both new and old are excellent and create some hilarious moments. Possibly the best addition to the Toy Story cast was Barbie's male counterpart, Ken who's as camp and image obsessed as you would possibly imagine him to be. Lotso, the villain of the film was quite the typical villain you would expect. A mob boss of sorts in the setting of the day care centre, he's a toy that was lost and replaced as a youngster who feels bitter and angry towards the humans and the toys that play with them. Although I understood why Lotso was the character he was, I never really understood why he was so hell bent on keeping the toys locked up in the day care centre. Perhaps that was just a negative symptom of me not paying much attention to that part of the story.<br /><br />Overall, however, the film was truly splendid from start to finish. The characters were both as enjoyable and lovable as I remember them and it contained some truly hearty laughs, my personal favourite was the Spanish Buzz Lightyear trying to win Jessie's heart. I would highly recommend this to anyone still in touch with their inner child, or someone looking to introduce these characters to a new generation as it's promising entertainment for the entire family.tive symptom of me not paying much attention to that part of the story.

B00004THAY|5.0|The King truly rides again in this CD.  This CD show how Eric Clapton loves the blues that gave him is foundation in music.  They both do an excellent job with the music.  May they both continue to produce great music for all to listen to.
B00005BIIP|4.0|I don't own it yet, but I know all the songs. It's the usual Porcupine Tree quality, no surprises. What's important is that this CD is being re-issued in Sept 2010 at a realistic price ($16) from the band's website, and I'm sure Amazon will have it shortly after. I can't justify spending $40-70 on one CD. It will be a straight re-issue, exact same material and packaging as previous edition, no bonus anything.
B000E1JOSE|4.0|If you like Roy Oribson, this is the CD for you.  All of his hits played by him and some of the most renowned musicians in the world.  This is by far the best recording of Orbison's hits.  This is a great CD to add to anyone's collection.
B000JPIB8Y|3.0|I'll mention from the get-go that this is strictly my reaction to the book, not a detailed review with plot summary and such.  There are plenty of those to choose from.    !!!!!!POTENTIAL SPOILERS AHEAD; you've been warned!!!!!!    The Lovely Bones is an entertaining read, but ultimately unfulfilling.  In my opinion, this is for several reasons:    1)  The search for Suzie's killer, Mr. Harvey, is treated as a secondary plot device and eventually discarded altogether by the author.  Suzie's father and sister seem dedicated to finding her killer and bringing him to justice but, unfortunately, her mother, the police, and even Suzie herself don't seem to care.  The first half of the book plays like a mystery novel where characters find clue after clue and inch ever closer to finding the killer, but as soon as suspicion is thrown on him he is allowed to skip town and get away.    2)  Suzie's heaven is not very heavenly.  Sure, she can conjure anything she wants, watch people on earth, even read their minds.  However, searching for answers and seeking justice are forbidden.  You're just supposed to play all day, spy on people, keep your mouth shut, and move on.  I guess it is a bit like the modern religious concept of heaven after all.  I've seen way too many sci-fi shows where the character(s) is trapped in an inviting glamorous paradise that's really designed to keep them from asking questions.  It's all eventually revealed to be a kind of prison cloaked in intricate, superficial illusion.    3)  The ending was ridiculous.  Suzie is given temporary possession of her living friend's body, but does she do anything useful with her new time one earth?  No. She just meets up with her crush from junior high (whom she kissed ONCE), takes him to a deserted bike shop and has sex with him!  You'd think it would have occurred to her during this time to mention that her body was lying inside a metal safe down the sinkhole RIGHT ACROSS THE ROAD!  This would have given some closureto both her family and to the reader.    Maybe the point of the book was that closure is not always possible....but if you bother throwing in elements like heaven and bodily possession (FFS!) and then don't deliver anything, it seems cheap rather than realistic.    I don't know the religious leanings of Alice Sebold, but there is definitely a naïve, liberal, christian vibe I got from the book.  The impression I got was something like: \\"Don't worry about searching for answers when something bad happens.  It isn't our place to find justice.  Don't worry, those who do evil deeds will get what's coming to them eventually.  Move on.  Be happy.\\"  In the case of the killer, Mr. Harvey, he did get what was coming to him.  However, this was more than 8 years after Suzie's murder.  The book already established him as a serial rapist and murderer.  How many other girls suffered and died before he got his \\"final justice\\"?    In the end, I guess it's the unsatisfactory resolution to the book that was the worst offender for me.  I can handle not catching the killer, but don't tease me over and over then not deliver.
B000UE29SW|1.0|This book could have used some serious editing. It's poorly written and doesn't convey very much. It doesn't even begin to touch THE MESSAGE by Lance Richardson, which is far superior and much easier to believe. Betty Eadie claims to have seen and interacted with Jesus Christ, going so far as to gently scold the Master. She doesn't go beyond what anyone could get out of an LDS theological manual. She also was asked once in an interview about the brisk sales of her book and I got the feeling it was going into her own coffers. To think that someone could have an experience like this and then sell it for profit doesn't settle well with me. It's a sacred experience and if published should be given freely, not sold. I can't judge the woman. Maybe she's telling the truth, maybe not. But she's not telling me anything that can't be gleaned from many, better accounts. Based on my own view, this sounds as though the author read other accounts and simply wrote her own. Again, I could be wrong, but this is my take. Read Richardson's THE MESSAGE and stick with that one. Although I've never met Richardson, I have friends and family who have, and they assure me his credibility is rock solid. Eadie's may be rock solid, too, but many readers, including myself, don't want to see someone treating Christ so casually in their stories. Indeed, does Christ have the time to appear personally to everyone who has an afterlife experience? Eadie's book is vague in its descriptions. It begins with her seeing three \\"monks\\" whom she said she knew before she was born into mortality. She chats with them telepathically a few moments, then races home to check on her family. The kids are having a pillowfight and her husband is reading the paper. This sounds a bit stereotypical in itself. They're pillow fighting while mom is at the hospital fighting for her life. Now she has no desire to speak to them, but instead races back to the hospital where the three monks are still waiting for her. They do little for the story and are mere props, having no real purpose or contributions to the story. And it goes on from there. Everyone tends to be rather faceless, and the story quickly bogs down. This shouldn't happen in such a short book. Had I been ghostwriting it for her, I would ask, \\"What were their names? What did you talk about? What did they say? When you got to the spirit world, what did the ground look like, the sky, the vegetation?\\" Another thing that bothered me is that the \\"monks\\" were emanating a brownish light. Most people who see the spirit world report that everyone is emblazoned with white light -- light that is extremely bright, but which doesn't hurt the eyes. I feel uneasy with these beings, which wear brown and appear, as I said, as props, with no substantial purpose. They just take up space, and are nameless, faceless entities.

B0006GAI82|5.0|Now were at my favorite Die Hard. Die Hard With A Vengeance I know it's wrong to like this over the 1st but this was the 1st 1 I saw around 1995 or 1996. John McTiernan directs I'm glad cause he brings fun over the top action & brilliance to the movie. Bruce Wills reprises his role were also introduced to Zues played by Samuel L Jackson. Simon the films villain is played by the underrated Jermy Irons. It's now 5 years after Die Hard 2 John Mclane is back as a New York City cop & is seperated with Holly. So movie starts off a bomb goes off  & Major Case Unit gets a call by a man named Simon he wants to play his version of \\"Simon says\\"  with John Mclane  who is now a borderline terminal alcoholic & is on suspension from the department. I like The Mclane character in this movie 1. he's p!$$æd off. 2. He has 1 h**l of a hangover. He has to go to Harlem & wear this sign that say uh well you know. He meets Zues & they have to work together & it becomes a wild ride of fun action scenes & brilliance. While John is talking to the FBI he finds out that Simon is Hans brother Simon Gruber. Simon sends the cops on a wild goose chase with a bomb to trick the cops so he can steal gold from The Federal Reserve. That's pretty much the outline for the plot. Die Hard With A Vengeance has 2 endings the theatrical & the 1 on the special edition which I saw the FX  version & the Pay Per View airings in early 96. I figure they shot the theatrical last. The alternate ending is the police think John involved in the heist & is thrown off the force John goes to Europe finds Simon & they play Russian roulette with some kind of Rocket launcher. During the Pay Per View airings they used more footage. Cool facts was the script was originally called Simon says then it became Leathal Weapon 4 then it was rewritten as Die Hard 3. John McTiernan considered pushing the release date back cause of the OKC bombing. Sean Connery was the 1st choice to play Simon. The 1st choice for Zues was Laurance Fishburne. 1 script had it on a boat which later became the script for Speed 2. Ok I'm happy that they went with the theatrical ending cause the alternate 1 I feel is like a if a fv** you to the fans.

B001NLKWLW|3.0|This is the first book I have read by this author and I chose it based on all of the good reviews posted here. I love historical fiction (it's pretty much all I read for fun in fact), but I just wasn't blown away by this novel. Maybe I had expectations that were too high after reading all of the positive things people had to say, but I just found it to be ok. Mostly, I found it frustrating, like it was overwritten somehow...in many places you sensed you were getting to the meat of the story, only to be switched to another character who didn't reveal what you were looking for (or who turned up another loose end!). This book tied together in the end, but when I had read it about 60% (sorry I have the kindle version), I figured out what was going to happen and then felt like I was just reading along waiting for the main character to finally figure it out too. Overall, I would say this book was a decent read, seemed to be well researched, and enjoyable.

Esther is an interesting character and I like how Plath uses language -- this novel and her poetry both have an unconventional beauty about them.

Many business books speak about how you need a business plan, funding, and saving at least 6 months of income. Re-work is just the opposite and breaks all the rules. It just makes sense. If you're going to start a business or planing to, you should definitely read this book.     In one of the chapters it speaks about how prison guards make knifes out of plastic forks to shank people, not that you're going to shank someone. The point is they have nothing and create things out of plastic forks. It's amazing what you can do when you have a little motivation!     Ciao'    - masnaco -
0784011710|5.0|Sophie's Choice is by far one of the very best films I've ever seen. This period piece was done with the greatest of care--we get excellent, convincing acting; a fine script; outstanding choreography and cinematography; character development and more. The plot moves along at a good pace and although the movie runs two and one-half hours I was never once bored--these characters drew me in; the story grabbed me by the throat and never let me go until the very final frame of the picture. In addition, the recurring theme of life as opposed to death runs through the picture to make this film most powerful indeed.<br /><br />When the action starts in 1947, we meet young 22 year-old Stingo (Peter MacNicol) who has moved to Brooklyn, New York from the South to become a full fledged writer; he has high hopes for his future. Naturally, he finds Brooklyn to be rather different than the Deep South but he quickly makes friends with Sophie (Meryl Streep), a beautiful Polish &eacute;migr&eacute; and her rather unstable lover, Nathan (Kevin Kline); they share an apartment in the same boarding house that Stingo moves into. Stingo becomes fast friends with Sophie and Nathan although he is bothered by Nathan's incredible outbursts of anger and violence that sometimes result in Sophie being physically harmed.<br /><br />It is through Stingo's eyes that we get to know Nathan as well as Sophie's disturbing and complicated past. Sophie tells Stingo that her father and husband were killed by the Nazis at the onset of World War Two; and Sophie makes it clear that she agreed with her father when it came to his hatred of the Nazis about which he lectured at the University in Poland where he taught. However, halfway through the film Stingo learns that Sophie has not exactly been telling him the truth and that Nathan is also hiding the truth--and the disappointed Stingo almost leaves to return to the South especially as his funds are running low and he hasn't sold his book yet.<br /><br />Sophie convinces Stingo to stay; and we see even more of the tumultuous relationship between Sophie and Nathan--as well as a new explanation of her past to Stingo. As the plot unfolds, Stingo, Sophie and Nathan become all the more close--and Stingo has an encounter with Nathan's brother Larry (Stephen D. Newman) that is also quite shocking.<br /><br />Actually, I haven't given away as much of the plot as it may seem; you will understand that when you see this film. I won't give away more of the plot either; but suffice it to say that the devastating, demoralizing choice that Sophie had to make will haunt you for quite some while to come; it's one of the most powerful scenes I've ever watched in any movie.<br /><br />Other actors performed very well in this film; Greta Turken did a great job as Leslie Lapidus and G&uuml;nther Maria Halmer brilliantly portrays Rudolf Hoess, the actual Nazi Commandant at Auschwitz and the only person in this film who actually existed. Marvin Hamlisch's original music for the film adds even more to the quality of the picture.<br /><br />The DVD comes with an interesting documentary (\\"Death Dreams at Mourning\\") that includes actors Kevin Kline, Meryl Streep and Peter MacNicol as well as Marvin Hamlisch; and we get the theatrical trailer. There are production notes and brief comments on still screens about the principle actors in the film.<br /><br />Sophie's Choice easily stands the test of time; the film is every bit as powerful now as it was when it was first released because of the nature of the story as it relates to the horrors of World War Two. True, it's certainly not for the squeamish; but this poignant tale is so remarkable and so well done that it should be in every film buff's collection.see even more of the tumultuous relationship between Sophie and Nathan--as well as a new explanation of her past to Stingo.

I watched the movie \\"Serenity\\", and someone mentioned that it had been the final chapter in a series.  Found this on Amazon and loved it.  It literally has something for everyone.  I see the crap that runs for years on TV and I can't put into words my amazement that this show was cancelled so soon; whereas \\"Big Brother\\" and other such garbage continues on.  THE \\"FIRERLY\\" SERIES IS WORTH TWICE THE PRICE...but be prepared, you're gonna be dissapointed when it's over; you're gonna want more.  Sorry.  Get the movie \\"Serenity\\" to finish the series.

0143118420|1.0|I have been wanting to read this book ever since I saw that it was being made into a major motion picture starring Julia Roberts of all people.  UGH... talk about BOOOORRRING.  She is self-absorbed to the point where I was rolling my eyes so much while reading I was wondering if my eyeballs were going to get stuck that way.  I stopped reading it about halfway through.  I really don't CARE about her and her uninteresting travels and you can bet your booty I sure as hell am not wasting my good hard earned money to see the movie either.  To sum it up... don't even bother.
0142004413|4.0|Gerald Durrell originally intended this book to be primarily about the flora and fauna of Corfu, the island off the northwestern Greece mainland to which his family moved from England when he was a child.  As it turned out, however, this delightfully entertaining series of mishaps includes a great deal of local color, including rather interesting (read \\"wacky\\") Corfian characters and experiences.  A great believer in \\"You Are There\\" reading, I timed my own to coincide with a trip to Corfu in late May, where I finished the book at a villa set among olive trees above a stunning little bay overlooking the Ionian Sea on Corfu.  Absolutely delightful!  By the way, this is a wonderful book to share by reading aloud.
B002JVWR9U|4.0|I watched the first couple of episodes and slowly lost interest because it was very high school and I became quite annoyed with some of the supporting characters.    I picked it up again because I was curious about what happened and after getting past all the high school drama it became a surprisingly good show. The story and action of it all really took off and made each episode exciting and less about teenagers in love. I wouldn't say it's the best show ever, but it's still a catch. I would recommend it to people but they might have difficulty getting past the first 8 episodes.

B0021L8V0M|4.0|One thing you can count on: When Angelina Jolie does an action movie, you know you're going to get action and plenty of it.  The action in \\"Salt\\" is so non-stop, so relentless, so slam-bang-in-your-face, that the film moves at warp speed and it's over almost before you realize it.  That the plot is patently ridiculous somehow doesn't seem to matter very much.  This movie is meant to be pure fun, and on that score, it delivers.<br /><br />Jolie plays Evelyn Salt (it's interesting that this role was originally written for a male actor, but Jolie proves she is more than able to handle it), a CIA operative married to a German scientist who specializes in all kinds of deadly spiders, who managed to get her out of a North Korean prison where she is being gruesomely tortured as the film opens.  But it turns out she may or may not be a Russian sleeper agent who is scheduled to go into action as soon as some very nasty stuff hits the fan; specifically, the assassinations of both the Russian and American presidents, and the detonation of a nuclear bomb or two.<br /><br />Salt's cover is blown (maybe) and she protests she was set up, but since nobody believes her, she's off and running in some really exciting chase sequences.  Jolie actually did some of her own stunts in this movie, although not the more dangerous ones such as jumping from the top of one speeding truck to another.  The real fun in this film comes from the fact that we can't really tell who Salt is.  Is she an American agent, or Russian, or Russian pretending to be American, or American pretending to be Russian?  By the end of the film we still don't know, but we know one thing: the way this film ends, a sequel is probably already on the storyboards.<br /><br />All of the actors give creditable performances, but Jolie's performance is what really makes you want to see this film more than once.  Tabloid gossip aside, she's a damn good actress, and she totally throws herself into this movie, literally and figuratively.  Tune in next summer (hopefully) for the next exciting episode.<br /><br />UPDATE 4/4/11:<br /><br />I just watched the DVD with all three versions of the film (theatrical release, director's cut and extended cut), and am wondering why in the world didn't the studio release the extended cut in the theaters?  It's a totally different ending, which I'm darned if I'm giving away, except to say that it's much more satisfying and makes for a vastly better movie overall.<br /><br />You can choose your version simply by going to the DVD menu, click on Play Movie, and then select whichever of the three you want.

B00062IVKS|3.0|robert deniro is my number 2 favorite actor.(clint eastwood the 1st) i was very dissapointed in this film because of the quality of the sounds and conversations. the first time i watched it i could not even make out most of what was being said. the second time i watched it with subtitles and this time it was much better. the accents of the characters was very hard for me to follow. the great part of the movie was visually. the fight scenes were great. i honestly believed deniro was boxing for real. the editing was flawless. i don't know for sure if he won an oscar for this movie, but if he did not he deserved it!
B002ZG9846|3.0|Does anyone understand the thinking behind these combo packs? I have a Blu-Ray player and so I have no use for the DVD version. And the person buying this for the DVD version can't play the Blu-Ray disc. I mean how stupid is this?     Please, guys, cut the crap and give each person the version they will use. Maybe if you do that you can drop the price a couple of bucks and sell way more copies. I can't imagine having just a regular DVD player and having to pony up the bucks to cover a Blu-Ray disc that's included that I can't even play.    Jeez get a freakin' clue.    The movie, by the way, gets 4.5 stars. I'm minusing 1.5 stars for the idiotic packaging scam.
9889979942|5.0|Far removed from cliché, China: Portrait of a People is an unbiased look at the real China in all its diversity: no artificial syntax, no deliberate panegyric. Carter, not a professional photographer, is able through photographic art to display the human reality of China with its myriad multiplicity.   The compelling photographs while technically excellent are significant in that they are not deliberate, not photoshopped, and capture candid, unposed people in spontaneous moments of time. As such, China: Portrait of a People affords a rare view of the contemporary realism of China.  The photographs give visual form to the way in which the usefulness of the pastoral and the power of the urban industry have impacted upon individual people. The contrast between the carefree optimism of everyday farmers and well-heeled urbanites of the big cities is a microcosm of the diversity of China and her people.  The 800 plus photos throughout the 600 plus pages do indeed illustrate the real China. Carter without political occasion or agenda left the tourist track well and truly behind to document people both in cities and in remote and hard-access areas, visiting China's 56 ethnic groups in 33 provinces. That he did so on foot and over two years is apparent in the in-depth portrayal of human realities.  China: Portrait of a People is a comprehensive study which has not in any way been disinfected. Images of beggars and the poverty-stricken are shown in all their veracity alongside images of the resplendent Zhaung, Bai and Yao minorities in lush mountain regions. The reader sees what Carter sees. You will encounter the nomadic Drokpas of Tibet, the brilliantly adorned and elusive Akha people who surface only on market days, the lively Muslim Uyghurs of Xinjiang in the distant northwest, and the 35,000 miles in between.  Although China: Portrait of a People focuses on people - not surprisingly given the title - architecture is seen in juxtaposition: the traditional rooflines of Tibet's prosperous city, Shigatse, the traditional seat of the Panchen Lama, the equally traditional Old Town of Lijiang, Yunnan, built in the late Song Dynasty and the early Yuan Dynasty, the Hakka walled villages in Fujian, the contemporary cities of Shanghai and Shenzhen.  We see also dramatic landscapes - the Bamboo Sea in the southern Sichuan Province, the Dragon's Spine Terraces which are the Longji Titian rice fields, the other-worldly mountains reminiscent of Avatar's Pandora.  China: Portrait of a People surely has enormous anthropological value but to the tourist, Chinaphile, coffee table book reader, travel or photography enthusiast, this book is a must-have.
B0026OE2NY|5.0|Stunning aerial photography in the service of delivering one hell of a chilling message. One can't argue with the visual evidence of the dire circumstances we are finding ourselves in these days. \\"Ask not for whom the bell tolls ...\\" kinda thing. SO RELIEVED, however, the film provides visages of the SOLUTIONS. I would have liked to see more footage spent in this enterprise (i.e., 'salvation/redemption'), but still came away somewhat more hopeful than I expected to. I, too, happened to notice the discrepancy about the \\"first cities appeared 600 years ago\\" snippet, but figured some other qualifier was left out of the commentary? Another thing that threw me off, towards the end, was Glenn's \\"I\\" statements. Was she speaking for the director? Or was Glenn personally involved in the creation of this documentary? Not clear. In any case, not willing to \\"throw the baby out with the bathwater.\\" Figuring, every man, woman, and child on earth should be required to watch this film as a prerequisite for \\"earth citizenship,\\" and that the movies be financed by the \\"2% of the population holding all the material wealth of the planet\\" ... you think?!
0471463396|5.0|Very clear writing.  Attends all kind of experienced readers.  The first part explains you about the theories and then takes you to the practice through skilled investor's experience.  Definitely a must read for those that want to grow in the market.
B000UVV2DS|4.0|A lot of planning, rehearsing, and effort went into this production so I dont care for the negative reviews much. Its a rock band with an orchestra so DUH! YES there is extensive symphonic organization to this vid. I loved em.<br />The direction is excellent as is the sound quality, and a stunningly BEAUTIFUL woman does a vocal solo that left me breathless. She returns to assist in some back-up vocals also.<br />Morse, Paice, Glover and Lord are as always flawless. Gillan I'm afraid still thinks he has a voice but his screeching out like a barn owl in heat is getting old. Thats what 40 years of wailing does to you.<br />Buy it anyway.
B003S897U0|5.0|I'm not going to get into a track by track review, but i'm just gonna say that this is special..I love the stripped down versions of these songs..My only complaint would be that the Crowes didn't put anything from the \\"By Your Side\\" cd which is my favorite cd from the Crowes..I would have loved to hear some stripped down tunes from that cd..GREAT BUY!!
B000BKJ6WW|1.0|I ordered this from DEAL-DUDE and thought it was a DVD but its isnt. It goes in some kind of game console platform or whatever so I could not use it. Nice of them to tell me, eh?<br />I returned it to DEAL-DUDE for a refund a long time ago but that never came, and my frequent requests for store credit to exchange for something else have gone ignored. But hey, DEAL-DUDE got their product back! [and kept my money].<br />I dont recommend the product nor the vendor. You'll lose on both ends.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|I bought this movie as a birthday gift for my daughter, who had also read the book. She absolutely LOVED it, so I would highly recommend it if you have anyone in your family that likes this kind of movie. And I love how Amazon compares prices/vendors so that you can get the best deal for the money!
0143118420|4.0|this book was really quite great. although there are some parts that are less easy to follow, the author puts a great deal of emotion and research behind each of her words. not only do i find the book to be very inspirational but along the way there's no chance of not learn a great deal about eastern culture and religion. for those that say that elizabeth is self centered - yeah obviously she is; she's writing a biography of a short yet meaningful time of her life, how could the book not sound self centered? and for someone to go out and decide to change their life so drastically against all opposition is quite a tremendous thing for someone to do. she's blessed to have gotten to go on such an unforgettable adventure and people should be happy for such a personal achievement shared to the world instead of tearing it down with criticism and observation. have you ever attempted rebuilt your life and start over?
B003MC5N28|5.0|This is a fantastic book. I first read this in elementary school, before it was famous. This is a great pick for young readers, but teens and adults will be challenged accordingly. Step into the parallel universe of the creative mind of Lois Lowery and expect greaness.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Those who left negative reviews of LOST were focused on the mysteries of the island, and that is not what the show was about.  The show is about the characters, and their lives on and off the island.  Why else would half of each episode feature a specific character?  But if you look back to episode one, you'll notice there was no Dharma, no Linus, no Desmond, no Widmore, no hatches, and only a cameo by Mr. Smokey and a soon-dead polar bear.  If you look back at that episode, that's what pulled you in!  And each of those questions got resolved. and with an insane amount of detail, too.  Now, it would have been nice to know why Walt so damn important in season two, or how Jacob's mother washed up on the island in season 6, but guessing is half the fun in LOST. And the producers were geniuses in this, because this will inspire fan debates, among other things. If they had answered all of the questions, nobody would still be talking about it.    In the end, if you care more about the amazing characters than the mysteries in this show, then pick up LOST, you won't be dissapoionted.
0307594777|5.0|An amazing trilogy that you can't put down.  We have lost a true talent with Larson's death.
B0029LHW68|2.0|This album is BORING.  The only reason this album will sell ANY copies is \\"Kings and Queens\\" and \\"This Is War.\\"  I almost feel tricked into buying the album after hearing those 2 songs.  HUGELY disappointed with this album.  I remember listening to it for about an hour and not having a single song catch my attention as i was driving.
1439153663|5.0|This is a very engrossing historical novel.  Interesting subject and very well written.  Suspensful and emotional--I could'nt put it down!
B001CEE1YE|5.0|Excellent quality. After seeing these 3 movies in Blu-ray it is like seeing a whole new film. Great stuff.
B003LAH7MU|4.0|I love artists covering each other and when they cover themselves with a different style, eg \\"Unplugged.\\" Peter Gabriel just did a similar thing--all covers with not any drums or guitars on board. Naturally, I really enjoyed this set by Sting & the Royal band.  Bought it two weeks after seeing him live in St. Louis, which was an awesome show, and which made the CD a re-living of it.  I really liked the song selection, with some new \\"old\\" stuff, and also the different interpretations. Symphonic music is not for all, but I love the fusion that Sting and the Royal Philharmonic pulled off.  I enjoyed some of my less favorite Stings songs even more.  Learned some lyrics, too.  The real reason I am posting a note is this:  to respond to those who call this elevator music and who complain that Sting is just recylcing, not creating new music.  First, like I said, symphonic music isn't for everyone, especially the head-banging crowd.  Second, belly-aching about the CD not having new music is like complaining that a hamburger doesn't taste like hotdog.  The CD was what it purported to be--a collection of Sting's work with symphonic support.  Once one wraps one's mind around that puzzler, the work should be judged on its merits, not on what it's not and never intended to be.
B001G8XON0|5.0|Loved this movie!  Loved the music, the singing, the colors!  This movie made me laugh and made me cry.  I can watch it back to back (like what cable TV does) and still enjoy it every single time!
B000UR9T82|4.0|The entire Spiderman trilogy is so good (particularly the first two) not because of its fantastic FX, made even more marvelous ;-) in HD, not because of great acting that, with intuitive genius, includes over-the-top performances by limited, key actors (editor, villains), combined with over-the-top powers and toys of the villains to link-in the comic-book (alright, graphic novelette) genre's mood, while keeping the performances of Parker and his personal circle on an emotional, earthly level, but the three movies are sooo good because the story is written so well, with the priority on character, character, character, and the love story, as stated in the first movie's opening monologue, and held true throughout.<br /><br />Peter Parker's (Toby Maguire) trials with his family, friend, Harry (James Franco) and love-interest, MJ (Kirsten Dunst), are such that the audience is so drawn into the interactions and outcomes, including the strong, inner struggle Parker has with his super-hero alter-ego, that the FX, stunts, toys, and even the conflict with the villains (who are also excellently flushed out and played, with dual, warmly human and wholly evil sides)  is a secondary aspect that provides, more than anything else, pace and excitement to accent the real story that moves with the slower pace a plot moved by character demands.  This is what good writing, the most important component of any story, in any media, is all about, and with all three Spiderman movies, the good writing prevails, opposite to so many or almost all movies of the genre which make the FX and the combat of villain and hero the centerpiece and wraps a plot, if a story, around that, resulting in another Hollywood failure added to the heap of such two-star-and-less failures.<br /><br />Great casting also contributes to the effectiveness of character development and the story.  The more common, physical attributes of the two leads helps keep their lives down to earth, contributing to an aurora of believability that the viewer can buy into, which would have been greatly diminished if the producers would have filled the role of Parker with a Twilight-James-Dean incarnation (like James Franco, who plays Harry, Parker's friend) and MJ with a compatibly stunning beauty.  And the villains' characters are excellently brought to life by Willem Dafoe, Alfred Molina, and Thomas Haden Church.<br /><br />The three movies of the first-generation Spiderman are all anyone could hope for, except to hope that the new generation will be produced with care that the same values making the first generation a stand-out will be in the fore of the minds of the writers, producers, and director.viewer can buy into, which would have been greatly diminished if the producers would have filled the role of Parker with a Twilight-James-Dean incarnation (like James Franco, who plays Harry, Parker's friend) and MJ with a compatibly stunning beauty.

B003S897U0|5.0|Once again the Black Crowes have outdone themseleves.     We are looking at a 20 song, greatest hits album which comprises of 19 songs culminating from the first 6 albums and one cover (She by Graham Parsons). Every song has been recorded live and acousic. I got my copy on Friday and haven't put it down since. The versions of \\"Thorn In My Pride\\" & \\"Downtown Money Waster\\" are ridiculous! Including \\"Share The Ride\\" & \\"Morning Song\\" are 2 songs that are completely different from the original version, but are totally awesome. Not a bad song on the album.    I've seen the Crowes 4 times in the last 3 years, and will again when they hit Philly in October. Since adding Luther & Adam, the Black Crowes have just gotten better. The only negative is the long hiatis promised after the tour. I completely understand though...after 3 albums, 2 DVD's and basically non-stop touring over the last 4 years, I'd be pretty darn tired. These boys have earned the right to take a break and enjoy some of that hard earned money. I look foward to the next release! Thanks again for all of the wonderful music!
9889979942|5.0|An incredible books full of a real China.  China's majority overtakes the culture and population, and Carter has given a foothold to the minorities. The first book that truly captures China as an entire diverse country, from the rich to the poor, from beijing to guangzhou.  The images are beautiful, inpiring, and leave you wanting to explore China for yourself.
0374531269|5.0|A Long Way Gone: Memoirs of a Boy Soldier was a beautifully written story of a young man's journey through the jungles of hell as a boy solidier. I cringed, and held back tears as I turned the pages of this book. The pain, the loss of innocence and family, the fire of hope, and the spirit of forgiveness. It is a memorable story told by a resilient, gifted man going from tragedy to triumph.     Outstanding work!
B002UXRGLG|5.0|This documentary just show you how weak and fragile we are as creatures on earth. It simply show the greatness of the creator. All you need to know is open your eyes wide and listen to your inner voice while watching this extraordinary film.    A must for anyone who can see and act on what is seen
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I bought this for my grandson and he does not like any of his other pacifiers now.  It is great because it doesn't fall on the floor as rapidly as other ones and he can hold onto it like a favorite stuffed animal!  Saw it on the Today show and had to have one! Soo cute too.
1402760663|5.0|I bought this book as a birthday present for my dad (a history major in college). He read the original edition back when it came out, but now he's reading it again and appreciates the illustrations. It's definitely good enough to read twice (especially since it's been so long since he read it the first time). It's a very high quality edition and the content offers a much-needed alternative view of the history of the American West.
0143118420|1.0|Is it wrong of me to want to slap her?? I just really couldn't identify with the character because I thought she was a self-centered, over-privileged, egotistical b****. Like all of us, most problems are self-induced and rather than face and deal with them, she escapes. That is cowardice in my book and I can't respect someone that chooses cowardice over perseverance.<br /><br />It sounds like a lot of fun to just take off and I'm glad she chose to celebrate herself with her new-found wealth, but guess what sweetie - self-indulgence only takes you so far.<br /><br />I usually enjoy memoirs but the people have to be interesting to me, have to capture my emotions through growth and/or sentimentality, and this character did neither.<br /><br />Then they get J.Rob to play the lead; perfect casting. Doesn't look a thing like the author (I thought Elizabeth Mitchell would have been a much better choice) but the attitude is spot on! Good job Hollywood
B002BU0DPE|5.0|This is the best set of headphone/communicator on the market, hands down. I play CoD MW2 online.(Playstation username slappyslug) It is the only way to play online and still communicate with your team. You do not have to shout or worry about feedback or the sound of your TV effecting other players. I play Hardcore, and this has definitely given me an advantage. You can hear everything like you were in the game itself. If you are a serious or even a casual online player, you have to get these! BUY IT!!!!!!
0374531269|5.0|Andrew Klavan writes The Long Way Home in the first person serving to bring home the personal turmoil that the main character lives with. Charlie West, a 17 year old high schooler, who previously lived in a small town with his parents and sister, is on the run. He went to bed one night and woke up one year later accused of murdering his friend Alex and being a terrorist in an organization called \\"The Highlanders\\".  Charlie cannot remember what transpired duiring his lost year. He wonders if he really is a murderer and a terrorist. How can he prove his innocence and who is really behind all this? Was he framed, as his friends say, or did he really do these terrible things? Charlie returns to his home town, holing up in a vacant house called the \\"Ghost Mansion\\". He teams up with his friends Rick.Josh. Milner and his girlfriend Beth to discover the truth about the murder he can't remember and who is behind the Highlanders, a terrorist group.  A fun book for mystery readers. If you are new to this series, you must read the first book of the series to see what transpired in Charlie's life to bring him to the situation he finds himself in at the start of this book.
B003S897U0|5.0|Well here it is, Croweology in all its glory. When I first heard about the idea for this album I really didn't know how I was going to like it. I mean, how do you take great songs, re-record them acoustically and make them as good or better than the originals. Well folks, the Crowes did it! They have stripped these songs down to their basics and let their inner beauty shine! This album is as much a testament to the quality of the songs as it is to the band's musical ability. There is no smoke and mirrors here...these are top-notch musicians doing what they do best...expressing themselves through their music. There isn't a bad track on the album! \\"Share the Ride\\" grabbed my attention first, it starts with some cheesy drum machine kick and snare...and you think, \\"What the ...\\", but hang on it draws you in and becomes a fun ride. \\"Soul Singing', one of my favorite Crowes' songs grooves and moves as well as the original. \\"Ballad in Urgency / Wiser Time\\" are not that far removed from the originals, but just purer in its delivery.<br />There really isn't a need to do a song by song review here, because I would be saying the same thing over and over...great music! Croweology is a perfect example of less is more. The band demonstrates that you don't need all the effects and electric instruments to make great rock-n-roll. Buy this album with confidence and be thankful that we have had these dirty-birds singing to us for the past 20 years.

1433210428|4.0|I found Frankl referenced by Daniel Pink in his book, A Whole New Mind.    For me (very new to psychotherapy schools), Man's Search for Meaning is a very good introduction to logotherapy.  The book begins with Frankl's experiences in WWII Nazi concentration camps; later chapters explain logotherapy -- man's search for meaning.  I found the book to be fresh, insightful and I gained enough of an understanding of logotherapy to know I'd like to learn more. Frankl's work is especially relevant in our time.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|Love this DVD. Originally watched this on the Discovery channel but just cant get enough of it. Isn't the same as Oprah was the narrator in tv but enjoy listening to David's voice just as well.<br />A must see for anyone with children/grandchildren.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|1.  There's nothing more gratifying to see a movie based on excellent writing, an understandable story, and solid acting.  Mix in there various modern type twists to a classic tale and you have the ingredients for a completely entertaining / solid film.  No, this is not going to change your life or make you cry... but this is going to throughly entertain you;  an excellent film.<br />2.  Highly recommended.
B000KQGX1Y|5.0|I have been a fan of Celtic Woman for a number of years and finally bought this CD. This CD is like all Celtic Woman concerts, CDs and DVDs, wonderfully done and will make you laugh, cry and cheer. This CD is the deluxe edition with four additonal songs and a beautiful charm. The additional songs are Sing out, Shenandoah, At the Ceili and Spanish Lady.  These extra song are well worth the few extra dollars. Shenandoah, At the Ceili and Spanish Lady was recorded live in 2006 from the Slane Castle DVD ,something else that any Celtic Woman fan should have! These extra songs are well worth the few extra dollars. The charm should be worn by someone that your truely care about, but I think I want to keep it until I find that special girl. I love this CD and if you donot already own this CD and are a Celtic Woman fan or even if you like Celtic music, I highly recommend this CD. You will want to play this CD many many times.

B003TZ9EGO|4.0|Like everybody else, I'm googoo for Gaga, but not just because of the original versions of her pop classics.  For every hit she has, there are 5+ GREAT remixes to accompany them.  As a huge fan of dance/club music I think I actually prefer her remixes to the original most of the time.  This collection is a great representation of the versatility of her music and is also a good sample of some of her best remixes.<br /><br />HOWEVER...<br /><br />After you have bought this CD (It's only $7.99, why not?) you'll need to seek out some other Gaga remixes conveniently located on AmazonMP3 because frankly, there are some EPIC masterpieces out there that unfortunately didn't make it to this CD.  Here's my Must List:<br /><br />- LoveGame (Dave Aude mix)<br />- Poker Face (Jody den Broeder Remix)<br />- Paparazzi (James Carameta Tabloid Remix) - (DJ Dan mix is my personal favorite, but I can't find it on AmazonMp3)<br />- Telephone (Crookers Vocal Remix) (Kaskade Mix is also great)<br />- Alejandro (Dave Aude Mix)<br />- Bad Romance (Chew Fu H1N1 Fix)<br />- Just Dance (HCCR's Bambossa Main Mix) (Can't find this on AmazonMp3 either)<br /><br />And those are just some that come to mind.  Gaga really goes all out when releasing singles and no one appreciates that more than me.  If you haven't yet discovered the power of a Gaga club remix, you have a lot of catching up to do!  Get this CD, check out the other remixes I've listed, and then buy the individual single CDs if you still haven't got enough.  They're well worth it!
9889979942|5.0|I reside in North Carolina, I met Tom Carter on Facebook,  he's an individual that cares about others.  He introduced me to his book China: Portrait of the People.    After reading the book Tom gave me a sense of freedom, adventure and a desire to visit China some day. He captured the people in China, their culture through pictures and stories, their personality, concerns, feelings, and everyday life. Many of us [wherever we live] do not realize that people in China go through the same challenges we do. Happiness, losses, joy, fears of the unknown, little food, passions, loneliness and love.    The Photos are stunning, vivid, beautiful, eye catching, sad, overwhelming and beautiful. Opened my eyes of life for ways I can share with others too.  Thank you again, Tom, for this wonderful Book China: Portrait of the People
0439023483|1.0|I've never read Battle Royale, but after reading the synopsis, I can see what people are angry about. Blatant plagiarism aside, though, this book is pretty awful. The whole premise is so implausible and simplistic that it's impossible to care about what happens to any of the characters. And there really isn't much to like about the characters, except for maybe Peeta. As for Katniss, we never learn who she really is, since people get killed off in the arena before she has to make any real moral decision. As much as she tells the reader how wrong she believes the system to be, she basically goes along with it right to the very end.    Speaking of the end, it is very weak. Yes, this book is part of planned trilogy, but could the author have made it any more obvious?    I just can't understand why this book is so popular, while other books that are many, many times better fall under the radar. If you're a fan of mediocre literature, by all means read this book, but otherwise, it's just not worth it.
B003NHRIVQ|4.0|As others have said, this is not great filmmaking. But it stars Miley Cyrus who has a big fan base and THOSE are the folks who will frock to the DVD. And that's okay. It teaches a moral lesson and has the music that her fans love. How the other two lead actors got equal size billing on the cover is an unknown. Miley is all over the DVD! There are music videos, Making of the Miley Video with Miley  and more  Also a tour of the set with Bobby Coleman (who did NOT make the cover billing). There is an alternate ending (choose which one you want) and the usual \\"deleted scenes\\".<br /><br />I'm not a teen (nor a girl) and so I certainly couldn't relate to lead character. I probably identify more with the father.<br /><br />Choosing a star rating is hard.. It's a mixed bag. The high star rating is to recommend it to Cyrus' fan base and any teen who \\"sorta likes her\\" as an actress. (After all Hannah Montana is a role.) But if you are not watching this with your kids, and are over 20, you can probably find other DVDs to watch with your precious tine.<br /><br />Steve Ramm<br />\\"Anything Phonographic\\"
030726999X|3.0|If you read the second book you have to read this one, though the action is not quite as physical as the others. Stieg Larsson does changes gears and focus on the finale. This one focuses on Lisbeth's trial and exposing the secrets within the government. I enjoyed the last third of the book the most. I feel this is the weakiest of the three books but a very forfilling ending for fans. Enjoyed the series, will miss the characters. I lean toward 3.5 stars.
0307476154|2.0|Larsson certainly enjoyed his narratives. If you didn't care for them in the first book, you're going to spend a lot of this one skimming though hundreds of pages of repetitious thoughts and information. I enjoyed the idea of this story, but so much of this book focused on information that you already had, which made it hard for me to care when something new finally happened. I understand that the book was not originally written in English, and can only hope it lost something in translation because the language is incredibly dull. It seems like every single item that could have been mentioned simply as a gun, motorcycle, sofa, or laptop had a two line full name and description each time one of them popped up. It was frustrating to wade through. The big revelation could not have been less dramatic, and there was absolutely no ending to this book. I wish I'd stopped with book one of this series, because this one leaves more questions than answers, and I just don't think I have the patience to struggle through book three.
B003VB5D84|4.0|I have both of the previous DVDs of the Crossroads festivals, 2004 and 2007, I have played guitar for almost 15 years, I have been in the music business in one way or another for over 40 years. These are some of the best live music videos I have ever seen, especially the 2007 one, the songs Jeff Beck does are worth the price of admission alone. His technique is unmatched. I have pre-ordered the 2010 DVD just to see Jeff Beck again, but I know there will be more jems inside waiting to be enjoyed. The guy who gave it a one star is probably a guitar snob, I've had to deal with them over the years, not everybody who's good gets famous and makes a lot of money, in fact almost nobody gets famous and makes a lot money, especially people who are only trying to do just that. So buy this DVD, enjoy it, buy a guitar, practice and have fun, there is nothing wrong with playing a 1,4,5 progression 'till the day you die! It's a blast!
B00168OINK|4.0|Nothing ground breaking or suspenseful about the main story line, it is very typical there.    Graphics, effects, while great is also nothing that blows your mind away.    Still, it is a load of fun, witty, and incorporates enough of the traditional Chinese Kung-fu mystique to make it interesting even for fans well aware of Chinese martial arts literature.     But really, you don't watch this movie to find something that you couldn't find watching other movies - it's simply well-crafted and not lacking.
0385732554|5.0|From its terrific opening line (\\"It was almost December, and Jonas was beginning to be frightened\\") to its closing image of an exhilarating sled ride, this work of speculative fiction keeps the reader engaged and thinking. Imagine a closed community in the far distant future which has no animals, no music, no weather apart from mild nothing, and no love. It's a village from which variety and diversity have been expunged, full of people who do not experience strong emotions or perceive colors.     The rule-driven community runs like clockwork: everyone has an assigned job, mate, and children. Difference, disabilities, and dissent are simply not tolerated. As in the dystopian novel Brave New World, children are created in batches. They are raised to the age of one by a staff of nurturers, then distributed to suitable couples who have been matched up by committee. Everything is mandated by committee, down to the smallest detail like what toys children can play with and for how long. Sickly children, elderly people, and disorderly citizens are eliminated by lethal injection (\\"released\\").     But the normal emotions, perceptions and memories of human beings have not been lost: they repose in the mind and person of the community's Receiver. Like a bizarre Christ figure, the Receiver bears alone the messy, complicated, chaotic thoughts that human beings used to experience. He or she (the Receiver is an appointed post) also contains the positive memories: sunshine, rainbows, Christmas gatherings. The Receiver holds those emotions and memories apart which would otherwise complicate the perfectly ordered community. Without a container, these memories would be part of everyone in the community.    Jonas, the protagonist, becomes the Receiver in training, and starts to receive the memories telepathically. He quickly becomes convinced that the situation is untenable. The people should experience these emotions and learn to cope with them. With the encouragement of the Giver (theformer Receiver), Jonas makes a daring escape from Sameness. The community, without its Receiver for the first time in ages, will have to manage as humans have always done.    The book is smoothly written, and presents a credible alternative universe. It might legitimately be called fantasy fiction, or even science fiction. Any middle school reader could handle the text and its underlying ideas, but like all great children's literature, adults would appreciate it as well. The author turned this book into the first of a trilogy; the other titles are Gathering Blue and The Messenger.
0307474712|4.0|It took me a while to finish this highly readable novel. What prompted me to keep putting this book down was that I found Dexter, one of the main characters, so unlikable hat I couldn't figure out why anyone would put up with him. He does become somewhat redeemable at the end of the book, otherwise the end of the novel would have been insufferable.    I like David Nicholls' writing (and I have enjoyed his past works as well) though I think sometimes he's trying to show how clever he is and I found this book sometimes more depressing than funny or witty. Yet there's no denying that the leap in time from chapter to chapter is an irresistible device that keeps you reading.    I think the character of Emma saves this novel and I can't say I was happy with her outcome. She really is one of the few likable people in the entire book. But she does make the book worth your time.    I have no doubt that if done right, though, this will make a smashing film.
B003K025TQ|4.0|I've always been a fan of Lee Ritenour since the \\"Captain Fingers\\" days. Its almost a mini history of guitar of the last 30 years in a way. From straight ahead to rock - overall its not my favorite Lee Ritenour CD/album but still glad I purchased it.
B003JSU2NU|5.0|I think this CD captures the essence of the movie. Captures the essence of the Twilight trios dilemma.
B000V8I2QU|3.0|I became a Bruce fan the first time I heard Darkness On The Edge Of Town, I thought his earlier work was a ham-fisted attempt to appropriate Dylan. Nebraska and  The River are also great masterworks but with Born In The USA Bruce started to become too comercial for my esoteric tastes, yeah I'm a \\"music snob\\" I only have two types of music in my collection-essential and absolutely essential. The critics keep giving Bruce 4-5 stars on all his recent stuff but seriously I find it lacks inspiration, yeah the Bruce signature sound is there but I've heard it all before.  If you can listen to The River and then listen to Magic and say he hasn't lost anything you need to check your depthometer for music listening.  Buy Chuck Prophet's Soap and Water , Dan Auerbach's Keep It Hid or Tom Petty's Mojo if you want some great inspired R&R that keeps the tradition going.
B0035G9ABG|4.0|You can never accuse the Gorillaz camp of giving you the same thing over and over. Whether you like the music or not, this group always does a good job of keping you interested through various types of media and articles. In \\"Gorillaz UK\\" the group took a stand against the predictable, boring, garbage being pumped out by the music industry. They wanted to present something brand new and so it started that the world became addicted to music and videos that were not only dispalayed in an animated setting, but by an animated band. After that, \\"Demon Days\\" took aim at the violence and war that was being pushed on civillians who had nothing to do with the extremists, politicians, or oil companies that were causing destruction worldwide.     In \\"Plastic Beach\\" the Gorillaz put the spotlight on the earth's plague of polloution, and flips it by announcing the group has a new home on a private island which is completely comprised of litter. Tracks like \\"Some kind of Nature\\" and \\"Pirate Jet\\" highlight the rubbish. I'll focus on the music for this review as there is just too much publicity, videos, artwork, and sub-stories related to the release of \\"Plastic Beach\\" to comment on.     The album can described in a word as whimsical. The music is different from the last album just as the last album was different from it's prior version. The Brits have described this album as being more \\"pop\\" inspired than previous releases, but brit pop is a genre hard to define especially by other cultures. With tracks like \\"Glitter Freeze\\" paying homage to the Glitter Beat (A beat coined and named after the \\"Glitter Band\\") the listener will have to dig a little deeper to understand and apprecite the album, thereby forcing the fan to research and relate the music to the world of Gorillaz (Mission accomplished).  The Band's usual vocalist (2D, Albarn) takes a backseat ride on this album as 12 of the 16 tracks feture guest artists most of whom take the lead on the songs. This trend started on \\"Demon Days\\" but is more apparent on \\"Plastic Beach\\".     If you are not true Gorillaz fan and have no desire to waste time on the extensive plots and schemes of the Gorillaz, then you will probably hate this album. Die hard fans seem to love it. As a fan and a music enthusiast, The album seems to do to me what it does to most people who own it...grows on me. The more I listen to it, the more I appreciate it and find myself randomly humming, or singing under my voice, snippets from tracks that make no sense to the average person passing by (ie: \\"Super Fast Jellyfish\\"). Steal this album from your older brother and give it a listen over a few times before deciding on your own copy.
B001H9JBW6|1.0|I am very fond of British drama on TV, and I am a regular watcher of Masterpiece Theater (and its two spin-off features, Masterpiece Mystery and Masterpiece Contemporary).  However, I did not catch The Last Enemy when it appeared on TV in early 2008.  After reading the reviews in Amazon (seven very enthusiastic and one very negative), I bought the set.  I have watched an episode a night for the past five nights.  My opinion: The Last Enemy is not very good.  From the very first episode I found it very difficult to follow.  It moves too fast for me, without sufficient explanation, sufficient clues, to know what is going on even superficially.  At the end of an episode I found myself somewhat puzzled and annoyed.  It is not very clear just who is who and just how they are related to each other in their roles and jobs.  There is a good deal of sliding ID cards through the door locks, submitting to an eye scan to get through gates, etc.  In the course of five episodes this kind of action becomes just too much -- too much running down a corridor, opening a door with an ID card, then running down a set of stairs, opening another door and bursting into a room where another character is sitting at a computer.  Too much quick scene changing from one group to another, and back and forth changing from group to group, cutting the action into little bits and pieces.  I found the last episode - number 5 - the best of the lot, because it explained more clearly, made more sense, went more slowly, with people talking clearly to each other.  But it too was disappointing - with a disappointing ending.    I found the love story very poorly related to the main plot of suspense: complete information control and thereby people control, political intrigue, and terrorism.  It is also very poorly developed and portrayed, the animal ferocity of Michael's widow in the very first episode being somewhat ridiculous and unbelievable.  The ready complicity of Stephen at this point was also unbelievable.  I found the resolution of this love triangle also very unsatisfactory - and ubelievable.     This story was shown on TV over a period of five weeks - five Sundays, starting in February 2008.  I wonder how many people who began it stayed with it until the end.  Watching it on DVD, I had the opportunity to re-run scenes I did not quite catch - to pick up the bits of dialogue I could not understand at the first playing.  Viewers of the actual Sunday night TV Masterpiece Theater did not have that luxury -- they got it the first time or they didn't get it.  How many lasted through all five Sunday nights?    Finally, this DVD set really needs English subtitles.  It does not have them.  At this date (2010) there is no excuse for that.  (Incidentally, the directions on the screen state that you can have subtitles by clicking on your remote control.  I clicked on mine for each disc and got nothing but the off sign.)    More and more I am finding that the Masterpiece Contemporary shows do not quite satisfy.  They do not in my opinion match Masterpiece Theater or Masterpiece Mystery - not by half.  This DVD set of The Last Enemy confirms my opinion.  I now wish I had saved my money and borrowed this set from the public library.
B003O85W3A|5.0|I picked up an advance copy of The Arcade Fire's third album, The Suburbs, at the band's outstanding August 1, 2010 Boston show, at which the band premiered (in the US) eight of the new album's sixteen tracks.      The Arcade Fire's first two albums, Funeral (2004) and Neon Bible (2007), amounted to a one-two punch that - like Radiohead's The Bends and OK Computer of a decade prior - were two of the best, if not the two very best, albums of the 00's.  The Arcade Fire's first two albums were unique in the way they wove dense, intricate, layers of (often dark) music, beautiful and emotional vocal harmonies, incorporation of strings as actual components of the songs (not something added after the fact), insightful and thought provoking lyrics (often in French; the band is based in Montreal), often addressing a young generation's grappling with coming of age, and featuring stadium ready anthems alongside beautiful ballads.    Arcade Fire's music requires - and rewards -- repeated listening.  That makes a review of this new release somewhat difficult, because like a great wine, the band's music does not fully reveal itself on the first few listens.  With the foregoing caveat, I'll do the best I can, having now listened to the album several times, including on a pair of high quality headphones.  Indeed, the album sounds better on each listen.        So what about The Suburbs?  As the title suggests, the album is something of a concept album about life in the suburbs, where the band members were raised.  But the band doesn't just look back; the band examines the present and looks forward (\\"Sometimes I can't believe it; I'm moving past the feeling\\"), being ready for children (\\"I want a daughter while I'm still young\\") and laments the loss of old friends (\\"All my old friends they don't know me now\\").      Musically, the album is excellent, although, based on my initial listens, it does not strike me as being quite at the same level as the band's first two stellar albums.  The songwriting is once again first rate.  The music is not as dark or as dense (though it is still layered) as the band's earlier work.  This is a cleaner sounding, and more (indie) mainstream sounding Arcade Fire than its fans have previously heard (\\"Half Light I,\\" for example, reminds me of The Broken Bells and MGMT).  Moreover, there are no anthems here on the level of \\"Wake Up\\" or \\"No Cars Go.\\"  Having said that, once you get beyond comparisons with its predecessors, this album is a great listen, full of terrific and diverse songs that, as aforesaid, will repay repeated listening.  There are some excellent upbeat songs, such as \\"Ready To Start,\\" \\"City With No Children\\" and \\"Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains),\\" songs featuring atmospheric layers of sound, such as \\"Rococo,\\" and some beautiful ballads, such as the aforementioned \\"Half Light I,\\" \\"Wasted Hours,\\" \\"Deep Blue,\\" and \\"We Used To Wait.\\"  The vocal harmonies, featuring husband and wife Win Butler (who reminds me of David Byrne of The Talking Heads) and Regine Chassagne (her strongest album yet), on this new release are terrific, as is the musicianship.  Many songs flow into one another to create a seamless web of sound that really sets The Arcade Fire apart from its contemporaries.      Incidentally, as reported on the band's website, this CD has been released with eight different covers; I believe that the artwork for each of the front covers is included in the CD booklet, which also features the album's handwritten lyrics.       In sum, The Suburbs is an excellent album that, even if not quite at the stellar level of Funeral and Neon Bible, is a strong candidate for the best album of the year.
0446567337|5.0|Very good novel.  Sweet and romantic and a little sad.  The movie doesn't do it justice, the book is 10x better!!
B003UYUR10|5.0|Most of the time, when I read a review, I wonder if the person has any credibility that is writing the review (ie: do they see a lot of movies and have discretion or are they the occasional movie goer). I have been an avid fan of the film industry since I was a kid, and I own over 700 movies. There's my cred.      Do not listen to the crackpot at the bottom of the page. I have not only played every Prince of Persia game, but I was a serious doubter in the video game to film adaption of this (kept replaying the nightmare that was \\"Doom\\"). I was extremely surprised. I am not a Jake Gyllenhall fan, but I am a Bruckheimer fan. And, I am, for the most part, a Disney fan. Apparently the reviewer at the bottom cant accurately critique a Disney film, because he doesn't even appreciate what was \\"Pirates\\".      Prince of Persia delivers in every way imaginable, and reminded me why I loved going to the movies in the first place. Is Jake Leo DiCapprio in a Scorcese film? Of course not. Is the movie realistic? Of course not, its a DISNEY FANTASY MOVIE. If you think it should be realistic, then you are the reason for the \\"do not try this at home\\" warnings on TV that the rest of the known world finds insulting. Is the movie well acted? Absolutely, for the type of movie. Is the action in the movie sufficient? More than. Is the movie enjoyable? Hell yea! I had a blast. I loved the chemistry between Jake and Gemma, and thought Bruckheimer made a convincing and thoroughly thought through story for a game that really didn't have that thorough a plot line to begin with. Excellent score for Disney, and it would make a grand classic for the whole family if added to your collection. I can't wait for it to come out.
0385342039|5.0|I am a huge Sophie Kinsella, and if you are a fan as well- I'd definitely recommend this book! It has friendship, roamance and mystery... it's everything you want in a chick-lit novel! If you haven't read it yet- go buy it... TODAY!

B001UV4XUQ|5.0|I must admit that ordinarily a film about love and loss isn't my cup of tea.  I actually would have never seen this film if it hadn't been for my best guy buddies encouraging me to see it.    But once I saw it, I couldn't stop at one viewing.  I watched this movie back-to-back-to-back on a flight to Australia and loved it each and every time.  Marc Webb is a very talented director who knows precisely what kind of performances and emotions he's trying to evoke from his actors.  It also doesn't hurt that the chemistry between Zooey Deschanel and Joseph Gordon-Levitt is genuinely believable and, dare I say it, real.  Each actor really delves head-on into the psyche of their characters, with their respective characters coming across as surprisingly ordinary people.    The visuals and the music are perfectly fitting and it is very evident that both the cast and the crew were very intent on producing an interesting, entertaining and well-done film, not to mention it actually makes the city of Los Angeles appear, well, NORMAL!    The vividness of the picture and sound are made more so through the Blu-ray version of the film and it doesn't hurt that this version also includes a digital copy for me to put on my iPhone.    All in all - an extremely entertaining film with a believable story and very capable actors.  Definitely a good choice for a date movie.
B001TH8UUA|5.0|I needed a little longer cord.  Moved some equipment around.  The cord arrived on time and was exactly as advertised.  The big advantage was price. Much less than here in Dallas plus they deliver!
0446563048|5.0|This is a great book for anyone that has an entreprenurial spirit. I was searching for a business book that didn't have a lot of fluff that went straight to the facts. I found it in this book. Great source of information. Its a great way to learn about how a business can grow quickly and profit from giving good customer service.
B001E2JNA6|4.0|I just watched the entire Blu-ray version yesterday.  I have the DVD as well.  Sometimes the quality of the Blu-ray is horrible, light colors and facial tomes seem to be swimming in gray pixels.  This is especially evident in scenes of candlelight or half-light in rooms.  It looks to me like they over-sharpened a great deal of the film, but I have no idea how Blu-rays are produced and what they had to work with in the original.  I am glad I bought it, this is an amazing adaptation.  Firth is simply wonderful and Ehle is fantastic.
B001F7XIK6|5.0|One of the best albums I've ever bought. Gojira's music has so much feeling that I just can't describe how good it is, and the vinyl sounds even better than the CD version.  Highly recommended.

B000Y7U98W|4.0|Take out the alien from Alien, the monolith from 2001, the surfing from Dark Star and you end up with Sunshine, a movie where no one is safe. This review contains spoilers.<br /><br />Sunshine is about the last gasp of the human race.  In an effort to reignite the dying sun, the crew of the Icarus II plans to deliver a star-igniting bomb to its core.  The odds are grim - there's no guarantee that the plan will work, as evidenced by the disappearance of Icarus I.  On the way to their destination, the astronauts face a series of hostile environments, including each other.<br /><br />The cinematography in Sunshine is interesting.  Horror movies work well in theaters because they are dark, so the audience can actually feel what it's like to be immersed in darkness.  In contrast, Sunshine is a bright film, with light pouring out of every frame.  My tiny television simply did not do it justice, although I would have serious concerns about migraines watching Sunshine in a theater.<br /><br />The movie parallels are apt.  Sunshine's down-to-earth astronauts are tiny beings on a vast ship, just like in Alien.  When the crew discovers the distress beacon of another ship, it's a test of their resolve. Each crewman has a specialty, and as circumstances break down beyond their control, the chain of command messily reorganizes itself until true leaders arise.<br /><br />Like 2001, space is an unforgiving place.  Sunshine is slowly paced, punctuated with moments of sheer terror.  The environment itself is an enemy, and the astronauts are drowned, frozen, burned, asphyxiated, strangled, stabbed, and bludgeoned to death. There's also a battle between man and machine as the computer on board Icarus II makes decisions (or withholds information) without the consent of the crew for the greater good.  The painstaking accuracy that director Danny Boyle infused in the film is Kubrickian in its level of detail. Although fantastical elements are included, Boyle consulted with many experts, subjected the cast to several immersive techniques, and basically treated this film as if it were an epic release worthy of scientific critique.<br /><br />And finally, like Dark Star, this film features a giant bomb.<br /><br />Sunshine is dense with important details.  Unfortunately, many of these details are lost by poor editing. There is a narrator that's hard to hear, muttering by characters in thick accents that are hard to understand, and the design of the ship isn't always apparent.  There are jump cuts to scenes that break continuity, such that it becomes difficult to tell where the astronauts are in relationship to each other and the ship.<br /><br />Sunshine's conclusion tries to have it both ways: human enlightenment transposed with a Freddy Kreuger-like psychopath on the loose. The titular bad guy, Pinbacker, is something of a science hobgoblin. Sunshine works overtime trying to explain everything...until a burned, naked, shimmering, ship-jumping fundamentalist starts murdering people. Your mileage will vary according to how much you value scientific accuracy.<br /><br />I liked it.l immersive techniques, and basically treated this film as if it were an epic release worthy of scientific critique.

B0018PH3L0|5.0|I didn't ever have the time to watch this when it first came out, I was working over 100 hours a week. When I saw this on DVD a few years ago I had bought it and I wish I had watched it years ago when it was on. When it was done I wished there was more, I did get the other movies that would like this. It is great to just get lost into it.

B000S88JTS|5.0|This is just one of those classic motorcycle movies that belongs in any motorcyclist's collection. Perfect for a snowy winter afternoon. Classic Bruce Brown. When it debuted in 1971 it drew MANY people into motorcycle dealerships that probably wouldn't have ever gone - and they bought motorcycles! It could do that same thing now, even though it's 40 years old. When making \\"[[ASIN:B000H8RYJA Into the Wind]]\\" producer Chris Page and myself (writer) would ask ourselves, What would Bruce Brown do? Our answer is our movie. As for the Director's Cut version? The extra stuff is cool; icing on the cake and worth the few extra bucks.
0385504225|1.0|I read \\"Da Vinci Code\\" with amusement though I was quite discontent with some flaws then.  When I read \\"Lost Symbol,\\" my common sense kept bugging me if I should read on.  Finally I stopped after finishing half of the book, after finishing section 57.  Consider these:    1.  A Harvard professor, world renowned scholar, could be so naive and green that he \\"always\\" failed to understand the obvious.  But when prompted, be suddenly turned from a nerd to genius, then giving long lecturing as if coming out of a coma.  In \\"Da Vinci Code,\\" he lectured something utmost secretive (to the main lady character) while travelling hurriedly on a taxi.  At least I wouldn't talk something sensitive when travelling on taxi.      2.  All these episodes, car chases, man chases, break-ins, e.g. happened in amazingly such short time frames.  These are common plots found in \\"Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons.\\"  No doubt in this thick book of course.  More outrageous to my mortal common sense mind is: all the cities, particuarly the law-enforecement units, must have been asleep, or on strike, when these characters \\"ventured\\" around the cities and buildings.  In this book, how the hell could I be persuaded to believe that the gate to National Museum (?) is guarded only by one man?  And when this guy smelled something wrong, he didn't alert others or call for reinforcement?      3.  A guy (the devil bad guy) coming out of nowhere could rise to top level of Freemasons - 33th level - in a mere 10-year period?  And this guy has to ALWAYS cover his full-body tattoos with heavy make-ups.  If these freemasons didn't raise any suspicion with him, they aren't that bright.  And no need to try getting in this so-called the most scret organization in the world.      Dan Brown was always able to identify themes that are highly interesting and appealing.  But he stepped short of providing enough thoroughness and reasoning in details of the stories.  As I read on, I kept asking myself if I should spendtime, suppressing my common sense, on this unusually thick book.  I finally gave up.      Instead, I had the same experience with \\"Angels and Demons.\\"  Make no mistake, I finished reading some other greater (thicker) works by more accomplished writers.  If it were not for the cheaper price retailed in UK, I certainly would not have picked up this book.
B001UV4XUG|3.0|Marc Webb's indie twenty-something romantic comedy takes place in a Los Angeles that conforms pretty much as to how its hero, Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), is himself: clean, hip, and retro. The film's narration sets us up to believe the film will be pretty much equally about how Tom, a greeting-card writer who once dreamed of being an architect, and Summer (Zooey Deschanel), his boss's assistant and the girl of his dreams, will see their ensuing relationship, although the reality is that the movie is mostly from Tom's perspective and Summer exists mostly as a commitment-phobic enigma to break his heart. (Her two-dimensionality is signaled by the film's cringe-worthy title pun.) The film, as has been noted elsewhere, is less original than it purports to be, although its playful time scheme (it zips back and forth from different points in their relationship--from infatuation to early love to disillusionment) is one of the most interesting things in the movie; among the least are derivative fantasy sequences where Tom sings his love with a crowd in a park (with a cartoon bird) and sees his relationship as a Bergman film. The best thing the film has going for it is Gordon-Levitt, whose animated eyebrows and cartoon squiggle of a mouth are marvelously expressive: he deserves a better film. The film seems to be a kind of advertisement for IKEA (there are multiple scenes set in the Los Angeles store) and for color-coding your wardrobe: Gordon-Levitt keeps to browns and blacks (with early 1980s skinny ties and cardigans), while Deschanel affects deep blues. How either of them affords their spectacularly expensive wardrobes, or their beautifully appointed one-bedroom private apartments in downtown Los Angeles, is something the filmmakers never explain.
B0036TGSR6|5.0|THE GHOST WRITER begins in medias res -  no credits, no lead in, just a dead body lying along the coast of either Cape Cod or Martha's Vineyard, and this creepy beginning remains the tenor throughout this very smart and very gripping drama based on the book 'The Ghost' by Robert Harris as adapted for the screen by the author and by the director Roman Polanski (the Cape Cod/Martha's Vineyard scenes were shot in Germany due to the political decisions about Polanski's being in the US).  This is one of those films, thankfully, that requires full attention for its 128 minute duration, as every word of the dialog is meaningful and additive to the plot/conundrum of the story.<br /><br />Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) is the British Prime Minister, electing to live in the US with his wife Ruth (Olivia Williams) and crew including his personal secretary Amelia (Kim Cantrall) while the media and the public in England is outraged at the news that Lang has allegedly turned over suspected terrorists to the CIA, a move that includes the dastardly water torture rendition.  Lang is in the process of writing his memoirs with a ghost writer who just happens to be the man we saw dead in the surf at films opening.  On the mainland agent Rick Ricardelli (Jon Bernthal) convinces one of his clients to be the replacement for the dead ghost writer - the unnamed ghost is Ewan McGregor.  Reluctantly the new ghost travels out to the home of Lang and in studying the apparently inept memoir manuscript begins his re-write.  Slowly incidents occur that lead the ghost to information that all is not as it appears with Adam Lang: meetings with an apparent old Cambridge friend Paul Emmett (Tom Wilkinson), a wily old codger who has seen a lot on the beaches (Eli Wallach), and a time alone with Ruth while Lang is away with Amelia on a speaking tour to assuage the public hate are mixed with espionage like incidents and ultimately discoveries as to the truth about Lang. Ghost eventually breaks the code that is hidden in plain sight. It is a tight story and on that holds attention well for the long duration of the film.  There are some fine actors in small roles - James Belushi, Timothy Hutton, etc - and every detail of the script and acting is first rate.

B003O7I6L6|4.0|The original aspect ratio of this film is 2.35, just as the 2003 Special Edition. This blu-ray lists the ratio as 1.85. Is this a typo, or has the blu-ray been released with the incorrect ratio ? Anybody ?
0307269981|2.0|The sad part is that it could have been a good book. Eliminate about a third of the material, which basically consists of irrelevant information, stop showing off, quit the mathematical stuff that does not impress anybody, concentrate on one thing and stop torturing women: it's sadistic and places the book in a less respectable category. I am personally tired of books that resort to abusing women as a way to create suspense.<br />The best part of the book is the main character, Salander. She needs refining, but she is a very original sort of immoral heroine.

014062029X|5.0|Nineteenth century literary classic, details a man seeling his wife and daughter and the long term consequence. It's a pretty powerful and deeply ambitious story, one that makes up for a couple feeble plot stimulators with a powerful psychological representation. What's most interesting is the protagonist, the titular individual. A man so committed to drunk and evasion that he will sell off his own family. Also a man that works across the rest of the novel to redeem himself from this moment, but not without much backsliding and fresh egotistical mistakes. He's also capable enough to claw his way up into a position of wealth and authority, but then later lose that fortune, and the book is quite effective in showing the degree to which his admuirable qualities are tied in with his core defects. He's far from a monster, and for all the damage his pride and spiteful rejection cause to other lives there is much to admire about him, his strength of character, his general optimism and the way he's able to come forth with strong ethical choice at the most surprising moments. He's an intriguing, complex and overall plausible character, most notably in the way that none of his grand transcendetal moments lack, the way he continually reverts back partially to his earlier ways.<br /><br />More generally, the work shows an engaging cynicism about the status of class, gender and hypocrisy in contemporary England. There are some very strong critiques in here against Victorian society, to the extent that I'm surprised it attained the popularity it did in its own time, and these are always coonected to an engaging novel. It makes me a lot more interested in reading the other nineteenth century literary classics I've so far neglected. And more Hardy, of course.<br /><br />Worse than: Crime and Punishment by Fyodor Dostoevsky<br />Better than: A Tale of Two Cities by Charles Dickens<br />Also better than: Jude the Obscure by Thomas Hardy
B0017ZB8M6|1.0|\\"I Kissed A Girl\\" is very catchy, but the rest of this album is just terrible.  She has a very irritating, quavery, screechy, weird voice that I just don't like and the songs are annoying.
0192805606|5.0|There's one point in the novel in which one of the characters reflects on the form of perceiving others. Looking at people from a distance, she thinks that this way of identifying and following others through their outlines is one workable approach. It can be taken, as I believe it's meant to be, as an analogy for the whole form of the book. In a way it's a book of intensely realized, complex, three dimensional characters each of whom encounters the other as if the outsider were a two dimensional sketch, lacking real substance. More than direct conflict, this aspect of the perception renders a deep insubstantiality in the social ties that people build, and the deep distance that they build more effectively. The isolation doesn't emerge just from self-absorption, rather it's a sense of lacking the language or real community for authentic relation. In this amazingly writen account that manifests not in the major dramatic disconnect we might expect but in quiet, subdued points of systemic, often unnoticed, rupture.     It's a beautiful, heartfelt and deeply sophisticated novel. Says a lot about class, gender, family and the way such conditions shifted into the first world war, all in under two hundred pages. Deservedly classic, and indicates that Woolf applied a comparable level of talent to her fiction as to her essays.

B00129H7VS|5.0|This is the best mini-series I have ever seen period.  I spent way too many hours watching the DVD format, and once the Blu-Ray became available, it was almost like watching a brand new 10-part movie.  The images are just incredible and the action appears to be much more, er, gritty in HD.  In a good way!<br /><br />If you enjoyed Saving Private Ryan, you'll probably enjoy this mini-series twice as much.  They don't pull any punches or follow typical Hollywood story lines.  It really shows how dangerous WWII was, but also how the paratroopers went above and beyond to help defeat the Germans.  The actors did an outstanding job in their roles and it's always fun to see Peter from OfficeSpace in a serious role and getting a cameo from Simon Pegg was a treat too.<br /><br />This was the last war where the two sides were distinct and the firepower near equal and both sides fought bravely in the face of uncertainty.  This is only the story of the 101st Airborne, but gives us an accurate glance into the struggles that WWII vets once faced.
B00136S0NE|5.0|I won't waste words - this is one of the best movie soundtracks I've ever heard. After I couldn't get the songs from the movie out of my head, I was thrilled to find I could download the entire album for so little on Amazon. If you play an instrument, or love passionate vocals, rent the movie. You'll probably buy the soundtrack after that.

0316017922|4.0|Malcolm Gladwell is the best writer of detective stories currently active, except that the mysteries he probes are found in the \\"real\\" world. In this book, the author encounters head-on one of the major enigmas of modernity: the self-made man, the exceptional individual who creates a new industry or revolutionizes an entire way life. Like a Sherlock Holmes of the social sciences, he exquisitely peels layer after layer of the myth and exposes certain fallacies that lie beneath our perception of the genius. Drawing second-hand from pioneering research in many different fields, the author places several success stories under the microscope and picks out apparently minor details and seemingly inconsequential quirks. He finds not only an exceptional individual, but also a set of exceptional circumstances, a generation, a historical moment, a family, an entire culture, and sometimes mere accidents.<br /><br />This conclusion, although interesting in itself, would beg the question of why the book is worth reading. After all, if I suffered the misfortune of not being born in the 1840's --and thus missed out on the most vital period of industrialization in the United States-- what is the use? Most of these decisive quirks are quite beyond the grasp of an individual's will. And that is where the real beauty of this book can be found. These insights are translated into what could be called the large-scale \\"engineering of opportunity.\\" In Gladwell's opinion, the complex array of handicaps and advantages into which we are born and which shape our lives can be both a burden and a blessing, but never a destiny. And this is why the book is worth reading (aside from the brilliant writing): using the separate examples of airline pilots and disadvantaged children in a an experimental New York school, the author lays out the case for how more individuals can be afforded the opportunities to improve their lives. And always in the Gladwellian rhythm, with apparent digressions that lead through unexpected pathways to the most startling discoveries and, ultimately, to what I usually look for in a book: a sense of wonder.unexpected pathways to the most startling discoveries and, ultimately, to what I usually look for in a book: a sense of wonder.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|This is great recording of Joe Bonamassa.  I went back and listen to some of his music because this Live Album was the first time I had ever heard of him and this Live Album is so much better.  The image on the cover is so totally not him, image speaking.  But the way he plays is.  I will also buy the CD format once it is released.  At the end of the concert he gets into some free wheeling and cuts into some Jimmy Page lyrics of \\"Rock and Roll\\" and also plays some ZZ Top as well.  This is worth what you pay for it.  I have been listening to it for two weeks straight now, at home and in my car.
B000002GJH|3.0|If you are just a causal fan of either pearl jam or sound garden then this collaboration might not be for you. In my opinion there are really just two tracks that have mass appeal and the rest is an acquired taste.

B003CN5SAY|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />For it's first two strong seasons, Nip/Tuck was one of my favorite shows (and my favorite show not on premium cable). It featured strong performances, interesting characters, and an entertaining critique of beauty, success, sex, and the American dream.<br /><br />Sadly, by its third season, Nip/Tuck had devolved into a hypersexualized, sensationalistic, and juvenille mess. Instead of surprising the audience with the arcs of the characters, the show often just chose to go for cheap, sordid stunts, and the characters, although still played by strong actors, were just going from one outrageous scenario to another without any believable development. Even when the show moved from Miami to L.A. in its fifth season, little seemed to change.<br /><br />The final season, although no where near the quality of the first two, does recapture a little of the show's early glory. Mostly because the characters are finally able to move on from the viscious cycles that they seemed to be stuck in for years, often because of their determination to stay together. Sean has long had a desire to leave the superficial plastic sugery business and find more meaningful work, although throughout the series' run he had always found himself sucked into the debauchery and phoniness of the people around him. Christian seems to finally just be able to accept himself for who he is - a successful, handsome, superficial, and promiscuous playboy. And Julia is finally given the oppotunity to settle down with a stable man who is anyone other than Sean or Christian.<br /><br />The supporting characters don't fare as well as the leads, however. Liz ends up okay, and is finally given the career boost that her capable character long deserved. But Kimber, a woman whose sexual allure had never brought her anything but torment, finds relief only in death. And lost soul Matt's storyline ends in the most bizarre way of all (although entertaining, I'll admit) when the show re-pairs him with the show's best villian, transexual sociopath Eva (Famke Jenson).<br /><br />Overall, the final season served as a fairly dignified send-off to a show that, at it's best, critiqued the dark underbelly of American ego, excess, and desire, and at it's worst, served as a commercial for it.iopath Eva (Famke Jenson).

B002ZG983M|4.0|This film was certainly a pleasant surprise: a smart, funny superhero movie. What a concept!<br /><br />Really, the sharp script sets the tone here, but the acting and direction carry it along as well.<br /><br />Some of the digital effects look a little cheesy, but the headlong pace hustles the viewer past them in a blink.<br /><br />Otherwise the fight scenes are first rate, and little Hit Girl makes Go Go in \\"Kill Bill\\" look like a piker!<br /><br />A great villain, likable hero, and interesting secondary characters all make an impression as well.<br /><br />I have deducted a star only because this DVD has NO extras -- no commentary, making of, casting discussion, nada.<br /><br />This film deserves much better, and with any luck a tenth-anniversary edition will make amends.  I'm sorry I'll have to wait ten years to add this to my collection!
B0013D8LKO|5.0|First thing i want to mention is that if you get the Two Disc Special Edition of Eyes Wide Shut you are getting the UNRATED ORIGINAL VERSION.  I had to research for months before i found out this is the version you want.  Don't piss away your time with the R rated version.  Get this version.  Two is that this may be one of the most confusing of all of Kubrick's works.  Sure there were some questions in The Shining or A Clockwork Orange but this movie is a whole different.  This movie has somewhat of an eerie tone different then his other movies.  You need to watch it a couple of times.  But by no means does that make this a bad movie.  This is the only movie about \\"marriage and staying faithful in a relationship\\" that i will watch.  Kubrick does it very differently then the other stupid movies about this subject.  Nobody would expect a movie about marriage to have a scene in an orgy of an underground cult but Kubrick did it.  Sure its not my favorite Kubrick movie but nonetheless it is very good.  Defiantly worth the $[...]that Amazon charges for it (for a while amazon had it at $[...])
B00000JMQE|5.0|My wife loved this movie but she had it on VHS and it had just worn out due to age and over play. A couple of weeks ago she went to watch it and the movie was a mess so, to surprise her I ordered one on DVD. I was very empressed with how fast it arrived in the mail. She arrived home before me and found the DVD package, of course we had to watch it that night. The quality was great and she is happy. So, thank you very much for the effort and on time delivery.

0060825456|1.0|AVOID AT ALL COSTS!! The original Coraline book with illustrations from Dave McKean is amazing and wonderful. This graphic novel sucks all joy and inspiration from the original. McKean was able to say everything in a handful of illustrations and not only does P. Craig Russell not add a single thing to the story he actually takes away the imagination and visual playfulness.  Buy the original book by Neil Gaiman with illustrations by Dave McKean.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|my younger sister actually told me to read this and at first i wasn't very interested. that only lasted until the first page. i was immediately engrossed in the story with the exciting new world and interesting characters. collins does a superb job making the herione come to life. katnis is a believable herione you can't  help but root for.  i would suggest this book to anyone who loves a good story of good vs. evil.
B00395ZYVS|5.0|I didn't want this book to end.  I felt a connection to each of the women characters, and all the men felt like people I had met in my life.

0143038419|4.0|Through reading this book, I learned so much about life, spirituality, relationships and self-discovery. Gilbert's descriptions of food and location are beautiful. She has a gift with words, and I found myself saying aloud, \\"How did she come up with THAT sentence?\\" I laughed out loud at various quotes and self-reflections. I found myself underlining statements written by Gilbert as well as quotations shared by other \\"characters\\" in the book. There is so much to be learned about self and others in this memoir. I can't stop thinking about this book, and as a result of reading it, I've begun my own quest to find myself, and especially, my spirituality.     This is not to say that the whole book was an easy read . . . there was a section in the middle during which I wanted to put the book down -- I was frustrated with the spiritual \\"mumbo jumbo\\" and things that seemed a little kooky. But when I let that go and realized this is the author's experience, not my own, I ended up pulled right back into the prose. I know friends who couldn't get through this (possibly becoming frustrated at the same spot where I almost put down the book), and what a shame. This is definitely worth plugging through the less pleasurable sections because, overall, it is a life-changing read.
B002ZG983M|5.0|This movie was pitch perfect for me. The opening scene with the super hero on top of the building set just the right tone.

9889979942|5.0|First of all, I'd like to say that China: Portrait of a People has given me a wide-ranging view of a country I barely knew before reading this book.  It would be difficult for the average person to go and see the multitude of things, people and places that Tom Carter has brought to us in his book.   If I never go to China, it will have left me knowing China as well as anyone could have by reading a book, although, China: Portrate of a People has made me want to go there and see some of what was in the book and possibly other things.  Having lived in two other East Asian countries, the book has spawned a new interest for my next Asian destination. I have used it as a reference source to help me decide which part of China to steer toward or avoid.  Photographic style shows an eye for colour, texture and patterns; good use of lines and patterns depicting buildings. Tom captures what could be considered mundane and intrigues the viewer with his vivid photos. There is an obvious knack in dealing with people and thus eliciting photos of them.  Most of the photos were daytime shots avoiding the superficial nature of artificial light of nighttime shots.  It is well organized into 5 main regions in the table of contents and there are very useful point-of-reference maps at the beginning of each province.  The book comes to life with its provocative content that illustrates and discusses the social fabric of China thoroughly; from economic, demographic facts to historical plugs to contemporary street-level trends. The writing is succinct and flows well.

B0036TGSR6|1.0|As mentioned by previous reviewers, it's hard to take this movie serious since Google Search is the prime means of solving the mystery. Also, the ending is anticlimactic, and more of a cop out than anything else.

B0015DROBO|2.0|As I've grown older, I've become harder to please through books, movies, and television.  I know \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" is an international bestseller; however, I hated it and cannot recommend it.<br /><br />The No. 1 reason I hated the book is because most of the descriptions are tedious. Here are two examples: Check out the description of Salanders's new Apple computer in chapter 11; then turn to the description of Millennium's office space in chapter 18. Can reasonable people truly be entertained by the following?<br /><br />\\"Millennium's offices were arranged in an L shape. The entry was a hall that took up a lot of space without being able to be put to much use. There were two sofas there, so it was by way of being a reception area. Beyond was a lunchroom kitchenette, then cloakroom/toilets, and two storage rooms with bookshelves and filing cabinets. There was also a desk for an intern. To the right of the entry was the glass wall of Malm's studio, which took up about 500 square feet, with its own entrance from the landing. To the left was the editorial office, encompassing about 350 square feet, with the windows facing Gotgatan.\\"<br /><br />The No. 2 reason I hated the book is because I'm not convinced Harriet could disappear in the way she did, and I'm not convinced who the murderer is and how he became a serial killer.<br /><br />As I said at the beginning, as I get older, I've become harder to please in all forms of entertainment. I believe this is because I've read or seen every type of plot invented by humankind. To entertain me now I want excellent writing and realistic and complicated characters.
B0000041DF|4.0|I've been listening to Argerich's Rach 3 quite a bit over the past week. I enjoy it and would recommend people check out this album, but I have to agree that at times it just comes off as way too fast. The ironic thing is that when Argerich explodes through the third movement, it feels less passionate than normal tempo. Almost more a clinical exercise in speed rather than being swept up in the moment.    In any case, this album is worth getting just to get a sense of Argerich's amazing technical prowess. She is one of the most skilled pianists I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. Certainly one of the greatest pianists of the 20th century, and we're lucky to have so many excellent recordings from her.    For another excellent, albeit more traditional, Rach 3 check out Ashkenazy's 1963 recording with Anatole Fistoulari and the London Symphony Orchestra. It's available here on Amazon -- it is the CD with both the Rach 2 (Moscow Philharmonic) and Rach 3 on it. If I'm listening to relax and enjoy the music, that's the album I'd choose over this one.

B003L45JLW|5.0|If you have even the slighest appeal to Tom Petty's music, you will love this album. He and hs band really rock and there is a good quality of songs throughout the entire album. The band is tight as usual but sometimes some of the individual guitar solo's or duets really shine. The huge 'bonus' of this release is its high quality recording and release on blu ray. I trully hope that more musicians appreciate the capacity and opportunity that this medium provides. The extra is worth it - ie a free download of the entire album for portable playing. I highly recommend this album - it is the tops of my play list.

B001AQO3QA|3.0|I love the original Alien (10/10) and Aliens (9/10).  The original was the first R-rated movie I ever watched, and it holds a special place in my heart.  Alien 3 and Resurrection are two of the worst sequels ever made, however I haven't seen the extended versions that are included in this set.  This box set has two amazing movies with a ton of features, but I have one major flaw with it.  This set is way overpriced as are many newer BR releases.  I think $60 would be pushing it, but almost $100 is insane for movies that everyone already owns with features that we've already seen.  Amazon is usually good about prices which makes me think that this set is extremely pricy elsewhere.  I'm only 14, so I can't afford pricy sets like this.  I really shouldn't be double dipping as much as I do for the amount of money I have.  Anyway, to sum things up in one sentence: This is a really great set that I will be glad to purchase if I can find it for $50 or cheaper because $90 something is just ludicrous.
B002UXRGM0|5.0|We got Life a couple of months ago, and it has provided hours of high-quality entertainment for the entire family. We view it on a large-screen Samsung LCD TV and the picture quality is amazing! The camera work, the editing, the choice of themes, as well as the narration are amazing! The animals and insects leap to life, the plants allure you to their world, and the underwater creatures reveal themselves like you would never see them without this top-notch production. Totally riveting!
B000HEWEDK|5.0|I am very impressed with the way this product purchase went.  I ordered the DVD and expected it to take 4 to 5 days before delivery. It arrived in 3 days with no issues.  I played the video the day I recieved the movie and did not have any problems with the disc.
0756405890|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me and after buying it, it sat on my self for weeks as I finished off books from authors I knew and loved already like Brandon Sanderson or Jacqueline Carey.    Once I started reading it, I could not put this book down. Rothfuss has a knack for making seemingly innocuous situations interesting. His world is like many high fantasy worlds (post middle-ages feel), but with his own unique spin. His concept of magic feels original and provides it's own constraints to keep it from being the ultimate solution to every problem (as some fantasy authors tend to make it).    The story-within-a-story method gives a nice genuine feeling as the narrator interjects little self-corrections to small details in his story or musings on how he acted in various childhood situations.    The characters start out seemingly unbelievable or too-good-to-be-true, but as the story unfolds, their humanity comes through and the characters become easy to relate to and quite likable.    My only complaint is that the second book to this series has not been published yet. I have since tabled two different fantasy books I had started reading before starting Name of the Wind; I could not help but compare them to this book - both fell drastically short.    This book has easily propelled Rothfuss to one of my top three favorite fantasy authors, sharing the mantel with the likes of George R.R. Martin and Brandon Sanderson. I anxiously await the next installment of this series and I strongly recommend this book to anyone that truly appreciates high fantasy.

1597801585|5.0|\\"What took you so long to pick it up?\\" I did not believe the hype.<br /><br />Before The Windup Girl, my exposure to Bacigalupi's work was through two short stories:<br /><br />(1) \\"The People of Sand and Slag\\"--which seemed to pop-up everywhere for a while; and then<br />(2) \\"Yellow Card Man\\"--which was in the same milieu as this novel and which I liked but which I didn't really \\"get\\" because I was expecting something more along the lines of \\"The People of Sand and Slag\\".<br /><br />This is not to say that I did not enjoy Bacigalupi's work at least on some level--they were both good stories but neither of them was enough to send me out on a mission looking to read more of his work. Nevertheless, I recognized the name and had this strong flicker of recognition every time yet another review appeared in my RSS reader. The Windup Girl is amazing and a shoe-in for at least one of 2009's big awards and so forth. But I kept thinking about \\"The People of Sand and Slag\\".<br /><br />Turns out that Bacigalupi has the same problem that I (\\"...would like to think I...\\") have.<br /><br />His ideas are big. Too big for some crummy 5000 word short story or some 8500 word novelette. Those ideas are big and they are important and they need room to breathe. Those ideas need a 350+ page apparatus to fully get themselves across. But these big ideas all seem so small and slow at first, and for the first 50-100 pages you find yourself thinking So what? So this is an interesting and immersive milieu but where's the action? Why is everyone ready to have this book's babies? But then it hits you hard and drags you through 250 more stunning pages. But now I'm just gushing?<br /><br />I loved this book the way that I loved Ian McDonald's [[ASIN:1591025958 River of Gods]]. There is something very special about the rich tapestry that these guys have created by putting these futuristic settings against the lush and visceral backdrops of these oriental locales with all their poverty and banalia. But whereas McDonald did it with AIs in India, Bacigalupi is doing it with genetically modified human not-quite-clones in Thailand.<br /><br />But what makes this one so special is that everyone is under indictment and nothing is sacrosanct. None of the stories end the way you would want them to, but you cannot think of any other way that they could end. This is one that will haunt you, and makes a great companion read for [[ASIN:0385721676 Oryx and Crake]].Bacigalupi is doing it with genetically modified human not-quite-clones in Thailand.

B001PPLJIQ|5.0|Great book.  Great Movie.  Deep storyline. One of my all time favourites.  Both Kate Winslet and the young actor are phenomenal.
B002ZG9828|1.0|To begin, please understand two things about me:<br /><br />1: I Love Westerns.<br />2: I`ve been a fan of the character 'Jonah Hex' for over 30 years.<br /><br />In the comics, Jonah Hex caught my interest because of the gritty, hard-edged stories that featured a tough ex-Confederate soldier turned hard-case Bounty Hunter roaming the old West. I won`t belabor the details, but if you want a good idea of the tone of Jonah Hex; most fans liken Clint Eastwood`s \\"The Outlaw Josie Wales\\" to practically be a Jonah Hex movie. Jonah Hex would indeed ask the immortal question \\"You Gonna Pull Those Pistols, Or Whistle Dixie?\\"<br /><br />The movie \\"Jonah Hex\\", while somewhat capturing the charaacter`s 'Attitude', unfortunately sees fit to muck it up with supernatural underpinnings and the sort of gimmickry that James West would laugh at ( ...I mean...c`mon...twin Gatling Guns mounted on a saddle? ...a gun that shoots lit sticks of dynamite ?? )<br /><br />Jonah Hex --the character -- was NEVER about gadgets and gimmicks, or Bringing The Dead Back To Life for Q&A sessions.<br /><br />It`s painfully obvious that the makers of this movie were too timid to risk a straight, hard-edged WESTERN, so they basically threw in everything they could think of to please a teen-age audience ...and created A MESS.<br /><br />Now, I do enjoy so-called 'Steampunk' --The afformentioned 'The Wild Wild West' tv series is a good example--but the storyline of  Jonah Hex The Character just was never about Steampunk.<br /><br />Neither does the character require supernatural powers to be interesting.<br /><br />This film has been compared to Sonnenfeld`s 1999 \\"Wild Wild West\\", which managed to take a successful tv series and ruin virtually every aspect that made it a hit. It`s a common trend in Hollywood: \\"Let`s make a movie of a fan-favorite tv series and change things\\"....The changes of course are \\"To make it more appealing to a broader audience\\" ... So the logic is that you want to cash in on a pop classic and yet alter it so that the very people who enjoyed it enough to make it a pop classic will be disgusted ?<br />Hey--Hollywood knows best what people will like...right?<br /><br />The real tragedy here is that, like James West; Jonah Hex has now been ruined for The Big Screen and likely  will never get another shot at that venue.<br /><br />Of course, film-makers in Hollywood these days have long since  lost all faith in the Western genre.  It`s too bad...Great characters create fans by being appealing, by being...great. The movie \\"Jonah Hex\\" was a twisted take on a great character; twisted to suit the perceived tastes of teenagers who supposedly would not like a solid Western character.<br /><br />Well....I was a teenager when I became a Jonah Hex fan.nough to make it a pop classic will be disgusted ?   Hey--Hollywood knows best what people will like...right?

0307473465|5.0|This story is deep and full of raw emotion at it's best. Interesting twists that make you think.<br /><br />The book came like new and was cheap so those are both pluses.  Would buy from seller again.
B0015DROBO|4.0|Once you read the first one and realize there are two more- you will want to keep reading.  The first one was good, the second one was better.  I just started the third.  I like the characters and the theme that runs through the book which in my opinion is corruption from on top and the ones who pay the price is not all that uncommon.  I always tend to root for the \\"underdog\\"!
B001DJ7PR8|3.0|To start with, I happen to love this movie.  I won't summarize the plot, as many reviews have already done so.  It's visually appealing, witty, intelligent, and relatable.  I've watched it many times.<br /><br />The film would get five stars, but I'm removing two for the product itself.  It's copy protected, which I didn't see anywhere in the product description.  I understand that they don't want the movie pirated, fair enough -- but as someone who does most of my TV and movie watching on a computer screen, now I'll have to pirate a copy just to watch this movie at any time when I don't happen to be near a DVD player.  Most of the other young people I know also usually watch movies on their laptops and it's frustrating when the industry totally ignores their customers' lifestyles and needs like this.  I wouldn't have paid for this movie if I had known I couldn't watch it on my computer.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|I am suprised that this band is from the UK...the sound is very un-UK.  I like that.  A band not afraid to take a chance on the folk/rock/alt sound.  I think this band has a similar guise to Kings of Leon but for some reason I like this Mumford way better mainly because after one listen they ARE better.  I think it is that the voice is more pleasent than Kings all the while still sounding very unique as does the Kings singer. All the songs remind me of great stories.  I like an album when the songs actually have something to say, and this is an album with a lot to say.
B003TZ9EGO|5.0|i was suprised at how good the remix album was b/c most remix album suck but from just dance to dance in the dark the album easily enjoyable a must get for all Monsters
B003O85W3A|4.0|Arcade Fire: I have been with them from the begining.  I love everything they have released to date....but this album in particular is my favorite.  This album is different, but still sounds like AF.  I think it is a little more upbeat, a little more....grown up, a little more beautiful.   I love the fact that this album is 64 min (16 songs) in lengeth and yet still all the songs are great....latley a lot of artist are putting out longer albums with 16-20 songs total and 6-8 of those songs suck...that is not the case here...well done gang.
0312330529|3.0|If you'd asked me around page 600 I'd've given this book 5 stars. Up to then the main character, an Australian living on the lam, is acclimating himself to the slums of Bombay. It's fantastic. I could ignore the attempts to describe the girlfriend -- those passages were weak but I gave the author credit for showing us a failure of the main character, his poor ability to describe his indescribable love which made him seem sympathetic. And the weighty metaphors I let slide since there was so much else that was working well. But when the character leaves the slum and joins forces with the mafia, taken under the wing of a philosopher-thug don, that's where things fell apart. The action was there and just as readable, but now we're supposed to think about good and evil and take seriously the thoughts of a man who on one hand says killing is never right but then has no second thoughts about killing for his own ends. And if our main character loves this guy so much that he sees him as a father figure, what am I to think about the main character? Is he reliable? Is he trustworthy? Do I like him? With more than 900 pages to spend with him, I'd like to like Lin. But after finishing it, watching Lin head off yet again in the service of the mob to do its violent business, I'm not sure I can like this guy or trust him.      Here's the thing: it's The Godfather recast in Bombay. The difference is that while Michael Corleone's absorption into the family business was compelling as he discovers his sense of honor to his father and his family and how he finally takes his place as the leader of the mob family, we never get a sense that Shantaram's main character, Lin, really feels strongly about anything, much less being a criminal. He tries to separate himself from the other criminals noting that the difference is that they've killed and he never has. Is that enough? He's stabbed and hit and pummeled people all through the book. That they didn't die is a credit to him?  It's a fine line to draw and I'm not sure most readers would find it enough.    I'll simply say that if you're looking for a readable book to get you through a long summer or cold winter,  I'd recommend it with reservations. If you want a glimpse of India, a true unadulterated view without the heavy-handed philosophical, metaphor-laden, mafia-thuggery, read A Fine Balance by Rohinton Mistry. A great book. Unqualified recommendation.

0307454541|4.0|The book is fairly preposterous, but it's an exciting and enjoyable read.  Its biggest asset is its creative plot and excellent characterization. Negatives include the outrageous Wonder Woman attributes of the title character, plus the author's use of every cliched trick in the book to move the plot forward. And there was more than enough gore to please you, if that's your thing.  Yet, once I overlooked all that nonsense, I just relaxed and enjoyed the book, like so many other readers.  Also, I was pleased that Larsson managed to keep his left-wing beliefs fairly under control (according to Wikipedia he was a card-carrying communist) until the very last pages when, like a good commie, he blames every societal problem on the gnomes of the stockmarket and .... wait for it....THE MEDIA!  Oh well, it is what it is.  I've already ordered the next book in the Millenium series and look forward to another rollicking read.
B0036EH3TS|5.0|Great movie I've been waiting for a blu ray of this movie. Now I've got it. Two thumbs up.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|I'VE SEEN ALL OF THE TWILIGHT SAGA MOVIES AT LEAST TWICE. I AGREE THAT THE FIRST TWO WERE NOT AS GOOD AS ECLIPSE. ECLIPSE WAS ALWAYS MY FAVORITE BOOK ALSO.,I WAS EXPECTING IT TO BE EXTRA GOOD. AND IT DIDN'T DISAPPOINT ME IN THE LEAST. I PLAN TO SEE THIS MOVIE OVER AND OVER. I JUST HOPE THEY DON'T MAKE THE MISTAKE OF LEAVING ALOT OF THE MATERIAL OUT OF BREAKING DAWN. IT IS A LONG AND COMPLICATED PART OF THE WHOLE STORY. AND I BELEIVE STEPHANIE COULD WRITE MORE ALONG THOSE LINES AND CONTINUE ON WHERE SHE LEFT OFF. IT WOULD BE GREAT TO READ MORE ABOUT BELLA'S AFTER LIFE AND THE GROWTH OF THE OTHER CHARACTERS SUCH AS RENESEME AND SOME OF THE OTHERS WHO COME INTO THIS PART OF THE BOOK. THE CHILD IN THIS BOOK IS SUCH A DELIGHT. I WOULD LOVE TO READ MORE ABOUT HER ESPECIALLY. I THINK THIS IS THE BEST MOVIE OF THE SERIES SO FAR!!
0783225849|5.0|\\"Psycho\\" is one of the oldest most successful horror films of all-time. \\"Psycho\\" was made in an era where horror films focused on the plot rather the gore. Director Alfred Hitchcock created and turned \\"Psycho\\" into a classic hit.    \\"Psycho\\" is about Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) a business worker, who is asked by her boss to take a large sum of money and deposit it into the bank. Instead of following orders, Marion decides to keep the money for herself and get out of town. After driving for a long time, she decides to stop at the bates motel for the night. She meets the owner of the hotel Norman Bates. While showering, Bates's mother kills Marion.   After not hearing or seeing Marion, her sister and boyfriend decided to go investigate the bates motel.       \\"Psycho\\" is a classic film that will be remembered for decades to come.
B001LYD2JU|5.0|I bought this album in the early 80's on vinyl and wore it out! i even wore out the casstte too! This is a strong record from start to finish...it showcases all of Michael Schenker's talents...his lead work & his solos. Although every one of his records (even his Scorpions & UFO days) are strong releases, this is the best out of all of them. i highly recommend this for anyone who is into guitar oriented heavy rock & as the perfect album for those that are just getting into Schenker......it is a must have!

B0021L8V0M|5.0|Angelina Jolie's acting has often been overshadowed by her marriage. Anyone who has viewed Changeling or Girl, interrupted, has obviously witnessed her great range in different and equally challenging roles. However, at the end of the day, she and her husband are viewed as mere celebrities-not different than reality stars-than serious actors. She has long affirmed her place among the great actresses of the last decade, but her public persona has often overshadowed her career. Salt is proof that even in the Hollywood blockbuster, she is as versatile as one can be.<br /><br />In the beginning of the film, we view CIA agent Evelyn Salt, played by Jolie, being tortured by North Korean authorities. Due to a miraculous trade between the Americans and North Koreans, she is freed to return home. Not long after her arrival in her country, she comes in contact with a Russian defector who informs of a deadly operation named \\"Day: X.\\" Planned since the onset of the Cold War, the execution of this plan will mean the end of the United States. Possibly indicative of its execution is his testament that the Russian President will die at the funeral of the American Vice-President. Salt is a throwback to those classic films, notably The Manchurian Candidate, which focused on the conflicts and animosity between the two countries. This film may seem quite dated, as the cold war and the most notable of the two nation's conflicts seems to have ended, but it focuses on current times and events, implicating that the animosity of many Russians have yet to end. They are still training operatives, from childhood, and releasing them within the United States and awaiting the best time to take action.<br /><br />Fortunately, this \\"Day: X\\" does not seem to be under the control of the Russian authorities, but old men of the Cold War era who want to put an end to the US. As politically correct as possible, the film avoids introducing the motives behind \\"Day: X.\\" Is this a war against democracy, the current US president, or generally do these men enjoy seeing this superpower feel threatened for a change? Such claims are never addressed, keeping the film quite light in ideology and philosophy. For the sake of argument, let's suppose the mastermind of the plan simply hates all that is American about the US and needs to wipe this country of the map to rest easily. The film is Hollywood entertainment that simply wants to suppose that America has enemies for some very vague and unknown reasons, despite its efforts to spread \\"peace\\" across the globe.<br /><br />The film will invariably will be compared to the Manchurian Candidate for its countless twists. That classic film is obviously of enormous social and historical importance, but both are fascinatingly deceptive in toying around with the audience's perception of the main characters. For some time, Salt shows infinite amount of courage in alienating its American audience by showcasing the success of the Russians in causing havoc in the United States; some may even see parts of the film, before the major revelation as hugely anti-American. Seeing this in a packed theater, I did sense some anger or tension from fellow viewers. It was the unbelievable sense of betrayal from a film that took pleasure in lambasting and lampooning the secret service, or the ease by which the Russians were able to overcome all the security barriers and harm such powerful diplomats. Of course, Hollywood would never want to cause a stir by showing an incident that may mirror 9/11, and display a more wide scale target and tragedy. No, that would be thoughtful and somewhat depressive, and studios have a strong disdain for portraying the foreseeable, yet unfortunate, future-they would rather fill our heads with countless post apocalyptic junk. Sure, the film eventually loses its fire in relation to its intriguing post-cold war analysis of the relation between these two nations, but for a blockbuster even such an attempt is admirable. Salt does not have an actual agenda in regards to the relations of Russia and US at present, but it cleverly uses the elements of the old cold war films, many which were propaganda products, to tell its tale. If the film actually had been faithful to its vision, it would have initiated an abundant amount of controversy for this film; controversy that really would not aid the film in any shape or form.<br /><br />The real loser, overall, is Tom Cruise who lost the role to Jolie-as it was later rewritten for her. Choosing Jolie was a wise move, considering that a female character more successfully balances out the tension and anger of the media and the appreciation of her Russian comrades. A female character can convey better her loyalty and betrayal for each side, without seeming as sinister and excessively callous. Jolie really deserves more challenging role, such as those which Kate Winslet seems to always attain, but she still gives a dedicated performance. It is quite bewildering that we feel sorry for her misfortunes, but later grow to dislike her as her true colors begin to show. She picks exactly the right tone for her performance, caring, emotional, and superficially honest. Jolie brings the unexpected masculinity to the film that is quite unexpected of her. Such films are often reserved for butch male actors, and often bodybuilders, such as Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Bruce Willis, and Jean Claude Van Damme, but Jolie proves that actresses can bring much needed likeability and vulnerability to the role. Salt eventually lags near the ending-in regards to the realism of its Russian-US relations and the outcome of Evelyn's crimes and their belated revelation-but considering its conception as a Hollywood blockbuster, it is surprisingly fresh and a winner.al agenda in regards to the relations of Russia and US at present, but it cleverly uses the elements of the old cold war films, many which were propaganda products, to tell its tale.

B0015DROBO|5.0|one of the best books ive ever read. started off slow but besides that its awesome
B001PPLIEG|4.0|The first of the two things are the fights are getting a tad...unrealistic.  I felt sorry for the car in the first scene and the hotel in the last part of the movie.  Also, Agent Fields.  Check out her first name in the credits.  But enough of that.  The rest of the movie is perfect and why?  Because Daniel Craig is the best James Bond up to date.<br />His manner of speech, his walk, the style of his fighting.  He is a mean SOB, who plans to survive and will do anything to kill you.  He is not nice and he isn't fair, and he rarely uses a pun or cracks a bad joke when somebody dies.  He IS still the 007 from the books and as long as they allow him to stay that way I will continue to watch the films when they come out in the theater and will continue to buy the DVDs when they are released.<br />The DVD has the trailers and the music video, but the movie is the reason to buy it.  Used or new, get it.
B002B55XGI|5.0|What constitutes an exceptional memoir? Getting by my own opinions and beliefs to get at the author's personal truth!  Lone Survivor's no nonsense tone, from the start, was one I learned to appreciate. Long before the thick of the book Luttrell took his time detailing what attracted him to the SEALs, and how he handled the rigorous training. Very well done. Ordinarily an opening like this may have been a struggle to read, except Luttrell does a superb job immersing readers cogently into understanding SEAL work lending us his eyes. I couldn't close the book.<br /><br />When it was time for Redwing to move I stayed engaged, again cautioned against debating decisions and motives, and even the outcome, as there was another voice speaking so loudly through those clouds, I would have missed it had I done so. There's no debating here, choked up as I was, almost too sure this voice was the same voice, particularly during the elevating defining moments, making those calls. Whether left or right, up or down, this is an exceptional personal truth. Amazing. Simply, phenomenally amazing.<br /><br />A moving must read about some very Honorable men.
032147404X|2.0|No, wait. Fooled you! That was a just a cheap headline to draw you into my review. But don't worry, I'll discuss ghosts in a moment....    I will admit that I did not buy this book. I was looking for a good introductory book for my talented young nephew, but I knew he wouldn't get past the terrible writing and truly stupid, incessant \\"oh, just kidding!\\" lines like the ones I am mocking here. The tips seem legitimate, but rather than photographing ghosts, I would suggest a ghost writer. (Get it? Do you see what I did there? I started out with a \\"ghost\\" reference, but then I cleverly turned it around to mean something else!)

The discussion of the ethics of consuming animal products is well thought out.

B000GY729M|5.0|So, my dad bought this album about a year ago, and he thought I would like it, so he let me put it on my iPod. It was my first time really listening to The Killers. The first time I listened to it, I didn't really know what to think. I listened to it again, and it started to grow on me. If you should happen to buy ANY album by The Killers, buy this one. The music is really good, and you won't be disappointed. But hey, they're The Killers, what do you expect? :)
1435248244|5.0|When i heard the title of the book, I automatically assumed it would be some drama.  I assumed it would contain some silly teenage girls who would fight over something stupid.  Boy, was I surprised.  Right from the first paragraph the action starts.  Tally Youngblood is just an average girl in a not so average world.  This book was completely refreshing and gutsy as opposed to all the vampire and other books floating around.  I highly recommend this book!
B0035J6TAI|4.0|4 1/2 Stars (originally 3-1/2 Stars)<br />I had to update my review because I've had these songs in my head for the last several days. Indeed, this album is definitely a \\"grower\\" as another reviewer put it. It's really growing on me.<br /><br />~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised by this Peter Gabriel album.<br /><br />Perhaps it's because I had such low expectations after seeing ahead of time (and reading some of) the negative reviews on Amazon. Or, possibly it's because the covers that were selected were very eclectic. I'd never heard some of these songs before.<br /><br />Taken for what it is, an experiment in what Peter Gabriel calls in the liner notes \\"some of my favourite songs and focus more on being the interpreter than the creator\\", this is actually a very strong record. It contains some really terrific interpretations and arrangements along with a few duds.<br /><br />At first, what is so refreshing about this record is that only acoustic instruments are used. It does not contain any manipulated sound or synthesizers that have dominated the last several PG albums. I'd love it if the next album of PG original songs only used acoustic instruments instead of electronic instruments. This album proves that he can create an atmosphere without the crutch of technology.<br /><br />My biggest complaint over the last several PG albums was that they began to feel homogenized. On this record, he's wisely chosen to throw away the crutch of technology. The acoustic arrangements here create atmospheres equally or much arresting than anything he's recorded previously.<br /><br />This is a good thing because many of these tracks seem to hearken back to early Peter Gabriel albums and in some cases very-early Genesis.<br /><br />\\"Apres Moi\\", \\"Mirrorball\\" and \\"Flume\\" (by Regina Spektor, Elbow and Bon Iver, respectively) go for the throat, bringing back the haunt and horror that were essential sensibilities of \\"The Intruder\\" and \\"The Rhythm of the Heat\\" from PG's 'Melt' and 'Security' albums.<br /><br />His version of Arcade Fire's \\"My Body is a Cage\\" almost made me want to cheer; reminding me of \\"Where the Sour Turns to Sweet\\" one of the earliest tracks that Peter Gabriel recorded as a member of Genesis (and a personal favorite).<br /><br />But the real standouts are the songs with the most surprises. His take on \\"Listening Wind\\" by Talking Heads and David Bowie's anthemic \\"Heroes\\" are creative revelations.<br /><br />My favorite track on the record is \\"The Book of Love\\" by The Magnetic Fields. It perfectly captures the creepy undercurrent reminiscent of the original. The tone of the backup vocals are perfectly cast by the surprising appearance of Peter Gabriel's daughter, Melanie.<br /><br />The weakest tracks fail to improve upon the original. Such is the case with \\"I Think It's Going to Rain Today\\". But that may be due to my own bias against Randy Newman, whose music drives me nuts because it all sounds alike in my view.<br /><br />The slow tempo is the primary reason that PG's version \\"Street Spirit (Fade Out)\\" by Radiohead falls flat. It lacks the pace and tries too hard to match the drama of the original.<br /><br />Overall, the album exudes a unique \\"vibe\\" that I haven't felt on a PG album in ages. In some places I felt like I was listening to Bj&ouml;rk during the period of her \\"Homogenic\\" album. In others, it was more like Kronos Quartet on their \\"Pieces of Africa\\" release.

B0030IIZ4M|5.0|This timeless classic continues to entertain and its popularity has returned with the release of the new movie.  Even my three-year-old and two-year-old appreciate and enjoy it.
B001ECQ4AS|5.0|I am ecstatic with the Blu-ray DVD of SUPERNATURAL'S first season and thrilled at the discount I got through Amazon.  I will always deal with Amazon if given the chance!

0307346617|4.0|Since there are already 700 reviews of this book on Amazon, I'll keep mine short (pro/con list style)    Pros:    -Sci-fi geek masturbatory material at its finest.  A wide cast of characters describe their encounters with the undead and the tools & weapons they use to fight off the \\"zedheads\\".  The book is about 50% technical and scientific information that readers of Clancy will go nuts over.    -While purposely vague in areas, WWZ is a comprehensive guide to the anatomy and methodology of zombie behavior and kill tactics.  Pretty thorough.    -The book's strong socioeconomic themes are well thought out and carefully executed based on real history and governments.  It is a very plausible simulation of world reaction to such an outbreak.    Cons:    -Although the title reads \\"An Oral History...\\", nothing about this book reads like oral interviews.  The characters often have the same grammar, cadence, and vocabulary, and their \\"speech\\" is too novelized to appear authentic in any way.  By novelized I mean it is too contrived and lyrical at times to emulate real speech patterns.  For me, this was the major flat point about the book.    -There is no real story here.  There are many portions of stories, but none of them develop into anything greater than excerpts.  Yes, there is a timeline but that's about as deep as it goes.    -The emotions of the characters don't quite seem authentic or severe enough given the circumstances.  Part of that may be due to the fact that no single character gets enough story time.    -------  As a book: entertaining enough as a dry field report, but not emotionally jarring enough to be realistic as a war memoir.    As a movie (already in development): probably going to be a 2012-like bomb.  No character development, no real backbone.  But that's why CGI was invented.    As a video game: probably the most successful platform available for this hodgepodge of episodes, and I personally can't wait to play if one ever comes out.

B000002JSR|3.0|After the death of john Bonham in 1980, fans of led zeppelin had come to the realization that the band was dead. Now imagine their joy(or shock) when they saw this album sitting on shelves 2 years later. In 1982, Jimmy Page returned to the studio to gather previously unused tracks on one convenient record. Now, I believe that most unreleased tracks are unreleased for a reason. This record holds true to my philosophy. Most of the outtakes are from I and In through the outdoor, with one from III, one from Houses of the holy and a track from the Montreaux sessions with Page and Bonham.   The album opens with a bang playing \\"We're gonna groove\\", a song zeppelin often opened with live. I believe this version comes from Albert hall in 1970. A decent yet largely forgettable track.   Track two, \\"Poor Tom\\" my personal favourite, Is taken as an outtake from III. Has a guitar part reminiscent of \\"Bron yr aur\\" from physical graffiti, and a killer harmonica solo at the end.   Track 3 \\"I can't quit you baby\\" is a live version of the track from I. Has a lot more energy than the studio version in my opinion. The guitar solo almost justifies the album's purchase. This version is also taken from Albert hall in 1970.   Track 4, \\"Walters walk\\" sounds similar to some of Robert plant's solo work and is an outtake from Houses of the holy. Not a bad song so to speak, but one or two listens will satisfy you. Plants voice is quite good actually, and compliments Jimmy's playing really well. In the end though, it's forgettable, but the title of worst song has to go to the next song on the album.   Ozone baby has no tune to speak of and captures the worst of Plants wailing banshee like voice. Completely forgettable and generic. Not to mention It's just annoying through and through. The part near the end where Plants voice is distorted purposely is enough to make me want to take a power drill to my temple. This is one of the ITTOD outtakes.   The next song, \\"Darlene\\", is much better and is moreidentifiable as being a zeppelin song. Another ITTOD outtake, this one features more of JPJ's piano influence, a defining feature of ITTOD. I can still see why it was cut though as it is generic at times and there better ways to fill the album.   \\"Bonzo's montreaux\\", was recorded during the montreaux sessions and is probably one of the better songs. A much better drum solo than moby dick, \\"Bonzo's Montreaux\\", uses steel drums giving the solo an actual tune at various points in the song. Beginning slow and simple, it soon bursts into a frenzy of percussion, worthy of any studio album. Recorded in Montreaux(duh) in late 1976, this song would actually have fit into presence quite well in retrospect. The last song \\"wearing and tearing\\" is likely the most punk like song zeppelin ever recorded with the frantic chord mangling found in punk and metal. Without any recognizable solo and a real dark feel to it, I can't say I genuinely like it, but to be fair zeppelin hasn't done anything else similar to it. An admirable way to end the album and is a song any other band would be proud of.     The problem with this album aren't really the tracks themselves, but the lack of tracks. I find it very hard to believe that in ten years of recording these were all there unused outtakes. Where are the unissued songs from the early BBC sessions? Another gripe I have is is the lack of \\"Hey, Hey what can I do\\" a song released parallel \\"I can't quit you baby\\". Why the latter is included instead baffles me. What's even stranger is the album clocks in at only 33 minutes leaving a lot of time for extra tracks. For an album composed of outtakes it's strange some tracks weren't considered good enough.     I want to recommend this album fully, but I think I too fall into the category of it being best suited for collectors, or if you're like me, completionists. It's goes without saying to not get this first.  Suggested tracks: Poor Tom, I can't quit you baby, Bonzos Montreaux  Tracks to avoid: Ozone baby
0061714372|5.0|I began to devour this book while waiting in line to meet Dave and have him sign my copy at a book signing in Toronto last week.  Very quickly it was evident this memoir is written from a place of candor, humor, humility and honesty that I was both surprised at and appreciative of.  After all, the Dave Mustaine of my youth was a balsy mouthpiece with a sneer that could send you running for the hills and melt your heart at once (if you were an impressionable teenaged girl who loved Metal that is).<br /><br />This memoir is like having a conversation with a friend.  The stories shared don't come across from a place of bragging or boasting, but from a place of experience, and sometimes veer into quite emotional and serious areas.  Luckily though some tales told can also be both crude and funny at once, and it really feels like the words are falling from Dave's own lips.  I found it a very deeply insightful look into both an amazing creature and a flawed man, he's human just like the rest of us. Huh, who knew?  In the epic percieved battle of Megadeth vs. Metallica I think everyone will enjoy this look into both Dave's life and his thought process.  I was a Metallica fan for many years, with only brief flirts of Megadeth in my musical landscape.  Reading this memoir has absolutely made me a bigger fan of Mustaine and his life's work.....Megadeth.
030726999X|4.0|This is the third book in a crime suspense trilogy, and like the first two it is a very good summer read!<br />I do not usually read this genre, but the books are so well written is is hard to put them down.<br />The series deserves to be made into a movie trilogy, better than the Swedish film that just came out for The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.
B001VNB54A|4.0|I mirror the same comments of those who found it hard to connect with the characters portrayed in The Pacific.  But, at the end of the series, unlike Band of Brothers, I think the mission of the mini-series was to portray the misery of the war in the Pacific as the main \\"character\\".  For that, I think the work hit the mark.  But personally speaking, what made Band of Brothers one of my all time favorites was the sense of connection with all of the characters while portraying the good and bad of war.  I do look forward for the release of the BD as I cannot wait to hear it in a more lossless format.
B002WY65VU|5.0|If you love Zombies...loved Sean of the Dead...then you will love this American style Zombie flick.  The casting was well done...Woody was PERFECT in his role.  Everyone did a great job, and what I really loved about the film, I can't say cuz it will give the ending away...let me say that it's different from any other Zombie film I've ever seen and I loved it!<br /><br />It made me laugh, which is hard thing for a Zombie film to do, well, other than Sean of the Dead, of course.  It was just a fun film, a little ridiculous, a little contrived, but I LOVED it anyway.  I think you will too.

0815411839|2.0|Overall, this book was well written.  It provides exhaustive detail about many aspects of Marilyn Monroe's life.  The author's conclusions about her death are plausible, even convincing.    On the other hand, it is well known that Marilyn Monroe converted to Judaism prior to her marraige to Arthur Miller.  Surprisingly there is no mention of this anywhere in the book.  Considering the fact that many pages are devoted to tangential aspects of her life, this ommission calls into question the accuracy of the entire work.

B0026RHR6K|2.0|So far, I like the show - grim and gritty space opera with little flashes of humor. This is my kind of thing, at least so far. But the disks are not well packed and we've already had to clean some to get them to play properly, and the box they came in, while very \\"cute\\", is annoying to handle and store. At this point I am going to have to check and clean all the disks, put them in proper cases, and index them episode by episode - there's just no excuse at this price point.    As for the \\"collectible cylon\\" - collectibles should have intrinsic value, in my opinion. This is a grey plastic doll with a few movable joints. It's not a selling point.    The show is fun and deserved better packaging - better meaning simpler. Buyer beware.    Addendum: one thing someone unfamiliar with the series may want to know: this is not hard sci fi or even close. Given a choice between a dramatic moment, and sticking to anything that holds up to the most basic science we teach in high school, the writers went for the dramatic moment almost every time. This is only a bad thing if you like your sci fi firmly grounded in factual reality; BSG is much more about myth and legend and psychological angles. I enjoy that aspect, but there *are* a handful of moments where anyone whose got a layman's background in biology, comp sci or physics is going to have to suspend their disbelief with a shiploader's crane. Much more fi than sci. It's more noticeable in this series than in Babylon 5 or Firefly. On the plus side there's not much Star Trekkian pseudoscience; no overt dwelling on the magic di-lithium crystals that make the ship (or any plots) go. Just be aware that if you're analytical by nature, there's going to be a few oh-please moments. Still very worthwhile, though.    Addendum: the oh-please moments shoot through the roof in the last season; the writers apparently lost their way and had no idea where to take the story. It's noticeable enough to be annoying. Enjoy the ride and the scenery,is my advice, because the destination is not special.
B003DO13OC|2.0|I can't imagine why I bought this. For over 30 years, Ommadawn has been one of my favourite albums by anyone ever. The remix is self-indulgent in the extreme and shows, yet again, why it's not a good idea to monkey with success. The \\"lost version\\"...? Ho hum, really for completists only. Yes, it gives clear insight into the creation of the album but there's a shock waiting almost at every turn. Sorry, gang, but I wonder why this album was put out at all. Maybe I can't get out of the original mix enough to appreciate what Mike's done here but I don't want to. I love the album as was and this is not going to get a second hearing. It makes me wonder if Mike's well has started to dry up...
B003TZ9EGO|3.0|To some, 'The Remix' is a terrific buy and find: collection of 10 remixes spanning Lady GaGa's first two releases: [[ASIN:B001GM28HO The Fame]] and [[ASIN:B002W6Z0UK The Fame Monster]]. Basically, there's a remix from every single she's released thus far with a few extras tossed in. Yet, to me, these 10 remixes are definitely not the best Lady GaGa has to offer, even in terms of remixes. What strikes me as odd about the U.S. edition and release of 'The Remix' is that compared to the international releases, it's severely skimpy and stripped down. For example, the U.K. release of the album has 17 tracks and yet again the release in the U.S. market is far less. What we have is a collection of so-so remixes: there's one or two really good ones but mostly a lot of mediocrity. To top it off, there's really nothing new with this product: fans will come to realize that many of these remixes have been released on the past singles/remix collections that have accompanied each single thus far. They've been around for a while thanks to physical releases, iTunes, other digital stores like Amazon and of course are all over the Internet due to the fact that 'The Remix' album has actually been around for months due to international releases. Is there anything really new on this release? Not really, and that's a bit disappointing overall.<br /><br />The Good: First, I'm glad to see 'The Remix' got a U.S. release (period) considering it's been long overdue. The best part of the release is that it's a nice, frivolous reminder of the hits that have helped Lady GaGa become a household name and staple of the music industry. The tracks seem to be in chronological order of the single's release, and all of the big hits are represented in some way. A few of the mixes, including \\"Alejandro (Sound of Arrows Mix)\\" and \\"Poker Face (LLG Vs GlG Radio Mix Remix)\\" feel like true \\"remixes\\" - they take the vocals and uproot the familiar beat and music to give the track and vibe of the song and entirely new outlook and feel.<br /><br />The Bad: The album is pulled down by the fact that the remixes chosen for this release really aren't the best. A lot of them, if listened to in one setting, sound really similar and boring: they disregard the vocals and lyrics in favor of inserting a new instrumental track meant to make the song sound club and dance worthy. To me, that doesn't make a great remix. The LoveGame remix featuring Marilyn Manson sounds gimmicky and lame with his vocals breaking up the song and the ill attempt to turn the pop song into a mosh-pit rock hit; the Starsmith mix of \\"Bad Romance\\" just takes out all the elements that made the original fun and unique in favor of new instrumentation that doesn't really go with the vibe and lyrics of the track; the Monarchy `Stylites' Remix of \\"Dance in the Dark\\" overall lacks any emotion and makes the track feel boring. My issue with 'The Remix' is that in its international releases, other remixes that added more variety and flavor to the overall album were included and made it feel worth of listening to and buying. The U.S. release, however, features some of the most common, dull remixes from GaGa. There were tons of better remixes of some of these tracks available and it seems hard to believe that these were truly the best.<br /><br />My suggestion: get your hands on the Japanese or U.K. version of [[ASIN:B003LCIJZ2 The Remix (IMPORT)]] - they both offer more tracks, more variety and better remixes. This U.S. version is very average and doesn't do all of the remixes done for GaGa any justice - it's definitely not a representation of the best of the remixes from her career thus far, which should have been the focus and intention of the album. If you're a big fan of Lady GaGa, you probably already have most of these remixes in your possession and other than buying this for your collecting purposes, it's not really worth purchasing. If you're a casual GaGa fan and are into dance music, then get this - it's a nice alternative/remixed intro to Lady GaGa.<br /><br />Listen To These: \\"Alejandro (Sound Of Arrows Remix)\\", \\"Poker Face (LLG Vs GlG Radio Mix Remix)\\", \\"Paparazzi (Stuart Price Remix)\\"o to Lady GaGa.

142313494X|4.0|I like the approach the author takes with his story.  It doesn't compare with the Harry Potter books but is definitely a worthwhile read.

0545128285|3.0|The Tales of Beedle the Bard serves as a supplement to the Harry Potter series. This book is first mentioned in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. What Grimm's Fairy Tales is to muggles, The Tales of Beedle the Bard is to wizards and witches. This book was written for charity, and the proceeds from purchase go to a children's charity.<br /><br />The Tales of Beedle the Bard is broken into five short tales, each with a bit of commentary afterward written by Albus Dumbledore. All five stories are short and have dark elements in the vein of old fairy tales. My favorite story is probably \\"The Warlock's Hairy Heart.\\" It tells of a warlock that locks away his most prized possession so he does not have to love and care about anything but himself.<br /><br />This book was read aloud to my wife (or vice versa), and it fell nicely into the bedtime story catalog. While I can't recommend it for heavy or serious reading, it was refreshing to have a short tale that could induce laughter or intrigue, even if it was fleeting. It seems that brevity is, in fact, the biggest fault of The Tales of Beedle the Bard. Perhaps if there were more than five tales...<br /><br />All of the tales offer some sort of moral, but I don't think any of them are impacting and lasting. I can't imagine anyone reading these without any Harry Potter knowledge, but if they did it would be mostly understood, though I can't say it would be greatly enjoyable.<br /><br />Overall, The Tales of Beedle the Bard offered a few enjoyable nights of bedtime stories and it allowed me to read something new in the Harry Potter universe. I would have liked more depth, more character, more things I'd expect from a novel, but this was not the intent of Rowling. Is the book worth the cheap cover price? Maybe, especially to fill out the HP personal library. Is it worth a trip to the local library to check out? Absolutely.
B002RBU4GA|5.0|I drive more than an hour to work (each way) and I listen to audio books to break up the time.  This is probably my favorite audio book that I've ever listened to.  First let me say I'm a serious animal lover so if you aren't, it may not be for you.  The dog (Enzo) is the narrator and it's told from his perspective.  He talks the way we like to think our dogs think.  He is very smart and funny as well as introspective with a human's outlook on life.  It was LOL funny and also sad in places.  I might listen to it again after I finish tomorrow-and I've never done that before.  I wonder if the book version is as good, the dog's voice is perfect for audio.  Oh and don't let the racing theme deter you, I'm not a racing fan at all but the author uses racing stories as a sort of metaphor for life.
B001FB55MG|5.0|This movie is the perfect combination of sweet, funny, romantic and ingenius! I truly belive it has something for each member of the family and is combined to make a flawless masterpiece for all to enjoy! This movie uses apropriate but impeccable humor and the characters all show an upbeat and postive perspective on life. The use of two British characters in this film help give an appreciate and wholesome view on other cultures! The cartoons are a clever touch that will delight you with thier charm. This film is in general a good example that if you work hard and treat your siblings politely, you can accomplish anything! I highly recomend you sharing this with your family so they too can find joy in it!
B00290FWYS|5.0|The return of Cafe del Mar!!  This volume was supposed to be released in 2009 but never materialized.  In fact the whole Cafe del Mar catalog began to disappear.   So it's a great relief to chill fans to see the label and compilation series rise again.  Not the exact Balearic sound of the 90's, but still some of the best chill you can lay your ears on.  Strongly recommend. Now, if they'd only release it on vinyl
B002VECM6S|5.0|This is one of the best most heartwarming, wonderful, uplifting and beautiful stories I have ever seen! It brings out the best in every character and teaches us to embrace the poor and lonely! It is truly a tale that every family should see together and one that can change the lives of anyone who viewes it! Big Mike and his new little brother SJ changed the way i look at family, friendship and athletics! The bravery and good manners shown throughout the tale made me wish that we all lived that way and wondered what other wonderful things occured in the story, especially since im sure this very short movie could not cover all details! I would highly recomend this tale to each and every person on our great earth and think that each and every actor in it should win an oscar and the family that this movie is the true story of should win the Nobel Peace Prize!
0061733199|3.0|The content of this book gets five stars for being neatly organized and helpful, however this edition is in serious need of a revision.     My first indicator was the introduction to the book. It mentions the Berlin Wall coming down in 1999. An oversight like this is inexcusable and sent up warning flags right away as to how many eyes had actually read the book from cover to cover (as I'm in the process of doing).     The text is written in a British style (SAS, of course), which will take some getting used to for US readers but isn't a big deal. That said, I've still had to re-read several passages due to poorly assembled sentences which lack proper punctuation. Has this guy ever heard of a comma? They can be a lifesaver to a reader.  Again, not to be a grammar snob, but if you want to use this as a quick reference in a time of need, the last thing you want to tackle is a confusing run-on sentence. Those are my major gripes.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|This movie was a nice idea but if you really think about it its really gross! I mean rats in the kitchen? Thats not even legal! Yet someone at Disney Pixar thinks its a good idea to fill the minds of impressionable young children with images of keeping unsanitary rodents in a place where sanitation should be the top priority! Harmless and charming, I think not! But the concepts in the story dealing with actual people are charming and the movie does a magnificent job of showing what professional kitchens really and truly are like. So if your interested in that idea, carry on but if you want a movie where people keep cute little pets, this is the wrong movie because the rats are not cute, they are disgusting!
0061537969|5.0|A must read for anyone who has ever known a dog or just respects these loving creatures.  Must read all the way to the end!  Wonderful, surprise ending!
B003X7MCGW|5.0|Well, what's the deal with this album?  First of all, it's not a live album, even though it sounds recorded \\"live\\" in some ways.  Second, it's not a greatest hits, really, but it's close.  The band decided, after 20 years of making music, to take stock and re-record acoustic versions of some of their best songs.  The versions aren't just a boring retread.  Some of the songs are drastically different or extended.  Really, it's like sitting in a living room with the Crowes as they play songs of theirs that they enjoy playing.    The versions aren't sloppy, either.  The playing is fantastic and Chris Robinson's singing sticks more to the melody than he does live.  He never tries to replicate a studio recording exactly, but these versions are more easy to sing along with than some live versions of the songs.    Overall, anyone who is a fan of the Crowes OR southern rock OR acoustic music is going to dig this album.  It's probably not a bad starting place for new fans, either.  It is what it is--a sort of low-priced gift to the fans for 20 years of loyalty. (NOTE: the iTunes version does have 2 bonus songs that aren't on the amazon version, and the price is $2 more.  Thus, the amazon version is a better bargain, but if you're willing to pay .99 cents for each of the bonus songs, the iTunes version is a necessary evil.)
1600241824|4.0|I don't know what it is about Sedaris' writing, but I've decided I want to pitch a tent in his frontal lobe and live the rest of my days as a disciple of his neuroses.  \\"When You Are Engulfed in Flames\\" is another wicked collection of short stories that at times had me laughing to the point of broken capillaries.  When I read the anecdote about his experience buying pot from a redneck living in a double wide with a girlfriend who referred to the remote control by the n-word, I thought my head was going to explode.<br />Now, to be fair, this book is not all comedy.  In fact, of the books of his that I've read I would consider this one to be the most reflective, if not downright serious at times.  The last chapters read far more like a journal than a hysterical composition of outrageous yarns.  But on the whole I loved this volume and I continue to ADORE Sedaris.  In a perfect world, he and his life partner, Hugh would open the antique doors of their country home in Normandy and say, \\"Welcome home, Tori.  David here has sobered up but you're welcome to live with us and deplete his old stashes of drugs, cigarettes and liquor.\\"
B00000JSJC|2.0|if you step back from the analysis and just get a feel for a movie, you can tell the good from the bad. this ain't one of the good.<br />the ideas in this movie are anything but new. william gibson wrote neuromancer in 1983 ~ comfortably before this flick.<br /><br />the movie lacks a consistent feel that keeps you attached. i have very broad interests in sci-fi and found this one just too unbelievable. i have a deep appreciation for directors that feel that explicit violence and sex are *not* necessarily required. the directors of this movie have no such inhibitions: they felt that this movie could not be made without it. however, neither the violence nor the sex had much to do with the core of the plot. see blade runner for the exact opposite approach: not all possible opportunities for violence are shown. not all sex is revealed.<br /><br />and here is my case in point: the most violent scenes in the movie all get the same reaction from all characters in the movie. utter horror and revulsion. and explicit condemnation of the perpetrator. why should i feel any different? the directors and actors involved in the scene deserve our revulsion.<br /><br />and a completely down and out cop who repeatedly shows his inability to defend himself, finally takes out an ex football player in one stroke and holds his own in an all-out fight with a body-guard type. no kidding? and the non-violent mother of one trying to make something of her life *takes*out* two foaming-at-the-mouth bully cops. huh.<br /><br />again: blade runner has it right: the ex cop is kind of mediocre at hand-to-hand fighting thru the entire movie and resorts to a gun to kill when he can. the non-violent 'woman' makes one shot with a gun and nothing else (even tho she probably could do way more).<br /><br />i reject this movie based on it's own depictions and lack of cohesion.
1400095204|5.0|I love this book and this author.  I lost it on the train when I was 20 pages from the end and had to buy another copy.  This is one for the library.  It is historical, engaging and gripping.  The characters are very colorful and endearing, each in its own way.  I also read Purple Hibiscus which I enjoyed just as much though it was very different.  Highly recommend both.
B001TW68P4|3.0|Hopefully Mark and Howard will be reading this.  How many times does the public need a greatest hits   package ? At last count, it's been 6 times on c.d. since  1995. How about doing what cbs/legacy did with  The Byrds Releases or iconclassic did with The Guess who.  Remaster each album starting with the 1965 album \\"It  ain't me babe\\". Put bonus tracks from the album sessions  with liner notes and commentary from the band members that  played on the sessions along with producers notes.  It's been haphazard with those releases and i'm hoping  one day they'll do it right.
9889979942|5.0|Tom Carter's \\"Portrait of a People\\" is a beautiful, poignant look at a country going through rapid economic and cultural changes. As China continues to modernize and become more open to the outside world, all of China's provinces and people will be drastically affected--with cultural traditions possibly pushed to the wayside. That Carter was able to capture so many of China's minority cultures at this moment in time is thus very significant. Beyond capturing a people at the cusp of change, Carter's photos are incredibly soulful and engage the reader with his subjects at a deeper level. This book is highly recommended for anyone interested in China, diversity of cultures, photography and beauty.
B003O85W3A|5.0|If you've loved each of Arcade Fire's albums, you'll still love this one. Starting with the EP, each new turn has evolved from the turn before it, and the same is true with this album. It's not Funeral, and it's  not Neon Bible, and the band is true to itself rather than simply mimicking its earlier successes. And, at the same time, this album is clearly an extension of each of the three previous products, as it takes that storyline of America nearing an apocalypse to its conclusion (for now, at least). Like the EP and Funeral, it's almost a really, really chilled-out \\"Ziggy Stardust,\\" but like Neon Bible, it experiments with new arrangements and sounds without radically changing the band's style.    The album does sound more produced than the previous albums, but why shouldn't it be? They're super rich now. The songs are just as powerful as on the previous records, though they seem at times more mellow and the melodies seem more subtle. As always, the arrangements, the harmonies, and maybe above all else the creepy but familiar lyrics are what make the songs unique and unforgettable. Early in the opening song, Win Butler sings: \\"So you're standin on the opposite shore/But by the time the first bombs fell/We were already bored.\\" Who starts an album that way? Only them.    After the first day with the album, my favorite songs are: \\"Empty Room\\" - whenever you hear Regine start singing, it's kind of like when you saw Catwoman ride onto the Batman opening credits and knew she'd be in the episode; \\"Half Light I\\" and \\"Half Light II\\" - understated rock ballads; \\"Waking Hours\\" - the melody is very pretty on this one; \\"Deep Blue\\" - best arrangement on the album; \\"Sprawl II\\" - I can't even describe this one, it's so odd and so good. And just wait until you get to the very end. It's a surprise, and a cliffhanger. Who ends an album that way?    If you haven't already, buy The Suburbs. You're going to like it. It's not a disappointment, just a slight and natural change in expression of the same direction.
B002ZG983M|5.0|What makes a super-hero in myth? It can be anything from a landmark moment in a characters past or a discovery of a power that no other mortal posesses. You know the history and all the iconic names that go along with those origins, but what if you were just an ordinary person who felt the need to just help the innocent and just go out there and kick some evil ass? Well that is pretty much what Kick-Ass did.<br /><br />Kick-Ass is the story of an average comic loving nerd that suddenly felt two things needed to be done. Evil needed to be punished and he needed to get laid. So after many attempts he finally became the green and yellow scuba suit wearing hero 'Kick-Ass' What he didn't count on was that being a super-hero wasn't going to be such a cake walk. On his journey he encounters others who are out there vanquishing evil and it is not such an easy job.<br /><br />'Kick-Ass' as much as I was anticipating to see this movie ended up surpasing my expectations. I had never seen a movie that was as hystercially funny turn into such a slap-happy over the top gore-fest with some extremly serious moments as well. it was as if Quinten Tarantino directed Superbad. The acting was amazing and every actor gave 110%. I also loved the fact that there was a female character that girls could admire...not neceserally look up to because well Chloe Mortez is only 13 years old. Still, this movie is incredible it has huge laughs mind blowing fight scenes and it just oozes with awesomeness. And hey, how many times and the success of a movie based on a graphic novel cause the authors of the first to write a sequel and base a sequel film on it?
1601251505|5.0|I bought this after looking through a friend's Pathfinder RPG core rulebook.  I never played D&D much before this, and the one 3.5 campaign I took seriously was fun although a lot of the rules were nit-picky for a beginner.  We have recently picked up Pathfinder and it has gotten me hooked on tabletop RPGs.<br /><br />The rules are extremely similar to 3.5, so if you already own 3.5 books I'd suggest looking online at paizo's reference document (just google \\"pathfinder rpg prd\\" and click on paizo's link).  Part of the open game license requires them to have it available for free online so consider just brushing over the rule changes there.  One can argue that Pathfinder is basically D&D 3.75, and theres nothing really wrong with that.  Some people do not like 4th edition (I have never tried it) and prefer 3.5, Pathfinder basically simplifies a few aspects of 3.5 and makes it more accessible to play.  If you do not own 3.5 or have not played many tabletop RPGs, then Pathfinder is a great choice!<br /><br />A lot of the rules, especially in combat, have been streamlined; for example \\"combat maneuvers\\" such as grappling, disarming and bull rushing are easier to figure out and things like flanking are simplified.  The races have been rebalanced a bit and feats come more often now, which is GREAT for players because now their characters are capable of doing more things earlier on, making things much more fun for everyone.<br />Players can chose their character's favored class regardless of race and races with human blood (humans, half-elves and half-orcs) can assign their ability score bonuses manually, due to humanity's adaptable nature.  Feats now come every other level instead of every third level, so for example a fighter would gain a feat every level.  Feats have been reworked slightly to compensate for this.<br /><br />The skills have been improved a great deal in my opinion.  A number of skills have been rolled together, helping keep players from spreading skill ranks too thin.  Diplomacy now stands in for Persuade and Gather Information; Listen, Spot and Search are now Perception;  Tumble and Jump are now Acrobatics.  Assigning skill ranks is much simpler with class and cross-class skills.  If it is a class skill and you have at least one rank in it, you get a bonus +3 to the skill modifier.  Cross-class skills do not get the +3, and for ANY skill the max rank you can have is your total hit dice.<br />They removed skill synergies which was could be tricky to pull off for some players, and to compensate there are skill improvement feats that improve with higher skill ranks.  One great modification they made, is raising your ability scores is applied retroactively for ALL ability scores.  In 3.5 it did not apply to Intelligence but now if your intelligence raises and alters your modifier, you get additional retroactive skill points.<br /><br />There are a number of additional modifications made to the 3.5 rules.  Some reviews have stated quite truthfully that Pathfinder is essentially D&D 3.5 and a few house rules can be added to basically create what you see in the pathfinder core rulebook.<br />As stated before, if you already own 3.5, consider saving your money and looking up the changes online then add them yourself as house rules.  If you do not own 3.5, then Pathfinder is a great choice.  The book is an impressive 575 pages and the presentation is FANTASTIC.  It has a unified artistic design with some GREAT pictures and the content is laid out logically.  There are a few sections I would rearrange, but where they are located does make sense.<br /><br />*Check which printing your core rulebook is when you get it, it will say at the bottom of the credits page at the very front.  Paizo has released some fixes on their website, to bring the first and second printings up to date with the 3rd.  They are small errata download pdfs fixing grammatical errors and minor inconsistencies.  I haven't encountered them myself, they aremostly in the miscellaneous rules and for classes my friends and I rarely play.  The majority of the book is well put together and Paizo is making sure the errors are corrected :)<br /><br />All in all, I found the book to be very well worth the purchase especially at the price amazon was selling it for (around $32 when I bought it)ses my friends and I rarely play.  The majority of the book is well put together and Paizo is making sure the errors are corrected :)    All in all, I found the book to be very well worth the purchase especially at the price amazon was selling it for (around $32 when I bought it)
044654146X|5.0|When I was a boy in Florida, I was 'buddied' with a Jewish kid named Schwartz, this was because I was a new 'out of stater' without prejudices towards Jews, and as students we had but one thing in common, and I am not Jewish!  At the time Israel and the Jewish commuinty world-wide was still feeling sorry for itself and 'protected' everything about the Jewish world and Israel in particular, and Israel was then an international basketcase of a near Marxist Socialist European outpost with the nearest true friend 7000 miles away.  This lasted until about the 1990's when a new attitude towards creativity and the support of sheer brainpower in a place with no other natural resources than its people.  This new regime established by Bibi Netanyahu, transformed 5 million Jews into an international technical community without whose skills and crativity a whole range of common electronic and other hi-tech items, PCs, laptops, servers, and the software to make them run efficiently, medical equipment, and so on, would not be with us today.  As a consequence, all PC's, laptops and servers ought to include \\"Israel Inside\\" as well as the more common logo.  While the USA is trying to control business enterprise, Israel has accepted that this only stifles investment, jobs and the building of industrial power, and all based on an efficient Israeli version of the American chutzpah of the past, the willingness to try and probably fail, and then be forgiven for failing.  This book is a fascinating read and should be accompanied by an equally fascinating read, \\"The Israel Test,\\" as both show why the neighboring places surrounding Israel, with perpahps more than fifty times the population of Israel will still be wallowing in self pity,jealousy,and anger, simply because the Israelis can do things better than even the current USA!  Perhaps more American politicans should read this book to see why a country with the population of Manhatten can outperform all individual Eurpopean countries, and Japan and China as well, in advancing technology to greater levels.
0375826742|3.0|Spoilers!   It seems to me that Paolini is getting to be a better writer as this series progresses. He does seem to be trying not to be long winded, but still needs a lot of work. I nearly laughed out loud when he described King Orren as \\"a long winded fellow.\\" After that, I started to wonder if Paolini modeled King Orren after himself! This book is worth the read for a few vital conversations and scenes:  1. Arya talks about why she's different from the rest of her kind, and that the person she loved was killed.  2. Orik is crowned king  3. Finding out that Brom was his father (Paolini really needs to choose one character to be his father, first book: we don't know, second book: Morzan, and now it's Brom. I fervently hope that it stays that way.)  4. Discovering how Galbatorix's powers have been increasing over all these years.   5. The final fight scene in which Arya kills a Shade and Ormis and Gladier die.   I tend to read books over and over again, and almost always the whole way through, but I couldn't do that with this book. In fact, I found myself simply skipping to the 5 scenes above and not bothering to read any of the other needless fluff. Also, I found the battles from Roran's point of view rather disturbing, especially the part where he laughs. And Eragon needs to stop having all these needless conversations about death. He talked about it with Roran, Arya, Ormis, and many others besides, how many opinions does he need? Everyone gives him the same answer!   Despite all its faults, it is still a pretty good book and I would still recommend it for teenagers.
0375805613|5.0|I remember reading this book to baby sitting children and couldn't wait to get it for my child.  It took her a couple days to enjoy it but now she brings it to me a couple times a day to read it. She loves it!
0743277465|3.0|Apparently I read a different book than most of the reviewers here.  As an avid chess player and one who's interested in self-actualization, I was naturally drawn to Waitzkin's work.  As so many others have pointed out, this book is more auto-biographical than a guide to learning.  In that I've seen the movie and read the book 'Searching for Bobby Fischer', I know all that I need to from a biographical perspective.  Really had very little interest in Tai Chi Push Hands and Josh's competitive experiences in this discipline.  In fact, I have no idea what Push Hands even is, except that it's some type of martial art.    If you're looking for books on learning and growth, there are scores of other titles readily available and vastly superior to this one.  Check out:  'Flow', 'Peak Learning', any of several books by Edward De Bono, any of several books by psychologist Aaron Beck, Focusing, etc. etc..  If you haven't read Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, written by Robert Pirsig, one of the endorsers of Waitzkin's book, do so, it's a masterpiece.    If you want to read a decent autobiography, 'Searching for Bobby Fischer' is better than the subject title.    Hope that helps.

1579125549|4.0|This book is massive, and it is only chess problems.  Hundreds, thousands, of examples of mate in one, two or three moves take up most of the book.  If you like to figure out chess puzzles, this is the book for you.  I bought it for my chess-obsessed son and he disappeared into it for days. It also has many great games by leading masters through the decades, including many from the famous Polgar family.  This is not an intro training guide for chess - it is exactly what the title says - 5334 chess challenges, good for those who love the game.
B000RZIGVS|4.0|I bought this about five months ago and have already found it elsewhere for $100 less than what I paid for it here.  I do have to point out though that I do not know the trust level of the other site I found this product but they were advertising on Facebook. As far as the product itself I am very pleased.  At first I thought the quality looked less than DVD standards and more like VHS copies but recently I watched a few episodes on television and realized that this is just how the show looks and the DVD format cannot improve on that.  I am slightly disappointed in the packaging as it is awkward.  You have to remove a green plastic cover from the top, then remove the DVD cases from a even larger bulky gray casing.  Then the DVD cases are not attached by a spine, instead they are tapped together in three separate units.  Then each of the individual DVDs were wrapped in a small plastic bags.  Compared to other complete TV series like The Twilight Zone which had much better packaging, I have to wonder what they were thinking when they designed this thing.  However being a Star Trek fan it's worth it to have every episode of TNG.
B000001GXJ|5.0|It may take a while for you to get into this opera. It is very dark in nature, but it is so well crafted that soon you will like it. The cast is outstanding. Everything about this recording is first class. Not only is this the best Simon Boccanegra, but one of the best opera recordings, period.
B00005JOFQ|3.0|American Icons have been under attack the last half-century or so, a process that was started by the Left, accelerated in the '60s by the counter-culture, and carried on in the 70s-today by Hollywood and television.  You name it, if it's an American Icon, it's been trashed ..... the church, the Pilgrims, Columbus, George Washington, sports heroes, American business, the American military, the police, the President, \\"Dead White Males,\\" etc etc.  All to cut out our beliefs, make us weak, make us ashamed of our heritage, and open us up to radical change.  BUT there was always the Cowboy.  The Cowboy, the strong, self-reliant, self-confident yet humble, physically and mentally tough Cowboy.  He faced down the elements, wild animals, Indian attacks, and outlaws; he rode horses all day, roped cattle, slept out in front of a fire, and shot guns when he had to.  Now THAT was an image that Americans could look upon and get some inspiration from.      So of course, Hollywood had to go after the Cowboy and trash him in our minds.  Replace that image with something twisted.  OK, let's see, let's make him gay!  And two of them getting it on out in the wilderness!  Now, make this into a seemingly intelligent, compelling & artful movie, so the critics have less reason to put it down, and there it is ............ you've just shot down one of America's icons.  Anytime anyone brings up the Cowboy as an example of America's proud past and toughness, and some snide jerk will snicker, \\"Oh yeah, just like Brokeback Mountain,\\" and undercut the argument with sarcasm and derision.  SO that's what this movie is all about.  It's called Cultural Marxism.  Destroy America's cultural icons, and you can manipulate Americans.  (See my review of American Beauty for another example.)      The filmmakers dropped two gay Greenwich Villiage guys into Wyoming and Texas, made them cowboys, and ran their little \\"love\\" story.  They COULD HAVE changed the characters and setting and kept a similar story, butno, they had to go for the jugular, and trash the image of the Cowboy.  Next thing you know, they'll make a movie about Patton and make him gay.  Or two gay Marines on Iwo Jima.  Whatever.    As for the plot, the acting, the scenery, the story, the music, the directing, that's all secondary to this agenda.  But I give the movie 3 stars because much as you might HATE the agenda, the story is entertaining.
B000002J6F|5.0|Though I've always been a huge fan of CSN and CSN&Y, somehow this record flew under my radar for many years. I was aware of Manassas but never took the time to listen - until now.  What a superb effort on Stephen Stills part.  I have to consider this to be as good an effort as anything he's ever recorded.  An amazing accomplishment when you stop to think about it as he wrote or co-wrote some twenty songs in remarkably varying musical styles in the short period between his 1971 second solo outing and this record.  What makes this album a milestone, in my opinion, is the unique marriage of country and latin musical styles.  You wouldn't think congas and timbales would work with pedal steel guitar, but what an innovation.  What make this more than just an elongated Stills album is the huge presence of Chris Hillman.  He was the perfect foil for Stills to play off of.  The vocal blend between him and Stills was excellent, so much that I didn't miss hearing Crosby and Nash singing with him.  It's interesting though that \\"So Begins the Task\\" sounds very much like CSN and that \\"Bound to Fall\\" could have been taken from a Buffalo Springfield album.  In any event, I highly recommend this album to anyone who wants to hear what great music used to sound like.

B003X73QA8|5.0|In brief, and I mean very brief...this album is worth every penny.  Incredibly creative on many levels, catchy, engaging, and unforgettable.       I won't go into detail about each and every song on the album (of which there is a plentiful 16 tracks), but as a music lover in general, I'd recommend it to anyone looking for something fresh and unique.    As an owner of thier two previous albums and having enjoyed them thoroughly, this album was a no-brainer for me, but I can see people of all ages with broad musical interests enjoying this album for years to come.     Don't think about it, just buy it. Arcade fire is one of the most talented bands on the planet.      You won't be disappointed.

0393072231|4.0|The author's LIAR'S POKER was the best book on the macho culture of investment banking in the Eighties. This is the single best explanation of how the hell the financial crisis of the late Oughts happened. Lewis tells the stories of a few contrarians who couldn't shake the feeling that subprime mortgage bonds, collateralized debt obligations, all that stuff, was nothing but a vast shell game created by the big investment banks and abetted by clueless rating agencies. The kindest way to put it is that none of the big-shots understood these new instruments, and in many cases that's literally true. But elbow grease and courage -- the ability to stand firm even when *everybody* is telling you there's no way housing prices can fall all at once, everywhere -- created well-earned fortunes for a few naysayers. In two or three rare spots, the technicalities become too arcane for Lewis to achieve the clarity of LIAR'S POKER, but most of this sad tale is understandable (in hindsight) by anyone. For example: if a lender offers a \\"teaser rate\\" of 6% that jumps to 12% after two years, the only way a borrower can handle the new reality is to refinance at a higher price (creating yet another deal for the lender). But that only works if home prices are *rising*. If they're not, then once the two-year fantasy period ends, kablooie. Default, and *no* dough for the lender. Our heroes figured this out -- and now they had to convince their own backers to suffer losses during the agonizing period of artificially low interest, before kablooie happened and they became rich and, sadly, rewarded for being cynical.
B001N1DPDE|3.0|So I have really mixed feelings about this knife. On the one hand, the quality and ergonomics are fantastic. It's everything the other reviewers say it is. I spent a whole weekend in the mountains putting this knife through the paces, and it's stellar. But I still struggle with it because of its size. I feel like it's too much knife for some tasks, and not enough for other tasks.<br /><br />Here's the problem. This knife tries to be the kitchen sink - the one knife for every task. But in reality, knife tasks break down into two broad categories: fine work like cutting cord, food, feather sticks, etc., and heavy work like chopping and batoning wood. In my opinion, a knife that's heavy and sturdy enough for the latter is too clumsy for the former. \\"Jack of all trades, master of none ... \\"<br /><br />The Becker Campanion is a hefty knife. I wore it around on my belt the whole weekend, and there was never a time I wasn't aware of it there. It's a full pound of knife tugging on your pants. You'll need a thick utility or gun belt to make this ride more comfortably.<br /><br />Because of its heft, it's actually a passable chopper and it was fantastic at splitting wood with a baton. With that 1/4\\" blade, it's a short knife that's deliberately designed for heavy duty work. The problem is that because of the short blade, you're limited to about 4\\" wood. I found that too limiting. Most of the dead wood around my camp site was 6\\" or thicker.<br /><br />Then we get down to the fine work - the kind of stuff you're pulling your knife out all the time to handle. Because of the heft, it was awkward using this knife to open a boy's bag of beef jerky or trim off a length of cord. Too much knife for the job, which can be dangerous. I found myself resenting having to pull out this much knife every time I needed to do a small job and started wishing for a smaller knife.<br /><br />Which begs the question: if I'm going to end up taking two knives, why would I take this one as the \\"big\\" knife? It's not quite long enough for big knife tasks.<br /><br />Which brings us back to my quandary. How do I rate this knife? The ergonomics and quality are outstanding. But it tries to do too much and ends up not doing any of it as well as more specialized knives would. So here's what it comes down to. If I can only take one blade with me, the Ka-Bar Becker BK2 Campanion isn't a bad choice. As a jack-of-all-trades, it does as good a job as anyone could expect. But if I can take two knives, this one's going to stay home.<br /><br />One word about the sheath. I've got the second generation knife with the tight-locking sheath. It's a great sheath. The complaint I have is that pressing on the thumb break can actually keep the two halves of the sheath from separating. So I end up having to press on the back side of the sheath instead of the thumb break, which isn't as easy. It's not a quick operation to unsheath this knife.

B002VPE1XY|5.0|I really like this case. It provides extra room for memory cards and batteries, and the actual grain is very fine, so it feels luxurious. The case is perfect for smaller snap and shoot cameras and not meant for anything with complex zoom lenses. There are no snap enclosures and any tightness when pulling the camera out.

I did not even know if such a thing was made as a PCI Xpress 1X, but Amazon had it, delivered it quickly; it installed in a snap , and my PC is back to full health. Case Closed :)
0307454541|4.0|Because this is a Swedish story by a Swedish author, all locations in it are in the Swedish language, as are all characters therein.  So it was hard to get into the story with all the unfamiliar and hard to pronounce (say nothing of remembering)names and places.  However, the enticing twists and turns that pulled the tale together finally became irresistible. I'm on the last few pages now and feeling sorry it must end so soon!
B003TZ9EGO|3.0|I love Lady Gaga,but I couldn't agree more with some of the reviewers on here,that yes,both of her CD's are excellent,but I have also heard much,much better remixes than what I have just heard today.I can remember when I use to go out to the clubs and just dance all night long,because of the awesome dance mixes I would hear and they were so well mixed and you could easily dance to them,one after another. But it seems like now days,no one knows how to put that thumping,energy grabbing,great house mix into there music anymore?<br />I have hundreds of Cd's from the 80's,that I still listen to,too this day because to me it was an era where the DJ's listened to what the people wanted and knew how to mix some awesome dance music!! The last time I was in a club,I think maybe I danced one time!I LOVE REMIXES,but the music has to talk to you,it has to call you by name and when you hear it,you know just know it is going to be a remix,that you just have to dance to! you get your tail out on the dance floor and tear it up! This is about as simpliest as I can put it! Where did all the great DJ's go that know how to mix a song into a great house remix,that everytime you hear it,it puts in a mood to where,it's party time on the dance floor!

144185097X|4.0|I didn't realize that the whole story was supposed to be a tape made by Carter and his sister, but it made the audiobook that I listened to even more \\"spot on\\" as you listen to siblings Carter and Sophie argue their way through telling the story about how their father disappeared and how they try to use their ancient power to help them.<br /><br />I haven't read the Percy Jackson series, so I can't compare, but I found this story to be creative and interesting.  I absolutely loved the brother/sister angle, as well as the bi-racial element (their dad is black and Carter favors him and their mom is white, and Sophie favors her, so people don't even believe that they are related).<br /><br />There are two narrators who do a great job telling the story in alternating chapters from Carter and Sophie's points of view.<br /><br />This is a LONG book that might intimidate some readers, but on audio, you don't notice that.  The story moves along, and I can't wait for the next book (which I think I will also choose to listen to instead of read).
B003ELOQD4|3.0|Ok, first the positives:     The sound on this DVD is amazing. Playing this on my home theater system made me feel like I was back at the concert, which in the case of U2 is always a good thing. The video is also extremely sharp and clear.     Now, the negatives:     Ugh. I really hate to criticize this DVD because U2 is my favorite band in the world that still tours and makes music. However, I was at this show and it just doesn't capture what it was like to be there. I know that is an extremely difficult thing to do for a concert video, but U2 has done that before for their concert recordings. If you want proof, look at the ZooTV recording from Australia. Now, I wasn't there for that show, but I did see the outdoor performances in Los Angeles and in Oakland. Watching the ZooTV concert, even though the setlist had changed a little by the time the show reached Australia, felt like I was reliving the shows I'd seen. I was able to turn that video on and show friends what I had been raving about for months. There was a 'this is what it was like' feel to the camera work for that concert and you were able to get an idea of the magnitude of what the ZooTV experience was like. This is SORELY lacking in the 360 DVD. Again, I realize that because the claw was so huge, the DVD only watching crowd would never fully be able to experience what it was like to be in the presence of the claw. But if the editing had just lingered on the claw from distance for more than 2-3 seconds, if there had been a few audience level shots from different points of view from the stadium that maybe lasted 10 seconds or so, then maybe, just maybe, people would have gotten a feel for what it was like to be there. Bombastically over-the-top though the claw was, and rightly or wrongly, many have said the claw detracted from the intimacy of a U2 show, it was a technological marvel to witness and should have been given its 'time in the sun' for this recording. To be completely honest, the worldwide youtube broadcast of the Rose Bowl show was a much better indicator of what it was like to be there. I guess they figured they couldn't just clean up the audio and release that on DVD, but I would much rather own that than this DVD.     Secondly, no Breathe to open the concert? Seriously? Look, always one of the the greatest moments in a U2 show is the dramatic buildup to the opening song. The salvo fired across the bow of the U2 fan that begins a U2 show is crucial. Any U2 fan worth his salt can tell you the opening song of the various U2 tours, it sets the tone for the whole show. Not including Breathe on the setlist except as, essentially, a 'deleted scene' section on disk 2 of the product is completely ridiculous. Not to mention the fact that the reason this was done was stupendously stupid to begin with, the tension created, the way the band was introduced during Breathe, plus the fact that Breathe is simply a kickass song...I don't know, it just boggles the mind.     Thirdly, I brought this up before a little, but the editing, YIKES! Watching this DVD makes me want to kill Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay, you know those guys. The idiots who brought you Armageddon, Con-Air, the Transformers movies, etc. These cinematic delinquents have nearly ruined movie going with the quick-cut editing style that seems to be the formula for big-budget action movies. This editing style makes you worried that you'll start having an epileptic seizure in the movie because the scene changes so quickly. Well, U2 360 is not as bad as some of those movies, but almost. Sometimes the cuts are so quick between Bono, the Edge, Adam and Larry that you start to think maybe they are only one person and not four. Throw the Ang San Suu Kyi masks into the mix and you seriously might think you are losing your mind.     In the end, would I recommend this 360 DVD to others? It's a hard case to make. If you are a U2 fan that wants to be complete and own the visual record of each tour available, then yes. If you didn't get to see 360 and want to get an idea of what 360 was like, i'd say rent it. As for me, I've had this since 2 days after it came out and have only watched it once and I doubt I'll watch it many more times. I'd watch ZooTV, Slane Castle, Red Rocks, heck even U2 in Chicago over watching this, and as a diehard U2 fan, that's tough to say.
B002ZG99G8|1.0|This movie was awful.  An A-Team knock off with about equal depth of acting, TV show not the 2010 remake, and the brewing action could be dissolved with  a mild antacid.  It seemed that the director was distracted through the movie by something else; perhaps, the only distracting feature of the entire thing, Zoe Saldana.  There is a hot scene where she and Jeffrey Dean Morgan duke it out in a burning hotel room - I suggest skipping to that scene and when it's finished remove the DVD from the player.  You won't be losing out on much.<br /><br />Oh, yeah! And there's a bad guy, who I almost forgot about.  He was so fresh out of the bad-guy-action-movie mold that he himself looked loss; searching around the globe for exotic locales that have not been over used by the more orignal, the more menacing.  He failed to be even an entertaining plot device, nay tool.<br /><br />The original comic was set in WWII, that would have been a better jumping off point.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|Once again David Attenborough has been a God send.  This was not quite as in depth as pervious programs, but good none-the-less.  Why the BBC would even consider having anyone else's narration as an option is shameful.  I hope it is not something they will continue.
B002O5M4SA|5.0|Leon is easily one of my top 5 movies.  Reno and Portman work well and easily together, the chemistry of the cast and draw of the action is undeniable.    The Blu-ray offers multiple versions of the film.  It was nice to see the uncut version, I had never seen it prior to this release.  It also gives an \\"anniversary\\" update on the folks who made the film the powerhouse that it is, very nice to see that as well.    If you are on the fence about getting/trying this movie, I say DO IT!  No discussion.

B00005N5RM|4.0|We loved this movie so much we stretched the tape! Now we have it on DVD and the print is perfect. Enjoyed it so much more than the Steve McQueen version; the cast do a convincing job and there are several hold-your-breath moments. Plus one of my favourite lines of all times from a harrassed mother watching her son suck dessert of a plate,\\" Don't eat with your face!\\"  Fast paced, exciting; little town versus bad scientists and eukky enough for any scifi fan.  And with a neat, if predictable, twist at the end.  Package arrived quickly and in excellent condition. Thanks guys!

B000002KMV|5.0|Prince was very aware that after his [[ASIN:B000002KLP Dirty Mind]] album that concepts of morality and politics were going to end up on his lyrical pallette someday. And it came very soon with this album which lyrically turned out to be a self examination on....pretty much every aspect of his viewpoint at the time. None of these songs is really about a specific issue but rather all of the ideas mixed together. And because musically the lyrics were a lot more upfront and open ended than even before there was a need for his musical approch to change yet again. Basically this is the birth of the musical formula of the Minneapolis Sound that would make Prince such a big hit in the next few years. This album also introduces the LINN drum to Prince's sound and all the songs on this album that features that device really showcases Prince's innovative mastery of the instrument. The title song and \\"Let's Work\\" are the most obviously funky songs on this album and,as for that title song the lyrics focus on the speculation on who exactly Prince was-all finding him reciting the lords prayer after which he chants \\"people call me rude/I wish we all were nude/I wish there was no black and white/I wish there were no rules\\". \\"Sexuality\\" is a stomping,pounding example of twin city funk at it's finest with this potent message about a sexually and socially free utopia where people are warned to teach children to read early before they get in trouble and that we're \\"living in a world run by tourists\\",apparently. Another potent message song is the uniquely chorded,almost.....neo psychedelic new wave (if you can image such a thing) \\"Annie Christian\\" where Prince cleverly embodies the anti christ in the persona of a hooker who was personally responsible for the social ills of that time-including John Lennon's murder and the attempted assasination of Regan. That name comes up again with \\"Ronnie Talk To Russia\\" that,with all it's hard rocking noisemaking has a lyric that sounds like it was written hurridly by a 6 year old. Despite the \\"controversy\\" (yes pun very much intended) surrounding who wrote it \\"Do Me,Baby\\" was one of Prince's first popular slower jams and also set the stage for all the other types of these songs he would make in the future. The pop sounding \\"Private Joy\\" and the retro rockibilly styled \\"Jack U Off\\" round out this album. Now while it's true some of the social/sexual orientation of these lyrics are somewhat less thought out than what he'd later emmerge with many of the concepts are sound and,fact is it's doubtful albums such as [[ASIN:B000002L68 \\"Purple Rain\\"]] would've been possible if it weren't for the musical influences of albums such as this.sounds like it was written hurridly by a 6 year old.

0307592839|3.0|Maybe the book, A Visit from the Goon Squad, is a mix of both.  It is fresh and unexpected for author Jennifer Egan to write a novel in a new way - interconnected short stories.  These stories are told in a nonlinear fashion, with some recurring characters.  Her writing style is above par, and the stories are, for the most part, interesting.    However, part of what makes the book different also tends to steer it toward self-indulgence.  The novel has no plot, no specific time line or period, and no specific setting.  While the idea of this book is excellent, Egan didn't pull it off quite as well as intended.  One fourth of the book is a single chapter, presented in power point perspective, that must have been more gratifying to the author than it was to this reader.  The connection I had with the subjects suffered throughout, as it was hard to remember who was what in each time period.  The last chapter referenced characters whose names I remembered, but it wasn't worth searching back through the previous chapters to refresh my memory about their specific interactions, illustrating the lack of cohesion.    Unbelievably, when I had eight pages left in the book, I put it down for two days.  Two days!  Generously,  I am giving this book three stars on the strength of the author's originality.
B002ZCDR88|5.0|I've been aware of Natalie Merchant since the heyday of 10,000 Maniacs. My wife has been collecting her solo efforts as they appear. Nothing I heard previously prepared me for this. I don't know if this helps or not, but Classical music is the biggest part of my musical diet. \\"Leave Your Sleep\\" is more like what passes for \\"Classical Music\\" these days than most \\"New Music\\"--organized noises emerging from grants-to artists and likely to appear at a \\"wet ink\\" concert once, never to be played again. I'm sure the songs from this collection will be performed again, some honestly sound like they'd be more comfortable in Hertz Hall than the Fillmore. \\"Equestrienne\\" is like Paul McCartney's \\"Yesterday\\" only better, a classic song that sounds as if it were written in another time--the horn parts recall Gabrielli.    \\"Leave Your Sleep\\" is a crazy patch-work of different musical styles, from the hillbilly bluegrass of \\"Calico Pie\\" to the baroque glory of \\"Equestrienne\\". It all sounds like the perfect gift from a mother to a daughter, beautiful musical settings of timeless bits of beauty and whimsey. I've never heard Natalie Merchant sound so committed to her material before. Simply as an act of verbal/vocal dexterity a-la Lambert Hendricks and Ross, \\"Bleezer's Ice Cream\\" takes the cake. The quality of the arrangements and the playing is reminiscent of Joshua Rifkin's work for Judy Collins back in the sixties, but these productions are more refined, more focused. More like really good classical music, when you get down to it.
B0015DROBO|4.0|The book needs editing badly to tighten up the main story, remove mountains of minutiae, and get rid of the anticlimactic ending.  There's enough material here for about 3 books so there are too many plots, some of which seem pointless and drag along buried in details.  The book would be better if everything but the murder and main relationship were removed.  The worst thing is that the book continues after the murder is solved (the murderer is an uncompelling nonentity) until it reaches an incomplete and anticlimactic ending.  I gave it 4 stars because the main story and the main characters are good.
B000002KY8|5.0|Prince had really firmly established his musical style,and to a good degree his look with his previous album [[ASIN:B000002KMV Controversy]]. Honestly this album did'nt particularly varriate from the sound of the one before it. Than how come this wound up being Prince's breakthrough album whereas the previous one didn't? The reason has a lot more to do with approch than it does music. While being the first album credit to Prince & The Revolution this was still primarily a one man band recording and Prince uses the occasional to create a living symphony of unique rhythmic textures on the LINN drum machine even more so than he had before hand. The sound of this album is also somewhat less spare than before so the synthesizer arrangements and guitar sounds he brings to the forefront do in fact sound like the work of an actual band most of the time as opposed to the work of one person. Another reason why this did so much better commercially than Prince's first four albums is because this is where Prince learned how to write hits. The title song was an excellent example: it's a full on electro dance/funk number that firmly established the most imitated variety of the Minneapolis sound. Most people might interpret this as a \\"funk party song\\" consequently,even though it's clearly the story of an apocolyptic dream in which Prince wants to party and dance until the end of the world. That theme is repeated continually throughout this (originally) double album set. This is especially true with his variation on the James Brown style of funk,which he'd deny to a degree until later in his life on songs like \\"D.M.S.R\\" and the more new wave inflected,pulsing synth pop of \\"Let's Pretend We're Married\\". These elongated numbers are both very very strong and also contain some simulated sexual sounds and some extremely explicit language even by today's standards. Same goes for the VERY JB inflected funk groove of \\"Lady Cab Driver\\". It's one of my personal favorites on this album and not only is it one of the few songs here that utilize live drumming but the melody obviously inspired Ready For The World's Prince ripoff [[ASIN:B000002OPR Oh Sheila]] a couple years later. A good deal of these songs introduce a rather avante garde new wave-rock approch to commercial viability such as on hits such as \\"Little Red Corvette\\" and the rockabilly sounds of \\"Delirious\\". Classic soul influenced ballads such as \\"Free\\" and \\"International Lover\\" showcase a somewhat easier going sound along with lyrics that range from tales of torrid world wise love affairs as well as musings on how to deal with a breakup-Prince style that is. You get much the same effect on the uptempo \\"Automatic\\" and the percussive \\"Something In The Water (Does Not Compute)\\". One song in the same sort of new wave-funk hybrid actually says a lot more about Prince's social manifesto than anything on the previous album. \\"All The Criticss Love U In New York\\" is a striking statement of pree phoniness that were early echos of Prince's disatisfaction with the recording industry and press even at this stage. Whatever people thought or still think about Prince's lyrical messages and approch his musical innovation and exciting way with a funk groove is something that simply cannot be denied and this represented a long standing peak for Prince musically.rites on this album and not only is it one of the few songs here that utilize live drumming but the melody obviously inspired Ready For The World's Prince ripoff [[ASIN:B000002OPR Oh Sheila]] a couple years later.

B003O7I6L6|3.0|I'd never been a huge, huge fan of EFNY, and I'd always wondered why. It seems that people like myself who like John Carpenter's classic films (e.g., Assault on Precinct 13, Halloween, The Thing, Big Trouble in Little China, etc.) tend to enjoy it a lot. I thought the story was great, the cast was superb, and Snake Plissken is just a fantastic character. For some reason, though, I could never bring myself to think of it as being more than okay. It'd been at least a decade since I'd last seen it, so when I discovered that it was being released on Blu-Ray, I figured I'd give it another shot. After doing so I finally realized why I've never loved Escape From New York: for an action movie, it feels oddly inert throughout much of it.<br /><br />I think that the main culprit here is the editing of Todd Ramsay. During the action scenes, he tends to hold many shots just a few beats longer than they should be held, which kind of destroys their momentum. (Interestingly enough, Ramsay's previous film as lead editor was Star Trek: The Motion Picture, which has been referred to by many as \\"The Motionless Picture.\\") Ramsay also edited Carpenter's next film, The Thing, which is absolutely superb, but The Thing is an entirely different beast (no pun intended...or maybe it was) from EFNY. The Thing is a horror film that is meant to be deliberately paced. There is very little action, rather the focus is on sustained suspense punctuated with short jolts of fright. Holding shots for a few beats too long is actually a good thing there because it plays with the audience's expectations, subtly putting them on edge throughout the duration.<br /><br />However, Carpenter isn't entirely blameless here. After all, the director is usually a major part of the editing process, but even apart from that, his directing style isn't always the best suited to action films. He often lets things play out in static shots when some camera movement would have really given the shots more energy. His framing and blocking also occasionally look a bit perfunctory and uninspired. When enough of the other elements come together, these problems can be overcome (e.g., Big Trouble In Little China), but combined with the major flaw of the editing, it really drags the movie down.<br /><br />I'm not saying that some Michael Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer-esque camerawork or editing would have been preferable. I personally like to see what's actually happening on screen, not shaky close-ups of people's faces or hands or whatnot. I just think that some tightening of the pace in the editing room could have done wonders. For example, take a look at Raiders of the Lost Ark or The Road Warrior, both of which came out the same year. I consider both of them to be pretty much textbook examples on how to shoot and edit action sequences. Some could argue that the comparison with Raiders might be slightly unfair given the fact that its budget was three times that of EFNY. That said, though, EFNY's budget was, in turn, triple that of The Road Warrior, and I believe that my abovementioned complaints could have been resolved by something that, in theory, wouldn't have cost more money.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray looks mighty fine, though. My display isn't top notch--it's only a 37\\" 1080i--but I didn't see many problems with the print. By the same token, there didn't appear to be a lot of DNR or edge enhancement. I'd hazard a guess that this is the best EFNY has looked on home video. No extras at all, unfortunately, so if you have the two-disc special edition, you should hang on to it.o occasionally look a bit perfunctory and uninspired.

B00094ARZ0|5.0|In this tale Bo Derek, finally free from her schoolgirl days seeks adventure and romance. She has always been a muse to me that has reminded me to stay in shape and look young and beautiful throughout my life. Any woman wishes she could look as good as Bo Derek does. She is over 50 now and still looks as young and vibrant as a young adult. However, as much as I am a fan for her I think she could have done the world a greater service by making videos and books for women geared toward making themselves look better and younger and keeping their youth and vigor as they age.
B001KVZ6F2|1.0|Betty, I know you are going to hate me for this, but I have to be honest here.  This movie was just horrible.  It's hard for me to put into eloquent words all of the missteps this poor little film made, because part of me just feels like rambling off a list of bad decisions.<br /><br />First, I'll lay out the plot.<br /><br />Walt is a bitter and grumpy old man who is an unapologetic racist dwelling in a community overrun by those with which he has hatred for.  His family has all but written him off, and this visibly irks Walt.  When his neighbor, young Thao, attempts to steal his Gran Torino (as part of a gang initiation), Walt finds himself in a situation (with individuals) he never foresaw.  After inadvertently saving Thao from the clutches of his cousin's gang, Walt is further introduced to Thao's family, and despite being hesitant he begins to warm to Thao after he officially apologizes.  Walt then has Thao become his `handyman', putting him to work around the house doing odd jobs here and there.  Things seem to go well for the two, and a bond is formed, but if we know anything about gangs we know that this will not be the end of things.<br /><br />The story felt VERY clich&eacute;d and it didn't really try to compensate for those obvious generalizations.  Some make remarks like \\"this is far better than `Crash'\\" but in the end they are both rather embarrassing reflections of racism to be quite honest.  I'd like you to explain to me HOW this is better than `Crash'.  I won't say it is worse (although I gave `Crash' a C, my feelings for that film have dropped considerably), but it is hardly better.<br /><br />So let's take this apart, shall we.<br /><br />I'll start with the script.  Like I said, there are clich&eacute;s that pretty much mount one on top of the other here, from the formulaic way in which Thao's family is represented to the ridiculously generic way that Walt is presented to us.  There is nothing genuine about his character.  Everything feels pulled from another performance or character developed in an Eastwood movie.  This is Eastwood playing Eastwood.  He is grumpy, and everyone knows it, and his family has distanced themselves from him (who can blame them) and yet we are supposed to feel an urge of sympathy for him because he overcomes his racism and befriends Thao and his family?  I found the scene in the barbershop with Thao to be rather ridiculous too.  Yes, this is the type of guy that Walt is, but it's nothing to feel all chummy about.  The way the film ended I thought was (somewhat) clever, and then it went all Hallmark sentiment with the final frame, which I found a tad squeamish.<br /><br />How about the direction, since that is what Eastwood is all about?  Honestly, this film lacks tremendously in that regard.  Now, for all of you out there (yes, you MKIA) who think that I am an Eastwood hater and that I'm blowing this out of proportion, realize that I gave `Million Dollar Baby' an A+ and still highly regard that film (and it's direction), not to mention an A for `Unforgiven', and despite not caring for it collectively, I gave pretty high marks to `Changeling' as well.  This film though, is just poorly constructed and realized.  The direction is very stagy.  Look at the scene when the family is worried about Sue and she comes in the door, and Walt drops his drink.  Watch how the camera zooms into a closeup of the drink, telling us that Walt is going to drop it before he does and then, what does Walt do...he lets go.  It's not a `disoriented slip through his fingers' drop, it's an `open my hand and make a statement' drop.  It just feels fake.  Decisions like that one give this film an air of unnaturalness that ruins any connective tissue.<br /><br />But, the acting takes the cake here.  Casting `non-actors' is kind of a vanity thing for a director, but in the end there are moments where it works.  This is not one of them.  Bee Vang has to carry about as much of this film as Eastwood (we'll get to him in a minute) and so he needed to be more authenticated.  I love how one reviewer makes the statement that while Vang comes off wooden, \\"there is no substitute for authenticity.\\"  Sorry, but that wooden quality strips the performance of authenticity.  He's obviously trying too hard.  Eastwood, like I mentioned earlier, is just playing himself.  Yes, the script is at fault for handing him a caricature (I don't care what you say about his character arc, it just boils down to a mess of generalities) but Eastwood doesn't put any real life into it.<br /><br />Snarling and growling and looking all mean and stuff is not really emoting, like at all.<br /><br />In the end, this overcooked film is just a mess.  I'm sorry Betty, I know you love your Clint (and I won't hold that against you if you don't hold this review against me) but this film is just plain bad.  Maybe the whole racism subject should just be left alone, since no one can really seem to get it right (is it just me or was this another one of those `white guy saves the day' kind of message films), but then again it is a potent subject that has potential to really create something poignant.<br /><br />This is not poignant.w one reviewer makes the statement that while Vang comes off wooden, \\"there is no substitute for authenticity.\\"  Sorry, but that wooden quality strips the performance of authenticity.

B000002KLP|5.0|At the very start of the 80's Prince,who'd already made a big splash in the world with his first two (and very polished pop/R&B oriented) albums decided to begin a hugely critical period for his career. While big commercial success Prince's creativity during the 80's was established during this time. Gone were the slicker (and on his debut [[ASIN:B000002KIG For You]] rather abstract) arrangements and productions of his first two albums and in comes a sound quality that,at least on this album is a lot closer to a demo level recording sound. One of the most interesting things about this album production wise is how it manages to sound both raw and slick. It's easy,if you know how. Or your.....well Prince. Either was that was'nt the end for the musical either. Whereas funk rhythms and rock beats were kind of tenative on his earlier albums here everything about them is rather blended together into that unique hybrid of the fully formed Minneapolis sound. This is also Prince's first album to show a prominant new wave influence. True Prince's multi tracked synthesizer technique did set the stage for a lot of the electro/new wave funk genre but here he kind of pulls it all together. The title is'nt a misnomer either since this begins Prince's trademark lyrical obsession with sexual explicitness. On the title song,\\"Uptown\\" and \\"Do It All Night\\" it all comes together;the funky rhythm guitars,the melodic new wave synth-pop sound and lyrics that range from high school age sexual musings to an ode to sexual diversity,including homosexuality to...well the act of intercorse itself. There are two almost guitar rock oriented songs that have a strong punk/rock edge to them such as \\"When You Were Mine\\" and the shocking (even for Prince) showcase on incest in \\"Sister\\". He also throws in a surprizingly old fasioned rock/soul midtempo ballad in \\"Gotta Broken Heart Again\\". Of course for the serious funk there's the intense (both lyrically and musically) \\"Head\\" that more or less establishes Prince's basic funk sound for the remainder of the decade pretty much as well as his ability to be firey and polished all at the same time,going back to the R&B/funk tradition of what I'll call \\"explicit sophistication\\". The album ends on a similar not with the rollicking funk of \\"Partyup\\" that hints possibly,at least with the not so subtle chant of \\"YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGHT YOUR OWN DAMN WAR 'CAUSE WE'RE NOT GONNA FIGHT NO MORE\\" that direct politics might be part of his lyrical framework in the future,but that's another story. This album wasn't a very popular part of Prince's vast catalog until well over a decade after it was released but all the same it was both a beginning and an end for one side of Prince's musical personality and another. And the material was strong enough for everyone to get a big kick from the ride.that more or less establishes Prince's basic funk sound for the remainder of the decade pretty much as well as his ability to be firey and polished all at the same time,going back to the R&B/funk tradition of what I'll call \\"explicit sophistication\\".

1594488843|5.0|This is a great book for teachers.  As an upper elementary teacher (I've taught 4th through 7th grades, primarily 5th and 6th), I've long struggled with the emphasis on extrinsic motivation.  I think that and the enormous pressure to raise test scores, thus narrowing the curriculum, are doing great damage to our children.  They are told what they must learn and how they must learn it every day of their education.  Their curiosity and interests are not respected and they are responding accordingly with apathy.  This book is a clear, readable summary of the research of motivation and clarified many things for me.  It also made me think deeply about my classroom and my practice and what it is I want for my students, which is to be able to think for themselves and love learning.   Thank you, Mr. Pink, for a boost before I start another school year!
B001AIRUP4|5.0|The Nightmare before Christmas is my favorite movie of all time. I previously had the DVD and decided to upgrade to the Blu Ray and am glad I did. The movies colors are more vibrant and most importantly the backgrounds are a deep black rather than the slightly grey hint seen in the Blu Ray. The sound is more vivid and the whole experience is enhanced by switching to Blu Ray.

0061122416|5.0|This little book is an allegory about one's journey through life. At first, the boy Santiago is referred to by name. Later, though, he is referred to only as \\"the boy,\\" thus emphasizing the Everyman motif as Santiago embarks on his quest to fulfill his Personal Legend. Nor is it necessary to understand Coelho's references to real personages such as King Melchizedek of Salem who receives a tenth of Abraham's spoils of war. Ironically, Abraham himself is not interested in keeping the rest of his winnings, for he has an entirely different \\"Personal Legend,\\" wishing only for descendants (granted to him eventually very late in life). Also, the Emerald Green tablet, allegedly written by Hermes Trismegistus, is only alluded to but not explained in this novel. And it does not really need to be. Yet, for those who are aware of this work and its numerous translations, the story is enriched even further. (I am indebted to my friend Mike Segers for bringing some of those translations to my attention.) In Coelho's novel, alchemy increasingly becomes a metaphor for human spiritual purification symbolized by human efforts to transmute base metals such as lead into gold. Finally, this work could easily be treated as a literary presentation in very simple terms of the rather complex philosophy of Teilhard de Chardin regarding the Soul of the universe in relation to our own. This book is highly recommended.

B003O85W3A|4.0|Arcade Fire has dropped out of sight in the last several months, so it's nice to see this insanely talented band make their grand reappearance. And their third album \\"The Suburbs\\" is a rich, retro-flavored expanse of truly transcendent music -- it starts off rather patchily, but soon it becomes a melodic hurricane of shimmering rock'n'roll.<br /><br />It starts off rather weakly with the title track, a rather bland piano-rocker. But things pick up with \\"Ready to Start,\\" which spins shimmering threads of keyboard around gritty earthy chords (\\"Businessmen drink my blood/Like the kids in art school said they would\\"). Honestly, this would have made a much better start to the album.<br /><br />And it sets the tone for the rest of the album -- meandering, bluesy rock'n'roll (\\"Modern Man,\\" \\"Month of May\\"), the stormy stretches of warbling keyboard and ringing guitars (\\"Rococo,\\" \\"Wasted Hours\\"), bittersweet guitar-pop (\\"Suburban War\\"), the elegant driving rock anthems (\\"Empty Rooms,\\" \\"We Used To Wait\\"), and languid indiepop around a catchy core (\\"City with No Children\\").<br /><br />The best songs of all are the two-part experimental ones: \\"Half Light Part I\\" is an exquisite twinkling little melody, and \\"Part II\\" is its darkly glittering counterpoint; on the other hand, \\"Sprawl (Flatland)\\" is a string-soaked, bittersweet song, with \\"Sprawl (Mountains Beyond Mountains\\" as its discoish companion.<br /><br />Apparently the central theme of \\"The Suburbs\\" is urban sprawl... which is not exactly a unique concept. But the Arcade Fire doesn't just explore the sprawl of suburbia with its \\"dead shopping malls\\" and lonely houses, but the loneliness of growing into adulthood and the life of an artist surrounded by \\"normal\\" people.<br /><br />As for the instrumentation, it's a little less indiepop and a little more rock'n'roll -- strong, shifting electric guitars and powerful chords, veiled with shimmering keyboard, strings and piano. And they throw in some brilliant flourishes here and there (the berserk strings in \\"Empty Room\\"). At the center of all this is Win Butler and R&eacute;gine Chassagne -- his falsetto voice murmurs through most of the songs, but is sometimes accompanied by her clear sweet one.<br /><br />And their brilliant lyrical skills are evident in every song -- there are some wicked bits of satire (\\"They seem wild but they are so tame/They're moving towards you with their colors all the same\\" -- take that, hipsters!), and exquisite lyricism (\\"Now the cities we live in could be distant stars/And I searched for you in every passing car\\").<br /><br />The Arcade Fire's \\"The Suburbs\\" takes a little while to fully warm up, but it ends up being a lonely, bittersweet exploration of an artist's life in suburbia.

B0024FADAQ|3.0|I'm still giving this a 3 star considering how long it was ago and it is quite an oldie, brings back memories.    However, to be blunt and truthful....it's a pretty crappy movie with a weak plot, weak group of highly underdeveloped characters and a plain storyline. How the story is setup makes it a bit hard to truly get into and leaves tons of holes yet to be covered. It really isn't a fantastic movie and a bit overrated due obviously to people that have watched this a long time ago and are recalling old memories again.    The ending is highly unconvincing and left much to be questioned.    Should you watch it? Sure! To be honest, many old movies range in this caliber, so nothing new. Just watch it and see how past movies were and how they are today, it's very interesting.

B003ITZBVI|4.0|This has to be the best of the DC animated films to date, along with Mask of the Phantasm and Return of the Joker.   I will warn people, it gets its PG-13 for a reason, due to its dark subject matter.   And young children most probably wouldn't be able to follow the story anyway.   I totally enjoyed the 75 min watching the film, and will definately be watching it again.
B003UMW68O|5.0|Imagine if there really WAS a monster living in every child's closet... and they had an excellent reason to be scary.<br /><br />And for anyone who has heard bumps in the night (adults or kids), \\"Monsters Inc\\" is a thoroughly delightful little animated movie that shows Pixar at its best. It has brilliant animation, delightful characters (\\"Mike Wazowski!\\"), and a really endearing storyline about a little kid who makes her way into the monster world.<br /><br />The monster metropolis of Monstropolis is powered by the screams of frightened children, which are gathered every night by specially-trained Scarers that pop out of closets. The top Scarer However, Monsters Inc. is suffering from a shortage, since kids are getting harder to scare.<br /><br />The top Scarer is James P. \\"Sully\\" Sullivan (who resembles The Beast with a bad blue dye job), accompanied by his talkative pal Mike Wazowski (who resembles a giant green grape with one big eyeball). But one night, Sully finds a child's door left activated on the scare floor... and while trying to hide from the treacherous Scarer Randall, he inadvertently lets a toddler into the monster world.<br /><br />Since children are considered to be toxic, the child (whom Sully named \\"Boo\\") causes a mass panic -- and somehow Sully and Mike have to find a way to return her to her own world without implicating themselves. But when Randall tries to strike a deal with Mike and Sully, the monster pals uncover a dangerous plot that could be deadly to both them... and Boo.<br /><br />Pixar has a way of making the weirdest plots seem natural and logical. Imagine a city populated by all sorts of weird creatures -- a jellyish creature that slips through a grate, a sluglike janitor who is constantly mopping his own slime, a giant chameleon, monster kids jumping rope with their playmate's long tongue, a Medusa-haired secretary, and the fuzzy-faced Adorable/Agreeable Snowman.<br /><br />The story is simple, quick-paced and full of physical comedy (mostly provided by Mike) and delightfully funny dialogue (\\"What happens when the whistle blows in five minutes?\\" \\"I get a time out?\\" \\"Everyone goes to LUNCH! Which means the scare floor will be....?\\" \\"... painted?\\"). There's a draggy section in the middle where Mike and Sully are racing around Monsters Inc., but the rest of the time it's a wild, funny little story (Sully having to sneak Boo into the bathroom).<br /><br />However, since this is Pixar, they manage to sneak some truly touching moments into the story -- Sully's paternal affection for Boo is really adorable, making it all the harder for him to think about sending her away. And Mike and Sully's relationship comes under stress because of it (\\"I am now stuck in this frozen WASTELAND!\\").<br /><br />John Goodman and Billy Crystal are simply PERFECT as Mike and Sully -- one is the enormous genial buddy-buddy, and the other is a shrill-voiced, high-strung little weirdo (\\"One of these days I am really... going to let you teach that guy a lesson!\\"). Steve Buscemi's Randall is deliciously bad (no misunderstandings or tragic backstory -- he's just bad. And Mary Gibbs (Boo), Jennifer Tilly and James Coburn all put out brilliant performances in their well-developed roles.<br /><br />It's whimsical, funny and a cute fantasy twist on the usual \\"working joe\\" environment -- \\"Monsters Inc\\" is one of those rare movies that the entire family (and not just the kids) can enjoy.y funny dialogue (\\"What happens when the whistle blows in five minutes?\\" \\"I get a time out?\\" \\"Everyone goes to LUNCH!

0439023491|4.0|As much as I enjoyed discovering and exploring the world of The Hunger Games in the first novel, I think I enjoyed this 2nd book in the trilogy a little less.  The story continues as heroine Katniss and her boyfriend Peeta embark on a victory tour following their unprecedented success in the last annual fight-to-the-death contest known as the Hunger Games.<br /><br />If you read The Hunger Games, you know that there is going to be some sort of fallout. Katniss after all is pretending to be in love with Peeta, she has to still pretend to be in love. She also suddenly loves Gale, when it seemed like they were only friends in The Hunger Games. Now it is Peeta or Gale, it seemed that she honestly she can't choose who.<br /><br />I did find that the violence and savagery of the games got to me after a bit. But the rest of the story makes up for that. It's almost 400 pages long, but I found it a fast and fun read

9889979942|5.0|I chanced upon a copy of Tom Carter's \\"China:Portait of a People\\" when someone handed it to me to look through it.  As a matter of habit, given the time, I always like to read through Author's notes before I introduce myself to their work.  In the Author's Introduction, Tom Carter says, \\"Where I have been, you will be; what I have seen, you will see.\\" And that is exactly what you get out of this book.<br /><br />In a time span of two years, the photographer covered 33 provinces of China - 36,000 km (1/3 of the country) and got introduced to 56 ethnicities. Quite a feat!<br /><br />What do you get from this book? A fresh approach and an unbiased perspective of a country we hear so much about in daily newsbytes, yet it remains a mystery. This book is second best option if you can't physically travel to the country and even if you did, you may not be able to see as much as you do with this book.<br /><br />Carter's camera's immediate attention is really on the \\"people\\" - he captures raw emotions through his lens.  I caught myself smiling back at some pictures, frowning with the people, ... interacting with the photographs as if I was seeing what the photographer was seeing!<br /><br />I look forward to more of Tom Carter's works in the future.
B002ZG9846|5.0|First off, I saw this in the theatre with my two teenagers and we loved this movie. This is a great film with a reality twist to it. I could not wait for the blu-ray to hit my house. We have watched it twice since it got here, today. All the people who gave it 1 star just complain about the violence and cursing. I have a suggestion for them. DO NOT WATCH RATED R MOVIES. Oh, and you shouldn't watch any show on HBO, Showtime, Cinemax, and Starz. You see these channel have a ton of shows that have cursing, violence and sex (the trifecta of badness, LOL).<br /><br />Anyway, this movie is about a kid that wants to be a hero because he is tired of just watching bad things happen around him. After trying it for a while he runs into some real heroes and decides it is too much for him. He is pulled back into it because the bad guy wants to make an example of him to the world. The story ends in triumph and with a warm and fuzzy feeling for all. This movie may not be anexact replica of the comic book, just as Watchmen wasn't an exact replica of its comic book. But if you know anything about the movie industry you would understand that not everything translates to the big screen from the written word.<br /><br />If you want to see some good action and a good story line than this movie is for you. It does not disappoint and the fact that all the 1 star reviews are just complaints about violence and cursing shoud let you know it is a good rated R movie.

1594488843|4.0|Carrots and sticks are so 20th century. We need to understand the drive to thrive in the 21st century. That's my twitter summary of Drive: The Surprising Truth About What Motivates Us by Daniel Pink.<br /><br />Summary<br />There is a great disconnect between what we practice in business - and I will add, in life - and what science is telling us in the area of motivation. The current model of motivation is carrots or sticks, money or termination. If-then rewards actually extinguish intrinsic motivation and diminish performance, crush creativity, and reduce good behavior. They also motivate people into behavior we do not want to see happen: unethical behavior, additions, and short-term thinking.<br /><br />While carrots and sticks are not the best motivators, they are not all bad, however. They can be effective for rule-based routine tasks that are not very interesting and do not demand much creative thinking, though their motivation is minimal.<br /><br />Science, however, shows us that we need to upgrade our operating system to motivation 3.0.<br /><br />The new OS has three essential elements: autonomy, mastery, and purpose.<br /><br />Autonomy \\"involves behaving with a full sense of volition and choice.\\" Motivation is different from independence. It is not the go-it-alone individualism of the American West. It means acting with a choice, meaning we can be both autonomous and happily interdependent with others. And more importantly, this is a human concept, not a Western one.<br /><br />Autonomy has a powerful effect on performance. It promotes great conceptual understanding, better grades, enhanced persistence at school and in sporting activities, higher productivity, less burnout, and greater levels of psychological well-being. In addition, autonomous people impact the workplace. A study by Cornell University demonstrated that businesses that offered autonomy grew at four times the rate of non-autonomous businesses and had one-third the turnover.<br /><br />The opposite of autonomy is control. Control leads to compliance; autonomy leads to engagement. Engagement leads to mastery, the desire to get better at something that matters. For the tasks of the 21st century, an inquiring mind and willingness to experiment to find a fresh solution is required. That means the ability to have autonomy over our tasks, techniques, team, and time. This all works to allow people to be engaged in their tasks and to master them.<br /><br />Autonomous people working toward mastery perform at very high levels. But those who do so in the service of some greater objective can achieve even more. The most deeply motivated people connect their desires to a cause larger than themselves.<br /><br />Thoughts<br />I really enjoy the writings of Daniel Pink. He assembles complicated research and makes it accessible to the masses. I appreciate how Pink makes the research in the areas of motivation easy for those who are not scientists to understand. In fact, in Drive, he does a magnificent job.<br /><br />Much of the background for this book comes from the research of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, a Hungarian psychology professor, who emigrated to the United States at the age of 22. Now at Claremont Graduate University, he is the former head of the department of psychology at the University of Chicago and of the department of sociology and anthropology at Lake Forest College. He is noted for his work in the study of happiness and creativity, but is best known as the architect of the notion of flow and for his years of research and writing on the topic. He is the author of many books and over 120 articles or book chapters. Martin Seligman, former president of the American Psychological Association, described Csikszentmihalyi as the world's leading researcher on positive psychology.<br /><br />I do a lot of church planter assessments and one of the things we look for is intrinsic motivation. This allows us to see what will keep them going when things get tough.It also allows us to determine if money is a primary motivator. Drive provides us with the research behind the importance of this needed tool for church planting. And for ministry in the 21st century as well.<br /><br />Drive is also a marker for entrepreneurial ministry. And entrepreneurialism in general.<br /><br />The book is easy to read despite its topic. It makes good use of emerging research. But it's a very practical book as well. At the end of the book, Pink provides a toolkit. In it, he provides strategies for awakening motivation for individuals, parents, educators, and businesses. He provides a great reading list of 15 essential books to encourage and promote a healthy environment for autonomy, mastery, and purpose. He also provides a discussion guide to get the discussion started.<br /><br />This is a fabulous book, and will be effective for leaders and followers alike. Whether you are a pastor, small group leader, or business person, this will help motivate those you lead and even help you understand yourself better.arch behind the importance of this needed tool for church planting.

B002ZG98VE|5.0|I had been following this films release for a long time, and remember really wanting to see it when it first came out.  I can't explain what a huge Robin Hood fan that I was as a kid.  I had the all green motif in my room until I was about 8.  I remember reading the Pyle version of the story, well before I was old enough to do so, but as the film approached release, due mostly to bad press, and a really bad trailer that came out right before release (note that trailers are not usually made by the actual film makers, so why people base their expectations on them, to include myself is beyond me.)  it was being marketed to a historically accurate version of Robin Hood.  How it could actually have happened, which is just another way of saying we b sed and speculated, kinda like that horrible clive owen version of king arthur.  Something in the vain of glaidiator but with robin hood, roll eyes.  This film is not that.  I missed the initial release and ended up seeing it for free in a second run theater, and I have to say that I was mesmorized.  It was really good. Not like best movie of the year good, but thoroughly entertaining, and it took some liberties that I was not expecting.  A lot of people say, oh great a sequel, some say there can't be a sequel of robin hood, because its an idea, a folklore, kind of like batman.  Different directors have focused on different parts of the mythology, because there are so many different sources to choose from.  I always thought that the Pyle version was the original book, but have subsequently found there are like at least 10 very different versions ranging from shakespeare, to Dumas, to Tolken C.S. Lewis Oxford alum, so with that in mind, this is its own telling.  In most original versions, Robin does his thing, as a commoner, becomes an outlaw to be pardoned by the king, go off to fight in the crusades, and come back to sherwood, maybe fight a last battle, and then die after defeating sherriff of nottingham. This film starts with robin as a soldier, who comes back after the war, trying to find the peace that has eluded him in life.  Will and Little John are other Veterans, and the saying that no one wants peace like a soldier holds true.  They fight for the people who couldn't go fight, and who can't stand up to the government.  There are various allusions to the current conflicts and low approvals of current policies.  While the story of robin may not be historically accurate, the way it is told is.  All the customs and set pieces are the most accurate representation of the time yet put on film, and it does stem from Ridly Scott's maticulous eye for historical detail.  This does lend itself to be a film for the whole family, and roots Robin's uprising on modern ideals and rebels agains English rule and oppression.  There is no King left to pardon robin in this.  The film's story doesn't travel as far as I would have liked, but it it definately a prequel, and since he ultimately must fail in liberating england, I think the subsequent sequels will be most interesting as robin's ideals, and his men's loyalties to them are questioned under the rule of king John.  I hope that more people get into this film, because I really thing that with writer Brian Hedgeland of LA Confidential and Mystic River Penning this series, the next film could be ever bit as good as the dark knight, though I'm afraid with the poor boxoffice it might never be.
1416562605|5.0|By way of giving advice to the Chinese Premier in a series of letters, Bahram Halwai seeks to show him how entrepreneurship and democracy, which are extolled in the west, play out in India. Halwai recounts his own experiences which give readers insight into the life, thoughts and feelings that most likely characterize the many caught in the lower rungs in India's caste and economic systems.<br /><br />From the \\"Darkness\\" where the work and meager resources of its indigent residents have been extracted by a ruthless family, Halwai raises himself up to Bangalore. His father was a rickshaw puller; he becomes a driver to the very family that controls the destiny of the poor in this town, and later an entrepreneur.<br /><br />Halwai sees the poor as living in a Rooster Coop, kept there by a code of ethics and behavior that allows them to be the world's best servants.  Jobs are scarce and they must grovel and be beyond reproach in honesty and loyalty to those who play by different rules. He shows that even the more enlightened elite will easily trade off a servant who has fully demonstrated his role-required code.<br /><br />Adiga's India shows the scramble for limited resources. Democracy is manipulated by money at the top and this ethos filters down through the entire system.<br /><br />It appears that this is a first novel, winning the Booker prize right out of the gate. I see there is a second, [[ASIN:1439153167 Between the Assassinations]], with equally high Amazon reviewer scores. The first person narration of this is reminiscent of Mohsid Hamid's two excellent novels, [[ASIN:0312273231 Moth Smoke: A Novel]] and  [[ASIN:B001VEHZZ2 The Reluctant Fundamentalist]].  I hope Adiga is more prolific.
B0025UHKNS|4.0|I have been running with a polar RS200 with a foot pod for about 6 years now, and it finally started to die on me.  I went to replace it with another similar unit but was turned onto the Garmin 405cx instead.  I was a bit reluctant to change, mostly because of the price difference, but I liked the idea of not needing a foot pod and REALLY liked the idea of tracking distance by satellite instead.      I have to say that you really need to read the extended manual that you download from the website.  The \\"quick start\\" manual that comes with the unit might be enough to get you started but there is a lot of other stuff to know.  I had a pretty easy time setting it all up, and even though the menus seem a bit complicated, the way they are set up now seems more logical than the Polar menus.  The other feature that is better than the Polar are the customizable displays.  You can have up to 3 different pieces of information in each view, and there is an entire host of things to chose from such as speed, pace, time, heart rate, elevation, etc.  They can even tell you sunrise and sunset times in your area!      When I actually went for a run the first time, it took forever to locate satellites, but after that it now takes about 15 seconds. Once I finished my workout, I found the distance tracking was much more accurate than my foot pod on the Polar unit.  When I walked into my apartment, I looked at my computer and the ANT unit was already transferring data from my watch to my computer.  FABULOUS!     I like that I can use the GPS on the watch without my chest strap, as well.  I like to walk a lot since I live in a city, and now I can use the watch to track how far I go (without needing a foot pod).    My only gripes (hence 4 stars and not 5):      1)  I wish the maps on the computer software were a bit more detailed.      2)  I'm small boned so the watch is really BIG on my wrist!  I may try the included velcro wrist straps instead of the rubber ones to see if it helps withthe fit.      All in all I'm very pleased with my purchase!
B000OPO6VU|5.0|Would have to say this is my favorite classic rock album.  Listening to this is a near religious experience as used to listen to it alot in the 70s.  It really grows on you and the more you listen to it(the vinyl album is best) the more you appreciate it.  Rock on
B000092T6M|5.0|This was the Robin Hood movie when I was growing up.  Allong with the Disney animated version, this movie is what I judge all other things Robin Hood by.  I remember when I first knew about this film coming out, when the toys first hit the toy store.  I wasn't old enough to corolate the toys to a new film, but i remember that they had real strings with plastic arrows you could shoot, and cloth robes detachable wristbands.  The summer it came out, it was everywhere.  In the cereal, at burgerking.  As a kid I was enthralled the whole film from beginning to end.  The movie never slows down, because even during the dialogue scenes, the characters are always in movement, and being firey.  Maid Marrion sticks up for herself, as I have seen her portraid in each subsequent version of the film.  The sherriff of this version is thee sherriff and one of the best hollywood villains of all time.  I remember everyone loved this movie, and when it came out on VHS, everyone owned a copy and everyone played it at family functions and the like.  Until the mid nineties you just couldn't escape this film.  I remember by the end of its run I was starting to really get tired of it, but it still holds a special place for me.  It was very current when it came out.  Strong female lead, making sure to put a likable ethnic character, though what the Moors where doing in Arabia during that time I may never know, but I guess a black actor was more accepted at the time than an Arab, who spouts wisdom about god being color blind.  They make sure that he makes a fool of robin so that he is not just the side kick.  Considering that at the time there was a contenent wide war with muslims at the time, it wasn't just an issue of race as alluded to in the film, but a general hatred and fear of foreign ideology, I don't see the reactions being as light as introverted as portrayed in the film, but more reflective of 90's post \\"Do the Right Thing\\" Culture.  At the time this movie was cutting edge, which of course dates it now, and there is enough there to make the more PC of us cringe, but as a children's adventure story, I don't think a more fun adaptation exists.  One more thing, people complain about the accents, and though I understand the complaints, this is not a historical piece.  This is a fantasy for children and the young at heart for a legend.  When I would play Robin Hood in the back yard there were no accents, nor did I expect there to be.  We don't expect period pieces to be in King's English, because they wouldn't be as accessable.  this movie is very accessable and fun.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|Quit whining that this show didn't answer ALL questions.  If you want a show like that watch a half-hour sitcom.  Great beginning, great middle, great end.  5-stars......enough said.
B0008ENICU|5.0|Wealthy married women don't seem to have much to do except cause trouble in their marriages and with each other.  A great vehicle for many of the great MGM actresses in the 30s and a lot of fun too.  Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Joan Fontaine, Marjorie Main star in this All Star cast.  There are no men in this film, just plain acting fun.  What a wonderful movie and one of the many in the great Hollywood year, 1939.
B0032Y8XH8|4.0|Heard Little Lion Man on the radio and had to have the album.  I would have to agree about the lyrics, which is why I wouldn't give it 5 stars.  Musically, it is the best thing I have heard in a long time, especially the banjo. Can't wait for their sophomore album.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I was able to put the camera, 5 lenses (and one of them was a 300mm) and a bunch of accessories in the bag easily.  I even clip my tripod to the straps on the side of the backpack.  Great for DSLR users!
B003OF3R0S|2.0|Hey, I have been a huge fan forever, I love avenged sevenfold. I have been waiting forever to buy this and listen to it. Gotta say, I listened to it a couple times now, but it just seems mediocre. Im trying to be upbeat about it and get really into it, but I just cant. Songs are slow and boring, I swear three of the songs have the exact same chorus with m shadows screaming in a certain way. The song god hates us is good, but the best song on the cd is the first one(nightmare) that the rev wrote. And not to be mean to the other guys but its obvious rev didnt help with the other songs. It saddens me to know the rev will never again help in their cd's. I only hope they get some help from someone for their nrxt cd.
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I'm not sure where to start but this album haunts me daily. It's awesome rock and roll merged with life to the the greatest. If you love rock then you'll love the melodies and under tones of the musics. If you are looking for something creative and authentic then this is it. It doesn't get any better.    Alterbridge introduced themselves, and perfected the sound in this album. Stay tuned... There's more to come.    Totally awesome.
B000022TSV|5.0|Although not entirely faithful to Bizet's opera, this is a passionate, realistic, colorful and sensual movie that I enjoyed very much.  Placido Domingo is in fine form as the doomed Don Jose-his tragic transformation from straight-laced soldier to desperate madman is believeable. Julia Migenes is a sexy and commanding Carmen who has a great on-screen chemistry with Domingo.  Ruggerio Raimondi is perfect as the swaggering bullfighter Escamillo.  Faith Esham is amazing as Don Jose's sweetheart Michaela - her Act 3 aria is one of the great moments of the film.  5 Stars!

Dreams of peaceful nature with Charlie and Gonzalo and friends. Tutti frutti melodies in touch with the sea caressing the shore. The smell of a cigar in the distance with patio acacias. Tunes representing purity and endurance of the soul with a touch of grace and sorrow. Did i put you to sleep? or was it the stupor of the sound and smell combination i just described, i know, pure paradise...

1416972250|5.0|How exciting was this book?! It really kept me on my toes. There are some things that are revealed that readers definitely saw coming, but I think the point was that the characters didn't...and that still made things intense. Fans will be relieved to discover (beyond a shadow of doubt) that Jace and Clary are not brother and sister! *wipes sweat from brow* Clary and Jace discover what makes them so special, and why they are capable to do things other Shadowhunters cannot.<br /><br />I loved the fact that we got to visit Idris and gain more insight to the various sects of downworlders including Luke's family. We also meet the rest of the Lightwood family and their storyline is heartbreaking. In fact, this book is full of gut wrenching moments and poignant revelations. However, even in the midst of some emotional scenes and adrenaline pumping fights, the author realizes the importance of adding a touch of humor to the mood, and Isabelle and Magnus are right on hand delivering some fantastic, memorable lines. Clare tied up all the loose ends and left me longing for more story...thank goodness for the Epilogue.<br /><br />Ahhh...the Epilogue. I have heard a lot of different opinions on the Epilogue at the end of the story. Some opinions were ranting about the scene with the Fairy Queen, some unsatisfied with the lack of intimacy shown between Jace & Clary, some were just belly aching in general. My take on it is this...I am pretty sure that the scenes are important to the story Clare was telling, otherwise why would she have included them at all. I personally wasn't ready to say \\"The End\\" and was thrilled to read the added pages with more information about the characters that I had grown so attached to. I liked it and devoured every word. Imagine how excited I was to discover that Cassandra Clare wasn't finished with the characters and was writing another book in the series, City of Fallen Angels and a prequel, Clockwork Angel. *squee*<br /><br />Be sure to pick up a Paperback copy of City of Glass this week to get an exclusive sneak peek of the fourth book in the Mortal Instruments series: City of Fallen Angels!

B000O77SRC|5.0|Okay, this is one of those action films that really works. Alongside Speed & Face/Off, Die Hard is superb as it delivers a whole lot of high-octane action. The story is...well, who really cares about the story? You already know that it's a bit cliched and doesn't really offer anything fresh. But what's so obviously great about this film is the action. The gunfights and the explosions (as well as the stunt work) are spectacular, and many of the action sequences still hold up today. Both Bruce Willis & Alan Rickman are excellent as the hero & villain, though I do think that the villain here, named Gruber, is way more interesting than Willis himself. Rickman's character is still the best villain in the entire Die Hard series, and his suave but cynical appearance/personality is proof of that. So basically, Die Hard is one of those action films that you MUST see before you die. It's got what you would expect in an action film: intense gun battles, clever dialogue, and a mano-a-mano between Willis and Rickman. The only problem is the music, which can be quite over-the-top at times. But still, this film is solid.<br /><br />Grade: A-
0375842209|5.0|I have tried several times to write a review on this book, each time my words fail me. I do not pretend to be a talented wordsmith, I have good friends who shine when putting thought to pen, and I am well aware of where my limitations are. That being said, I had the need to share this book with everyone. As strongly as I felt about this story I knew I had to forge through and put my best effort forth so others could experience it with me.<br /><br />Haunting, grim, touching, thoughtful, sweet, scary, there are so many emotions this story evokes... where do I begin?<br /><br />Well, I suppose I start with Death.<br /><br />Death is at the forefront of this story, not only because of the period in history when death is everywhere but because \\"Death\\" is this tale's narrator. It is Nazi Germany at the very begining of one of humanities worst hours. Death begins to narrate this story as \\"an attempt--a flying jump of an attempt--to prove to me that you, and your human existence, are worth it.\\" We are given a whole new image to the \\"death\\" image we the people see. Death begins the story of the book thief, Liesel Meminger when he first meets her on a cold train. Liesel and her brother are being sent to a foster home by their Communist mother when she is interned in Dachau Concentration Camp. Death takes The Book Thief's brother and at the cold burial site he watches as Leisel steals a book for the first time as her brothers body is being laid to rest. Though she cannot read she treasures the words the book (The Gravedigger's Handbook) hold and keeps the book hidden from prying eyes. Soon after she arrives at the home of foster parents, Hans and Rosa Hubermann.<br /><br />Liesel is at a disadvantage compared to the other children that live on Himmel street. She is malnourished, small for her age, and behind in her schooling. She is teased by many of the other children in the neighborhood but finds a true friend in Rudy Steiner, the blond boy that idolizes Jesse Owens and is always asking Liesel for a kiss. Even with the addition of a friend in her life Liesel is plagued with nightmares. She is comforted by her foster father who sits up with her at night to keep the bad dreams away. Hans begins to teach Liesel to read at night when she is awakened by the terrors in her dreams.<br /><br />The Book Thief settles into her new life on Himmel street (which ironically translates to Heaven street) and though things are not easy they grow comfortable until the arrival of Max. Max's presence in the household is one that threatens her new comfort but she is drawn to the man that stays hidden in her basement. She learns that Max suffers from nightmares as she does and soon finds a kindred spirit in him.<br /><br />Liesel learns the value of having a voice and knowing how to read from the beginning of the book. She also realizes that words are what hold the country under the power of Hitler and the Nazi party. The theme is recurring: Hans teaches her to read at night, the mayor's wife allows her into the library, and Max gives her two books he wrote himself. As well as being the source of her strife, literature becomes Liesel's escape from her bleak life.<br /><br />Markus Zusak has written a book with such imagery woven into his words that you truly begin to see the book come to life. He gave this novel a pulse and it breathes. Perhaps this is why I find it so difficult to articulate my thoughts. I experienced this book with more than just my eyes. I didn't just read this book, I FELT this book. I heard the voices of the characters, their accents, the sounds of the street and the sounds of the war echo in my head. I could smell the bonfire smoke from the books being burned, the dank smell of the cold moldy basement where Max stayed, and the smell of the trees where Liesel and Rudy would steal apples. Most importantly though, I can close my eyes tight at this very moment and see snap shots of scenes from the book, almost like looking through an oldphoto album.<br /><br />Very rarely do I come across a book with such weight that it makes me turn the mirror toward my own soul and reflect. This book is powerful, moving, brilliant and lingers in your very being.h such weight that it makes me turn the mirror toward my own soul and reflect.

This is good,   but I don't agree with Sam's shaved head look   because they didn't have barbers back then.   This dvd has nice picture and sound, but only   deleted scenes and I wish it had the alternate   ending that's on the blu-ray. I recommend this.

B001UV4XFG|4.0|Still an action packed movie with some beautiful scenes. I would have loved to see more development between Bella and Jacob, though. I did think the wolves looked stunning and the movie was fast pasted. I was hoping for a mix of the romance of Twilight with the action of New Moon. Curious to see Breaking Dawn.
B0015AARJI|1.0|I bought the PS3 console new about a year ago.  I'm not an avid gamer, maybe just a few hours a week.  Well my controller that was included with the console worked great for about 6 months...then randomly during game play all of a sudden the controller would act as though i'm rotating the analog stick....even though i wouldn't even be touching the controller!  I attempted to get a refund/exhange through Sony but they were no help as i hadn't purchased an extended warranty.  Okay fine, so about 3 weeks ago I bought a brand new controller from Best Buy.  And here I am now...after not even putting 15 hours of use in...the controller is DEAD!  A few days ago I noticed it would not charge.  And when the power finally drained, it just died.  No lights, nothing.  I've tried USB Ports in my computers to try re-charging. Nothing.  Opened it up to inspect the battery connection.  Nope.  And YES i hit the reset button on the back.  I'm very disappointed in the quality.  When I pay a steep price for a controller, i expect it to last for at least a year (even more since i don't even play too often).  And FINALLY, my STUPID! mistake: I had faith that this new controller would work so i tossed the receipt!  Dumbass...ehhh.  Oh well, guess im off to blow another 55 bucks on a controller.  I'm keepin my papers this time!<br /><br />UPDATE August 22nd: I Finally figured out the issue.  I Recently updated the firmware on my PS3 and it's THAT that caused my problems with the NEWER controller.  The new firmware has disabled my consoles ability to charge the controller.  So i went out and blew 30 bucks on a stand alone PS3 controller charger.  But this still doesn't explain my original controller went haywire after only 6 months of light use.  But if u can help it, do not upgrade the firmware!!!

0307454541|1.0|A dear and respected friend gifted me with this novel. I cannot express how deeply I loathed it, though much of that was for many of the same reasons already noted in one-star reviews here.<br /><br />Any further words I give to reviewing this book contributes to the illusion that it is worth any attention whatever. All I will add to the one-star reviews--and I wish it could be zero stars--is this:<br /><br />It's not for nothing that they call it *Stockholm* Syndrome.<br /><br />And Mr. Larsson has found a way to cash in on it bigtime in readers. The five-star reviews will show you how.
0385339682|3.0|I liked the changes that took place in the south in ten years. I liked learning about the day to day goings on at a newspaper. I listened to it in one day. But the black characters felt cliched and one dimensional.

1591841666|5.0|Anyone who thinks that the message in this book is obvious, facile or superficial hasn't read it closely. If you truly implement the lessons in this book, it will put you through some *profound* soul-searching. Seth Godin challenges us to make difficult, painful, but ultimately enormously rewarding life decisions, about work, relationships, any structure of your life. He calls us to be brutally honest about our pointless attachments, our dead-end-give-it-up-already hopes and dreams. It demands that we *grow up*, acknowledging the very real cost of commitment to the path we truly care about. This book ain't for sissies, for dilettantes or for people who can't face facts. If you have the guts to truly come to terms with the message of this book, then congratulations. You are about to be set free, to live a truly authentic life.

0307454541|4.0|I decided to read this book after reading about it in my favorite magazine, Entertainment Weekly. The never ending praise by this magazine, and also the fact that the book was very obviously displayed in every bookstore I walked into, made me buy it.<br /><br />I knew right from the start that this book would be a challenge. However, I enjoyed it and I'm glad I gave it a try.<br /><br />My review for this book will come in three parts.<br /><br />1. The beginning. The beginning of any book is without a doubt the most important part of it. Every book needs to have an attention-grabbing opening. Without that, an average reader could easily get bored or disinterested and move onto something more exciting. I came thisclose to giving up before the story got under way. Why? Because of the mumbo jumbo. I have no interest in the stock market or economics, and so when this book started out with some long explanations about some financial scandal, I had half a mind to give up right then and there.<br /><br />2. The middle. This is the bulk of the book, and the only reason why I stuck with it. Once the story got going (and it took a little too long for my taste) I decided that I really wanted to see what happened. The character of Mikael Blomkvist didn't interest me too much, but the story he was investigating did. I found myself pulled in by the murder mystery that the book was trying to solve. I also became very intrigued by the idea of Lisbeth Salander. True to my expectations, she was as bad-ass as everything I had heard about her, and naturally that made her my favorite character.<br /><br />3. The ending. Besides the part where the main mystery of Harriet Vanger's murder was solved, I skim-read the end. It was more mumbo jumbo, and a whole lot of something I didn't feel like reading. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the very last page, and the incredible cliff-hanger that was presented. Is it enough for me to read the sequel? Maybe.<br /><br />Overall: This book is not for everybody. If you think you can handle a book with a lot of backstory, I'd say go for it. I also have to add that there are some very graphic sexual abuse scenes, so this is not a story for a young reader. The best person to read this would be an adult with an open mind, and a desire to read an interesting and different story.a book with a lot of backstory, I'd say go for it.

1416550550|3.0|The story was compelling at the beginning... but left me underwhelmed at the end. It just didn't dig deep enough, despite it's length. Everything wrapped up all nicely and neatly, with the characters never really having to work for it. People had an uncanny ability to remember names, dates, and events from nearly 100 years prior and often had documentation or artifacts to back-up their stories. If the characters were in need of an answer, it was quickly supplied... \\"I wonder what was in the clay pot?\\" \\"I don't know, what could it be?\\" \\"Oh, look, I just found the clay pot.\\" Okay, not exactly like that, but close enough. And the entire time I kept wanting to go back and reread The Secret Garden. Having said all that, I didn't hate it -- but do question the rave reviews.
B000RK3JOC|4.0|I'd like to begin this review by saying that John Green is a fabulous author, and if you haven't read anything by him, then you need to pick up any one of his books, pronto.<br /><br />Now, onto the review. An Abundance of Katherines did not disappoint. This is what I was expecting: an amazing, funny, and insightful book. What did I get? An amazing, funny, and insightful book.<br /><br />I loved the characters. Colin was such a geek, and I love that about him. His friend Hassan was hilarious, and they were both wonderfully realistic.<br /><br />I loved the humor, and also the footnotes were such an awesome way to share extra tidbits of insight. Books with footnotes have something special. (See: The Boyfriend List; Bad Kitty)<br /><br />The insight was also incredible. It didn't sound at all preachy, like some books are. It was just a revelation made by a guy who wants to figure his life out. I really loved how things turned out for Colin!<br /><br />There is only one bit of criticism, and that is that the book was predictable. However, I enjoyed it enough and was intrigued enough by the journey, that the predictable ending didn't bother me too much.<br /><br />Overall, it was wonderful! Definitely give it a shot!
B002P5XXR0|3.0|Don't take me wrong. The soundtrack is good but it lacks freshness in my opinion. I've been a fan of Horner's work since \\"Krull\\" and ever since I've heard him rehash some of his best stuff. There are easily identifiable nuances from \\"Krull\\" in \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan\\" (Horner's best work to date in my opinion) as there are distinctive elements from \\"The Abyss\\" present on \\"Braveheart\\", and some from the latter here and there in \\"Titanic\\". Now, for \\"Avatar\\", Horner has gathered up some of his earlier ammo and fired it up (and mixed it with other things in the process, like the \\"Adiemus\\"-like vocal chants). A trend adopted by some contemprary film composers (Hans Zimmer, anyone?) either to capitalize on the effectiveness of previous compositions or to compensate for lack of creativity. You decide.    Khan's motif is copied note by note to some parts of \\"Scorched Earth\\", for example. Some highly-percussive passages on the battle sequences are too reminiscent of both \\"The Abyss\\" and \\"Braveheart\\" while others (particularly on the \\"War\\" track) have a strong resemblance to \\"The Wrath of Khan\\".    The score has an overall \\"new age-y\\" flavour, which suits the film just fine. However, besides the theme song's melody, which is cited throughout the score, I can't think of a melody that sticks to you; one you can remember and hum. In contrast, composers like Jerry Goldsmith, John Williams and Howard Shore (among others) use themes for specific situations or characters within a film that you can easily identify and remember (the Klingon theme from \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\", Vader's march from Star Wars, Gondor's theme from \\"The Return of the King\\", etc.). So... like many other new age works, this score in its majority provides a nice, lush, soothing atmosphere, but little solid musical substance.    If you have the money to spare, buy the Extended Edition (or whatever it's called) that costs a few bucks more but has some complimenting tracks that are well worth theextra dough.    Again, this is a fine score. It won't blow you away, but it's very pleasant to listen to.

0783225482|4.0|I agree with the assesment that this movie is awesome, but it should be on Blu-Ray, since the visuals are its main attraction. This film won multiple special effects awards (including the Oscar) so it's downright criminal for it to only be in *grainy DVD* form.<br /><br />Who's with me?!
B001EN71CW|5.0|Firefly was one of the best shows on TV in the last 20 years.    It is a shame that Fox gave up on it so quickly when other less quality shows remained.    It seems like Fox did not know how to properly market Firefly so by the time many found out about the show it was already gone.    Anyway this Blu-ray release of the series is excellent!    The fact that Amazon had a sale price of $27.99 was fantastic.    I highly recommend this series!
B00004XPPE|4.0|Even after all these years--after devouring the novel way back in high school, then watching this film on several occasions--FAIL-SAFE still feels like a body blow to the midsection.  It literally sucks the air right out of you.  It brings back vivid memories of living in the Cold War Era (yep, I'm older than dirt); of \\"duck and cover\\" drills in school; of constant fear and anxiety that someone--either on this continent or across the world in Red Square--would push that red button and life would forever be changed. . .if it survived at all.<br /><br />FAIL-SAFE brings it all back.<br /><br />An equipment malfunction.  A glitch.  And suddenly a group of American fighter pilots armed with nukes are \\"ordered\\" to leave their Fail-Safe checkpoint and proceed to Moscow--no matter who, or what, comes over their radios to attempt to persuade them to go back.  And these guys are well trained.  And their radar jamming and masking technology works just fine; it's inevitable at least one of them will make it through to the target.  So what must the U.S. do to convince the Soviet Union it's all a horrific mistake and avoid a nuclear holocaust?<br /><br />Thus the tension is created, augmented by director Sidney Lumet's craftsmanship as a filmmaker.  Close-ups.  Angled camera shots.  Silhouette lighting.  Everything to ratchet up the tension and drama.  The cast is exceptional, led by Henry Fonda as the President--a stoic commander-in-chief who must make a terrible decision affecting the lives of millions.  Other cast members include Walter Matthau playing a war hawk political scientist, a very young Larry Hagman as Fonda's Russian interpreter, and a young, pudgy Dom DeLuise in a brief role as a nervous sergeant. One star deducted for the needless, contrived melodrama that periodically thrusts its way to the forefront (alas, that's how flicks were made in those days).  For those who haven't seen FAIL-SAFE, and who want to watch a tense, compelling, engrossing film, this is right down your alley.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoningikels, Author, The Reckoning
B002VPE1Z2|4.0|This is a nice little camera case which I use for my digital camera; this features firm polyester exterior and a soft interior to keep the camera protected from bumps and scrapes. Some reviewers have said that this is a little large for an electronic camera, but I find this is just about right size. It has a small zippered exterior pocket that can store batteries or memory cards. I travel moderately and use this during my trips and I am quite satisfied with this product.
B003C1QIO6|3.0|Jack is always great but, after the stellar Sleep Through the Static I was expecting a little more. There is simply nothing that stands out as amazing on this album.
B003S9WC6U|1.0|I was disappointed that the author, a woman of science, would look at her vascular incident in such a subjective manner.  This book was hailed as a breakthrough in the field of neuroscience.  It seems to me to be just a thinly veiled religious text that, like others of its type, proves that God does, in fact, exist.  If I wanted to read about religion, I would go to the religion section of the store.  I enjoy reading books on psychology and neuroscience, but I don't feel that this book should be found in the science section.
014144116X|3.0|In the 1920s, British officials were living in India, in an insular community in which they could enjoy the comforts of British life while dictating proper rules and justice to the inferior Indians.  Problems abounded from both sides, naturally.      The British officials feared they were not well respected enough.  They didn't make an effort to get to know individual Indians, and stereotypes ruled their thinking.    The Indians were resentful of the occupation, but unwilling or unable to do much about it.    Into this touchy atmosphere a young British woman and her older female escort materialize.  The young woman is the potential fiance of a British official, and has come to India to decide if she truly wishes to marry him.  The older woman is the official's mother.    As newcomers, the women are fascinated by India; it is far more interesting than the British community plunked down in the middle of it.  They don't understand conventions, don't understand why they can't mix socially with Indians, don't understand the rules that the other British seem to take for granted.  As a result, they end up going on an outing with a friendly and eager-to-please Indian doctor.    While on the outing, something strange and frightening occurs.  The British community use the opportunity to villainize the Indian host, and it appears that the tenuous peace and harmony between Indians and British might be lost.    The themes of this book and its overall story are though-provoking and well written.  I had a very difficult time with the characters, though, who seemed completely unreal.  Aziz, despite being a doctor, seemed so weak and childlike, unable to take a stand or make up his mind about things.  I couldn't figure out Adele's motivation at all, either for being in the country in the first place, since she seemed to have no feelings for Ronny, or for letting herself be steamrolled into accusations she didn't mean.  I could see clearly, being able to peek into the thoughts of both the Indians and the British, the misunderstandings that occurred throughout much of the book, but I wish I'd been able to gain more insight into what actually motivated these characters, and get a deeper sense of who they were as individuals.
B0007Y89ZM|3.0|Not a particularly \\"exciting\\" event but worthwhile.  They missed many of their better songs in lieu of lesser songs like Pretty Maids or Wasted Time.  The Last Resort, also a lesser tune, was actually pretty good.  Hotel California was the highlight.  I enjoyed Joe Walsh the most in his goofy sort of way, although he wasn't as silly and goofy as I've seen in other events.  The whole affair was very subdued with only three songs really rocking; In The City, Life In The Fast Lane and Get Over It.  I enjoyed their \\"Last Farewell\\" DVD more, I would recommend that instead of this one.
B003TOH8AE|5.0|Struggling coming of age teenagers (Youth Revolt) coupled with original, very cool action scenes (Wanted). Not for kids (lots of death) or chicks (lots of death), but perfect for dudes. Very unexpected everything.  Thumbs way up.
0385474547|4.0|Things Fall Apart is aptly titled. The world is a changing place, and the ingrained customs of today may fade with your children even though they seem strong as you yourself carry them out.<br /><br />To be honest, I find the Ibo culture distasteful in many ways. These are perhaps modern sentimentalities, if not liberal or Christian ones. I am not going to commend this work as a scathing indictment of colonialism or as an exaltation of diversity. This story has deep roots in other ways for me. It reminds me a little of The Mists of Avalon, although a shorter and more Hemingway-esque version of it. Clearly this same story can be told in many ways across many cultures, and surely Christianity will suffer the same fate as Okonkwo and Morgaine's Gods.<br /><br />It all falls apart, eventually.
B003J27WFW|5.0|First - the scene where Alex talks about dropping out was from \\"Come On Children\\", a documentary by Allan King from 1972. It predated reality TV - 10 troubled teens living on a farm for 10 weeks. It's actually going to be released on Criterion DVD in September as part of \\"The Actuality Dramas of Allan King\\".     It's a wealth of info on a band that has been together over 40 years, how two guys from high school bonded and through pure hard work and opportunity, paved their own road to success, and there were a lot of bumps along the way. They explain why the first drummer left, they also had unbelievable love and support from their parents, which is what really came through to me. Their manager Ray also talks a lot about life on the road. A lot of big names in music are on here, but it was actually Gene Simmons and Rush discussing touring together - you realize that tour in particular put them on the map.     There's more focus on the rise to success, than when they hit it big in the early 80s when \\"Moving Pictures\\" took them to another level. But they do discuss the loss of privacy (the part where Geddy and Alex go to a restaurant is hilarious, and Neil boasts being able to be anonymous yet be around people), and the fans.      Of course, Neil was hit with unbelievable tragedy in the late 90s, and because Neil's already written about it in \\"Ghost Rider\\", Alex and Geddy are left to discuss it in the film, as well as the band getting back on its feet in 2002. Their appearance on Colbert is also mentioned. I think the only part missing that should've been included was the Toronto Rocks benefit.     All in all, an excellent documentary for fans of Rush as well as any music documentary for that matter.     Interesting tidbit - the 1974 rare footage with Rutsey, was filmed in St Catherines. Neil Peart's hometown. And even though it's not mentioned here, Rolling Stone finally interviewed Rush in 2008.. of course Rush wasn't on the cover (Obama was).     Once you're done watching it, you're going to be compelled to listen to their music. Without a doubt.
0061537969|5.0|This is not a book for dog/animal lovers. True, it is from the perspective of an animal, which makes the narration interesting, but honestly I think people who are into cars would be more appreciative than members of PeTA.<br /><br />I see this word used often in conjunction with female-oriented novels, but the word \\"heartfelt\\" hits the mark when it comes to The Art of Racing in the Rain. It is philosophical and spiritual, but written in simple and understandable terms, with many moments of sweetness and good one-liners that made me giggle. I've heard some complaints that this book was depressing, but it does have a happy ending, and a book isn't much of a book without conflict, so don't be disheartened when you're halfway through it and the situation keeps getting worse and worse.<br /><br />It was intelligent, appealing, insightful, and I will definitely buy my own copy.
B002NXSRX4|1.0|This movie is so cartoonish and the acting is so poor that I couldn't finish watching it, which is saying something since I have a high tolerance for BS.  This one was over my limit.
0439023483|4.0|The Hunger Games was a pleasant surprise. Some plot points were painfully obvious from the beginning, but there is a tendency to get so wrapped up in the NOW, that you might not even notice something until you're right on top of it.<br /><br />I agree that the premise is brutal...philosophically, for a dystopian young adult novel, The Giver is better in execution; if it's action (and romance) you're out for, try the Hunger Games. I find the present tense annoying, but I rather rarely see that device used and it probably does a lot to add to the immediacy and pace. I won't say that it was written in such a way as to make me particularly emotional about any of it, but I will say it was a fun ride.<br /><br />As to the brutality of it, I think I was expecting a bit worse. But I'm a jaded adult, and this book is not written for adults. I also think the ending could have been wrapped up more neatly while still reasonably leading into the next two, but it also wasn't the most annoying cliffhanger I've ever seen. I do believe I will read the next two, though I'm not tripping all over myself to get to hit the \\"buy now\\" button on my Kindle.<br /><br />Truly, I got more out of it than I expected.
B003JYOFIW|5.0|This is the d-evolved Devo that we all wanted in the '80's but were afraid to ask for. This is perhaps the most relevant album of 2010, the songs are layered and the lyrics textured with wisdom about the human condition that will outlive the bands marketing strategy. Just as fresh as ever, consume immediately.
0061148512|1.0|I found the whole thing to be painfully contrived. Her word use, while precise, is TOO precise, in the sense that I get the distinct feeling she agonized over each one to make the character sound as depressed as possible. What's odd about it is that there doesn't seem to be any real reason for any of it, nor is any particular behavior described that might give me a hint at what goes on in anyone else's mind while interacting with her [Esther Greenwood]. All sincerity seems to have been leeched out of the book which is then peppered with ridiculous assertions that make self-proclaimed feminists sigh with pleasure. Since this is evidently semi-autobiographical I can't imagine what to make of that.<br /><br />Nearly every transition is abrupt and awkward and most of the characters have been flattened out and made into caricatures of feminist archetypes in the most tortured, juvenile manner imaginable. Needless to say that the plot, such as it is, is not helped in the least by any of the \\"people\\" that inhabit it. I could say so much more, but rest assured that it is all scathing.<br /><br />Luckily, it's the only novel she ever wrote, thus sparing me from the agony of someone convincing me to give her another chance. I spent $17 on this book. I consider this another stroke of luck as it is the only feminist work I imagine I'll ever buy, and consider my education complete and cheap at the price!
B00004T9UF|3.0|I like all of eminems stuff. Glad they sell his used cds on here. cd plays just fine. No skipping.
B003ITZBVI|3.0|It's really borderline whether or not to even be able to recommend this movie.  It feels more like a documentary than a story.    More than any other DC comic movie or show, this one consists largely of repetitive dialogue along with lots of running and jumping.  That would be fine if there was a strong story the back it up, but this, as I said, was more like a documentary....a chance to observe Batman as he deals with probably the most emotionally charged period of his life.  For somebody unfamiliar with the comic series that spawned this movie, it was interesting, but that's about it.    Mask Of The Phantasm was a much better Batman movie.  And if you're looking for some good super hero animation with original and entertaining storylines, a much better bet is the Justice League Unlimited series.
B000002KCF|5.0|Absolutely, his best work.  I first had the album, then the cd.  The cd was excellent at first until I upgraded my stereo.  When I bought a new amp and  a pair of huge Boston Acoustic speakers  I was BLOWN AWAY.  Along with Steely Dan's work this recording is outstanding.  A must have for any music lover
B000TTRGUE|5.0|Especially considering the price, this MIC is hard to beat.  Vocals sound very fresh, and you hear what you get.  The wind screen/mesh is highly efficient, as I could not hear the times I breathe in or sing a loud p.  Response is very good, with little need for compression after recording.  That said, if you are looking for something to record an instrument, you will be disappointed.  I recommend this for vocals only!
B000002ADT|5.0|I thought Sketches was his best until I heard Kind of Blue.  The remastered version is a Godsend  An absolute masterpiece.
B000HIVOI2|3.0|Description for this blu ray is lacking in letting you know what special features are available.  Not much included.  Seriously lacking in comparison to DVD release.  If you're just interested in the movie this is a good buy.  If you're looking for all the extras buy the 15th Anniversay Edition.
0670034711|5.0|If you are an introspective person, and appreciate seeing this quality in others then you will enjoy this book. It is surprizingly insightful, yet simply written, tackling some if lifes toughest struggles. This book proves how similar we all really are in the struggles we have in life. Bravo to Elizabeth Gilbert for going on this journey to figure it all out and become the best person she could be. Many people don't have the guts! I admire her! Easy read- kept my attention the entire way through!
B003CIG7AE|4.0|This album while listenable, lacks the edge of the previous albums. This isn't surprising since most of the original band is gone, but perhaps that's the reason behind their name, members just come and go as they please? I think the title track \\"Infinite Arms\\" is the best on the album. I keep going back and forth as to whether this album should get a 3 or 4 four star rating. I feel it's a 3 1/2, but for the sake of their previous works I think I'll round up.
0545123283|3.0|this book compare to second was not so great. It was dragging in alot of areas. where the first book took me two days this book took me two weeks to read.

B0011V7P0A|3.0|Greatest Hits by Tom Petty & Heartbreakers<br />Worth having.  TP and the Heartbreakers' music is standard fare for your library of Rock.  Petty writes good music, if not great, he'll be included in my library and listening.
B003O85W3A|5.0|The Arcade Fire set the bar increddibly high for themselves with their first two albums.  2004's Funeral was beautifully chaotic and difficult to categorize.  Neon Bible, the group's 2007 release was a darker affair that was full of anxiety and turmoil.  Both albums were indie rock masterpieces that positioned the band as a major creative force to be reckoned with.  Their newest release, the hotly anticipated \\"The Suburbs\\" clearly has a lot to live up to.  At first listen, this ablum appears to be the group's most conventional effort to date.  The 16 songs collected here are straight up rock anthems that find the band treading some of the same musical terrain as U2 and Bruce Springsteen and the E-Street Band.<br /><br />Yet it's never quite that simple with The Arcade Fire.  After a couple of spins through \\"The Suburbs\\", some suprising complexities begin to reveal themselves.  Thematically, Win Butler uses the songs on this album to ruminate on the uneasy passage from youth to adulthood and the fears and anxieties that go along with growing up.  The Suburbs is populated by characters who are uneasy with modern life and spend a lot of time looking back at their youth wondering how they ended up where they are.  In the title track, Butler cries out that he wants a daugher while he is still young; but if that's too much to ask for then he would like a son.  Elsewhere he sings that he would rather be alone than pretend that everything is ok.  On on of the album's best tracks, Sprawl II (Mountains Beyond Mountains), Butler hands over the vocal reigns to Regine Chassagne for an electronic flavored lament about trying not to be swallowed up by a modern suburban landscape that is devoid of human connections and emotion.<br /><br />Ultimately \\"The Suburbs\\" seems to be about adults tyring to reconcile their youth with their current lots in life.  Compromises were made, dreams were unrealized and things didn't turn out the way they had planned when they were young and optimistic.  If the songs on this album sound somewhat conventional, perhaps it's by design.  Each song still seems to have a ton of passion and emotion rumbling beneath the surface, as if it could all break free at any moment although the band is working to harness it.  This seems to mirror the fates of the adults on this album who still have plenty of dreams and ambitions left, but feel the need to try and conform and act their age.  The result is a constant tug of war.  Maybe it's best summed up by the songs, \\"The Suburbs\\" and \\"The Suburbs Continued\\" which serve as bookeneds to the record.  In both instances, Butler repeats the refrain, \\"Sometimes I can't believe it/I'm movin' past the feeling\\".  The Arcade Fire's thrid album is about keeping the fire burning, even when it feels like the flame is slowly dying.ic.

B0000C5RQF|5.0|There are already a number of reviews that describe the merits of this recording of Die Zauberflöte.  I can say that I have enjoyed it immensely and would recommend it.  I do want to leave just a few remarks that might help you to decide if it is worth it for you.    Now I know that it isn't always the most useful thing to compare one recording against another, but when it comes to Zauberflöte I find myself referencing Klemperer's inspired 1964 recording (if you only want one recording, that's the one to have).      On the whole Colin Davis' tempi are more fleeting that Klemperer's.  This is tempered at certain points with some very thoughtful and emotional rubato; however, I find that his speeds often short change the emotional depth of the various numbers (Pamina's 'Ach ich fühl's comes to mind).  But it is nothing that isn't common among other British conductors (Mackerras, Marriner, Gardiner).    The stage direction is really first rate.  The costumes and staging do not get in the way of the music.  It is by no means way \\"out there\\" like some other contemporary productions.  It is very conservative, almost minimalist.      The singing is generally very good.  Will Hartman is a very good Tamino; strong voice, though not nearly as lyrical as one has come to expect with the role.  Doroteha Röschmann is a good Pamina, though she doesn't quite deliver that tragic impact the way the Janowitz could.  Simon Keenlyside is the real star.  His acting is every bit the equal of his singing, which is nothing short of outstanding.  Diana Damrau is a better Queen of the Night than most.  She isn't scared of the high F's, though I found her two arias to be too angular (if that makes sense at all).  They seemed to have to many sharp accents, to many bumps and bangs.  I'm not saying that the Queen of the Night is a role for a lyrical soprano, but I thought that she could have smoothed things out a bit.  Franz-Josef Selig gives a pretty good Sarastro, though there are better examples out there.      Among the minor roles there are hits and misses.  The Drie Damen are all exceptional, the Drei Knaben not so much.  The chorus is nothing special; it could have been beefed up a bit for the 2nd Act Finale.  Adrian Thompson gives a fairly interesting Monostatos. The stage director has sought to make the role more politically correct by transforming him from a Moor to a fat, pale-faced, powdered wig wearing character that might be as much at home in Figaro as in Die Zauberflöte.  Even the text of his aria at the beginning of the 2nd Act has been altered.    To sum up, this is a very good recording.  It is the finest that I have seen on DVD to be certain.  I'm not going to call it the best all-around recording, but it is nonetheless very enjoyable and satisfying.

B002TVQ4HG|3.0|Once I got over the fact that this an Australian movie, but I guess because they wanted to involve the Bermuda triangle, some fake American accents from Australian actors where needed. At first it was making me cringe at how phony it was sounding, but once the story started to develop, I was able to get into what was going on, and find a decent story behind it all.     So, Melissa George plays a woman with an autistic son, which seemed to be irrelevant to the plot, till the end... well, the autistic thing IS irrelevant, but having a son isn't... she is invited out for a sail with some dork and his friends, and find themselves in a weird situation where the sea has become calm, and their is pretty much no wind at all... that's when the clouds grow gray, lightning forms and I guess they are now entering the paranormal world of the Bermuda Triangle... which would explain why it needed American accents, as a bunch of Australians filming a movie in Australia and having something too closely related to a Bermuda Triangle incident would just leave viewers saying it would have been better if they just used Bermuda and blah blah blah.    They find themselves boarding a mysterious ship that seems to have no one aboard it, and that's when a groundhog day kind of events begins to occur, and all she wants to do is get off the ship and go pick up her kid from school... by the time the movie is over, you will understand why such and such things do not happen, as one or two reviewers have stated \\"why didn't she just gather every one and her selves in a room together to figure it out\\"... well, the ending obviously went over their heads and they can't work that answer out for themselves.    Overall, it's a decent rental and even better D/L, but not really something that will have much replay value once you've seen it.
B001TI7DG6|4.0|Several interesting themes are explored in Yann Martel's novel, The Life of Pi.  The thread that connects them all is the realization of faith.  Whether people are faced with the uncertainty of fact or fiction, social inclusion or isolation, danger or peace, they must take an existential stand.  The position can be simple relying heavily on a submissive belief in a deity.  Life's large and small inconsistencies then are rationalized as God's will.  The philosophical positions of many people include varying levels of complexity with or without a deity.  For example, science can be the foundation of faith on which people build the temples of their lives.  The complexity is the relative importance in the individual's unifying philosophy of faith and reason.<br /><br />In the novel, Pi's life experiences cause him to travel from a simple to a complex view of the universe at an earlier age than most of us. His adventures illustrate the difficulty of counting on simple explanations of life with the illusion of a stable existence.  The illusion is fostered by a distorted view of time and territory.  Most of our lives we are time incompetent, lingering too long in the past and flying forward to the future. Inevitably something unexpected and unfamiliar enters our area of entitlement.  Then time shrinks to the immediate and so does our zone of comfort.  The ways that we respond to these unpredictable invasions determine the clarity of our faith.  Rather than remaining narrow in our beliefs, at these times we can benefit from being ecumenical in our faith and human in our reactions.<br /><br />Pi shows us many examples of the ways events initiate true integration of faith, reason, and behavior.  The result of his insight into these happenings as a boy allow Pi the man to look at his current life with faithful acceptance of the largely inexplicable and irrational (3.14...) universe.

I'm 66 years old and have been a sugar freak (candy, ice cream, pie, cake, etc) all my life.  I'm 5'9\\" tall and weighted 180 lbs.  My goal is 155 lbs and I am at 170 now.  After the most recent research, there's no reason not giving it a try. Every day gets a little easier.  Good Luck.  Oh, shipping on the book was great and Amazon has always been good.  Good Luck!!!

B0035G5IOE|5.0|In the countryside, there lived a married fox named Mr. Fox (Voiced by George Clooney) with wife Mrs. Fox (Voiced by Meryl Streep) with kids Ash (Jason Schwartzman) and Kirstoferson (Eric Anderson) were living a nice peaceful life. That is until Mr. Fox becomes a chicken-stealer at famed rich farm/grocery store franchise owner Mr Frank Bean (Michael Gambon)'s place causing so much trouble that Bean wants to get even. Some of his friends like Badger (Bill Murray) and others are in danger as well for they must try to survive and find a new place to stay.<br /><br />Based on Roland Dahl's underrated book, this lives up to the title and is THE best animated movie of 2009. Now \\"UP\\" was very good but this is even better as it has more emotion, more unique characters and a better storyline. The film co-stars Owen Wilson and William Dafoe, this movie is a nice break from CGI as being more old fashioned stop motion animation from writer-director-producer Wes Anderson who does his first animated feature. This is a brilliant animated movie mainly for adults but all ages can enjoy it, i wish it could have won best animated movie of the year but oh well, this is a must have for animation buffs.<br /><br />This Blu-Ray offers the motion picture in the purest crystal picture and sound like ever! the extras are terrific from audio commentary, featurettes, still gallery, puppet animation testing and trailer as well as the DVD version of the film with Digital copy version.

1423113381|4.0|I read the Percy Jackson series and I did not hesitate when this book came out (I usually do not buy hardcovers).    The formula of the book to some extent is very similar to the Jackson series, minus the learning disabilities, a character that the parent is missing, a mystical heritage, gods, demons and special friends.  The big difference the heroe is actually two kids, a pair of brother and sister apart since they were kids that by the actions of their father end up learning more about themselves and the need to become a family.    This is the first book in a trilogy and it has a beginning, middle and an end to the story.  We are not left with a cliffhanger but with a resolution against the big bad.    In a manner of speaking a formula very similar to the Harry Potter books.    My four stars is for the way the story is told from the point of view of one of the kids.  Every chapter or every two chapters the story is narrated  by one of the Kane siblings depending on who is taking action.  This at times was frustrating because the character of Sadie Kane does not come at first as your popular nice hero, but an obnoxious, spoiled little girl that does not make you feel sorry for her; making her chapters harder to read and feel sympathy for the so called hero.    Otherwise is a great read and with the price amazon is offering a PLUS.    Get your book and enjoy it for what it is.... A very light adventure to entertain you
B002JCSWV6|5.0|People seldom think of the small victories that give great ones meaning, Invictus talks of what helped the acchievement of our Century the bloodless end of appartheit, the move is as engrossing as a sporting event but takes you through the history of an envolved time painlessly, the principal players are understated, but convey the electricity of the events, a must see!
0061730327|5.0|The many virtues of this book are related in some detail in other reviews here, so I will simply state that this book makes it clear that even small contibutions (the small library in William's area that contained the donated book on windmills) to support furthering education in vastly underserved communities can have a major positive impact.
B002ZG98J6|5.0|Percy Jackson doesn't follow the book very closely but as a movie goes it's still really good.  The effects, the script, all of it are just amazing.  Best of all if you've never read the books, the movie will fill you in on everything from start to finish so you don't spend all your time wondering what's going on.  In other words, you don't need a pre-understanding of the plot from the book in order to enjoy the movie.  I put this one up with the Harry Potter movies.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|All classic rock is not good. Boston has never let me down and this album reminds me why. With a strong vocal set the lead singer keeps you listen to the songs and wanting more. And Boston is one of the few groups that gives me guitar sounds I really enjoy. Some of today's songs are good but there's a reason it's called \\"classic rock\\" and it equals Boston.
B001G9F9IW|5.0|Woody Allen has made some disappointing movies in the autumn of his career but Vicky Cristina Barcelona is not just a return to form, to me it is a really mature work which outshines all his early stuff with the possible exception of Manhattan.     A perfect ensemble piece with note perfect performances from all concerned - Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Penelope Cruz and a particularly charismatic Javier Bardem who is clearly a really fine actor. (Contrast his charming animal magnetism in this movie with the eerily impassive psychopath Anton Chigurh in 'No Country for Old Men.')     The silent star of this movie of course is Barcelona, ravishingly photographed in luminous sunlight. The flamenco guitars on the soundtrack complement the atmosphere perfectly.    The narrative is deftly handled with no pat conclusions and just leaves you feeling the better for having spent some time with real people (albeit, in the case of Bardem and Cruz, people who are clearly very unusual.)    Watching this movie is like sitting in a European cafe on a sunny day watching fascinating events unfold between really interesting people. A small masterpiece.
B003HARV3Y|2.0|I found the film over all poor. I was expecting a better film than I saw. With todays high tech effects and scripts this could have much better. Instead it should have been a direct to DVD movie.  It looks like a good time for all at first but it felt aimed at the under 12 crowd.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|This is worth watching! Action non-stop and a great idea for a plot! The characters are right for the plot and the actors fulfill their roles to the max. I was caught up in the action and the drama. It is so good you have to smile and laugh. I'll let the critics give you more details whether good or bad but if you like blood, guts and glory... you'll like this one!
B000U91OII|5.0|Used this to replace a northbridge fan that had started to emit a maddening high pitched whine when it ran.  It was easy to install, cools well, and is pretty much silent.  A great buy, especially considering the price.

0812973992|5.0|This interconnected collection of desperate New Yorkers in the seventies, revolve around the astounding tight rope walking of Phillippe Petit between the twin towers. This becomes the catalyst or tipping point for an event that happens and the outward ripple effects among these people. I'll admit, at first, I found myself impressed with McCann's writing, but the book hadn't grabbed me yet, and then the second half took hold and I literally finished the book with tears running down my face. Be patient, it pays off in spades. Wonderful book,
B0026JWDQW|5.0|Paolo Nutini is absolutely fantastic. An old soul's ways with a new soul's attitude.  His range of music is interesting because it is so varied with a quality I recognize in old jazz and many other venues, as well as contemporary style. A one off.  I talked to a radio station in Portland, Oregon U.S.A.(Kink fm pdx) and asked them if they had ever heard of this man...they said \\"We just LOVE Paolo!\\"  I have sent two of these cd's to friends and family in the U.S., and they also love him.   I cannot be in a blue mood when listening to this ...what a happy cd it is.  Thank you for promoting his work so we can hear it and enjoy him.  Toni Kitchen  England

B00003CXCD|5.0|I would like a silk nightgown with rosebuds on it.....Sorry you'll have to rough it tonight... As Gregory Peck throws her his pajamas. I grin everytime I watch it.   In the end Peck and Eddie Albert do the right thing even though it costs them fame and a little fortune.  It's hard to find nice people like that these days.  What is the best RomCom ever?  It's \\"While You Were Sleeping\\" with Sandra Bullock.  I think she really won the academy award for that movie and they just gave it to her 15 years too late.
B001NLL8LA|4.0|Love is forever. Especially when you are in love with Jack Reacher. I believe Lee Child is making his JR character grow into a \\"real\\" entity who has been (for the past two books) in a bit of a crisis. He is still clever, fascinating and strong. And he is in a crisis. He will grow out of it. I am sure! Still a great reading that will appeal especially to the Reacher's aficionados.
B003VDZK8K|2.0|While the production value is high and the band is technically sound, this is uninspired corporate metal.  No risks, no creativity, there isn't anything here that I thought was the least bit original.  The album is wildly inconsistent, and not cohesive.  With so many phenomenal metal bands right now, there's no reason to listen to this.
B000VNMMQQ|4.0|Now I'm reviewing Live Free Or Die Hard the last installment of the Die Hard series until they do Die Hard 5. Live Free or Die Hard is just a fun ride with Bruce Wills reprising his McClane role also starring Timothy Olyphant as Thomas Gaberial Justin Long as Matt Ferrell & Mary Elizabeth Winstead as Lucy Genaro McClane. Your plot is the most straight forward of any of the Die Hard movies basically this guy Thomas Gaberial once worked for the Government & was fired for some s**t he shouldn't of done & him & his team are going to shut the entire country down by cyber terrorism. John McClane has to protect this kid Matt Ferrell from these terrorist's also his daughter is kidnapped. I know this wasn't the best explaination of the plot but it's straight forward. My only complaints were PG 13 & Timothy Olyphant was 1 dimensional & looked like he was talking through his teeth a lot. I mean didn't Olyphant watch Alan Rickman or Jermy Irons or even William Sadler. He wasn't terrible but Colonel Stuart had more personality. The action was very good the effects were top notch I'm sure that CGI was used but as long as it's good CGI I have no problem with it. So I like this but not as much as 1-3 becuse of PG 13 rating. I haven't seen the unrated version I would like to. Some weird things was 1 of the original titles was Die Hard Tears Of The Sun Justin Timberlake was in talks to play Jack McClane John's son. In fact the original plot had Jack McClane as the hacker. Brad Renfro auditioned for the Matt role. Ben Afleck was 1 choice to play Jack when McClane's son was involved in the original script. Jessica Simpson auditioned for the role of Lucy McClane. It took 4 months to edit the video package that was used as Thomas Gaberial's warning. This was originally not written as a Die Hard sequel. This was the only Die Hard sequel not mentioning the events of the Nakatomi towers. Ok something that makes me say what? Is oh it's unrealistic. DID YOU SEE ANY OF THE 1ST 3 MOVIES! Causethis is a Die Hard movie not a safe watered down Matt Damon action movie. I just wish we could've had a more charismatic villain. Justin Long was no Reginald Vel Johnson or Samuel L Jackson but I liked him & Lucy in this movie So they gave good performances. . Other than PG 13 I'm  cool with this movie it's a good sequel.

B003JLA4KS|5.0|This is a perfect video for any RUSH fan,it is a definate must see. I was able to see this movie in the theatre, but I enjoyed the dvd even more with all the extra features. The dinner at the moose lodge was great, I couldn't stop laughing it was great.
B00393SFU2|5.0|Criterion brings us another incredible film onto Blu-Ray with Fritz Lang's 'M'.  'M' is Fritz Lang's first film with dialogue, music, and sound.  You will find little in terms of scoring and you will find that you will not miss it.  Lang's images that are strung together to show us the relentless hunt for the child murderer go beyond iconic, as they are a standard for what all others base.        The restoration and print that is given to us by Criterion is nearly flawless, you will find very few if any instances of film imperfection that will pull you from the events on screen.  The original mono track is presented in uncompressed form and it sounds quite amazing. The english speaking version is for you to view as well, but it does not have the restoration that the original language version has.  It should be noted that much of the original footage is used in the english language version and that only some dialogue scenes were reshot in english.  The scene with the Police chief used english speaking actors and the french version in the same way.      The extras are plenty.  Fritz Lang's conversation with The French Connection director William Friedkin is of note in that it is difficult to say where the truth in Lang's words begins and where his imagination ends.  Both intermingle with seemingly no regard to validity from Lang, afterall Lang is a storyteller of sorts.      Whether you are a lover of foreign films, 30s cinema, or entering the realm of classic film for the first time, I believe you will find Fritz Lang's 'M' something of a masterpiece that you will treasure viewing again and again.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|It's been a long while since I've heard an album as cohesive as this; an album that transcends its own medium and becomes something else entirely. This is one of those rare albums that needs to be listened to from beginning to end at least once to truly be appreciated. In much the same way that you lose some of the experience when you enter a movie theatre well after the movie has started playing, jumping into the middle of this is highly unwise. The ArchAndroid, the long-awaited debut work from Janelle Mon&aacute;e, is an album that everyone needs to listen to. It's just that good.<br /><br />It's hard to classify this album under any one genre. Mon&aacute;e expertly and effortlessly blends elements of R&B, Soul, Hip-Hop, Jazz and Pop throughout the album that's as refreshingly original as it is enjoyable to listen to. With these changing genres, Mon&aacute;e's voice changes to suit the genre as well, demonstrating remarkable versatility. Her velvety smooth voice is one that never falters and exhibits no harsh edges (unless she wants to). It's remarkable that she has such unfettered control over her voice, which is something that some pop singers tend to lack at times.<br /><br />The composition of this album is one of the best I've seen in recent memory. In the first third of the album, the songs seem to blend effortlessly into one another, as if they are transforming into something else. The change is surprisingly subtle and initially, you may fail to notice it completely until you're already several seconds into the next song. This became apparent to me immediately as the lively and energetic Dance or Die transitioned into the equally animated and fun Faster. At this point, I looked down at my MP3 player and saw that I had advanced to the next song. As I said before, the transition had been so smooth and elegant that I didn't even know it occurred.<br /><br />After the somewhat surreal transitions of the first few songs, things become slightly easier to comprehend but the album doesn't lose steam in the slightest. If anything, Mon&aacute;e begins to experiment even more, pushing the boundaries of multiple genres as the record continues on. Thankfully, this is an experiment that largely pays off in grandiose fashion. There's an ethereal and otherworldly tone about the tracks backing the vocals, coinciding with the character of the Cindi Mayweather, a character who saw her debut in Mon&aacute;e's 2007 EP Metropolis: Suite I (The Chase). The tale of the ArchAndroid is woven throughout the album and is actually quite interesting.<br /><br />Great examples of Mon&aacute;e's narrative style include the track Locked Inside in which the ArchAndroid herself tells the listener of the citizens' plight, locked inside the Metropolis, a fascist dictatorship that was referenced in her first EP. The story continues with songs such as Sir Greendown, a story of love and longing and Say You'll Go, in which the citizens of the Metropolis (and listeners) are invited on a fantastic voyage to Nirvana, the likes of which they have never experienced.<br /><br />What makes this album great isn't just Mon&aacute;e's smooth and incredibly versatile voice, the excellent production or the singular and well thought out narrative that flows through every track on the album. No, what makes this album so great is the combination of all of these things. The result is an amazingly cohesive debut album that excels both in concept and execution. This is definitely one of the best albums I've heard this year and comes highly recommended. This truly is an experience unlike any other you're likely to experience this year.slightest.

0812973992|5.0|I loved this book and was sad when it was over.  It is cleverly composed and the story line weaves in and out of chapters that at first seem disconnected.  I highly recommend it for anyone who is not interested in fluff.  This book grabs your heart and makes you think.
B003KUSUG8|3.0|After Eminem's return to rap in the form of last year's Relapse, many fans were left wanting more. While Relapse  was a passable effort from the venerable Detroit emcee, it wasn't the triumphant return to form that fans were expecting from him after 2004's disappointing Encore. When Relapse was released, Eminem revealed that he had also completed another album, tentatively entitled Relapse 2, which was set to be released at the end of 2009.<br /><br />Recovery was born after Relapse 2 was pushed into 2010 and Eminem apparently went back to the drawing board to retool the album before release, to ensure that it would be the comeback album that he needed and his fans were thirsting for. With that said, does this album have what it takes to impress fans and critics alike? Read on to find out.<br /><br />Eminem constantly and vehemently asserts that this is his official comeback album and that he is back in top form once again, starting early on the album with Talkin' to Myself, a profoundly honest confessional track. On this track, he demonstrates impressive depth and complexity as he tells the tale of his downward spiral into addiction and his eventual climb out of it.<br /><br />While there are many tracks on which Eminem sounds genuinely apologetic (dare I say...endearing?) for letting his fans down, there are many where he seems to be back to his old shtick. On Going Through Changes, he's rapping about how he's maturing and his struggles with his recent drug addiction, the death of his best friend (the late rapper and D12 alum Proof) and rehabilitation and on the next, he's rapping about a \\"white trash party\\" on W.T.P. This brings to light another problem with the album and that is its inconsistency. Recovery doesn't have a singular focus and there's no sense of cohesiveness when going from Talkin' To Myself to W.T.P. and it results in an unfocused and somewhat jarring listen.<br /><br />As much as I've criticized this album, there's a lot that Eminem has done right here. Eminem's signature blistering lyricism is on display in great form here, demonstrated very well on the angst-ridden 25 to Life and proves that he can sling metaphors with the best of them on the punchline-heavy Won't Back Down. Heck, on the Haddaway sampling No Love, I was even satisfied with a verse by Lil' Wayne. That alone is something special.<br /><br />I may sound like I'm being a bit harsh on Eminem but, given the quality of his pre-Encore efforts, I've grown expect more of him. Allow me to reiterate. I don't think this album is bad by any means. If anything, Eminem is just a victim of his own success. Most other rappers could probably release this album and have it met with high praise. Eminem, on the other hand, has raised his personal bar so high for so many that missing that bar results in serious disappointment.<br /><br />Recovery is an enjoyable, if unfocused addition to Eminem's catalog. Perhaps it's not as good as I was hoping it would be but as a whole, this is a good album. This is an album I can safely say that will be in my regular rotation for longer than Relapse and Encore were before it and that, in and of itself is a comforting thought. Eminem is on the right path, he just needs to reevaluate what he wants to accomplish with his rhymes. In some ways, it seems that he can't let go of the Slim Shady persona that was so dominant on the Slim Shady LP and Marshal Mathers LP and evolve his lyrical style beyond the madcap craziness of his previous albums and that is what seems to be holding him back here.<br /><br />Most of the tracks on Recovery prove that Eminem still has the lyrical chops to elevate himself above the majority of today's mainstream Hip-Hop genre. Here's hoping he reacquires his focus for his next album and delivers the cohesive world-beater that he's capable of.ering lyricism is on display in great form here, demonstrated very well on the angst-ridden 25 to Life and proves that he can sling metaphors with the best of them on the punchline-heavy Won't Back Down.

B0039208QM|4.0|Before Nolan's Batman films came out, this was my favorite Batman movie.  Like The Dark Knight, Batman Returns is very villain-centered.  The rogues gallery were always my favorite part of the comics as well as the film franchise.  In this installment we get two villains who at the time seemed like the last bad guys you'd pick.  The Penguin and Catwoman?  Tim Burton had a feeling and he went for it.  He put a unique twist on these two forever that would reshape the world of Batman.  His twisted dark Penguin is an amazing combination of scary, funny, and badass.  Catwoman is another sinister baddie that dances between sexy and psychotic.  These two characters are the movie for me.<br /><br />That leads me to say, that the rest of the film isn't much without them.  The plot feels underdeveloped, and characters just cross paths like it's destiny.  I'm letting you know right now that you won't be liking this movie because of it's storyline.  I don't know if anyone liked the idea of a bunch of penguins with rockets tied to their backs.  I watch this film and enjoy it for the witty banter between the characters and the character design inside and out.<br /><br />Watching this film on Blu-ray was such an experience.  They did an amazing job at converting the picture on this disc.  It looks incredible and I wouldn't watch Batman any other way.  This may be nearly a two-decade old film, but it looks good enough to be recent.  Don't hesitate to get you old favorites on Blu, because they'll make you throw out those dvds.
B000WMEAKC|5.0|I purchased this album three years ago mainly because of the song \\"Apologize\\", and boy was I happy I bought the rest of the tracks as well. The album is great, and I still listen to it today. The same can't be said for other \\"mainstream\\" music that has come up between 2007 and now.
0307454541|1.0|I committed to reading this book, hoping it would improve, but it was a torture I couldn't wait to be over. It was dry and lifeless. Another viewers comment about the Swedish aspect being too distracting and overwhelming was right on target. I had just finished two books about Germany and ended up feeling educated, pulled in by the seamless way the new-to-me culture was woven into the story. Tattoo was way too talky -- the main characters explained their findings like we were following them on a documentary, as opposed to an involving story. I just didn't like this book at all.
B003LAH7MU|5.0|If there's anything more pathetic than a rocker who has advanced into middle or old age and still tries to harken back to their \\"rock on\\" days I don't know what it is.  Sting is moving on to new fields and Symphonicities is proof of that.  I think this CD is a progression of his earlier work.  A reworking of music into a new form.  It appears that some of his fans don't get that.<br /><br />Artists, like the rest of us, must evolve.  Sting either isn't capable or isn't interested in doing what he did when he was in the Police.  I congratulate him on that.  I enjoyed the Police, but I have always thought his most creative work came after those early days, but that's another debate.<br /><br />Symphonicities is a re-examination of his work through a different lens.  Not everyone will like it (just read some of the reviews here) and that's ok.  The rest of us are enjoying the journey that Sting has undertaken.  I'm not sure what is coming from Sting in the future, but whatever it is, it will be different than the late 70's and the 80's.  Please spare us the aging rocker who doesn't recognize that the ship has sailed.<br /><br />This CD doesn't omit the best works of his career.  The songs are all here.  I won't rehash what other reviewers say about the character if the individual offering.  Suffice it to say I bought the CD and am enjoying is a lot.<br /><br />If you enjoy Sting then I think you'll enjoy Symphonicities.<br /><br />Peace always.
0743298039|5.0|Loved this book. Got it for my book club meeting and even though it didn't sound interesting at all, it turned out to be very intriquing. A great story with some fun revelations at the end.
0545123283|5.0|Linger picked up right where Shiver left off. The detail was exactly what i expected. This was a beautifully written story with vibrant characters and an abundance of emotion with the right amounnt of drama[[ASIN:0545123283 Linger (Wolves of Mercy Falls, Book 2)]]. The end makes it seems as there may be a 3rd book to follow. I hope very much that there is and look forward to reading it.

0783226063|5.0|TO SAY I LOVE ' DUNE ' WOULD BE AN UNDERSTATEMENT.  Quite simply, the \\" Dune \\" series of books has captured my heart, mind and soul like no other series of books I have ever read in my life.  Eune blends together science fiction, future history, religion, politics, psychology, family struggles, and personal human development and drama like no other series in history.  It has been said before but I'll say it again, DUNE IS THE GREATEST SERIES IN SCIENCE FICTION HISTORY.  I was 7 YEARS OLD when this movie came out, a smart little immigrant kid from Nicaragua who wasn't White, was learning to speak English and loved music.  I had a boy crush on Sting back then because I loved his music and thought he was a great musician ( and still is ).  So when I saw this movie for the first... I honestly can't remember the first time I saw because I HAVE LITERALLY SEEN IT OVER 100 TIMES, WHEN I SAY I HAVE SEEN IT OVER 100 TIMES I HAVE SEEN EVERY VERSION OF THIS MOVIE THAT EXISTS OVER 100 TIMES.  I don't watch it for the fine piece of movie-making that it is, because it DEFINITELY IS NOT A GREAT FILM AND DEFINITELY THE LOW POINT OF DAVID LYNCH'S CAREER, even though Mr. Lynch is a certifiable genius and for the life of me I cannot fathom why he couldn't make this work, but everybody I speak to who knows \\" Dune \\" and knows david Lynch always agree:  To bring a masterpiece like \\" Dune \\" to the silver screen, a special kind of director was needed, and that director could have only been DAVID LYNCH.<br />  Quuite honestly, the things I hate the most about this movie deal with the pace and constant repetitiveness that takes place throughout this movie.  While the book itself flowed like a well-played song played on Gurney Halleck's basilet, the movie was plodding and slow, at times shoddily shot, dark and full of ceaseless babble, pyscho-drivel and messianic visions of a future that some '60's hippie from San Francisco on LSD could have only come up with.  Paul Atreides ( played by Kyle Maclachlan ) was always having strange visions about his future, and although these visions were central to the movie because Paul was \\" The Kwisatz Haderach \\", the Universe's Super-Being the audience doesn't know that, and NOBODY who has never read the books will even know the F is going on, they'll probably turn it off within the first 15 minutes.  It's not everybody's type of movie, it's not a movie you take a date to, it's not a movie where you stand up and cheer, or laugh, or cry, quite simply you sit there and take it all in.  It's a story plain and simple, a narrative account of how a priveledged young man who seems to just be a normal person has a special destiny in him that he neither chose nor wanted but ultimately has to accept ( like Jesus of Nazareth, and the allusions and similarities to Jesus Christ couldn't be more obvious ).  The names in the movie are alternative spellings of various Islamic, Hebrew and Christan names, and in the other Dune books, particularly the \\" Butlerian Jihad \\" series of books the Islamic references are very apparent, like the progenitor of the Fremen, whose name was ISMAEL.  Many times I have seen this movie only for the BREAT SOUNDTRACK BY THE 80'S BAND TOTO, OF \\" Africa \\" and \\" Rosanna \\" fame, and more than once I have sat through the movie to hear the final, memorable, haunting piece of music at the end, the masterpiece of instrumental music known as \\" Take My Hand \\".<br />  THIS MOVIE IS FROEZN IN TIME FOR ME.  THIS IS A PIECE OF MY CHILDHOOD THAT I WILL ALWAYS CARRY WITH ME THROUGH MY LIFE AND HAS BEEN LIKE A VERY DEAR FRIEND TO ME.  EVEN TO THIS DAY I COME TO AMAZON OR TO THE LIBRARY TO PICK UP THE NEWEST ' DUNE ' BOOKS BY BRIAN HERBERT AND KEVIN J. ANDERSON, AND ALTHOUGH I'M ANGRY THAT BRIAN HERBERT WANTS TO MILK ' DUNE ' FOR ALL IT'S WORTH HE HAS SOME GOOD IDEAS AND MANAGES TO FLESH IT OUT MORE AND MORE.  Sadly, like everything in life \\" Dune \\" can't live forever, and one day the series will finally end but I STILL REMEMBER EVERYTHING ABOUT IT, FROM ' DUNE \\" to Messiah, Children, God Emperor, Heretics, Chapterhouse, House Atreides, House Harkonnen, House Corrino, Bulerian Jihad, Machine Crusade, Battle of Corrin... YES, I HAVE READ ALL THOSE BOOKS, OVER 100,000 PAGES OF DUNE!!!  I haven't read \\" Hunters \\" or \\" Sandworms \\" but I know what they're about, and the new ones are just the last drops of milk from Mr. Herbert's cash cow, but I'll always be a fan and I will always love \\" DUNE \\".

B003S897UK|5.0|The mix is good.  The show is hot.  This is classic Mule from the trio era.  Made me really miss the old Woody days.  The stuff with Little Milton is great.  Just hot rockin' old school blues.  Wish these guys would release some of the jams they did with Larry McCray back on the '98 tour!  The stuff with Audley Freed shows that the Mule works as a two guitar combo.  It's fun to hear these guys play stuff they like.  A great show.  Miss the old Mule.  Release more of this stuff, guys!
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|I became a fan of Doctor Who just recently (I know, I know) and needed to catch up on some of the backstory. This collection was the perfect purchase. First it gives me a chance to see David Tennant's take on the doctor and gives you most of what you need to know leading up to the big finale and the change to Matt Smith's 11th doctor. The stories are very good. As I've explored more in the past of the doctor, it is clear the show is at its best when it focuses on character and that is the strength of two of these episodes in particular: \\"The Next Doctor\\" and \\"Waters of Mars\\" are very well done. Plus there is the continuing theme through these episodes of the 10th doctor's pain at the loss of his various companions. I have one pet peeve with the way the BBC ends episodes of Doctor Who and this is particularly apparent on the \\"Waters of Mars\\" episode. The BBC doesn't give you even a second to linger over the touching ending of this episode before the jarring previews of coming attactions pop up on the screen. That happened in the current season as well. Knock it off BBC. I'm watching a DVD, it is not like I'll change channels if you gave me two seconds of silence at the end of a dramatic story before some announcer shouts \\"On the next Doctor Who.....\\"<br /><br />The extras that come with the specials are good. The Doctor Who Confidential series is helpful if you are a newcomer to the doctor and probably still has value for life long fans. I particularly enjoyed the Doctor Who Proms. I've always enjoyed the Proms whenever we've gotten to see them here in the US, and a Doctor Who Prom was a special treat.

B0029LX2LC|5.0|I am not a Rap/R&B fan but I do appreciate good music. This album is great!! It has been hard trying not to wear it out. Everything fits perfectly from the introspective lyrics to the beats to the overall continuity from one track to the next. It is confident and strong with intelligent lyrics.    I don't connect with Rap/R&B as I do with rock and other types of music but there is something powerful and further reaching coming from How I Got Over. Check it out!
B003O86MY8|5.0|Before this album, I had never heard of David Garrett.  I just saw an album cover with a cool-looking dude on the violin and thought \\"Awww, heck, let's live dangerously.\\"  So I bought it.  I was absolutely floored!  Shortly after I listened to this album I did a little research and found out that he's been around quite a while.  I am now embarrassed that I had not discovered him sooner.  But better late than never, right?  This is a classic example that the only limitations you have on your music are the ones you impose upon yourself.  I'd recommend this album to anybody.
B0001XAPZ6|3.0|Being a great admirer of the director's work I was greatly looking forward to viewing this early \\"epic masterpiece\\".   Unfortunately - perhaps because it is apparently a condensed reworking of a TV series - I found it incoherent and extremely difficult to follow.  Who was attacking who and why became extremely tedious.  Powerful ecological concerns were evident and admirable, as were, as always in Miyazaki's work, great visual imaginative details and images.  But it seemed endless and confusing despite my positive predisposition to want to like it.  What is perhaps most interesting is the degree to which this film is obviously the source of inspiration for many of the ideas in James Cameron's even more disappointing Avatar.  So many details were reworked in the latter that Cameron should have be embarrassed to have not credited Miyazaki's concepts.
B002ZG997C|1.0|Low budget post apocalyptic yawn. Very disappointed considering the caliber of the main protagonist, Washington, I suppose even he is forced to take on a few \\"B\\" movies by contract. The gratuitous violence was expected but it wasn't done very well, with much interest or special effects. Why do they keep making movies in sepia color, I bought a 52\\" 1080p and I get sepia color, I hate it. As far as the plot, it was totally unbelievable (not in a good way) followed by a ridiculous and disappointing ending; the one thing that the world really needed to get rid of \\"religious dogma\\"<br />Here was their one and only chance and they blew it!  Go figure.
B002VECLVY|4.0|This was an amazing entry for Tom Ford as a director.  The movie was very well made and had many artistic qualities that reinforced the story line.
0895260131|3.0|The first sections starts out with author presenting verses from the Koran and picking up the narrative from what some prominent Muslim leaders have said in the past and how this relates to each other which appear loose and some times even out of context. He goes on to give an analysis on what he thinks is right or in this case why politically in correct the general analysis on Islam had always been by always doing a comparison with Christianity rather an do a generic analysis based common religions. The huge historical references in the book don't do much justice to this analysis either which were presented in unreadable way. How ever the book tends to get interesting from Crusades section on and presents a more believable picture of why Crusades were necessary and what would have happened if they never took place. By far the best part of the book is its explanation of Islamic Jihad in the last section about what Jihad groups really and want is Islamophobia? Why the west is not as critique of the religion as it should have been. Again it picks up rhetoric in the conclusion part based on Christianity. At the end I believe the author intended to present an analysis of Islam and not to portray the already standing image of Christianity vs. Islam in this book but it certainly end up in sections based on authors biased out look. All though this book tries to present the other side of Islam, the huge comparison with Christianity, cherry picked verses and out of contexts do no justice to this. While this book can be read for some interesting sections and facts it should only serve as a starting point and would require further reading.
B000002KCI|5.0|Zuma is only mildly interesting, but sometimes when I'm in the right mood the majority of the material on this album hits the spot, so that means the album rating I give is a 4 out of 5.  Sometimes that rating will drop to a 3 though.  Depends on my mood and my ability to put up with easy-going country rockers.  However sometimes the rating will go up to a 5.  It really does depend on mood.<br /><br />\\"Don't Cry No Tears\\" is a decent country rocker.  The tempo moves along at *just* the right pace so I hardly ever get bored with it.  Say what you will about Neil Young, but he was (and perhaps still is) quite good at making legitimate country songs despite arguably being more talented in the singer/songwriter folk rock department, or when writing lengthy guitar jams with Crazy Horse.<br /><br />\\"Danger Bird\\" is REALLY strange.  Neil's vocal range goes all haywire like he was completely stoned when he laid this song down on tape.  Either that or he's deliberately mocking the country rock style by expanding his vocal range and making the entire thing highly unusual, who knows.  I LOVE it though.  I'm glad he sings it that way!  It makes the vocal melody sound anthemic.<br /><br />\\"Pardon My Heart\\" is a bit too quiet and reminiscent of other soft rockers like America or the Orleans for my taste, but it's alright I suppose.  If someone were to compare it to Crosby, Stills and Nash, that would present another problem- most of the time CSN absolutely destroyed a song like this.<br /><br />\\"Lookin' for a Love\\" is a pretty song.  I could have sworn I've heard that exact same verse melody from a Christmas song, but I can't remember if it's a traditional style Christmas song or something a rock band created that I'm thinking of.  It sounds familiar though.  *Extremely* familiar.<br /><br />\\"Barstool Blues\\" sounds like complete filler with obnoxiously high pitched vocals to boot.  I don't like this song too much.  A song like this makes a complete mockery out of the country rockstars of the mid 70's.  Update- May 16, 2012- alright so the vocals don't sound like a mockery to me anymore and the melody itself IS pretty awesome after all.  I didn't get this song two years ago.  The intro from \\"Stupid Girl\\" sounds like it was stolen from George Harrison's \\"Beware of Darkness\\".  I like this song quite a bit anyway, especially the vocals.<br /><br />\\"Drive Back\\" is a forgettable rocker, but it *sounds* decent at least (yeah, like that's really a stretch- ALL Neil Young material sounds decent!).  Update- May 16, 2012.  Just like \\"Barstool Blues\\", I didn't get the crunchy, borderline pre-grunge style that the guitar playing closely resembles two years ago.  I was wrong and I admit it.<br /><br />\\"Cortez the Killer\\" features a lengthy guitar jam, but it's not nearly as memorable as the jams that occurred from previous albums, such as... you guessed it, Everybody Knows This is Nowhere.  In fact, the guitar playing here doesn't do a darn thing to perk my interest one bit despite giving it over 20 chances to click.  Update May 16, 2012- well after numerous listens (and several years) suddenly now the guitar playing DOES sound interesting to me.  I can't explain why I was unable to grasp the greatness of the guitar work all these years.  In fact the guitar solo seems to loop in a hypnotic and repetitive way so it's probably not a guitar jam in the traditional sense.  Decent vocals too.  Alright I give in, this song's a classic.<br /><br />\\"Through My Sails\\" ends this decent enough album on a note that probably reminds you of the pretty and peaceful vibes of the soft rock period in the mid 70's.<br /><br />Overall, Zuma gets a decent rating.  Not in the top, oh I don't know, 2,000 albums released in the 70's, but it's decent enough.  Yes, decent is the perfect word to describe this.  Not fantatic, not brilliant, not terrible either.  Just decent.  Update May 16, 2012.  Alright so the album IS deserving of all the praise and standing strong as a 5-star album overall.  Time really helped me warm up to this one.
B000JMLFLW|2.0|It goes without saying Pride and Prejudice is a classic of all time. My concern here and the reason for the low rating is the poor quality of this Kindle version. There are typos and in several places in the text very, very simple errors are made: in a few places, the same word repeats itself along the lines of \\"the the chair,\\" a couple malapropisms I am positive were not in the original text, and other typesetter's error that, if this Kindle edition had been subject to even a cursory review by a proofreader, would have been caught. I too would like to mention the FACT that emphasized WORDS are all CAPITALIZED in this version as AMAZINGLY annoying. I have never seen an actual book loaded with so many simple errors as this ebook is.
0061537969|2.0|Sorry, I am a dog lover but this book was lost on me.  First, I never would have read it if it was not a book chosen for our book club.  Second, it was strange coming from a dogs perspective.  Third, it was just plain stupid.  Would not recommend it.
B000PDYVVG|5.0|As other reviewers note, this isn't the spiritual memoir to go to when one's seeking true depth and profundity - but it was also never intended to be that.     This is a beach read.     There are a lot of scathing reviews from people who loathe the author's self-centered shallowness, but they all seem to be missing an important point: Yes, she behaved in a way she clearly and strongly admits time and again is extremely selfish. It's incredibly -embarrassing- to admit you have behaved so badly to a private friend, much less in a book published for all the world to see. It takes quite a bit of guts, in fact, guts and strength to do so.     And this is the theme throughout the book and her adventures in various parts of the world. Yes, she's shallow and selfish, but she -owns- these qualities and faces them squarely and that, my friends, is done far, far too rarely by anyone these days. Her very weaknesses are what make this book so interesting to read.    So what is this book? It's a good beach read with a main character who has more than her share of shortcomings, money, self-honesty, and writing ability. They make an interesting mix and an entertaining beach read, not a spiritual classic. Judging the book as the beach read it is (and not as the spiritual classic people seem to think it should have been) it's worth five stars.
B000AMJC2K|5.0|Most monitor arms try to provide some sort of adjustment mechanism based on tension screws or balancing hydraulics.  They never work -- they sag over time and aren't stable.    This product uses a far less expensive solution: a simple locking joint.  But the result is far superior!  Although it takes a tiny bit more time to adjust the arm, you'll find that you very rarely do that.  The reward is a more stable monitor position and greater strength.    Oh, and by the way, you can install it upside-down which is a huge plus (that's the reason I bought it).

0061122416|3.0|I'd heard a lot of great things about this book, but was very disappointed when I finally sat down to read it. The overuse of terms such as, \\"Master Work\\" and \\"Personal Legend\\" and \\"Language of the Universe\\", made it seem more like a thinly veiled self help book than a fable or literary masterpiece.  Moreover I felt it was just too oversimplistic (things just seemed to HAPPEN to him, beyond just beginner's luck, and falling in love with a girl he hadn't even spoken to, and she automatically fell back in love with him?) and repetitive. As another reviewer noted, it was also a tad judgmental, for example, Santiago often judged people who weren't on a journey; who is to say that some people's journeys are to get married and have a family? And finally, I didn't agree with how male-dominated the book was, as the only women in the story were Santiago's mother and loves; women had no substantial place in this book.
0385523904|5.0|After Fareed Zakaria's urging, I picked this book up from my public library.  I was impressed with the incredible research done by the author.  All the interviews are in depth and cover the North Korean subject from childhood to their eventual escape to China and South Korea.  Not a dull read in any sense, Nothing to Envy keeps the reader on their toes by making North Korea seem freakishly unbelievable.  After reading it, I reread 1984 and was struck by the similarities.  The spies who are willing to turn there neighbors are freakishly similar to Orwell's Thought Police.  The constant romanticizing of Pyongyang's regime through propaganda classes and movies is straight out of the 1984.

081297381X|4.0|As a counterpoint to many who disliked this book, I really enjoyed this book BECAUSE of the over-the-top egotistical presentation, the liberal use of high-falutin' words, and actually naming names of his foes in economics and finance.  I am disappointed with the ending because he does not provide much of an alternative to the thoroughly bashed Gaussian models. His main advice is: if you are in a positive black swan world, actively take on risk, but if you are in a negative black swan world, be hyper-cautious.<br /><br />I think the reason for this lack of a workable approach for living with black swans (both positive and negative) is that our collective understanding of the field is so undeveloped.  So I see this book as a CALL TO ARMS to the profession by goading them into an angry riot.  Maybe if enough of them rolled up their sleeves and said, \\"I'll show that ---- Taleb, what he can do with his high-falutin' arse!\\" then we will have a robust development in non-Gaussian models.<br /><br />There are already small groups working on non-Gaussian models (e.g., computer simulations using inheritance rules, stress tests using data from previous market crashes and imagined potential crashes, and substituting power-law distribution in place of the Gaussian). This group could really benefit from the media spotlight derived from Taleb's book! Several researchers say that \\"independence\\" and \\"stationarity\\" assumptions are harder to get around than the \\"Gaussian\\" assumption. I have high hopes for these groups and wish them the best of luck.  :-)
B0039UTDA6|1.0|Despite the fact that Oprah is a horrendous narrator - I absolutely agree with the other reviewers on this point - the series itself did not live up to expectations.  They repeated several sequences in more than one episode!  With all the \\"Life\\" that there is in the world, it seems completely absurd that they show the same animals performing the same behaviors in different episodes.  Additionally, some of the shots are computer generated.  Again, we're supposed to be seeing Life here, not a representation of it.  It definitely did not live up to the extremely high bar that Planet Earth set, and I would recommend waiting until this is really cheap to buy on DVD - and definitely the David Attenborough version!
1597801585|4.0|Everybody's got a name for it, but I'm going to label Bacigalupi's grim post-oil world of pain 'springpunk,' because of the grubbily archaic technology involving, interestingly, tension and release that pervades it. Everything in Krung Thep (future Bangkok) is falling apart at the seams, and at no point does this frightening sense of impending doom let up; in fact, it escalates to a tumultuous series of explosive events which may or may not be the release the story is questing toward. As a huge fan of the author's YA book 'Ship Breaker,' I found 'The Windup Girl' similar in style, just much more adult in theme and content. The pivotal character of Emiko, a bioengineered creature shunned by society - such as it is - is truly heartbreaking; I wish, in fact, that we'd had more of her, as her struggles really seemed to capture the tone of the story as a whole (if there's a sequel, I'm sure we will). Brutal and satisfying!
1439153663|2.0|The reviews I read prior to picking this up were great and, as a fan of historical fiction, I thought I was getting ready to read a real winner.  I usually enjoy stories of the south and enjoy southern writers of all types so I was eager to get started.<br /><br />Set on a tobacco plantation right after the Revolutionary War, the main character is a young Irish girl (age 7) who's parents died on the Atlantic crossing.  She becomes the slave/servant of the plantation owner and lives among the slaves but has one of the higher positions in the kitchen house.  The slave stories and the stories of the plantation family are interwoven throughout the novel and much about life during that time period is explored.<br /><br />I know I am going against the popular opinion on this one, but I didn't like it at all.  I often read books that are less than cheerful such as novels about the Holocaust, so I don't have a dislike of \\"downer\\" books, but this one was just too much.  Every page is filled with one tragedy after the next.  Rape, incest, beatings, mental illness, physical and mental abuse fill page after page after page.  I know life as a slave had to be horrible and want to be clear that my expectation was not happy, grateful slaves, but the constant tragedies in the family of the master went on and on as well.  If something awful could happen in this family, it did.  I found myself hating to pick the book up and actually felt out-of-sorts emotionally when not reading - the negativity just bled over into my everyday life.  The novel felt like a soap opera jam packed with disaster after disaster.<br /><br />I also had some difficulty with the writing and there were believability issues so those aspects didn't save the novel for me either.<br /><br />I wanted to like it; hoped to like it; and tried to like it (I really did).  This one wasn't my cup of tea.

1439165645|5.0|My husband gave me a copy of The Hundred-Foot Journey for our first (paper) wedding anniversary, and from the moment I opened it, I was captivated.  In my many (many!) years of reading about food and cooking, I have never been so entranced - I smelled every marvelous aroma, tasted every delicious mouthful, and heard every exclamation in every accent.  I was transported around the world with the Haji family - from India, to London, to the French Jura, to Paris and the South of France - and I shared in their celebrations as well as their tears.  This is a book to be savored, embraced, and cherished.  Pick up this book and read the blurbs on the back cover - for once, they are not overblown raves, they are dead on.  If you love food, do not miss this wonderful book!
0316066524|5.0|In the opening two words of William Shakespeare's Hamlet (from which Infinite Jest derives its title), Bernardo cries \\"Who's there?\\" having seen the ghost of a tragedy; and in the first two words of this epic novel, David Foster Wallace answers - \\"I am . . .\\"         But that's about as attention-grabbing as one can be, here.  Infinite Jest is a book that's nearly impossible to review concisely.  On one hand it can be critiqued all vague and ornate to try and convey a slap-across-the-face of its brilliance, but therein's the risk of sounding like a disingenuous lit-rag.  On the other hand, one could be more expositional, touching on the (subsidiary) plot line and some of the Info Age/hell of addiction themes explored so intricately throughout.  Problem is, to merely touch on these things would be to wind belly-up inadequate read by anyone who hasn't already experienced the book and thus doesn't yet have a sense of what Wallace is up to in this masterpiece, and the sheer accomplishment he managed in translating it to language.         Though at least I think we can say this in praise: everyone should dedicate, at some point, an hour or so a night for a couple months of his/her life to Infinite Jest.  Its ability to whiplash from l-o-l funny to outright emotional is unparalleled in anything I've read outside of Pynchon.  He delves into some of the most abstruse philosophical concepts one would hope to know - sociopolitical applied mathematics, doctoral explorations of addiction and depression, to name a few - but does so via poetic metaphor and tongue-in-cheek allegory that never strays into fictively contrived (junior tennis students playing a \\"bomb game\\" on the court to analogously explore nuclear proliferation - the players as a mathematical diagram; just one example . . .).  What we end up with is a dense and sprawling work, juggling tragic/comedic/philosophic/and practically every other form there is, and at the same time it can be capital-E Entertaining with theright mind looking into it.         Reading Infinite Jest gives one the sense that, not just was Wallace a genius, but one of those seemingly rare geniuses whose hearts somehow outweigh their minds.  I.e. the author is not merely showing off to us what he knows, what he can do; it's more like he's . . . reaching out.  And when you're aware of Wallace's tragic real-life mental struggle - the epitome if there ever was one of the \\"tortured artist\\" - you start to hear his voice between every line of the 1,000+ pages; and so then you want to understand, you want to reach back . . .  Sadly though, it's too late.    Rest In Peace, DFW - you accomplished more with this one book than most writers ever even imagine.      --Jake Wilson - author of [[ASIN:145638144X Chasing Rabbits]]
B003ITZBVI|5.0|I've watched other DC direct to video movies and lets face it.  Some where ok, and others where garbage, but I bought this on Blu Ray and I loved this movie.  No questions about it, I was on the edge of my couch throughout the entire movie.
B001O2MBP0|4.0|Simply hilarious and the acting completely trumps that of the version recently released in the U.S.  I don't know why they even bothered.
1423113381|5.0|This book continues the gripping style that Riordan writes in.  If you liked the Olympians series, you will love the Kane Chronicles.  Can't Wait for the next one!
B003HKN51Q|5.0|Could have been much better.     I own this film on all formats, VHS, Laser-Disc, VCD and bootleg DVD. I've waited long for a proper high-quality release of this great concert film.     The quality of the video is great compared to all previous releases. The transfer is sharp, hi-def and has great colors. It is a bit grainy and the print used for mastering does have some wear but overall appearance is fresh and new.     The audio quality is a big disappointment. DTS-HD? Common! Sure, you can take anything and convert it into DTS-HD but it wont make it high-quality. The audio quality is only slightly better than the Laser-Disc release. They didn't bother to go into RCA recordings and remaster, they simply used the original soundtrack and had some remastering done and a very basic mix into 5.1. Unfortunately no other audio option is offered other than the 5.1 DTS-HD, a 2 channel PCM would have been nice! The mix to 5.1 is very basic and offer Elvis only in the center channel (in singing too) along with the drums and rest of the instruments come from right and left. The result is a bit weird and I've enjoyed listening much more when setting my receiver to a stereo mode, then the sound came back to life and I got some good experience. Also, for some reason the gain is quite low, about 6db-10db less loud than most musical releases on Blu-Ray.     The movie is untouched. No editing, no extras footage, no nothing. The Blu-Ray also doesn't offer any additional material. No bonuses what so ever, not even the trailer.     One way the film was changed - a major disappointment - at the begining after Elvis' onologue (my daddy always said.......) instead of bursting into the great version of Johnny Be Good, you get a live version of \\"don't be cruel\\", most likely a \\"rights\\" issue.     The packaging is amazing, including a great color booklet.     For those of you who don't know the film and just want to know whether to get it or not - Get it! You get a raw footage of Elvis in theearly 70's, lean and mean while touring around the US in large stadiums which gave the concerts a more raw and rockish feeling than his Vegas shows. You also get a glimpse behind stage of Elvis and his entourage.
B0039TD7PY|5.0|Carole King and James Taylor have been favorites of mine for a long time.  I've seen both of them in concert.  How perfect that they got together for this tour. The camera angles on the DVD put the viewer right in the middle of the concert. And I can enjoy the CD while driving to work.
0061906220|5.0|Read this book just once to a pre-schooler and see what happens.  My two-year old grandson began bouncing on my lap to the rhythm of the text only halfway through our first reading. He demanded a second reading, \\"Again! Again!\\"  During the second reading, he chanted right along with me in his own language. By the third reading his mother had her camera out.  Without any prompting from us, he grabbed the book, slid from my lap, and pranced on the floor holding the open book in front of him while the whole family chanted together, \\"I love my white shoes. . . \\"    We love our yellow book---we love that blue cat . . . for its instant appeal---for its understated message---for its effective teaching of the colors---for its simplicity---for its economic language---for the way it drew three generations into its charm. Not many books are all that. I, for one, can't think of ANY others that are.   As a retired first grade teacher who usually agrees with the SLJ reviews, I can't imagine what got into the person who reviewed Pete the Cat for SLJ.
B001ED7C58|5.0|One of my favorite soundtracks of all time!  Way better than the \\"New Moon\\" and \\"Eclipse\\" soundtracks.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|Not a John Mayer fan at all. To me, most his songs are depressing and all sound the same. I turn the radio whenever he comes on. I had a friend give me a copy of this cd and right from the start, I was amazed. I really like this and have not taken it out of my cd player in my car or work for the last week. I guess this is rated lower than his previous work, which leads me to believe if you don't care for him, buy this. I think all the songs are strong and there is not a filler on here. Very impressive. Nice job.
B003HLM2QO|3.0|Like \\"Black Rain\\" this CD is very lost. The thing that made Ozzy stand out solo over his work with Sabbath is his songs had memorable catchy lyrics along with powerful music and always extraordinary guitar playing. Ozzmosis, IMO, was the first Ozzy CD I regarded as not a bad CD just a bad Ozzy CD. \\"Down To Earth\\" was far better. Now it's come down to Ozzy and this other guy, so-called writer/producer, doing the ProTools computer thing in a living room. This has left Ozzy's music as scattered and unfocused as the man himself. I have to say I like this CD more upon the 3rd or 4th listen but it still is a blithe on an amazing career and can't compare to past accomplishments. To me, it seems like this one and Black rain were a collection of songs kind of like Metallica's \\"Load\\" sounded like leftovers from the \\"Black\\" CD. As for the lack of Zakk, I believe the association with Ozzy and Zakk (regardless of what the rest of the robots here think)has grown tired. \\"Down To Earth\\" was interesting because Zakk had little to do with it. Joe Holmes was originally on it and writing it but Ozzy's people got nervous and dragged Zakk back in a Hail Mary last minute reworking. Songs like \\"Junkie\\" were interesting. BLS is cool and God bless Zakk on that deal with him. Ozzy needs a REAL guitarist/writer like Jake E Lee and a real band again with a producer like Keith Olson that produces and leaves the writing to the artist.
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I'm mid-way through the Kindle version of this book.  It's a good book, but I'm using this space to ensure people know: The editing on this sucks.  There are random italics, odd characters in the wrong place (e.g., ( or } or a misplaced \\"), wrong words (\\"Ring\\" for \\"King\\") and one part where half a phrase was missing.  I don't know if the bad editing (typesetting?) happened in the original, but it's VERY distracting.  Amazon should clean this up.
0061714372|4.0|Great book!! Comes across alot more honest than most, however doesn't paint the dark picture you'd expect to see from someone that's a self proclaimed a-hole and a 17 time rehabber. I hope the best is NOT behind him, which is kinda what the book leaves you thinking. If it is, Dave, do us all a favor and Kick LARS' f'ing teeth in!!
0307454541|4.0|slow at first and a little confusing with all the family names, but all in all a great read. Well paced and well written
B003IWYOF4|4.0|I admit it's been such a long time since I've seen the Breakfast Club that it felt a lot like the first time when I watched this on the recent Blu Ray release, so I really can't compare it to the DVD release or any others.  I can say, however, that I was very pleased with the picture quality.<br /><br />Fans know this movie has a very basic storyline, and very few scene changes.  But nonetheless, you still get a juicy taste of 1080p while watching it.  Facial closeups look crystal clear and gorgeous, while the background has fantastic depth.  This is particularly vivid during the ending speeches.  The depth is so perfect you have that great 3D feel that makes Blu Ray fans giddy.<br /><br />As far as grain and flickers are concerned, I didn't see any.  I may not be as picky as some HD scholars, but I was actively trying to look for any signs of a bad transfer nothing caught my immediate attention.<br /><br />My only complaint about this release, as is my complaint with just about every Universal release, is that the loading time is a little ridiculous.  I'm not sure if it's their main menu template or what, but all my Universal blus take ages to load.<br /><br />Overall, if you've never seen this movie you really ought to watch it.  Many try to make intelligent high school movies, but very few succeed.  The Breakfast Club is one of the lucky few.  It's heartfelt, it's emotional, it's well acted, directed, and written.  Its stood the test of time (25 years!) but thanks to blu ray, you can now watch it and feel like you're viewing a new release because of the perfect clarity.  Even if you have seen it a 1000 times, however, I'm willing to bet its worth the DVD upgrade.  Any chance you can get to increase the pixels of beautiful Molly Ringwald is worth it, IMO.
B0031SCV46|5.0|I have to say, this midi controller is awesome and the buyer delivered it immediately.  The product was as advertised, new condition and worked with ProTools LE 8 right out of the box.  I will definetely do business again with this seller.  I give the seller a \\"A+++++\\" on everything, shipping, packaging and reliability.    Good Job!!! Happy to do business with you. :)
B003ICWTR4|5.0|In May 2009, I saw Bruce in Greensboro, NC (my third B-ESB concert!) and I recall saying how awesome it would be to have a DVD of his 2009 tour.  Well, this concert, although in London, is a must-have to Bruce Fans. So many songs, plenty of the standard Bruce antics, and even some extra tunes at the end. Definitely recommend.    The only thing missing was Patti, but if I remember right, she was injured in that horse fall around the same time.    Buy it and jam out to your own personal concert. Looks great on a large-screen TV I can assure you.
1441866868|3.0|I don't read a lot of science-fiction (maybe five or so novels a year), but when I do, I tend to prefer works set in the relatively near-future, where the action mainly takes place on Earth. Having spent six weeks in Thailand a few years ago, this much-ballyhooed work set in Bangkok caught my attention and I thought I'd give it a whirl. The story takes place after \\"the Contraction\\", an era of global economic and ecological meltdown following the end of the petroleum-based economic system we currently are immersed in. In addition to rising sea levels (presumably due to global warming) which threaten to flood Bangkok, various killer viruses have spread across the global food supply chain, leaving giant GMO-based agribusinesses with virus-resistant grain product lines in positions of huge power. It's no longer Washington's shadow that falls heavily across the world, it's Des Moines'!<br /><br />The main characters include Anderson (an industrial spy for an American agribusiness) Hock Seng (the manager  of Anderson's front kinkspring manufacturing factory and a Chinese refugee from ethnic cleansing in Malaysia), Jaidee (a zealous and incorruptible Thai officer in the Ministry of Environment's enforcement army), and Emiko (the titular Japanese \\"windup girl\\" -- a genetically customized \\"new person\\" who is kept as a sex slave). The main thrust of the story is a contest for power between the Thai Ministry of the Environment, who is tasked with keeping the kingdom free of biological viruses, and the Thai Ministry of Trade, who naturally seeks to promote trade. The goals of the two ministries are at odds with each other, and the whole book is a long buildup to an inevitable showdown (and by extension, a rather transparent critique of capitalism).<br /><br />Amidst this brewing conflict, Anderson is trying to scheme his way into getting access to the Thai kingdom's ultra-secure seed bank. Hock Seng is trying to scheme his way into long-term financial and personal security by stealing potentially breakthrough technology from the factory he managers. Jaidee is trying to live up to the oath he swore to protect the kingdom. And Emiko is trying to find a way out of her perpetual abuse. The psychology, backstories, and motivations of these, and all the other characters, is rich and convincing. Similarly, many of the details of the post-Contraction Bangkok are quite vivid and well-done, and it's easy to get immersed in the city (although some aspects doesn't make a ton of sense, like the lack of wind or solar energy). There's a strong element of the thriller that runs throughout it, along with some pretty good action sequences (and several exceedingly graphic scenes of sexual debasement and rape that are not for the faint of heart, but are very relevant to the plot).<br /><br />And yet, despite all these positives, the book never really engaged me that much. It has a certain pacing problem that I can't quite put my finger on, but it often felt like it was taking too long to advance the story. The real kicker is that near the very end it starts to become very obvious that this is just the first installment of a series. That's particularly annoying because it would have been possible to end it in a way that would make it a satisfying stand-alone book, but there's more stuff tacked on as kind of a tease. I wish science-fiction and fantasy writers could take a page from mystery writers and learn how to write series where individual books can stand alone and not feel like incomplete segments of a trilogy.lly breakthrough technology from the factory he managers.

B00005B36H|5.0|This a great Tool cd with all great songs. All songs have that Tool sound that you  hear from their other CDs. Since I have got this CD, I been playing it over and over.If you are a Tool fan, you should get this CD.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|Great to have many different formats for Toy Story. We are huge fans and love that we have blu-ray, digital and regular DVD.
B0037QGS0A|2.0|I don't understand why this movie was adored by many people. Other reviewer already sait it all with the predictable plot from the first 30 minutes of the movie but what bothers me it's just it doesn't even make sense, spoiler will be here, review readers so be alarmed, please. Don't continue to read if you still want to watch th emovie yourself. Okay, how come Chloe (Amanda Siegfried) is the one who purposely dropped her hair holder just to talk to Julliane Moore's character?? when in the very beginning the movie told us that Chloe must know when to stop, when to put her hand, etc. while she can fall in love with a total stranger she never encounter and actually Julliane Moore's character is the one who has been observing Chloe?? this movie is trying to make it more heartfelt? more complicated? but it just doesn't deliver.... too much twist that doesn't make sense. The way the couple handle their realtionship, Liam Neeson's character told that he's sorry for all the staling relation they have since Julliane's character has stopped touching him then he himself rejecting her pursue? anyway, it's way overrated...  Everybody has their opinion though, thank you.
B002FRNCG0|5.0|I'd like to start out by saying I love All We Know Is Falling, then everything that came out after that was just mediocre until this album. This album is probably one of the best albums I've ever owned, and at least Paramore's best one for sure.<br /><br />The songs are catchy but not only that they are relatable, clever, and just downright awesome. Hayley's voice is a powerhouse as much as ever. The guitar and melodies are beautiful. But more than any of that stuff what really makes this album are the lyrics. This album puts into words all the things you've felt but never knew how to say.<br />I try to pick a favorite song from this album but it just constantly changes. I love \\"ignorance\\" for its sarcasm but then also its blatant honesty. \\"Brick By Boring Brick\\" is so pretty, and who can't relate to being innocent? \\"Playing God\\" We all know those people who think they are above everyone else. \\"Turn It Off\\" I sure can relate to wanting to turn that voice off in your head every once in a while and just not care. To me this album is way better than RIOT!, she's no longer singing about stealing people's boyfriends but about deeper emotions. I think some people were disappointed with this album, because they were wanting more of the teen rock songs like \\"Misery Business\\" or \\"CrushCrushCrush.\\" Instead of getting radio hits we got a deep emotional album, which I definitely prefer.
B0018GRAE4|4.0|This is no generic Metal album.  As a brand new listener who has listened to metal for years but just discovered 5FDP I have to say I am very impressed by this band's sound. Their unique sound is courtesy of both Moody's great singing and growling voice, as well as the obvious instrumental and melodic talent of the rest of the band.     The sound is great but the lyrical depth is average through most of the album. Certain songs shine through, notably \\"Salvation\\" and \\"The Bleeding\\" However the latter has enough raw feeling to convince the listener regardless of the words. Props to that.    These guys definitely have the talent, you don't make an album that sounds this good by chance, but they need to grow a bit lyrically to truly own their genre.
B002ZG9846|4.0|4.5 out of 5<br /><br />Dave Lizewski (Aaron Johnson), comic book geek and nobody-at-large, always wondered why no one stepped up and became a superhero. People aspire to be doctors and firemen and policemen, so why not also want to be someone else who helped his fellow man?<br /><br />After ordering a green and yellow wetsuit off the Internet, Dave dons the outfit and hits the streets as Kick-Ass, a superhero without powers, training or even a proper motivation to fight crime other than \\"what if?\\" The first few weeks are uneventful, and after his first attempt at stopping a car robbery nearly kills him, Dave returns more determined than ever to rid the streets of crime. Soon, after stopping the mugging of a fellow from a gang, Kick-Ass is all over the Internet and soon becomes a citywide celebrity.<br /><br />Little does he realize he's not alone. Enter Big Daddy (Nicholas Cage) and Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz), a father-daughter team of real-deal vigilantes with a thirst for blood and matching guns to boot. Their mission? Take out the D'Amico crime family, their leader, Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong), having been personally involved with Big Daddy long ago and robbing him of the one he loved.<br /><br />Soon Kick-Ass, Big Daddy, Hit Girl and newcomer Red Mist (Christopher Mintz-Plasse) are locked in a war that, hopefully, only the good guys survive.<br /><br />It's guns, action, comic books and bubble gum in this adaptation of Mark Millar and John Romita Jr.'s graphic novel.<br /><br />This movie is crazy. A good crazy. A special kind of crazy. I knew from the previews I was in for a different kind of superhero flick and, man, that was what I got. This was fresh, exciting, fun and new. Most superhero movies stick to a formula (origin of the good guy then the bad guy, a few tussles along the way leading to a big fight in the end, the stuff in between usually dramatic bits starring the hero in his personal life). With Kick-Ass, though there were those basic elements to it, the one thing that was really hammered home over and over again was the idea that, yeah, Kick-Ass was functioning in the real world. One with guns, knives, average fighting skills and no body armor. Some folks might think the violence in this film was overdone. Personally--despite a few exceptions--I didn't think so. You try doing the superhero thing in real life in a place like New York and see what happens.<br /><br />I also really liked how they dragged that fantasy of being a superhero into our reality and proved, really, that it wouldn't work. Kick-Ass went up against real bad guys. Ones without mercy. Without care. They'd kill their own mothers if they had to.<br /><br />The lack of a costumed supervillain also helped this movie and ensured the focus was kept on the good guys. I particularly liked Big Daddy's and Hit Girl's origin. It was simple, yet bittersweet and, if anything, really showed that despite being off his rocker, Big Daddy really loved his little girl and only wanted the best for her.<br /><br />In terms of the non-costumed scenes, Dave Lizewski's real life was extremely relatable (especially for this comic book nerd) and his high school years and mine seemed to have a lot in common. Except for the girlfriend part. I wasn't cool enough to have one of those.<br /><br />This movie was fantastic start to finish. The writing, the action, the realism--true cool.<br />My only thing was the profanity. I don't live in New York, but that was a lot of swearing and if people really talk like that in NYC, man, I feel sorry from them. (But, hey, I'm just a Maple Syrup-guzzling Canadian so what do I know?) If they don't, perhaps the writers can pull back a bit on the wagging tongue for the next one.<br /><br />Looking forward to the sequel.<br /><br />A.P.

B003X9W98G|4.0|As an American, I find it refreshing that the show is a little bit different spin on things than regular US tv shows. I like David Tenate a little better as the doctor, but several episodes of this season 5 have been fantastic. My gf Jill has even been able to get on board with the wild stores and imaginative enemies and plots.    If you love scifi, watch a few episodes of this and you will be hooked.
B000LGZHDS|1.0|I purchased this for my son to give my daughter for her 3rd birthday.  I was very happy to read that it was a nice size, great value price.  I assumed it WOULD be a good size because the item description says it weighs 3 pounds.  To my extreme disappointment when I opened the box, this Gary weighs MAYBE 3 ounces!  Although my daughter loves it, I was very upset.  Almost heartbroken that it was so much smaller than described.  I feel cheated!
B00006674X|5.0|This is my very favorite Elvis Presley movie.  You don't have to be a fan of Elvis to love this movie.  The chemistry between him and Mary Tyler Moore is great and believable and the story, itself, is a great story of 3 nuns who move into a neighborhood incognito (no one knows their nuns) to make a difference in the lives of the people and the neighborhood.  They work for a local doctor played by Elvis (who also does not know they are nuns) and the story revolves around their impact in the neighborhood and the lives of the people around them.  It is also a romantic story in the evolving relationship between Mary Tyler Moore's character and Elvis' character.  It is a great story and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00006CXSS|4.0|Fantastic show. Incredibly well made. Arrived in the condition described. One day later than expected. Love it.
B000RZIGSG|5.0|One of the 80s classics that I love.  An inspirational dreams come true movie with a love story too.  Would recommend to anyone.
1400052173|2.0|I was completely disappointed in this book.  It had so many rave reviews and came highly recommended by several friends, but it did not do it for me.  The author clearly has a passion for the subject and that came across, but it turns out she did not interest me at all in the family.  I'm also not certain what she was going for by portraying the family 'unedited'.  She did them no favors, and by focusing so much on the family now and so little on the actual Henrietta I don't think she accomplished her goal of making the world know who Henrietta Lacks was.
0061906220|5.0|I had heard this book years ago but waited until recently to buy it.  I should have gotten it much earlier.  My 3.5 year old and my 2 year old love it.  After one reading, they were telling the story on their own.  The illustrations are fun and the message is great.  We read several books every night for bedtime and I love when they ask for this one.  Both kids sing along and shout \\"Goodness No!\\" at the right spots.  It is helping my younger one with basic colors and my older one is able to recognize some of the words.  I would recommed it to EVERYONE!!!
B000EULJLU|5.0|The CD was in great condition when it arrived.  It arrived quickly after a couple of days.
B000N6U0E2|5.0|I loved it.  The only thing I wish it included is more of the portion of Chris Gardeners life as a millionaire.  I think the director (from italy) was right: we Americans don't know how lucky we are to live here.  People died to give us this economic and social freedom.  Now we gripe about having to pay for our own (gasp) medicine, as if we are entitled to it.
B000E9910W|2.0|FOR THOSE WHO REALLY KNOW ABOUT CLASSIC ROCK MUSIC:<br />You already know, the Doobies is one of those front-line bands of the best American Rock music...<br />You already know, most of the Pre-MMcD (Pre-Michael McDonald) Doobies albums, are a good sample of what 1970s West Coast Rock really is...<br />You already know, there's not much more to add if you have had the chance to go and enjoy Doobies Concerts, either with their original lineup -or even when Michael McDonald was \\"Doobie-zed\\" by Warner moguls.<br /><br />Therefore, the Doobies deserved a MUCH BETTER compilation effort...<br />A comprehensive, 4-CD compilation Box would be the most logical -and FAIR option.<br /><br />I got this 2-CD Doobies collection for sale, a Dutch issue (made in Europe)... Really cheap price.<br />Honestly, it has an AWESOME audio quality...<br /><br />BUT... The Bad News Are:<br />Gettin' so many Doobies classics in SINGLES cut version (\\"Listen To The Music\\", \\"Jesus Is Just Alright\\", \\"Nobody\\", \\"Wheels Of Fortune\\", \\"Dependin' On You\\", \\"Here To Love You\\")... No further comments.<br /><br />You should better save some extra money, get the original Doobies albums and really ENJOY the full-length version of all the Hits of these talented American musicians.<br /><br />Don't be cheated by new Rhino music-chopping habits...

030726999X|5.0|I'm discussing the trilogy first, and then I review this specific book (#3) at the end below.  Most of my reviews are romance novels, but this series is not.  I only mention it so that other romance lovers might consider it.<br /><br />THE TRILOGY:<br /><br />STORY BRIEF:<br />The three books must be read in order.  This is a hugely popular best-selling mystery suspense thriller about a few members of the Swedish national police organization forming a \\"special section\\" doing illegal things.  To shut up a 12-year-old witness, they have her placed in a mental institution.  Her name is Lisbeth Salander.  Mikhail Blomkvist is an investigative journalist.  In book 1, Salander who is now 24 helps Blomkvist solve a mystery about a woman who disappeared.  In books 2 and 3, Salander has a variety of problems resulting from \\"special section\\" activities.  A number of interesting characters are involved.

I know I will continue to think about Salander and this story well into the future.  Book 1 can be read as a stand-alone, but I wanted more Salander so I bought book 2.  Book 2 stops in the middle of the story which is ok as long as you get book 3 to keep reading right away.  I loved the three books.  This is not a predictable, run-of-the-mill mystery thriller.  There are a wide range of characters and plot intricacies that are wonderfully well done.  I was so taken with these books that I bought the audio versions AND the paper versions for books 2 and 3.  I've never done that before.  That way I could continue with the story when I was driving and doing kitchen work.  I would switch to the hard copy when sitting.<br /><br />In the first book, Salander felt like a modern day replacement for Sherlock Holmes, but very different.  They both are brilliant in their special skills, and draw my admiration.  However, Salander is gritty, edgy, and anti-authority.  She despises the police and refuses to allow them to have information about anything.  There was a lot of action with Salander in the last half of the first book.  I loved reading about her.  I was hoping to see a lot of action with Salander in books 2 and 3 - seeing her solve other mysteries and doing damage to bad guys.  But that didn't happen.  Books 2 and 3 are more about other characters doing things - murders, cover-ups, and investigating - but it was all surrounding and relating to Salander.  She had less action than I wanted in the last two books.  But still, I fully enjoyed books 2 and 3.<br /><br />The English-language film of the first book will be in theaters in 2011.  Daniel Craig will play journalist Mikael Blomkvist.  Unfortunately, as with most movies, there's no way it will be as rich as the books.<br /><br />ABOUT THE AUTHOR:<br />Steig Larsson wrote these three books, submitted them to a publisher, and then died before they were published.  He had written half of a fourth book which I believe his girlfriend may be finishing.  He had an outline and planned to write several more in the series.

Well I ended up reading all 3 in 9 days and then I was annoyed with myself because I had finished them so soon.  I really wish the author was still alive and could do interviews and write more books.  So sad he's gone.

B0036TGSR6|3.0|\\"The Ghost Writer\\" is an adaptation of Robert Harris' political thriller \\"The Ghost\\", written for the screen by Harris and director Roman Polanski while the novel was still in progress. An unnamed writer (Ewan McGregor) is hired to put the finishing touches on the memoirs of former British Prime Minister Adam Lang (Pierce Brosnan) after the ghostwriter who was working on the project drowns. The new Ghost qualifies for the job, against the objections of his editor, by being fast, British, best-selling, and completely oblivious to politics. He heads to Martha's Vineyard in the United States, where Lang is living while a scandal brews in Europe. Lang's former Foreign Secretary Richard Rycart (Robert Pugh) has accused Lang of authorizing the illegal handover of terrorist suspects for torture by the CIA. The International Criminal Court is investigating Lang for war crimes and human rights violations.<br /><br />The Ghost steps into Lang's modernist beach house and into a world of politics and intrigue that he does not understand. He's just there to transform Lang's words into punchy prose. But things get dicey when he begins to investigate some leads that his predecessor had apparently followed to his death. The first hour of the film is striking in the number of extraneous shots and scenes that run too long. Tightening it up would have cured the excessive length. The cast is impressive in the depth and breadth of its talent, but the acting style is almost parody at times. I think that Polanski is invoking crime melodramas of the mid-20th century. But it doesn't work here, as not one of the characters comes across as a real person. That's an impediment when you're trying to comment on, or at least allude to, current events. The most obvious case is Kim Cattrall's kittenish portrayal of Lang's assistant Amelia. It's pure caricature and seems incongruous with her lines -which she delivers in an unidentifiable accent.<br /><br />Worse, the story doesn't make sense. The Ghost suspects that he is in danger, but he trusts everyone without reason, as if he has a death wish. The plot relies on people knowing things that they shouldn't logically know. It's badly written. People don't act this way, and the story is not self-contained. It runs too long. It doesn't make sense. Characters are over-the-top when they should be compelling. Olivia Williams, who plays Lang's wife Ruth, is 15 years younger than Pierce Brosnan, when part of the mystery hinges on them having met when they were young. The interiors of Lang's beach house were filmed on a set, as was necessary because of lighting. But the huge glass windows never have any sand, rain, or reflections on them. They're perfectly clear, as if they don't exist. A minor point, but I found it distracting. Why even 3 stars? \\"The Ghost Writer\\" is an entertaining mess. As long as you don't' think about it, it will entertain you as it goes along, though probably not in the end.<br /><br />The DVD (Summit Entertainment 2010): There are 3 featurettes on the disc. \\"The Ghost Writer: Fiction or Reality?\\" (10 min) interviews author Robert Harris about the evolution of the book, characters, and his collaboration with Polanski. \\"The Cast of The Ghost Writer\\" (11 min) interviews co-producer Timothy Burrill and the principle cast about working with Polanski and about performances.

B003XDUCIG|5.0|This isn't your ordinary cookbook. Sure, there are recipes--good ones, too--but the author presents a wealth of information about the science of cooking, cooking techniques, and even the psychology of cooking. It's not so technical that you need a degree in chemistry to understand it. Instead, the author explains things like how human taste senses work in plain terms. There's also a bit on nutrition towards the beginning, and there are charts and tables now and then to illustrate the mechanics of food and cooking throughout.<br /><br />If you're an \\"innovative cook\\" (see the interview with Brian Wansink, p. 7), this is right up your alley. Potter gives lots of hacks. Usually, cookbooks are very prescriptive and give exact measurements and ways of doing things. Here, the author encourages us to improvise, and he even gives great tips how to do so. For example, did you know you can roast peppers in a toaster?<br /><br />I have dozens of cookbooks and love to cook. Cooking For Geeks has surpassed them all and is now my favorite one. Check it out yourself. Well worth the money.
B000WAEK0E|5.0|as with any great artist it is hard to get all the hits onto one collection.  this set has plenty of misses. i especially miss blue money and other domino/moondance/tupelo era songs. however what is here is excellent and most of the well known songs are represented.the sound was the main reason for me to upgrade  my old greatest hits and get this collection.
0393072231|4.0|Not being versed in the language of the financial markets, I found myself looking up a lot of terms, but the book is fascinating.  It began a lot of conversations with my friends and I happily passed the book along to others.  The personalities of the people in the book made it even more interesting.  The whole episode sounds like gambling to me and I am not a gambler, so I lived vicariously in that world.

B003VDZK8K|5.0|I only got into Avenged Sevenfold after their self-titled album.  This is a continuation of that album both musically and lyrically.  They seem to mature more with each album.  I wasn't really into their older, more scream-oriented music, but the newer stuff has more of a hard rock/metal sound to it.    This album sounds like it has a lot of influences of 80's Metallica with some Pantera mixed in.    \\"Nightmare\\" is awesome, and I've been blasting it since the single came out on the radio.  Tracks 2 and 3 are decent, nothing amazing though.    Tracks 4 through 7 are undoubtedly the BEST songs on the album, my favorite being track 5 (\\"Natural Born Killers\\").  \\"NBK\\" has so many elements mixed together that I can listen to it on end and not get tired or bored of it.  Great double bass drum beats, layered guitars, and probably the best vocals on the album.    Altogether, this is one of the best new albums I've heard in a LONG time... and I'm glad that Avenged Sevenfold keeps improving and evolving with each album.  It's very sad that I couldn't get into them earlier so I could have seen them in concert while Jimmy \\"The Rev\\" was still alive.
B00005R2M3|1.0|I think her voice is irritating because of it's gutteral quality.  She also sings all over the scale all the time and doesn't seem to have any vocal control at all.  I only liked 2 songs, which were \\"Underneath Your Clothes\\" and \\"Whenever Wherever.\\"

B003EYVXXW|3.0|The major character in this large-scale film, \\"Agora\\" (2009) is Hypatia of Alexandria (350? - 415 A.D.), a beautiful and brilliant philosopher and mathematician performed by Rachel Weisz.  Set in Alexandria, Egypt, this film is an expensive, lavish production, a throwback in many ways to other extravagant epics set in ancient Greece or Rome.  The film is Spanish in origin and directed by Alejandro Amenebar. The movie is serious in intent. It portrays Hypatia as a scholar without religious belief intent only upon free disinterested scientific inquiry.  She is caught in the turbulence of 4th Century Alexandria in the decaying Roman Empire in the violence among pagans, Jews, and Christians.  The violence results in the destruction of the storied Library of Alexandria, a treasure house of wisdom in the ancient world.  Religious fanaticism and sectarianism also leads to Hypatia's death at the hands of a Christian mob.<br /><br />Other than Weisz' portrayal of the heroine, the acting in this movie tends to be wooden and the dialogue stilted. The most effective scenes are those of Hypatia in her study.  She is a renowned teacher whose students include individual from all creeds and status united only by the desire to learn. She is a geometer who has studied the properties of cones. A student of Ptolemy, Hypatia becomes skeptical of his geocentric model of the solar system in which the earth is at the center. She becomes interested in the theory that the planets revolve around the sun. The difficulties she finds in this theory result from, among other things, the teleological view of reality she inherits from Plato and Aristotle which teaches that movement of astronomical bodies in their orbits must be circular because the circle is the most perfect shape. The movie shows Hypatia working away from this theory towards a more modern understanding.<br /><br />Much of the movie consists of the mob scenes and violence common to epic films of the ancient world.  There is large-scale, brutal fighting between Christians and pagans and between Christians and Jews as the Christians are shown as mindlessly and violently destroying what was best in the ancient world.  In the film, Hypatia is shown as having at least three suitors, one a former slave, and another a highly placed prefect who tries to bring a balance between the claims of the Church and the competing voices of paganism.  Hypatia rejects romantic love in scenes that are muffled in their purpose and mostly confused.<br /><br />The problem I found with the movie was that its format does not work to convey the complexity of the issues that it tries to raise.  Instead, it offers what on its face is a garish, expensive production which, whatever its virtues as entertainment, does not encourage reflection. \\"Agora\\" has its heart in the right place in its skepticism and commitment to free inquiry, but the cost is great oversimplification of philosophical and historical issues and anachronism. While this movie has been praised for its portrayal of free inquiry and for its critique of religious exclusivism, it doesn't grapple in any depth with its themes. A rather free-wheeling historical epic seems to me to contrast with the quiet, independent spirit and thought that the movie tries properly to attribute to Hypatia. I was frustrated by the movie and unconvinced that it left me wiser than I had been before about Alexandria, Hypatia, or religion and science.  It seems to me that the movie substitutes one set of oversimplified platitudes for another.<br /><br />Robin Friedmanghting between Christians and pagans and between Christians and Jews as the Christians are shown as mindlessly and violently destroying what was best in the ancient world.

0894803123|5.0|You cannot go wrong with this book!  It's not only recipes, but tips and tricks and cleverly told background stories.  Not a fan of the chocolate chip cookie recipe though I must say.  Not sweet enough for mine and my family's tastes.
B003JLA4KS|5.0|Rush is a band that has always done their own thing --whether the masses liked them or not...whether their fans at the time liked the next thing they were about to do or not. This doc does such a great job of showing off a band that truly did it their way, did their thing great, and quietly carved out a legacy in Rock -- particularly prog rock that stands the test of time. This is a great Doc for the Rush freak fan (which a lot of us are) and for the music lover who was a casual fan at some point -- or even the wife, ex-wife, girlfriend, ex-girlfriend who never undestood why a guy could love this band so. Whether you never liked them, like every song they write or barely remember Tom Sawyer, you won't be able to help identifying with them as people, going through life in business, as friends, and as artists through decades of music together. It's a portrait of a life to strive for -- doing something you like, doing it as well as you possibly can, paying attention to your own opinion of what's cool, and doing it with people you like to be around.
B003KUSUG8|5.0|i do not typically listen to eminem (except what happens to play on the radio), but for some reason i was drawn to this cd. i am very pleased with my purchase. i think the songs all have a distinct sound and i can listen to the whole cd (even the song featuring pink which i have read others say is the weak point of this album).<br /><br />dont misunderstand my review, and think that you'll like this cd even if you dont normally listen to this type of music. you wont like this if you cannot tolerate any of his other music, bc he is still who he is. im just not a huge fan of his, but i am a huge fan of this cd.
0375413405|4.0|Fell in love with the movie, Julie and Julia. It motivated me to purchase the book and try Julia's bruschetta recipe... However, I could not find it anywhere in the book. :-( I big dissapointment. Some of the dishes were a little too much work for me, since I work full time and attend college full time... so I have to admit and did not try any of the recipes yet. Some day... soon... time off for myself... I'll treat myself to a nice dish from her book. Hopefully, that day will come soon. It's just sitting on my shelf.

B000AP04OM|4.0|i adore this movie. most people already know what the movie is about or have seen it, so this review is for this particular edition.<br /><br />i watched all the extras on the two dvds and while they are interesting and enjoyable, after awhile it seems like there are repeats of certain behind the scene details or stories. i dont mind this because i have watched this movie ever since i was a kid and i will continue watching it. i just wanted to mention the special features start feeling all the same when you sit and watch them through.
B003EYVXSC|3.0|It seems as though I have a lot of catching up to when it comes to director Jean-Pierre Jeunet. With Amelie in the top 250 on IMDb and many people talking about how great both Delicatessen and The City of Lost Children are, it's definitely something I'll have to look into. In the meantime, before Micmacs Alien: Resurrection had been the only film of Jeunet's that I'd seen. It had been way too long since my last viewing of that, so I didn't make the connection that it was the same director until after Micmacs was over. There are quite a lot of positive reviews and comments about Micmacs all over the internet, so I felt like I had to see it. Unfortunately, it didn't click with me as much as it did with others.<br /><br />The film does have a unique look to it that was originally what grabbed a hold of my interest. The first thing that comes to mind is how quirky and eccentric the animation and visual effects are. Whether it's the mechanical creatures Petit Pierre creates with recycled materials or the unusual bits of animation in the film, it's all incredibly eye catching.<br /><br />The biggest element the film is missing, however, is character development. There really seems to be not much of any in this film. You're introduced to these oddball characters, but then the rest of the film is devoted to this intricate plan on how to take down these two weapons manufacturers. Even the one subplot that has two of the characters fall in love doesn't get enough screen time. It's like the film becomes too wrapped up and involved within its own whimsical desires to really establish much of anything else. To add to that, the film isn't really funny despite being labeled as a comedy. It has its short lived charming moments that will put a smile on your face, but there's maybe one or two scenes that might make you snicker audibly.<br /><br />Micmacs devotes too much time to its playfully involved and original tale of revenge that results in you not really caring about the characters by the time the film ends. It's visually stunning, but has little to offer other than fantastic visuals that ooze creativity from every frame. Despite being a rather elaborate tale of revenge, the film is slightly reminiscent of what Michel Gondry's take on Snatch would be like. Whether that's good or bad lies entirely within the person viewing the film.ilm ends.

B000EOTEPO|5.0|I loaded this one on my iPOD before I decided to sell it (since I thought it sucked).  Poor, stupid me.  Since then I've listened (giving it due time) and have decided this is definately one of the best BM albums I've heard.  Sniff, Sniff.  Moron!<br /><br />Absolutely AWESOME!
0061801313|5.0|i loved these books it is a nice relief from all the paranormal books crowding the shelf not that I do not love them I do but it is refreshing to have a different book every now and the this series is soo awesome it keeps you guessing lots of different stories mingle together wonderfully the characters are very different and written wonderfully I already ordered the next books in the series
B003VIWO8Y|4.0|Just finished my copy of Dave's Memoir. I have to say first that I am a huge fan and collect/enjoy all things Dave from information about him, to his Dean signature models, and even his autograph. Secondly, I am both satisfied with his recollection of events from his life, and a little more critical of some of the details he went into that were not necessary( A-1 Steak Sauce, anyone?) than other reviewers. The book overall is informative, comical, tragic, and you certainly can \\"feel\\" the darkness that enshrouded most of his life.<br />  A lot of the information given in this book was already known to me, however it was great to get Dave's explanation of things from his perspective. I certainly got the feeling that he was as honest as he could be about most of the things mentioned. I can also see a side of him that others have warned about in the past. As I mentioned earlier, some descriptions of things sexual in nature were to me just crude, and really had no place in the flow of the story other than just for shock value. But hey, were talking about my hero Dave, and that is just who he is.<br />  Overall I found this a very interesting read, and found answers to questions about his life that I had often wondered about. I would have loved to speak to him more when he was signing an Autograph for me at a show, but that kind of time is just not given for a \\"fan\\". I hope that Dave continues to shine the torch for Metal, and that he continues finding peace in his Faith in Christ. And maybe one day I'll actually get the chance to make friends with the guy who was just a little bit on the dangerous side.<br />  Make sure to purchase your copy and be able to lay to rest all the bull that has been heaped up on this guy who for the love of music (I can relate heavily) made a dent in music history. Great job Dave!!
B00005KARK|5.0|This movie rules. One of the best films to come out in the 1940's. Great animation,great storyline,great songs,unforgettable characters & a great moral. You should'nt mock someone just becuase they're different from you. There are some racial stereotypes in which I will not name but it is still a great movie to watch. I give this film a 9 out of 10.
B003A4IFDW|3.0|CD arrived quickly and in good condition. But as for the compilation, arrangement and production, I expected more.  I had heard a shining review of this particular CD.  With qualities reminiscent of Tina Turner, no doubt, Bettye LeVette has great vocal character and talent but the arrangements and choices of songs fell flat for me.  It may be that over time I will acclimate to LeVette's interpretations.  May be not.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|The movie of course, is fantastic.  BluRay is clear as a bell.  My dissatisfaction is not with Amazon, but with the technology.  I wasn't aware until I watched this movie with my grandchildren that it cannot be turned off, then resume where you left off.
1582701709|1.0|I believe in the law of attraction and have applied it my life to better myself and those around me.  However, this book leads you to believe that the universe is your personal slot machine.  The author intentionally focus on the \\"show me the money\\" aspects to sell the book and movie. If the gist had been on becoming happier, bettering humanity, loving life, etc., it would have sold a fraction of what it has. Clearly Rhonda's motivation and her own Law of Attraction was to make big bucks and get enough speakers that would back her materialistic view on life.  In my opinion, Neale Donald Walsch and Michael Beckwith have no business in this movie. Their message is about listening to your soul and loving yourself and your fellow man/woman.  They have no problem with money and outward success, but money at the expense of soul and conscience is not something they support.     If you want to get rich, go back to school.  You have about as big a chance of cashing in on this book as you do a lottery ticket but the lottery ticket is cheaper and the small print on the back is more interesting than this crap!
B0026S1XD2|5.0|My husband is British and when I found this on Amazon, I couldn't resist buying it as part of his birthday gift. As a matter of fact, I bought him another CD with more music on it. He Loved it and listens to it often. We sit out in the middle of the water on our boat and just lay there listening to this CD and It is so peaceful. Very Serene. You will not go wrong with this music especially if you're a Brit.
0679809015|5.0|This is the second time I have purchased this book for my grandson. He completely wore the first one out.  I originally purchased this book for my 4 month old grandson when I gained custody of him.  He played with the book all the time.  I would read the book to him daily and imitate the animal sounds to make reading more interesting to him.  My grandson is now 14 months old.  This is still his favorite book.  He would rather play with and read his books than he had play with a toy.  He has had no trouble opening the little doors or windows in the book and he has been doing that since he was 5-6 months old. We have worn out the original book I purchased for him. I've had to maskin tape the spine twice to keep the book together.  My grandson adores this book. He attempts to imitate the animal noises himself now that he is a little older and more interactive. It is a great size for my grandson.  Easy to handle and hold with his little hands when he opens it.  The book is solid and put together well.  The flaps are good and sturdy- not flimsy and easily torn like some of the more expensive yet cheaply made books.  I have purchased several books for my grandson and I would highly recommend this one as a starter book.
B002SF9YUM|5.0|This movie is FANTASTIC! That said, people who are expecting to see Pattinson play Dali the same way he is in Twilight, or even Remember Me, will be pleasantly surprised at his actual range as an actor.<br /><br />Little Ashes is about Salvador Dali's time in Madrid at an Art School in the 1920's. Surrounding the story of his growing, and often strained, relationship with Federico Garcia Lorca is the growing political turmoil in Spain that ultimately brings about Federico's demise.<br /><br />This movie completely utilizes Pattinson's strengths as an actor in ways that I have never seen before. It's absolutely wonderful to see him in this role which allowed him such versatility while still respecting the story and the character he was playing; remembering that Dali was a real person with real passions and eccentricities.<br /><br />Javier Beltr&aacute;n, who plays Lorca is fantastic! The gritty passion he brings to this character, while still implementing the strong religious backgrounds of the time, regarding the sexual relationship he so desires with Dali is astounding. It's worth watching over and over again. I honestly don't think that this movie would have worked as well if any other actor played this part.<br /><br />There are scenes that are so raw you literally cringe with sympathy for the characters and there are scenes filled with delicate longing and passion. It's beautifully written and produced.<br /><br />I was just so impressed. There aren't many movies that have the ability to actually make you FEEL something, but this one does. Watch it. Then, like me, you'll watch it again.
1843106698|5.0|An excellent book. It is a well written and professional book which offers useful insights. I found it very helpful with the accounts of other peoples experiences and case studies and the explanations that accompanied these.  Highly recommended.
1439175640|4.0|The pages are hard to turn and there are not enough pictures of the recipes.
B000002J1O|5.0|El mejor disco de Genesis y uno de los mejores discos de la historia de la musica. Junto con The Lamb lies down on Broadway, Foxtrot y A trick of the tail, crearon una atmosfera musical y creativa muy difixcial de igualar.  Una joya que no debe de perderse nadie a quien le guste la musica
B003A4IFGY|5.0|Many of the reviewers seem to be in two camps; those who dig the bluesy jamming vibe of this release while the other camps that prefer the more radio friendly hits.  Here is a point the later is missing, the system that promoted those hits, mainly radio, well radio don't play much new rock anymore especially from veteran rock artist. There were tracks from The Last DJ and Echo that would have been hits in the old days but I never heard any of those songs played on the dial so the trend started back then. I for one don't rely on radio anymore to find new music; I rely on other sources with amazon.com being one of them. So with no support from radio why should TP&Heartbreakers try to make radio friendly music. Forget the format and make music buy following your instincts which is the path that Petty has been on since the country rock Mudcrutch CD and now the blue drenched MOJO. TP & Heartbreakers never fail to amaze me, either TP solo or with the Heartbreakers, listening to a new release from either is like enjoying a good steak dinner, I've always felt full and satisfy. While there been a few changes in the Heartbreakers lineup throughout the years, the core member have remain largely intact and during the decades of recording and touring they just reach to newer level of tightness and musical ship which really shows on MOJO.     It amazing me that the second camp reviewers write that the MOJO songs are not up to his usual standard of writing. True, while no particular track stands out, the entire body of work is of such high quality that there are no skip through cuts either. Here are a few observations on some of the songs that I noticed.  Trip to Pirates Cove has a Doors Riders on The Storm feel to it, Benmont Tench's keyboard work has a very feel that Ray Manzarek play on that Doors track. Just add some thunder sounds to the mix. Candy reminds me of a Tony Joe White hit Pork Salad Annie and if you heard the Toney Joe White you know what I mean. Both songs do mention turnip greens in fact lyrics for both songs would be swiped with one another.   That is my two cents worth.
0061906220|5.0|I love Pete the Cat and have read it to my Kindergarten class and shared it with teachers and friends.  It has also been a great gift idea!  Everyone I know LOVES Pete the Cat!  Pete has a great following and we want more!  It was great for introducing color words in Kindergarten.  The CD is also so much fun!
0061478784|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect from this book, but I loved it. I had a hard time putting it down to go to sleep.
B000GCFY0I|5.0|I was never bored, and thats saying something.  Uglies is a good book to read again and again.  I absolutly (I know it's spelled wrong, don't judge me) loved it!  If Scott Westerfeld can make the others just as good as this, I will worship the ground he walks on!
B0039UTDFG|5.0|If you got this version like I didn't without knowing of having the chance to get the \\"superior\\" version, don't worry.  Oprah isn't as bad as all these people are complaining about.  They are just used to the other guy who have done the previous series.  IF Oprah did it from the beginning and they changed it to the other guy, they would be complaining about him.  She speaks clearly and personally it's sounds better than a low monotone male voice, that usual puts people to sleep.  At first I didn't even know it was Oprah, and was waiting for the annoying voice everyone complained about... It never came.  The series is GREAT, and that should be your basis for getting this.  It's beautiful, and like the previous series you will learn something.  GET THIS OR THE OTHER VERSION NOW!!!  Don't let peer pressure make you get another version when this one is fine as it is.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Since when can you out write Hunger Games?  Well, since now!  Catching Fire was even better then it's first book.  Suzanne Collins has taken her place among all the most amazing writers in the world.<br />I just can't believe that Collins would end her book that way and then make me wait for MONTHS for the next one.  It's like she wrote that whole book just so she could write that last chapter.  Poor Peeta, who am I kidding, poor me, I have to wait for the ending of this series, but I don't want it to end!  I'M INCERDIBLY CONFUSED!!!!!!!<br />The big fight is really, should Katniss get Peeta or Gale.  Are you all stupid or something?  The one and only answer is Peeta!  The only way she's going to be able chose anyway is if one dies and she's left with only the other one to chose.  Or they could both die and Katniss could realize how she should have chosen while they were still alive (yes I do have an evil mind, thank you).  Well something needs to happen!<br />Well it's hard to close a review of the best book in the world so I will just say one thing.  SUZANNE COLLINS ROX MY SOX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
0553288105|5.0|Once an imaginative genius like Isaac Asimov concocts a world where it takes three entities to make a baby, it then seems obvious to us mere mortals that the idea could be developed into an interesting science fiction book.  However, there still are details to work out, such as making the three characters interesting and developing a plot that keeps a reader on edge.  Professor Asimov manages to do just that in this book, which was his return to science fiction novels after quite a long hiatus where he concentrated on non-fiction.  It is a delightful and entertaining book, one of the professor's very best.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I'm ashamed any of you people would rate Hunger Games less than ten stars.  I can forgive you if it was an accident, but you and I both know that it wasn't an accident.  This book passed up Uglies and Harry Potter on my favorite list.  How can you live with the guilt of rating Hunger Games a four or less?  I hope the guilt kills you!<br />Hunger Games can not be outwritten!
0385523904|5.0|I sat up to the early hours of the morning reading this important piece of literature. Well written, it's hard to believe an entire country accepts the atrocities its government carry's out its own people.
0897500482|4.0|This is a great book in the master's own words! Some things are a bit hard to understand but I think anyone would have trouble describing some moves/ideas without a demonstration.
0465011047|5.0|What a messed up, bizarrely horrific leadership which attempts to run that country! It's amazing the people of North Korea accept this rule which is beyond evil. Truly  eye opening, more people need to be informed what is going on in North Korea.
0395951054|4.0|I am rating \\"Mein Kampf\\" with 4 stars due to the translation & introduction by Ralph Manheim and Abraham Foxman. Also, due to the importance and significance of reading this piece. Though cringe-worthy it may be, this is an important piece of Literature.<br /><br />My personal feelings towards the material...<br />It is an incredibly long and at many times redundant read. Be ready to set aside some time. Before attempting to read this book, make sure that you have a strong foudation in your own worldview perspective. Remember while reading, that like the Angel of Light himself, Hitler has ways of peppering truth in the midst of insanity and lies. At times you may find yourself in agreement with him, in regards to some of the reasons of Germany's downfall, which can be psychologically torturing. It is relieving once he reveals his answers to these problems, which are completely void of sanity, and hopefully like myself, the reader will find no commonality. Having read this book, it is easy to understand how someone not strongly founded and perhaps in a defeated moment may look to a Hitler for answers. It would be wise that this book be read by all in order to steer clear of such cults of personality.<br /><br />NOTE: I do not condone the ideas below, they are Hitler's, and his alone.<br /><br />Now, I hope to objectively summarize...<br /><br />Reasons for Germany's downfall...International Capital (Marxism) verses National Capital (National Socialism). Increased population. Growing difference between the rich and poor. Unemployment. Money worshiping culture. Aristocracy controlling finance capital. Loss of private property rights. Property rights transferred to stock companies. Internationalized economic life. War against heavy industry. Weak education system. The ultimate reason for the decline was failure to recognize the racial problem. German states began to dissolve as Reich began to take from them. The states were in financial bondage to the Reich. The Reich took away rights as it took away property.<br /><br />The Race War...Jews are the masters of lies. Aryans are the Prometheus of Mankind. All other races are chaff. Lower human beings must be used. The Jew is the mightiest counterpart of the Aryan. The Jew exploits and plunders all nations. The Jew, in his attempts, overthrows governments. Unconsciously, many Germans fight for the enemy, the Jew. The purpose for Israel being a nation would be to have a central organization for their international world swindle, endowed with sovereign rights, removed from state intervention, and a haven for scoundrels. Jews are mongrels and a lesser race. Jews are ape men. Aryans are physical perfection, Jews are bow-legged. The Jews struggle for world conquest.<br /><br />The Answer...The attention of a people mustn't be divided, but concentrated on a single foe. The fight must be posed as a fight for \\"freedom.\\" The effect must be aimed at the emotion and only to a limited degree the intellect. The use of propaganda, whose task is not to make an objective study of the truth, but is to serve our own right. Supporter of conscription. Only give the people what they need to know, not the ultimate plan. Treatment of the body is not a private affair; there is no freedom to sin at the cost of the race. Personal freedom recedes before the duty to preserve the race. Sterilization of the unfit. Must take over labor unions and the press. Masses must be nationalized. Leader should be a hero. There should be a strong, uncompromising party. Continuous mutual higher breeding to create the best of humanity. Aryans are the master race and must put the world into service of a higher culture. Racial purity must be established. The youth must be educated to be a valuable link. Clothing should be adapted to physical exertion. Youth must be supervised by the State even after school hours.

B000FC0SIM|5.0|I've never been a horror fan- I don't enjoy being scared- so I had never read a Steven King book in my life until this one. He has a gripping life story, told in true story teller fashion, and I could hardly put it down. His writing instruction was gripping, as well, and I have started reading some of the authors from his reading list.   I'm rarely moved enough by a book I read to post a comment, but this book was worth a minute of my time.  Mr. King, I am happy you survived your appointment with the driver of the Dodge van.

0307277453|5.0|This is a book that I highly suggest to someone who has an interest in biology at a novice's level.  Neil Shubin, one of the discoverer's of the Titkaalik fossil, a unique transitional form of species with both amphibian and lobe-finned fish like characteristics.  The author talks about his experience hunting fossils, giving credit to his predecessors who would use their prowess to find mammal teeth in the desert southwest.  He also gave some background regarding the search for intermediarries between fish and amphibians and the types of sediments such species were likely to be found in.  The search, going from roadcuts in the appalachians to the permafrost of the arctic, ultimately came up with the significant Titkaalik fossil that made such headlines.<br /><br />Giving us novice biologists a little lesson on the evolution of tetropod appendages, and how the fins of fish evolved into more sturdy structures that could bear weight under the conditions of living on land, the author shows evolution in action over millions of years and shows how the structures of all tetropod descendents of Titkaalik-like species evolved common characteristics in their limbs showing their common ancestry.<br /><br />Other lessons from evolutionary biology are also taught in the book, from the evolution of the inner ear from studying shark embryos, to studying primitive worms and what they tell us about cell structure and communication between cells.<br /><br />There is alot in this book to explore, and I am hopeful that subsequent books of this sort will be produced by this author, because he shows a real talent for making biology interesting and understandable.  I highly recommend this book.
B002ZFQD0E|5.0|I'm in love with this album that a friend of mine turned me on to.  Reminds me of Avalanchers and Thievery Corporation.  Album is chalk full of variety but keeps a consistent fun beat throughout.  Highly recommend.
0784010501|5.0|This video is just Madonna making you think you're getting a backstage look at her life in a documentary between some awesome Madonna performances. There is no way control freak Madonna let a frame of this video be released without her approval.<br /><br />It's a really interesting piece of work. Even if you don't care for Madonna's politics, lifestyle, or even the so called documentary parts of the video you will enjoy her performances. It's worth buying just for that.<br /><br />You get to see Madonna's father and her brother. Her dad comes off as a very normal guy. Her brother comes off as a regular guy that takes full advantage of his sister's fame, cashing in on the chance to pick up chicks. He's not the jealous type and even seems proud of his sister. The kind of guy that doesn't plan his day. He just wakes up and sees what happens.<br /><br />Notice what a talented speaker Madonna is in this film. Even when she's reading silly things she's written just for a friend's party she is verbally flawless. She even admits that she knows she's not the best singer or dancer. As compared to the current crop of female singing and dancing superstars, with maybe the exception of Beyonce, she's still better. Beyonce had a Madonna to study before her career began. Madonna actually invented a style that a lot of people attempt to copy.<br /><br />There are some weird scenes. Like the one where Madonna rests her head on her mother's gravestone like a pillow. There is no doubt that she's a very intelligent, hard worker that's in charge of her world and strives for perfection. She surrounds herself with gays, people that just look gay, and very capable yes men that know Madonna's word is rule.<br /><br />No Madonna fan's collection of Madonna stuff is complete without a copy of \\"Madonna - Truth or Dare\\". If you can find a copy, thank your lucky star.
006145205X|4.0|If you don't already believe that we now live in the most prosperous era in human history, The Rational Optimist should convince you. Every generation before us lived shorter, harder lives, with more dangers and fewer freedoms. And things will almost certainly keep getting better and better, as the market continues to support further innovation and specialization.<br /><br />Ridley argues this point exhaustively with a constant stream of numbers and factoids. Indeed, the book's broad argument is frequently bogged down in details. Nevertheless, this is a book that anyone who questions the desirability of a free market should grapple with.
B003INBOEM|5.0|In \\"Ip Man\\", director Yip Wai Shun has constructed a 1930's biopic that combines epic martial arts footage with a moving storyline encompassing family, friendship and betrayal. A master of Wing Chun, a Chinese martial arts discipline passed down orally since the Qing dynasty, Ip Man (played by Donny Yen, who until this film had never practised Wing Chun) is a respected teacher who is seen as the ultimate sparring opponent in the Guandong town of Fo Shan. Known for it's multitude of martial arts \\"schools\\", Fo Shan streets are lined up with storefronts of teachers hoping to acquire potential students. Early scenes show how competitors knocked on the door of Ip Man's home to test their skills against his in an effort to supercede his legendary prowess in an attempt bring in more business. Sammo Hung, the action director for the film, interpolates the various fighting styles used against Ip Man with amazing success. When a northern fighter Jin Shanzhao (played by Fan Sui Wong) in the hope of setting up his own school in Fo Shan knocks on Ip Man's door for a fight, he spars with a variation of Shao Bei Fist, a loose, almost dance-like style. This juxtaposes awesomely with Man's Wing Chun - which is tight and disciplined, using a centerline defensive stance traditionally fought in close combat style. Ultimately, Ip Man defeats the northerner with a feather duster pulled from a vase in his ornately decorated home.<br /><br />With the Japanese invasion of China in 1937, Fo Shan is turned into a ghetto. Ip Man, married with a young son, is relegated to shovelling coal amongst his former students in order to make ends meet. The Japanese General Miura (Hiroyuki Ikeuchi) in charge of the local occupying force, tasks Li Zhao (Ka Tung Lam), a former cop-turned-translator, to find willing martial-artists to face-off against an assembled troop of Japanese karate fighters in return for a bag of rice if the Chinese fighter wins their bout. After the disappearance of one of his friends after one of these matches, Ip Man steps into the ring and challenges 10 of the generals' Japanese fighters at once. The fight is stunning - and Ip Man emerges victorious. This leaves General Miura with a longing to fight the elusive and highly skilled Chinese opponent. He nudges his uninhibited and violent lieutenant to find Ip Man amongst the streets of Fo Shan in the guise that the general wants to enlist the astounding Chinese martial artist to teach the Japanese fighters the Wing Chun technique. Ip Man, having already been given this option after his victory over the 10 Japanese opponents, refuses and goes into hiding, feeling that the Japanese do not have the proper philisophical underpinning in order to absorb the teachings of his martial artistry.<br /><br />Meanwhile, Ip Man's industrious friend, Zhou Qing Quan (Simon Lam), having maintained his cotton mill after the occupation, has been threatened by the northern fighter, Jin Shanzhao, who has ammassed a crew of renegades to try to extract protection money or product from business owners in Fo Shan. Man comes to Quan's aid, and trains his friend's employees to defend themselves for the next visit. When the northerners return, Quan's people are ready - and are backed by Ip Man, who uses a long pole with exceptional skill to ensure that their invaders will never return. This showdown, however, leads to the Japanese learning of Ip Man's wherabouts. With Quan being threatened if he doesn't give up the location of his friend, Ip Man comes forward, surrenduring to the Japanese.<br /><br />The finale is epic - a fight between Ip Man, using Wing Chun, and General Miura, using karate. Fought upon a square stage in the town center, with an audience of Chinese held back at gunpoint by the Japanese occupying army, the anticipation pays off. The chance for Ip Man to give a glimmer of hope to his fellow countrymen has arrived, but it is also a deadly reckoning, as Miura's lieutenant expresses a threat of death to Ip Man should he defeat the general. An amazing instance of fight choreography is displayed. Hiroyuki Ikeuchi had never been trained in any martial artistry before this film, you would never know it...This, combined with Yen's utter mastery of Wing Chun lines this up as one of the most memorable fight scenes ever filmed.<br /><br />Of particular note is the amazing cast and direction. Fluid camerawork, dramatic musical score and an inspired lighting perspective are evident throughout. If you are a fan of Johnny To's Election, Mission, and Triad Election you will see that a number of actors from these excellent films are featured here in Ip Man.<br /><br />This film delivers on many levels:<br /><br />- a biopic historical interpretation of the rise of Wing Chun, one of the world's most popular martial arts disciplines (Bruce Lee's mentor was Ip Man)<br />- a fantastic action film with action sequences directed by the legenday Sammo Hung<br />- an alternative, micro-perspective of the historical drama of the 1930's Japanese occupation of China<br /><br />If you enoyed Hero, Fearless, Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon then you'll like this.he general.

B0021L8V0M|3.0|\\"Salt\\" is a film that was bashed by film critics, because it's an action film. Once again however, this action film is not as bad as the critics say it is.    The basic plot for \\"Salt\\" is focused on character Evelyn Salt (Angelina Jolie) who is a CIA agent. One day while interrogating a Russian defector, he tells her that a person by the name of Salt is going to assassinate the Russian president. In hearing this, the CIA decides to keep Salt in the interrogation room, to ask her some questions. She decides to run away which begs the question, is she a spy?    Angelina Jolie is the kind of actor where if she has a good script to follow like \\"Changeling\\" directed by Clint Eastwood, she is very good. \\"Salt\\" has a good plot, in which Angelina shines.
0385732554|4.0|This was assigned to my kids for summer reading. They read it, begrudgingly, but liked it. Like many books, it didn't immediately draw me into the story. I had to work for the first couple of chapters to really care and I never felt invested in the characters throughout the book (the only reason I gave it 4 stars). The plot, though, was captivating. It unfolded at a nice pace. The ending was not expected (which I love) but was very warm and gratifying. It left an impression on me that lasted for days. Well done.

0061714372|5.0|The tone of this tome is accessable by a wide audience from a wide diversity of backgrounds. Whether you are a Droog from way back and are taking your kids to see Megadeth, or you are a young Droog who is discovering Megadeth for the first time, this book is easy to sink your teeth into. It is written in a tone that is informative yet that keeps interest active, and it doesnt come off as many Rock n Roll diaries do -- with a \\"look how far I fell from grace, waking up in my own feces\\" like most of them out there. Of course, as some have said, it may not cover the darkest chapters of Dave's life nor of particular experiences that are discussed, but then one comes to realize that those experiences really only hold value from a reflective point of view. One can tell the same story from a postive perspective, or from a negative perspective. The story still remains in tact.<br /><br />Dont get me wrong. There are plenty of shocking and horrific accounts of the darker sins of Dave's past, if you will. However, Dave chooses not to make them the primary focus, lending it more to a captivating narrative rather than a train wreck full of blood, feces, and infected sores. If you want that, read Nikki Six's book (a great book by the way).<br /><br />This tome is long over due, and tells a very good story of how Megadeth came to be the International giant they are, and what fueled this beast, and how it lended Power to the idea that you can be on top of your game dispite the odds against you -- even when you placed those odds before your own feet by your own hands.<br /><br />A smooth read. An entertaining read. Having met Dave and crew many times during my days as a street team leader and as someone who worked with the various labels in marking campaigns that affected Megadeth (and others), this book has made me an even bigger fan than I was, becuase it taps into the human side of the Machine.

0525951652|5.0|Fall Of Giants is another mammoth-size work of historical fiction from Ken Follett that you won't want to put down once you start reading it. I got so caught up in this 985 page advance reader copy that I finished it in about a week, which is super fast for me. Fall Of Giants, the first book in The Century Trilogy, follows the lives of five interrelated families as they move through the events of WWI, the Russian Revolution and the women's suffrage movement. Follett's characters are so richly developed and his narrative abilities are so strong that I felt that I was right along side each of these families as they moved through the major events in their lives. I highly recommend Fall Of Giants to you so that you can enjoy traveling with Follett's characters as they move from Washington to St. Petersburg, from the dirt and danger of a coal mine to the glittering palaces of the super wealthy, to the corridors of power and to the bedrooms of the mighty. Do yourself a favor and be one of the first on line to get yourself a copy of this very entertaining, well-researched and memorable book. But be aware that your enjoyment won't come cheap -- the retail price of Fall Of Giants is $36. I think you'll find, however, that it is worth every penny.

Brought my little sister to even see it, because we have the same taste in movies.
B002ZG9846|4.0|Much better than the last Mark Millar comic to film adaptation, namely Wanted, Kick-Ass is a gleefully ultraviolent blast.  Aaron Johnson stars as Dave, a teenage loser whose obsession with comic books leads him to donning a ridiculous costume, calling himself Kick-Ass, and fighting crime.  Things don't go so well for him naturally in the process as he winds up getting his you know what handed to him, and eventually comes across masked vigilantes Big Daddy (Nicolas Cage) and daughter Hit Girl (Chloe Moretz) who are targeting gangster Frank D'Amico (Mark Strong) whose own son (Superbad's Christopher Mintz-Plasse) decides to don a costume and call himself Red Mist.  Directed by Layer Cake helmer Matthew Vaughn (who at one time was set to helm the third X-Men film, and is no preparing an X-Men prequel), Kick-Ass is filled with fun, ridiculous violence and action, but sadly manages to lose steam after its first half.  The cast is great (Cage in particular has great fun doing an Adam West impersonation) all around, but even they can't save the fact that by the time Kick-Ass wraps up, it's become the kind of comic film that it pokes fun at in the first place.  Not to mention the fact that so much of the little things that made the comic and its characters so interesting (namely the real \\"secret\\" origin of Big Daddy and Hit Girl in the comic) is nowhere to be found, as are most of the darkly comedic moments and are replaced by more or less happier turnouts.  Despite how much the film adaptation of Kick-Ass has been streamlined from the comic though, the film is still plenty fun and enjoyable, and the fact that it didn't undergo a complete overhaul like the film adaptation of Wanted is reason enough to praise it alone.

0446402397|4.0|The serial killer story line has worn kind of thin as of late.  No need to retread old ground unless there is something new to give it new blood.  CHILD 44 fills that requirement, placing the story deep inside 1953 Stalinist Russia, where a child killer needs almost nothing to keep the authorities off his trail.  As such a man is ideologically not supposed to exist in the worker's paradise, the authorities simply treat him as if he really does not.  His crimes, spread over the Eastern part of Russia, are not tied together as the work of one man, but are instead blamed on others, vagrants, the psychologically troubled, who are also inconvenient to the Soviet propaganda machine.    The criminal side to the story, however, is rather weak.  The `twist' ending is not only ludicrous, but easily foreseeable given the prologue to the main action.  The author did not throw in those few pages of two boys from twenty years earlier for nothing.   Further, the assumptions that the killer makes as to who would pick up his scent are, to say the least, rather loose.  These weaknesses are all the worse given that CHILD 44 would have worked just as well, indeed better, without those strings necessary to sustain the twist.      What saves the book, big time, is the author's excellent portrayal of the political atmosphere under Stalin, as well as the State Security Force officer, Leo Demidov, whose life until this point was a model of the new Soviet man.  The first 100 pages or so of CHILD 44 is used almost exclusively to create the feeling of paranoia and blatant fear experienced by everyday men and women in this regime, where any statement, no matter how small or unintentional, could lead literally to torture and death.  Demidov is part of that machine, performs his duties with expertise and enthusiasm, and nonetheless sleeps well at night knowing he is doing his part to advance the socialist cause.    It all comes apart.  After putting the pieces together, Demidov realizes that he himself has become an enemy of the state for pursuing the killer.  The killer's existence is inconvenient to begin with, and doubly so as innocent men have already been executed for the crimes.  Admitting the killer is real is tantamount to admitting that the glorious state has made mistakes.  As his life comes apart due to his loss in status, Demidov realizes just how much of that life - his wife, his parents, his privileged status - was constructed on a false foundation that crumbles in an instant as soon as one starts inspecting the ideological underpinnings.      Well written with an interesting setting, CHILD 44 will suck in many readers who give it a go.  Let  us hope the author keeps his momentum going for future installments.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|LOVE phantom of the opera. all time favorite broadway musical and love it just as much on dvd
B00095NX9G|5.0|I have a whole library of bellydance dvds and this is by far one of the best.  Rachel's instructions are very clear, the camera is focused on where it should be, and the pace is fast enough so that you are not bored but slow enough that you don't feel like you're doing \\"speed yoga\\" or are trying to learn a choreography in 4 minutes or less.  As others have mentioned, the choreographies are probably not going to work well for someone who hasn't ever taken a lesson.  If you are totally new to bellydance I would still recommend buying this set, just because disk 1  will prepare your body to dance well and you'll gain flexibility you never knew you had.  Still, for a total beginner (or someone whose only instruction has come from videos) I would recommend taking a good class to learn proper technique, posture, and basic dance terms before doing disk 2.  A good instructor will be able to watch what you are doing, keep you from injuring yourself, and I really do think that disk 2 will be very frustrating for someone who has never taken a class.  And HOORAY for the backbending instruction!  I have not found many instructors in my area who want to teach laybacks and such, and this is a very informative section that I will be watching over and over again.<br /><br />Like one other reviewer I'm not really fond of the music chosen for the 1st choreography.  This is not necessarily a bad thing.  Any dancer who hopes to someday be part of a dance troupe will probably have to do a dance that they don't like or dance to a song they don't care for, so just because I don't really like the music doesn't mean that I will not bother to learn it.  Sometimes learning to dance to a song has caused me to learn to like it just because it becomes familiar and I'm having FUN!<br /><br />The only problem I had with the yoga/exercise portions of this video are that the instructions flip-flop.  At the beginning, when she is facing you, the voiceover will say something like \\"move your right arm....\\" and she moves her left so she is mirroring you.  Further on into the workout the voicover will say to move your right arm/leg ands she actually uses her right arm/leg and therefore you will have to either do the opposite of what she is saying if you want to mirror her movements, or actually go the way she says which will NOT mirror her movements.  I think they could have done a LOT better with the voiceover as far as that goes.  It is confusing to most people to hear \\"move left\\" and see someone move to their right, especially when the instruction starts out so well.  Other than that this is a great dvd.moves her left so she is mirroring you.

030745455X|4.0|'The Girl who Played with Fire' is based solely on the back story of Lisabeth Salander who became a main character in the first novel.  A series of murder's takes place, and evidence at the crime scenes suggests that Salander is the main suspect.  Salander who is hiding out and hesitant to trust anyone, and her friends, the closest being the journalist Blomkvist, must use their personal investigating skills to put the pieces of the mystery together and locate the true villains.<br /><br />The plot in this book is a whole lot less involved than the first, which was one of my main complaints.  This one focuses on the interesting characters who I enjoyed so much during the first.  Salander is by far the most interesting, and the story dissects her past traumas and elusive family, and creates an elaborate description and rationale for her being and acting the way she does.  Her cunning actions and computer savvy abilities make the story all the more interesting as it jumps back and forth between all the characters who are searching for Salander and the answers to the murder mystery.  It is lengthy, but worth it this time. Too bad you have to get through the first one to enjoy the series.

1439153663|5.0|From the beginning of the first page to the very last page of The Kitchen House, I couldn't put the book down. With her first novel author Kathleen Grissom has written a fantastic book  about slavery and how they were treated back in the late 1700's early 1800's. As we view the  happenings  through the eyes of the main characters Lavinia, the orphaned  seven year old from Ireland who knows no skin color  shows love and loyalty  to the only family she knows  and Belle, the illegitimate daughter of the Master who takes Lavinia under her wing along with Mama Mae and Papa George..As we go through the growing up years with Lavinia we witness the treatment of the slaves, the death of the master and the cruelty of the masters own son Marshall who plays a big part throughout the novel and  brings the reader into the injustice of the slaves by their  owners in that time era. From the use of opium to  rape and murder, makes this a fantastic and all inspiring novel.<br /><br />From the cover of the book that entices  and tempts the reader to pick it up  and see what lies between the  covers, to the well defined characters and overall theme  of the book, the  realistic dialogue to the  amazing plot of the story I feel this book has the appeal and  potential to reach many readers. A very enjoyable  and fantastic read.  I recommend this book to everyone that  and especially those  who enjoy historical fiction of that  era. I would love to see a sequel of this book to follow the lives of the childen  both from the slaves and Lavinia as they grown up and  go on with their lives.

It's like watching the sun set, the way the genre starts out light and funny and slowly gives way to night.
B002JCSWV6|2.0|The story of how Nelson Mandela, after becoming the leader of South Africa following the demise of the apartheid regime, tried to heal the racially divided country by, among other things, supporting the Springboks, the South African rugby team, who were supported by the white minority and hated by blacks, during the 1995 World Cup (the Springboks managed to win). Matt Damon does a nice turn as Francois Pienaar, the captain of the Springbooks, who coming like the rest of his teammates from an Afrikaner home hostile to the new regime slowly warms up to Mandela. Morgan Freeman is almost insufferable as the new president, showing him almost as a holy fool, a naïve, always smiling, quasi imbecile. The real Mandela, who was (for a good cause) the leader of Africa's main armed faction for more than thirty years, is probably made of sterner stuff. You don't have to be a cynic to find this movie trite and corny, full of cringing dialogue that is almost painful to listen. Even the rugby scenes shown here are uninspiring. A disappointment.

B003ASLJS6|4.0|My wife and I have been watching a lot of Clint Eastwood western movie DVDs as a form of late night entertainment. We enjoy them very much. Last night we watched \\"Pale Rider.\\" Here Eastwood played a White Night on a beautiful horse to a group of gold-pan miners who were in danger of having their claims stolen by a rival gold company. Of course, there was a lot of violence, first without guns and second with as matters escalated. Eastward played an unconvincing role as a traveling preacher. Sorry, it just didn't fit. In any case, he dispatched the bad guys, as you would expect and a lot of people met their maker Eastwood style.<br /><br />It was an interesting movie. Supposedly, it happened in the gold country of California but a lot looked like it was filmed in the Grand Tetons and the scenery was astonishingly beautiful. The story and the acting, well it was so, so. Somehow, \\"Pale Rider\\" didn't rise to the level of the other Eastwood western movies, but it was still excellent entertainment and well worth viewing.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B003ES5JDS|5.0|Let's see; A healthy dose of a murderous madman;  The discovery of a former partners `return from the dead; A dark hero struggling to justify the path he chose after losing his parents.........this is one whale of a Dark Knight Tale brought to us by the animating team at DC comics!      Of all the Batman stories Bruce Timm, Inc. could have brought to DVD, `Under the Red Hood' represents a full arc of intrigue, action and emotion which makes DC characters so unique in the world of comics.      The animators and writers seemingly jumped into a Lazarus pit of opportunity to take you into the madness and pain of Jason Todd - the Robin stripped from Batman's side by the Joker's hand. One also gains a better perspective of Dick Grayson's respect for his former mentor, while we better understand why Batman's code of ethics is so resolute.     All this emotional story telling is teamed with action and violence befitting a story based in Gotham City. The PG-13 rating is a good measure, but that said, the violence depicted was far from gratuitous and merely served as a means of better understanding the characters in the story.      ........Simply an amazing story - \\"Under the Red Hood\\" stands tall, arguably taller than any other animated DVD Warner. Bros. have released.  However September has the promise of another great DVD as Michael Turner and Jeph Loeb's Supergirl story arc will be brought to animation; looking forward to it!
0143038419|3.0|I can't add much to the other negative reviews. I think these adjectives pretty much do the trick: self-absorbed, self-congratulatory, self-involved, narcissistic, new-age fluff. There were some interesting passages in regards to the culture and religious swayings of India and Bali, which pushed my review from one star to 3 (would have been 2 1/2 if I was allowed, but since I'm in a generous mood today, I'll round up). If you must read it, it's definitely one to borrow or take out from the library.
