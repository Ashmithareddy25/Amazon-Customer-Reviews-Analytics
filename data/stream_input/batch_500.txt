0440224764|1.0|This was the first JG novel I have ever read and it will be the last. I echo everything Chris from ABQ said below. The book did start reasonably okay, but the ending is ridiculous. And yes it could have easily been 250 pages shorter. In fact probably the only enjoyable thing was Lanigan getting electrodes attached to his nuts and systematically tortured. Avoid.
B000065V3H|5.0|Can't Buy Me Love was on TV last night. Of course, I had to watch it AGAIN. My boyfriend has never seen it, so we watched it together. It's sooo great seeing Patrick Dempsey getting some recongnition finally!(In Grey's Anatomy) I loved him in this movie. When this movie first came out, my best friend and I would watch it all the time and wish we were Amanda Peterson. It brought back so many great memories last night. The 80's clothes and hair-everything. I love this movie and I hope everyone that watches it, enjoys it too. Well, GOTTA BOLT! :D
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Summary: <br />Octavarium is about music and not musicianship.  As with all great bands that have been around a long time (DT has been around for 15+ years!), there is a natural progression in musical style.  This album as with all other albums is musically unique and stands out as its own character.  Musically this album probably deserves 5 stars, but considering all the ingredients that make up a commerical release some weaknesses with the sound mixing, lyrics and (on a personal note) Petrucci's relative absence are prompting me go with 4. <br /> <br />Key points and highlights of Octavarium: <br /> - James Labrie <br /> - Some mainstream (U2, Cold Play etc.) elements <br /> - Melody is driven by vocals and keyboard <br /> - Overall album theme: Shadowy, Operatic, Emotional <br /> - Octavarium (title track) - a celebration of the ocean that is music and the saga that this progressive rock <br /> - Several cool nuggets and thematic connections (visit the DT message board if interested) <br /> <br />DT Fan Advisory: <br />  No rippers from Petrucci and Portnoy is very much subdued <br />  DT will never release another I&W, Awake or SFAM <br />  Give this one a few listens - sincere recommendation from one DT fan to another <br /> <br />Personal influence:  10+ listens already ... I probably haven't listened to anything else in the last 24 hours.  Certain melodies, I find are haunting and deeply moving.  I'm hooked already and probably will be for a while.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I've never been ultra fond of anything written by Coldplay.  I enjoyed a few songs here and there but none others ever really caught my attention and to be quite frank, I found them quite boring.  I've only bought X&Y a few hours ago and have already listened to it back and forth at least 5 times and every song has already become recognizable and memorable to the extent to which I can sing along (or atleast attempt to).  Bottom line is, while many fans of the previous two albums might express their grief and dissappointment with this album, open-minded fans and new-comers alike will find something on this album to truly enjoy.
B0002DB0FO|5.0|Very good family programing with great writing and acting, each episode is filled with beautiful lighting and filming.  WHAT a location!  Great to watch with your kids. <br /> <br />
0440237688|5.0|\\"THE GIVER\\" is the story of 12-year-old Jonas (no last name) a boy who lives in a world where everything is controlled. There are thousands of strict rules to follow, and everything is chosen by a select Council of Elders. This includes jobs, marital partners, children, etc. There is no color, no emotion, no diversity.  <br />  The story is good from the beginning, but really picks up at the Ceremony of Twelve, where children who turn twelve that year get jobs chosen for them by the Council and go into training. Other kids get jobs like Engineer and Laborer, Jonas gets specially selected to be the Reciever of Memory. <br />  On his first day of training, Jonas meets the Giver, a kind old man that transmits memories of past generations into Jonas, so he can gain wisdom. There are happy memories, such as sailing on a lake, and going downhill on a sled, but there are sad and horrible memories, like poverty, war, and physical pain.  <br />  I won't go into much detail from there, because I've told you too much already, but I will say this gets thumbs up from me. Highly recommended.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This DVD set of the Star Wars Trilogy is absolutely fascinating!! <br />I like all of the Star Wars films and they are Special Editions of the movies just like the VHS tapes.  These are better on DVD!! <br />If you're a big fan of Star Wars, you'll love this DVD set!!  It's fantastic!!
B00005V0X5|3.0|Credit must be given to Dave Mustaine for wanting this headbanging record to sound good. The sound is loud and crunchy and the drums are absolutely ear-kicking... The removal of the reverb gives the album a completely different ambiance (the process was not as successful on \\"So Far, So Good...\\"). The new cover is actually quite interesting even if it doesn't freak me out as much as the original. <br />Now to the bad part... I know it's been said before, but this reissue is completely ruined by the BEEEEEPs on \\"These Boots\\". <br />I'd recomend both versions of this album. For the original one look for the edition with \\"These Boots\\" UNCENSORED. It's definitely a must get.
B00097A5HW|5.0|This CD is amazing! This CD it's the best Shakira album after Donde Estan Los Ladrones? but of course, it's not the typical Shakira album, this one is , as she said, her most echlectical album. The album stars with 'En tus pupilas' a beautiful ballad that stars with Shakira singing in frech, the guitars sound like Chriss Isaak's 'Wicked Game' or Shakira's 'Sombra De Ti' and in the chorus she resembles a little bit to Mexican singer/composer Julieta Venegas. The next one 'La Pared' a strong and electronic song that you can see it like the spanish version of Coldplay's \\"Clocks\\" but still it's completely different in lyrics and Shakira's singin. \\"La Tortura\\" seems to be out of place in this album. \\"Obtener Un Si\\" sounds like those songs from the early 50's and it's a great bossa nova beat. \\"Dia Especial\\" a good song and the first one Shakira doesn't wrote. The music is made by Shakira but the lyrics it's from the legend of spanish rock, Gustavo Cerati. \\"Escondite Ingles\\" the strongest song in the album, it's very charmed and punk. \\"No\\" a sad but great ballad with Cerati's accompaining her on the guitars and some vocals. This one wil be the next single out of Fijacion Oral. \\"Las De La Intuicion\\", this one is the pop song on the album, it has a brit eltectronic pop beat in it, and an incredible catchy chorus. \\"Dia De Enero\\" the song that Shakira wrote for his boyfriend Antonio De La Rua, Shakira sounds funny and girlish on this one, and the chorus it's full of romaticism and feeling. \\"Lo Imprescindible\\" it's very dark at the beginning, starting with Shakira's singing in German, then the song become lighter but still strong on the chorus. The acoustic version of \\"La Pared\\" seems to be better than the original one, it's very simple and Shakira's vocal are great. And last but not least, it's \\"La tortura\\" Shaketon remix, this one it's darker than the original, still great but not better than the original one. Shakira has done an excellent album, a more mature work, fresh andone that will be remembered very well for everyone. <br />
B00005JMFQ|5.0|I was checking down the list and saw most people like the Movie and did'nt take it to serious, Then i read the review from MOTHER HEN who said there was incomprehensible scenes... THIS IS A MOVIE- NOT REAL LIFE, instead of Picking at every scene Why did'nt you jump Click STOP and that would been the End of it..But you hated the film that much, You watch it til the End Why??? Just like Josephll \\"Josephll All he/she did was complain about the movie, WHY did they sit through Whole film If it was that bad??? Then Both leave a Huge Feedback about it?? If i hate a Film i would stay away from It..Not waste my good time writing a review on it.??   If you ain't seen It Yet.. Well go and see It and See this Movie, because end of the day it a MOVIE NOT REAL LIFE...
B00097A5I6|1.0|I have always thought this band sucked, and this album proves it. They've ripped off everyone here, especially '60s Brit bands. No originality. No talent.
B0001YRVN4|5.0|I love Star Wars, and I always have.  It's the original sci-fi saga.  You can't even compare it with Star Trek because it's so much better.  I'm sorry, maybe I'm a little biased.  But Star Wars has, is, and always will be my favorite science fiction series. <br /> <br />It's not just the fact that the acting is superb, the plot is riveting, and the settings are realistic (despite that the movies were produced in the 70s [i think? - i wasn't around back then]).  Somehow, the trilogy is understandable and easy to relate to (unlike Lord of the Rings, for instance).  You fall in love with the characters in Episode IV, and that's what holds your attention more than anything else for the rest of the trilogy. <br /> <br />Some might suggest that you watch Episodes I-III first, before you get to these.  I suppose you could do that, but I maintain that you don't need to.  These movies were made to stand alone, and they have.  You don't need to watch episodes I-III before you get to these.  In fact, I am of the opinion that you should watch the older movies first, because I think that the first three episodes are far more confusing.  It would be easier to understand if you've already seen the originals. <br /> <br />Regarding plot, it is a bit confusing, but not too badly.  First, the emperor aand Darth Vader have pretty much taken over the Universe and destroyed all thats left of the Jedi (except for Obi-Wan and Yoda).  To go into that, the Jedi use the Force for good and the Dark Side use it for bad.  Thus, the classic theme of good v. evil emerges.  Anyway, two droids land on a planet and meet up with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill).  There's a message from a damsel in distress on one of the droids, and Luke takes the droid to Obi-Wan, who lives nearby.  Returning home, Luke finds his aunt and uncle dead, killed by imperial troops.  He then decides to join Obi-Wan in his mission to help the Princess Lea, who has been captured by Darth Vader.  From there, the plot is obvious.Luke joins up with Han Solo (Harrison Ford) to help the rebels (another facet of the good side fighting against the Empire).  And the story goes on from there, until predictably, the Empire is defeated. <br /> <br />Of course, there's a lot of drama and action and revealed information in between.  That's what makes it good. <br /> <br />I love all the characters in Star Wars.  My favorite, I must admit, is Han Solo.  He's just that cool.  Luke's character is also well done, as is basically everyone else's.  The director even takes the time to develop the droid's and Chewbacca's personas.  The character development is what makes this movie great. <br /> <br />Action scenes are superb for the time these movie were made.  Special effects are amazing and seem real despite the fact that most aliens are people in costumes.  Whereas the new Star Wars movies rely almost totally on digital animation (the biggest problem i have with the new movies), the old ones rely on acting and just plain, good old-fashioned costumes. <br /> <br />I won't even get into the new movies here.  The old ones are SO MUCH BETTER!!  I LOVE THE OLD STAR WARS MOVIES!  The new ones were decent, I suppose, but they could have been so much better.  The acting was mediocre, and although special effects were good, i think that they should have modelled the new ones after these three originals.  After all, you can never top the original, but you can at least try to imitate it!
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I have been a DT fan for quite some time now, so my review may be slightly biased.  Octavarium is an excellent CD for a veteran DT fan, as well as the 16 year old who is just discovering them.  As with all DT efforts, the musicianship is unrivaled.  Lets face it, Dream Theater is a musician's band.  Moving on......This album places a heavy emphasis on the melody.  After listening to the songs a few times, you will more than likely be humming the tune.  Track 4, \\"I Walk Beside You\\" is very U2, as far as the guitar work and soaring melody.  Track 3, \\"These Walls,\\" flat out rocks, regardless on the clean guitar/distorion contrast.  The title track, \\"Octavarium\\" is great if you have a spare 24 mins to listen to it.  I think it would have been more practical to break it up into different tracks as with 6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence.....Next..... <br />Fans who love Train of Thought will find that this album is very different.  Just as good or better depending on your taste, but just not as heavy.  Train of thought is a metal monster.  This is a more well rounded group of songs, or should I say Octad :-) .... To sum it up, if you're into great melodies, buy this record.  If you're into difficult instrumental thrashing, buy this CD.  If you like neither of the above, buy it anyway.  Also, you could always listen to the song clips online and form your own damn opinions rather then reading what other people think!!!!
B0009I7NNA|5.0|If you are pissed Shadow doesn't scream anymore, too bad.  In the words of Justin Timberlake, \\"Cry me a river.\\"  Avenged Sevenfold's Warner debut is a fresh start for these guys to showcase everything they are made of.  Screaming didn't make this band; it's the band as a whole and their love for music.  City Of Evil shows another side of A7X; a side that a lot of people have been waiting for. <br /> <br />What comes to mind when you take a listen to the guys' new album?  How about Guns N Roses, Iron Maiden, and a bit of Pantera.  Now doesn't that sound like something you want to listen to?  Avenged Sevenfold draw from all those influences and create their own masterpiece to put onto the wall of metal.  This album is chalk full of epic songs that will leave a metal head baffled.  Just take a listen to \\"Strength Of The World\\" and you'll hear why.  They even pulled out the violins at the end of the song. <br /> <br />The guys took a huge gamble in making this album, but in the end it paid off.  City Of Evil is going to be the album you hate to love.  For an album that lasts over an hour, you will find yourself spending quite a bit of your time listening over and over.
B0006L16N8|3.0|There was something about \\"Rush\\" that made their music like a fine wine. Each piano note was beautiful, each lyric was real, each musician had the perfect imput, and it went somewhere.    I see X&Y as a totally different story. Coldplay want to be the new \\"U2\\", that is obvious from the music.But it doesn't feel as natural as the first time. It is as if Chris Martin selected everything which had made Coldplay popular:   catchy tunes eg: Yellow, in my place  and melodic arrangements eg: clocks, trouble  beautiful ballads see- Scientist  deep lyrics - Politik, in my place,    and put them all in one basket. The result \\"X and Y\\".But while you are sure to get what you expect, what's missing is the genuine feeling that was there the first time.It seems that this music is more commercial rather than artistic. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. I am sure that in terms of their career, the band is taking the right direction, to become the new \\"u2\\".    However, there is one problem. The \\"fine wine\\" I was referring to before has turned into a massive market selling label.The appeal it first had when you didn't know of its full potential has become worldwide. You will still drink it no doubt, but you won't enjoy it the same way you did the frist time.
B00000DRXM|5.0|ok first of all i would like to say what a great album this is (from the awesome guitar solos to crazy train, which is a great song), but   i'm not here to talk about how good it is just buy iti am hear because last night i was reading a review of back in black (another great album i would recommend it to anyone) and i read a review by some idiot who said that the only reason every1 likes ac/dc is because of some band named \\"jet\\", and i was confused because i have never heard of \\"jet\\", and i was also confused because mtv certainly does not rock, it sucks more than anything else.  then today i decided i would read some more of his reviews and i discovered he was even more of and idiot. then i got to his review of blizzard of ozz. if you dont know who ozzy  osbourne is first of all you might as well just die but then to go on and say bad things about him should be punished by more than death. then to go on and say that it is \\"poser junk\\"... dude ozzy invented heavy metal how the heck can u call him a poser u idiot! then you go on and call randy rhoades (one of the greatest guitar players ever) to be to lazy to play the guitar anymore, im sure if someone put a guitar in his grave he would be happy to play it for you so you can see how great of a guitarist he is. yeah thats right hes dead u idiot.  <br />\\"I lost a ton of respect for this guy when I found out Ozzy had been a member of fake metal bands.\\"  do you even know anything about black sabbath? cause they freaking invented heavy metal you idiot. and as my closing comments nobody listen to this idiot he has no idea what he is talking about, go ahead and buy this cd it is great!
B000006045|5.0|I picked this up in 1998, in Ottawa, on a blind whim. I didn't know what \\"trip-hop\\" was, who Massive Attack was, or what the album was going to sound like (I just thought the cover was cool). I popped in into my rental-car stereo -- and was totally blown away. I drove around aimlessly for two hours so I could keep listening. <br />  Seven years later, Mezzanine's still near the top of my 500-album stack, in heavy rotation. <br />  This album crosses dozens of genre lines but doesn't bow to any of them. Somehow, M.A. managed to synthesize something completely new out of borrowed pieces of hip-hop, classical, anthem rock, metal, industrial and its own pre-Mezzanine sound. I'm waiting for another group of artists to achieve something even remotely as imaginative and ahead of its time as Mezzanine. <br />   Even if the Bristol sound isn't your thing, you have to appreciate Mezzanine as a creative stroke of genius. If you like music at all, you'll be well rewarded for giving it a listen.
0792839730|4.0|Very good adaption of the Ryan book, which stays about as true to the epic narrative as is probably possible. I've seen others remark that the score to the movie sometimes is out of place, and I would agree, but it's still one of my favorite movie scores, and is quite rousing.    I'm generally not a fan of the 'big name star stew' casting, but it works, for the most part, in this movie. Bogarde and Hackman are especially good. One of my pet peeves in war movies is obvious anachronism. It appears here in the use of modern vehicles in place of period German tanks. I can excuse this, since this movie didn't have the boundless budget of, say, Saving Private Ryan. They did at least use Shermans for the Allies. Overall, the movie is entertaining, and reasonably true to the book/historical events.    The dvd itself, however, is nothing special. The picture isn't horrible, but it's a little grainy, and you get pretty frequent flashes of scarred film. The movie would probably need a serious revamping, a la 'Vertigo' or 'Rear Window' to substantially improve this, though, so this is likely the best we'll get.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I don't get the \\"dissapointment trend\\" going on. This album is very good and Coldplay didn't dissapoint at all. Yes they are everywhere on the media right now and yes everyone is talking about them but this doesn't bother them because they are great musicians and they know how to construct a challenging and also relaxing album. Don't waste another minute and BUY THIS !
B0006L16N8|2.0|I am a big Coldplay fan, but I must say that X&Y doesn't approach the first two albums. If you want a Coldplay album, start with either album before X&Y--Parachutes or Rush of Blood to the Head.  <br /> <br />X&Y does show glimpses of the former greatness, but overall it's a bland and uninspired offering from this talented group. Chris Martin already said this was their last album, so maybe they know they've run out of ideas.
B0009AM5JA|4.0|The above quote taken from a Pitchfork review, which for the first time in a long long time hit the nail right on the head for me.<br /><br />I have to say that compared to the disaster that was A Rush Of Blood To The Head, this is a huge step forward in their sound as a band (although Chris is very often drowned out by everyone else). They captured a little bit of that live sound that is the only reason I became interested in Coldplay. That's all that keeps me from giving this album 3 stars.<br /><br />The album starts off strong, with Will showing off some not-so-basic drumming skillz. Finally a little variety in his style. Standout tracks on this album are 'Square One', 'White Shadows', 'Low', and 'Twisted Logic'. The latter, I feel, is Coldplay's best and most promising song ever. It is one of the few songs on X&Y that goes in a different direction (albeit, slightly Radiohead-esque) without sounding like they're ripping anyone off too hard.<br /><br />The complaints I have about this album are that the songs too often come off as uninspired. The biggest \\"WTF??\\" that was drawn from me came from the first single, 'Speed of Sound'. In a way it's what 'Clocks' should have been, but since it wasn't, there really is no reason for such a blatant recycling of music. Not a bad song, but the simple fact that 'Clocks' came first really takes all the credibility away for me.<br /><br />Coldplay are showing off their influences more than ever on this album. 'Talk', which samples Kraftwerk's 'Computer Love', came off to me as annoying on first listen, just because I was all \\"Hey, it's Kraftwerk.\\" 'Fix You' is not sampling anything, though I found it is very heavy on the Sigur Ros-itude. Comparing it to Sigur Ros leaves a lot to be desired; on its own, 'Fix You' is a good song.<br /><br />The good points of this album seem to reside heavily on the \\"X\\" side of the album, while \\"Y\\" is very stagnant sounding. It's like the pressure of EMI finally caught up to them and they just quickly wrote some generic Coldplay stuff. So this record gets props for being a step forward for Coldplay, even if it is a very small and hesitant step.<br /><br />X&Y also gets props for the most niftiest of trendy silicone wristbands it came with.f. So this record gets props for being a step forward for Coldplay, even if it is a very small and hesitant step.    X&Y also gets props for the most niftiest of trendy silicone wristbands it came with.
0312323859|5.0|The first book I read was \\"Something Borrowed\\" where you rooted for Rachel,the nice, plain girl to win her gorgeous best friend Darcy's fiance away and this book is an amazing sequel! <br />This book gives you the \\"other side\\" of the story-from the gorgeous friend's viewpoint.   <br />The books tie in so well together, whereas I giggled and rooted for the \\"underdog\\" in the first book, I got teary eyed as I read how the self centred Darcy comes to realize that there is more to the world than just her. <br />Definately worth the time and money to try Emily Giffin's \\"Something...\\" books-you won't be disappointed! <br />
B00006L3LD|4.0|As many have said, the DVD content is pretty limited. Tour videos, a music video, and an abundantly useless discography. It speaks of online offers for a &quot;night time&quot; version of the 'Are You In?' video, but if you're like me and just got the album, the video is no longer available.<br />As for the music, this is probably what Make Yourself should've been. The sound has improved a bit, and Brandon no longer sounds drowned out by the band.<br />The best songs are '11 am', 'Just A Phase', 'Mexico', 'Under My Umbrella', and 'Aqueous Transmission'. 'Under My Umbrella' is a  nice fast pace sound, with an awesome bridge reminiscent of Porcupine Tree. 'Aqueous Transmission' mixes West with the East and is very effective. The only song I really have a problem with is 'Blood On The Ground'; it just isn't the greatest song ever, and the lyrics are pretty bad.<br />The best thing about this album is how Incubus tries to display as wide a range as can be managed in the nu-metal-esque genre (yes I know they are not nu-metal). There's dynamic changes, occasional variety in instrumentation, dissonance, and genre fusion (see Aqueous Transmission).<br />If you're into Incubus, this album gets my highest recommendation (second to A Crow Left Of The Murder).
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|The answer would be yes. This is System's best album to date, and the only possible flaw with it is that it is too short. But seeing as how that shall be remedied this fall with the second part, Hypnotize, that's not something to complain about too much. Many people complain about Daron getting too much vocal time. I have to admit, at first, I was put off by him. But after a few listens, I have come to see that there is no problem in that at all. Of course, we all know that it would have been better with more Serj, but it is still great the way it is, as Daron is a great singer in his own way. <br /> <br />1. Soldier Side (Intro) - By itself, no, this is not a great song. But seeing as it's meant as an intro, it is great. It is deceptive as well, as the next song is completely different from the calmness and softness of this one. As an intro, this is a good song. 8/10 <br /> <br />2. B.Y.O.B. - Starts off very fast, and then it suddenly slows down to R&B style for the chorus. A very strange thing to do, but good anyways. Both the verses and the chorus sound very good. It sounds really awesome when they say \\"Where the f*** are you?\\" and then they start saying \\"Why don't presidents fight the war? Why do they always send the poor?\\" The song during and after that part is amazing, and great to listen to. A very good song. 9/10 <br /> <br />3. Revenga - Starts off seeming like it will be slow, but the the guitars kick in. The verses are so fast it's almost impossible to tell what they're saying the first few times around. The verses are fast as hell and the chorus is slower, but amazing too, with incredible guitar riffs within it. The part where the music almost completely drops out, and it's Daron singing with Serj in harmony fits perfectly. A great song as well. 9/10 <br /> <br />4. Cigaro - The lyrics will definately take you off guard the first time around; this is a rather amusing song. The chorus is spectacular in this, with Serj and the guitar melding perfectly together. Daron's \\"Can't you see that I love my c***?\\" line and the two following it sound really great. A very funny, and very good, song. 9/10 <br /> <br />5. Radio/Video - This song would have been truly extraordinary if it weren't for the chorus. The chorus in here just bugs me to no end. The verses, on the other hand, are awesome. The only other annoying thing in here is later on, when Serj sings the chorus really softly, but then screams 'radio' and 'video'. That just really didn't need to be in there either. Don't get me wrong, though; I like this song, for the rest of it is really great. It just could have been better if those two things were taken out and replaced. Overall, a good song. 8/10 <br /> <br />6. This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song - The title alone should tell you that this will be an interesting song. This song makes practically no sense whatsoever, and has some of the most bizarre vocals from Serj to be heard yet, but it's still awesome. The \\"Gonorrhea, gorgonzola\\" part is really fun and amusing. If there is some type of message to be had in this song, I sure have no idea what it is, but it's a keeper regardless. 8/10 <br /> <br />7. Violent Pornography - This is one of my favorite songs on the album. Starts off slow, and then Serj and Daron come in. I love the \\"It's a non-stop disco, bet you it's Nabisco, bet you didn't know, whoo-hoo!\\" part. The chorus is amazing, even though there's really nothing all that special about it. I just love listening to it; it's probably the guitar and harmony. The second repeat of the chorus, around 2:20, is amazing. I really like the very end, where Serj stutters \\"brainwashing\\", and then Daron says \\"It's a non-stop disco\\" one last time. 10/10 <br /> <br />8. Question! - It's hard to describe this song... it's just extraordinary. The verses and chorus are both sung melodically, and the chorus sounds truly epic. The third repeat of the chorus just blows me away, with the guitar playing away incrediblyfast underneath it. You have to listen to this song to really understand why it is so great. 10/10 <br /> <br />9. Sad Statue - The verses are great and fast paced, especially the ones where Daron and Serj harmonize. The chorus is very unexpected, as it suddenly slows to about half as fast as it was. It sound good, though. The final repeat of the chorus is noticable. A good song. 8/10 <br /> <br />10. Old School Hollywood - This is a very different song, for System. It has a very techno-type feel for most of it, but that is by no means a bad thing. The guitar in this song is incredible beyond belief. The chorus is nice, but it's the guitar that is the true star in this song; it's amazing. Really the only downfall is that Daron sounds a little obnoxious during the verses, but the rest is too great to dislike it just for that reason. 10/10 <br /> <br />11. Lost In Hollywood - Completely different from the rest of the album, this song is disliked by many because Daron is the main singer. Well, that doesn't matter at all, as this is still a great song. It never gets hard or rough at all, it is sweet, melodic singing throughout. Serj sounds really nice in the background, and Daron sounds just fine at the front. The song is sad and tragic, but very heartfelt. The moaning throughout sounds wonderful. This is probably the best ending to an album System has had so far, and an amazing song in its own right. 10/10
B0006L16N8|5.0|I have to admit that I have not been a huge fan of Coldplay over the years.  I do like some of their past songs on an individual basis but not the full album.  There are not many bands that can put together a FULL album of songs that can be played over and over.  Most just have maybe 5 to 6 songs that acomplish that.  Having said that, I have crossed over to the world that is Coldplay with thier latest release X&Y.  I bought the album on a whim after sampling some songs and I have not taken it out of my cd player since.  In fact, I have not stopped talking about it to other fans.  Every song on this album is great and I find myself struggling to find a favorite.  You can really tell who inspires this album.  It is like Martin and the guys sat with Bono and the Edge to record some of this stuff.  What can I say it is an excellent album.
0786890754|1.0|It's taken me 2 weeks to get through 3 chapters when I normally finish a book on a weekend.  Very slow start, extremely repetitive about inane things, and, well....boring as heck. I was really hoping for more, but was disappointed.
B00003CXBH|5.0|The way in which The Mission, which is set c. 1750, integrates the life of Rodrigo Mendoza, a former capturer of indigenous people for the slave trade, to the lives of Jesuit missionaries and the lives of the indigenous people of Argentina, Paraguay, and Brazil is absolutely amazing. <br /> I would like to focus on the issue of the indigenous culture of South America that is portrayed in the film-the Guarani Indians.  I feel that the lenses through which the indigenous people are viewed in the film are realistic, as you can say.  There are, basically, two perspectives on the indigenous people in the film.  The first perspective views the indigenous people as \\"animals.\\"  This perspective is held by Don Cabeza and by other representatives that back up Spain's and Portugal's intentions to take over the land of the indigenous, as well as to enslave them.  The second perspective is shared by Father Gabriel, Rodrigo (who, ironically, has become a Jesuit and, therefore, serves the interests of the indigenous people), and the other Jesuit missionaries; this perspective views the indigenous people as valuable human beings with rights. <br /> The relationship among the indigenous community and the Europeans begins by being hostile, for the first Christian priest to arrive to the area is murdered.  However, Father Gabriel accomplishes to win the love and trust of the indigenous people.  <br />The role that religion plays in the film is extremely important.  The indigenous people come to believe the word of the Jesuits-that is, that it is God's will for them to abandon the jungle and build a mission.  Their convictions grow to be so strong that later, when the Cardinal, who professes to speak for Portugal's king and for the Catholic Church, insists that it is crucial for them to abandon the mission, the Guarani leader opposes to do so and, instead, fights back.  Other aspects, regarding the relationship among the Europeans and the indigenous people, that stand out in the videoare the indigenous people's adoption of European religious rituals, beliefs and daily life practices, the role that language plays, and lastly, the issue of power among the oppressing entities of politics and religion. <br />In conclusion, I definitely recommend The Mission.  It is one of the most compelling videos that I have ever watched, and what is most compelling about it is that its historical aspect is actually based on facts.  It brings up the following ideas: What does it mean to be a human being?  Who has the right to determine what a human being's rights are?  How can men be capable of being so selfish, inhumane and cruel to other human beings, yet they are also capable of being so loving and altruistic in such a way that they are willing to give up their lives for others? <br />
B0007Y08QA|5.0|I won't go into detail about this movie because I don't want to ruin it for anyone, but I will say this.  It's plain and simple excellent.  Christian Bale should have been nominated for an oscar and Jennifer Jason Leigh is very good as well.  I've read a few negative things about how fast they tie up the storyline in the ending but I think it was all very well done.  I have no complaints about this movie.  I currently have over 700 DVD's in my collection and \\"The Machinist\\" is definitely in the top 5 of my favorite movies out of that collection.  I agree whole heartedly that this movie is one that definitely worth the money and worth reviewing.  If your a fan of creepy, nightmarish and dripping with dark atmosphere movies....then don't miss one.
B0009VRHLK|2.0|Yeah.  Yeah.  A fine work of art.  Degenerate art perhaps.  Skip the DVD.  The movie sucks terribly.  Just go to any number of celebrity porn sites and download the oral sex scene.  That's the only part anyone really cares about. <br /> <br />My only question about that scene:  Did Chloe really swallow or was she just acting?
B0009A1AS2|4.0|While not their best album, it's far from their worst and I find that I really enjoy \\"Octavarium,\\" Dream Theater's latest CD.  I've always liked how they can experiment with different sounds and not make one album sound like any of the others, yet still retain their signature style and identity.  For the last 4 albums they've been doing what they do best, and this is no exception. <br /> <br />If you don't like bands that change from album to album, then you may not enjoy much of DT's work.  There is a good variety on this album that showcases the different styles they can play (much like \\"Falling Into Infinity\\" or \\"Six Degress...\\"), so it might throw off newer fans who joined the fray because of the dark and heavy \\"Train of Thought.\\"  Mike Portnoy is a self-professed big fan of Muse, and last summer they toured with Yes, and those influences can clearly be heard on this album. <br /> <br />The slower tracks (\\"The Answer Lies Within\\" and \\"I Walk Beside You\\") are as close to mainstream and radio singles as DT has been in a while, but the songs are palatable and grow on you.  The opening track, \\"The Root of All Evil\\" is a continuation of songs from the last two albums (\\"The Glass Prison\\" from 6DOIT and \\"This Dying Soul\\" from TOT) and rehashes some of the same riffs...so it's not spectacular, but I find it interesting to listen to variations on the same themes, much the way King Crimson has done many times over multiple albums. <br /> <br />The final 24-minute track, \\"Octavarium,\\" is pretty good, though not great...the majority of it sounds just like an old Yes epic in the vein of \\"Close to the Edge,\\" but it has those DT influences and in the end it's not bad.  It's definitely different and again, it grows on you. <br /> <br />\\"Never Enough\\" is the only weak track, in my opinion.  The only other thing I don't like about the CD is the sleeve artwork by Hugh Syme.  Makes me feel like I'm holding a Rush CD (Syme has done basically every Rush cover in existence).  It has the same font, etc...bad design, but then, I didn't buy it for the sleeve, so it really doesn't matter in the long run. <br /> <br />Now when comparing this album to other DT albums, one must put everything in perspective.  A lot of people will say \\"oh, they've never put out anything good since Images and Words, blah blah blah...\\"  On the contrary, they've put out a lot of material that's better than \\"Images and Words\\" since then.  People's expectations are too high.  If you like at least 3 of DT's previous albums, you'll like \\"Octavarium.\\"  If you have \\"been a fan\\" since 1992, yet have been disappointed with all their efforts since then, and are still mad that Kevin Moore left the band, then this album is definitely not for you.  You're just old and stuck in a nostalgic time warp.  Times change, music changes, people change.  Things progress.  I'm glad DT takes chances and experiments with every album.  I enjoy their shredding as much as the next guy, but they don't have to do it every single song on every album. <br /> <br />\\"Octavarium\\" is quite a change from their previous album, \\"Train of Thought,\\" and I expected no less.
B00097A5HW|5.0|The music is different, it has soul, it has heart, and it has soooo much talent. Shakira's vocals are uncomparable and her lyrics are passionate and poetic at times. This new album mixes in all her musical roots. La Tortura brings out the cumbia culture of her colombian roots and other songs like Ingles have the rock edge that has always been part of Shakira's style. I love this album, I havent stopped listening to it since I bought it. She's amazing.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This album is very refreshing. I love every single song. I'm not disappointed. This was everything I was hoping for and more. I actually wasn't a huge Coldplay fan before, but now I'm a true fan. X&Y has made me an admirer for life. I can't wait to see where they go with their next album. It looks like it's going to be an exciting journey. And I'm definitely along for the ride. <br /> <br />
B0006L16N8|4.0|To the previous review. I know Coldplay is an excellent band.  <br />It's well known that Chris Martin is a die-hard fan of U2 and due to that Coldplay sounds very similar to U2(not the other way around of course). I understand that hearing your bands new album is a very exciting thing, i love Coldplay and I love the new album too.  <br />Just remember the band which takes its influence from another almost always is never better than the original.  <br />Examples of this is Oasis. They have very distinctive influence from The Beatles(Liam is a John Lennon, as we all) but i can't compare to the real thing). <br />In conclusion, Coldplay is a magnificent band but it lacks the elements to become the biggest band in the world(job taken and deserve by U2). Chris Martin is no Bono, and they sure don't have a The Edge. <br />Thanx.
B0006L16N8|5.0|this band is what great bands are all about; they simply know how to put out great records.  all the fools who think this isn't an awesome album are insane.  the best tracks are \\"Fix You\\", \\"What If\\", \\"Square One\\", and \\"Speed of Sound.\\"  it is just as good as AROBTTH and Parachutes.  if you don't have this album you're missing out on great music.
B0006L16N8|5.0|...and buy this album. <br /> <br />Lots of folks have already used many words to express both love and  revolt for the new, long-awaited album, so I will simply say:  This is an excellent album, and shows that Coldplay has even more strengths and depth than Parachutes and Rush of Blood revealed.  If you are a music fan, you will enjoy this album.  It is quite good, a most enjoyable listen, and it continues to grow and enhance the band as one of the best of all time, and certainly of this current age.
B00005JMJ4|4.0|Tokyo sparkles as the third main character in this sweet, platonic, slice-of-life love story.<br /><br />Set in the dazzling confusion of a far and exotic city, the story is full of courteous characters who communicate beyond words. Understatement and deep feelings abound in the superficial conversations of people just getting acquainted, such as Charlotte and Bob, or already too acquainted and too loosely attached, as in their respective marriages.<br /><br />The music is atmospheric and dreamy, and the soundtrack includes Bill Murray's pleasant karaoke performance of \\"More Than This.\\"<br /><br />Having just returned from Tokyo and loving it, I've watched \\"Lost in Translation\\" at least three times, enjoying the opening scene of the Ginza district at night, its tall neon lights all in bewildering and utterly incomprehensible symbols, and the charming manners and gestures of the people.<br /><br />We pointed to menus, just as Bob and Charlotte did, even in McDonald's, yes, McDonald's for pancake breakfast. It was too early in the morning for another tasty, raw octopus tentacle. And chopsticks were totally daunting. My husband observes that chopsticks, noodles and I were not a pretty sight.<br /><br />I visited an art museum to see a Van Gogh exhibit--a contrast in cultures. I stood in front of Van Gogh's painting of the asylum where he stayed in his bi-polar bouts. A Japanese gentleman in a suit also stood there. We looked at the painting. We looked at each other. We looked at the painting, shook our heads, sighed over Van Gogh's pain. A million words passed between us in those looks.<br /><br />So it was in LIT.<br /><br />The laid-back pace of the character-driven story illustrated their jet-lagged boredom a little too well for my husband, a daughter, and a son-in-law, hence, the four stars. But another daughter and I loved it.<br /><br />The understated, sometimes hilarious performances of the entire cast, including an over-the-top lounge singer and a Britney Spears wannabe are all excellent.<br /><br />And I know I'll never approach an ellyptical machine again without smiling.<br /><br />They could eliminate one tasteless scene, however, without losing the story line, ***when Charlotte says they're going to meet Charlie at a place called Orange. That's a good time to hit a button called Skip*** because it turns out to be a raunchy night club they soon leave, with a vulgar song in the background. The whole scene was out of place, alas, and could have been only suggested or totally left out instead of so in-your-face. Yuck. And the movie would be amusing family fare without it.<br /><br />The song is mercifully left off the wonderful, ethereal sound track.<br /><br />The story could be a good springboard for discussion: Would you mind your spouse, in lonely desperation, sharing a bed, only in platonic innocence, with another?<br /><br />More to the point, how would you keep your spouse--and yourself--from reaching that point of lonely desperation?

B00005LOLD|4.0|Based on the novel by James Michener and directed by Joshua Logan (PICNIC) SAYONARA is a not very subtle account of American soldiers falling for and taking Japanese women for wives during the Korean War era. Marlon Brando in an Air Force Major who at the beginning of the film makes racist comments about Asians, only ultimately to fall in love with a Japanese woman. Alhough this film was probably on the cutting edge in 1957; it hasn't aged very well.<br /><br />  Of course Brando is really not bad in this movie-- he was nominated for an Oscar-- in spite of his strange Southern accent, just like the one he used in a later film REFLECTIONS IN A GOLDEN EYE. He sounds like a Southerner with pebbles in his mouth. Red Buttons as an enlisted man in the Air Force who married a Japanese woman is quite good-- I believe he received an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor-- actually better than Brando even.<br /><br />One thing the movie has going for it is that is is beautifully filmed. The cinematography is not dated at all.<br /><br />This film of course is worth seeing for another chance to watch Mr. Brando.

B0006L16N8|4.0|I hate to say it, but I love A Rush of Blood to the Head much more than X&Y. I want to love it, but right now I just can't. After listening three times it's still growing on me. It'll take time. <br /> <br />Here's what I do like: I love the fact that the music is different. Musical artists should really strive to achieve this as their career progresses and if they want to stick around. I love that Coldplay has finally released new material and that this new effort still sounds like them. <br /> <br />Favorite tracks:  <br /> <br />                         Square One- a really good opener <br /> <br />                         X&Y- should be the next single <br /> <br />                         Speed of Sound- obvious choice, didn't like it at first, but hear it 2 <br />                         or more times a day everywhere and now like it <br /> <br />                          Fix You- next single, and a nice ballad <br /> <br />                          A Message- another good ballad and love the message <br /> <br />So skeptics and big fans  of Coldplay like me, give X&Y another chance. Give it a few more chances even. Just because its Coldplay. With a little time, it will grow on you.

B000001FG5|5.0|This is mostly just awful, the nadir of the Bee Gees' remarkable catalogue. They knew what they were doing in the wake of the astonishing Saturday Night Fever, all right. The packaging gives it away: blow-dried, cynical and slick. As they stand, in wind-blown silhouette against the raging sky, are those really their SHORTS (no pun intended, ever) peeking from between their presumably hairy legs?? Talk about bathos. As for the actual music, only the wonderful 'Tragedy' which leads the suspicious pack is really worthy of the Bee Gees' incredible canon; the rest is mostly filler. Two other tracks stand out as well, but hey- -we're speaking relatively here. The title track and the funky 'Search, Find' provide a mild one-two punch midway through the dreck. Elsewhere, the overweening vapidity of the hits 'Too Much Heaven' and 'Love You Inside And Out' belies whatever creativity informs the arch production; that they were hits at all says a lot about marketing and the state of commercial radio in the beleaguered 70s- -and whose fault was that? I love these guys, and I know they had to get this stuff out of their system, but thank the Helium God they began losing the balloons over the next few releases. Probably started wearing long pants again, too.

B0006L16N8|3.0|For Coldplay, the third time is definately not the charm with the release of their new album XY. The album moves along at a snails pace, and reminds me of REM's last effort, Around the Sun, because of the pacing, and the fact that their really aren't any memorable songs here. If you want to invest your money in an album that shows remarkable range and is a joy to listen to, give BEFORE THE ROBOTS by BETTER THAN EZRA a try.
0671015206|3.0|I found this book in a thrift shop, a strategy the authors surely would applaud (even if it doesn't augment their attempts to accrue prodigious wealth).  While many of their observations and data hold true, there are two constraints they should have mentioned. One is possible cohort effects. Most of the millionaires they interviewed appeared to have grown up in the Depression, when attitudes toward money and resources were shaped by a particular time in history. Will the \\"Millionaires Next Door\\" in 2010 look the same? The second is: where does the fun of life enter in?  Yes, one can save money by buying old cars, eating in diners, living in a trailer, and buying clothes at Sears, but what about enjoyment? There's something to be said for appreciating the finer things in life when one is around to do so, and not everyone lives forever, no matter how good their financial planning may be.  The moralistic tone invoked for any discussion of luxury goods was offputting.
B000059T1E|4.0|-review of the unremastered edition without bonus tracks-<br />This is my favorite Traffic album, and it has some folk elements mixed in with the fusion.<br /><br />\\"Glad\\" starts the album with some slow-burning funk before \\"Freedom Rider\\" unleashes some really funky music with some flute in the mix.<br />\\"Empty Pages\\" is a laidback funk with some nice organ solos.<br />\\"Stranger To Himself\\" is a folk-funk song that serves as a transition to \\"John Barleycorn\\", a folk classic with great lyrics about hops (hence the album cover art) and jazzy flute.<br />\\"Every Mother's Son\\" mixes some grindy organ passages with blues rock similar to Clapton, but according to the booklet, Steve Winwood played the electric guitar and all the other instruments except drums.
B0006L16N8|5.0|let's face it. Coldplay avoided the \\"sophomore jinx\\" quite eloquently with the majestic \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\". i think perhaps that the THIRD album of a \\"new-ish\\" band might be an even BIGGER hurdle to cross (than the SECOND). Coldplay leans on a more \\"expansive\\" sounding record than the previous two. you might expect that success has \\"Rushed\\" to the heads of Martin, Buckland, Berryman and Champion but there are plenty of hints of disillusionment and melancholy on X&Y. rather than getting grounded and bogged down in dispair OR complaceny Coldplay chooses to SOAR with songs regret AND love,...perhaps looking down (but never back). this album really seems to exist somewhere \\"above the ground\\" or \\"in the clouds\\". maybe it's the cloud-like synth breaths that blow behind many of the tracks. maybe it's the fact that vocal harmonies saturate this record TO GREAT EFFECT. it's not a complete departure but it IS artistic growth. these are solid musicians. none stands out. there is no show-boating. it is a cohesive whole. the only weak spot on the record is the nails-on-the-chalkboard vocals and cliched guitar choruses of FIX YOU. The lead single SPEED OF SOUND has a beautifully catchy chorus, THE HARDEST PART jangles delightfully and if SQUARE ONE, WHITE SHADOWS, and especially TALK don't get into your skin,..well....i feel sorry for you. this is (for the most part) a pretty impressive pallette of melodic adventure. DO NOT miss it.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|If you like the DT that gave the world innovative records such as \\"Images and Words\\" or \\"Scenes from a Memory\\", you won't find any of that here, so you may want to avoid this completely. The potential this band has is immense and to squander that talent and write below average music like this is embarrassing.    \\"The Root of all Evil\\" opens with some good heavy guitar riffs, similar to something on \\"Train of Thought\\". Decent tune interlaced with passages from previous songs but nothing new.     \\"The Answer Lies Within\\", a very sappy ballad, is simply atrocious! This could hold the title for the worst DT song ever.      \\"These Walls\\" redeems the CD a bit from the previous stinker, but again, it sounds familiar... not that there is anything wrong with that, but they've done it better before.     \\"I Walk Beside You\\" starts decent enough, with the chugging guitar/bass but is plagued with a very lackluster commercial sounding chorus.     \\"Panic Attack\\" is a great tune. Too bad the whole record isn't like this.     As another reviewer noted, the initial riff of \\"Never Enough\\" is almost note for note a rip-off of \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" by the band Muse. A decent tune, after the plagiarism... but again the chorus seems very weak.     \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" clocks in at 10:42... it wastes time with sound bites followed by approximately 3 minutes of mellow garbage... finally about 4:13 into the song a nice bass riff leads into some awesome instrumental work. Very cool tune if you have the patience to get through the first four minutes.     The epic 24-minute \\"Octavarium\\" Pink Floyd/Yes/Crimson intro ballad part lasts far too long. Finally, at 12:17 the tempo of the tune picks up just in time to salvage the song, for a bit. Time changes, great musicianship, and quite a bit of shredding occur which is DT's  trademark. So why isn't there more of this? Then at 19:53 we hear another keyboard riff that plummets this tune back into ballad land, so unfortunately we are rewarded with only approximately seven minutes of what DT does best.
1400082773|5.0|Dreams from my Father transcends the confines of literary genres. It is an influential book, well worth reading and impossible to characterize. It was first published in 1995, after Obama became the first black president of the Harvard Law Review. Known for his brilliant speech at the Democratic National Convention, Obama's memoir typically goes unnoticed. The arc of Obama's story sweeps countries, from Indonesia to Africa, from Hawaii to Kisumu. This unique autobiography however, is much more. His dedication to community organizing in Chicago compliments his dedication to self-evaluation. Obama constantly seeks to expand his identity and perspective, pulling from his multi-cultural heritage. He is an acute observer, a resourceful analyst, and an outstandingly eloquent author. Obama argues with himself on almost every page. He gets you to agree with him then presents a counter-narrative that seems just as convincing. He powerfully dismisses stereotypes only to show how much we are all caught between messy contradictions. Indeed, the US is a nation of displaced immigrants and migrants and their children, who seek authenticity. Dreams from my Father is full of truths, which at times like these may feel refreshing. I strongly encourage the questioning reader to give this book a shot.  <br /> <br />

B000065PUE|5.0|If you like or have ever heard of Nirvana, Pearl Jam, STP, My Bloody Valentine, Sonic Youth and such - You've got to start listening to Pixies.  The Pixies were (and still are) one of the most well hidden treasures of alternative rock. This is due to the fact that you probably won't hear this on the mainstream radio and most people are unaware that this band created it's own dynamics and laid the path for uncountable bands ahead. The lyrics are very well written, full of metaphors and the sound is disturbing and original - They sometimes break the default tempo of the song or throw certain riffs at your ear which woudn't work for any other band. This is not an ordinary band/sound, so your brain might need some time to get used to it. Give it the time and you shall be greatly rewarded.
B000092Q4U|5.0|I remember a couple of years ago when I first heard 11th Hour and my jaw hit the floor, KLUNK!  In a time where metal outside of the death and black metal genres had become quite stale and corporate here comes this breath of fresh air in the form of Lamb of God.  It satisfied my taste for old school thrash metal, and my love for death metal at the same time, can it get any better than this?  This album rips from beginning to end and I still prefer it over the other two releases, New American Gospel was good but not great, and Ashes of the Wake although superior in many ways just doesn't get me going like A.T.P.B.  Call it nostalgia, this reminds me of something straight out of '94 like a cross between Slayer and \\"Low\\" era Testament.  Ruin is one fantastic anthem of pure hate and destruction and the violence does not cease until the closing moments of Vigil.  This is pure metal at its finest, and should be added to the collection of any fan of thrash or extreme metal in general.  In fact pick up all three of their albums you will not be disappointed, and if you want some raw, more death metal driven Lamb of God check out the Burn the Priest CD which is also killer.  And for the record, there is nothing hardcore or metalcore or whatever core about these guys.  Buy this disc, turn the knob up to 11, and happy headbanging!
B000002H33|5.0|\\"I wonder how that happened? Maybe it had something to do with Dave Mustaine leaving the band\\" - I found this in a reveiw by a retard who goes by the name \\"Ridge\\". He also gave it a 1 star reveiw. Wether you want to admit to yourself or not Ridge, Mustaine did not leave Metallica - he was KICKED OUT. and it was the best decision ever made in metal history for TWO reasons. Reason #1: MEGADETH IS AN AWESOME BAND. If he wasnt booted from Metallica, Megadeth would be inexistant, simple as that. <br />#2 Kirk Hammett was recruited and Metallica went on to make some of the best metal ever recorded (as heard on this Gem). Not to say that hammett is better than mustaine or anything (which he most definatly is not) but Metallica just wouldn't be the same Metallica without him, and master of puppets would sound alot different. And Ridge, Master of Puppets is an incredible album. Dave Mustaine himslef could not create something so amazing (legions of metalheads will disagree with me there). <br />Simply put, MOP is my all time favoite album. It's amazing. And it really rotts me that since the release of St. Anger the average customer rating of this album has been lowered down from 5 stars (where it truely belongs). The people who say this albums sucks don't have an effing clue what they're talking about. They're just jumping on the trend of bashing metallica, which is fashionable at the moment, with the not so well accepted St. Anger. When ppl talk about metallice its like \\"metallica? yeah, sellouts, gargabe\\". No. \\"metallica, puppets, burton, ktulu, awesome. This is metal perfection people. I am deeply anticipating Metallica's next release by the way. LONG LIVE METALLICA!!!!!!
0765301598|1.0|Having read the other prequels in this and the House series, I had lowered my expectations from anticipating great literature, to just enjoying a narrative story.  But, a few key story elements that I had waded through two books and several years to get to, were tossed out.  It was too much, just 1 example here, to bite off as forced plot elements \\"mystical\\" spring water suddenly revealing to one individual many of the key powers of the Bene Gesserit (sp).  Others have mentioned the monotony of continuous repetition of the characteristics of 1-dimensional characters.  One thing few have mentioned, is the senseless and frequent graphic descriptions of gore- and done so unimaginatively (how many times did the words \\"ruptured tendons\\" appear in the space of 20 pages?).  <br /> <br />Anyway, hope they didn't leave open the door for more books in the BG period, and will take some serious time in making a masterpiece out of Dune 7.  Cheers all!
B000005RS0|5.0|The folks at Capitol/EMI did absolutely EVERYTHING right (even the fade-outs on the bonus tracks), with this stunning re-issue of Tina's classic 1984 comeback album, \\"Private Dancer.\\"  Clocking in at 77:57, with original and new pictures, lyrics, and above all, newly remastered sound, it's as if you're hearing these great songs for the first time all over again.  Not only a superb album, this sets a standard of excellence for re-issued and remastered classics that all others should learn from, follow and be judged by.  First-class all the way!<br /><br />Not only that, if you are a true Tina fan, the bonus tracks are worth the price of the CD alone.  Previously unavailable on CD, 4 of these bonus tracks were 45 rpm single B-sides, and they are 4 of the very best.  \\"I Wrote A Letter,\\" and \\"Don't Rush The Good Things\\" rock, while \\"Rock and Roll Widow\\" is silky soul that could easily have been on \\"Private Dancer.\\"  The best of the four, though, \\"When I Was Young,\\" is one of Tina's finest performances on ANY disc, especially her primal wailing of the title at the end.  Raw, pure and fine.  The CD ends with three more generous extended mixes of \\"What's Love Got To Do With It,\\" \\"Better Be Good To Me\\" and \\"I Can't Stand The Rain,\\" all of which play it safe by sticking fairly close to the original versions, but are nonetheless terrific. DON'T miss out on this CD - it remains one of Tina's best (and that's hard to improve on), but in this case - is even BETTER!
0446605409|5.0|I've read all of DeMille's novels and they are all very enjoyable but this one stands out among the rest.  John Corey is always humorous in his various novels but he is laugh-out-loud funny in this one.  I've often chuckled to myself at his one liners in other books but I've never seen the people around me roll their eyes at me because I was laughing so hard.  They always ask me what is so funny and I'm forced to tell them, \\"you've gotta read the book.\\" <br /> <br />This book is the best blend of crisis, a layered plot, interesting characters and a strong pace.  Corey can sometimes come off as brash and often rude but ultimately, he is a very likeable protagonist.  DeMille does an excellent job of hiding his intelligence behind a wise-cracking front.  We are also introduced to Beth Penrose who plays the perfect straight man to Corey.  I think she's a better fit for Corey than Kate Mayfield, who DeMille has Corey marry in his later books.  There are just enough elements to this story to keep the reader on their toes but not so much as to lull them into an apathetic boredom.  Very highly recommended.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|What is left to say about this movie. The remake was a joke. there can be no remakes. this is one of the greatest horror movies EVER made. Romero is beyond genius. he was so far ahead of his time that so many people tried to copy him without success. this movie stands alone as an original and cannot be remade or duplicated. i have this DVD as well as two others. i have seen it dozens of times, and learn something new every time i watch it. i am old enough that i saw it when it was released to theaters originally and have not stopped watching it since then.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Parachutes started the craze, and A Cold Rush Of Blood To The Head made Coldplay an international phenomenon, but X&Y is arguably better than both its predicessors. The creative lyrics and melodies are intoxicating, and the vocal range of Chris Martin never ceases to amaze. X&Y also brings coldplay more to their roots, they use a whole lot more gutair than \\"A Cold Rush\\" and the result is hard to ignore. Not only are there great songs like White Shadows and Low that sound more like the Coldplay of old, there is also Speed of Sound, amoung others, that sound more like the Coldplay of recent years. X&Y rocks.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Well, another magical moment spent with DT... Can't wait to see them on tour!  I've listened to the album for about 6 times now, it gets better every time!  I'm a huge fan of DT and the thing with them is that they're able to move you forward, that's the achievement of really being a prog-metal band! <br /> <br />Thank you Dream theater for all the great music. <br />Bern
B0006L16N8|5.0|...but I certianly don't care..X&Y is a grand and beautifully crafted peice of work.  Stand out tracks are Square One, Speed of Sound (a gorgeous and epic song), and Low..these also happen to be the tracks that to me seem most influenced by U2.  It does not and should not matter. X&Y is Coldplay's most adventerous CD to date.  It will be hard to find a better album this year.
B0006L16N8|5.0|In an ideal world, all music would have this much style and substance. But it's not an ideal world, it's Coldplay. At least we know of one band that has mastered high art, yet found away to make it commercial and accessible. This has to be one of the most poetic and elegant CD's I've ever heard. It's quite cinematic. It's very nostalgic and has more of an 80's sound. But it's impressive coming from someone that is so contemporary. I thought everyone had forgotten some of music's glory days. Coldplay to the rescue. We should all thank them for being students of great music. In an era when most Rock bands are annoying clones of each other, Coldplay has masterfully found a way to stand high above the crowd. It's hard to make music that's truly captivating and that seizes the senses, but \\"X&Y\\" succeeds on so many levels. This album is truly a diamond amongst ordinary jewels.
B0009OPO0S|3.0|This has a more mellow feel to it compared to the recent \\"Live\\" cd/dvd. The inclusion of male vocalist did not do much for me. The dvd side has a video which is fair and a blurry interview. Overall, I was ecpecting a bit more after the 5 star \\"Live\\" cd/dvd. Maybe the November release will be better.
B000089RVX|5.0|Over 13 million albums sold and 6x platnuim, do I need to say more? Evanescence is the best thing to happen in a long time. Their music is just out of this world and the band just rules. Amy Lee the singer has the best voice ever and has been said she is the best Rock female singer since Blondie. And the rest of the members Rocky Gray (drums), John LeCompt (guitar), Terry Balsamo (their new guitarist he's not on here) and William Boyd (bass guitar) just kick butt and can really rock!!! And Ben Moody, have fun writing songs with Avril and Kelly Clarkson, Amy is way better then them!!!! All the songs on the album are written by Amy Lee (wrote most of the lyrics not BEN MOODY!!), X-Band member Ben Moody (wrote some lyrics and the music) and also on some songs David Hodges. Ok now on to the album: <br /> <br />Going Under (10/10): I love this song!! This song is the one that got me to buy the album. It is a very dark song in parts and then just rocks the rest!! This song is about an abusive relationship or anything you can relate to it seems. <br /> <br />Bring Me To Life (9/10): This is the song that started it all from them. I really don't like this song that much but its an awesome love song.  <br /> <br />Everybody's Fool (10/10): This is my favorite song on the album!!! It's about fake people like Britney Spears who will do anything to sell a CD! Love it, Love it, Love it!! <br /> <br />My Immortal (10/10): This song is the most beautiful song ever writen. It has earned the band many of awards. One being the most sold sheet music. I love this song very much and can relate to it. <br /> <br />Haunted (10/10): This another one of my favorite songs, it's about an abusive relationship. The voice syncronizers work perfect in this song. Unlike Britney and them Amy can sing and only uses voice effects to make the song eary not to improve her singing. <br /> <br />Tourniquet (10/10): This song is about suiside but is a cover song. The drummer Rocky Gray was in a band before Evanescence and they wrote this song. Amy and Ben redid the song and it sounds perfect!! <br /> <br />Imaginary (10/10): Another beauitful song by Evanescence which is about not wanting to be where you live or how you live, you want to live in your imaginary world where everything is perfect. I really like this song because I can totally relate to it!! <br /> <br />Taking Over Me (10/10): Probably to most under-rated song on the album. This song is a love song about wanting and dreaming about someone you have a crush on or just need that person. I can relate to this song alot and am still dreaming about Amy Lee (why haven't you called lol). <br /> <br />Hello (10/10): Another beauitful song, this one is about Amy Lee's little sister who tragicly died at a young age. So far there has been no performance of this song at any Evanescence concert. This is a slow song and a very haunting one at that. Amy Lee shows us her singing talent in this one and I give major props to her!! <br /> <br />My Last Breath (8/10): I don't listen to this one much because I just don't, I guess. It has an awesome part in it though where it goes:  <br />\\"i'll miss the winter <br />a world of fragile things <br />look for me in the white forest <br />hiding in a hollow tree (come find me) <br />i know you hear me <br />i can taste it in your tears\\" <br />This part is just amazing! The meaning is weird though, it is about telling someone you love them before you die, I think. <br /> <br />Whisper (10/10): This song I think is about suiside but I don't know. It is the heaviest song on the album and I am guessing the preppy people hate it, am I right? All I can say is Whisper is a very crazy song live and I love it!!! <br /> <br />----------------------------------------- <br />I can't wait for the next Evanescence album, I heard rumors about it being out later in '05 so hold on tight and stay in there. If you don't already, make sure you pick up Evanescence's Anywhere But Home DVD/CD of theirlive concert in Paris!!! It's awesome and crazy so go check it out!!! And trust me it's 110% percent live, that band rules and you hear every song from Fallen (except Hello) live and some others not on Fallen!!!!!! Well cya next time!!
B00065JTBA|5.0|Bon Jovi is my all time favorite artist  and group and they kicked butt again.  But I have to wonder how many other songs they did that aren't realease, I would love to listen to them as well. I highly recommend it.  I would give it 100 stars out of five.
B0006L16N8|5.0|With much anticipation, I picked up my copy of X & Y almost cowering in it's presence, hoping that it would be as thrilling as all of the other material put out by Coldplay in the past years. I was not disappointed!!<br /><br />There is something about X & Y that makes it very familiar and connectable to fans, yet is not totally typical. The unmistakable trademark presence of Chris Martin's voice and the personal quality to this record are what make it awesome.<br /><br />Songs:<br /><br />Square One - awesome guitar work, and the lyrics are fantabulous. Just about being a person, no matter who status and wanting to have someone validate you, listen to you and understand you.<br /><br />What If - Beautiful piano and vocals. A song about no matter who you are, something bad can always happen in one single second.<br /><br />White Shadows - Different rhythm feel for the band. Song is about feelings and uncertainty.<br /><br />Fix You - Typical Chris Martin, very light and spiritual almost. Song about relationships and trying to fix them.<br /><br />Talk - The Quintessential Coldplay sound. Another song about uncertainty, possibly relationship based.<br /><br />X & Y - Also, very typical Coldplay style so it is the title song. This song is about putting yourself into a relationship, and then it not working out but the longing for it to work.<br /><br />Speed of Sound - First single and most likely the most familiar style to mainstream fans who are not used to Coldplay's various sounds. A juiced up version of \\"Clocks\\" with an emphasis on discovery.<br /><br />A Message - Quiet and somewhat obscure at first. Has a very redemptive quality to it. Possibly based on a hymn called, \\"MY SONG IS LOVE UNKNOWN\\"?<br /><br />Low - A turning point in the album. A song about lonely, closeminded people.<br /><br />The Hardest Part - Much more up-tempo and \\"happy\\". Defintely about breaking up, or leaving a certain relationship or position.<br /><br />Swallowed by the Sea - An outwardly uplifting and positive song almost about getting someone back from losing them.<br /><br />Twisted Logic - A song with a haunting melody about standing up for your own beliefs and feelings, and dreams and hopes and not letting the general populous tell you what you should think.<br /><br />Til Kingdom Come - Chris sounds very different on this song, originally written for Johnny Cash. This is a typical, yet wonderful song about life and love.<br /><br />Truly this is an album about the ordinary person and the feelings, doubts, triumphs, trial and the experiences that they go through.Sea - An outwardly uplifting and positive song almost about getting someone back from losing them. <br /> <br />Twisted Logic - A song with a haunting melody about standing up for your own beliefs and feelings, and dreams and hopes and not letting the general populous tell you what you should think. <br /> <br />Til Kingdom Come - Chris sounds very different on this song, originally written for Johnny Cash.

B0000D96NW|5.0|In 1994, Machine Head made 'Burn My Eyes,' a great (and very original)<br />heavy metal album. But from about that year until now, things went downhill<br />for the band. They still made albums, but almost no one was interested in<br />them. Starting with 'Burning Red,' an album that essentially put a dividing<br />line between fans, the group became nu-metal (or if not nu-metal, than<br />something very close to it) and also came close to copping other bands,<br />like Tool. M.H. risked being one of those bands that put out a strong debut<br />album, then didn't release anything else worthwhile for the rest of their<br />career.<br /><br />2004, however, is a new year, and a new album ('Through the Ashes of the<br />Empires') that might be the best album of their career. If it's not, then<br />it is at least, hands down, the most inspired, brutal, and all around<br />strongest Machine Head album in ten years. Some accuse them of jumping off the sinking nu-metal ship and onto the popular New Wave of American Heavy Metal. That is probably true, but, since the new sound is so awesome, I<br />hardly care. Plus, maybe it wasn't a desperate attempt to stay relevant--maybe Machine Head just got a kick in the butt and decided to go<br />back to their roots.<br /><br />'Through the Ashes of the Empires' is sort of like a cross between new<br />Fear Factory and old school Sepultura, but the new album doesn't sound like every other<br />metal C.D. that is popular right now. There are no typical NWoAHM riffs<br />here, and no acoustic interludes. To add diversity, many of these songs<br />start differently, and some of them are a completely different speed than<br />others. Plus, singer Robert Flynn sometimes lowers his voice and even<br />croons.<br /><br />Highlights include:<br /><br />'Imperium' starts out lightly, with one guitarist playing slow, simple<br />strings in each headphone. After hearing the opening, the listener wonders<br />what kind of album they're in for...but all that changes around the<br />40-second mark, when the power chords make a booming entrance. On top of<br />that, the drummer (Dave McClain) sounds like he's trying to crack his snare<br />drum. The guitars speed up (with the drums hitting at the same time) and<br />the vocals begin around a minute and forty seconds into the song. Part of<br />this song is cleanly sung, part of it is yelled, and there's a really cool<br />part during a pause when you can hear Rob breathing in. Machine gun bass<br />drums end this song.<br />'Bite the Bullet' has a small smattering of drums at the beginning, then<br />Rob snarls like a demon and the guitars turn to heavy, rhythmic riffing.<br />'Left Unfinished' begins with noise from what sounds like a baby's toy or<br />crib. This abruptly ends, however, when Rob belts out like he's been<br />punched in the stomach ('Ew!') Then he launches into a tirade against his<br />mother and father (he was put up for adoption by his real parents). These<br />lyrics are very personal, heartfelt, and show that he's both pissed off and<br />hurt. At one point, he yells 'I'll never forget...parents that brought me<br />this pain.'<br />'Elegy' has a screeching intro (which sounds like pick slides), then the<br />guitars turn to heavy chugging. Rob almost croons again at the beginning<br />(and during the middle, which is soft). After the mid-section, the next<br />verse builds and erupts with a wall of metal.<br />'In the Presence of my Enemies' opens with slow, pounding drums. The<br />guitars on this song lurch so smoothly that they almost groove, and the<br />vocals are almost whispered, at first. A good, ten second guitar solo is<br />included, and near the song's end, the vocals become a capella (even though<br />Rob is barking as furiously as ever).<br />'Vim' has another drum intro, but this one is fast, a bit longer, and it<br />almost sounds like a drum machine. But it's when the guitars begin that I<br />know this might be the best song on the album. This whole song is very<br />fast, with a running beat, deft drumming and blinding guitars. After the<br />middle (which features guitar work that's even faster than usual), there's<br />a speedy, two part solo that keeps up with the pace of the song. Near the<br />end, the listener can really tell how crazy the drum work was during this<br />song.<br />'Descend the Shades of Night' is partially acoustic (both the intro and<br />outro is), with more proper singing.<br /><br />Megadeth are another band that experimented with and commercialized their<br />sound. And, just as Megadeth did in 2004, Machine Head made a triumphant<br />return with a killer C.D. But where do they go from here? Have they come<br />full circle, and reached the pinnacle of their career?<br /><br />I believe both bands are at the top of their game, and have brought their<br />careers full circle, but I also believe that they still have plenty of good<br />material left in them. Granted, this album raises the bar high, but I think<br />if Machine Head keep the sound they have now, and aim their sights high,<br />they will succeed in making another great album.<br /><br />But, even if they don't ever make another C.D. of this quality, that<br />doesn't mean that you can't enjoy 'Through the Ashes of the Empires.'

B00005JKC3|4.0|The Hulk is one of those comic book characters that is so utterly fantastic that any film adaption of him was probably doomed from the start.  To begin with, he's a giant green man.  And when audiences see a giant green man smashing a tank with his bare hands, they generally aren't sure what to make of it.  It's absurd, sure, but let's be honest, all superheroes are absurd. <br /> <br />The Hulk's biggest weakness is, oddly enough, the TV show that made him so popular.  Because it was TV and there weren't great special effects, people tend to think of him as a largish, bodybuilder with marginal superstrength.  Sorry.  The Hulk is a big dog in the world of megamuscles.  And by being truer to the comic than the show, most the audience was confused. <br /> <br />Onto the film.  It's good, but slow.  I've watched it a couple of times, and I can't for the life of me figure out what I would've cut out, but it still does kind of creep along at points.  The performances are all strong, particularly Eric Bana as Bruce Banner.  It could've been a throwaway part, but he does solid work portraying a quiet man with deep psychological scars. <br /> <br />The Hulk himself is an outstanding creation.  If you forget that giant green man part, you'll see just how incredibly realistic he is, and how soulful his virtual performance is.  The action scenes are terrific, especially the gamma dogs:  a fight that is every bit as brutal as it should be.  Unfortunately, the final confrontation and it's resolution could've been clearer.  But if you pay attention, it'll make sense. <br /> <br />Just go in with an open mind or don't go in at all.
B00005JNEW|4.0|Five years after \\"Varsity Blues,\\" another film about West Texas high school football comes with Billy Bob Thornton as Coach Gary Gaines who must lead his team to the championship, no matter what it takes.  Based on the real games and the real people, who participated in the 1988 season, 'Friday Night Lights' is more authentic and often alarmingly realistic than 'Varsity Blues' (which I like), in describing the glory of being the star players, and revealing the reality surrounding them. <br /> <br />Director Peter Berg (The Rock's successful 'The Rundown'), perhaps inevitably, spends most of the films on the life on and out of the field of the high school players -- THE star of the team 'Booobie' (Derek Luke), team leader Mike (Lucas Black), and Charles (Tim McGraw) whose abusive father keeps on telling how he is disappointed with his son.  So far, things are not new.  If you think one of them is too confident, you already know what will happen to him.    <br /> <br />To see the life of Coach Gaines, with good acting from Billy Bob Thornton, is more intersting to me, for his life in the city of Odessa, Texas, could be very intense, nearly life-or-death matter.  The townspeople come to the Coach, and then, quietly tell him that their team must win -- if not directly, with uninvited suggestions.  And as far as the football goes, when they wish something, that something must be realized.  Like winning the State. <br /> <br />[CONVENTIONAL BUT SOLID] Despite the semi-documentray touch of the slightly shaky and grainy photography, the film is made with an orthodox approach.  At first the film has some moments showing the players' doubts about their way of life, or even the way of the football itself (and the community that suppport with enthusiasm), but gradually the heroism takes them over, with the exciting scenes of the bone-crunching games and dedicated football players.  The story is very conventional, but the presentation is solid and well-paced. <br /> <br />Like his previous 'The Rundown,' Peter Berg conducts everything with confidence, and the results are very satisfactory even though you don't particularly like the world of American high school football.  Even if you don't come to like the sports itself, you come to understand the people in this small town where the Friday Night Lights mean everything to them, the glory, the life and all.
B0006A9FKA|4.0|Let's get something straight.  This movie is not a parody, satire, or homage to zombie movies.  Any of those labels undercuts this entertaining film.  Just because a story has a healthy dose of humor that doesn't mean it should be dismissed as merely a comedy send up.  Shaun of the Dead is much more sophisticated that that.  Mostly. <br /> <br />The cleverness of this film is that it understands that zombie movies have been done to death, and that makes them predictable.  But the question is, if we suddenly found ourselves in the middle of one, how long would it take us to notice?  It takes Shaun quite a while, and when he does, he's like any of us.  Scared, confused, and more than a little incompetent, which leads to a lot of comic situations. <br /> <br />But this is not just a comedy.  People die.  Gruesomely.  Shaun experiences real loss.  And the best and worst of people is explored in a way that is often seen in zombie movies but still somehow seems fresh and interesting in this one. <br /> <br />The only weak spot is the end, which is a bit jokey and in my opinion, just a step out of tune with the rest of the film.  But it's still kind of funny, and a small sin.  So enjoy this film.  But please don't dismiss it if it causes you to chuckle now and then.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Well well well, what can you say when it's Dream Theater.I've been listening them since A Change of Seasons came out in 1995 and so now writing being as a great fan for these long years. Today I have listened Octavarium two times.All knows when it's progressive music two times is never enough to get really into it but well my friends let me tell you the truth; It's an epic. <br />A special moment in DT history,you can hear the blueprints of Dream Theater times but this time they really go and stretch themselves more and more which may make this album somewhat strange to the self-thought listeners.So they will make you confused. <br />Now let me tell you,for those who are not open-minded about DT music and who likes categorizing the music that he/she listens won't fit this album any place (which makes it unique and special and really an excellent thing) so they will go like absurd reviews and 1 star. Don't take them seriously.The only real thing is the music&lyrics of Octavarium shines brilliantly.If you're a fan of DT, I'm sure you will dig it and love it. If you're not a fan of DT but open-minded about listening new music, give this album a try. If you're not a DT fan and wanna heard the same sound every album go&buy some stuff from pop or exremete sections.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This band is 3 for 3 hands down. At first they seemed like one of those bands that may disappear without a trace after their first album. There's nothing like a pleasant surprise in a 1st album surpassing second album, but now that the 3rd is hear, those fears of the vanishing band are gone! Already anticipating #4!

Star Trek was ok but eventually sigh, yawn, snore...Star Wars was good in the original but now I could care less if Lucas thinks Bush is Darth Vader. <br />Firefly is different.  I love the mixture of west meets space. The actors are excellent - I'm glad to see Nathan has gone beyond the \\"girl and a pizza shop\\".

But then, all they want eventually is just a channel of teenagers trying to sing. <br />All I can say is...buy this damn DVD set, you won't regret it. <br />Go see the movie and enjoy yourself... <br />and let's get some stuffed shirts at some network to put this puppy back on....and give the actors a raise while they're at it, just for good measure.
B000002PB2|3.0|I dusted this effort off recently while transferring a wealth of vinyl to digital. Musically the album, like you would expect from such a talented band, is very good. With a couple guitarslingers like Jeff Watson and the underrated Brad Gillis you expect a lot. The songs are hit and miss though. At times the band shows uncanny pop sensibility with songs such as \\"Don't Tell You Love Me\\" and \\"Young Girl in Love\\" and at other times can't seem to find a good melody such as \\"Play Rough\\" \\"Eddie's comin' out Tonight\\". Knowing the two heavyweights playing guitar makes one expect more from the band, but alas, they could never deliver a solid front to back album. I find it interesting to look back at videos from this era a see that \\"Fitz\\" Gerald and the keyboardist from Prince's \\"1999\\" era band  band both mined the surgeon-in-scrubs look. LOL. The album is worth picking up though, just to get the epic \\"Don't Tell Me...\\" a rocker for the ages. This alone gets it an extra star.
B0006L16N8|5.0|simply stated -  coldplay does it again.  these peices grab my attention and soul.   I had goosebumps within the first 8 seconds of listening to the cd.....  <br /> <br />
B000002B35|3.0|Pulse is a hearty slice of the Water-less Pink Floyd caught live. David Gilmour, released from the so-called shackles of Roger Waters, sets the controls for the heart of the money bag and carries on with the band plus a host of sidemen. The Pink Floyd sound is here albeit minus the desperate Roger Waters vocals, but it's all here. The songs presented here all are played with precision and to great effect, but of course, something's missing. That something is the heart and soul of Pink Floyd, Roger Waters. Gilmour is second to none in emotional melodic guitar wizardry and the rest of the Floyd originals do their parts very well, but the band just doesn't have the exasperated paranoia that Waters gives. I love Floyd, but I only like this Pink Floyd. A better representation of the sound of Pink Floyd is in the hands of Roger Waters' Bleeding Hearts Band. Waters' live DVD is indeed somthing to behold and most assuradly outclasses the Gilmour Floyd. Why? Because Waters holds the key to the Pink Floyd Sound. It's in his bones. Waters can replace Gilmour's position with the likes of Jeff Beck, Snowy White, or Doyle Bramhall, but Gilmour's Floyd has yet to replace the Waters' point of view, lyrics, or vocal stylings. It's too bad for fans that these two (Waters and Gilmour) can't bury the proverbial hatchet and find a common ground. Till then proceed with caution when it comes to Pink FLoyd, but feel safe in testing the Waters.
0440238609|5.0|Here's my take on the four issues that seem to be raised most often with regard to these books - their supposed anti-religious message, the failings of the book #3 and suitability for children. <br /> <br />I seriously do not understand why people say that these books are 'against religion'. The way I see it, they are against a religious establishment that is given extraordinary powers - the same powers as the Catholic establishment actually did have in medieval Europe. The power to burn people for saying the earth goes around the sun, the power to declare a scientific idea a 'heresy', the power to torture to 'cleanse one of evil', and to make you an outlaw if you dare to disagree with any part of the dogma, ... the condemnation of any sensual pleasure as sinful,... the practice of selling 'indulgences' where you could pay money and be forgiven a sin, ... The author condemns ideological totalitarianism - lots of people are very comfortable with ridiculing fundamentalist islamic regimes - how about swallowing a Christian version of Saudi Arabia? <br />    <br />I found the 'message' of the book hopeful - the call to try to make a paradise where we are, and to live our lives so that we'd have some stories to tell when they are over. And the idea that when we die we become part of all sorts of living things again, and there is a joy in it.    <br /> <br />Reading the reviews,I was really surprized to see how many people liked the 1st book best, and the 3rd least. I myself have been telling people to just get through the first one, the 2nd one is much better, and the 3rd one is the greatest - fewer magic tricks, more food for thought. But then, I am not the type to regret not having lengthy descriptions of 'epic battles'... As for not having everying 'spelled out' for you - I view it as the author's leave to give me, the reader, room for interpretation. Go and look at Tolkien's preface to the Lord of the Rings and his distinction between metaphor and allegory...  <br /><br />As for suitability for children, I think kids aren't given enough credit for their ability to judge for themselves and to choose. I myself read Anna Karenina at the age of 8 for the first time and was deeply annoyed when people kept telling me that I 'won't understand anything' . I understood the bits that were relevant and interesting to me at this age, and I enjoyed it - now, at 30, I appreciate other parts of it more, and I am sure that the book will read completely differently when I am 60, - which is not a reason to wait till then to read it. I think that 'His Dark Materials' is, too, a book, that has the potential to grow as you do, and if a child can read, (s)he is old enough to give it a try.
B0006L16N8|2.0|X&Y finds Coldplay reworking their sound, adding sonic filler akin to their idols, Kraftwerk, Brian Eno, Depeche Mode, etc. I hesitate to include Depeche Mode in that list since, save for lead single Speed of Sound, the new album is just a collection of epic songs with no concrete message or purpose, odes to either the majesty or mediocrity of the universe, I can't tell; think Daylight, A Whisper, or Politik without any argument, times ten; there's just no charisma to the album, nothing that would make me play it aside of rainy days or huddling miserably in some odd corner, and certainly nothing even remotely radio-friendly like Depeche Mode. I'm convinced that those fans who listen to this album, who don't worship Radiohead and odd odes to quiet as artistic genius, will yearn badly for the simple, plaintive Coldplay of their past albums. Nothing on this album nearly matches the yearning or contrition of Trouble, Shiver, Sparks, The Scientist, Clocks, Green Eyes, Warning Sign, A Rush of Blood to the Head, Amsterdam, I Ran Away, Crests of Waves, or Moses. <br /> <br />Played live on the MTV live leak show, song A Message showed some promise, but on the album, it and What If, Fix You, and Low ring hollow. Excepting the Johnny Cash folk song 'Til Kingdom Come, which struggles on its own continuing Parachutes' waiting, the other songs all come across as modern day Pink Floyd covers. Read the lyrics to album closer tracks 10, 11 and 12; there's no punch to the gut, or to the face. <br /> <br />Word is that Coldplay dropped everything and started anew while making this album, ala Oasis on Definitely Maybe. Whether or not this contributed to the lyrics being so empty, I don't know, but without the want or misery of their better work, Coldplay is not the same. Contentment suits them badly.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|nothing much to say.. it's all said by these five guys. <br />I've been a fan of DT since the wonderful debut \\"Dream & Day\\", Images & Words\\" was a constant tape in my walkman.. but as yers passed by, i believe that they improved the musicianship while the songwriting approached avarage.. and the sound got harder with each new album.. i can be considered a metal fan but not a fanatic, and being a songwriter myself, i always look for excitement and enthusiasm in music. the \\"in-between\\" albums were always lacking these.  <br /> <br />Before i listened to Octavarium, i feared that they had recorded another heavy and talent showing album, and if that was the case, i would not mind missing their concert in Istanbul, 3rd of July.  <br /> <br />I wont talk about the album much, but it is a complete work of art that i cant let go of.. During work, it's constantly in my ears, over and over again.. i cant stop listening.. i'm amazed, speechless.. <br /> <br />One thing that is very important i think is that this time Mike Portnoy is really playing the drum, not sacrificing good music for the sake of showing talent. this actually goes for all the other guys. James sings great, he shows that he is a real singer, with a great and emotive voice. Jordan and John are in a great harmony, i cant wait to see them live.. and mr. myung has the best bass sound ever since the debut. <br /> <br />I'm waitin DT, see you in Istanbul!! Thanks!!
B0000CDLA7|4.0|It seems a lot of people have forgotten what \\"Progressive\\" really means.  Here I go referencing Webster's: \\"1. moving forward in space; advancing. 2. increasing by successive stages. 3. a progress toward something better...\\"  Progressive music is driven by the notion that music isn't stagnant.  It's made up of passionate people who really want to explore and create new music, not just print lyrics up with some variations on the same old same old.<br /><br />From interviews I've read of Dream Theater, they say that Train of Thought was just something they wanted to do.  They all have a fascination with metal music, and they used this album to explore that side of their music.  And they did a damn good job!  Take the heavier moments in their music and expand them to a full-length album, just as advanced, just as impressive, and you've got a good idea of what TOT is like.<br /><br />If you're offended by the idea that Dream Theater likes metal or really any genre of music besides Awake, Images&Words, et al, then why are you listening to progressive metal in the first place?<br /><br />\\"Stream of Consciousness,\\" an 11-minute instrumental, is my favorite track on the album.  It is flawlessly executed, and I can't get enough of it.  Also noteworthy are the drums on \\"Honor Thy Father.\\"  Mike Portnoy will blow you away on this album.  The general idea of the whole album is that these guys are incredible musicians, who are more than capable of making fantastic albums, in virtually any musical realm they would like to.<br /><br />Perhaps try comparing this album to some of the other \\"straight-up metal\\" choices out there.  This album over St. Anger?  Maybe we'd be giving out 31-star ratings, as opposed to 2-star ratings.

B0006L16N8|5.0|I've been a Coldplay fan since 2000, and it amazes me how popular they've become in the past 5 years.  Their older work is very broken-down, mostly acoustic.  I was honestly a little disappointed with A Rush of Blood to the Head because it seemed too polished, too overworked.  This album, in some regards, travels in the same direction, but the result with this one is much more hit than miss.<br /><br />The tracks are no longer depressing vocals layered over an acoustic guitar and light drums (although I loved that sound).  X&Y features lush keyboards, more up-front basslines, and even a few drumloops running in the background.  I'm honestly surprised that this approach works so well for Coldplay.<br /><br />The music is beautiful.  You feel like you're staring across an open sky and some sort of musical spectrum.  These songs feel like they have depth to them, but it's not overdone.  There's a feeling of intelligence and profundity, but it isn't snobbish or conceited or arrogant.  You could even call this music humble.  But that's a very abstract way to review a CD.<br /><br />The thing that impresses me about this CD, which is true of all of Coldplay's CDs, is that none of the songs particularly stand out, but the CD doesn't get boring or laborious to listen to.  Coldplay fans should like this CD if they try not to let the new musical elements bother them.  Anyone else who perhaps has heard \\"Speed of Sound\\" on the radio will definitely want to give the rest of this CD a chance.<br /><br />This is still Coldplay, but I'm glad they've taken some steps to keep from regurgitating the same material year after year.  X&Y receives 5 stars from me and my highest regards.

B0007XT87G|5.0|I love Porcupine Tree, and was incredibly excited for this next release.  And honestly, it is even better than I had anticipated.<br /><br />It is as if somewhere along the lines they decided to take all of my favorite elements in their music, then pile them together and follow it to its most musically advanced point.  Then, as if things weren't good enough, they centered it around a plotline (yes, this is a concept album, but luckily, the concept isn't in-your-face as in an Ayreon CD or something).  And just to make this album a gift straight to me, they've borrowed Opeth's frontman!  I have driven my friends insane by pointing out all of Mikael Akerfeldt's vocals and guitar solos.<br /><br />But enough about me, this album is something you'll want to listen to over and over again.  You'll hear something new each time you listen to it.  I've heard Steven Wilson talk about the contrast between horizontal and vertical complexity in his albums, and this album embodies both to the nth degree.<br /><br />In a quick rundown of the songs: the title track is this album's \\"Blackest Eyes\\"... \\"Deadwing\\" sets the mood of the album perfectly, and is very straightforward, and features a phenomenal Adrian Belew (King Crimson) guitar solo.<br /><br />\\"Shallow\\" was a great single.  It is very metal-y and obviously influenced by Wilson's work with Opeth.  Fans of PT's mellower side won't be too impressed, but it's a great song nonetheless.<br /><br />\\"Lazarus\\", the single for Germany, is my least favorite song.  It is very mellow, reminding me of \\"Trains\\" and PT's other nonedescript songs.<br /><br />\\"Halo\\" is a heavier song, a less PT-esque song, but that is in a sense MORE PT-esque, because it embodies Steven Wilson's obsession with exploring new genres of music.  The guitars in this song are fabulous.<br /><br />\\"Arriving Somewhere but not here\\" is my favorite song, hands down.  Akerfeldt is on back-up vocals, and the two voices blend beautifully.  This 12-minute opus is mostly mellow, but builds into one of the heaviest moments on the album, which melts into one of the most beautiful guitar solos I've ever hear (Akerfeldt once again).<br /><br />\\"Mellotron Scratch\\" is beautiful.  You can feel your soul drop out of your chest.  The most notable moment is towards the end when the 3/4 instrumental is overtaken by 4/4 complex vocals, and then the instruments fade to this gorgeous a capella ending.  I've replayed this ending dozens of times and it is so musically advanced even I can hardly understand it.<br /><br />\\"Open Car\\" is a good song, but nothing spectacular.  Classic PT.<br /><br />\\"Start of Something Beautiful\\" is my 2nd favorite song.  It has pounding guitars, but it isn't metal at all, really.  The melody will stay with you, but it isn't really catchy.  You thought this was the start of something beautiful, well think again...<br /><br />\\"Glass Arm Shattering\\" perfectly completes the album.  It's a mellower song, but it isn't boring at all.  The second the song ends you want to start the album over again.<br /><br />This really is a fabulous album.  I'm starting to sound like I need a thesaurus, so I'll wrap this up.  Really, I almost cried when they kept pushing back the release date on this, but it was worth every second of the wait.us is mostly mellow, but builds into one of the heaviest moments on the album, which melts into one of the most beautiful guitar solos I've ever hear (Akerfeldt once again). <br /> <br />\\"Mellotron Scratch\\" is beautiful.

B0002OERI0|5.0|FOR CRYIN OUT LOUD these guys are freakin brilliant and I dont care what anyone else thinks I still think they're awesome!!!!  To me EVERY song is unique. From the popish \\"American Idiot\\" to the long ballody \\"Jesus of Suburbia\\" its got something for everyone! But like what other people are sayin don't judge American Idiot just because of American Idiot..!!..! You know what I mean, dont judge the album cause of that song! It has much more variety to it than that. Clear vocals, face melting guitar solos, great catchy rythms, powerful drums and brilliant bass....and it all pointing to one thing....GREENDAY!!!  My personal favourites from GDs album are Jesus of Suburbia, Holiday, Boulivard of Broken Dreams, Wake Me up When September Ends and American Idiot! They're all different and all very good and catchy! Im pretty new to Greenday even though even though i've heard of them at a younger age! When I was younger I thought they were too gothic for me but now I cant get enough of them. I also knew a song from Dookie and that was Basketcase! I think its one of Greendays best songs of all time but their new songs are more about politics but still are very well written. It just goes to show that they still have some life left in them from 10 years onwards! To end this review I will say dont under estimated Greenday like I sadly did! You would've missed out on some of Greendays best albums!!! Inculding \\"Dookie\\"!!   M ^^ M 
B0007GAEW6|4.0|People seem blown away by this band because it ventures into the world of progressive.  However, I listen to prog almost exclusively, and I'm disappointed by this CD because it is so mainstream.  The \\"risk-taking\\" and \\"experimental\\" elements everyone talks about on this album, are simply 4-5 minute meandering segments that are more musical b.s. than musical genius.  Every track needs to be skipped about 3 minutes before it concludes, which has become a running inside joke between my sister and I.  Yet another song which begins akwardly and ends by drizzling into oblivion.  And don't even get me started on the way four songs are divided somewhat randomly into 12 tracks...<br /><br />But I'm being a bit too harsh.  I am a Texan here, and I should be supporting more/less local bands.  So on to the good side of the album:<br /><br />I'm very impressed that something this unique is actually this popular and seeing so much success in a mainstream market.  The music is energetic and creative, and the lyrics are very advanced.  It's a concept album, but not centralized on the idea of being a concept album, which is refreshing.<br /><br />\\"Cygnus...Vismund Cygnus\\" starts the album off very well.  Everything's set too soft, and you're drawn into trying to hear it, and then it takes off and the sound engulfs you.  It's hard to get a foothold through the first few minutes of this song, in a good way.<br /><br />\\"The Widow\\" of course was an instant hit as a single (especially with the last few minutes being chopped off for radio play, sorry...).  It's got an infectious melody and is creative without being too hard to understand musically the first time or two you hear it played.  I actually look forward to catching it on the radio sometimes.<br /><br />\\"Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore\\" is my favorite song.  It doesn't really get going until 4 or 5 minutes into it, but this song has managed to restore my faith in the musicality of trumpets in rock music.  Very cool.<br /><br />The most notable elements to make Mars Volta unique and recognizable are the extremes in dynamics, multilinguistic lyrics, abrupt pauses, being able to be dark without being heavy, and of course, akward tracklistings and the need to fast forward through minute upon minute of musical limbo.<br /><br />But still, don't take me too seriously! This album overall is very good!  Serious prog fans, don't get your hopes up too high, because this album is like some young people standing on the edge of great music, but not being able to fully realize it.  But to everyone else, this album is one of your best options for new music out there today.  I'm giving it 4 stars even, in hopes that you'll appreciate it more than I do.y cool. <br /> <br />The most notable elements to make Mars Volta unique and recognizable are the extremes in dynamics, multilinguistic lyrics, abrupt pauses, being able to be dark without being heavy, and of course, akward tracklistings and the need to fast forward through minute upon minute of musical limbo. <br /> <br />But still, don't take me too seriously!

B00004BZ16|5.0|Man, this is an incredible album.  It's best described as just a bigger version of every other record.  In terms of successes and failures, it's proportionately about the same to just an average album.  London Calling may be more consistent, but there's as many great songs on here as London Calling.  Tunes like \\"Up In Heaven\\", \\"Charlie Don't Surf\\", \\"Somebody Got Murdered\\" and \\"Sound of Sinners\\" are among some of the most earnest, well written songs I've ever heard, and I'll point \\"Up In Heaven\\" out as one of the most perfect.  \\"The Call Up\\" is just a solid, catchy, perfect song about...drafts, and \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" shows the versatility of the Clash.  Try not to dance to \\"Hitsville UK\\", \\"Look Here\\", \\"Ivan Meets GI Joe\\" or \\"Midnight Log\\".  \\"Washington Bullets\\" is another dead on reggae hit and \\"The Equaliser\\" is worth enduring for the bass line alone.  \\"Police On My Back\\" is a great cover and even the children singing \\"Career Opportunities\\" gets its point across  (it's not just another random track, it's children singing about having no futures, not a tough concept to grasp).  Around 28 to the end it is thoroughly spotty, not much redemption there, but you've already heard 27 songs!    This is not to be heard in one sitting.  It's selective.  I own it on vinyl, and maybe it's more aprecciable that way...skipping songs you don't instantly like requires at LEAST a little work that way.  But there's always something to discover here, something you haven't heard before.  Sorry if it doesn't play like their first record or London Calling, that's not really the idea.  This is a mess of dub, reggae, rock and roll, jazz, and rap, and it's your job to sift through it.  Find it on vinyl, throw on one side, grab a cold Koka Kola and just listen to the damn thing.  Don't skip anything, just listen to 6 songs at a time, you will soon understand why this is great.  You won't love everything, but I guarantee there's something here you will love.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|I'll try to keep this review short and sweet.  Bottom line: I think this is a fabulous album.<br /><br />Remember when the self-titled debut came out, and everyone thought SOAD was really weird?  And how it took a while before people really GOT the music?  And how now everything emulates that sound?<br /><br />Well, in case you've forgotten, this album will remind you of what it's like when a band really comes out with NEW material (as opposed to the same material with different lyrics and riffs).  System of a Down has highlighted the ART side of art metal with this one.  I'd even venture to call this album PROG!<br /><br />If you're looking for something to pop into your player and immediately recognize and love, jump back to Steal this Album! and pretend System of a Down has ceased to exist, because you won't really like this album, or at least half of the songs on it.  But if you're looking for some real music that you'll truly enjoy for years to come, get Mezmerize right away.  It make take a few listens through before it hits you, but this album was well worth the wait.
B0006L16N8|5.0|While a band's later albums are rarely appreciated as much as their earlier work by the public at large, true fans will tell you that the maturity that comes with age adds depth and nuance to an album (think Pearl Jam and \\"No Code\\" or U2 and \\"Beautiful Day\\").  These albums are overlooked by most people because they aren't interested in an evolving sound; they want more of \\"Alive\\" or \\"Where the Streets Have No name\\".  Hopefully that won't be the case with \\"X & Y\\" as Coldplay has brought a tremendous amount of confidence and power to this album.  While remaining true to their past, they have developed an album which is more varied musically and more sophisticated lyrically. <br /> <br />Fitting for an album whose title plays on X and Y chromosomes, the songs can be (with a few exceptions) divided up into two general themes, although they aren't arranged in any particular order.  Roughly half deal with personal growth, finding one's way and place in the world, while the others deal with finding one's place in a relationship.  In many ways they form different sides of the same coin, the internal and external and they work quite well in forming a cohesive album. <br /> <br />The album starts of with a song that will sound familiar to most fans; \\"Square One\\" is a simple, quiet song about coming to grips with success and determining what's really important in life.  Next is \\"What If\\", another relatively slow number that addresses the core question of committing to a relationship, namely what if things don't work out, what if the affection isn't reciprocated. <br /> <br />The pace changes with the amazing \\"White Shadows\\", a departure of sorts with a strongly electric guitar melody that is simply haunting.  On top of this the lyrics show a more sophisticated, enigmatic approach than previous albums.  While open to interpretation the core message is about finding one's place in the grand scheme of things as summed up in the lines \\"You're part of the human race/All of the stars and outer space/Part of the system again\\".  \\"Fix You\\" is a U2-esque number, particularly the concluding chorus, that on the surface seems to be about friendship, but I think it is informed at least in part by vocalist Chris Martin recently becoming a father.  Next is \\"Talk\\" which features a great tag line, and seems to tie together the two themes as it deals with improving relationships by improving oneself. <br /> <br />The title track, \\"X & Y\\" is a prequel of sorts to \\"What If\\" that talks about making yourself available in a relationship, of taking the chance it might not work out, that you might get hurt.  \\"Speed of Sound\\" is the first single and is along with \\"White Shadows\\" my favorite track on the album.  The lyrics are particularly beautiful and deal with looking past our modern world to find real meaning.  Following is \\"A Message\\" which is a solid track but doesn't really jump out; another relationship song that deals with staking a place for yourself while still making room for someone else.  \\"Low\\" is a fun, almost satirical song that features some nifty use of bells by the drummer and pokes fun at those who expect life to come easy.  Not a typical Coldplay song, but one that really shows how their considerations are expanding.  <br /> <br />\\"The Hardest Part\\" and \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" are two of the more enigmatic tracks.  The former deals generally with growing up, letting go, but I sense there's more to it than that.  The latter feels more like poetry and is equally open to interpretation.  Again, the open-endedness shows real development in Martin's song writing and while it may frustrate some, it is something that should be really be embraced. <br /> <br />Rounding out \\"X & Y\\" are two great songs; first is \\"Twisted Logic\\" which, while not overtly political nonetheless encourages questioning, probing, understanding and fighting for what you believe.  A great song not least because it makes its point without ramming it down the listener's throat.  Last is the \\"hidden track\\" \\"Til Kingdom Come\\"; originally written for a Johnny Cash project, it sounds every bit like something he would have done.  While a departure from anything else you've heard Coldplay do, and not really in keeping with the album, it's still an amazing song about holding out hope in a situation that may be hopeless. <br /> <br />Featuring a larger variety of guitar and drum sounds, more developed song writing and longer tracks, \\"X & Y\\" may not appeal to those who are looking for more of the same from Coldplay.  However, if you are looking for an album that represents a band in the full flush of their abilities, definitely check this one out, I guarantee it won't disappoint. <br /> <br />Jake Mohlman <br />
B0009A1AS2|5.0|So, I got back from the CD store after buying a bunch of new releases I had been dying to catch up on... The other CDs don't really matter.  This one blew them all away.<br /><br />Dream Theater isn't my favorite band, but I'd consider them the best band musically in my collection, which is almost entirely prog anyway.  Octavarium sounds a lot like Train of Thought, which may be bad news for people.  It definitely isn't straight-up metal, like some people considered TOT to be, but it has much more of a TOT sound than, say, Images & Words.  The opening track, Root of all Evil, even has a section of \\"I can feel your body breaking...\\" to almost identically the same lyrics and chord structure as in \\"This Dying Soul\\"<br /><br />...of course who hasn't known a prog band to reference their own material?<br /><br />The CD's ultimate triumph is its title track.  It is a whopping 24 minute-long opus.  And this isn't a 10-minute song followed by a long period of silence and then a bonus track.  This is 24 unbroken minutes of truly fantastic music.<br /><br />Hardcore DT fans will think this is a good \\"next link in the chain.\\"<br /><br />Casual DT fans, and any prog fans will think this is incredibly good.<br /><br />And any musician should be blown away.<br /><br />It's nothing earth-shattering, but it's as good as it possibly could be.  3 cheers and five stars for LaBrie, Petrucci, Portnoy, Myung, and Ruddess!
B0009I7NNA|5.0|WOW...the album is amazing!  thats really all their is to say about is.  It is really impossible to describe.  and anyone giving this album bad reviews because Shadows isn't screaming is just ignorant, he had surgery on his vocal chords and he can't!!  Besides i think that lack of screaming seperates the band from all the \\"new metal\\" garbage out right now.
B000929AJQ|4.0|...i think.  Well, something must have changed around the time The Fragile came out.  Perhaps my taste changed.  But I am totally off-track.  The whole point was to say that I'm definitely a fan of NIN, but not a hardcore fan in any way, shape, or form, so you can take this review for what it's worth.<br /><br />This album is very \\"normal\\" for Nine Inch Nails.  Not that it's something you'd expect from them, but something you'd expect from a more \\"normal\\" band.  That sounds very insulting, but the truth is the album is made up of all about 4:00 long songs, no instrumentals, nothing really new, except that Trent is using a band on the recording rather than recording all the tracks himself and only using a band on live performances.  Even that is more \\"normal\\".<br /><br />But with that out of the way, this is a very good album.  The tracks will hit you on emotional levels you didn't quite know you had.  The basslines will stick with you for weeks on end.  Invest in some really good speakers because the mixing on this album is phenomenal, and headphones do it a serious injustice.<br /><br />My favorite track is \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same,\\" but the CD has a sense that it would be incomplete if any of the tracks were missing. It seems to be composed of \\"Songs\\" as opposed to being one entity album at first (by one entity I mean something more like the Fragile).  But the more you listen to it, the more you see it as a complete album, abounding with synergy.<br /><br />Any concern about its relative normalcy seem to fade with each listen I give it.  It is, actually, very very good.
B00082IJ08|5.0|Before the Gorillaz - Demon Days CD came out, I heard the popular song \\"Feels Good Inc\\" on the C89.5 station and it was simply addicting!  I would keep going to yahoo.com to search for their video so I can hear that song.  Overall, this CD left me lip syncing at work and in the car. <br /> <br />When I got the CD, I didn't know how great their music sounded.  Some of the tracks took a while to grown on however the beats and guest singers are great. <br /> <br />I can't even describe their genre.  They have such a mix of rock, rap, dance, and gothic-like feel.  Some songs are chilling, upbeat, funky, and have their climatic movements.  Whatever it is, the compilation of everything makes their debut unique. <br /> <br />The best and catchy songs I thought were:  Dirty Harry, Feels Good Inc, and Dare. (Not in any particular order). <br /> <br />I'm not saying go out and buy the CD...but you've got to give this CD a chance.  I never knew its effect on me until I put it in my cd player...It's great.
B0006399FS|5.0|i'm baffled at the reviews here.   i cannot believe the low star ratings. <br /> <br />i love this album...  it is as beautiful as all other u2 records.  it is a must have for anyone who loves music.
B00005NTNM|3.0|In the first movie in this series, \\"Dirty Harry,\\" Harry Callahan (Clint Eastwood) hunted a serial killer.  In the second movie Detective Callahan went after a group of vigilante cops.  To expand the scope of those deserving of Harry's attentions, this movie adds domestic terrorists, who really are little more than glorified kidnappers and thieves.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood had fully established Harry Callahan's role by this third movie, so most viewers knew what they were getting.  However, near the beginning of the movie several vignettes are offered to show Harry Callahan in all his stylistic glory.  We see Harry kick a man who appears to be having a heart attack, admonishing him to \\"get up,\\" to the chagrin of bystanders.  We see Harry deal directly and violently with an armed group of robbers by giving them a car when they requested it.  We also see Harry try to make new detective candidates understand the real world while being typically politically incorrect.<br /><br />While Clint Eastwood is reminding fans of Dirty Harry what kind of person he is, there is a group of people who initially appear to be after some sort of \\"power to the people,\\" but are in reality being led by Bobby Maxwell to do a bit of old-fashioned murder and mayhem, with the goal being large quantities of money.<br /><br />Eventually the supposed terrorists and Dirty Harry must intersect, and that intersection is provided by an encounter between the criminals and Inspector Frank DiGiorgio (John Mitchum), Harry's most recent partner.  DiGiorgio and his new partner encounter the robbers at a warehouse containing arms, where they have already killed one man.  When the robbers critically injure DiGiorgio we know that Harry will track them down and bring them to his own unique style of justice.<br /><br />The movie drags a little while Harry is trying to locate the crooks.  During this time we are treated to Harry's own cold opinion of bumbling politicians and what might be Harry's opinion of women.  One scene to watch for is when his new partner, Inspector Kate Moore (Tyne Daly), stands behinds a LAWS rocket as it is being prepared for test firing.<br /><br />The movie speeds up again when the crooks kidnap the Mayor (John Crawford) and Harry finally determines they are on Alcatraz Island.  Callahan and Moore head out to bring the bad guys to justice and to rescue the Mayor, with the action remaining constant to the end.<br /><br />The interactions between Harry and Kate are quite interesting.  Harry has no respect for Kate initially, not because she is a woman, but because she has no experience in the field.  The movie goes out of its way to explain that Harry would treat anyone with Kate's level of experience the same way, male or female.  However, Harry begrudgingly begins to accept Kate as a partner, and by the end of the movie Harry has developed a greater respect for Kate than for the Mayor and all the other politicians in this movie.  The end scene firmly establishing that respect and is one of the rare emotionally moving scenes in the Dirty Harry series.<br /><br />I have always considered the Dirty Harry movies to be a comparison of how we sometimes perceive criminals are treated versus the way we would like to see them treated, especially considering the violence criminals perpetrate on others.  Of course, such behavior falls into the category of fanciful thought, because Harry's actions often border on being illegal, and in real life it is hard to constrain such violence to the criminals.  Still, these movies can be enjoyable to watch.<br /><br />This particular movie is dated and the pacing is slow in places.  This movie is well below the level of the original, and is a bit weaker than the second movie.  However, it remains a Dirty Harry movie, and they can be addictive.<br /><br />Several scenes in this movie are humorous or unbelievable.  When Harry leaves a government building through a metal detector he does not set it off.  When DiGiorgioand his partner approach the warehouse being robbed by the terrorists, why did DiGiorgio continue to proceed once he knew how many people were involved?  Then his partner stands in front of the crooks speeding vehicle as it bears down on him during their escape.  The Mayor's driver should have turned the limousine the opposite direction from the way he turned, and simultaneously called for help, instead of turning the way he did.  However, these implausibilities help set up the confrontation between Harry and the crooks.  Could the plotting have been more believable?  Probably, but that would have required more care in development of the plot, and apparently speed was more important than quality in this movie.hy did DiGiorgio continue to proceed once he knew how many people were involved?

B000003C2S|4.0|As a younger man,I was convinced that bands like King Diamond and Slayer were as hard and heavy as it got,but boy howdy was I wrong.From the opening riff of Living Monstrosity,Spiritual Healing had me by the throat,pummeling me over and over with sound expression and the occasional melodic breakdown.Yes it was  brutal,but Spiritual Healing introduced a wider spectrum into death metal than over indulgent satanism and mindless wizard  fantasies.Chuck wrote songs about drug addiction,mental illness,tv preachers(nudgenudge),and naziesque eugenic manipulation.Aside from the 7th grade lyrical content,Spiritual Healing is a fantastic album.Great job Chuck,great job.
B000001ELL|5.0|By the end of the 1970's,even though several Gallup polls showed that KISS was the #1 rock band in America,there was a problem in the group.The problem was that Ace Frehley and Peter Criss had started using drugs and alcohol and that the whole band was starting to hurt each other by all doing stupid things,even if it didn't have anything to do with getting arrested. Disco music still ruled the scene at the time-and after Gene Simmons,Paul Stanley,Ace Frehley,and Peter Criss had all released their self-titled solo albums,they were going to have to get together to make a new KISS record. How would the new KISS album following their solo albums turn out? Read on for my review of this: <br /> <br />This album,while it was not as good as \\"Detroyer\\" or \\"Love Gun\\",is,in my opinion,really underrated. The only problem was that KISS were trying to keep in touch with the latest style in music,and the song \\"I Was Made For Lovin' You\\" proved it,because even though it was a big hit,believe it or not,it was a little bit of both a rock song and a disco song. A really good song,and even though it was nothing close to sounding like The Bee Gees or songs like \\"Stayin' Alive\\",KISS fans did not like the idea of KISS going that different with their music. The other highlights to be found here are an excellent cover version of The Rolling Stones'\\"2000 Man\\" that Ace Frehley sung and actually did a much better job at singing it then Mick Jagger did(I like The Stones,but I've heard their version and it sounded AWFUL!!!!!!),\\"Sure Know Something\\",and \\"Magic Touch\\". The rest of this album is pretty good,it was just a big departure for KISS because not only were they recording a song that was both a rock song and a disco song,the surprising thing is that while Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley were the force behind most KISS albums(the reason why I say were is because KISS has not put out any new original albums in seven years),this time,Paul and Ace were kind of the forces behind this album. The reason for this is because not only were both Paul and Ace responsible for the songs on this record that got the most attention,Gene only contributed two tracks to this album(\\"Charisma\\" and \\"X-Ray Eyes\\")and I've read that that's not even him playing bass on \\"2,000 Man\\"-according to what Dale Sherman said in his novel \\"Black Diamond\\"(it was either book one or book two,I can't remember which)it was Ace who played bass on that track.Also,even though Ace only wrote two tracks on this album like Gene did(\\"Hard Times\\" and \\"Save Your Love\\")he sang more than of them then Gene did. As for Peter Criss,the only track that The Catman contributed to this record was \\"Dirty Livin'\\",kind of his \\"complaint\\" song where he sung about how hard his rock 'n roll life was and how he desired to get away from it. According to what Robert V. Conte said in the expanded liner notes for this album(I'll cover that later in this review)after Peter co-wrote that track(Stan Pentridge,who co-wrote \\"Beth\\" and some other KISS song with Peter and also some songs on Peter's solo album,and Vini Poncia,the producer of this album who produuced Peter's solo album and a few of his other solo records,along with producing \\"Unmasked\\" and co-writing material on \\"Hot In The Shade\\",even though he did not produce that album)co-wrote that track with Peter, and when it was recorded,Peter played drums on that track and the three other tracks that came before that(I WAS MADE FOR LOVIN' YOU,2,000 MAN,and SURE KNOW SOMETHING)but after that song(Dirty)had been recorded,Peter was dismissed from the rest of the record and Anton Fig,who would later go on to be the drummer for Frehley's Comet(Ace Frehley's post KISS band)and who would also end up playing drums on David Letterman's show,substituted for Criss on the rest of this record. <br /> <br />All of KISS' albums from 1974-1987 have been re-issued,and like I already said at the top of this review,Robert V. Conte wrote liner notes about the career of KISS around that point in time(1979) that you will find once you take the CD out of the case,and a poster that you can put up on your wall in your room that is part of the liner notes was also included. <br /> <br />Overall,a very good CD,if You're new to KISS,then this CD could quite possibly give you a wrong idea of what KISS is all about(Rock 'n Roll,not Knights In Satan's Service like some stupid and ignorant people think!)so if You're new to KISS,then start with either one of their albums that came out before this or their 2001 self-titled box set,but whenever you get it,don't forget to enjoy it and also to KISS THE RULES GOOD-BYE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br /> <br />
B000000H4A|5.0|I loved Mercyful Fate,but I had it pretty lucky.I had an older sister that introduced me to bands like KISS,Iron Maiden,and Judas Priest as well as some of the more alternative flavored music from the 80's and late 70's,but I discovered Mecyful Fate all on my own,and was disheartened when I heard they had broken up.But a year later,out came his No Presents For Christmas single,and a few months down the road,it happened..King Diamond's first solo album,Fatal Portrait.I was just eleven,but it had as much an affect on me as did the Ramones or Dead Kennedys.Fatal Portrait is one of those albums that from the beginning grabs you by the short curlies and drags you forward in such a rush of ecstasy that its hard not to tell all your friends about it the moment its over.The opener The Candle begins with spooky synthesizers and a spoken word piece that I can still remember to this day..Seven years have gone..It can no longer be left undone.So the songe begins,and so began a career of creativity that is hard to measure in impact in the metal community,whethr it be traditional or black metal you speak of.I truly enjoyed this album,and so will anyone either previously familiar with either Mercyful Fate or King Diamond,or just becoming familiar with his work.This is my favorite King Diamond album,and it still gives me goosebumps to this day when I listen to it.Some of the best songs on the album are the catchy singalong Halloween which will have you singing glass in hand,or the perfectly melancholy The Lake,not originally available on the release back in '86..And as others have said,No Presents For Christmas will instantly be any headbanger's favorite christmas tune..Every year I make a loop copy of the song on disc and sneak into my local Wal-Mart and sneakily slide it into the stereo that constantly belts out cheesy xmas music.I'm sure there's some old lady banging her head right now to King Diamond thanks to me and my yearly mission..Buy Fatal Portrait..You won't be disappointed..
B0006L16N8|3.0|X&Y is Coldplay's long awaited followup to their modern masterpiece A Rush of Blood to the Head. The moodiness of that album is on full display here as the mood of X&Y bounces between uplifting and somber throughout, sometimes during the same song. However, while their previous albums contained great tracks with memorable hooks, most notably \\"Trouble\\", \\"Clocks\\", and \\"In My Place\\", this album is inconsistent. When it's good, it's very good. When it's not, it borders on boring.<br /><br />Upon listening to this album, there appears to be more emphasis on Jon Buckland's riffs than their previous efforts. \\"Square One\\", \\"Talk\\", \\"White Shadows\\" are all great tracks driven by his guitar work and Chris Martin's vocals. Also worth noting is that Martin's piano lines aren't as memorable as in the past with only the hit single \\"Speed Of Sound\\" containing a good hook. Strings and organ are very prevalent here and work very well on \\"What If\\" and the gorgeous track \\"Fix You.\\" Other great tracks here include the catchy \\"Hardest Part\\", which sounds like the logical choice for their next single, and the majestic \\"A Message.\\" The rest of the songs are noticeably weaker as \\"Low\\" and the hidden track \\"Til Kingdom Come\\" are decent at best while \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\", \\"Twisted Logic\\", and the title track are mediocre, something you couldn't say about any of the songs on their first two albums. All told, fans of their first two albums will like X&Y but also may be hitting the skip button on some tracks, particularly those on the second half.
1573223026|4.0|In A Long Way Down, Nick Hornby writes a life-affirming novel without being life-affirming.  On New Year's Eve, four people decide independently to jump off the same building at the same time.  They soon discover that this isn't as great a coincidence as it seems because the building (Toppers' House) is notorious for attracting suicides and New Year's Eve (along with Valentine's Day) is one of the most popular nights on which to do it. <br /> <br />They all have different reasons for wanting to do themselves in.  Maureen is burdened with a teenage son who has always been in a vegetative state.  Martin - the \\"British Regis\\" - was publicly disgraced and imprisoned.  JJ is an American musician who has just lost his band and his girlfriend.  Jess is...well, too troubled to explain. <br /> <br />Once they all find themselves together, they find suicide is something that is hard to do with other people watching.  Instead, they go on a quest to find Jess's ex-boyfriend.  It gives them something to do other than kill themselves.  That's what they end up doing for each other - creating things to do other than kill themselves. <br /> <br />In the hands of a lesser writer, this could have been sappy and predictable, but Hornby writes a funny book about suicide.  Part of the problem is that, after they decide not to commit suicide, that can't think of why.  They have had no revelations.  They don't feel better about life.  They don't even LIKE each other. <br /> <br />What gives the book real forward momentum is that it is narrated in the first person by each of the four characters.  Hornby creates a distinct voice for each and alternates chapters, giving them all their say.  Things start out weird in this book and get progressively weirder, but Hornby manages to create a convincing case for toughing things out without resorting to contrived happy endings.   <br />
B000002KXV|5.0|\\"Well by '76 we'll be a.o.k\\" sings Donald Fagen on The Nightfly's opening track  I.G.Y. (International Geophysical Year). Adopting the persona of a wide eyed, optomistic adolescent in 1950's America, Fagen's beautiful lyric takes on an almost unbearable poignancy given that it was written around 1982 when Fagen (and the rest of us) knew that by '76 things definitely were not a.o.k. Still, to an upbeat yet achingly sad melody, the song's protagonist fills his heart with hope for the future where new technologies help alleviate the sufferings of mankind. \\"A Just Machine to make big decisions/Programmed by fellas with compassion and vision\\" Fagen sings, before promising \\"What a beautiful world this will be/What a glorious time to be free\\". There really is, in my opinion, no other musician around either then or now who has the depth and lightness of touch to match Fagen. The Nightfly is probably the zenith of Donald Fagen's recording career, and although a third solo studio album is planned for 2005, I doubt whether he can get close to the beauty of The Nightfly. And if he can't, no-one else stands a chance.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I have been listening to Octavarium since I got it and it is totally amazing. The songs are typical Dream Theater, they are excellent in the way they are arranged and very complex. There is one thing, you do have to let the music digest and once it does it just totally blows your mind!!!!!! I absolutely love Octavarium as well as the rest of their back catalog. Dream Theater is by far the best band that is around now. Although there are other bands that are also good, but their music just isn't as complex as Dream Theater's, and they are a totally different style of music. Dream Theater is in a musical category of it's own and no other band can or will touch them. The epic song Octavarium just totally floors you. I just can't get enough of the new album. These guys did their homework on this album. I can't wait to see them do this stuff live. Well I guess I said enough. To anyone that hasn't got Octavarium yet,pick it up you are in for a real treat!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0006L16N8|4.0|First off, people, get over hype...  Diehard fans have been looking for this for 3 years, and with all the media pressure on this band, this has been an unbelievable release...  In my opinion, Coldplay still hasn't released a song that I don't like, but all hype aside, this isn't their best recording...  Don't get me wrong, it's still awesome, but not the best...  If you've never bought a Coldplay album before, do it like this:  1. A Rush of Blood to the Head  2. Live 2003  3. Parachutes  4. X & Y  Hope this helps,  -Chris-    p.s. ON second thought, this album is totally awesome....  The songs are well thought out, and it takes a while to grow on you, but overall, this album is totally sweet...
B0000CFW87|5.0|This was the first Josh Groban cd I'd ever purchased and I am absolutely blown away. His voice, the music, the composition, everything is outstanding. There isn't one song I don't love! I've bought cd's in the past where there might have been one or two songs that I enjoyed and the rest was just fill. Not this cd. Each and every song is incredible. The lyrics, the music, his voice.... WOW! OUTSTANDING!!
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I'll say it up front - this performance wasn't quite Hell Freezes Over quality. For that reason I would have rated this 4.5 stars; unfortunately, that's not an option. Therefore, FIVE STARS will have to do. Oh yes, I missed Felder's guitar work (nasty little lawsuit there), but Steward Smith fills in very nicely. And, contrary to some reviewers, I liked how the horn section added a new layer to the groups sound. I didn't find them intrusive at all. All the guys were hitting their marks and really seemed to still enjoy what they were doing. These days, with so little out there in the way of new music for the slightly mature rock fan like myself, I'm very happy to have the opportunity to add this DVD to my concert collection. SIMPLY BRILLANT!  <br />
B0009A1AS2|4.0|A complete lack of an official review that does this album true justice has led me to take matters into my own hands. I agree with many of the other independent reviewers on this page, but there are a few other things that bear mentioning. <br /> <br />First off, the review on Allmusic is completely wrong. I don't exactly see how arena-rock-styled balladry can be mistaken for a 'post-hardcore edge', but hey. Secondly, this record is definitely not a good place to start if you're just getting into Dream Theater. I'd recommend the first album of theirs I ever heard, 'Awake', if you're looking for that. Thirdly, though the band's technical abilities are still undeniably incredible, 'Octavarium' doesn't really astound you with its craft and musicianship like DT's earlier stuff, mainly because (as it's already been said in at least one review) John Petrucci never allows himself much of a solo. <br /> <br />HOWEVER, there are plenty of awesome things to be found here. James LaBrie's voice sounds outstanding, for one thing; he has added quite a bit more depth and dimensions to his vocal style, which is a welcome surprise. Production quality is also high, and a whole range of new sounds have been incorporated into the mix, allowing for atmosphere and intrigue. The songs themselves are uniformly strong. Opener 'The Root of All Evil' seizes the listener for eight unrelenting minutes, twisting and turning with untamed rhythmic and melodic changes. 'Panic Attack' has a similar, slightly harder effect. 'Sacrificed Sons' is one of the first 'anti-Iraq' songs that has managed to affect me; it is a cunning track indeed, what with the eerie soundclips talking of 'terrorism' resounding in its first few moments. Perhaps most significant is the 24-minute title track, smartly placed at the end of the record. It is broken up into five 'movements', and each one hyperactively flickers through the styles of basically every band that's ever influenced Dream Theater. The song never loses itsfocus, which in itself is quite an achievement, considering it is nearly four times the length of the shortest song on 'Octavarium'. <br /> <br />So, my main complaints are: <br />1) that there are some dreadfully choppy moments here - specifically, the nonexistent transition between the snarling first song and the delicate balladry of the next, \\"The Answer Lies Within\\", <br /> <br />2) there are some truly icky lyrics in some of these songs - \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" would be about four times better if it didn't insist upon lapsing into clich, <br /> <br />and <br /> <br />3) Kevin Moore isn't back yet, and Jordan Rudess has a tendency to 'steal the show' from his bandmates here. <br /> <br />But still, DT have been together for 16 years, and they've really maintained their consistency throughout most of that time. To hear good progressive music in 2005 is always a delight for yours truly, and 'Octavarium' definitely delivers in that respect.
B000268QB2|4.0|Listening to the CD, I find Keane to be an extremely talented group. I was espcially impressed with the vocal ability of the lead singer. This is a CD that just makes you feel good by listening, and it is definitely worth the money. They have a unique, distinctive sound, and the CD offers songs of varying tempo. One great thing about many of the songs is how they build dramatically. Keane is a talented group that stands out in the music industry. I look forward to seeing what they offer in the future as they build as a group, because this great debut album shows their talent and promise.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Simply put, Mariah Carey is showing you how it's done with this album...\\"We Belong Together\\" has just become the biggest radio hit America has EVER seen, not to mention having the #1 album and song on the Billboard Charts..Some might think it's 1995-1996 when she repeated the trick, but no ITS 2005 AND SHE IS JUST AS BIG...Don't be fooled by haters bacause they complain when she whispers, they complain whe she hits the hig notes, and they complain because she's sold nearly 200 million albums and singles worldwide..All that at age 35...Now onto the rest of the album...Get Your Number and Say Something are dance hits, but Mine Again and Joyride really stick out on this album. Honestly this is the first Mariah album I can play completely through and be happy with. Vocally this album is strong and that's what its truly all about.
B00002EPJH|2.0|I don't like this CD because the Piano is recorded in a very bad way (sorry for my poor english): no high frequencies, no low frequencies... BAD.<br /><br />And the sweetnes of this music is so distant from energy you can feel on \\"La Scala\\" or \\"Koln Concert\\" or \\"Spheres\\" or many other marvellous Jarrett's CD.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|I bought \\"City of Evil\\" today.  I was excited about it, since I loved the majority of \\"Waking the Fallen.\\"  I understand, from reading other reviews, that M. Shadows has had vocal surgery.  Quite frankly, the fact that he doesn't scream on the album isn't what is the problem with his vocals.  It seems M. Shadows tries to do an imitation mostly of Faith No More's vocals but only a really bad job.  I agree....the singer likes to sing notes he CAN'T hit!  Don't get me wrong, this album is BEAUTIFUL musically!  EXCELLENT guitar work and very interesting classical guitar harmonies (sort of like Symphony X like another review also thought).   <br /> <br />The only thing that really brings this album down is the vocals....period.  I think that M Shadows should stick to a range of notes he can sing and not shriek.  There are moments, whether you admit it or not, that you find yourself cringing to the vocals in certain parts.  Some of the \\"yeah's\\" that Shadows does are very nice....but overall, I don't like the whininess of the singing.  Mellow is good....like in \\"I Won't See You Tonight Pt 1\\".....if they would have used that type of mellowness, then the vocals would be excellent and no need for criticism.  I wonder if they listened to the album and the vocals before they released this album? <br /> <br />I also noticed that singing had no real direction.  There aren't really any choruses that are memorable after the first listen.  M. Shadows kinda goes all over the place, not really having a set melody it seems. <br /> <br />Bottom line: Music excellent, vocals crappy.  Maybe nextime, A7X. <br /> <br />
B000286S8S|3.0|Obviously the best Van Halen formula was the original with David Lee Roth as lead singer.  Sammy Hagar is talented as well and did fine with his own Van Halen songs.  But WHY on earth would \\"the powers that be\\" include live versions of Hagar doing classic David Lee Roth songs???  What were they thinking?  \\"Jump\\", \\"Ain't talking `bout love\\", and \\"Panama\\" are live HAGAR versions.......ewww!  This collection would have been better with one disc of original Van Halen/David Lee Roth tunes and one disc of Van Hagar tunes.
B0006L16N8|3.0|I don't really care for a lot of mainstream music, but I absolutely love Coldplay.  Their first two LPs, \\"Parachutes\\" and  \\"A Rush of Blood to The Head,\\" are remarkable, with the latter verging on genius; it's definitely one of my all-time favorite albums.  Trace them back to their 3 song EP \\"Brothers & Sisters,\\" and you can hear the greatness waiting to emerge.  However, on their new album \\"X&Y,\\" they truly come up short. <br /> <br />I'm not sure what their intentions were, but this album just doesn't seem to have the heart of the first two; it just has this forced and manufactured feel.  All apologies to the Coldplay fanatics out there, but you cannot honestly say this is the same band that we heard on \\"Parachutes\\" and \\"A Rush.\\"  You can't say they've evolved either, because with evolution there is progress - there is none made here. <br /> <br />Musically, I'm baffled.  Lyrically, disappointed.  Overall it just seems canned, redundant, and empty.  No heart-pounding piano or guitar, no words that drive to the soul.  The lyrics seem so stale, in fact, that I began to get bored with the entire thing halfway through.  I heard a lot of the same words and phrases being used multiple times, which is fine if they're woven together in a clever way, but that's not the case.  Ultimately, Coldplay turned in their most unimpressive work, yet will likely garner their most impressive sales.  Maybe that was the plan all along... <br /> <br />There is, however, one bright spot to this grim story:  the unnumbered track, \\"Kingdom Come,\\" is brilliant.  Sadly, this is the only glimpse we get of an honest song.
B0006399FS|5.0|I've had this album since it came out in the fall, and i still love it. I cant say theres any songs i skip over on it. Though their music is still as good as in the 80's, its in a different way. I think now its a little less epic and a little more personal now that they are older. Almost all the songs could be singles but still manage to have substance to them.
B00005JMYI|5.0|One of the single greatest movies ever made. In my book this movie should have won several oscars including Best Picture, best actor (Will Ferrell), and Steve Carell hands down should have won best supporting actor for playing everyone's favorite weatherman (take that Al Roker) Brick Tamland,who likes to eat ice cream and really enjoys a nice pair of slacks. Years later, a doctor will tell him that he has an I.Q. of 48 and am what some people call mentally retarded.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This is definatly one of the best CDs i have ever heard. I must admit though, at first i was not really too pleased with the \\"new sound.\\" I found the parts that they actually played enjoyable, but then that drifted into random guitar noises, or some sort of noise. But, then I listened to it, more, and more and now I cant imagine how i ever disliked it. Here is my opinion on the songs: <br /> <br />Cygnus....Vismund Cygnus (5/5): This song is a great way to start off the album. With the soft beginning, which explodes into spanish, and rock guitars, it is just perfect.  <br /> <br />The Widow (3/5): This is the single, and i find it ok, but definately not up to par with the rest of the cd. If your new to the Mars Volta, this might be one of your favorites, but as time goes on im sure youll start appreciating the other tracks more. <br /> <br />L' Via L' Viaquez (4/5): I think most people would rate this song higher, but the sound the guitar has just really bugs me. It sounds like a generic rock guitar sound, and i have found the mars volta to be anything but \\"generic.\\" But, especially in the slow parts, this song still shines. <br /> <br />Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore (5/5): Definatly the best slow song on the CD. I usually skip the many minutes of silence at the beginning, until the trumpet comes in. This song is great in showing off Cedric's vocal, and after the buildup it is truly amazing. <br /> <br />Cassandra Geminni (6/5): WOW! One of my favorite songs of all time. The best song on the CD, it is very hard to describe, do to its length, so you will just have to check it out for yourself. <br /> <br />Overall, this album totally rocks. Comparing it to Deloused, i really couldnt make a decision. They are both different, and they both are extremely good. If this is your first Mars Volta cd, id say pick up Deloused first, because its more upbeat, and easier to get into. Some other bands to check out are; Dredg, Radiohead, At the Drive-In, and Tool. <br/>
B00004T9UF|1.0|This may be one of the worst albums ever made, eminem is a horrible rapper, actor, person, and anything else he has ever attempted. All eminem does is rap and call his mom a b****. He tries to act tought even though he is afraid of Triumph the Insult Comic Dog, who is a puppet. <br /> <br />One star is way too much for this album, why can't amazon allow me to give this \\"album\\" zero stars.
B000929AJQ|5.0|I've been a fan of NIN since I was 13 years old and I still love thier music. Even after the long yearly delay, Trent R. has still made my ears happy. NIN's newest CD With Teeth still has the hardcore sound the previous songs have had before, no matter what anyone says. I even met a woman who looked like she was in her 60s who loves listening to NIN, she said she listens to this CD in her car everyday.
0385659806|4.0|When I first picked up the book The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time I was expecting a novel involving some suburban wife and her affair. I was pleasantly surprised when there was hardly a mention of a middle aged housewife and her troubles and tribulations. Instead I got a wonderfully written novel about the world of an autistic boy named Christopher Boone. Though this book has the basis of a coming-of-age story, it is told in a refreshing new set of eyes where the boy is not miserable and locked away but simply different. I personally am tired of the underdog story laden down with a heavy coat of depression so this was a cheery alternative with the same idea all the while though making me think about my own logic. I highly recommend this novel if your in the mood for a nice, uplifting paperback with a bit of a twist.
B000000OAA|5.0|A big turning point came for Queen with the release of Sheer Heart Attack, eventually leading them to superstardom with the follow up to this effort with A Night At The Opera. A more sophisticated approach compared to the 2 previous albums(both great by the way), Sheer Heart Attack works so well in so many aspects. The musicality to begin with reaches a new level on this album, with the band finding numerous diverse songs ranging from tongue and cheek pop joy, to short metal powerhouses, to 2 part lyrical choir-like melodies.<br /><br />An achievement that deserves enormous acclaim but will never get the full on respect it deserves, Sheer Heart Attack balances the songwriting differentials of the 4 members of Queen so well. As always, Queen finds a way to begin the album with a most intriguing tune, in this case coming from the energetic fiesta of Brighton Rock. Brian May seems to simply be the king of writing the perfect album opener, as he has done so on several other albums with the likes of songs such as Keep Yourself Alive, Father To Son, We Will Rock You and Tie Your Mother Down respectively. The insatiable, glorious melody of Killer Queen makes for some outstanding listening, with Freddie shining on lyrical deliveries, almost sounding as if he's obsessed with the song itself. Roger Taylor shows that he continues to improve his songwriting skills, this time unleashing onto us Tenement Funster, a great rocker indeed. Very similar to I'm In Love With My Car, Taylor offers exceptional drums to go along with the raspy lyrical delivery. Flick Of The Wrist has an incredible piano introduction, breaking into another rocker, with dark lyrical passion to begin the song. The chorus has a sing-a-long feel to it, accompanied by classic guitar riffs from Brian May. Lily Of The Valley has a deep emotional aspect to it, with Freddie Mercury singing in his most melodic tone of voice in this superb ballad. Now I'm Here is quite simply an ultimate rock classic, featuring a smashing introduction into a fiery rock track. In The Lap Of The Gods is a beautiful song, with background harmonies worked so effectively with tremendous production. It is mind boggling to think that Queen were able to produce the kind of work they did in the 70s without the use of synthesizer machinery. Stone Cold Crazy follows this up nicely, forcing down speedy guitar riffs into your ears with Mercury at top speed on the lyrics. A fast action metal song with an awesome chorus and a very smooth guitar solo coming in about 40 seconds through the song. Dear Friends, a rather simple song, short and well executed. Misfire sees John Deacon take his shots as a songwriter, contributing a rather effective pop song, however falling short when looked upon against the track listing. Bring Back That Leroy Brown was most likely an experimental song, working very well, and branching out on A Night At The Opera, maybe influencing Mercury to write songs like Seaside Rendezvous and Lazing On A Sunday Afternoon. The chorus is catchy and repetitive. She Makes Me, has a very smooth electric guitar strum, but falls short lyrically. Nevertheless, finds its place amongst the group of songs. In The Lap Of The Gods...Revisted has a more balladic feel to it at the beginning than the original, and is a completely different song. However, offers rock phases throughout the second half, backed up very nicely by the ensemble singing. The remix of Stone Cold Crazy doesn't offer the listener enough of a variation.<br /><br />Overall, although I'm writing this review after listening to the album only three times, I would be truthful to say this is my favourite Queen album. A great deal of diversity, complexity and balance in the album makes it an instant success, offering Queen fans with a piece of all the styles(all original) that made this group sensational. On top of this album, I highly recommend Queen's other 70s works, specifically Queen I and II, A Night At The Opera and A Day At The Races. I've heard good things about News Of The World and Jazz but don't own them myself. I can't understand why their classic albums don't receive classic treatment. Well, I guess it's understandable. They're Queen.hings about News Of The World and Jazz but don't own them myself. I can't understand why their classic albums don't receive classic treatment. Well, I guess it's understandable. They're Queen.

B0000DJZB9|4.0|A nice summary of what GNR did with their music videos back when they were together as a band producing rocking tunes, Welcome To The Videos has the classic videos that sent GNR on top of the world as stars, and also their Use Your Illusion videos, some of which in a sense depict their decline in popularity.<br /><br />Obviously Welcome To The Jungle, Sweet Child and Paradise City are all classic. Patience may be the ultimate video in this set, with the great shots of Slash strumming the guitar, and Axl swaying back in forth for his classic lyrical deliveries. Now let's take a look at our Illusion videos. It really is a crying shame that they were blown apart from criticism with these truly incredible releases, but at least the music is still alive. As for the videos from that era, they weren't all that great. For example November Rain, although as sensational a song it is, is criticized for being a corny video, and I wouldn't disagree. Garden Of Eden is also a waste of time with the video, a good screecher, but with little work gone into the video itself. Don't overlook the DVD though, featuring the classic Estranged, a very heart felt song, moving in so many aspects. Knockin' On Heaven's Door could've been better, but Live And Let Die certainly marks the spot as does The Garden and Don't Cry.<br /><br />In summary, the videos are fairly strong, however, in a sense this is a troubling release for the fact that as a viewer, you're forced to rely on each and every video to be classic due to the lack of content. Extras definitely should've filled up a seperate disc with interviews, and maybe some live excerpts to treat fans. Overall, recommended to diehards for purchase, and it should be rented by other GNR fans or rock n' roll lovers.
B0006L16N8|5.0|There have plenty of reviewers of this album that want their \\"Old Coldplay\\" back. They want Parachutes or ROBTTH. Lots of piano, quiet, moody songs. Some of Parachutes was so quiet you could barely hear it! This is NOT the same album done a third time (neither was ROBTTH). This is Coldplay moving forward. It is a more rocking record with a richer, full sound. Put earphones on and your head will spin upon first listen! But after a few plays all the way through the songs begin to sink in and mean something more. I feel this is Coldplay's Sargent Pepper (not blasphemy, I hope). All the songs feel connected, and I hear a lot of love songs here. Inspired by GP? Who knows, they are beautiful. Coldplay has gotten a lot of flak in reviews so far but the fans know what they like. It's a wonderful CD.
B00097A5HW|5.0|Shakira has done it again! The reason she takes so long to have a new album out every time is because she takes the time to print her own personal style and feelings into every song. The fact that she duets with Cerati and Alejandro Sanz makes it even greater considering they are of wide acclaim and talent in the latin music world.  <br /> <br />It is not your all around same album, each song has a different sound and feeling making it  very unique . <br /> <br /> If what u planned to get was something equal to any of the other album then you`re gonna be dissapointed because Shakira`s more than that....she creates as artists do. I reccomend it 100%.
B00008H2LB|1.0|I can't for the life of me understand why people listen to this band. No talent whatsoever. Avoid this.
B00005JMEW|4.0|<br />meets low budget Kung Fu meets splatter film meets... <br /> <br />You get the idea.  Tarrantino uses every film technique in existence along with animated segments, black and white segments, references to old TV shows (sound track from the television show \\"Ironsides\\" used as a sound effect), and practically every cheesy cult genre of film is skewered repeatedly and with great humor.   <br /> <br />That's the key here, folks.  This is a COMEDY - if you take this movie seriously you deserve the seven alarm heartburn that will ensue.  This is Tarrentino's big F-U to the people that kept whining that he wasn't making enough movies - and when he did - that they weren't as good as Pulp Fiction.  Complaining about this movie being bad is like complaining that the old Batman TV series wasn't \\"true\\" to the comic book - this movie is meant to be camp taken to an extreme.  It's an anime cartoon brought to life.  On that level, it's an unqualified success. <br /> <br />If you saw this film and didn't laugh out loud at least once, you have a PROBLEM, period.
B00097A5HW|1.0|I am sorry, but this is the WORST EVER Cd she has ever released in her career. I am so DISAPPOINTED in her.

B00097A5I6|2.0|Once again - dissapointed I'm afraid! I hate to say it cos I love(d) Oasis. <br /> <br />This album is too cheesy, too clompy (whatever that means!!!) and not what a top band should be producing. Lyla?!? Its so crap I cant believe it! Oasis are going through the motions and not moving very well at all.  <br /> <br />The Lennon influence on the vocals is extremely annoying (nothing against Lennon of course - I just hate the copied delivery) - what happened to the angry lead vocalist in Morning Glory? What the hell happened to songs like Some Might Say, Cast No Shadow...  <br /> <br />Oasis are still on the shelf way after their sell-by-date. I hate to say this!!! <br /> <br />The live tour will no doubt be fantastic - thats only cos of the classics. <br /> <br />Coldplay have royally kicked their ass with X & Y.
B0006L16N8|3.0|I'd hate to think that, if the news reports are right, this is the album that Capitol Records -- the home of The Beatles, the classic Beach Boys, Sinatra in his Nelson Riddle days, Dean Martin, Louis Prima, Esquerita, the early Pink Floyd, Nancy Wilson, Duran Duran and the comeback-era Tina Turner -- is relying on to stay financially afloat. What does that say about the current state of pop music?  Look -- this is not a slam of Coldplay. The guys are good for what they are: a young group of musicians who play inoffensive, dreamy, cleanly produced pop music clearly geared for a mass market in a conservative time in our history. But what's the main difference between this act and the ones mentioned above? All the artists mentioned above were originals. Originals.  What I hear here is a group oft compared to the tamest elements of U2 (and Brian Eno contributes to the ninth track, \\"Low\\"), but with a singer who sounds like Sting more often than he does Bono. I hear a couple of faster-tempo tracks that would probably have been in medium rotation on a mid-'80s \\"alternative\\" radio station. I also hear elements of later, more ethereal Beatles, and even a touch of Floyd. But I don't hear a single thing that says \\"original.\\" It's a well-crafted disc, but I hear much more craft than passion. Pretty much it's what I heard from them in the past as well. And I don't hear much that qualifies them as rock.  I don't hear any saviors here. All I hear is a pleasant quartet that made a pleasant album and will make a pretty penny for its record label for maybe another album or two, then be discarded when the sheep turn to other pastures. Maybe the folks at Capitol should start trying to find an act that's (here's that word again) original.
B0006L16N8|2.0|a rush of blood to the head is a classic album and easily the best release this decade, imo by any band. that's pretty hard to live up to, apparently even for coldplay. i've sat in my car every drive for the last 2 days really hoping for these songs to grow but i'm getting bored with it. in fact boring is a perfect word for this album. where is the energy and wow factor i was hit with when i first heard a rush of blood or parachutes? hell speed of sound is the best song on here and i dare you to hum it without going into clocks. fair enough to coldplay cause clocks is a great song, but it's little brother shouldn't be the best song on this album. if you like the album than that's great cause i really wish i could. the idea that there's no way you can dislike this album if you like the first two is one of the dumbest statements i've read.
B0000640VO|5.0|This is my all-time favorite from Jean-Pierre Jeunet.  Colorful masterpiece.  I can't praise this enough!  You'll fall in love with  this film!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Simply put, the political messages on Green Day's \\"American Idiot\\" are desperately needed by more mainstream artists and punk rock artists alike. The United States is facing the real threat of becoming a Fascist state, while the masses enjoy lazy sunbathing. The songs \\"American Idiot\\" and \\"Holiday\\" say what needs to be said, while the rest of the record speaks of the desperation and alienation of the kids growing up in suburban, modern America.<br /><br />I'd say this record, while not totally punk, still exudes the punk spirit in every way and is a landmark accomplishment by Green Day. Buy it and live it.
B00005ASHM|5.0|Of course you don't understand Pet Sounds, Turtleman. You identified more with the buzz of the circular saw you attempted to review. Pet Sounds is not the buzz of a circular saw.<br /><br />If you were blown away the first time you heard the tapestry of harmonies on \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\", \\"God Only Knows\\", and \\"Sloop John B\\" - you are gonna love Pet Sounds.<br /><br />It holds up very well for a 1966 rock & roll album. The songs are extremely well written, the arrangements are spotless, the Beach Boys have never sung better, and the production isn't hampered by the cliche fuzztone, sitar, and feedback excesses that would mire so many of their contemporaries deep in the psychedelic '60s.<br /><br />As for The Beatles vs The Beach Boys battle . . . None of The Beach Boys had the razor edge of John Lennon's vocals . . . but, even at their best (\\"Because\\" or \\"Sun King\\") the Beatles could never quite match the harmony arrangements of Brian Wilson.<br /><br />What is interesting is that it took Lennon, McCartney, and George Martin's combined efforts to accomplish in the studio what Brian Wilson was creating as writer, arranger, and producer.<br /><br />No, forty years doesn't seem to have diminished the incredible accomplishments of either band. The Beatles will always be the standard by which every band who follows is measured - and Beach Boys' music will always be to summer what Christmas carols are to winter.
0553213105|5.0|It is not for nothing that this book is labelled as a classic.  Austen is the greatest writer of this type of fiction and this is her crowning glory.<br /><br />Coming from the world of high society in England of the late 18th Century, Austen lived the life she wrote about.  Having refused a compromise proposal of marriage herself, and lived out her life as a spinster, she was only too aware of the realities of the marriage game.<br /><br />Women in this society were marketable product, and both men and women were stratified by their annual income.  A titled person or someone from a noble family might improve flagging fortunes by marrying untitled money, but in general money married money and titles married titles.<br /><br />Into this delicate balance Austen throws her heroine - Eliza Bennett.  In any \\"proper\\" romance novel it should be the passionless and tame courtship of her older sister Jane to the wealthy Bingley and his bitchy sisters that should form the core of the story.<br /><br />Eliza opens the novel by turning down a proposal from an embarrasing, boring, unhandsome relative who has a modest income as a churchman.  To society this would have been a proper match for Eliza and it is unthinkable that she should refuse it.<br /><br />But Austen opts to sell a true fairytale and in doing so established a modus operandi for much modern fiction.  Eliza and Darcy begin by getting off on the wrong foot.  The remainder of the novel is an Anabasis from the confused territory of mistaken assumptions and impressions to an epiphany of understanding and mutual respect.<br /><br />On either side of this love story are the very proper courtship of Jane and Bingley on one hand, and the dreadful elopement of a younger sister with a complete cad on the other.<br /><br />The prize at the end is not just Darcy, but his wonderful estate of Pemberly, thoroughly described in the novel.  The reward for the characters is access to this estate (invitations to balls, summers holidays etc) and the virtuous are awarded open access while those who behaved badly are excluded and sent to parts of England furthest from Pemberly.<br /><br />The beauty of this story lies in the wit of conversation and letter.  The cutting comments, the razor sharp assesments of character.  The constant referral to income, house size, education and marriage prospects.  It is here that Austen really excels, and to appreciate just how funny the novel is requires the attention of the reader to what is being said.  Careful attention to the language carries a huge reward and I frequenly found myself collapsing in laughter while reading this book.<br /><br />I am not a fan of romance or of regency fiction, but I am a fan of this book.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|First off, I'm a huge Dream Theater fan.  After listening to this album, I can't really say that I'm all that surprised.  DT seem to have a tendency to branch out in different directions sometimes.  This is definitely one of those steps. <br /> <br />One noticeable difference is that John does not let it rip on this record.  I like the times when he does.  Sure, he has the occasional flare on this album, but it feels a little different.  I miss that on this album.  Perhaps he put all of the good stuff on his solo album, Suspended Animation, which was released in March.  By the way, the solo album is fantastic for those who are interested in his work.  I'm assuming a large majority of DT fans are.  You can purchase it through his website. <br /> <br />Octavarium is a good cd.  I find it difficult to say that DT could make a bad record.  However, I do feel like it is a step down from Train of Thought, which, to my surprise, ended up being on of my favorite DT albums. <br /> <br />I'm sure this one will grow on me more over time.  But, it's definitely not their best work.
044024157X|1.0|John Grisham is usually a guarantee for a page-turning read. This, however, is the signal for me to stop buying his books. It kicks off well, then just completely loses focus and direction and prattles on endlessly about this and that and nothing of interest - I have the feeling this is Grisham's attempt at writing himself an \\"Epic\\", and he fails miserably. As for the oh-so-perfect Miss Millie (or whatever her name was), I just felt like pouring one of her oh-so-perfect pot roasts over her head and telling her that her oh-so-perfect, 7 PhD'd kids (yeah, right) bore me to tears. I have to agree with Dr. Ansari  - by the time the books starts \\"revealing all\\", you just don't care anymore. Nausea, Grisham style.
B00005BL2A|5.0|From the initial release of \\"Speak & Spell\\" I have been a devoted fan of the Mode. Without going on too much, just know that I have everything they have ever released domestically on vinyl, CD and video. As a former club DJ in the 80's, I wore them out! As an avid music fan they have never disappointed. Even so, I don't dish out 5-stars very freely.    The strength of Depeche is their ability to communicate musically something new and fresh with each release, while maintaining a theme. Each album offers up a new concept with continuity from track to track. They reinvent themselves without losing that personalized thread of creativity that makes them so darn cool. Very few artists are able to pull this off.     Nonetheless, I know Depeche has wielded their way into the hearts of America by consistently delivering the quintessential head-bobbing-pop-fare in their indisputably unique style. However, what Depeche delivers on \\"Exciter\\" is exciting in a different way. They offer up a more mature, relaxed sound. This recording is opulent and emotional. I don't believe that true Depeche fans are the ones expressing disappointed about this, because these factors are exactly what separates this group from the rest of the electronic-keyboard-based bands. The negativity is from those immature psuedo-fans who thrive on the tunes that have allowed D.M. their commercial success. Though \\"Freelove\\" is as awesome of an offering to appease the monsters as, \\"People Are People\\"... This is not an album recorded to persue commercial-pop success.     The alternative, as I see it... They could have maintained Vince Clark and continued to sound just as they did on on their first release, \\"Speak & Spell\\", which was consistently high-energy and fun, but augh! Mr. Clark found an outlet for that as \\"Erasure\\", and aren't we all a little tired of middle-aged men churning out nothing but synthesized high-energy disco? I am. Martin Gore on the other hand is a song writing genius who does not rely onformula and that's in part why...  \\"Exciter\\" is my absolute favorite D.M. release to date.     I won't review the songs because who wants to trudge through me describing how awesome each and every track is? My only disappointment is with \\"Comatose\\", which is comparatively weak. Growing up with Depeche Mode is one of life's special treasured little pleasures. Please,let them grow up as well. This  release of smooth, mature, emotionally-charged tranquility is,...exciting.
0788815490|5.0|Watching The Wings of the Dove on dvd after years of not seeing it, I felt as though I were watching a completely new movie - the ravishing cinematography of Eduardo Serra makes this a completely new experience from its video transfer that I first saw.  The rain-strewn canals of Venice seem to have never looked so vivid, romantic, and - cineastes beware - symmetrical.  This becomes so eye-catching because despite amazing Merchant-Ivory productions, the turn-of-the-century class-romance conflict has never been made like it is here.  That's because beneath its struggle between desire and social mores is two fully vivid women whose characterizations embody the full depths and aspirations of humanity (not to a mention a deliciously misanthropic turn by Charlotte Rampling as icy Aunt Maude).  Alison Elliot never quite got the credit she deserved for matching Milly's rapaciousness towards life with her rapaciousness towards Martin - and Kate.  And Helena Bonham Carter gives equal parts sizzle and sympathy to the almost totally sympathy-less Kate, who, at her center, is a fairly vile manipulator.  The fact that the movie could have such romantic force despite our very human reservations towards what's going on onscreen is a testament to the full gradations of life Iain Sotley and Hossein Amini bring to Henry James's novel - and it makes this thick British drama a pulsating force.
B0006L16N8|2.0|Coldplay doesn't evolve on this album.  Rather, it sounds like an attempt at greatness that went awry.  The sound is bloated, overly U2-ish, and ultimately, it doesn't sound like Coldplay.  In other words, they strayed too far from their musical identity.
B000002IMG|5.0|\\"The New Order\\" has always been my favorite Testament album which came out in 1988 which was one year later after they released their 1987 debut \\"The Legacy\\" which was a classic as well, but this album however is much better, and it's also Testament's best album as well as I might add. It is simply an absolute classic and it's definitely one of the best Thrash Metal albums of the 80's as well. Words just can't even describe how amazing this album is. It just rips and shreds like a beast, it is really amazing. Musically, \\"The New Order\\" is a bit more melodic, complex, and very technical, and the songwriting is also better than on the first album as well. The production which is handled by Alex Perialas is also great too, while not being too polished, but not under produced whatsoever. Chuck Billy is a very talented and skilled vocalist whose style ranges from wicked high piercing screams to gruff, aggressive low growls that will make your bones quiver. The guitar work here is just fantastic as rhythm guitarist Eric Peterson anchors and drives the songs here with heavy, fast, brutal, violent riffs, while lead axeman Alex Skolnick steals the show throughout with his share of excellent riffing and let's not forget about his amazing, wailing, amp-shredding solos as well. He is truly one of Thrash Metal's best lead shredders in my opinion, no questions asked. Greg Christian's bass notes are good and audible on occasion, and Louie Clemente's drumming is just rock solid throughout.<br /><br />\\"The New Order\\" is just chock full of classic Testament songs. Every song on here is a winner in my book. Track one \\"Eerie Inhabitants\\" begins with some eerie, spacey acoustic notes followed by some awesome melodic lead guitar work until the song propells into an angry, thrashing foot stomping beat and blistering riffage, and there's also a lenghty, killer, melodic yet winding, wailing solo from Alex. \\"The New Order\\" is another stomping thrasher, as well as my favorite song on here which opens with some furious lead guitar shredding backed up by some heavy intro riffs, and then segues into another pounding, stomping thrash onslaught which also includes another killer, wailing solo by Alex. The chorus in this song is also awesome as well. \\"Trial By Fire\\" is another one of my favorite Testament songs that starts off with some more awesome melodic soloing and then shifts into a barrage of grinding, thrashing riff and stomping drums, and we're treated yet again with another awesome, wailing, shredding Alex solo. Next up, we have \\"Into the Pit\\" which is another one of Testament's best known songs, and an all out blistering, bruising, and blazing thrasher highlighted by an array of angry, aggressive vocals, blistering riffs, blazing soloing, pounding beats, and a mosh pit-worthy chorus. \\"Hypnosis\\" is a cool 2 minute instrumental interlude which features a nice blend of dark, eerie acoustic plucking and haunting lead guitar work, meanwhile \\"Disciples of the Watch\\" is yet another classic Testament song as well as a wicked speedy bruiser highlighted by ripping, blistering riffs, thumping, pounding beats, and another awesome solo by Alex. Next, we have yet another classic highlight \\"The Preacher\\" which is another one of my favorite Testament songs that is highlighted by amazing vocal work from Chuck including some wicked high piercing screams, and then we have a fantastic cover of Aerosmith's \\"Nobody's Fault\\" which is followed by \\"A Day of Reckoning\\", and the 4 minute closing instrumental piece \\"Musical Death (A Dirge)\\" which features some terrific and beautiful acoustic picking as well as a beautiful melodic solo.<br /><br />So in conclusion, \\"The New Order\\" is definitely an essential listen for any serious Thrash Metal fan or Metal in general. I highly recommend this album along with \\"The Legacy\\" and \\"Practice What You Preach\\" especially if you're new to Testament. Believe me, this is one of the absolute best Thrash Metal albums ever, no questions asked...Buy it now!!!<br /><br />HORNS UP!!!..Buy it now!!!<br /><br />HORNS UP!!!
B000068OSK|4.0|The White Stripes are a band that I listen to in amazement every time I put one of their albums in my CD player. I also hardly ever sing along to their music because I want to listen so intensely to everything that's going on in each song. The drums and guitar are the principal instruments of the Stripes' music and represent a back-to-basics approach to how rock music *was* made 30 years ago and, supposedly, how it should *still* be being made. Their self-titled 1999 debut album was released without much fanfare and passed by without selling anything. When the band broke through to international attention with 2001's \\"White Blood Cells,\\" this debut album was re-issued, re-packaged, and re-released and sold thousands.<br /><br />As far as raw and rough rock music goes, this debut album has it in abundance. This is probably the heaviest album from The White Stripes, but it never seems like a chore to get through it because of the heavy melodies and the wonderful arrangements. Jack White is in the early development stages of realising his true potential, and Meg White is the perfect counterpart. It's hard to believe this album was recorded in 1999, because it sounds so much older! This isn't a bad thing, though, it's quite refreshing and amazing in today's music scene.<br /><br />The album opens with the stunning \\"Jimmy The Exploder.\\" With a heavy guitar and clunking drum pieces, this song will have you jumping around from the moment it starts! Jack's vocals are on fire and you just feel like shaking your head to his \\"Woo! Woo! Woo!\\"-ing! \\"Stop Breaking Down\\" is a brilliant cover version. The beat is heavy, vocals are strong and the guitar is crazy. \\"The Big Three Killed My Baby\\" has a sharp, stabbing noise to begin with, followed by some crazy drum beats. Meg pounds on that kit like no tomorrow! Jack is literally screaming his lyrics here, but it's so irresistible. \\"Suzy Lee\\" is a softer, more gentler song but builds up in the choruses. \\"Sugar Never Tasted So Good\\" is a welcome change from the incredible, but repetitive, heavy guitars and drums. It's quite a lovely song which is followed by the crazy \\"Wasting My Time.\\" The vocals on this song are very good and I like the way the guitars breaks things up nicely into softer and harder sections. \\"Cannon\\" is more hard rock with lots of whooping and undulating drum loops. \\"Astro\\" is definitely one of the best songs on the whole album with guitar licks that will dance around in your head for days on end. The drum kit keeps constant in the background as the guitar climbs, stalls and continues with it. \\"Broken Bricks\\" is so heavy you'd mistake it for a crate of bricks falling onto your head! Short and swift, it starts and ends before you know it, but leaves one Hell of an impression.<br /><br />\\"When I Hear My Name\\" has lots of \\"whoa-oah-whoa-oaa!\\"-ing going on in it. The guitar rips this song apart and the drum kit is always there in the background. \\"Do\\" is a softer song about being hated by people for no apparent reason, and knowing there's nothing you can do about it! \\"Screwdriver\\" has a very intense vocal delivery from Jack, and the guitars seem to have come straight outta Hell. \\"One More Cup Of Coffee\\" is a brilliant cover version of the Bob Dylan original with some great harmonious instruments in the background. This is different to much of the rest of the album. \\"Little People\\" has a strange noise in the background that keeps your attention. It sounds like a whale under the sea to me. A lot of people dislike this song, but I think it's great - it builds up tension! \\"Slicker Drips\\" runs for just 90 seconds and isn't really a favourite of mine. \\"St. James Infirmary Rules\\" is pure old-school blues right here, and we're talking 1930's here, not even Sixties! There's something very silent-movie about this song and the piano is a wonderful addition: a sign of things to come. The album closes with \\"I Fought Piranhas.\\" This song takes the slide guitar of Suzy Lee which adds a very Western, deserted sound to the song.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 8/10<br /><br />This album is far from being the best one from The White Stripes. In fact I'd probably say it's my least favourite of all five of their albums, but it was their debut and was simply a platform from which they could ascend to higher levels of brilliance. Okay, so this album didn't change the world, but their later stuff bloody did. This album is slightly one-dimensional and after a while the drums and electric guitars can get slightly tedious. This makes the album seem a lot longer than it's actual 43 minutes. If you're just getting into this incredible band, I'd begin with their more recent stuff such as \\"Elephant\\" and \\"Get Behind Me Satan.\\" Then I'd move onto their older material to see how they progressed over time.song.

B0000D96NW|5.0|After being nearly written off, Machine Head return with their brand new album Through The Ashes Of Empires which was realeased in Europe back in 2003, and released here in the states last year. This album is without a doubt, Machine Head's best material since the 1994 classic Burn My Eyes. The opening track \\"Imperium\\" kicks this album off with a bang. When I first heard this song, I was immediately hooked. Not only does this song show how much the band have gotten back to their roots, but it's a defiant declaration of personal growth. Other great standouts include Days Turn Blue To Grey, Bite The Bullet, Vim, Elegy, Seasons Wither, and Descend The Shades Of Night. The other songs are good but those I listed are my favorites. This album also has great vocals from Robb Flynn, awesome guitar solos from Phil Demmel, good bass lines from Adam Duce, and excellent drumming by Dave McClain. Anyways if you're into Machine Head or metal in general, Through The Ashes Of Empires is yours to enjoy. ALL HAIL MACHINE HEAD! 5 stars<br /><br />themetalbeast's ratings:<br /><br />1. Imperium: 10/5 (My favorite song on here)<br /><br />2. Bite The Bullet: 5/5<br /><br />3. Left Unfinished: 5/5<br /><br />4. Elegy: 5/5<br /><br />5.

B000002MTR|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers, a band that means so much to me. I've only been listening to their music as a fan for the past two and a half years, since I bought \\"By The Way\\" in January 2003, but in that time they have easily become my all-time favourite band. There's something about the music they make, coupled with Anthony Kiedis' voice that sends me to a special place. I know this might sound stupid, but I used to listen to their albums when I played Grand Theft Auto on my PlayStation 2, and I think something about that combination of music with something visual brought out the true beauty of the music. Yeah, it sounds strange, that a video game would make me realise this.<br /><br />Four years had passed from 1991's breakthrough classic \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\" and 1995's \\"One Hot Minute.\\" The popularity of the band had waned somewhat, but the expectation for new material was still very high. John Frusciante had departed the band in between the release of both these albums, and Jane's Addiction guitarist Dave Navarro stepped up to fill his shoes. Fans were a bit disappointed, which has resulted in this album receiving harsh reviews. I personally really like this album. It's different to their other albums, which is not always a bad thing: variety is what keeps a band fresh. Navarro left the band in 1997 after \\"creative differences,\\" and I'll be the first to admit it was better when John came back for 1999's \\"Californication.\\"<br /><br />The album opens with the heavy rock anthem \\"Warped.\\" This song begins as though it is miles away with a drum beat travelling faster and faster to your ears. Kiedis' vocals are warped to give a distorted effect before the guitars and drums storm in after 46 seconds. The beat in this track is so heavy and travels like a tidal wave through the entire length of the song. The chorus is powerful and makes for a great driving anthem! \\"Aeroplane\\" is the album's lead single and one of the best songs that they have ever done! The tranquil intro soon turns into a VERY funky piece of rock. The guitar in this song is amazing and although the lyrics are rather meaningless, Kiedis' vocal delivery is beautiful. \\"Deep Kick\\" is the longest song on the album, and begins with a very long spoken intro. It's a poem really, and I think it works quite well. I'm just not too fond of the actual song once the music kicks in. \\"My Friends\\" is a beautiful ballad. Anthony serves up a very nice vocal delivery here, with the band harmonising to great effect. The song is quite sad and emotional as Kiedis' sings about how much his friends mean to him.<br /><br />\\"Coffee Shop\\" is quite a short song that a lot of people hate. However, I adore it, I can't get enough! Yes, it's a bit outrageous and crazy, but that's what makes it so wonderful. Kiedis' vocals are just hilarious on this track, and the way they change at the end of each line has me in giggles every time I hear it! \\"Pea\\" is Flea's solo song that I think is quite underrated! Okay, this song is pretty bad, but the message is great. I love the way Flea takes down a big, tough, macho homophobe in just a few lines! \\"One Big Mob\\" is a song that I'm only rather partial to. It's not great, but then it's not that bad either. It begins very heavily with lots of manly chanting! I think this sounds great, then for the song to slow down and become really peaceful, only to fire up again towards the end makes for a wonderfully arranged piece, quite different to the other songs on the album. \\"Walkabout\\" begins with some great guitar work, before slowing down and transforming into a really nice ballad. The guitars and drums are still present in the background, but Kiedis' vocals make for a very cool chillout track. \\"Tearjerker\\" is one of the best songs on the album. It's quite a nice ballad with some great guitar work that creates a relaxing atmosphere. The lyrics in this song make love seem so simple and get down to the basics of how Kiedis is feeling. He bares his soul here, and the chorus is a revelation.<br /><br />The album title track, \\"One Hot Minute,\\" is a bit overblown in my opinion. It starts off quite well, but I think the guitars and vocals don't quite work well together in this song. Still not a bad effort though. \\"Falling Into Grace\\" opens with some weird, guttural noises and is quite funky in its approach. I like the chorus with Kiedis' vocals in an almost falsetto style. He's also backed up beautifully by the female backing vocals of Kristen Vigard, who helps to harmonise the melody of the vocal arrangement. \\"Shallow Be Thy Game\\" begins with drums that get louder and louder as the seconds progress. Suddenly, it's easy to see where the intro to \\"Can't Stop\\" may have come from! \\"Transcending\\" closes the album out after 13 songs, and is a tribute from the band to the late River Phoenix. The bass and guitar line work in perfect synchronicity in this gorgeous song, before it speeds up and gets louder to play out a great ending to sixty red hot minutes.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />This album isn't perfect, but then not many are. A lot of people who are supposedly long-time Chili Peppers fans don't like their new sound, as expressed on \\"By The Way.\\" This is the album that got me into the band though, so I can hardly say I dislike it. By starting from their more recent material, I've worked back in time with their albums, listening to their older material and ultimately finding it more difficult to get into. This is because of the evolution in their style. Albums like \\"Californication,\\" \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik\\" and \\"Mother's Milk\\" are incredible pieces of rock art. \\"One Hot Minute\\" is a level down from this, but it's still a great rock album and I admire the band's willingness to experiment and evolve over time.The album title track, \\"One Hot Minute,\\" is a bit overblown in my opinion.

B0000057C5|5.0|This was my first Rammstein album I got, and I just couldn't stop listening to it. \\"Du Hast\\" is worth buying the whole album alone. That song is so cathchy, sometimes whenever I listen to this album in my cd player I like to put it on repeat and listen to it over and over again. This album also has some catchy as hell guitar riffs, cool drumming, and oh those mesmerizing German vocals. Yeah I know the vocals are sung in German, but that's what makes this kick ass industrial metal machine known as Rammstein. Buy this album now.

B000002B2X|5.0|But get it for cheap, due to its length.<br /><br />All of the songs are wonderful AIC mellow material like the more acoustic songs on Dirt or all the tracks of Jar of Flies.  These songs aren't as experimental as Jar of Flies, but they are all extremely solid and are classic AIC songs.<br /><br />This EP has the unique feel of being the eye of the storm, the moment at the end of a hard day when you realize it's over and you can just sleep.  It's interesting to see AIC trying to be optimistic when they were obviously going through bad times (leading to the total hopelessness of Dirt and onward).  \\"Something's gotta turn out right\\" says Layne in \\"Got Me Wrong\\".  The whole album sounds painfully honest.<br /><br />\\"Brother\\" is primarily sung by Cantrell, and is one of 2 songs to feature Ann Wilson.  Simply an awesome song.  Good intro to the CD.  \\"Got Me Wrong\\" most will have heard due to the fact that it was on the radio quite a bit.  Good guitar solos.  \\"Right Turn\\" and \\"Am I Inside\\" are more simplistic than the first 2 songs (probably why some people don't like them) using no drums or bass from what I can tell.  \\"Right Turn\\" has Mark Arm and Chris Cornell on lead vocals, and with Layne they make this a very interesting song.  With a lone guitar, each singer has a verse until the end where they all finally sing at once.  Fantastic but short.  \\"Am I Inside\\" has clever lyrics and a wonderful chorus, again with Ann Wilson.  Very mysterious and strange.  They never did anything like it again.  The hidden song \\"Love Song (Take 1)\\" isn't really even worth mentioning.  If it was actually considered part of the album, it would totally ruin the mood.  I didn't find it particularly funny, either, but I'm not going to criticize the band for putting it there.<br /><br />The production is worse than Jar of Flies by a long shot, you can still hear everything but it's harder.  The acoustic guitars have a more percussive and less melodic sound so you have to listen close to tell exactly what is being played during lower notes.  This doesn't really bother me though.<br /><br />Highly recommended along with all their other albums.tell exactly what is being played during lower notes.

B0006L16N8|5.0|Look, this is a GREAT album. It's better than AROBTTH. The problem with reading Amazon.com reviews is that half of them are written by intelligent people and the other half are written by complete idiots. Anyone giving this album 1, 2, or 3 stars is just a moron. \\"X&Y\\" is a masterpiece. People who can't recognize good music should just cut their ears off. And those tempted to write lame 1-star reviews should stay away from meaningful instruments like computers. They were not meant to be abused by fools and hacks. Any review with less than 4 stars just skip it, because there's a good chance that the person who wrote is has an IQ less than their rating. With this album, Coldplay has put themselves on a path to greatness. But I guess it takes a great mind to recognize another. This is an excellent album. You're really missing out is you don't have it.
6301973410|4.0|\\"Mildred Pierce\\" a 109 minute black and white film was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture and Best Actress, Michael Curtiz's 1945 noir classic.  This film features a great, Oscar-winning come back by its star, Joan Crawford, who was fired by MGM and voted box-office poison before filming began. <br /> <br />The film begins with the murder of Monte Beragon (Zachary Scott) in the beach house he lives in with his wife, Mildred Pierce Beragon (Joan Crawford). Four bullets are fired into him at close range and he dies while calling out Mildred's name. Mildred walks in the rain on a pier and appears to be the one who killed him. She certainly had a reason to kill her good-for-nothing husband.  <br /> <br />The film is told in flashback from the murder scene, as the suspects are brought into the police station to be interrogated.  The suspects include former husband Bert (Bennett), whom Mildred married at 17; business associate and close friend, Ida (Eve Arden); a former real estate partner of her husband's, Wally Fay (Jack Carson); and, the torn downed Mildred.  <br /> <br />As Mildred's interrogation starts the film starts its flashback to her first marriage to Bert and how he loses his real-estate partnership with Wally and starts seeing a mistress.  Mildred leaves Bert saying that she can make it on her own and becomes a waitress to support herself and her gentle daughter Kay and her money hungry 16 year old daughter, Veda (Ann Blyth).  With the help of Wally's keen business skills she secures an ideal place to open a restaurant. She purchases the land from wealthy society loafer Monte Beragon. The place is an overnight success and Mildred is now living in a mansion, and providing Veda with all the love that money could buy. But this kid is so rotten that it's impossible to believe that her mother could still love her so much.  <br /> <br />Monte turns out to be a snaky guy, playing off both mother and daughter for his love. When he has cash problems Mildred helps him out despite how he looks down upon her as a working women, just like her daughter does as someone with greasy hands from working in the kitchen.  After Mildred divorces Bert, she is lured in by the handsome Monte's charms. She marries him, despite not loving him, because she wants Veda to return home. <br /> <br />All these melodramatics were heavy-handed and Mildred's possessive desires were hard to explain, except she's someone who encouraged others to take advantage of her because she never found satisfaction in either marriage or with herself. It was hard to feel sorry for her, since she brought this tragedy onto herself. The film is very reflective of 1940s attitudes about independent women who desert the idea of a nuclear family, and how dangerous it could be for them to do that.  <br />
B0000CDLA7|5.0|I see that there are a lot of people that don't like this CD. I've been listening to DT for about 6 months now and I think they're one of the best bands to ever come togeather. I've listened to their old stuff, and I've listened to there new stuff. I think this CD is just as good as any of there other CD's. Then again I love just about any rock or metal CD you can throw at me. I think DT had something to get out of there systems, and they did it on this CD. There is a ton of very cathy heavy riffs, especially in \\"Honor Thy Father\\" its a pretty nice song but gets a little reapeatative. But it's not like the whole cd is heavy. \\"Vacant\\" is a pretty slow song, and \\"In the Name of God\\" is slow mostly twards the end.<br /><br />So the bottom line is - If you like old DT, and like heavy stuff as well, then you'll probly enjoy this. otherwise, you might just want to stick with the old stuff.
B000035P5E|2.0|I think Eye of the Needle, at least as the film tells the story, suffers from a common problem I have seen in a lot of \\"action thrillers\\":  poor character development.  Why should we care about these characters one way or the other?  Instead we have a modicum of action and violence, a dose of beautiful ocean scenery, and lovemaking.  There was not much complexity or discernment in any of the characters. Donald Sutherland simply looks depressed, as a serious actor might be if he found himself wasting his time making a bad film. <br /> <br />Alfred Hitchcock did a much better film along the same lines with \\"The 39 Steps\\".
B0002IVN9W|5.0|First of all, I'd like to comment on the fellow who said that &quot;gone are the days of Our Lady Peace and Default&quot;.  Ok, look, Our Lady peace has put out some of the most moving, inspirational music I have ever listened to. They could easily take down any band with that respect, including The Arcade Fire. Unfortunately their new music is not quite the same, however this is not an OLP review, this is an Arcade Fire review.<br />That being said, this album is incredible. It's wonderful to listen to indie music where the band's dreams of music havent been washed away by a producer's concerns with marketing and sounding radio-friendly. Every song on this album is listenable, many are quite inspirational. My personal favourites are Neighbourhood #1 (Tunnels), and Rebellion (Lies). Definitely recommend it if you're into alternative rock, or into bands like Our lady peace, stars, the stills, coldplay, etc etc.
1573223026|5.0|I enjoyed Hornby's inventive approach to this seemingly dark topic, suicide.  I expected a somber read, but found myself laughing out loud several times.  He doesn't take the questions of Life and Death too lightly, nor does he take them too seriously.  He finds the perfect mix of melancholia, humor, depression, and excitement.<br /><br />Hornby writes the book in first person, but the point of view is passed around between the four main characters.  My main concern when I discovered this format was that I was going to be re-living events through the four characters eyes, constantly back-tracking in time to get all points of view.  Fortunately, Hornby avoids this pitfall by never having the story fold back on itself.  This preserves the forward motion of the story.  The reader is left with the impression that four very different people have written their personal memoirs and an editor deftly pieced them together to create a moving story.  We've all read books where a young girl is speaking and you just can't get it out of your head that a middle-aged man is writing how he imagines a young girl would speak.  Hornby doesn't have that problem. He writes from the point of view of different ages, sexes, and nationalities.  You don't feel the heavy hand of the author weighing down their words.  So in the end, Hornby's fiction feels like non-fiction.<br /><br />While Hornby creates and develops his convincing characters, he includes insightful commentary on current London (and global) culture, such as the \\"Starbuck-ing\\" of the world, tabloid culture, and our obsession with celebrity.  He doesn't necessarily condemn these things, he just starts conversations about them, or rather his characters do.  Hornby takes some highly unlikeable people and fleshes them out so the reader cares what they think, and most importantly cares if they live or die.<br /><br />I didn't really enjoy Hornby's last book, \\"How to be Good.\\"  I agree with several Amazon reviewers of HTBG who wrote something like, \\"That was an interesting premise and a fun ride, but what was the point?\\"  I felt like I had wasted a few days of reading.  \\"A Long Way Down\\" begins in a manner similar to \\"How to be Good,\\"  an intriguing but highly implausible exposition that shows great promise.  While reading I was saying to myself, \\"Don't burn me again Hornby!  Don't take me on this wild journey for no apparent reason!\\"  Fortunately, \\"A Long Way Down\\" has a point.  Not one I can sum up in a few sentences, but a point nonetheless.<br /><br />There's no way to discuss the plot without ruining the book for you.  Just order the book and enjoy a brilliant summer read.an interesting premise and a fun ride, but what was the point?\\"  I felt like I had wasted a few days of reading.  \\"A Long Way Down\\" begins in a manner similar to \\"How to be Good,\\"  an intriguing but highly implausible exposition that shows great promise.

The grooves these guys get into are gut wrenching! Steve Gadd is one of my favorite drummers ever! This guy has SO much technique and yet when the music dictates 'groove' he is the best there is! Never overstated. <br />Billy Preston is a joy to watch and hear. <br />Eric himself is a master! <br /> <br />SIMPLY FANTASTIC! DON'T MISS IT!
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Avenged Sevenfold have totally changed their sound and it is for the better. Any dumb Sh*t can just stand up there and scream out a song. Yeah the lyrics are a bit weak but damn does the music make up for it. Tracks 4 and 5 are amazing, this cd should get more credit than it is getting and it will grow on you if you give it a couple of listens. Well done A7X! \m/\m/ <br />
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|I love to buy Greatest Hits albums, because they are ussually filled with the best songs from an artist, and i end up liking most of them, Shania Twain's Greatest Hits is so far the BEST CD I have ever heard in my life, it has soo many #1 songs on it, and 4 brand new ones, that will soon be big hits too. whether you are a rock, pop, or country fan, this album is the one that mixes it all together.
B00005JMJ4|5.0|This movie was one of the best that I hae seen for a while.  It is a little slow, but it keeps your attention because you begin to love the characters.  There is great acting, and the storyline is excellent. <br /> <br />I would not recommend this movie to people that enjoy the boring and usual movie.  This one is actually original...I loved it.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|There is very little you can say about a group like The Mars Volta, they are very young, energetic, and above all they are willing o take risks, that's what this album its all about, its like they simply forget about any kind of rules about how you're suposed to make music, they take experimentaion to another level.<br /><br />Musical guest stars make excellent collaborations, for example for people that doesn't know about salsa music Larry Harlow its a true legend that can only be compared to celia cruz or tito puente, he's one of the greatest piano players in the world, and he just fits into this musical journey, if you dont consider that as an experiment in a rock album, i dont know what can be.<br /><br />If you are really into sound textures, this album is just for you, if you are really into complex melodies, this album is just for you, if you are really into psycodelia, this album is just for you, if you are really into exploration, this album is just for you....and yeah if you are really really into music (any kind) this album is just what you are waiting for!!!
0440178002|5.0|I had this book in the car, and latter work locker.  I picked it up and read it for 20 minutes every day on my lunch break.  Over a year after starting it, I finished it.  I had watched the Tv show, and liked it, and the book was even better.  It'll likely be a bit before I think about picking up the book again, simply because even reading an hour a night it'll take me a bit to wade thru it.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|I've always loved DT for there diverse musical skills from Images and Words(which was actually the first CD i ever bought)in 92, then Awake seeing a more aggressive approach (which i loved). Since then they have went from soft to hard to heavy to midtempo with each passing album, with Oactavarium it seems they have hit a brick wall. How in the world can you expect to put out an album like Train Of Thought, one of the Heaviest DT albums to date and then put out something as slow and tiresome as this disc?? I myself love metal, hard rock and basically anything else with the word ROCK-METAL in it, but DT have now abandoned this because of what critics and fans alike have said about the bands last few albums. SO what!!! I firmly believe that with all the covering of Master Of Puppet, and Iron Maiden's Number Of The Beast that DT should have put out something ten times better and more complex than this. Petrucci's signature speed picking and overlays are no where to be found here, and portnoys hand and foot combo's along with his creative polyrythmic touch have broken down to straight forward bora bora drumming and James Labrie who wailed on his new solo album sounds like he's asleep at the wheel here. Not sure what the problem is if they have writers block or just wanted to given Jordan a chance to show off his skills(not that he needs to) i'm not sure, but all i know is this is the worst DT album to date, Panic Attack is ok but far from anything grand. See ya next album, hopefully its an improvement.
0670033693|5.0|It is always a joy to find a new writer. One with the ability to set the hook and reel you into his world. Montana and Wyoming have provided a home for writers and settings for their stories, but recently their numbers seem to have exploded. A well done story, good characters, a literate mind and a good time. I'll be back for more.
B00011F5DK|5.0|My 21 year old college student (math major) brought this home with a couple of friends and we enjoyd it so much we had to buy one.  The only warning is to watch when playing with math and physic's majors (they think in shapes anyhow). <br /> <br />One of his friend's added fun to his play by seeking to accomplish certain goals each game, claim the exact center, go from corner to corner etc.  And in our competative household, trying to gang up and block another player from being able to move was fair game too.
B00003CXCT|4.0|QUICK REVIEW OF THE SET:  These versions aren't quite the movies I saw as a kid or have on VHS but they are pretty darn close to the same.  Lucas decided to make changes, for better or for worse and for whatever reason.  I'm glad the movies are on DVD despite these changes because I want them to last longer than the tapes that will wear out. <br /> <br />It is good to see the included extras but I wanted more and that is the main reason I lowered the rating.  Don't expect anything on the level of the Lord of the Rings platinum sets.  I do appreciate the commentary on all three films, though. <br /> <br />Watching them again, with the recent context of episodes I-III, I realize how much more I will enjoy IV-VI as I grow older and my kids start to watch (and they won't care or notice the changes unless someone points them out).  The reason that we have the new movies is because of the originals.  Maybe a newer, better set will come out in the future but for now, I think this set is worth owning.
B000001DU5|4.0|Tears For Fears is my favorite group, so it is very hard for me to be critical of any effort that they release.  As someone who is a deep Tears For Fears fans, the greatest hits compilation \\"Tears Roll Down\\" might be overkill for me.   With the exception of a new track, this compilation provides a sampling of what are widely considered the \\"hits\\" for the band over the first three albums.   If you look at this collection as a primer for a new fan of Tears For Fears, this collection is going to do the job.   If you are a deeper fan like myself, you may be disappointed.  However, I'm going to write this review from the perspective of a new Tears For Fears fan. <br /> <br />Tears For Fears was a band formed by Bath England's Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal.  Curt and Roland would leave Graduate in 1981.  Much of the reason why they left Graduate was that they didn't want to be confined to a band.    When they would form Tears For Fears - they would operate in a \\"project\\" mode.  This would mean that Curt and Roland would form the nucleus and bring in surrounding musicians to help them complete the picture.  Tears For Fears would release three albums with Curt and Roland as the core nucleus:  \\"The Hurting\\" (1982); \\"Songs From the Big Chair\\" (1985), and \\"The Seeds of Love\\" (1989).   The collection \\"Tears Roll Down\\" consists of 11 songs from these three albums, plus one new song.   For the first two albums, the lineup would also consist of Keyboardist Ian Stanley and Drummer Manny Elias.   On the third album, R&B/Gospel singer Oleta Adams would also be a part of the project.  There are also many other various and talented musicians that would work with Tears For Fears - including Nicky Holland, who emerge as a key songwriter on \\"The Seeds of Love\\".  Unfortunately, after \\"The Seeds of Love\\", Curt and Roland would go separate ways.  Roland would continue to record and perform under the Tears For Fears name.   It wasn't until 2004's \\"Everybody Loves a Happy Ending\\", where Curt and Roland would reunite as Tears For Fears once again. <br /> <br />Many people associate Tears For Fears as a 1980s \\"Pop\\" band.   This is partially true.  In a lot of ways, their music reflects the 1980s Pop music scene.  As many are aware, the early 1980s sound started out as a Synth-Pop song, but by the late 1980s transformed to a more \\"natural\\" guitar-laden sound. When Tears For Fears would release \\"The Hurting\\", you could generalize it as Synth-Pop, but it really was an album that put a dark and haunting spin on New Wave.  As the title indicated, many of the songs dealt with hurt and pain.    By the time \\"Songs From the Big Chair\\" was released, it could be argued that the band moved more toward a Pop sound.   But the sound would incorporate elements of jazz, and even harder-rock.   By the time \\"The Seeds of Love\\" was released, they would have completely transformed themselves to a natural, guitar-laden sound - some would even term this this sound as \\"Beatlesque\\". Overall - innovation is not a problem with Tears For Fears. <br /> <br />As mentioned, this album focuses on the \\"hits\\".   The distribution of \\"hits\\" is as follows:  \\"The Hurting\\" (\\"Mad World\\", Pale Shelter\\", \\"Change\\"); \\"Songs From the Big Chair\\" (\\"Everybody Wants to Rule the World\\", \\"Shout\\", \\"Head Over Heels\\", \\"I Believe\\", \\"Mothers Talk\\"); \\"The Seeds of Love\\" (\\"Sowing the Seeds of Love\\", \\"Woman in Chains\\", \\"Advice for the Young at Heart\\").  This also contains the new song \\"Laid So Low (Tears Roll Down\\").  It is worth noting that this song would be later released on the \\"Saturnine, Martial and Lunatic\\"  CD- a CD devoted to rare and B side songs by Tears For Fears.    <br /> <br />Unfortunately \\"Tears Roll Down\\" doesn't have its tracks in chronological order.  I usually prefer my greatest hits compilations to be in chronological order.  This allows me to see how the band has evolved over time.   With the case of Tears For Fears, this would have been a most positive thing - because this band not only evolved - but they underwent a transformation during the 1980s. <br /> <br />\\"Tears Roll Down\\" was the first of several greatest hits compilations by the band.   Here are some of the others: <br /> <br />\\"Shout: The Very Best of Tears For Fears\\": This is a more comprehensive collection than \\"Tears Roll Down\\".  All of the original songs on \\"Tears Roll Down\\" are on \\"Shout\\".  This collection also contains some \\"B\\" side songs as well as two songs from \\"Elemental\\" (the first post Curt Smith Tears For Fears collection).  For the most part, this collection also goes in a chronological order. <br /> <br />\\"20th Century Masters - The Millennium Collection: The Best of Tears for Fears\\":  This is a less comprehensive collection than \\"Tears Roll Down\\".  Only one song from \\"Shout\\" is included\\" (\\"Change\\").  It also includes one song from \\"Elemental\\" and one B-side song.  This collection is not in chronological order. <br /> <br />\\"Ultimate Collection\\": This is a three CD import set - and is the most comprehensive set.  It includes 37 songs in chronological order.  It includes songs through 1995's \\"Raoul and the Kings of Spain\\" (the second post Curt Smith album).  One of the CDs is devoted to remixes and also contains a rare Curt Smith solo track.   If you are looking to go deep, this would be the collection to get. <br /> <br />Overall, I wouldn't put \\"Tears Roll Down\\" as the strongest compilation out there.   It still is a terrific way for the new fan to get on-board with Tears For Fears.  While I would give \\"Shout\\" and \\"Ultimate Collection\\" 5 stars, this one falls a notch below because it is less complete.  But the quality of what is contained on this collection is top-notch.  There isn't a bad song on this collection - and that's ultimately what matters.   This is still recommended, but mostly for the newbie fan.
B000002L3P|4.0|Okay everyone before you go slamming someone for making changes in their style and sound I suggest that you strap on a guitar yourself and try playing the same thing over and over and over again and try to remain enthusiastic about it.. <br />I'll admit that this recording is quite a departure from Kens previous stylings.. Some songs sound to me a bit like Lenny Kravitz, some almost sound to me a bit like Cry of Love meets Brother Cane ... But they're only comparisons.. These songs are still Kenny Wayne and I am humbled by his ability and facility with his instrument.(Makes me almost want to put mine down and not pick it up again...) <br />                         Jimi Hendrix lamented the same feelings back in the 60's when he wanted to move on stylistically but everyone was still screaming for him to play Hey Joe or whatever.  <br />                   Just like eating waffles everyday for breakfast....It can get old.. We ALL need change once in a while.Why should our modern day minstrels be any different.. I'd say don't give up on Ken just yet.. <br />                                       I remember giving Living Colour (remember them?) two second chances because I dug their first disc so much. But Vernon Reid's stylistic change just lost me..Too avant garde I guess.. <br />                             Ken I give you credit for singing on your own songs. You can pull it off.. There are others who,in my opinion,absolutely should NOT be singing on their songs but shall remain nameless because this is just my opinion..  <br />          I suppose this isn't so much a review of Kens music as it is me going to bat for him ( not that he needs me to or would even want me to)and anyone else that has the courage to try change...Just wanted to throw in my $.02 worth I guess. I see WAY too many reviews on this site that spew forth nothing but shallow narrow minded negativity...  <br />                                       I doubt that this review will be very helpful to toomany people in influencing them whether or not to buy this cd.But if it helps maybe to change someones thought process regarding unneccesary negative ranting then my mission has been accomplished... <br />                                        Thanks for reading......
B0006L16N8|2.0|so who's ready for an omelette. This just doesn't even come close to the previous albums. The whole album is about Chris Martin's voice, much like every new U2 album is about Bono's voice. I got the sense from the X tracks that they're trying to take their music in a slightly different direction, while most of the Y tracks resonated more strongly with the previous albums. I'm all for bands going in new directions; I'm just not sure this one is headed in the right direction, musically. Puts me a bit in mind of Pink Floyd, actually. When the albums just became about Roger Waters (e.g. The Final Cut), that was the end.
B00008J2DQ|5.0|First of all, this album is amazing. People keep complaining about the albums having the same sound. Theirs ways this can be bad and ways this can be good. One bad thing about sounding the same is that their is a chance that you can get bored with the sound, which is not the case with me, and another thing is that it's a little safe, not taking risks. The good thing about keeping the same kind of sound is that you will insure that you keep your dieheart fans and not taking the risk of losing them. You know, the people who loved the sound the way the early albums did. I have experenced this before and droped a band for doing a different sound and didn't sound like the old group in the beginning.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Three calendar years is a long time to wait for a studio album. I'm sure it feels even longer when you end up re-recording the album three times over. And with all of the systematic ways in which world-wide touring and promotion and the release of singles to radio and the production of music videos is done, it's no wonder it now takes upwards of several years in-between major releases by big name bands. It all makes the workload that a band like The Beatles was able to achieve in a single year look downright impossible in this day and age. <br /> <br />As I'm sure most of us already know, the copy of \\"X&Y\\" which we have now in our possession is the third version of the album, recorded earlier this year after the band's spur of newfound enthusiasm and creativity. But as many of you know, this isn't the first time that the band scraped entire albums of material. The final version of \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" was, if I recall correctly, the second recording session after the initial sessions were completely shelved. Funny enough, most of those shelved songs, which then became b-sides to \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" singles, ended up becoming some of my favorites: \\"One I Love,\\" \\"Crests Of Waves,\\" \\"1.36,\\" \\"I Ran Away,\\" and \\"Murder.\\" Just an example in variation of taste between fan and band, I suppose. But, after all, a good call on the band's behalf, because \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" ended up being their commercial break-through, reaching the same masses that swarmed music stores on June 7 to pick up \\"X&Y.\\" <br /> <br />Putting all of Coldplay's music side-by-side and judging it on completeness, \\"Parachutes\\" is still my hands-down favorite. In my opinion, that album truly takes the name \\"masterpiece\\" and does it justice. Not to discredit \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head;\\" it is full of terrific songs, featuring one of the all-time best front-ends of a CD with \\"Politik,\\" \\"In My Place,\\" \\"God Put A Smile Upon Your Face,\\" and \\"The Scientist,\\" but as a whole, as an album experience, that's where it falls short. However, that's where \\"X&Y\\" excels, is in Coldplay's return to a more complete listening from start to finish. \\"X&Y\\" reflects the Coldplay of \\"Parachutes\\" in the way in which you can put this latest release on at the start and listen through to the end, no skipping around track-to-track necessary. <br /> <br />I really despise track-by-track breakdowns, so I'll spare you the same suffering. What I will say about the music is that it is distinctly Coldplay: it's probably clich as hell to say, but they've managed to keep their style, but not sound the same. After all, it's hard to be one of the biggest bands in the world and now have a burden on your shoulders that keeps whispering in your ear, \\"It's gotta be big...bigger than the last.\\" Instead of just being able to make music, the band is now worried about living up to expectations and record sales. It's the danger that comes from living up to hype rather than living up to ability. Whether it's in the world of film and it's \\"Star Wars: Episode I\\" or in the world of music and it's the follow-up to \\"Jagged Little Pill\\" or \\"Yourself Or Someone Like You,\\" there's a real expectation by the masses, and it can cause an artist to either flourish or flounder. <br /> <br />Thankfully, from what I've seen in interviews with the guys of Coldplay, they have a strong bond, which makes them a much better band. Things they've said and done have really impressed me. It was on their \\"Live 2003\\" DVD in the documentary that showed how grateful they were to be playing music for a living. Whereas most show-boat musicians would gawk at a morning radio show performance after a late show the previous night, Coldplay did it, and they even commented on how it would have been all-too-easy to complain and not do it. They went through with it, the show went on. And in a recent interview, the guys said they took 18 months to record \\"X&Y\\" because they needed some time to get away from the fictitious world of touring and promotion and the life of rock stars. They said they had to so that they didn't end up writing an album full of songs about touring and the ever-so-hard life of a musician. That made me so happy to hear that. How many bad albums have you bought that wind up that way, full of complaints about groupies and no green M&Ms? I know I've heard my share. <br /> <br />Honestly, there was a point in 2003 when I worried that Coldplay's next album would end up being nothing but ballads to Gwyneth and baby Apple. That isn't the case come 2005. Fortunately, we've ended up with a high quality assortment of tunes, which are well crafted and will be killer to hear live. What impresses me most is the maturity of their sound, which stems from the evolution of their songs. Take \\"Talk,\\" for example: comparing the \\"X&Y\\" version to the demo version, in addition to including Kraftwerk, now includes portions of the 2003 road-tested track \\"Ladder To The Sun,\\" ends up being one of the strongest songs, if not the best, on the album. <br /> <br />With \\"X&Y,\\" I truly believe that there is something for everyone. Whether you're into the album experience or just like standout tracks. Whether you loved their uber-hit \\"Clocks\\" or you're like me and prefer their deeper cuts, \\"X&Y\\" does not disappoint.
B0006L16N8|3.0|While I wouldn't call them the next Radiohead, there is something about Coldplay and their ability to write songs. And also like Radiohead, their main frontman usually gets top billing over the other members. We may love Johnny Greenwood's riffs or Ed O Brien's playing yet we can't seem to name them for some reason. Same with these guys too. Whereas Radiohead gave us a surprise double hook with Kid A and Amnesiac, Coldplay just keeps giving the same punch, hoping after awhile they'll make a dent, instead we get used to it easily. <br /> <br />Square One: Don't Panic had a likability despite its short length while Politik had all the bombast a opener can have. This is more subdued. Opens with ambience that could easily fit on a Pink Floyd or Mogwai record before Chris starts singing, and the rest come in. It's a good opener but I find Politik better. 8/10 <br /> <br />What If: Starts with Chris and the piano singing about the possible upsets in life with strings added to give it more atmosphere. Then song then gets better as the rest of the band joins in and Chris does nice falsettos in the chorus. After several listens, it's likable. 8/10 <br /> <br />White Shadows: It reminds me U2 back in their War/Unforgettable Fire days which is no surprise since it has Edge-like guitar lines. It's a good track and a good song overall. Chorus bugs me slightly. Also it's a bit long. 8/10 <br /> <br />Fix You: Part of me wants to hate this song. It's literally the Scientist Part II with piano/keyboards starting the verses, then guitar being added after the first chorus, Chris's great falsetto singing and the big emotional climax. But it's such a damn good song that you just give up and like the thing. Those magnificent bast*rds. 9/10 <br /> <br />Talk: Lifting, sorry, \\"borrowing\\" the melody line from Computer Love by Kraftwerk, it's another song that could be a good single. Nice and upbeat, even though it has a Edge-like guitar line taken from a Kraftwerk song. Odd. 8/10 <br /> <br />X&Y: Here's where I feel the album hits a snag.  Good use of the slide guitar the chorus is kind of uninteresting. I don't know if it's just me but it doesn't really sound clean in terms of production, almost sounds \\"too much\\" during the chorus. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Speed of Sound: Since we had the Scientist Part II why not have the Clocks sequel too? The main riff is piano, and even the guitar during the pre-chorus sounds like the Clocks piano line. But it's a likable song but not a modern classic. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />A Message: Kind of reminds me of something off Parachutes until it begins with the drums and the strings and keyboards. Could've been sung without more mmph! to me. I like the guitar changing which ear it goes to(on headphones). 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Low: Big and upbeat only it's not catchy. Odd. Bass-driven and the guitars add some odd flavoring. It's just to me a not very interesting track. Should've been left off. Good use of falsetto and ska guitar chords. And it's over 5 minutes, oy! 6/10 <br /> <br />The Hardest Part: Beautiful guitar arpeggios and piano chords caught my ear but the rest didn't. Like many songs on the last half, it could've been put in the oven and worked on more. 7/10 <br /> <br />Swallowed in the Sea: Not the greatest lyrics and a bit convincing vocal delivery. The chorus catches me somewhat, maybe after repeated listens I'll like it more. Nice and short ditty that you'll probably like if you give it time. 8/10 <br /> <br />Twisted Logic: Weird organ and Chris's singing start it off before the guitar comes in(which sounds like a slower Everybody Hurts). One complaint: remember that Radiohead intro I said? Well the lyrics to the chorus here: you'll go backwards again, you'll go forwards again..., kinda similar to Radiohead's \\"I'll go forwards, you'll go backwards\\" chorus from Electioneering no? 8/10 <br /> <br />Til Kingdom Come: Originally written for Johnny Cash but the Man in Black passed before he could record it. Chris has a nice lower voice in a largely acoustic song strummed in a kind-of folkish 1970's way. Why this was a secret song I have no idea. Probably didn't fit with the big production stuff of the album. My favorite song after Fix You. 9/10 <br /> <br />The songs run together a bit too easily, some rather bad lyrics(\\"my song is love\\", \\"puzzles keep puzzling me?\\"), U2-inspired guitar. For some reason we tolerate Iron Maiden, Slayer and AC/DC writing the same record 10 times over yet we hate when Coldplay, Radiohead, REM, U2 and Smashing Pumpkins repeat themselves. While this isn't a bad record, the long incubation time on this record should suggest a really super punch in the face record, only it's more like a punch in the arm.
B000001EAQ|5.0|This is the most exciting U2 album ever: The album takes countless schizophrenic twists. This complex, intense swarm of guitars is held aloft by a solid, inventive rhythm section and an impressive array of electronica and keyboard textures. <br /> <br />Listening to the record, you wouldn't initially realize that there are so many computerized noises weaving through the songs, but a closer listen reveals a dense, texturally-rich presentation that relies equally on both musical approaches. The disorienting delights of the music and the intense messages presented on the lyrics make you feel an unique experience. <br /> <br />The sense of alienation is palpable. If the unstable, quick-slow existence of pop stardom offers Bono both the free time and the necessary stress and disorientation to think in terms as Mofo, maybe half of us though our sense of inertia and unspecified angst have an idea of what he's talking about.  <br /> <br />When the vocals dissolve into a distant storm of rabid, distorted screams, it's not the snortings and foot-stampings of a petulant ingrate, rather a snippet of that same rage that drives us into lousy self-mollification or else off the hinge. A very modern terror, an unreachable itch. <br /> <br />You've got one of the few rock masterpieces of the '90s. This masterpiece won't be surpassed...and you can forget about \\"easy listening\\" right now.
B0000UJDLM|5.0|great family movie will make you laugh and sad and laugh again with jonnhy 5 alive in his amazing story wish they made more than 2 movies
B000929AJQ|1.0|My Friend got \\"with teeth\\", and i burned it just to listen to it for a couple of weeks to see if i wanted to buy it. What a mistake. This whole album is crap, and i can't believe i wasted a dollar on a cd to burn this piece of garbage. If i could, i would give this album a 0 star. Never buy this album
B0009I7NNA|2.0|First off, Waking The Fallen was an excellent CD and Avenged puts on a sick live show.  That said, this album is a disappointment.  For those who believe that M. Shadows doesnt scream because of throat surgery, watch this band on the Warped Tour this summer.  Unless they play ALL new material, anything off of Waking The Fallen will require screaming.  If he screams for that, than he has the ability to scream but is choosing not to use it on this CD.   <br /> <br />The real problem here is the song writing.  This band has fallen into such a formula.  Waking The Fallen's 6-7 minute songs featuring solos and a blend of screaming and singing worked great.  The beauty of that album was the balance between the heavy and the melodic, both musically and vocally.  However, an entire album of singing (especially Shadows' new style of whiny singing) over this band's type of music doesnt quite fit.  Now the songs seem boring and dragged out, sometimes it feels like the band is adding in guitar parts just to compensate for the lack of vocal punch.  Why not take a chance and write a two minute blast of power? No, they choose to add 45 extra seconds of extra guitar riffing just because thats what already worked for them once.  Theyre getting rid of screaming to go in a new direction? How about trying something new musically instead?  We all know that the musicians in this band are extremely talented, but why not try something new instead of trying to impress us with what we have already heard that you can do?
B0002858YS|4.0|Back in an old review, I lamented that a lot of the new big releases I bought were from veterans: bands that have been around for years releasing their 3rd or even their 5th record(like Weezer). I never really cared for Killers first single Somebody Told Me but I decided to give them a chance. Good thing I did. <br /> <br />Jenny Was a Friend of Mine: The lost Cure track? Has the best guitar/bass interplay I've heard recently. Guitar provides the chord changes while bass does the main melody primarily with vocalist Brandon Flowers doing his best Robert Smith voice. Excellent opener. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Mr. Brightside: I avoided the big radio overplay so I'm not sick of it yet. Repeats itself a bit too much but it's one of the great rock songs in recent memory. Very high fretted guitar notes and good use of drones and one incredibly catchy guitar line in the chorus, plus the chorus is a hook on its own. Awesome. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />Smile Like You Mean It: I love the guitar intro and the synth underneath and its odd synth hook during the chorus but the chorus just smacks of laziness(singing the title and that's it, bah). Musically it's good but everything is ok. 8/10 <br /> <br />Somebody Told Me: One of the few rock songs you can probably dance too. The chorus has an odd novelty value about an androgynous boyfriend of a former lover. Good for several listens than that overplayed factor kicks in. 8/10 <br /> <br />All These Things That I've Done: The intro right up until the verse after the band comes in is great, I love the beat and the guitar line. But they sound bored during the chorus and the \\"I've got soul\\" section feels slightly out of place with the gospel choir. Not to mention that line's stupid. 8/10 <br /> <br />Andy, You're a Star: Now we start into some filler territory. I've seen some reviews that love this song but personally I can't stand it. The guitar just sounds too harsh, and the vocals sound like he's not trying until the halfway point. Fuzzy bassdoesn't help either. Bah. 6/10 <br /> <br />On Top: Personally, I love the Megaman like synth. Wow a Weezer solo that sounds right out of Megaman now it's on here. An unexpected comeback for the blue bomber? As a song, it's just mildly interesting. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Change Your Mind: I love the guitar chord riff on this while the synth line sounds cutesy. Great pop ditty that could be a good single, unless they stopped already. But personally go with Jenny first then this. 8.5/10 <br /> <br />Believe Me Natalie: Now this is probably my favorite guitar riff on the entire album even though it's incredibly simple, it just has this kind of ethereal quality to it. Some find it boring, me, I love it. Could've had a minute shaved off though. 9/10 <br /> <br />Midnight Show: Fast-paced verses with ska chords and Unforgettable Fire-like guitar but oh my do I hate that chorus. Like Smile, musically I like it but everything turns me off. 7.5/10 <br /> <br />Everything Will Be Alright: Floating around on the net is a song called Indie Rock and Roll which could've been a good closer. This however sounds like a sonic experiment without the interesting part. Brandon almost sounds like Freddie Mercury at times. Robert Smith, now Freddie Mercury. Huh. 6/10 <br /> <br />Unlike other albums by bands where ideas seem half-baked, here they sound fully cooked but they just not tasty(how's that for an effective analogy?) Still, here's hoping they don't go into sophomore slump land for the next one.
B000002UJQ|5.0|\\"... Oxfordshire 1996, and Radiohead finally begin to record the follow-up to 'The Bends'. Thom Yorke's brain is accelerating. The aforementioned view amplified by the conditions in which he's working. Recording at night, he goes to bed at dawn and wakes at ten to continue the lyrics.  <br /> <br />His state of mind is sleepless and fractured. When 'OK Computer' is finished, Yorke describes the 12 completed songs as \\"Polaroids in my head\\", a succession of snapshots that form a larger whole. Away from distractions and shrouded in secrecy, Radiohead have created an album motivated and unified by one overriding theme: three years away from the millennium, Yorke wants to leave the planet and escape from the routine and clutter of life.  <br />Not that Radiohead have chosen to follow a 1.5 million-selling record with a concept album; at least, not consciously. It's just that virtually every track on 'OK Computer' is driven by a feeling of impotence with the world around it. And it's that realisation which makes 'OK Computer' both age-defining and one of the most startling albums ever made.  <br /> <br />Here are 12 tracks crammed with towering lyrical ambition and musical exploration; that refuse to retread the successful formulas of before and instead opt for innovation and surprise; and that vividly articulate both the dreams and anxieties of one man without ever considering sacrifice or surrender. What makes it so important is its context. After all, 'The Bends' elevated Radiohead into the sphere of stadiums.  <br /> <br />While Thom was dreaming daily of planetary escape, the rest of the group were fashioning alien sounds from earthly instruments. In much the same way as Spiritualized's Jason Pierce became obsessed with new sound when recording 'Ladies And Gentlemen We Are Floating In Space', so it seems did Radiohead. Of course, the first single - 'Paranoid Android' - was designed to prepare you for that: six minutes of disconcerting sound and lyrical distress, halfof which is dominated by freakish guitar spasms and jolting time changes, half by neo-classical choirs and calming acoustics.  <br /> <br />And certainly one of the most bizarre songs ever to find its way into the British Top Five. Still, as far as Radiohead are concerned, that's just the beginning...  <br />The album itself opens with the slashed riffs and sucking electronics of 'Airbag', a song that at once sets the scene for all that's to follow. Yorke's ambivalence towards modern technology (that's also present in the album title) and supernatural insistence that he's \\"back to save the universe\\" are both made immediately apparent. Any hope that such a feat might actually be possible, however, is quickly extinguished by the realities of the rest of side one.  <br /> <br />Not that the album immediately descends into hopelessness and morbid introspection because, while avenues of earthly escape are explored and ultimately rejected, there remains throughout a tangible sense of purpose and uplifting sentiment. Once you've negotiated the real dissatisfaction of 'Paranoid Android' (a possible hymn to the vagaries of music journalism: \\"When I am king you will be first against the wall/With your opinions which are of no consequence at all\\"), what unfolds is a curiously positive experience.  <br /> <br />The lyrics of 'Subterranean Homesick Alien' might crave abduction from this planet and a chance to see the world from outer space (\\"Take me on board.../Show me the world as I'd love to see it\\") and 'Let Down' might recount the feeling of being \\"crushed like a beetle\\" under \\"motorways and tramlines\\", but at no point does this feel dispiriting or self-pitying. As the world speeds by ever faster, Radiohead have attempted to retreat to calmer climes to voice their concern. 'Subterranean Homesick Alien', 'Exit Music' and 'Let Down' are all apparently peaceful: guitars materialise then fade, blissful hidden melodies drift by unnoticed, and previously still songs are suddenlygiven momentum by a change of wind or a movement of the tide.  <br /> <br />Listen closer, however, and you will just about be able to distinguish the sounds of daily existence: of playground babbling and overloaded electrics, of surface noise and indistinguishable drones.  <br />After the fading noise of 'Karma Police', side two opens with a spate of ill-natured cacophony and dehumanised cynicism. 'Fitter Happier' sees Yorke wiring himself up to a synthesized voice machine and delivering a series of increasingly curious lifestyle slogans, while 'Electioneering' buries his rage at the power of multinationals under an avalanche of uncomfortable guitar noise. It's the last (and perhaps only) moment of fight, and it's from here that 'OK Computer' soars towards its climax.  <br /> <br />The claustrophobia of 'Climbing Up The Walls' is rapidly replaced by a trio of songs that equal - if not surpass - 'Street Spirit (Fade Out)''s beatific conclusion to 'The Bends'. Here the band truly dazzle. 'No Surprises' (billed as the band's attempt to rewrite 'What A Wonderful World') marries the resignation of Yorke's lyrics (\\"A job that slowly kills you/Bruises that won't heal... I'll take a quiet life\\") to a spacious wall of melancholy and bright xylophone chimes, while 'Lucky' - previously released on the 'War Child' compilation - brings the conclusion nearer with a continuous surge of Pink Floyd-esque slow-motion guitars.  <br />The album ends with the sound of Thom Yorke's brain decelerating. Buried within 'The Tourist''s monastic chanting and stately guitars, you can just about make out his voice (as grief-ridden and emotive as ever) trying to make sense of what's happening to him: \\"Where the hell am I going?/At 1,000ft per second/Hey man slow down/Idiot slow down\\".  <br /> <br />It's the final, futile attempt to alter the progress of his - or indeed anyone else's - life and it's a perfect finale. Such stoicism renders 'OK Computer' a spectacular success: a true articulation of the anxiety of late-20th century man backed with music not only of extraordinary grace and melody, but also of experimental clarity and vision. Truly, this is one of the greatest albums of living memory - and the one that distances Radiohead from their peers by an interstellar mile.(10/10)\\" <br />

B00006RIO7|4.0|In 2002 I didn't see the reasons for the surrounding hoopla for Miramax's masterpiece Chicago.  I had no desire whatsoever to see it, despite its critical acclaim and --in the end-- numerous Oscars.  Once it hit movie rental stores my parents rented it just because they'd never seen it before, and I happened to sit in and watch it because I had nothing else to do.  I discovered that it was more enjoyable than I'd thought, but it was in its absolutely entertaining musical confections that made it viewable.  Catherine Zeta-Jones delivered and, surprisingly, Renee Zellweger did too; \\"We Both Reached For The Gun\\" was pure magic and \\"I Can't Do It Alone\\" proved just as equal in entertainment and enjoyment.  The soundtrack to Chicago, in my opinion, is much better to purchase than the actual DVD.  Why?  Because though lavish and impressive in scale in production, Chicago's main strong point lies in its music and performance.  Every song, save for a couple drab tracks, prove to be listenable and quite the delectable pieces of candy (\\"Cell Block Tango\\" for example).  Like chocolate, Miramax's Chicago on CD is one record that's just as guilty and just as pleasurable.<br /><br />1. Overture/And All That Jazz ****<br /><br />2. Funny Honey ***1/2<br /><br />3. When You're Good To Mama *****<br /><br />4. Cell Block Tango *****<br /><br />5. All I Care About ***<br /><br />6. We Both Reached For The Gun *****<br /><br />7. Roxie ****<br /><br />8.

If they're not in the film, why put them on its soundtrack?
B00097A5HW|2.0|I don't think this is a very good album. Most of the songs are really bad, I'm so dissapointed. I waited so long for her new music to come out and this is not what I was expecting, if you want to buy some of her best music, buy her first two albums, \\"Pies Descalzos\\" and \\" Donde estan los ladrones?\\". I hope this can be helpful.
B00006LLNU|3.0|When I first listened to the first track, I was literally blown away. I thought, \\"This is what I've been looking for! Finally I've found my album!\\" <br /> <br />Around track two, my hopes were somewhat dulled, but I was willing to continue. <br /> <br />About this time I closed the window that showed the seconds ticking away, and occupied myself with internet games and chatting. <br /> <br />A while later, I figured I must be near the end, it seemed like he'd been going on quite long enough about me \\"sighing on\\". To my dismay, it was only Track 4. Well over half the CD to go. <br /> <br />Fans of Sigur Ros should find something in this album, but nonfans should report directly to Agaetis Byrjun or Kid A, you'll be much happier there.
068987474X|3.0|This book was alright but not something that i would take advice from. Many of the stories i read that other woman/men had submitted, got back what seemed like a absurd response. Sure the phrase \\"Hes just not that into you\\" was great for a while, but he used it on every person in the book. Many times it seemed that the problem wern't something to be reconciled by just dumping your partner.
B00003CXA2|1.0|I was about to begin this review with the statement that I don't understand why this film inspires such intense adulation - but unfortunately, I understand all too well.  Mediocrity and cheap sentimentality has always sold well in America; a \\"feel-good\\" movie wins the audience every time.<br /><br />But what are you \\"feeling good\\" ABOUT...?<br /><br />This movie sells the premise, \\"It's DESIRABLE to be mentally deficient.\\"<br /><br />There is NOTHING desirable about being mentally challenged.<br /><br />I think this film could be called subversive, perhaps even dangerous, in its glorification of simple-minded \\"innocence\\" over rational, thoughtful consideration of what's going on in the society around you.  This film makes light of many serious events in America's history for the sake of some \\"gee-whiz\\" special effects.<br /><br />Come to think of it, it's probably the PERFECT movie for the G. W. Bush era.<br /><br />Definitely NOT entertainment for any thinking, rational person.
B00005JMJ4|1.0|Rarely has such a film been as atuned to its name as this one.  2003's so-called \\"best of\\" film Lost In Translation left me and a majority of its viewers confused and, well, lost.  Not only is there hardly any conversation going on the movie follows two different characters in Japan who basically do nothing.  I tried to give this movie a chance but after about 15 minutes decided I'd leave and do something more productive, like bite my fingernails.  I guess it's true what they say: if critics like a movie then it probably stinks.  Such is Lost In Translation.  Film of the Year?  Shhyeah, riiiiiigggghhhhhttttt.
B00003CXCT|1.0|If the mighty Sith Lord Lucash would openly and honestly state that the DVD box set version is in fact different from both the original (theatrical) and even the special edition (also theatrical) versions then at least he would be spared all the venom and vitriol that has been and is being thrown at him. Indeed, the issue is not whether Darth Lucash may or may not (yet again) make changes to Episodes 4, 5, and 6. Yes, they are his creations and his properties; he may do with them as he wishes. Yet he does have at least an ethical obligation to disclose the fact that they are different from the previously released versions and not pass them off as the same - as shown by the line &quot;Own the Original&quot;. After all, the disclaimer is the standard industry practice adopted by everyone else, including his colleague Steven Spielberg, who clearly states that his &quot;E.T.:Special Edition&quot; is different from the original &quot;E.T.&quot; and unlike Lucash makes both &quot;E.T.&quot; versions available on DVD.

B0006IIKS0|4.0|I find it hard to figure out where all the negative reviews and hatred for Metallica are coming from.  Documentaries are supposed to show the real side of something, which this documentary does very well.  I think a lot oif people are dissapointed to see that Metallica isn't the rebels they were in the eighties, that they are mnillionares who have cushy lives and problems of thier own.  For me, documentaries like these always make me appreciate the music a lot more because when you see how hard it was to make and how many arguments it causes, it makes you appreciate how much work goes into it.  Another documentary that shows a band making an album is I Am Tring to Break Your Heart about the band Wilco (which I think is better than Some Kind of Monster).  If you liked this doc, you'd probably like that one too, even though the music is in no way haevy metal.  <br /> <br />Overall, I though SKoM was a very good watch, and regardless of whether or not you are a Metallica fan, if you like documentaries, you should enjoy this.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I'd like to combine what some the whingers are saying with some praise. Firstly, this album definitely has merit. Only half an hour - but it's cheaper (at least here in Oz) as a result  - and it is what we've come to expect from System - unpredictable. <br /> <br />Some people don't like the pop elements they've used, but they've blended them and are obviously using them as cliches possibly satirizing them at the same time. The album as a whole isn't as heavy as thier others but these new elements add the contrast to replace the \\"heaviness\\" that has been taken away. <br /> <br />Daron Malakian does take up a lot of vocal time on this - a bit too much I think - or rather not enough of Serj - but the harmonies are sensational, even though they do dominate the somgs a bit much. I don't think that Malakian's vocals are bad - it's just Serj has been pushed back too much - and this can also be seen by the poorer quality of lyrics.  <br /> <br />The album is progressive though. It's new - a new sound helped by the new vocals and a more riff-orientated to some of the songs, and while still random and schizoprhonic, seem a bit more conventionally structured. <br /> <br />All in all - I like it and I definitely can't complain - and though it might not be their best album, i've been listening to it continuosly to try and appreciate the somgs enough - it really grows on you.
B00005V0X5|4.0|Subjectively i have found that as my metal taste has matured, i have turned my hand to increasingly older material. KIMB certainly is a poorly mastered album, which further heightens its rawness! The album vividly portrays one pissed off, post-Metallica Mustaine, if you like thrash metal you certainly won't be dissapointed. Stand out tracks include KIMB, These Boots, and Mechanix, which is Metallica's Four Horsemen on speed. Raw, aggressive if a bit two dimensional - the riffs, basslines and drumming are all clinical but, what seems now, a bit text book.
B0007CY2RI|5.0|Leolo is a masterpiece in filmmaking-a dreamlike coming of age story that echoes David Lynch and Federico Felllini, and even predates Jean-Pierre Jeunet. Dark, weird, and, yes, disturbing, Leolo is the story of an imaginative young French-Canadian who believes himself conceived by his mother's clumsy meeting with a tomato.  <br /> <br />I have been waiting for this film on DVD since the format's invention having seen it in an art house in 1992. Also since 1992, I had been waiting expectantly and hopefully for Jean-Claude Lauzon to make another film. Tragically, Lauzon died in a plane crash in 1997 while preparing his third film.
0312323859|5.0|...And if you didn't run out and purchase both of these amazing books!!  I thoroughly enjoyed Emily Giffin's debut novel `SOMEHTING BORROWED' where Rachel, who always played second fiddle to her beautiful, outgoing (self-centered & narcissistic) best friend Darcy Rhone, happened to find the love of her life in Darcy's fianc&eacute;. Giffin took this taboo subject and put a witty and engrossing spin on it without making light of the situation.  However, I only gave that book four stars because of what I felt were loose ends.  I wanted to know what happened to Darcy after she found out about her best-friend and fianc&eacute;s betrayal as well as how the secondary characters reacted to the news.  Well, I had no idea that Giffin intended to do one better than just tying up a few loose ends with an extra chapter or two at the end of `SOMETHING BORROWED'.  Instead she gave fans of the first book this gem of a novel that picked up perfectly where the other left off.<br /><br />`SOMETHING BLUE' begins right after Darcy discovers Rachel and Dex's affair and although she too has had an affair and now finds herself pregnant as a result, she is determined to make the lives of everyone who she feels had wronged her miserable.  As one of the other reviewers stated Giffin does not change the character of Darcy a bit, she is still as self-centered and narcissistic as ever, however, now she has another life to worry about, yet cant seem to quite get that through her head.  But when she decides to move to London with long time friend Ethan she is forced to take a closer look at the person she is and determine what kind of person and mother she wants to become.<br /><br />Giffin really outdid herself with `SOMETHING BLUE', which stands to make `SOMTHIGN BORROWED' even better.  I highly recommend buying both of these wonderful books together and reading them back-to-back, you will not be disappointed!  A great second novel by a very talented and creative new author!!
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Dream Theater is: <br />James LaBrie -- Vocals <br />John Myung -- Bass <br />John Petrucci -- Guitars/Vocals <br />Mike Portnoy -- Drums/Vocals/Percussion <br />Jordan Rudess -- Keyboards/Continuum/Lap Steel Guitar <br /> <br />Dream Theater's new album \\"Octavarium\\" is recently one of my favorites and not only because Dream Theater happens to be my favorite band.  Unlike some of their albums, they have toned down the classic progressive rock keyboarding (although some still remains) and rather impressing us with distorted guitars and a loud bass mixed with a mellow piano backdrop (and obviously the sweet drum stylings of Mike Portnoy).  James LaBrie's singing is better on this one--thanks to notes lower than Fs and some voice distortions in their heavier tracks (ie. \\"The Root of All Evil\\" [track 1] ).  Personally, some of the lyrics are still lame (like \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" lyrics about September 11, 2001) but the music is great.  The only \\"downfall\\" of this album, in my opinion, is track 2 (\\"The Answer Lies Within\\"), which happens to be a laidback piano and light guitar ballad.  Overall, I recommend it to anyone--especially those who may have previously claimed they don't like Dream Theater.  Octavarium might just change your mind. <br /> <br />My Personal Song Ratings (1-5) <br /> <br />Track 1 -- The Root of All Evil -- 5 (nice sounding track--heavier at times and very enjoyable) <br />Track 2 -- The Answer Lies Within -- 2 (like the aforementioned, it's a strange ballad) <br />Track 3 -- These Walls -- 4 (this song could easily get stuck in your head) <br />Track 4 -- I Walk Beside You -- 5 (probably the first single off the album if they release one--nice untraditional DT song) <br />Track 5 -- Panic Attack -- 4 (much like track 1, a very enjoyable song) <br />Track 6 -- Never Enough -- 3 (the music in this song is pretty decent, but the lyrics are almost as bad as track 7) <br />Track 7 -- Sacrificed Sons -- 2 (nice soft song to hear if you ignore the lyrics andthe broadcast news clips in the intro) <br />Track 8 -- Octavarium -- 4 (at first I didn't like this, but it's one of those songs that when you listen to it more and more.. the more enjoyable it becomes) <br />
B00005R2IS|4.0|\\"Mad Max\\" (1979) is a remarkable sci-fi actioner starring Mel Gibson, fresh from Sydney's National Institute of Dramatic Arts, and directed by George Miller, a film buff with film school training. Gibson plays Max Rockatansky, a loner cop patrolling a post-apocalyptic Australia. The highways have become the arena for death games between nomad bikers and cops like Max, along with his partner, Goose (Steve Bisely). Enter the Nightrider (Vince Gil), a vicious biker escaping custody. He has just stolen a car from the Main Force Patrol (MFP) headquarters. A road chase between Max and the Nightrider results in the death of the latter. Unbeknownst to Max, Nightrider's buddys come to town to seek revenge. They are headed by a demented lunatic named Toecutter (Hugh Keays-Byrne). His followers are the mysterious Bubba Zanetti, the drug-addled Johnny the Boy (Nightrider's replacement; not yet a full member), and psychopathic rapists/homosexuals Mudguts, Cundalini, Starbuck, and Diabando. Whilst seeking vengeance upon Max, they wreak much havok along the way. This includes an assault on a young couple, and the slaying of Goose. A horrified Max quits the force, and takes his wife, Jessie (Joanne Samuel), and their baby Sprog, on a much-needed vacation. Unfortunately, Jessie is almost raped by the Toecutter and his gang, but she doesn't tell Max what happened. Rather, the Toecutter gang catches up with them and viciously murders Jessie and Sprog, leaving Max with no choice but to embark on an explosive path of vengeance upon his tormentors. The biker gang is completely without empathy, except for Johnny the Boy, who became a full gang member only after reluctantly setting Goose on fire. The Toecutter is perhaps the creepiest, nastiest villain to ever grace the screen, while Bubba Zanetti epitomizes the ruthless killing-machine whose mission to destroy Max. The other bikers are no less sadistic than the Toecutter. The movie works mostly because of Gibson's performance as the damaged hero, Max. It also features great effects and remarkable stunts, and spawned an even more successful sequel, The Road Warrior (1981). Overall, a very good action film. Only quibble: actors' voices were re-dubbed with American voices, out of fear that audiences wouldn't comprehend the Australians' accent.
B0007TKH66|2.0|especially compared to the fluffy \\"adventure\\" of the reality TV craze that has infected all the networks. I had high hopes for Enterprise; I haven't seen a Star Trek that I really enjoyed since The Next Generation went off the air, and the idea of a lower-tech, and hopefully more gutsy and engaging, Star Trek was appealing.<br /><br />Unfortunately much of Enterprise is the same tired material that has been done and re-done in all the shows that came before it. Like the original, there is a Vulcan Science Officer. Like Voyager, Enterprise insists on having a ridiculously cat-suited female prancing around. This is made more ludicrous by the fact that she is T'Pol, a Vulcan...is it really logical to wear something so skin-tight that mobility is at stake?<br /><br />The crew of this first Enterprise face the same situations that the crews of subsequent ships have faced for hundreds and hundreds of episodes; I'm not saying that these situations aren't sometimes interesting and even creative (an unexpected development with Tripp in \\"Unexpected\\" was delightful) but really, how many times can a captain almost-instantly pacify races who have been archenemies for hundreds of years before it gets tired? How many defiant and/or motivational speeches and words of encouragement can he give before we realize he's some sort of strange hybrid of Captains Picard, Kirk, AND Janeway?<br /><br />Much of the show's watchability comes from what it doesn't have: high technology, people beaming in and out constantly, etc. It's interesting to watch how the crew of this ship make do without what we've come to see as standard Starfleet equipment: shields, force fields, transporters, and the like.<br /><br />All in all, if you're a Trekkie you might enjoy Enterprise; you might not. Personally I miss the refined class of Captain Picard and the TNG crew; this show rarely achieves the depth of that series, while retaining all its preachiness - which is, by the way, the single most annoying aspect of the show. We've heard enough about racial tensions and unfair treatment and peace treaties and the like on ALL the other series; it would have been nice to have a show not quite so high-minded and preachy in its philosophy. This frequently makes the dialogue unbearably repetitive, particularly Captain Archer's.<br /><br />Enterprise is all right, but I wouldn't spend $100 or so on it. Get yourself the complete DVD set of Joss Whedon's lamentably short-lived Firefly for a third of the price; it's smarter, funnier, more creative, more realistic, and FAR better written, proving that a show about the future doesn't have to filled with aliens and highfalutin preaching about The Higher Way.ng aspect of the show.

B0000508U6|4.0|My gal watched MTV Storytellers which were interviewing and promoting Coldplay the band and it's music and she watched it entirely and was so impressed that when she called me on the phone she raved about this Brittish group and stated I would like this band. So I searched Amazon.com for an album of Coldplay and decided to purchase this album. My girlfriend and I have some same tastes as well as varied taste and in this regard I thought we would be at odds on this choice of music.<br /><br />However I am pleased to state that not only did I love this CD and its bonus video and multimedia videos and enhanced CDROM parts I was liking the sound of this young band. At first they sounded a little like Oasis but soon came out with their own unique tune. The first two songs from this album release 'Don't Panic' and 'Shiver' were tremendous and very moody which is good. Music that has feeling has a purpose and is sung for a purpose. Another well known song which became a singles hit for Coldplay was 'Yellow' which is geared up for the romantics out there. A nice slow dancing song if I ever heard one. 'We Never Chnage' has some great lyrics and a slow harmonic beat that is great to lean back hold your baby in your arms and just cuddle with each other.<br /><br />The bonus tracks are well worth getting with this album if you can. 2 Videos of Yellow. Also included is the acoustic studio version of Yellow. I know one thing and that is Coldplay will be in my CD library for a time to come.

B0009I7NNA|2.0|The biggest problem I have with this cd is the over production by mudrock and the monstrous mixing done by Andy Wallace.  Any rawness (if you will) Avenged Sevenfold used to have has vanished, with acception of course to the length of the songs.  Don't get me wrong, I love a great sounding cd as much as the next guy/girl, but I cannot bear listening to vocal layer after vocal layer, and all layers being 1/4 step higher than the last.  Can you say pop.  Then there is the whining that M. Shadows has learned.....or something.  Not sure what happened.  I HOPE he had vocal surgery....otherwise...Waking the Fallen was pure luck.  I get flashbacks of 80's metal listening to him.  Nothing wrong with 80's metal...but we are in a new era...or at least I'd like to think we are.  Overall, there is a ton of talent on this cd, just a lot of mediocre songwriting, whining, and noise you have to look past to hear it.  A7X has most definately taken a step back and we can only hope they learn from their mistake.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|I know better than to have expectations any time DT puts an album out.  Since every album is unique, this album stands on it's own.  This album has some heavy metal, prog, pop, and much more.  I love DT's approach on this one.  I happen to really enjoy the opener, The Root of All Evil.  This song rocks hard.  Sure they use a bit from Dying Soul, but I thought it was cool.  Don't forget that part of Metropolis was used in Home, and nobody complained then.  The Answer Lies Within is a great song.  It is very mellow, and beautiful in it's own right.  There is no shredding on this one, but who says that DT has to shred on every song anyway.  Hell, Another Day and Surrounded are popish songs that are awesome, yet nobody seemed to complain about those either.  These Walls is another heavy tune, and is probably one of the stronger songs on the album.  I Walk Beside You has a similar vibe to U2, but I really like this song.  If anyone has seen the 5 years in a livetime video, DT does a similar sounding song in their unplugged show in Holland.  I'm not sure what the song was called, but it said something like \\"Tell Me What You're Thinking\\".  That song was awesome, and so is I Walk Beside You.  Panic Attack is a very heavy tune that is fun to listen to.  Never Enough has an awesome solo section where Petrucci and Rudess play in unison.  If you listen carefully, you will hear some of the best soloing I've heard Petrucci do.  Sacrificed Sons is a very beautiful song.  It begins pretty mellow, but builds up to a fury.  This is one of the best songs on the album.  Octavarium is a beautiful song.  There are too many textures to name.  Many of DT's influences can be heard.  People have bitched about this, but every band plays, to some extent, like their influences.  Since I do not believe that DT has a best album, I love this one as Octavarium.  It floors me that people keep complaining that the album isn't IAW or Awake.  Good hell, those albums were great.  Any clone of them wouldmake them lose their meaning.  Likewise for everything that DT has done.  Don't listen to this album with any exceptations.  That way, you will love this innovative offering by the great Dream Theater.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|This is SO exciting! I can't wait until next year when Universal releases the 31st Anniversary Edition of JAWS.  And then I can't wait to plop my money down for the 32nd Anniversayr Edition.  But the BIGGIE, the one I REALLY can't wait to buy is the fantastic 33rd Anniversary Edition.  Now THAT is a DVD worth waiting for!! <br />
B0009I7NNA|4.0|I think this album is a MUSICIAN'S album. It's amazing how many bad ratings and reviews it's getting because Shadows isn't screaming throughout the entire song like everyone else is. If you don't like the album, go listen to Cannibal Corpse or some other mindless grunting and yelling with simple power chords, the same stuff you probably try and imitate with friends in your garage. The guitars shred, the drumming is awesome, and the vocals are something nobody predicted or expected. A great album for those who can respect musicianship.
B00000251N|5.0|I myself, was not familiar with Niel Diamond before this Album.  <br />Although my mother tongue language is not English, I have gotten such a great connection with this work, so I believe that the tongue of our souls is a unique and unbounded tongue. <br />I rank it as THE BEST vocal songs in English I have ever heard. I feel an heavenly inspiration in all pieces , especially in \\"Lonely looking Sky\\" that is really wonderful. Melodies, Compositions, Harmonics, great performance with a 120+ Orchestra, Heavenly voice of Niel Diamond, all together produced such a master piece, that deservs the \\"Jonathan\\" story by Richard Bach.  <br /> <br />I think, if Niel Diamond and all other members of the band have performed just an album in their artistic life, that is \\"Jonathan\\" , their workbook then would be sufficient shiny for all their life that needs no other score.  <br /> <br />An additional note: This is a really price-less work ! you will have a treasure just with afew bucks !  <br /> <br />
B00021R7CG|1.0|Completely ridiculous story.<br /><br />Among all the other implausible stories within this story, is the fact<br /><br />that the presidents helicopter has gone down somewhere in MD., and<br /><br />no one knows where the VP is, nor can they find most of the people<br /><br />in the line of accession. So they make the first senior guy they find<br /><br />the President. Which, as stupid as that is, pales when compared to<br /><br />part of the story that has a male and female B-1 pilots who fly in<br /><br />the same plane, and are lovers. And best (or worst) of all they can't<br /><br />agree about whether they should follow their orders and complete<br /><br />their mission. And of course the story works out so the feel good<br /><br />concept is the one that prevails.<br /><br />The worst films HBO has done. This was a while ago and they have<br /><br />gotten a lot better.
B00005YUPO|1.0|We bought Baby Bach for our daughter when she was 6 months old.  At that time, anything moving on the screen would capture her interest.  Now that she's 13 months, she has no interest in this one at all.  And why should she?  Baby Bach has none of the things that make some of the other Einstein videos great.  It has no puppets, no songs, no animation, no spoken words, and almost no children in it.  This DVD is just plain boring.  It has nothing but shot after shot of random toys and occasionally a not very attractive child.  There is no continuity from scene to scene and the toys have nothing to do with anything going on.  Baby Bach is pure brain candy with no educational value at all and isn't even interesting enough to watch for half an hour.  One positive about this video though is the music.  I happen to enjoy the simplified versions of Bach's songs and think they're a great introduction to classical music for babies.  Next time, though, I would just buy the soundtrack.  It's got much more entertainment and educational value.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|The lack of screaming on this album is only there for one reason... the lead singer had t have surgery on his vocal cords, because he messed them up by screaming. Im almost positive you will never hear him scream again. The music is however amazing, but as everyone has said, the vocals are a big let down. That is the reason though, it is not him trying something different, or following the major label guidelines, its him doing what he has to do... good album though
B00005JNEI|1.0|\\"Now, just for fun, write a 500-word essay distinguishing between Michael Moore and Osama bin Laden -- in the thought department. Could a reasonable citizen possibly wonder whether or not Michael Moore was giving aid and comfort to the enemy? \\" <br /> <br />I don't need 500 words.  I just need this - Michael Moore is different from Osama bin Laden because Michael lives and still remains in the country that he hates so much and benefits off of his government by making millions.  Apparently he is above the country morally, but something about 7 figures a year + 2 mansions, keeps him here.
B0006IIKS0|1.0|A mess.  The video was alright, but the members are pathetic.  My favorite part was Lars explaining that it didn't matter how much his artwork sold for only to get drunk and watch with great anticipation and excitement as his paintings sold for millions.<br /><br />Psychotherapy abounds.  Enjoy.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Look, this is a GREAT album. It's better than AROBTTH. The problem with reading reviews is that half of them are written by intelligent people and the other half are written by complete idiots. Anyone giving this album 1, 2, or 3 stars is just a moron. \\"X&Y\\" is a masterpiece. People who can't recognize good music should just cut their ears off. And those tempted to write lame 1-star reviews should stay away from meaningful instruments like computers. They were not meant to be abused by fools and hacks. Any review with less than 4 stars just skip it, because there's a good chance that the person who wrote it has an IQ less than their rating. With this album, Coldplay has put themselves on a path to greatness. But I guess it takes a great mind to recognize another. This is an excellent album. You're really missing out is you don't have it.
B000084T18|5.0|When Jay-Z wrote \\"Takeover\\" I doubt even he invisioned an invasion like the one 50 Cent launched on the rap world with GET RICH OR DIE TRYING.  With Eminem and Dr. Dre executive producing, the press about his 2Pac like survival of an assasination attempt that left him with 9 holes, his beef with Ja Rule and Murder Inc. and \\"In Da Club\\" bumping anywhere you went this had to be the most hyped rap album since...?  The truth is \\"In Da Club\\" was such a good song and the hype was so huge I was actually somewhat disappointed the first spin of this disc, but after I realized that this wasn't 2Pac or Eminem and listened to it again I realized that while not the  greatest rap album of all time it is a great CD.  50's not the tightest with rymes, but he makes up for it with attitude, lots of controversy and a great laid back flow that any song can benefit from.  With Dre and Em handling the bulk of the production this album runs one classic song right into another.  \\"Many Men\\" is his most Pac-like introspective song revealing his justified paranoia that many men wish death upon him.  \\"Patiently Waiting\\" is produced by Eminem and he delivers an amazing verse that sounds like he's possessed and reaffirms he is still the superior MC, but 50 still shines all over the album.  Other radio staples like \\"P.I.M.P.\\" and \\"21 Questions\\" featuring Nate Dogg confirm the classic status of this album.  50 successfully conquered the industry and put the rap game in a choke hold with this album.
0375507256|5.0|Over 30 years ago, John Fowles broke the fourth wall of literature, beginning Chapter 13 of The French Lieutenant's Woman by answering the question his omniscient narrator had posed at the end of Chapter 12 with, \\"I do not know.\\"  David Mitchell does much the same thing in Cloud Atlas, but without once having to smack the reader in the face with literary technique.  Instead, he breaks off each of the first five of his disconnected but interwoven narratives at the right point, and then lets you in on the secret of the plot, the interconnections of his themes and his final summing up gently and with great care.   <br /> <br />I read this book slowly, savoring each page and each thought Mitchell provided.  The book it most reminded me of was Life:  A User's Manual by Georges Perec, also a set of interwoven tales where the connection between them was left to the reader instead of being provided directly by the author.  Each made me wonder both at the genius of the author and the depth of the issues we confront in our daily life.  At the end of Cloud Atlas, you should be questioning the very choices you have made in your life, the things you have taken for granted and the wrongs you have left uncorrected.  That this can be done in a novel that is at once amusing, infuriating and superbly written says a lot.
B0002SROSQ|4.0|Longtime watchers of the strange career of Nick Cave have to get used to rapid transformations; And yet, Abattoir Blues/ Lyre of Orpheus must strike one as among the greatest surprises of Cave's careers; Just when we've been ready to write him off as a has been, Cave comes back with a vengeance, with the best collection of songs of his career.    I'd dare say that Nick Cave fans have been less then thrilled with some of the recent Nick Cave material;  His pursuit of pop and self parody in 'Murder Ballads', 'Boatman's Call', with good songs but weak performances, and 'No More Shall We Part' which featured one great, classic Cavean track (Fifteen Feet of Pure White Snow) and a few decent tunes, but featured too many overproduced and overplayed songs, with Cave's usual humor and clever lyrics seemingly out of sight.    Things were getting worse with Nocturama, easily the weakest album of Cave's career, which found him with a series of weak, endless ballads ('Rock of Gibraltar', 'Still in Love'), mundane 'alternative' pop ('Bring it on'), and attempts at recapturing the energy of the old punk that sounded forced rather then powerful ('Dead man in my bed').  The announcement of long time Bad Seed Blixa Belgrad's departure seemed to confirm that Nick Cave would settle producing more half hearted, watered down, more-of-the-same.    Oh, sometimes it's great to be wrong.  In retrospect, there were signs for the future also in the bleak years of the early 2000s.  Nocturama's closer, \\"Babe I'm on Fire\\", while grating to some, found Cave at fifteen minutes of pure rock'n'roll;  and the live tour following Nocturama, while focusing of the then latest albums tracks, nonetheless featured interesting straight-forward rock renditions of 'From Her To Eternity' and 'Deanna'.    Abattoir Blues/Lyre of Orpheus finds a metamorphosed Nick Cave.  No longer the Punk bluesman, we get Nick the Rock Star.  The double album is Nick Cave playing it straight.  Of course, straight is a relative concept;  For the uninitiated, the Gospel-on-Speed of 'Get Ready for Love', the weirdness of 'Hiding all the way', and Warren Ellis's flute in 'Breathless' would be anything but straightforward, and this is before we get to the lyrics of murder, incestuous relationships, poisonous snakes, and dining with Cannibals.  Yet, in Cave's terms, this is a visit to a terra nova.  And the results are nothing short of spectacular.    At first, I considered Abattoir Blues to be the winner, while Lyre of Orpheus to be a weaker album.  But now I consider them roughly equal; Abattoir is more solid, but Lyre has two of the three outstanding tracks.    Opening with 'Get Ready for Love', Cave screams of the glory of the divine with a backing of a Gospel choir and pounding drums;  'Cannibal Hymn' is slower but no less powerful, it is poetic and powerful, a great track.  'Hiding it All Away' is a weird, Tom Waits-esque track, while 'The Fable of the Brown Ape' is a song of slaughter in a country side.  The single 'Nature Boy' is pure pop, but it sounds more natural then Nocturama's 'Bring it On', and contains lyrics which are extremely atypical for Cave:    You took me back to your place  and dressed me up in a deep sea diver's suit  You played the patriot, you raised the flag  and I stood at full salute        The Lyre of Orpheus contains a share of duds, like the opening title track, and the overlong, closer 'O Children'.  But it also contains the wonderful ballads 'Easy Money': \\"All the things for which my heart yearns/ Gives joy in diminishing returns\\" and 'Spell', with a repetitive riff barring it from the rank of a classic.    Lyre holds two of the greatest tracks in here, which are among Cave's best:  'Supernaturally\\", which is a hard rockin' track with great lyrics: \\"I chase you up and down the stairs/under tables and over chairs/ reach out and I touch your hair/ and it cuts me like a knife\\".  Even better is Breathless, a beautiful tune of love for the divine: no use talking about how great it is - you must hear it yourself.    And back to 'Abattoir', You can catch Nick Cave at his rocking best, the hardest rocker in Cave's catalogue (with the possible exception of 'Deanna'):  The Improbably titled 'There She Goes My Beautiful World', a song about writer's block and straggling with your muse, featuring Cave's meditation of art and inspiration:     John Wilmot penned his poetry  riddled with the pox  Nabakov wrote on index cards,  at a lectem, in his socks  St. John of the Cross did his best stuff  imprisoned in a box  And Johnny Thunders was half alive  when he wrote Chinese Rocks      His recent records suggest that Cave has known frustrations from his muse, but here he has her very much in grip.
B00003CXCT|5.0|First, Star Wars is a saga wtih 6 chapters. Each chapter tells a story, but all of them together tell the complete story. Don't think of them as \\"original Trilogy\\", \\"prequel Trilogy\\", or \\"Phantom Menace: The worst Star Wars movie ever made\\"(Which I disagree with. Phantom is one of the stronger ones in my opinion, better than episodes II and IV).Even though George Lucas made episodes 4-6 and then 1-3, they should be viewed as a story from 1-6. The changes are great for many reasons. They give the saga continuity. When you view them, you should not think in your head what year they were made. I was born in the 90's and watched the saga in numerical order. Although I was only 9 when episode 1 came out, I fell in love with them. After watching the DVD's and then the old VHS versions, the changes make alot of sence. Trust me. Buy the DVDs and watch them in numerical order FORGETTING that the last 3 were made decades before. You will thouroughly enjoy them and learn to respect the changes. Trust me. Kick back, relax, and watch the DVDs in numerical order. It is so satisfying to watch the saga in it's entirety. If I were to rate the movies from worst to best, it would go as follows:  II: The story seems to do nothing with the plotline of the saga. It is the least important. It's almost like a sidestory. The acting is B movie, and the only saving grace is the beauty of it.  IV: One word, dry. The plot seems to go really slow at times. The acting is okay, but the plot doesn't have alot of depth to it. The changes really help flavor it up, but it's still a little boring.  I: A mediocre movie. It really does a good job of introducing everyone and giving exposition to everything. I also like the CGI effects. There is nothing wrong with Jar Jar. He provides comic relief just like C-3PO. I have no problem with either. The thing I don't like was that it was a little confusing. The trade federation and galactic senate, governor, viceroy, clans, republic; a little too much politics.It adds too much depth.  VI: The better of the movies simply because it delivers with the conclusion. I love the added CGI characters. The things I didn't really like were the ewoks. George Lucas says that he did the ewoks because he couldn't do wookies. I think he should have done wookies or nothing. Also, I didn't like the death star. The death star messed up this film and episode IV. Why put it in this one if it was destroyed in episode IV? Why would the emperor build another one that would be destroyed again? It takes away the shining hope that episode IV had. All in all, a better film. Ian McDiarmid, Mark Hamil, and James Earl Jones have great performances in this.   V: This came very close to being # 1. This movie was fantastic. The gap in greatness between the lower 4 and upper 2 episodes is fairly large. I loved Yoda, Cloud City, and the Empire in full force. Harisson Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Billy Dee pull off fantastic performances. They get alot more screen time than in the other films. Darth Vader and Luke deliver a great climactic final scene. From the battle of Hoth to the battle of Vader, it is a joy to watch. No death star, no ewoks, not boring, not alot of politics, is important to the saga, it has nothing that made the other films worse. Two thumbs way up.  III: I was going to rate this # 2 to 'Empire', but it's only saving grace was the CGI effects. This movie is awesome! It has just the right blend of story and action. I loved Grievous, the Emperor, Kashyyyk, the battle over Coruscant, Yoda, Mustafar, and of course Vader. I love how it ties together everything. Some of the acting was a little sour, but only in a few short scenes. (...)    Well, all in all, the STAR WARS saga is great and think of it as a saga in whole. Thanks for your time and may the force be with you.
B0006L16N8|5.0|What can I say? Simply amazing album. Starting off with the eerie outer space vibe of Square One to the acoustic vibe of Til Kingdom Come, every song is a joy to listen to. It's rare nowadays that bands put out albums that have quality tracks throughout and Coldplay succeeds. Highlights include Square One, Fix You and Swallowed by the Sea. Fix You is slowly becoming my favorite Coldplay song.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|How ironic it was, after purchasing this CD, that I was listening to it in my car when I noticed that I couldn't hear any swearing. I knew there was swearing on the album, but it was conspicuously absent. Knowing the almost parody-like nature of this album, I thought that they might be making some sort of statement by censoring themselves. Then it hit me. I bought the CD from Wal-Mart. Wal-Mart only sells \\"clean\\" CDs. Darn it!    And the irony? The fact that Wal-Mart bothers to carry and edit this CD is an action marked by a deliberate contrast between their apparent and intended meaning.  They will sell the CD and make money on it, but they will only sell the censored version because it is not consistent with their values.  Heck, if they don't like it, they might consider not carrying it at all.    The irony continues. This album is a deliberate slap in the face of all-American materialism, real or imagined. \\"Hey man look at me rockin' out I'm on the radio!\\" they say (*Radio/video*, track 5). \\"Blast off, it's party time! And we don't live in a fascist nation!\\" they cry (*B.Y.O.B*, track 2). Two tracks, *Lost in Hollywood* (track 11) and *Old School Hollywood* (track 10) criticize the inflated importance of Hollywood bygones and the deliberate sexuality that seems to sell products so well. Through a cloak of immorality, System of a Down is... moral, in a way.  Hey Wal-Mart... you guys might be on the same team.    Well, probably not.  But some might enjoy SOaD's effort to make some sort of a statement, political or moral.  Personally, I am a fan of the band. This album isn't as musically solid as some of their previous albums, I'd opine.  \\"Steal this Album!\\" and \\"Mezmerize\\" seem to be considerably more, uh... \\"goofy\\" than \\"Toxicity\\" or their self-titled release. While the message is fairly clear in all of them, they have a different way of expressing themselves with each new creation. Guitarist Daron Malakian seems to fill in a lot more vocals on this album than onothers, and it is usually his voice that reaches the shrill screeching that accompanies crescendo.  Drummer John Dolmayan is amazing, as usual. And bassist Shavo Odadjian must have holes in his fingers from playing so fast. Lead vocals from Serj Tankian are of course incredibly dynamic in their range.     What is this band trying to say? I'm not sure. They're a little too edgy for the mainstream and they ruffle conservative feathers a little too much, but they're on Sony's label and they permit censored CD's to be sold at Wal-Mart. I know, I know... bands can't always dictate how their music is marketed. Nevertheless, I can't help but notice.    They don't quite fit the rock star image, that's for sure. But maybe that's why they're worth a listen. I mean, hey, different is what's IN right now, right?     (Edit: 3/10/07)    Recently I have become irritated with Daron Malakian's screeching on this album and I kind of wish he didn't share so much of the vocals. Usually albums grow with me over time - this one... not so much. It doesn't really match the quality of the band's first two releases, and the vocals should be left to Serj Tankian.
B00082IJ08|5.0|I remember when Clint Eastwood was in regular rotation on MTV, and I very much liked the video, but because of the hip-hop leanings of the music, I never bothered to investigate the group any furthur. Since then my tastes in music have branched out substantially and I'm now ready for my first taste of this band.<br /><br />There actually isn't very much rapping on this album. For some this is a good thing, myself included - I tend to tolerate rapping only if it is over especially good music, since aspects of that vocal style have only recently begun to grow on me. In most parts of this album that involve rapping, it works very well, like on \\"Dirty Harry\\" (over a very intense, almost emotionally driven fuzz bass line.)<br /><br />However, a large portion of this album is more of a trip-hop influenced synth pop. Despite its dance hall groove, \\"Kids With Guns\\" has a bit of a meloncholy edge to it, particularely when the synth arpeggios come in for the chorus. Many of these moments bring to mind the more \\"serious\\" songs the Beatles wrote, such as \\"I'm Only Sleeping,\\" etc. That seems to be the general attitude on this album: fun trip-hop beats underscoring serious lyrical themes and edgy melodies.<br /><br />Some of the standout tracks include the single, \\"Feel Good Inc.,\\" the downtrodden \\"El Manana,\\" the tempermental rap/pop juxtaposition of \\"November Has Come,\\" the danceable \\"Dare,\\" and the creepy spoken word \\"Fire Coming Out of a Monkey's Head\\" (as well as the previously mentioned \\"Kids With Guns\\".) In fact, the only part of this album that throws me off is the slightly awkward album-ending duo of \\"Don't Get Lost in Heaven\\" and \\"Demon Days.\\" I don't hate them, but they just sort of rub me the wrong way. The choir could have been used to great effect but here I think it has reduced these songs to cheesey faux-gospel.<br /><br />I still haven't gotten the self-titled Gorillaz album so I don't know how it compares to this, but I was very impressed by Demon Days and I would recommend the purchase to anyone who is even marginally flexible in their music tastes. 4.5 stars (but I'm nice so I rounded it up.)yone who is even marginally flexible in their music tastes. 4.5 stars (but I'm nice so I rounded it up.)
B0008G2IRO|5.0|Even though I haven't listened to the whole cd yet (I got up to track 10), I believe this album is the one album of the year that you can listen to and expect the unexpected. but to tell the the truth the only other time I listened to them was when they did a remix of one of their songs with D12. I just believed that they were just another band with a rapper in it, but I was wrong. This cd will keep me hooked second after second. The production of this cd is impressive because everything comes together even if it might seem out of place. Man if my friend didn't let me borrow this cd, I would of definitely missed out. All I can saw is that I am going to buy this cd as soon as I get my pay check.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Plain and simple - Coldplay is a hugely talented band.  Their first two albums were moody, melodic gems: a full, bassy, warm sound matched cohesively with Chris Martin's distinctive falsetto to make consistently great pop rock.  The consistency on display on those albums were evidence enough to suggest their 3rd album would be guaranteed to be a quality recording.  And with X&Y, Coldplay has established a reputation as one of the more dependable bands out there.  This one isn't quite as intimate as Parachutes or as melodically sophisticated as A Rush Of Blood To The Head, but is probably their grandest, most dramatic effort yet.  The easiest comparison would be to U2, thanks to the shimmering Edge-esque guitar lines most blatantly displayed on \\"White Shadows\\".  Big shoes to fill, for sure, but Coldplay is certainly up to the task.  Fans of the first two CD's will not be disappointed, although I must admit that this is an overall inferior effort compared with their previous releases.  There really isn't enough to rival 'Clocks', 'The Scientist', 'Politik', 'God Put A Smile Upon Your Face', 'Don't Panic' or 'Trouble' for sheer crowd-pleasing pop genius, although what is here is certainly compelling in its own right.  The opener 'Square One', the stunning 'Talk' and the first two ballads 'What If' and 'Fix You' are my personal favourites, although 'Talk' is the only one that could be considered among their best songs.  The biggest issue surrounding this CD is the final third; things come crashing to a halt with the mundane slice of adult rock radio cheese 'The Hardest Part'.  And while the following three tracks are reasonably pleasant, they aren't striking enough for the album to regain its momentum.  Neither of the first two albums had a dry stretch like this, and that's why I'd rank this album 3rd-best among the 3.  But when the standard has been set so high, this is a slight criticism.  If you're among the tens of millions of fans, do not hesitate to pick this oneup.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I'll tell you guys what.  I really don't care if they sound like the beatles!  If you don't like this music, don't buy it and go listen to whatever it is you guys listen too!!  Jet is an awesome band that is makin some good rock-n-roll music.  The highlights of this listen would have to be Rollover Dj and Cold Hard B****.  Both are really fun to listen too and so is the rest.  So, if you don't care if it sounds like some band from the past and want to listen to some good music, then give this cd a listen.
B0006L16N8|4.0|I have read some harsh reviews on this album, but to me, they are unwarranted.  I hopped on the Coldplay bandwagon quickly after hearing their release 'Yellow' off Parachutes and have been on the Coldplay ride ever since throughout these years.  Going through X&Y, I couldn't help just smiling to myself and saying \\"Damn man, these guys are doing it again with another consistent and very solid effort here.\\"  Songs that jump right out as favorites are 'What If', 'Fix You', 'Talk', 'Speed of Sound' and 'A Message.'  The rest is all very first-rate and still growing on me.  Others like 'White Shadows' and 'Square One' I can see quickly joining that first group of favs with more listens.  And I'm sure from the rest of the batch of songs, a couple more will emerge.  Seriously, they are all that genuine!  I wouldn't say worthy of 5 stars at this point since it's too early to go there really and it does seem a bit of a dropoff from AROBTTH but how could it not be with the quality of that last album?  This shouldn't be compared to that last album as it would be doing it a disservice.  Buy it and enjoy more of the sweeping-moody melodies and beautiful falsettos.  Anyone hating on this may simply be going through a musical taste change.  Two thumbs up from this fan.
B000002N2Z|5.0|A fitting debut for the quartet (at the time) from Sacramento, CA.  This album never ceases to hook me in when I pop in into my cd player.  From the opening riff of \\"bored\\", the album doesn't let up.  That's not to say that it's an amazingly fast album, as songs like minus blindfold, one weak, lifter, birthmark, and fireal aren't quite as rough or fast (but don't get me wrong, they're still pretty rough at points).  It seems as though every song has a killer opening riff that just sucks you in, and it just doesn't let go until the album is done.  Adrenaline isn't as polished as it's descendents, but I don't think that it really takes away from the album's effectiveness.  Adrenaline is a great introduction to someone who is new to the deftones (although I think that any deftones cd is a great start, because every deftones song FEELS like a deftones song).  I honestly don't have a favorite track on this, not because I feel that there isn't one that sets itself apart, just that I feel I wouldn't be doing the other songs justice (it's THAT good).
B000068IEU|4.0|This is one of the few movies I've ever seen where I actually felt sorry for the people on screen who were being killed.  It's really quite pathetic how the poor two girls meet their end, and one almost feels guilty watching it all unfold, as if we too through the act of watching were participating in the atrocities.  For me at least, this was a good thing. It made the movie seem that much more real. <br />  The second half is a bit of a let down, but on the whole the movie is quite unnerving.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Coldplay is my most favorite band in the world, so naturally I couldn't have been more excited to buy their newest cd as soon as it came out.  When I finished listening to the whole thing, I'd have to say that I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't overwhelmingly enthralled either.  I definitely fell in love with the tracks, \\"Fix You\\", \\"What if\\", and \\"Message\\".  Overall, the album lacked the simplicity and grace of the previous 2 records.  X&Y was overcomplicated by heavier noises and sounds, with the exceptions of \\"Message\\" and \\"'Til Kingdom Come\\".  Some tracks are reminiscent of other bands to me (one song in particular which has a danceable quality to it reminded me of the New Wave sound/ Killers, another song reminded me of old school Radiohead with its heavy guitar rift, and track 9 I think reminded me of Ryan Adams with its country-like feel to it.  With this album, there is progression, although they could have taken it to another level by being more creative and break-thruish.  The lyrics are impressive but not as memorable.  The album is great, but not as genious and heartbreaking as A Rush of Blood or as charming and dreamy as Parachutes.  In my opinion, Parachutes is still their best album, and my most favorite one of all.
B0008KLVG4|4.0|So this version marks the 30th anniversary release of Jaws.  It only seems like 5 years ago that we had the 25th anniversary edition... <br /> <br />For those of you complaining about the turnaround on this title, consider how many people have DVD players today that didn't five years ago.  It is a worthwhile re-investment to hardcore fans like myself who found that the previous edition actually came up short on features compared to the lavish 1996 laserdisc box set that had a US$ list price of $130.  That version featured the original mono soundtrack, and the complete two-hour documentary (abridged on the 25th anniversary DVD), and the lack of these features was a sticking point to expectant fans of the first release. This has finally been rectified for the new version, and for folks like me who were disappointed in the remixed/re-recorded soundtrack and the abridged documentary, this disc is well worth the double-dip. <br /> <br />Few people ever really complained about a re-marketed VHS title, simply with new box artwork, and possibly some cross-promtional tie-in material. The content potential of DVD has become a plus and a negative to the modern home video consumer at the same time - \\"why couldn't they include this feature last time\\", etc.  Some titles get even re-issued with less content to bring the price down, so there is no win-win situation.  You have to be your own judge. <br /> <br />Disney was notorious for re-issuing its animated classics every 7 years both theatrically and on home video for a new generation of potential fans, so don't be so quick to judge any studio that uses a number to re-issue a classic film for a new generation of consumers. <br /> <br />Universal is shortly re-issuing The Blues Brothers in a dual-cut edition (Theatrical and extended on the same disc), and I'll be investing in that, too, because while the expanded version was interesting, I still like the flow of the original.  It's what I prefer.
B000002J27|5.0|When does music become magic? When it can transport you to another place far from this world. An escape from everyday problems, where the troubles of the world can be forgotten for almost an hour as you immerse yourself in a landscape of magical music and enchanting stories. Tales of a mythical creature who dissolves in a pool of tears, of a robbery gone wrong, of an alien who finds himself in a strange land inhabited by beings with no horns or tales. The music is timeless, the musicians weave magical spells over the listener and you can almost forgive Phil Collin for the musical dirge of the 1980`s (well almost)  First heard this album as a schoolboy over 26 years ago and it captivated me then. I can go months and sometimes years without listening, but I always know that when I need  to escape from the hassels of modern life, I can reach out for this album and just float away.  Had a hard day at the office? Well do yourself a favour unplug the phone, pour yourself a large drink and listen to this piece of music, for nearly an hour the problems of the world cease to exist.  Thank you to my wonderful friend KJ for encouraging me to write a review on Amazon.
B0006L16N8|2.0|Granted I just got the CD and maybe it will grow on me. First impression, the CD is boring. I will update my review if the CD grows on me, but reading some of the other reviews it doesn't seem likely.    OK, I've listened to the CD about 3 times .... IT'S HORRIBLE! Too bad because I really liked Parachutes and Rush of Blood to the Head. I would have given it 1 star however there are 2 redeeming songs: \\"Speed of Sound\\" and \\"Till Kingdom Come\\".
B00005JNQ8|3.0|Nicole Kidman and Sean Penn star in this murder-for-hire, espionage, who's good - who's bad political thriller.  Set in the United Nations building in New York City, Nicole Kidman plays Silvia Broome, a South African attaché from Motago.  Sean Penn is Tobin Keller, a CIA agent assigned for Silvia's protection. <br /> <br />In the opening sequences, Silvia over hears a possible plot to kill the incumbent leader of her homeland, Motago.  Though not a supporter of the current regime in power, Silvia reports the possible threat to the authorities.  After a series of seemingly unrelated deaths, Silvia's story begins to garner greater respect.  However, when the leading suspect is also murdered in a metro explosion, the possible suspects are no longer clearly apparent. <br /> <br />Directed by Sydney Pollack, the film moves effortlessly through the plot twists and unexpected turns that you come to anticipate in a film of this nature.  I have to admit that the last fifteen minutes of this film do seem a bit extreme and a little tough for even me to swallow; however, I still believe this film is worth viewing.  Not a great film, but a good one nonetheless. <br /> <br />[...] <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|Yes, \\"X&Y\\" is an absolute masterpiece. It's stunningly breathtaking. Coldplay has finally found a sound and songs that suit them perfectly. This is a new era for them. Everything about \\"X&Y\\" is elegant, yet grand. Whatever they did between their last album and this has truly been remarkable. This is their defining moment. A great work of art.
6302516919|4.0|I remember when my mother owned a beautiful red Camaro.  Originally, it had belonged to her late husband who happened to have a passion for Camaro's.  Then he passed away and mom kept it; it was stolen twice, little accidents would happen, sometimes the back hood would pop open while on the road, it locked my baby brother in once -he was 6 months old-, and then finally, one day for no reason, it locked and wouldn't start. <br /> <br />That's when mom decided to sell it.  Despite it being so beautiful it was a pain in the a**! <br />X marks the spot.  Mom soon discovered - through a mechanic- that the car's chassis had been damaged very badly; it was utterly twisted.  This meant that the car had suffered a terrible accident once, and judging from the chassis's condition, the driver's fate had been sealed in that accident. <br /> <br />...While mom's Camaro couldn't repair or rejuvenate itself or drive alone, it still reminds me alot of 'Christine'.  Must be the Red. <br />I watched this film last night and found it to be slightly eerie.  Details will be spared since many reviewers here have been kind enough to provide them.  It's a story about possesion and a boy's twisted love affair with his car.  The film gives 'Christine' the traits of a woman.  She's even filmed the way a young, pretty woman would be (behind and all). <br />But she's also very jealous, revengeful, and lethal.  It's an entirely different kind of story for those that aren't familiar with any of Stephen King's works.  King has the tendency to dwell on the \\"what if's\\" and this clearly allows him to move about and create thrilling story plots like the one's found in Carrie and Christine.   <br /> <br />'Christine' has always been a great story.  But while the film tries too hard to be scary, it fails to convey the horrors found in the novel.  There are some very good scenes, backed by music that intensifies the atmosphere.  Arnie's character is well played.  But the real star of the film nonethelessis the 1958 fiery red Plymouth Fury with a mind of it's own.  I would never believe in nonsense such as a possesed car but everything fits in the possibilities.   <br /> <br />I recommend watching it, but I wouldn't recommend buying it. <br />Like some films, it works the first time.  The second is just for kicks.
B000001ES9|4.0|this is a good and solid Rush album, but it can't compare to their later stuff in terms of complexity and interest.  Yes it rocks hard and good, but you don't really need it if you can get a greatest hits set that has \\"working man\\" and \\"finding my way\\" on it.  \\"working man\\" is still one of their best songs and a consistent concert favorite that never fails to please.  I think it is amazing that the band was able to craft such a good song with such lasting power even though Neil hadn't joined yet.  If you want to get all the albums, you should defininitely get this one in addition to the rest.  If you are just picking and choosing, you can go ahead and pass this one over.
B00005ATQD|5.0|The implicit idea of the film is just one: Is the woman of these modern times absolutely of her omnipresence and faculty to decide the absolute domain of her sexuality? The rest of the film tries to find some clues.<br /><br />The total domain of any relationship resides almost by desereved right, in whom loves less. The other may be love more but the other loves best. The fidelity is, in last instance, a very fragile equilibrium state; and the desperate behavior of the male counterpart exhibits those fissures. The hell of the mind plays an important and decisive role trying to seek and wonder why the countless attitudes of the female behavior.<br /><br />Stanley Kubrick focused this interesting aspect displaying all his huge cinematographic power: as a visual director and creator of atmospheres and stages, he confronts us with this painful fact, but along the film you will discover the reality and fantasy may be blend. Somehow this film reminded immediately to Bergman's Scenes of a marriage; the script deserved perhaps a major scope. The master crossed the line but I think he did not advance with that sure step so typical of his previous film. That lack of decision may be seen as the main ingredient that affects the climax, because the wave was not appropriately high and strong to reach the ecstasy. That's why the last line of the film made you left the hall with a floating riddle in your mind. Perhaps this was precisely the intention of Kubrick, but having known so well all his previous works, you maintain the doubt.<br /><br />This complex and mature film had two serious failures. One of them was the role of Cruise. For some reason Kubrick had to repeat several times some sequences of the picture; that means something very remarkable because all of we know about the love of Kubrick for the perfection.<br /><br />In the other hand it was very hard to believe the locations in Pinewood to assume New York.<br /><br />Anyway the last Opus of this master director was the pivot for Nicole Kidman who became in a solid actress since this picture.or Nicole Kidman who became in a solid actress since this picture. <br /> <br />  <br />
B0006L16N8|1.0|I had such high expectations for this album. <br /> <br />Power Chords and Zen happy lyrics simply don't cut it. <br /> <br />Coldplay needs to re-evaluate themselves musically. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay's latest \\"X & Y\\" is a one great addition into anyone's music collection.     This era's Pink Floyd brings to you their masterpiece ballads connected with heart felt and genuine lyrics that create Coldplay's beloved signature sound, that keep you coming back for more.    Songs like \\"Speed of Sound\\" and \\"Fix You\\" make you appreciate the actual talent of the band and the real composing geniuses at work. Like Pink Floyd much emphasis goes into the composing process of each song and you can tell each beat and melody has been crafted and molded to perfection.     For people to even say that this CD is \\"Boring or Slow\\" really lack the mental capacity to realize the sheer power of the songs, do not be fooled by others if you are in fact a Coldplay fan or just a fan of this genre of music this CD will not disappoint.
B0007DAZW8|4.0|Alot of this reviews for this album have been rather negative. Some have said the sound is reminescent of Homework, and others have said they have completely changed, and usually not for the better. I agree with some aspects of both of these ideas, and yet I still see many similarities to Discovery that I think many listeners have overlooked. <br /> <br />I will now give a brief opinion of each track. I hope this helps those who are not hardcore fans decide if this album is something they might enjoy. <br /> <br />1. Human After All: The title, track, and rightly so. This song is likely to become at least marginaly recognized among non-fans. It features(as usual) a highly vocoded, minimal set of lyrics, which was common on Homework. But this track is also very similar to the sound and progression of many of the tracks from Discovery. You are immediately introduced to the albums new, grungier and at the same time more synth laden sound. <br /> <br />2. Prime Time of Your Life: Very similar to the first track in many respects. Perhaps, too similar. It will be common for many listeners to be unable to distinguish many of these tracks at first. Prime Time demonstrates early on that the album is a little too homogenized. Aside from this, it is still one of the more addictive songs on the album. <br /> <br />3. Robot Rock: Probably the most blended of Homework and Discovery styles. It has a highly repetitive sound, and a light groove. It features a degnerating clarity found n both previous albums. Its one interesting quality is its resemblance to Harder Bestter Faster Stronger(Discovery) in that the vocals seem to blend seemlessly into guitar sounds. While HBFS blended with a guitar solo(one of the most exciting moments in all of Daft Punk's work) Robot Rock turns the two words featured in the song into powerchords. At tims the vocals drop completely, and then slowly become more prominent. <br /> <br />4. Steam Machine: This song should have never been concieved, let alone recorded, and certainly, never relased on a musical album. The single most obnoxious song Daft Punk has ever created, surpasing Teachers (Homework) solely because it is also nearly five and half minutes long. <br /> <br />5. Make Love: This song is very similar to the later tracks on Discovery. Lacking lyrics, and a having a very light beat. This song also is probably the most reliant on melody of any of the Human After All tracks. Very chilled and relaxed. <br /> <br />6. The Brainwasher: During this song, you will want to yell out \\"IRONMAN!\\" several times. Another very dirty sounding track, and yet still less industrial than most of the Homework songs. This song is like the rolling hills of Pensivlania: You always seem to be going uphill very slowly, but you never seem to gain any elevation. Extremely anti-climactic. <br /> <br />7. On Off: a 19 second clip of a television changing channels. This is a setup for the next track, though I am puzzled why it is not included on Television Rules the Nation, and is instead given its on track number. This reminds me very much of Eiffel 65's early intros. <br /> <br />8. Television Rules the Nation: This song might just turn your brain to mush with its hypnotic sound and simple beat. The only song with a clear and simple message. One of my favorites because it simply sounds pleasing. Not overly exciting however. <br /> <br />9. Tecnologic: Done with the same vocal stylings of Teachers, but without the extremely annoying feeling. This song has more unique words than any other track on the album, and yet feels more repetitive than most. Any geek will love this song for all of its technical references. A good listen the first time, but you may find yourself skipping it on subsequent listenings. <br /> <br />10. Emotion: Another very Discovery sounding track, but also much like some of the more musical songs from Homework. A very mellow way to end an album, which seems to be Daft Punk's style. Generaly I like this song, but once again, I must say that it is nothing special or exciting. <br /> <br />I do like this album, and most of the songs, while getting bad descriptions, are actually very addicting. The whole album is more laid back than either fo the previous two, and you will find yoruself at the end of the album wondering where it all went. I suggest it on loop in the background while you are working on something. <br /> <br />Unfortunately there are no standout songs, like there on Homework. And nothing like the opening four tracks of Discovery. If those where what you found appealing about Daft Punk, then I suggest you get Interstella 5555, the DVD that accompanies Discovery, and lay off this album. But if you are a hardcore fan, or you like some of the more hypnotic synthy sounds of both albums, then you will certainly enjoy this one.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|This album is a waste
B0009A1AS2|5.0|DREAM THEATER\\"S newest disc entitled \\"octavarium\\" first impressions aside, is a killer disc.  It has the classic Dream Theater sound, yet also is a very distinctive record.  One of the downfalls of this record is that it isnt as heavy as Train of Thought it, as its very keyboard and vocally driven, and John Petrucci doesn't solo as much as he usually does, somthing i orginally missed.  But when he does solo, he was able to create new, unique guitar solos which aren't just the same old same old, and don't follow the classic Petrucci sound, which is something I really admire because it shows once again what a magnificent musician he is.  Overall i do really enjoy this cd, and strongly reccommend it. The track \\"panic attack\\" is a true standout on this disc.  Dream Theater cant make the same cd over and over, that would be pointless, and Octavarium is a standout disc by Dream Theater in my opinion.
B0000027RL|5.0|Pearl Jam's best album and the best of of the Big 4's signature albums (Nevermind, Ten, Dirt, Superunkown). Nirvana defined grunge with their look, and Soundgarden and Alice in Chains were heavy metal bands, but this album is the epitome of the grunge scene and a prize of Generation Xers everywhere like myself. <br /> <br />With the release of Lost Dogs and a computer, one can alter the disc running order a bit to include the good songs that did not make it on the album but were recorded at the same time. Doing this gives the listener a sense of how creative and talented these guys were. The new playlist: <br /> <br />Once <br />Even Flow <br />Alive <br />Why Go <br />Black <br />Jeremy <br />Oceans <br />Wash <br />Dirty Frank <br />Porch <br />Alone <br />Garden <br />Deep <br />Footsteps <br />Yellow Ledbetter <br />Release <br /> <br />Try to tell me this is not the best band of the 90s.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I've been a big fan of Coldplay ever since \\"Yellow\\" hit the radio waves back in the 90's. Parachutes was fantastic, but A Rush of Blood to the Head was what sealed the deal for me. That album has been consistently in my CD player for the past three years, and so as you can imagine, it was very difficult for me to not help comparing X&Y to AROBTTH.  <br /> <br />So here are the main differences: There is much more guitar and drum work, Chris Martin's vocals are more prominent (previously, his voice fused with all the instruments, but this time around it seems like he takes his \\"lead singer\\" role more seriously), and overall the album has a more mature sound. <br /> <br />The first time I listened to X&Y through, the three songs that jumped out at me were \\"Talk\\", \\"Fix You\\" and \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\". I'm not a huge fan of \\"The Hardest Part\\" - but then again, fans of this band tend to have a lot of different opinions on their tracks.  <br /> <br />For hardcore AROBTTH fans, you shouldn't be disappointed in this as long as you keep an open mind. Coldpaly's ballads are just as sweet and easy on the ears as previous ones such as \\"The Scientist\\", while the rockier tracks are still very \\"Politik\\"-esque. In short, the magic of Coldplay is not lost in this album. <br /> <br />But keep in mind that AROBTTH was a completely original accomplishment - and that its singles have made this band mainstream. This is not, I repeat, NOT A Rush of Blood to the Head again. This is new, this is experimental, and this is absolutely gorgeous music produced by a talented band that obviously puts a heck of a lot of dedication into their work.  <br /> <br />If your first impression is that the songs all sound alike or whatnot, my advice to you is to listen to it again. And again. And again. And after that, I'm sure you won't be needing me to tell you to replay X&Y over and over again.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay is a complicated band. It took nearly three years and two subsequent albums to fully appreciate just how complex they are.     The unexpected success of A Rush Of Blood To The Head afforded the band the ability to be a bit more pretentious with the media. Rather than subjecting themselves to more mind numbing and cumbersome interviews, as they had to endure for A Rush Of Blood To The Head, Coldplay developed a new tactic; they became more elusive.     It's apparent that they became fatigued with the minutia that came along with being the world's most important band. I'm sure you've heard the stories of how they incorporated the practice of only speaking with select members of the press through their website; and when they did choose to interact, they only answered questions they deemed interesting. Make no mistake; Coldplay had achieved iconic status, a fact that they were keenly aware of.    On X & Y you'll find a band that has created a vivid soundscape that takes you to the outer reaches of their collective imaginations and leaves you there, with a feeling of utter desolation. The album is more expansive and experimental than A Rush Of Blood To The Head.     Only they've created it not so much with words as they have with the music, the music itself tells a story. It serves as an auditory hallucination as you begin to drift in and out of consciousness; replaying fragmented movie stills of your life as you wait to expire, some familiar, and some from the aforementioned crash. You must listen to this album.
B000007T1M|4.0|I got this cd after i got toxicity. i think i wouldve liked this better if i got it first, its not bad though. some songs have got the classic SOAD sound to them. Serj hasnt quite found his voice yet but its not far off from what it sounds like on the other albums. the music is very good as it is on all SOAD cds. the lyrics are really, really, really weird. of course this is just what system does. it proves that they are not afraid to do something different, something very different. they write their songs about something other than how much anger they are feeling or how much they hate a certain someone like many other rock bands out there do now. i only gave this 4 stars because as a whole, this does not have system's classic sound yet. heres a rating and description of all the songs: <br /> <br />1. suite-pee 8/10- good opener, lyrics are messed up but they are an all the songs so im not complaining. <br /> <br />2. know 8/10- the guitars are pretty good on this song but are kinda repetitive. <br /> <br />3 sugar 9/10- \\"the kaboocha mushroom people\\"(?), ending on this song is great, heavy <br /> <br />4 suggestions 6/10- a lot like spiders, they dont go well after each other <br /> <br />5. spiders 10/10- i think this song might have the least messed up lyrics of them all, soft and slow at first but then picks it up a little more towards the end. <br /> <br />6. Ddevil 7/10- short, \\"shake your spear at shakespear\\", i love the line \\"stupid people do stupid things, smart people outsmart each other, then themselves\\", sounds like Serj is chirping during parts of the song <br /> <br />7. soil 7/10- cool song, fast <br /> <br />8. war? 9/10- this is one of my favorites, pretty heavy, reminds me of \\"prison song\\", too short though <br /> <br />9. mind 7/10- slow at first the picks it up but it is too long though. <br /> <br />10. peephole 6/10- theres a tuba or something in this one, kinda strange <br /> <br />11. cubert 7/10- a little different from the rest of the songs, lyrics are kinda repetitive but its only about 1 minute and 49 seconds long <br /> <br />12. darts 7/10- cool song, i like the main riff, not much to say about it <br /> <br />13. P.L.U.C.K. 10/10- heavy and fast, good way to end the cd, sounds the most like the stuff on toxicity.  <br /> <br />top 5 favorites: P.L.U.C.K., spiders, war, sugar, suite-pee
B00082IJ08|2.0|The first Gorillaz album was a revelation of musical fusion. Ranging from hardcore hip hop to catchy pop tunes, and even classic punk, Dan the Automator seemed proved he was able to wrangle the widest range of sounds into a cohesive, hip, fun, and at times downright moody album. Spiced up with his signature sound effects and grooving beats he was the perfect match for a group led by four cartoon characters. Danger Mouse, unfortunately, doesn't quite take to the project as naturally. While arguably more talented, boasting a greater depth than Dan the Automator, he lacks the inventive, catchy hooks and flat out panache of the out there experimentation the Gorillaz relied on before. With this album it feels as though the quartet have tried to move on, but they have not moved quite far enough. Danger Mouse doesn't seem to know exactly where to go, confined to sampling sounds that are trademark Gorillaz and bland beats that go nowhere. There are a few catchy tunes here, but ultimately nothing as groundbreaking as their first album. I can only hope their next album moves beyond into fresher territory, or, at the very least, back into the familiar Gorillaz realm. And that we don't have to wait quite as long.
B000001C6M|5.0|this is my first slayer cd and i think that it is great. i know that its not their best, but if this is as good as it is, then i cant imagine how good some of their later releases are. this album starts off very strong with \\"evil has no boundaries\\" and a high pitched scream by tom. a great song with a nice heavy beat (i love when \\"evil\\" is chanted during the chorus.) this song is followed up by \\"the antichrist\\" which is also a strong track with tom's high pitched scream in the chorus. the next two tracks \\"die by the sword\\" and \\"fight till death\\" are some of my favorites on the cd. the next song \\"metalstorm/face the slayer\\" is one that i usually overlook. the next two tracks are great (tormentor being my overall favorite track.) i find the last 3 tracks are the lows points of the disc, \\"the final command\\" being more noise than anything, \\"crionics\\" sometimes being overlooked by me and the title track being the best of the three, with a killer drum solo by Dave Lombardo as the intro, a good fight song. overall, this cd is amazing. it was the kind of music that was starting to sound a little old in its time, but this different than others from then, faster and more aggressive. Dave Lombardo has got to be one of the best drummers that there ever was in metal. kerry and jeff's guitar playing is amazing, it fits perfect with tom's singing. this is a great original thrash album and will go down as a classic.
B00097A5HW|5.0|I have to admit that when I first heard this CD, I wasn't too fond of it, mostly cuz it sounded nothing like her old stuff, so i wasn't familiar with it. But, to tell you the truth, if an artist keeps releasing albums that sound the same as the previous, then they're not really doing their job, are they?  And every single song on this album sounds completely different, which is a feat in itself. This album is really growing on me and I like it more and more every time i hear it. I definately can't wait til Oral Fixation, volume 2 comes out.
B00007E8V4|5.0|its hard to believe that these are songs that were left out from other albums. i dont have mesmerize yet but this is SOAD's best one yet. the first song chic 'n' stu is funny as hell, i mean its about pizza! thats why i love this band, they are different. its got some really great songs on it like innervision which is my favorite on the disc and possibly my favorite SOAD song. bubbles is cool along with A.D.D. my least favorite on the cd would be boom!. it just doesnt have the same pace as the rest of the songs. i was kinda dissapointed with the length of this however, i mean 16 songs, that should last a while. but this only clocks in at about 43 minutes the great songs more than make up for that though.  <br /> <br />top 5 favorites: innervision, A.D.D., mr. jack, bubbles, streamline
B0001NBMBC|5.0|Words cannot describe how much I respect Slipknot for this compilation of ingenius tracks. The CD is flawless. It's very appearent that Slipknot has matured as a band, and is putting great effort into making stellar tracks, and it's greatly reflected in this CD. Every, and I mean, EVERY single song on this CD is worth listening over and over. It's rare I find a CD I can put on, and listen from beginning to end without having to skip tracks. Not only that, I can listen to this CD once it's finished over and over. <br /> <br />The nu-metal style and feel in this CD is appearent, but it's not mainsteam AT ALL. Slipknot has totally defined their music as something that deserves it's own genre. The heavy guitar riffs in combination with the hard hitting bass and drum with that pinch of melodic twist makes you feel as if you want to create something beautiful, then destroy it. They sound like no one, and no one sounds like them. Purely, and completely genius. I've always enjoyed Slipknot music, from Mate, Feed, Kill, Repeat to IOWA, but nothing has captivated me like this CD.  <br /> <br />If you aren't a Slipknot fan, you will be after this CD.  <br />If you are a Slipknot fan, this is f!@&ing auditory esctacy.  <br /> <br /> <br />I've never in my life been more impressed with any artist. Ever.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|As a huge fan of DREAM THEATER since 1992,i feel that i am qualified to give you my opinion on the new CD \\"Octavarium\\".It, as with all of past dream theater albums,deserves 5 stars simply because they are the greatest band in rock today and will continue to be the greatest as long as they are around.SIMPLE AS THAT!!! To all the so-called \\"fans\\" who are dissapointed with the new album,all i can say is go grab the new \\"BACKSTREET BOYS\\" CD and leave the real music reviews to people who know great songs when they \\"hear\\" them.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|OK, I gave the film 5 stars not the 30th anniversary edition.<br /><br />If you're like me and fairly bi-polar you know what mania is all about. \\"Should I buy the latest and greatest?\\" How often I've asked myself this question as I'm standing in line at Best Buy with a new remote control that does nothing different than my old one. The point being, what's the point? I say who needs it. One of the other reviwers was salavating over this edition having a \\"Mono\\" track. If anything that's a reason NOT to buy it. At least wait 10 years in between special editions.
0226264211|4.0|Although he never uses the term, Milton Friedman would probably be considered a libertarian with his view of a very limited Federal government. The main responsibilities of the Fed would be establishment and enforcement of laws, resolving property rights and maintaining the monetary system. Mr. Friedman considers himself a defender of `classical' liberalism which is essentially the liberalism of the 17th century that concerned itself with the distribution of power, protection of property rights and freedom of individuals.<br /><br />As the heir apparent to Fredrick A. Hayek, Mr. Friedman takes up the battle against socialism, central planning and the concentration of power. Unlike his predecessor, however, Milton Friedman is extremely specific about the changes he would like to see in the way the U.S. government governs. He would like to see the elimination of rent control, minimum wage, the FCC, Social Security, most business regulations, tariffs on imports, public housing and national parks. Friedman was also an early proponent of school vouchers. In fact he goes so far as to call for the complete `denationalization' (privatization) of public education. The main thrust of Mr. Friedman's argument is that when the government attempts to solve social problems through central planning it invariably causes more problems than it solves, restricts individual freedoms and consolidating power in central planners.<br /><br />There is an almost mystical reverence in this book for market forces and their ability, if left alone, to solve practically any social ill including racism. The problem is that Friedman presupposes that business will be forced to act in a rational and benevolent manner in order to maximize profits and survive in a competitive marketplace. Unfortunately this is often not the case. Businesses in the south were more than willing to forgo money offered by blacks. As a pro-business liberal Mr. Friedman sees regulations that force shops to hire blacks as unfair and damaging to those businesses that \\"[serve] a neighborhood inhabited by people who have a strong aversion to being waited on by a Negro clerk\\". However, Mr. Friedman's argument can be turned around as unfair and anti-capitalistic to blacks who offer their services and are denied based on race. This would apply to anyone barred from the marketplace, not just blacks.<br /><br />Milton Friedman is so pro-business that he advocates a complete elimination of corporate taxes. In his mind business owes nothing to society and even says, \\"there is one and only one social responsibility of business - to use its resources and engage in activities to increase its profits\\". He then goes even further stating that, \\"Few trends could so thoroughly undermine the very foundation of our free society as the acceptance by corporate officials of a social responsibility other than to make as much money for their stockholders as possible\\". Not only does Friedman encourage unbridled greed he makes it the number one corporate responsibility in order to protect \\"free society\\". Once a person accepts that the relentless pursuit of self interest is the best thing a person can do for society he or she can justify just about anything.<br /><br />One part of the book that seems particularly dated is Friedman's claim that Capitalism reduces wealth disparity. In fact he holds up the United States as a model for wealth equality. If only this were true. He completely ignores the real and growing threat to freedom brought on by the concentration of wealth because he doesn't see it as a problem. The average voting age citizen is welcome to vote for whichever party they choose at which point the parties in power will adjust policy to the needs of wealthy donors. The Bush administration has turned this it into an art form. Friedman also expresses concern that, \\"a large fraction of the public scrimps in their productive years to provide themselves with a higher standard of living in old age than theyever enjoyed in the prime of life\\". Mr. Friedman should be pleased to know that 40+ years after the books publication a large percentage of American's have more debt than assets.ever enjoyed in the prime of life\\".

B00025ETIW|3.0|My Chemical Romance's first album, \\"I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love\\" was an excellent screamo album, and it is single-handedly responsible for getting me to respect the genre more. Then they released the way too poppy, horribly mediocre pop-punk effort \\"Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge\\" which is decent at best. Gerard hardly screams at all throughout the entire thing, and the vaguely hardcore-ish riffs of the first album were sacrificed for pop-anthem melodies. MCR's once beautifully dark and dysnfunctional lyrics became your run-of-the-mill emo lyrics. However, the album is saved by a few standout tracks, like \\"You Know What They Do To Guys Like Us In Prison\\", which, even though poppier than their old stuff, makes use of their once witty writing style and pulls of a pretty damn good song, and \\"I Never Told You What I Do For A Living\\", which has that once loved maliciously dark feel to it. The album was a huge letdown, but that didn't stop it from leading MCR to major sellout status and garnering them a huge legion of fans hailing them as the greatest emo band ever. The bottome line is, I fail to see why everyone thinks this album is so great, and I don't understand why this, not their first, more creative record, propelled them to super-stardom.
B000026FOA|2.0|Nick Drake was a minor talent when alive, and death hasn't changed that one iota.  He sings in a Donovan-like moribund drone, the arrangements are lacklustre, and most significantly, there's a definite lack of emotional connection between the music and the listener.  His music is strictly \\"emperor's new clothes;\\" people want to see something there, when there's little to nothing. <br />
B00063MBU8|1.0|There should be a law making it illegal for Simple Plan to write music. That way, people wouldn't be tortured by their boring, unoriginal lyrics and laughably elementary music. Plus, they would stop disgracing the real punk bands of the underground because, for, some God awful reason, people throw them into that category. Simple Plan is a joke of a band who seem to only write whiny songs about their \\"hard life\\". Why don't they just grow up, stop writing immature albums (Still Not Getting Any? Dude, last time I checked, you guys had graduated junior high), and realize that music is not their collective forte. That is, unless you like bland, boring, annoying pop-rock.
B0006L16N8|5.0|First off, if you have not listened to the entire album at least five times completely, you have no business writing a review. As any TRUE Coldplay fan will know, most of thier songs are so brilliant because they get BETTER over time. X and Y is no exception. Although at first listen some songs jump out at you as Coldplay classics (Square One, What If, Fix You, X and Y and Swallowed By the Sea), other songs become better each time they are played (White Shadows, Til Kingdom Come, Low).  <br /> <br />I challenge any one to listen to the ending of Fix You and not put it in your Top Five of Best SOngs of All Time.  <br /> <br />My hats off to Coldplay who not only put out an album of epic music but who have stayed together as a band to bring the world great music. Such a shame such greats as Guns and Roses and The Beatles couldn't do the same. <br /> <br />The album gets under your skin to the point of obsession with each spin of the CD. Awesome job, guys!
B000000WA4|3.0|Now that several years have passed since the release of Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness, the albums signifigance is easier to put in to perspective.  This album would've been a phenominal album...an album being a 13-15 track single CD.  It would have been lush with melody, and chock full of songs you wouldn't forget.  The fact that it is a 28 track double album takes it down a couple of notches.  There are several tracks on this sprawling album that are either boring, redundant, or unnecessary.  What makes it worse is that most people don't even get into the meat of the second album because they have been oversaturated with all of the other material in the album.
0783225903|1.0|If you like never ending and story less tales that inspire only the hope that this movie has more to offer than confusion alone, than this tale is for you. This movie was meant to be visually stunning but for 1985 you will be fairly disappointed-Back to the future came out the same year and was far more stunning in my opinion, although maybe not \\"artistically stunning\\" like some say. I don't know what classifies as science fiction in 1985 but this is definitely not it, this should be classified as science crap that is incredibly uninteresting. I already wasted my time with this lengthy movie, please, save yourself.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Yes, Yes I know, X&Y sounds a lot like their past efforts, but honestly this music still feels fresh and intriguing despite the fact that their formula hasn't changed that much from their early days.  However, I would dispute those who say that Coldplay haven't altered there sound at all. <br />    Songs Such as Square One see Coldplay exploring sonic territory.  Sure it's not that experimental, but it adds a new depth to their sound, instills fans with the belief that Coldplay still has fresh territory to discover. <br />    So in summary this record won't change the face of music, but it is a great listen despite that.  Every track on this CD is enjoyable, but personal favorits are: Fix You, Swallowed in the Sea, and Talk <br />
B000002NIW|5.0|Well, when you listen to their debut \\"Adrenaline\\" and this album, \\"Around The Fur,\\" back to back, you can hear a major difference. The mere two years between albums seem to have allowed for much improvement, as this is an amazing band that got even better. \\"Around The Fur\\" is more like the band you know today. All of the familiar elements are here, and the band is in top form, and with much better production (ironically, by Terry Date, who was also behind \\"Adrenaline\\"). I really don't think, no matter how hard I tried, that I could find a flaw in this album. I just love it too much. Each and every song, all the way to \\"Damone,\\" the hidden track (which you have to travel roughly 30 minutes past the final song to reach) are perfect and are the definition of the Deftones.<br /><br />The most important thing to notice on this album is Stephen Carpenter's guitarwork. If you thought he was good on \\"Adrenaline,\\" try this album on for size. His riffs are even better, and his work seems to carry this entire album, providing the mood. Take for example, that classic riff of \\"My Own Summer (Shove It)\\" which perfectly translates the feeling of being out in the scathingly hot sun and hating every minute of it. Over time, I've come to the realization that Carpenter is one of the best guitarists in his genre, not because of technical skill, but because he serves the songs so well. Hell, even Max Cavalera, who guests on \\"Headup\\" (which marks the birth of his current group Soulfly's name) has trouble outshining him. But you can't forget frontman Chino Moreno, as his vocals have vastly improved (not to mention, his lyrics). He sounds so much smoother and seems to handle the aggressive moments even better. He even gets his own shot at showing off his voice on the melodic \\"Be Quiet And Drive (Far Away)\\" and the subdued \\"Mascara.\\" The combination of both Moreno and Carpenter (not to slight the rest of the guys) is really the essential make-up of Deftones. And \\"Around The Fur\\" confirms this.<br /><br />As for the songs on this album? Well sorry, I spent so much time talking about why it's so great, I didn't quite cover that. But you already know the songs, and if you don't, you really should. This is more of a retrospective, nostalgic trip for me. As I know this album so well, I'd rather talk about what makes it so great. I vividly remember this album leaving me in high-aniticpation for 2000's \\"White Pony.\\" I had the kind of hopes that were so high, they were just begging to be crushed, thankfully they weren't, but this album is just that good. After listening, you're going to be salivating, and desperate for more.As for the songs on this album? Well sorry, I spent so much time talking about why it's so great, I didn't quite cover that.

AEROSMITH ARE BRILLIANT AND ROCK!!!!.
B000002N2Z|5.0|Well, out of the Deftones (so far) four albums, \\"Adrenaline\\" sticks out the most. To be quite honest, it sounds rather removed from the other places Deftones have been in their ten year period within the music biz (although, 2003's self-titled album did stray back to the 'tones roots a bit).  It doesn't have much going in the melody department, and it's not really all that experimental. The production, along with the mixing job, leaves a bit to be desired, and frontman Chino Moreno's lyrics make less and less sense the more I hear them. So why do I consider this a great album? How did the Deftones become, not only one of my favorite bands, but a band that seems to instantly affect people the minute they hear them, and fall in love?<br /><br />Well, good music doesn't always have to be clean or easy on the ears. Although their following albums were cleaned up considerably, and sounded the better for it, \\"Adrenaline\\" is still great in it's own way. Take, for example, Helmet. Helmet are a pretty well respected band in the hard-rock/heavy-metal community. I would consider them cornerstones of the 90's metal movement, and Hell, they even unwittingly started the nu-metal movement. A group that has massive appeal, is respected by anyone who listens. But their records sound rather bad. Production that is almost not there, with vocals that are treated like crap, but yet, at the heart of it, really powerful and engaging music. Now maybe you understand where Deftones are with their 1995 debut, \\"Adrenaline.\\" Sure, there are elements of their newer self, signs of what was to come, but this is hands down, their heaviest work (hence the title). There's still a bit of variety however. Take songs like \\"Fireal\\" and \\"Minus Blindfold,\\" which tinker with the quiet to loud dynamic pioneered by Nirvana, or \\"Engine No. 9\\" and \\"7 Words,\\" which are the closest the band veers into rap-metal territory -- unless you consider Chino's collaboration with Korn, covering Ice Cube's \\"Wicked.\\" The boy can rap. \\"Lifter\\" and \\"Root\\" are probably the most metal of the album, espcially \\"Root\\" with it's speedy guitar riff. Guitarist Stephen Carpenter has always expressed his preference for heavy metal, and has been known to creatively butt heads with Moreno. He must love this album the most, as his fingerprints are all over this album, even if his guitar work has vastly improved over time.<br /><br />Every song is great it's own right (even the semi-instrumental hidden track), and that's why, despite it's imperfections, this is a 5-star album for me. It's a great start for this band, who are true underdogs of the scene. Even when their peers blew up in the late 90's, they never quite got theirs. And Hell, considering the current music scene, I'm sure if this album was released today, it would be a massive hit. But what-ifs aside, \\"Adrenaline\\" is but a taster of what is to come. It is merely one face of a multifaceted group. Just give it a few listens before you dismiss it.oy can rap. \\"Lifter\\" and \\"Root\\" are probably the most metal of the album, espcially \\"Root\\" with it's speedy guitar riff.

B0007Y08IS|2.0|Proceeding from Trey Parker, Team America offers some creditable South Park humor. The attractive subtitle promises to 'ridicule everybody'. 'Everybody', it turns out, mostly includes Kim Jung Il. (One would expect the easier target, Bush, to at least show. No such luck.) Since it is difficult to properly ridicule the North Korean dictator, whose evildoings are only vaguely familiar to the American audience, the burden of satire turns to the supposedly univeral Asian tendency to mispronounce all 'L's as 'R's. (I so ronery. I have pran.) For nearly half an hour, what seems to be the bulk of the movie is spent repeating that one joke--200 times or so, and the joke goes from old to sadistic to simply tiring. The last third of the plot consists of head explosions and dismemberments, in their full bloody glory, of anti-war Hollywood stars, one at a time. These scenes may succeed in entertaining either middle schoolers who consider any form of cruelty the highest form of funny, or right wingers who attain to masturbatory revenge on all Bush critics. It is disturbing to see the creators of South Park-and not Bill O'Reiley-equate all criticism of Bush with terrorist membership. Making fun is one thing, misinforming people about an honest cause is another. (In a public letter, Sean Penn shrugged off the ridicule, but invited the creators of the movie to join him on a trip to war zone countries. Witnessing real people getting their guts blown to pieces may not be that funny, after all.) It has been said that moral failure usually comes from intellectual deficiency, but this cannot be said of the creators of South Park, who have repeatedly proven themselves with clever socio-political commentaries. For Team America, a more proper word is not deficiency, but decrepitude.

B0006L16N8|5.0|In comparing Coldplay's work to the that of Radiohead, I believe this album is more reminiscent of the Bends than OK Computer.  Where Radiohead had beautiful ballads such as \\"High and Dry\\" and \\"Fake Plastic Trees\\", X&Y boasts \\"What If\\", \\"Fix You\\" and \\"A Message.\\"  What is most the common is that both albums contain both memorable anthems and more tender moments.  Both albums hint at experimentation yet the focus is mostly on the songs and X&Y is FULL of great songs.  As well as the ones mentioned, heavier tracks such as \\"White Shadows\\" and \\"Square One\\" are also memorable. X&Y is just another stepping stone in Coldplay's evolution into greatness.
B00097A5I6|1.0|only good song was lyla and even that was no good, im onna pre order the new offspring album instead!
B0006L16N8|5.0|Thankfully, most reviews here have been extremely positive, but the negatives still bug me. Everyone has an opinion, but how anybody could find fault with this beautiful and soaring album is beyond me. Why do people like this even bother buying albums and listening to music in the first place when apparently all they want to do is find fault?? To me, \\"dull\\", \\"boring\\", \\"too mellow\\" and \\"mediocre\\" would better describe the first album \\"Parachutes\\"! Particularly irksome is the reviewer named \\"rehumanizer\\", who compares this to U2's latest, which he calls their worst album (and then ends his review stating that his critique is the \\"end of story\\" - yeah, one of THOSE people!) Some of U2's greatest songs are on \\"Atomic Bomb\\", and as for Coldplay, this is the logical extension to \\"Rush of Blood\\". Obviously, these are the same people who probably creamed themselves over the last three Radiohead albums which have about 50 good minutes of music between them. What did the harsh critics expect out of this album anyway? A miracle?? Well, unlike them, I received it!
B0009A1AS2|3.0|I've been a long time DT fan since Images & Words. I've heard every album, saw them live 2 times and I am disappointed with this album. This did not live up to my expectations. With each release, I've always thought DT out did the previous album and expected to be blown away by the new material. This time, the previous album out did the new material! <br />I've listened to the entire album about 6 times now and I find myself wanting to only hear about 4 songs repeatedly. Usually I can listen to the entire disc over & over again and never skip songs, but it's very hard not to do that here. <br />I thought they tried to cover too much diversity on this release. Trying to touch alot of different styles from previous records. The tracks sound like songs that didn't make: Awake, Six Degrees & Train of Thought, which are 3 totally different albums. I do appreciate their musical versatility to perform any style of music, but I would rather they focus on something that ties the entire album together (i.e. Metropolis II & TOT are perfect examples, which I feel are the best 2 albums they've ever done period!) Even Falling Into Infinty is a better album, as a whole, than this one.  <br /> <br />The brightest spots are: The Root of All Evil, These Walls, Panic Attack & Never Enough. These songs have the most in common and tie together well. The title track Octavarium, almost puts me to sleep. They tried to copy disc 2 from Six Degrees and it didn't work for me. The Answer Lies Within, I Walk Beside You & Sacred Sons are ok but way too relaxed and pop sounding. I think a lack of common ground keeps this from being a great album.  <br />James & Jordan are great on most of the tracks, but to me the band revolves around John P. & Mike. No big solos from Petrucci (aka As I Am) and nothing real exciting drum wise either. <br />If you're someone who loved Six Degrees, then you will probably enjoy this disc alot. However, if you're in the minority with those of us who loved Train of Thought, then you may want to reconsider. I'll give this an occasional listen from now on, but my DT time will be better spent on TOT, Metropolis II and Change of Seasons. No matter what I still admire DT for their abilities and musicianship and I'll wait patiently for the next release.
B00097A5HW|4.0|this cd is like a big walk-in closet where each song is an outfit shakira tries on momentarily. and, checking out her website, the polaroid picture theme suggests perhaps each song is supposed to be snapshot. a single mood, a single moment, a single particle of cinnamon floating in a tall glass of horchata.     the fact is that one should not buy this expecting a disc full of songs that sound like \\"la tortura\\". she released this as a single to lure in the masses, and once she has you in her realm, she forces you to experience many other facets of her personality/creativity. \\"la tortura\\" functions on this cd like the clever girl who beckons you to her bed, ties you up...and proceeds to show you her impressive art portfolio.     it's true that the cd lacks the easy flow of some of her previous work, such as \\"?donde estan los ladrones?\\". still, the trade-off is that we are able to experience the scope of her talent and that's a rewarding ride on the scenic route.     another thing about this cd is that there is more electronic sort of stuff present. shakira's strongest attribute (besides poetic lyrics, catchy melodies, and a palpable wisdom) is her vibrance; i felt that there were moments the production elements made her a little...soulless...or at least muted her glow. not so much that it ruins the cd, but it took a few listens to ease the discomfort.     anyway, here's a rough guide to some of the songs:     \\"en tus pipilas\\"--soft, sweet, and catchy. the french element gives it these quasi-stereolab moments i definitely wasn't expecting, but i liked them quite a bit.     \\"la pared\\"--i think this must be my favorite song on the disc. it's intense & infectious. the keyboards are used really effectively to convey the mood.     \\"la tortura\\"--it's a fun song, the beat speaks to the hips and the sassy lyrics tickle the mind. you've doubtless heard it already.     \\"obtener un si\\" is sort of sweet and innocent, like spanish bjork in a doris day movie. i think the right handscould remix this fabulously, transforming it into the sound of a sunrise stroll through some surrealistic flowery wonderland bursting with bubbles and populated by cartoon animals...but maybe that's just me...     \\"dia especial\\"--catchy and optomistic (in a sophisticated rather than a bubblegum way...like the sundays or 10,000 maniacs in their happier moments).     \\"escondite ingls\\"--ok, i'm not way into this song. it reminds me of tragic kingdom-era no doubt crossed with the b-52's \\"rock lobster\\". something about it just doesn't work for me, but you may feel differently.     \\"no\\"--the typical shakira slow song: a mellow, pretty slice of meloncholy.     \\"las de las intuicion\\"--this is the track where she goes electronic. i mostly like the song, i think i just object on principle to shakira sounding like kylie minogue. i also can't get over the goofy filtered backup vocals. if they could have left that out, it would been much better.     \\"dia de enero\\"--might have come off \\"pies descalzos\\"...has that sound and mood to me.     \\"la imprescindible\\"--i think the person who said depeche mode below was spot-on. except that where dm tends to have this sort of sardonic, aloof british delivery, shakira sounds a little too passionate for the cool electronic music. it took a little getting used to, but i like it now.     this disc may not be what you expect, may require a few listens, an open mind and the ability to be comfortable in the midst of seeming incongruity. but it's a good cd, and definitely superior to most pop on the market. it's fun to see shakira's range as an artist and that she continues to be committed to exploring new directions. it's obvious that she's determined to challenge herself...and her audience.
0449227545|3.0|The idea, at first blush, is bold and captivating. A fringe, cult-like group is determined to protect their commune, which is located in the backwoods of Northern California, from development. To do so, they need a credible means to force the state government to cease their incessant land-grabs. With the help of a geologist who's joined the commune, the cult leader (Priest) determines there may be a way to trigger earthquakes using a sonic mapping device known as a seismic vibrator.<br /><br />Follett's talent is prodigious. He's almost capable of making us believe that this preposterous scenario is remotely plausible. But even his immense talent isn't enough to make up for the succession of plot holes big enough to drive a seismic vibrator through.<br /><br />Example: At one point, Michael seems to be the only one in the state who hasn't seen Priest's picture on television. Because Michael encountered Priest early on in the story, he should have recognized him on TV and the entire FBI dragnet should have ended a lot sooner.<br /><br />The puzzle pieces are all there, in formulaic fashion: The cute, female FBI agent. The cute, divorced male geologist Michael. The Manson-like cult leader Priest who, though illiterate, is able to evade the FBI repeatedly while driving a giant seismic vibrator that tops out at about 40 mph. I'm sure you can guess what happens.<br /><br />If you're stuck inside on a rainy day and you happen to have this laying around (and nothing else to do), certainly go ahead and read it. Otherwise, learn macrame or origami. You'll drive yourself crazy second-guessing the characters and the author in this all-too-predictable bore-fest. Mr. Follett is far too talented to be producing works of this caliber.

B0006L16N8|4.0|I have not heard any negative reviews thus far for this most anticipated 3rd disc from a very talented band. The next U2? I heard the live tracks on VH1 and several studio tracks on XM radio and was thinking \\"not quite as polished as\\" \\"a rush of blood...\\" but since its release and a couple of spins.....dammmm this band does it again! Coldplay thrives on simple basics of pop musical artistry, well first of all they are delving to the pop stratusphere, anyways, they GEL as a band, their melodies flow in each song and from song to song with poetic lyrics and melodies that stick with the emotional part of people who appreciate melodic rock. This is not rock for Eminem or rappers, obviously, but for WE who appreciate music that just plain uses great vocals, lead/rhythm guitar, drums and awesome keys....Coldplay has the chemistry that few bands have to possibly be the next U2. Peace World...Coldplay rocks the soul !!!
B0009I7NNA|1.0|this is disgusting. its the worst cd i've ever bought. waking the fallen was amazing, the public should never have had to listen to this atrocity. without a doubt, the most dissapointing cd i've bought in the last few years. the vocals made me want to cry. if you mostly listen to heavier music than this (the red chord, into the moat, meshuggah), you are going to hate this with a passion. avenged was my guilty pleasure until this. i am ashamed to say that i used to like this band.
B00005JKMQ|2.0|Let me tell you that I know my bit about Cassius Clay and what he stood for. This movie has little or no entertainment value.Will Smith probably made a good Ali but to be true I thought he was boring and loud at all the wrong times.There's a fiest of bad actors in this movie and there's nothing really to talk about.I'm a Will Smith fan but this movie only made me a little confused with what I saw.It gets a bit too political somewhere in the middle and the final result of it is an overly preachy film.Watch it if you told yourself you had to do so.Don't buy it.Buy cheap bubble game but avoid buying at all costs or situations.<br /><br />P.S - I can't recall one scene I enjoyed in this film except the last fight scene(climax if you may call it that)
0784011176|5.0|I am a pianist  who spends most of his life playing or teaching the piano. A person who watches this movie without an understanding of the thoughts and emotions of a  musician will not ever comprehend the numerous layers of emotion that this movie presents. The Piano meant everything to this woman. Words could never describe this concept but she did say them with her playing. ( The playing is beautifully played by Holly Hunter) One man understands these feelings while another does not have a clue about what the piano means to the woman. The reviews that people have given regarding this movie clearly reflect the feelings that these two men had about the woman.  Some reviewers get it and some do not. If you are not a musician, you'll probably not appreciate this movie. If you are, you will buy this movie and watch it over and over again.  The woman used her piano to speak words that could never be expressed better in any other way. I understand that totally because my words will never describe how wonderful this movie is.  If you are a musician, go and buy this movie !
0783114222|4.0|Overall I enjoyed the set, one one small point that rubbed me the wrong way,there was next to nothing about the Mercury Program!! they spent maybe 20 min on it and them went to straight to the Gemini Program,nothing really about John Glenn orbiting the earth or Gus Grissom and the blown hatch they were mentioned as a afterthought ,never mind that without the Mercury 7 Program there would not be a Gemini or Apollo Programs.Just my 2 cents worth
B0009A1AS2|1.0|I can't believe people are actually wasting money on this dreck. <br />Why does this band still exist?
B000066HI4|5.0|On first listen I was disappointed with this album.  I expected melancholia but not like this.  After a few more spins I figured out what I had missed.  This is the most beautiful album.  Absolutely the best, it can be sad, it can be hopeful, it can be everything.  Will Oldham sounds real, and his reality is haunting and beautiful at the same time.  The music is minimalist and sparse which only contributes to the beauty and dynamic of the record.  It is one of the best albums of the 1990s and I recommend it to any true music fan.
B000001EAQ|5.0|On POP U2 have stripped away many of the obvious elements of guitar rock, creating music that is subtle and textured, yet still has the feeling of rock & roll.  <br /> <br />It's a thoroughly astonishing demonstration of musical virtuosity, and becomes even more impressive with repeated listens, which reveal subtleties like electronica rhythms, eerie keyboards, odd time signatures, and complex syncopations.  <br /> <br />This is their most complicated and difficult record, perhaps that the reason why so many people and \\"critics\\" didn't understand it. Its entirety means more than any one song. POP make the hairs on your skin spit with electricity. <br /> <br />POP is the album that established U2 as one of the most inventive and rewarding guitar-rock bands of the '90s. The astonishing emotional and compositional complexity of this piece of art will never be matched by any other U2 album. This is their last essential recording.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I picked this up the day it was released and have since only listened to the whole thing a few times but you can be assured I will listen to it many many times.  I can definitely say that there is alot to be appreciated here.  While it has a more pop sound, it is still pure DT.  Like the other reviewers said, this CD is comparable to the second disc of Six Degrees which is why I like it.  I am not a big fan of Train of Thought, it is probably the only DT album I will skip tracks on as it was way to harsh sounding, sonically mediocre and lacking in melody.  Overall based from what I have heard so far it is an excellent album so as long as you keep your mind open, as I think most DT fans are able to do since they cover so many styles.  If you love music and can appreciate all different kinds of it, you will love this album.  It is not as good as SFAM, which I think is their best work and one of the most brilliant pieces of music I've ever heard, but it is up there.  However it does contain small tidbits from other DT albums like SFAM did with Metropolis pt.1.  I think every song is great in its own sense, but I cannot say that it necessarily flows like SFAM although it follows a trend of being a very dark ablum, can be depressing as it deals with September 11th, panic attacks, mental illness and not living up to others expectations, yet it is, like most of DT's work, filled with emotion, variation, excellent musicianship (but no insane soloing) and melody.  Very tasteful and Highly recommended.
B000000OQF|5.0|Quite simply, this was THE hard rock album of the 1980s and one of, if not THE greatest hard rock album of all time.  Spot on writing in the lyrics and music, there isn't a bad track on this album and it shows the prowess of what could have been if GNR had stuck to this formula and not let artistic differences and success change the band that Guns N' Roses used to be.<br /><br />If you are between 20-30 years old I am sure that you already have this album in your collection if you like hard rock, so this review is more for the younger crowd that might not be familiar with Guns N' Roses.  So I say to that younger crowd, if you enjoy hard rock, stop reading this review and pick up 'Appetite For Destruction'.  There is no possible way you can be a hard rock fan and not give this blaring sonic orgasm a thumbs up.<br /><br />***** HIGHEST RECOMMENDATION
0393312836|4.0|Burgess' 'A Clockwork Orange' - thanks, for the most part, to Stanley Kubrick's screen adaptation - has become one of those classics that simply must be read at some point. Up there with '1984', 'The Catcher in the Rye' and 'Catch 22', its not-so-subtle jabs at authority seem to propell in into the arena of timeless college favourites. And this is not undeserved. Burgess has come up with an undeniably entertaining book that I would encourage all to read at some point, sooner rather than later. But, unfortunately, much of the criticism that has accompanied this book throughout its lifetime has been disproportionately positive. <br /> <br />That's not to say that there aren't many positives to praise. The story is told by our \\"humble narrator\\" Alex. The 15-17 year old speaks in an initially confusing mix of English/Slavic slang (or so I'm led to believe). While the common use of words like \\"viddy\\" (to see), \\"gulliver\\" (head) or \\"cancer\\" (cigarette) may seem challenging for the first few chapters, the style will grow on you quickly, and its quirky intelligence becomes a joy to read, somehow creating a refreshingly surreal atmosphere throughout the book. And the book does boast a decent plot, veiling (albeit lightly) an important philosophy: it is better to choose evil than to be forced to do good. Individual freedoms, and \\"all that cal\\". <br /> <br />But here is where the problem begins. The books major strengths combine, in a strange way, to leave some weaknesses. Burgess' informal and downright weird writing style do not make for the most convincing character development or philosophical power. I felt that the plot of the book would have been better served with a novel 2 or 3 times its length, in the style of a Dostoevsky or a Steinbeck. But, then again, that would mean losing its unique charm. The problem is that (and I will do my best to avoid any spoilers here, but be warned in any case) the major character development in the last chapter seems a bit hollow without any powerful/emotional scenes before it. There just doesn't seem to be a believable reason for what happens. And it's not as though there were no opportunities throughout the text to provide the basis for this revelation. The attempted suicide scene, the police beating - they were crying out for more serious undertones. Similarly, Burgess (as his American publishers did in the earlier days) could have left out the last chapter, leaving the novel relatively consistent. But that would have left its philosophy largely unproven. <br /> <br />All this leaves a slight aftertaste of an opportunity lost for an author who never seemed to reach his prime, and it is a shame. Burgess could have written 2 separate books, each of a different style instead of trying to amalgamate them into this effort, or he could have worked a little more on consitency. In any case, I feel something lacking in here. But, despite its flaws, 'A Clockwork Orange' is an immensely enjoyable - sometimes thrilling - read which holds, without question, a rare charm and intelligence. It should be read, if nothing else, for its ideas and its originality. Above all, it should be read - but don't get caught up in the hype. <br /> <br />Finally, for anyone it concerns, any scenes of violence or sex are a lot milder than I was expecting - so there's no real need to worry about that.
B00003CXA4|5.0|A beautiful tribute almost, to a man who lived according to his beliefs, fought for freedom (non-violently), and pursued peace between different religious groups. On screen his life becomes an epic that really paints him in a human way. The cinematography is beautiful. And the details surrounding certain events are done well. The film works on many levels, and it really inspires (which great bio-pics usually does).
B0006L16N8|5.0|After listening to Coldplay's \\"X&Y,\\" I'm convinced that they should now be the frontrunners for Album of the Year. This CD is simply magical by any standard. To even say that this is better than AROBTTH would be an understatement. Coldplay has earned their reputation times ten with this album. <br /> <br />FAVORITES: <br />Square One <br />What If <br />White Shadows <br />Talk <br />The Hardest Part <br />Twisted Logic <br />
B0007TKNI8|5.0|I have to say this movie is in fact, to this day, the best movie I have ever seen. The combination of actors/actresses with the drop dead gorgeous set, the fabulous music and every other aspect of this brilliant movie is just breath-taking. This is one of two movies that have made me shed a tear, the first being when I was eight and watching some cartoon. Emmy does a fantastic job at only sixteen years old. Patrick has a beautiful voice and is so dashing when he tries to save Christine, especially with a noose around his neck in the lair. Gerard, well, stole the show in my eyes. He adds a deeper emotion to the character of the Phantom. You can hear the desperation and assertiveness in his voice at all the right times. Gerard gives the Phantom a much needed edge to his voice that wasn't in Michael Crawford's phantom. Personally I prefer Gerard's version. Not to mention Gerard is also undeniably hot! They put together a fantastic cast with this movie. It is a must see! I absolutely loved it and watch it over and over!
B000002HRE|5.0|People these days aren't respecting Artist's right to a thing called Growth. <br /> <br />I personally like All of Metallica's Albums. Although this one I feel is more heavier than Load in some aspects. <br /> <br />Now onto the review.  <br /> <br />1. Fuel <br />  - This song starts the album off, good song. Not the best, song on the album.  <br /> <br />2. The Memory Remains <br />  - Again good song, not the best on the album.  <br /> <br />3. Devil's Dance <br />  - This is my personal favourite track on this album. Heavy.  <br /> <br />4. The Unforgiven II <br />  - Personally, although this one is heavier than the Unforgiven I. I tend to prefer Unforgiven I.  <br /> <br />5. Better Than You <br />  - Good, but does get a bit repetitive. The vocals in this song are great. Heavy-ish. <br /> <br />6. Slither <br />  - Abstract song, great. Nice beat to it. One of the best. <br /> <br />7. Capre Diem Baby <br />  - Starts off strong in my opinion, nice vocals and lyrics in this song. Definitely another best of the album. <br /> <br />8. Bad Seed <br />  - Another abstract song. \\"Chokin' on a Bad seed\\". Great. Nice beat and overall feel to the song.  <br /> <br />9. Where the Wild Things Are <br />  - Another great song for the album. In my opinion, could be a ballad. The Ballad for Reload. Great song, starts off nice. Doesn't get boring. \\"Toy horses start the charge, robots, chess men standing guard\\". Great Song! <br /> <br />10. Prince Charming <br />  - Well this is definitely different to the last song and doesn't fit in to the end of \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\", but still a good song. Good beat. Fast. <br /> <br />11. Low Man's Lyric <br />  - One of Metallica's slow but great songs. This was my favourite song on Reload for a very long time. Now this is a ballad.  <br /> <br />12. Attitude <br />  - Doesn't fit in to Low Man, but picks up the pace. Great Song. Although it tends to annoy me sometimes. \\"Suppose I say I'm Never Satisfied?\\" <br /> <br />13. Fixxxer <br />  - This song definitely ends the album on a good note. Overall Good song. I can never get sick of this song. <br /> <br /> <br />Overall the songs to look out for are: Fixxxer, Low Man's Lyric, Where the Wild Things Are, Slither and Devil's Dance. <br /> <br />One to be cautious of: Fuel... I don't know why, I just got sick of it too fast. <br /> <br />This album may take a while, but it will get stuck to you. Meanwhile, I'm off to start a playlist on my ipod with the best from Load and Reload and call it Reloaded.  <br /> <br />Go 'tallica!!!!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|What a great series this is... as stated in so many reviews before me... this series, now only available on DVD is one of the most original, well written, most thought out, attention to detail having shows I have seen on mainstream television in a long time.<br /><br />I was not a huge fan of either Buffy or Angel either, and not to say that I didnt't enjoy them when I caught them being aired: only to say I was not a fan of religiously watching every week. (I enjoyed maybe 4 epsiodes total of each.)<br /><br />FIREFLY, I never saw at all when it WAS being aired on t.v. Agian I say, this is an amazingling well created series. The detail, and originality of this show caught me off gaurd. Without employing so many of the sci-fi cliches... this show accomplishes a level of greatness. It brings a fresh look to the sci-fi genre infusing the ideas of a frontier style attiude. I am aware that sci-fi and 'western' storylines have been fused together in previous attempts, this is the most seamless version of the idea, that I have seen.<br /><br />I am a science fiction genre fan, and this is a welcome, and valuable addition to my collection. Get your copy now!<br /><br />As many know by now there will be a feature length film released soon, and as one contributor to the series said... we can only hope that someone will go...\\"why haven't we made a t.v. show out of this, and then SERENITY will be resurrected. LET'S HOPE! EVERYONE FOCUS ON THAT FOR A SECOND..READY..... NOW!
B000002HMH|5.0|1. Ain't My Bitch <br />  - My first impression great, now two years later. This song tends to get tedious. Still not to bad though. Listen in moderation. <br /> <br />2. 2 X 4  <br />  - At one stage, I loved this song, then I hated it... I don't know why. Now listening to it two years later. It's good. <br />  <br />3. The House Jack Built <br />  - One of my favourite songs back in the day. Still appealing. The sound is great. \\"Let the show begin\\" ... Yes, buckle your seatbelt. Your in for a treat. <br /> <br />4. Until It Sleeps <br />  - One of the best songs on this album. Slow then picks up during Chorus. James did a great job of the lyrics. Still one my favourite songs by Metallica, the music video is great. <br /> <br />5. King Nothing <br />  - This song, is good. Personally one of my least favourites on this album though. <br />  <br />6. Hero of the Day <br />  -  Great song. I can't really say much on it though.  <br /> <br />7. Bleeding Me <br />  - One of the best songs on this album. I cannot get sick of this song. <br /> <br />8. Cure <br />  - Another great song, this too I cannot get sick of. Worth listening to. <br />  <br />9. Poor Twisted Me <br />  - \\"Oh Poor Twisted Me\\" - Great. This song is also one of the best.... Ahh.. Can't think of anything bad with it.  <br />  <br />10. Wasting My Hate <br />  - hehe. Nice fastish paced song. Could do with a bit of polishing on lyrics. other wise great.  <br />  <br />11. Mama Said <br />  - One of Metallica's nice slow songs -- good for chilling out. <br /> <br />12. Thorn Within <br />  - This is right behind Bleeding Me for top spot. A flippin great song. <br /> <br />13. Ronnie <br />  - Great song about a disturbed kid. This was my favourite when i heard this album for the first time. <br /> <br />14. Outlaw Torn <br />  - This song ends the album on a very flipping good note. I love this song and it doesn't get boring. Heavy.  <br /> <br /> <br />Songs to look out for: All <br />Songs to not listen to, too much: Ain't My Bitch, 2x4, King Nothing. <br /> <br />Overall a great album. Suggest it to anyone and everyone. I don't see what these people are having against Metallica's growth and by the way. St Anger is great. :D <br />
B0007TKNL0|3.0|I viewed this film for the first time last night, and was both impressed and disappointed, in that order.   <br /> <br />Impressed, that the director and designers were able to capture the lavish look and feel of the stage production and use their medium to add their own embellishments (the transformation of the opera house was especially evocative.)  Impressed, that lyrically, the film kept mostly to the orginal libretto, with only minor alterations (spoken lines instead of sung, and the regretable lyrical changes that have evolved over the years.)  However, this is where the disappointment sets in.   <br /> <br />Most of the acting is incredibly stiff, unemotional, and downright dull, with the notable exception of Minnie Driver who, as the prima-donna, Carlotta, is able to convincingly portray the actress as over-the-top in life as on stage.  It is also worth noting that Carlotta's singing voice (the only one dubbed in) is also the only one truly up to the challenge of this operetta.  Musically, only the phantom's voice seems able to carry the passion and presence of the music, and that only for about half the movie.  Christine, whose voice is exceptionally pure and lovely, does not seem to have the strength or training that is required to truly carry the role.  Her voice is often stretched, thin, and strident, and she sings without passion or expression.  Speaking of expressionless performances, the actor portraying Raoul takes his performance to new depths of mediocrity.  His voice is as wooden as his emotions, and I found myself secretly rooting for his demise; hey, the filmmakers took a few liberties, why not add one more?   <br /> <br />In terms of major changes, the phantom's backstory, changed both from the novel and the stage play, added very little to our understanding of the character or his motivations, and only succeeded in causing those audience members in the know to roll their eyes and sigh heavily.  The most glaring oversight by far,however, was the missing chandelier crash at the end of act one, forcing yet more banal lyrical changes in act two, and lessening the impact of the chandalier's eventual fall by making it look like an accident and not a cunning act by the phantom. <br /> <br />Overall, the movie presents a visually stunning, lyrically faithful adaptation of Webber's stage production, but fails to capture the power and passion of the stage production.  I recommend it to those who have never seen the stage production, or who love the story so much, that they are willing to overlook the film's flaws.
0316172324|4.0|I devoured this book, it's an interesting, quick and fun read. Initially I was convinced the author had conveyed some brilliant insights, and my life was changed. A few days later, though, I kind of think that his insights are interesting, yes, and thought-provoking. But not really much more than common sense would lead any intelligent person to conclude.  <br /> <br />Still, I do recommend it as an interesting book.
B00004TH7Z|2.0|So you say this is a classic Iron Maiden... It doesn't do much for me, no matter how much I love Iron Maiden. Why?... The songs are too slow, too long, too repetitive and over-produced. The only tracks I like here are \\"The Wickerman\\", \\"Ghost Of The Navigator\\" and \\"Out Of The Silent Planet\\". <br />Lets face it... The only reason this album is so popular is because of the return of Adrian Smith & Bruce Dickinson. If they still had Blaze Bailey on vocals this would have been yet another flop. Those Smith/Dickinson arselickers make me sick.
B00070Q7VO|5.0|OK, I admit it.  I did it.  Something I rarely do.  Buy a CD for one song, not worried what else I will find.  But I did it here.  I saw Michael Bubl perform \\"Feeling Good\\" on TV and thought he really did the song justice.  So, I *had* to have it.  Some remakes by contemporary artists leave me begging for the original, but if this song was going to be covered, this is how I wanted to hear it.  I love the way this song is produced.    There were other pleasant surprises.  A fresh cover of \\"You Don't Know Me\\" (but I do also like the Ottmar Liebert instrumental version in \\"Groundhog Day\\" and, of course, LOVE the Ray Charles version, which is still the best IMHO).  While I'm also a big early Beatle's fan, I like the chance Michael took on the \\"Can't Buy Me Love\\" track.  I've never been a big Nelly Furtado fan but she was destined to sing \\"Quando, Quando, Quando\\" with Michael.  Just excellent on both of their parts.  Nelly's voice really shines on this track.    This is one of those CD's that you put on during a rainy Saturday afternoon, kick back on the couch and just let it roll.  Good job, Michael.
B000063DI8|5.0|I love it. It was a time of major changes for Iron Maiden: First change in lineup since \\"Piece Of Mind\\", and with new guitarist Janick Guers they went back to a more raw sound... It's sounds almost like their first album. Also at that point, Bruce Dickinson gave up all the high pitch wailing that makes a lot of people hate Maiden, and he went for deeper, angrier vocals. He finally reveals his sense of humour with those \\"Hee!Hees!\\".  After all those extremely successful albums, all they could do was decline, but \\"No Prayer For The Dying\\" includes their ONLY #1 HIT SINGLE \\"Bring Your Daughter... To The Slaughter\\". Come On... Isn't that a great song?  Once again, the people who hate this album are the music fascists who can't accept changes and would have liked another classic album with Adrian Smith on guitar... GET A LIFE!    P.S.: That new cover is rubbish. The man being strangled has been wiped away. Now Eddie isn't strangling anything. He looks like a pathetic zombie.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This is a very original record. The guitars have much improved from Waking The Fallen. I'll try to describe the songs. <br /> <br />Beast And The Harlot- 80's metal sounding. Great guitars, but I think the chorus is weak. 3/5 <br /> <br />Burn It Down- This is a good song. I love the sound of the voice, and the guitar. Good solo. 4/5 <br /> <br />Blinded In Chains- This song gives me goosebumps. Cool vocals, amazing guitar work, and an incredible bass solo. 5/5 <br /> <br />Bat Country- Very catchy chorus. Great solo, and drumming. 4/5 <br /> <br />Trashed And Scattered- A decent song. Im not too fond of the vocals, but great guitar work. 3/5 <br /> <br />Seize The Day- The slowest song. Very GNR sounding, and great vocals. 5/5 <br /> <br />Sidewinder- Western sounding. Incredible guitars, great vocals. 5/5 <br /> <br />The Wicked End- One of my least favorites. But, great bass intro, and great solo. 3/5 <br /> <br />Strength Of The World- Very epic sounding. A cool western intro, with orchestra. Great vocals. 4/5 <br /> <br />Betrayed- A very powerful song. Dedicated to Dimebag Darrell. Nice guitarwork and drums. 4/5 <br /> <br />MIA- Great song. Love everything about this song. 5/5
B00080ZG10|4.0|DiCaprio masterfully portrays Hughes as a genius, eccentric visionary and psychotic. His \\"battle\\" with Alda was superb. His successful test flights are captivating. Blanchett gives a strong performance. If the movie had been more tightly edited, it would have deserved 5 stars. Well worth seeing.
B0006L16N8|4.0|It was bound to happen really:  a CD this hyped up had to come back down to ground level upon release.  And with that, you often get disappointment because nothing can stand up to the expectations and hype X&Y had.  In a way I feel bad for Coldplay.  If they don't experiment with their music, critics say that they are boring and untalented.  If they do switch up their style a bit, another set of critics say that they are not being authentic and are disappointing their fans.  Either way, they can't win. <br /> <br />I have only listened to X&Y twice, but I see nothing intrinsically wrong with it.  On one hand, they are still the recognizable Coldplay we all know.  Chris Martin still sounds like himself, and the rest of the band still play their normal instruments.  But on the other hand, they have introduced a slightly heavier, more techno sound on some of their songs.  On the whole though, all of the songs are quite similar, which makes it a very continuous, fluid CD that is easy to listen to.  <br /> <br />Reviews are often good for helping someone to decide if they might like a product.  But upon seeing the conflicting reviews this album has received, I think anyone who likes Coldplay should just bite the bullet and check out X&Y.  Only then can you truly decide whether you like it or not.   <br /> <br />Anticommercialism seems to be the cool trend now, with just about everyone proclaiming that they have eclectic music tastes.  I praise Coldplay for continuing to play what they enjoy, even if it is mainstream and boring to some people.  They play what they like and what their fans seem to enjoy, and there is nothing wrong with that.
B0007Y08IS|1.0|I don't even know how to begin to explain how bad this movie is. The fact that it has gotten four stars from the people of amazon blows my mind. The movie is so boring and so dull, that it is beyond belief. There was maybe one or two parts to the movie that made me laugh. But those two parts do not make up for all the time I wasted watching these peice of garbage. I am a huge fan of southpark and had high hopes for this movie. But I would go as far to make the bold statement that it is worse than Baseketball. Yes that is correct worse than Baseketball and I did not believe that was possible. Not even the sex scenes with the puppets could save this movie. It is so boring, so uninteresting, and just overall weak. I can not believe I bought this film and it taints my dvd rack to this day.
1579124585|5.0|Of course this book has been a classic for more than 25 years. Now the newest edition, with loads of images and documentary material, makes another copy in my library a great purchase.<br /><br />When you read in his story about how the astronauts were Luce's boys, you get to see the \\"Life\\" magazine covers and spreads.  When you read about the hangouts for Drinking & Driving for the jet jockeys, you can see them here.  The illustrations make this edition a wonderful record of American pop culture and iconography.  Buy it again, and enjoy turning the pages.
0778320448|2.0|My mother loved this book and sent it to me along with \\"A Good Yarn\\", as we also are knitters.  However, I felt that the author did not delve deeply below the surface of each of the 4 characters.  Each chapter was repetitive and predictable.  Carol's character in particular was tiresome, but a good cook, although probably not as good a cook as Jacqueline's daugher in law!  Chapter after chapter droned on while I waited for the plot to move forward.  I enjoyed the Seattle setting but wished that there was more substance to this tale.  It is a sweet story and a quick read with many repetitive chapters.  Ms. Macomber could have \\"ripped out\\" a few chapters or gave each character greater depth.  And now I have to read A Good Yarn.
B00097A5I6|4.0|Oasis was on top of the rock world for a while.  Then things got bad for Oasis and after a string of albums that couldn't possibly live up to the expectations that had gotton so high after Whats the story. <br />The guys from Oasis seem to be getting it back now.  Don't Believe the Truth is an album that has about zero hype in America.  I havn't heard their single 'Lyla' once on the radio.  Oasis deserves so much credit for making this album very well after a seris of flops.  My favorite songs were 'Let There Be Love' because it is a buetiffly written song, and 'The Importance of Being idle.' <br />This album is a great comeback album for Oasis and should be listened to by all. <br /> <br />
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|I was WOWed by this album. It feels familiar, but also fresh and experimental. Sort of What Led Zep Could Have Been Today. I never cared too much for Plant's vocals when he hit the high registers, but in the acoustic songs he has a sweetness and an intimacy that have almost no equals. And, since his vocals have matured a lot, along with this ex-rock god, now a sensitive, intelligent and open 56 year old, this CD is thoroughly enjoyable. The best he has given us since \\"Ship of Fools\\".
B0006L16N8|4.0|I don't know why people are sayin that this album is a let down. Yeah A Rush Of Blood To the Head was incredible but you can't use that as a measurement of this album's greatness otherwise coldplay would always be a dissappointment. Once you've created a masterpiece its pretty hard to top it. Look at Orson Welles and Citizen Kane, he was destined for failure after making such a great movie.  <br /> <br />This album should not be compared to other albums it should just be enjoyed for what it is, GOOD MUSIC, no more, no less. <br /> <br />Bottom Line X&Y is not a dissappointment, in fact it is a very good album and all Coldplay fans should get it.
0792839730|5.0|All I can say is: my jaw dropped of watching this movie. I was in real war you know, and this movie made me feel that I was in a real war again! this is not only an action but a real epic movie. perhaps the only movie I can call it epic. every single scene of it was true and the details were unbeleavably right! and maybe funny to mention, there is no additional love scenes or heros to fool women and encourage them to watch it! well, this is my opinion cause it makes me feel the smell of my best days again! <br />at the other hand, at an oridinary costumer's point ot view, this movie could probably be boring, or making no sense. Specially if you're not single, it would be hard to watch such movie cause women hate such movies! <br />There is something I have to say about this DVD. I don't know if there are two releases of this movie on DVD, cause I've not bought it from amazon.com, but if there is only one release, the product information on this site is crude. let me make it complete, Special features of this DVD (or my DVD) consist of : <br /> <br />1. An audio commentary <br />2. Documentaries & Featurettes <br />3. Photo gallery <br />4. Theatrical trailer
B0006L16N8|5.0|Like others I prefer not to say much.Not only the best Coldplay's album but most probably the album of the year.Just perfect 100% Coldplay.
B000051Y0G|5.0|I thought Cyndi would be the one, back in the early 80's among that great female rocker collection of Madonna, the Bangles, the Go-Go's and the already established Chrissie Hynde.  Side one of this album did nothing to change that opinion; side two was a bit of a let down, although only by comparison with what went before.  But oh that first side --  From Money Changes Everything to She Bop, Cyndi holds nothing back, bringing the kind of joy, freshness, exuberance, spite and desperation that rock at its rare best always unleashes on the world.  She never matched it -- would it even have been possible? -- but what a thrill it was, and continues to be today with every hearing.
B0006L16N8|5.0|If you look at my location, you'll see that I'm from britain; home of the legendary Coldplay as well as many other great modern rock and indie bands. It's great to see the British muzak scene is finally making up for years of crappy muzak by crappy bands. These \\"bands\\" I'm referring to are those posers such as Queen, Pink Floyd, Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden and all of those \\"progressive\\" lozers like Yes, Genesis, Van der graaf generator, King Crimson and that Peter Gabriel poser. These guys were bad. I know they are bad because I've never heard of half of them. These guys think they're top stuff just because they like to create something new with each \\"album\\", when what they don't realise is that nobody wants to see some gay boy (I refer to all the musicians I don't like as homosexuals) noodle around with a bunch of instruments for an hour or two. What they want is real muzak, which is what Coldplay makes. Britain has produced a lot of crappy guitar players (Holdsworth, Mclaughin, Fripp, May, that dead poser from Led Zeppelin, etc), but thankfully this guy from Coldplay makes up for that. You should get this if you want good muzak.  <br /> <br />Also I'd just like to point out that Chris Martin is a better pianist than Vitalij Kuprij, based solely on the fact that he has a hot wife.
B00000ING2|4.0|Both the Hudsucker Proxy and the Big Lebowski took a while for me to warm up to, but the more often I see them the more I enjoy them.  They are both gutsy experiments in film with Lebowski being a hard-nosed detective story mixed with the least competent (or at least someone who you would assume to be the least competent) detective working on the case.  The \\"Hud\\" is a nod to the old Capra films and the Coen brothers obviously love playing with different styles of film to follow the conventions while making their own spins on the genres.  The Coens are the only director/writers/producers who seem to be able to do this consistently without becoming annoying or overly self-referential.  The Horatio Algiers-ish story of the hardworking rube coming to the big city to make his fortune and succeeding against all odds is funny and engaging.  The actors, design, dialoge, mood (especially the washed out lighting used throughout the movie), are all meticulously put together to make a fantastically entertaining movie.  Tim Robbins, Jennifer Jason Leigh and John Mahoney turn in fantastic performances and what can you say about Paul Newman?  The guy steps into his role flawlessly and delivers crisp and menacing dailog beautifully.<br /><br />Peter Ward
0385510454|2.0|If you want to learn Italian or you want a guided tour of northern Italy read this book. Otherwise skip it.
B0007Y08PQ|4.0|Before \\"Nemesis\\" came around, \\"Insurrection\\" was the film highly debated and spoken about. Was it good? Bad? What went wrong, what did they do right? I think critics, and some reviewers, are a little harsh when it comes to this film. I'll say that it's a light-hearted film. It followed \\"First Contact,\\" which featured the Borg and humanity itself being on the line. \\"Insurrection\\" is, in my opinion, original in that it deals with new enemies, new aliens, and has Picard actually seeing the darker side of the Federation.<br /><br />I say that this release redeems the film in that it fleshes it out more. There's lots of commentary on the production of the film, on it's development, on what went wrong and right. Those responsible for the script speak candidly about the changes in the script and \\"what could have been\\" while ending on \\"this is what happened.\\" What I liked was that Frakes and Michael Piller don't pretend to like the script. They don't dress-up their commentary or act as if the film was perfect. They explain a lot and I came out of it actually liking the film even more.<br /><br />The film does have over 2 hours of special features. No audio commentary feature like the origianl DVD release, but I didn't miss it because I felt it was made-up for in the bonus features.<br /><br />In the production section, there are featurettes such as \\"It Takes a Village,\\" \\"Location, Location, Location,\\" and \\"The Making of Star Trek Insurrection\\" which has commentary from Frakes, Stewart, McFadden and Sirtis, as well as Donna Murphey and F. Murray Abraham about all the thoguht that went into the creation of the Ba'ku and the change of scenery from the usual starship/space backdrop to an actual planet-side story. Stewart had a lot to do with how the film came out, so he does nothing but gush about how great it is. I actually enjoyed hearing from the members of the cast who usually have smaller roles. This is a film that actually gives a lot of attention and time to the supporting cast. I also found \\"Director's Notebook\\" to be a great explanation for the film. Frakes comes out and says that the script wasn't as great as \\"First Contact\\" but explains in depth how he and the others tried to work it. There's even a part of the interview when Frakes is unable to talk because he's just laughing histerically. Perhaps that doesn't help the film, but it definately was interesting to hear all that he had to say, or laugh about. \\"The Story\\" features Michael Piller's side of the story and how the film was developed.<br /><br />I found the \\"Creation the Illusion\\" section to be the weakest. They explain how the shuttle chase at the start of the film, the duck blind, and the drone scene were developed. Really, I found these to be dragging and rather dull. They could have explained the Briar Patch construction or the big battle scene between the Enterprise and the Son'a vessels. Instead, it goes for some smaller scenes that didn't need much explaination. I did enjoy all the jokes being dished about Spiner and the Data underwater scene.<br /><br />\\"The Star Trek Universe\\" section contains one feature on Westmore's Aliens and one on the alien women of Star Trek. I actually enjoyed both. I liked hearing how Westmore created not just the aliens for this film but how he's designed and developed them over the years. This contains footage and commentary on all of Trek, not just The Next Generation or this film. The \\"Star Trek's Beautiful Women\\" was a nice segment as well. Perhaps a tad bit sexist, because we certainly don't have entire segments devoted to Star Trek's men, but it was still entertaining. It too contained footage from all the shows and films. Even Robert Picardo (Voyager), Connor Trineer (Enterprise), Chase Masterson (Deep Space Nine), and the actress who portrayed Jadzia Dax on Deep Space Nine took part in interviews for this segment. I found Marina Sirits, as usual, to be hilarious and her commentary quite interesting, putting it mildly.<br /><br/>There are also a lot of deleted scenes included. The film on these is rather low at times and hard on the eye, but all of the deleted scenes were fun to watch. I enjoyed the extended Troi/Riker flirting in the library scene as well as the alternate ending. I wish the cut Quark appearance could have been included, but the many deleted scenes also made this release worth buying it.<br /><br />As for the transfer quality, I thought it was okay. Some have been complaining that it's distracting at times because it's so high quality, but I didn't think so. Sound was great.<br /><br />\\"Insurrection\\" is not the best film but it's not the worst either. I saw it as a big episode, and perhaps that's where the movie is flawed. I do think the humor at times made it weak and wonder how they could have turned the film into a sci-fi comedy, or how Picard could turn into another Kirk and fall in love with a woman within 24 hours and yet show no feelings at all towards Beverly Crusher ... when Riker and Troi's romance was rekindled by being around this planet ... but all that aside, it's a decent film and a great DVD release chocked full of bonus features to please any fan. There are also three easter eggs, two including Marina Sirtis. She and Dorn have a hilarious hidden feature where she asks \\"what is this film about?\\" and he tries to explain it. Definately worth your money and attention.y. <br /> <br />There are also a lot of deleted scenes included.

B0006L16N8|5.0|And when I say typical...I mean 5 stars everytime. People expect change and adaptation in every album a musician creates. But Coldplay has found a formula, that truly appeals to those that appreciate them, and they (AND US) accept that. This album is probably no album to \\"convert\\" someone to Coldplay, but completely satisfies an individual who has come to love them over the years. If your an \\"album\\" sort of person, you can really respect this album...but if your a live show person, you will come to love what Coldplay brings to the table. I couldn't come to say what the best tracks on the album are, because all of them appeal to me at some point. If your an uplifting sort of person id say: Talk, Square One, The Message, and Speed of Sound. If your in intellectual who wishes to think about the songs more than others id say: Till Kingdom Come, Shawallowed by the Sea, and The Hardest Part will likely appeal to you. All in all, this is a solid album, that shows that creativeness and musicianship are not dead, but hopefully just starting. Let us appreciate some quality music (not just one good song on an album, unlike most artists) and thank Coldplay for their love of music and life which they inspire.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Firstly I think this is a really good album. I have never heard any Dream Theater I don't like. Yet I don't think this is their best album. It is quite generic. The title track Octavarium is a triumph of music, enthralling and moving, yet even on this track there are many different influences being take heavily, Pink Floyd, Genesis and Yes seem to feature heavily. I do think that Sacrificed Sons is also very, very good. But the rest is a bit to generic for it to be great I feel. I am not a fan of Muse and to find DT doing that style was a shock. They do the style well but I do not think it is what THEY do best. I think that although good this album does not measure up to the likes of Scenes of a Memory, Images and Words or, in my opinion, Six Degrees (second CD). This is worth a listen to and I look forward to seeing them live.
B000002JKA|5.0|There are not enough synonyms in the English language for the word \\"great\\" to adequately describe how awesome this CD really is.  This might very well be THE best album of all time.  It's certainly progressive, it's for sure metal, and it's most defiantly the most awesome thing to ever grace my ears.  I can't say it's without a doubt the best Dream Theater album, but it's one of their most musically diverse, accessible, and replay-able. <br /> <br />6:00 and Erotomania are showcases for Dream Theater's superior musicianship.  Caught In A Web, Voices, Lie, and the Mirror give the album its heavier, edgier fell, while Innocence Faded, The Silent Man, Lifting Shadows Off A Dream, and Space-Dye Vest provide the emotional and beautiful side.  My two favorites, though, are Innocence Faded (too darn short, but I love the pre-chorus) and Scarred (gets the nod as my favorite song on the album).  Every song is great--there's no low point in the album. <br /> <br />The production of the album is flawless (only complaint is I could use a slightly louder, \\"boom\\"ier bass drum)--every crisp hi-hat from Portnoy hit and every blazing note from Petrucci come out perfectly audible.  Dream Theater will always be the musician's music, but I think this, like Images and Words, extends beyond its progressive base.  It's probably their darkest album, though not their most influential, heaviest, or technical.  Still, I think it's overall their best, if not solely for its replay value.  The beauty is in the subtleties!  The guitar in the background of Scarred's chorus, the flawlessly incorporated keyboard, and Portnoy's beautiful double-bass drum work all contribute to this album's staying power.  I can't really do justice to how good this album is, you'll just have to get it yourself.  I'll have this one spinning in the CD player for many years to come. <br /> <br />Final verdict: 5 stars+ <br />Instant classic, must have, essential.  Get the point?
B000059MEK|5.0|This is one of my favorite CDs.  It's original, upbeat, kind of house, kind of mainstream.  What can I say, if you like Dance, and House, you'll definitely like this CD.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|Those of you hoping for WTF II are obviously going to be  disappointed with this album. After the musical bliss that is WTF, I had very high expectations for this album.  Obviously, they could have stuck to what they were doing, and no one would complain, but, whether the disappearance of the screaming is due to M. Shadow's vocal surgery, Warner bros., or them wanting to go in a new direction, or a combination of all three, who knows, but at times I find myself sorely missing the screaming that added another level of vocal variety to the mix. Also I find myself missing the dark, atmospheric guitar riffs, that seemed to engul you into the music, replaced with blistering leads and solos more reminiscient of 80's heavy metal. Not to say this album isn't good, in fact, it is very good, just different and not what I was expecting. Nevertheless, they do succeed with their new sound, as I believe any band with thier talent could succeed at any style of music they want to play, especially with axemen like Zacky and Synyster. While it is refreshing to hear something different and creative,I would still like to see another WTF type album before all is said and done. I think they may lose some of the metalcore fans, labeling them as \\"sell-outs,\\" with this alubm, but i think they will gain more hard rock and metal fans then they will lose overall, and for the record, I think this album was in no way an attempt to \\"sell-out.\\" All in all, not A7X's best, but still better than 95% of what's out there.
0399236201|5.0|This fast paced story will keep you up all night, because it definitely kept me up all night. Alex Rider is just your normal teen, but when his Uncle dies he finds that his Uncle was a MI6 spy. The plot is full of interesting people and the plot is perfect, everything has its place in the story. Nothing is overlooked and all of the characters are people that you will hate or love. This is a great series; I can't wait to read the next one.
B0000062GE|1.0|I picked this album up as a total experiment when I saw it in a charity shop for two pounds. It was produced by Dave Jerden who did a great job with Janes Addiction and Alice in chains- so seemed like a safe bet. <br />The last track is great and worth my 2 quid (starts off Tubeway Army then riffs nicely) but the rest is pseudo depression music for middle class children who have no real problem beyond not being allowed to get their tongue pierced. Its like music for school kids written by the teachers. <br /> <br />Everything about this album is contrived. I cannot hear any self expression, art or even meaning in any of these woefully cheesy pop songs. The most annoying thing about this record is that it tries so painfully hard to be deep, heavy and modern and it is none of these things. <br />  <br />File under mild cheese.
044024157X|1.0|I was thoroughly disappointed. Although Grisham does a reasonably good job in setting the historical scene in bigot-ridden Mississippi, the long passages detailing mundane characters and trivial parathemes are mostly superfluous. When the story finally enters second gear around page 420 (of approx. 480) it is too late, and the reader is longing for an ending, no matter how it arrives. Even then, the build up to the finale is jerky and completely lacks suspense. Grisham must be one of the most over-rated writers of fiction today.
B00025ETIW|4.0|Before I saw MCR on March 30th on The Taste of Chaos I didn't really like them. In fact, I thought they were a little annoying. But after I saw them in concert I was just blown away with how awesome they were in concert. They played some of the songs on this album and I loved them. Thats what drove me to get this album. And its been in my cd player since April. I love it. :)
B0006L16N8|3.0|Compared to their last album, X&Y is actually rather lame.  The music isn't as adventurous and the the lyrics seem to be trying too hard.  I was a very big fan of Rush of Blood.. but this album  sounds like a mediocre band trying to sound like the Coldplay of 2003.  There will be die-hard fans out there that will defend this to the end but they are too close to be subjective.  If you are not a huge Coldplay fan, I would recommend maybe buying only a couple songs from ITunes instead of wasting it on the whole album.
B0006L16N8|3.0|Enjoy this album while you still can.<br /><br />Coldplay have put together another great album of catchy, anthemic, radio-friendly songs, the kind of songs you can't help but bob your head to the first time you hear them. Back in the 60s, that might have meant you'd found an album you could enjoy for life, something so timeless it would never get old. But in this age of instant media super-saturation, these songs will hit like an atomic bomb and lay waste to everything in sight. They'll be used to sell everything from cars to pants to vacations. They'll appear on Top 40 radio and network TV. You won't be able to walk five paces without catching a Coldplay song, and as a result, they'll be burnt to a crisp in a matter of months.<br /><br />So buy this and enjoy it while you can, because it's a soaring, grandiose, reasonably well-executed album, and because you're going to hear it anyway, no matter where you go. I hesitate to call it a fun album, because fun implies a certain amount of lightness and frivolity, and this band doesn't do anothing light or frivolous. No, everything they do is big and epic; they write soaring songs about love and horizons and space and what-not.<br /><br />If Coldplay aren't the next U2, they're certainly pretty darn close. (I know it's trite to compare Coldplay and U2, but I'm going to do it anyway.) At his best, Chris Martin's a better singer than Bono, which is saying a lot, but at his worst, he's a worse lyricist, which is also saying a lot. And Jonny Buckland's guitar has that soaring, arcing, Edge-like quality to it, spare and simple and catchy, without frills or pyrotechnics. In many ways this is the album that \\"How to Disassemble an Atomic Bomb\\" wanted to be--a CD full of crowd-pleasers, nothing we haven't heard before, but nothing that'll make us press the Skip button, either.<br /><br />It'd be nice if they experimented a little, if they expanded the boundaries of what was possible rather than just coloring by the numbers. \\"Every step that you take could be your biggest mistake,\\" Chris Martin sings on \\"What If,\\" and it sounds like an admonishment he's been giving to the band to keep them in line. \\"Just keep doing what you're doing,\\" you can imagine him telling the band. \\"Keep doing what you're doing and, before you know it, you, too, will be fathering children with beautiful actresses and fighting off hordes of paparrazzi.\\" Still, they'll be around for a while, so there'll be plenty of time for adventurism further down the road. For now, they're content to nail down their fan base and achieve worldwide dominance; hopefully in another few years they'll put together their \\"Achtung Baby.\\" On \\"Square One,\\" Chris Martin sings \\"You just want somebody listening to what you say.\\" Don't worry, Chris--we'll still be listening.ur biggest mistake,\\" Chris Martin sings on \\"What If,\\" and it sounds like an admonishment he's been giving to the band to keep them in line. \\"Just keep doing what you're doing,\\" you can imagine him telling the band. \\"Keep doing what you're doing and, before you know it, you, too, will be fathering children with beautiful actresses and fighting off hordes of paparrazzi.\\" Still, they'll be around for a while, so there'll be plenty of time for adventurism further down the road.

B0006L16N8|4.0|Right now I don't think this album is as good as their previous one, but maybe it will grow on me.  \\"Fix You\\" and \\"White Shadows\\" are definitely my favorite songs.  Most of the other songs you have to be in a mood for, and some towards the end I doubt will grow on me, like some of the songs on their previous albums.  Then again, as both they and Radiohead have shown, sometimes a so-so song can sound incredible when performed live and can help you re-appreciate the song. <br /> <br />I like \\"The Edge\\"-like guitar riffs, the electric organ mood, and Vangelis/Brian Eno kind of touches.  The album almost seems like an homage to U2, Kraftwerk, etc.  The drums are kind of weak though.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I wanted to watch this movie in the theatre but ended up renting it.  To my surprise, I thought it was pretty good.  I have read the Illiad but that was ages ago and don't claim to remember much of it at all although I do enjoy Greek myths.  Now, as for this film itself, as an adaptation and a movie on its own, no comparing with the myth itself, I would say that this was a great movie.  Yes, a lot of the facts have been changed greatly but that was the decision of the director and screenwriters.  I'm judging this only as a movie on its own, not as a comparison to the actual myth itself and I have to say that, for the most part, the acting was great.  Brad Pitt and Eric Bana did a superb job in their roles.  I especially rooted for Eric Bana's character.  He seemed such a convincing nobleman.  I couldn't care less for Helen of Troy nor Paris (played by Orlando Bloom) and I thought it had to do with the script more than the acting.  The story itself was exciting and the fight scenes thrilling and well choreographed.  Some cheeky humor as well I thought.  With that said, 4 stars for a movie to entertain and good eye candy.
B00003CXCT|5.0|These films are classics and will always be remembered as the greatest film saga of all time. They have stood the test of time and after almost thirty years, old and new fans love 'em.  <br /> <br />The Star Wars Trilogy's transfer to DVD doesn't dissapoint. With an entire other disc completely dedicated to special features, there's really not much you can complain about in that aspect. Also, the changed George Lucas has made to these films are mostly for the better. Adding Ian Mcdiarmid to The Empire Strikes Back to play as Emperor Palpatine when he's talking to Darth Vader through a hologram was a great idea that made the contiuity between all of the films better because Ian played Palpatine in Return of the Jedi and all of the prequel movies. Adding Hayden Christensen to the ending of Return of the Jedi as Anakin's spirit did the same because he played Anakin in Episodes II and III. At the end celebration in Return of the Jedi, one of the planets it shows celebrating is Naboo, which, again, helps with continuity. Boba Fett's voice has been re-recorded using the actor for Jango Fett, because in Episode II we learn that he is a clone of Jango Fett, so naturally he would have the same voice as him. Continuity is helped here also.  <br /> <br />In addition to these wonderful revisions the sound and picture quality is absolutely amazing. I couldn't ask for anything better. <br /> <br />If you are a Star Wars fan, a science fiction fan, or just a movie fan in general, these movies are must-haves.
1400082773|5.0|Barack Obama's account of his life experiences and journey to self-discovery is a page-turner that every person can relate to. Obama's story begins in Hawaii where his Kenyan father was mostly a myth and he is raised by his white mother. Obama's conflict of racial identity intensifies in college and becomes another of Obama's struggles: his want to belong to a community. The death of Obama's father adds another unresolved characteristic to his life that must be worked through. Obama finds a supportive community in Chicago as an organizer, where his intentions and actions are so pure, it is easy to think of him as a fictional character. The path to self discovery culminates in Obama's trip to Kenya where for the first time he meets his Father's family. Obama's intelligence and eloquence articulate his acceptance of himself and provides a model for others to follow. Obama's story is unique and his honesty inspires hope for insight on race and the necessity of the community provided by one's own family.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I have to say that I am very pleased with the latest effort from Coldplay.  They didn't venture into any unfamiliar territory on this album.  But, why fix something that is not broken?  Coldplay is one of the more talented bands in the world today.  The CD is a nice mix of uptempo arena rockers with the standard set of mid-tempo & ballads you'd expect.  The production work is stellar.  The songwriting is way above par.  This album lives up to the hype in my opinion.  It is one of the must have albums of 2005.   <br /> <br />I have to admit that it took 2-3 listens to fully appreciate the album and the quality of songs therein.  The same for me can be said of the first 2 albums.  I like that they have written overall more uptempo songs here.  I see plenty of radio hits here.  It's hard to say which songs are the best.  I think the whole album is just great.  Buy it, you won't be disappointed.
B000002UB3|5.0|Although Let It Be was released last, Abbey Road was actually the last album that The Beatles recorded, and that's the way I like to think of it. As the last Beatles album. And how is it? Well, it's pretty good. Actually, scratch that. It's one of the best rock albums in history and, along with The White Album, probably the best album that The Beatles ever released.  <br /> <br />The first song on the album is Come Together, which is a great start, and an excellent song by John. Then there's Something, one of George Harrison's most famous songs. It certainly is one of the best songs of all time, and shows that George was really starting to develop his musical talents, which he would later reveal in full force with his first solo album All Thing Must Pass. Of course, Here Comes The Sun also features on this album, and is also another George favorite. <br /> <br />Also, on side one, we have what is possibly my favorite Beatles song. Definitely up there in the top three. I Want You (She's So Heavy). This is one of these songs that you just never hear anymore. It starts off quite quiet, with a groovy little beat, and then starts getting \\"loud\\". I've always felt that if the apocalypse had to be represented with sound, the last two minutes of this song would sum it up pretty well. It feels as if the world is ending. It's just an amazing, amazing song and ends so abruptly, after seven minutes, that you actually have to take a minute to catch your breath, which is probably why they placed it at the end of side on. <br /> <br />Now, I'm not a Paul hater, but his two songs on the first side of the album are pretty weak. I've always felt that Maxwell's Silver Hammer and Oh, Darling! are sub-par compared to the rest of the first side, which is mostly excellent. Hell, I even like Octopus' Garden.  <br /> <br />What this album is probably most remembered by is the song medley on side two. It's basically a bunch of unfinished songs that John and Paul had lying around, that they melded into one. It's a great piece of work, especially the Golden Slumbers/Carry That Weight/The End sequence. <br /> <br />Overall, this album is a great way to end the wonderful career of The Beatles.
0446613444|4.0|Connelly packs enough gunfights, blood, deceptions, and wounded bodies and egos in this pressure-cooker of a novel to satiate the reader's appetite entirely. not as taut as it could have been, but entertaining nevertheless.
B000002UB6|4.0|The idea behind The Beatles' Let It Be album was to bring them back down to Earth. Have a change from the trippiness of their previous albums since Rubber Soul. So, The Beatles went into the studio and recorded some of their best work. Let It Be, The Long And Winding Road, Two Of Us, Get Back, Don't Let Me Down... The list goes on. The album was then titled Get Back And Other Songs, and had a cover reminiscent of their very first UK album Please Please Me. That version of the album was never relased, and then famed music producer Phil Spector came into the mix and changed the whole \\"back to basics\\" feel of the album, adding overdubs and other bells and whistles, much to Paul McCartney's chagrin. Over thirty years later, McCartney would finally have the album the way he wanted it when he released Let It Be... Naked. <br /> <br />I've never felt that Spector's production hurt the album. In fact, I'm a pretty big fan of this album, and although it has its flaws, it still conatins some of The Beatles best music. Of course, in my opinion, the two masterpieces on this album is Paul's Let It Be, and John's Don't Let Me Down. Even late on in their career as The Beatles, they weren't losing their touch. One of my other favorite songs on this album is George's I Me Mine, which was also the title of his autogiography. It sums up what he thinks about the materialistic people that the world is full of.  <br /> <br />It's hard to say if you should get this version of the album, or the Let It Be... Naked version. They both have their pros and cons. I'm a huge Beatles fans, so I have both and, although I've never really kept track, I've probably listened to this version of the album more than the Naked one. It's really up to personal opinion. Still, either version you get has a very similar tracklist and shows THe Beatles at thier best.

B0007OASII|5.0|I had heard clips of Kamelot in the past, with them starting out as a band that some have classified as \\"medieval metal.\\" Afterwords they became more progressive, but their music was so light it could hardly be classified as \\"metal.\\" Now they are back, they are heavier, but still are symphonic and melodic as hell.  <br /> <br />1. March of Mephisto 10/10- Kamelot show class by starting off with a mid-paced rocker as opposed to a fast power-metal type song. Khan is excellent on vocals and there is a guest appearance by Shagrath of Dimmu Borgir. Jens Johansson has a guest keyboard solo which is good, but the song could have benefitted from a guitar solo as well. <br />2. When the Lights Are Down 8/10- Here is the fast song that they normally start off with. Decent, with good solos by guitarist Youngblood as well as Johansson. <br />3. Somewhere in Time 9/10- Excellent ballad with Khan doing a duet with Epica lead singer Simone Simons. At times she sounds like the singer of Evanescence, but when they both sing together they are fantastic. <br />4. Soul Society 9/10- Great, melodic rocker with Khan giving a great vocal performance. <br />6. Abandoned 6/10- One of the few weak songs on the album isn't really bad, but nowhere near as good as the ones preceding it. <br />7. This Pain 7/10- Not bad, but somewhat forgettable. <br />8. Moonlight 10/10- One of the heavier songs on the disc, Youngblood has a fantastic riff and a brilliant guitar solo that's only fault is that it is too short. <br />10. The Black Halo 10/10- Youngblood takes the spotlight in this song with a fantastic guitar solo. <br />11. Nothing Ever Dies 8/10- Not bad, but ultimately forgettable. <br />12. Memento Mori 10/10- Kamelot's longest song ever is also arguably their best ever. Shagrath shows up once again as does a female simger known only as \\"Mari.\\" Both are fantastic as is Khan. Thomas Youngblood shines throughout both with his riffs and his two-part solo. <br />14. Serenade 10/10- One of the biggest faults of concept albums is that they very rarely have good and satisfying song to end them. Savatage mostly did lame ballads that sounded like they could be found on a disney soundtrack, while other bands have been almost as bad. Here that is not the case. I can't quite explain it, but as this song ends, it seems like a fitting way to close an incredible album. <br />5, 9, and 13 are all interludes the are great when listening to the album as a whole, but not individually. <br /> <br />For me, the album's major fault was that there was nothing to explain the concept for me. I think it is based off of some book, and it may be a continuation of their last album. I also wish that Youngblood had had more guitar solos, when he is given some room to work (\\"Moonlight,\\" \\"Memento Mori,\\" and \\"The Black Halo\\") he is fantastic. That being said, this is still an unbelievable album that shuns cliches and shows maturity in the band. All of the guests (I think there are 5) are very effective and add to the album immensely. Highly recommended.

B0009A1AS2|4.0|I consider myself a true Dream Theater fan, being the proud owner of the previous 7 studio albums. Octavarium marks the 8th album recorded with the current band line up minus Keyboardists Jordan Ruhdes (his 4th) It is surly right to say that Dream Theater has had quite a journey. With every new release there was always something new to hear from this power group, and unfortunately for a time some of the fans (myself included) felt that Dream Theater was losing their touch. With their previous release `Train Of Thought' I felt that they weren't really trying to bring their fans something new. Rather, continue the dark and heavy sound that was first brought to us through `Six Degrees Of Inner Turbulence' I mean...the album came out pretty quickly as well.<br /><br />I am happy to say that with 'Octavarium', Dream Theater really shows their talent full circle. You can hear their entire career in these eight tracks. Also they also were making a bold statement for Jordan Ruhdes saying \\"Back off he's here to stay!\\" Jordan really shows his skills with the 88 keys and even with a steel guitar as well. One could say this is 'his' best album...I mean if you really want to dive deep into thought here...the piano keys on the album cover must stand for something.<br /><br />The songs on this album are a balance of good and evil in a sense. There are positive tracks like the light `I Walk Beside You' to the fast and dark thrash sound of `Panic Attack'. The best songs on this album by far are the last two. `Sacrificed Sons' is a powerful ballad to the fallen in 9/11, as well as a reminder as to who committed the act 4 years ago. The self titled track `Octavarium' is nothing short of brilliant. It has a very distinct similarity to Pink Floyd the founders of Dream Theater's genere of music. Dream Theater really cranks it out on that one and it really is a song you just never heard from them before.<br /><br />Even though this album is a good listen, as a true fan it just doesn't live up to the albums of the past. Dream Theater's career is like a story. It began with `Images And Words' and reached the climax at `Scenes From A Memory. I don't want to say the band is going downhill, but it seems to me that their run may be drawing to a close. On the plus side, the members are working on separate projects and if the band ends up calling it quits we still will not have lost them for good.

0380730367|5.0|Lehane strikes gold once again with this kenzie/gennaro adventure. although, the reader must have realized by now that his titles don't really have anything to do with the plot (except, gone, baby, gone, mystic river and shutter island), one can't deny the fact that Lehane is one of the very best there is.
B000002BYA|5.0|Once in a while a live album really adds to an artist's legacy, producing something different and exciting, rather than just reproducing his studio sound with added crowd noise.  \\"Live At Carnegie Hall\\" is such an album. Stevie Ray Vaughan and Double Trouble, recorded the day after Vaughan's 30th birthday with the on-stage assistance of Stevie's brother Jimmie Lee Vaughan on second guitar, Dr John on his customary piano, and the Roomful of Blues horn section popping up on several tracks.    The sound is perhaps not quite as crystal clear as on the magnificent recording of Stevie Ray Vaughan's 1982 Montreux appearence, but it is more than good enough. And the band tear through some of their best songs, including the irresistable \\"Pride And Joy\\", a horn-augumented version of the slow blues \\"Dirty Pool\\", a superb, tough rendition of \\"Honey Bee\\" with some truly muscular guitar playing from the Vaughan brothers, and an equally great \\"Cold Shot\\".    Vaughan relies quite a lot on instrumentals (they make up five of the thirteen numbers), and it would perhaps have been nice to have a couple more vocal performances...Stevie Ray was a really fine rock n' roll singer, and he sounded great on this particular night.  But that's a matter of taste, of course, and these instrumentals shouldn't be disregarded by any means. The opener, \\"Scuttle Buttin'\\", is particularly fiery, and there are fine renditions of \\"Testifyin'\\" and a horn-augumented \\"Iced Over\\" here as well.    \\"Live At Carnegie Hall\\" also includes a few rare performances, particularly Eddie \\"Guitar Slim\\" Jones' \\"Letter To My Girlfriend\\", the instrumental \\"Iced Over\\" and Leo Gooden's \\"C.O.D.\\" (originally recorded by Albert King) which Vaughan never recorded anywhere else. On \\"C.O.D.\\" he is joined by Texas blues singer Angela Strehli (check out her album \\"Soul Shake\\").  All in all, \\"Live At Carnegie Hall\\" is a very welcome addition to Stevie Ray Vaughan's too-brief catalogue. And to those who are wary of Vaughan working with a horn section - don't worry, he remains front and center, and his playing and singing is nowhere near overwhelmed by the presence of additional musicians.  Five stars easy. Truly excellent!

B00000ICN5|5.0|Rarely does a year go by without some new artist being proclaimed the greatest thing since music's birth, and when I first heard of Stevie Ray Vaughan, I was a bit wary. With so many people talking about him as if he was the second coming of Jimi Hendrix, something had to be amiss.    Well, it isn't. The late Stevie Ray Vaughan was actually every bit as great as he was made out to be, and his debut album is by far the best collection of blues-rock and contemporary blues of the first half of the 80s, holding up wonderfully more than twenty years later.    This record brought the blues back into the limelight. It spent some seven months on the American charts (an extremely rare feat for what is essentially a blues record), and it includes several of Stevie Ray Vaughan's very best songs:  The blistering rockers \\"Love Struck Baby\\" and \\"I'm Cryin'\\" are here, as well as the magnificent slow blues \\"Texas Flood\\" and \\"Dirty Pool\\", an excellent rendition of Buddy Guy's blues-slash-nursery rhyme \\"Mary Had A Little Lamb\\", and of course Stevie Ray's most famous song, the sublime \\"Pride And Joy\\".    Stevie Ray Vaughan knew not only the form but also the substance of the blues, and his guitar playing is masterful. Vaughan had an incredibly ability to keep his solos sounding fresh and innovative, even when they went on for several minutes at a time, and he was a more than adequate singer as well, switching effortlessly between rock n' roll and slow, soulful blues tunes.  His playing on this album is as good as anything he ever recorded, and it's not hard to see why Eric Clapton once stated that he found himself \\"in the presence of greatness\\" upon hearing Vaughan play.    This CD reissue adds five bonus tracks, one of which is a short interview snippet. The other four include a very good live take on \\"Mary Had A Little Lamb\\", and the otherwise unreleased instrumental \\"Wham\\" (unreleased except on compilations, that is).  And everything here, rockers, blues, instrumentals and bonus cuts, is worth a listen. Many listens. \\"Texas Flood\\" is a magnificent blues record, Vaughan's finest original album, and it should appeal to fans of both blues and rock. And, well, music.
0688163173|4.0|a stark departure from his bread-and-butter, this Lehane novel is not half as intriguing as his kenzie/gennaro outings. the action is explosive, but rare, and the humor is nonexistent. it dwells way too much on describing the surroundings, but the twist at the end is very well done and incisively portrayed. worth reading once.
0380789035|1.0|I can honestly say this is one of the worst novels I've ever read.  It was a very cool idea, and seemed dark, which is what attacted me to the book.  Also, my sister had announced to the family: \\"NOBODY is allowed to read American Gods; it is TERRIBLE.\\"  Well, I don't usually agree with my sister - we have differing tastes.  So I bought the book and read it.  It was almost as bad as reading Cold Mountain.  In other words, it is a VERY difficult read.  It is torture to turn the pages.  It is bloated with history and ideas, but there is simply not a compelling plot here.  It is BORING.  It just plods along and you keep waiting for something to happen - for that plot point that ties it all together.  There is no payoff.  I actually finished this book, wiating for that pay-off.  It never came.  Total waste of my time.  Gaiman took the ideas and history of American gods and basically used it to create characters based on those gods.  But they aren't real characters, so as interesting as they are, they fall flat.  And it really all makes no sense.  The book is tonally inconsistent.  OK enough of this rant.<br /><br />You have been warned:  my sister is was right.  \\"Nobody is allowed to read this book!\\"

B0009I7NNA|3.0|There are a few interesting and heavy melodic aspects on the album. A7X widen there sound but fall short of any real substance. I also believe the album is way over produced and  overall the songs lack any bite. As you might have  read M. Shawdows had vocal chord surgery last year cause he damaged the chords so bad. Now he sounds like a whiny Scott Weiland and a weak John Corabi mixed together. I hate the tone that he is using. This is so very unfortunate for the band 'cause I felt like they really had something going on. Really want to appreciate the band pick up 'WTF\\" right now. You will hear how  powerful M. shawdows voice once was. Think of an even balance of Phil Anselmo and General Mke Patton!

The first few seconds of Beast and the Harlot are really good, sounds like they got heavier and the drummer became way better but then it all goes down hill when the chorus comes in. Also, the singer sucks ass here, he does no range whatsoever, everything is very half ass high pitched. WTF was amazing but it seems as if they can't pull that off twice.

B0007Y08I8|5.0|Team America is one of the most hilarious movies I have ever seen. I had to temporarily pause the dvd midway because my stomach hurt from laughing.  <br /> <br />Its politics are refreshing (taking major swipes at both nationalists and the Hollywood liberal ego-trippers), the puppets' expressions are priceless, the speeches (and song lyrics) are very clever, and if you don't end up on the floor during the lovemaking scene, well, you're just hopeless. This is the sort of movie you have to see more than once, because you just know there are all sorts of nuances you missed the first time around... <br /> <br />I've never seen South Park, but I've got to check it out sometime; these guys have an irreverant and razor-sharp humor which is unique and very, very welcome. <br /> <br />Fuddy duddies with no sense of humor when it comes to their politics should definitely beware. Everyone else, dive right in and enjoy!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This is System of a Down's new album and it's pretty good. This album doesn't compare to Toxicity though. \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" is getting annoying because it comes on the radio so much but it's still a good song. \\"Cigaro\\" is a good song but it's really short at only about two minutes and 30 seconds but it's classic System of a Down. \\"Revenga\\" is such a good song and I would recommed listening to it and this song should convince you to buy the album. Steal This Album! was a very good CD with hits like \\"F**k the System\\" and \\"Boom!.\\" Toxicity has the hits \\"Chop Suey!,\\" \\"Toxicity,\\" \\"Aerials,\\" and \\"Prison Song.\\" Their first self-entitled album was good but there just wasn't enough hits to make it an awesome CD. Their supposed to have a CD that's called Hypnotize but I'm not sure if it's out or not because in some websites they say that it was supposed to be out March 2005 and was supposed to be the first half of their album. I'm not sure but hopefully I get Hypnotize too.  <br /> <br />1. Soldier Side - Intro: 7/10 <br />2. B.Y.O.B. - 10/10 <br />3. Revenga - 10/10 <br />4. Cigaro - 9/10 <br />5.

He uses a story form to educate the readers on the problems with typically inflicted governmental action in about 25 areas  including the following:  government 'make work' projects, taxes, credit, machinery, reductions in numbers of government employees, tariffs, price fixing, subsidizing commodities, rent control, minimum wage laws, unions, profits, and attacks on savings.<br /><br />As politicians around the world, including the United States, regularly make harmful errors in their attempts to buy votes, this should be required reading for all of them, as well as college economics professors who are so enamoured with Keynes and Marx.<br /><br />Hazlitt does a great job in making the case that, prior to taking action on economic issues, decision makers should look at the effect on everyone involved (not just the groups that they are trying to seduce into voting for them) as well as the long range implications of the policy.<br /><br />Readers should come away from reading this with a clear understanding of the marvels of a free market (if we were ever allowed to have one) and the incredibly damaging effects of governmental manipulations of the economy.  I would strongly  recommend this for reading by all voters who want to be knowlegeable as well as all elected and appointed officials.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This is truly Mariah's comeback album and the return of her voice.  An extremely consistent seller, the album recently returned to #1, her 8th week on the chart.  Pair this with the fact that Mariah's been doing this for around 15 years, sold over 150 million records (singles and albums), and has had more #1 singles and spent more days on the top of the Billboard charts than any other female artist (second only to legends like the Beatles and Elvis), and it's easy to see that this woman has got a longevity and success that no one can match.  This album would be a triumph, even without the success (in sales and critically) that it has received.  It marks the return of a new Mariah - one that is happy again, no longer the laughingstock she was just years ago.  With her biggest first-week sales ever and continuing to sell huge each week, this album looks to be one of the top-sellers of the year.  Though the world wrote her off, Mimi is back and she's here to stay!  The album features Snoop Dogg, Jermaine Dupri (aka JD), Twista, and Nelly, with backing vocals by Fatman Scoop and Trey Lorenz.  Notable artists producing include The Neptunes and Kanye West.   <br /> <br />1) It's Like That - The opening club-banging track and first single gets your ass shaking!  The heavy bass and the feel-good lyrics will make you feel \\"lifted\\" and \\"you'll like it!\\"  JD's part is extremely catchy and Fatman Scoop's rap, though brief, is very effective.  Mariah showcases her voice brilliantly along with his hot rap at the end.  Definitely one of the hottest dance tracks of the year and a great single to kick off this mint album!  <br /> <br />2) We Belong Together - What more can I say about Mariah's 16th #1 Hot 100 single (currently #1 for its third week and there'll probably be more weeks to come) and the song that just set a new record for MOST played song on American radio in a week?  That's right, you heard me!  The most played song on Rhythmic radio, this mid-tempo R&B ballad also has huge numbers on Pop (inhibited only by Gwen's \\"Hollaback Girl\\", currently at #2 with high spins), Urban, and Urban AC radio, and has set a record with over 22, 400 spins and over 192 million audience impressions in one week!  This song has been racing up every chart its entered, while its music video has also spent many days at #1 on MTV's TRL.  Mariah's biggest song in ages, \\"Mimi\\" also returned to #1 this past week, making this her first #1 single/album combo since 1996's \\"Daydream\\"/\\"One Sweet Day\\".  This is Mariah's true comeback and nobody can take that away from her!  This proves that Mariah is, without a doubt, the world's #1 female artist.   <br /> <br />3) Shake It Off - This track will make you \\"bounce\\"!  A very light and catchy track, it has been confirmed to be the 3rd single off \\"Mimi\\".  This song will get stuck in your head in no time! <br /> <br />4) Mine Again - One of Mariah's best vocal performances in a long time, showcasing her near-perfect voice!  Her effortless glide over the octaves is probably not as amazing as it once was, but this is the closest it's been in a long time!  A true \\"song for the ages\\" as many call it.   <br /> <br />5) Say Somethin' - A hip-hop lover's dream: Mariah, Snoop Dogg, and the Neptunes!  Hot, funky, and danceable track and extremely sexy, Mariah and Snoop have awesome chemistry in this one!  `Nuff said! <br /> <br />6) Stay The Night - Mariah really belts in this one!  One of Kanye's best, it has a 70's soul feel to it.  Definitely one of the highlights on the album, again doing wonders at displaying Mariah's huge voice. <br /> <br />7) Get Your Number - This is probably my favorite track of the album.  Many have complained that JD is annoying and sounds like Nelly, but I think he does a great job.  This is probably the best dance track on the album and the one you can see everyone clubbing to.  An extremely fun song to sing along to and dance to, this would make an awesome single!   <br /> <br />8) One and Only - \\"Twista and Mariah, together like a grip on a tire!\\"  These two really do fit well together and Mariah proves she can keep up with Twista's rapping in this hot and smooth track.   <br /> <br />9) Circles - Another excellent mid-tempo R&B ballad, Mariah again samples old school music.  Very well-done. <br /> <br />10) Your Girl - An upbeat, sexy song with more old-school vibes.  Another feel-good track that'll make you sing along! <br /> <br />11) I Wish You Knew - A very nice ballad that many can relate to.  Mariah pulls a Alicia Keys on this one and talks, while the audience claps.  Has a \\"show-y\\" feeling to it and makes you feel like you're watching this in a theatre.  Again, showcasing Mariah's enormous range and control.   <br /> <br />12) To The Floor - The REAL Nelly is on this track and it's a very slick hip-hop track.  Mariah uses a very subtle, sexy voice on this one, while Nelly goes easy on the song, not overdoing it.  Hot beats and Mariah is again able to complement the rapping with her vocals.   <br /> <br />13) Joyride - The most beautiful love song on the album and also the \\"poppiest\\" song of the album, though it also has an R&B feel to it.  I think any pop artist could sing this song and I would love it, but Mariah makes it that much more special.  For most of the song, Mariah uses a very beautiful soft voice, but then belts at the end and hits some ridiculously high notes!  Again, it is just lovely! <br /> <br />14) Fly Like A Bird - What a way to close the album!  Mariah's voice gets progressively stronger as the song goes on and it closes with a full choir.  Mariah's voice simply soars on this song, filling you with joy and hope!  This is Mariah at her best - her singing is almost ecstatic, a true throwback to some of her earlier stuff!  Perfect! <br /> <br />Phew!  What a simply amazing album!  A perfect blend of hot, dance/hip-hop tracks and smooth, lovely r&b/pop ballads, with some old-school soul and gospel thrown in!  I think the album is going to continue selling extremely well and I have no doubt that Mariah is going to keep on hitting the top of the charts with these excellent tracks, perhaps even reaching the Beatles and Elvis in terms of success on the Billboard charts!  I think the verdict from critics and fans is pretty much clear: MIMI IS BACK!!!!!!
B0002DB50E|5.0|I can't understand the complaints from that previous reviewer. The screenplay itself and deleted footage from television didn't seem important enough to make it into this version, especially since this is approved by Cronenberg himself! There isn't going to be another edition to top this one, otherwise it would have already come out! I don't see Univeral coming out with something else any time soon! Pick it up today.
B000002H6C|5.0|A masterpiece in its own right, and Justice for All pushes the band to the edge one last time. Lyrically deep and musically impressive, the album hits fast and hard. Vocals are dark and angry to match the lyrics, while the guitarwork is heavy and technical. Metallica employs lots of new technique to fill out their metal mastery, yet makes the songs more addicting than before. Riffs from Harvester of Sorrow and Eye of the Beholder will get in your head and stay there for weeks. Vocal hooks from One and the title track might even last longer. Special credit also goes to the Cliff Burton tribute, To Live is to Die. An epic almost-instrumental, it demonstrates a musical passion uncommon in heavy metal. True Metallica fans will relish in this albums glory. ...And Justice Forever
B000002HMH|3.0|Disappointment only begins to describe my feelings about this cd. To begin, I'm going to refrain from referring to it as a Metallica album as much as possible, as the sound that Metallica created in the 80's does not manifest itself here. What does exist is a generally heavy modern rock band that has a slightly better, rougher sound than its contemporaries. I should be describing a flatout amazing album that defines its genre and crushes all that oppose. Instead I'm left with a mediocre album with a few tolerable songs that people will still buy and love and declare Metallica musical geniuses for developing their sound and 'maturing'. Ugh. Anyway, I'll try and point out the positives for the mainstream fans. <br />Since the emphasis is now on songwriting, there are tons of hooks and creative vocals on this cd. Hero of the Day is a good example as is Until It Sleeps. Besides these, Ronnie is probably the best song. Well written and addictive, you'll be humming it for awhile. <br />As for the rest of the album, it's an amalgam of generic/unoriginal/uninspired mainstream rock with a little bit of a metal riff edge. Blues are infused in 2X4 and The House That Jack Built has a decent clean riff. The absolute worst song is Mama Said, which works around a country/folk riff on an acoustic. It's an anti-Metallica song sung by Metallica. Please avoid this.
B000002HRE|2.0|Load was a scuff on the Metallica logo. Reload is a stain. Many claim that the album features good songwriting and originality and that if Metallica kept producing thrash albums they would get repetitive. This album is repetitive not only in and of itself(Reload, as in Load again), but features little diversion from mediocrity among its own songs. The only stand out song is the riling The Unforgiven II. Working off a theme from the Black album, a powerful and original song is composed that's surprisingly effective. The rest of the album is stale. Fuel is much weaker than it first appears and The Memory Remains, while creepy, isn't technical nor is it well-written. I liked Low Man's Lyric, but it isn't Metallica. If you look at this album as though it was released by another band, it shines a little, but like Load, reality tarnishes it heavily. Don't buy.
B000002H97|4.0|Too many people discredit this album's release as the day metal died. It's a shame to look at it that way. Yes, I'll agree that the Black album was the first step towards what Metallica would soon become(trash metal), but it doesn't mar the album any. Think of it in terms of Slayer's South of Heaven. It's slower, more melodic, shorter songs, more vocally/lyrically influenced, but it in no way demonstrates the trend of \\"selloutism\\". Just a change of pace, though i wish they would have kicked the pace back up after it. The technical songs shine here. Many songs off the album became radio hits, such as the creepy Enter Sandman, heavy Sad But True, and power ballad Nothing Else Matters, but they aren't the highlights. Don't Tread on Me runs on classic Metallica power while The Struggle Within presents a new blend of conceptual riffing and The Unforgiven provides a true One-like power ballad with amazing hooks and unforgettable riffs. Buy it if you aren't afraid of liking it. You won't be a sellout in my eyes.
B00000FCBC|4.0|For those who claim that Metallica has not sold out, simply remove Disc 1 of Garage Inc. from your cd players and insert Disc 2. Covering songs by similar bands on both, a certain ferocity is lost between the two discs. Yes I prefer the second disc. The Small Hours, The Wait, Blitzkrieg, Am I Evil?, and Helpless all represent beautiful genuine thrash innovation. Plus Metallica nails them. The punkier crazy songs were cool as well, So What, Last Caress/Green Hell, Crash Course in Brain Surgery. I enjoyed all but the last few songs of disc 2. Disc 1 is not terrible, but it could have been better. Highlights include Whiskey in the Jar, Tuesday's Gone, It's Electric, Sabbra Cadabra, Mercyful Fate, and the incredible Turn the Page. Fans of Metallica and fans of the original will like.
1400032717|3.0|I did enjoy this book, but there were times that a felt urged just to skip a paragraph or two. I guess this book would be good to read small bits over time not all at once. At least for me, it got a little over whelming reading so many pages about math or the likes, but once I chopped up my reading of the book I enjoyed it quite a bit more.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|When the credits roled after the ridiculous horror movie Alone in the Dark, a pretty good tune started playing, so when I saw a music video for the song(Wish I Had An Angel) in the bonus features I checked it out. And thus began my love affair with Nightwish.  I haven't really been into metal since the early nineties- taking a detour through punk, industrial, and then techno- but after getting Once, I'm certain to be a Nightwish fan for life.   <br />As I'm pushing 30, I really don't harbor the angst or emotion of my youth, so most aggressive music just doesn't do it for me anymore- esp. nu-metal(but hey, the kids of every generation have to have something to annoy everyone else with, I guess).  But Once is something that stirs a basic, emotional part of me, and I would categorize it as something I would never have called metal before- beautiful.
B0007Y08QA|3.0|It is possible to savor a movie for its style and mood more than for what it actually has to say. In his commentary, director Brad Anderson calls it \\"cool and creepy . . . a parable about guilt,\\" and no one who sees \\"The Machinist\\" will argue with that. It holds your interest without engaging your mind or emotions because nothing in it makes sense until the end when some (not all) of the mystery is resolved. But by then it's too late. We already have concluded that Anderson could have found a less convoluted and just as interesting way of telling a story that is not really that strange.     Christian Bale, an intelligent young actor whose choice of roles is unusually varied, lost 63 pounds to play a machinist who causes an industrial accident and ends up consumed with insomnia, guilt, paranoia and, finally, maybe as puzzled as the audience. For this is one of those movies in which characters, locations, even entire scenes, are figments of the imagination. You may or may not realize this afterwards, chatting over coffee with friends, but certainly not while watching the movie.     The Los Angeles locations are rather captivating until you realize that the entire film was shot in Barcelona and Andorra using Spanish and English actors to support Bale and Jennifer Jason Leigh, playing (another!) gold-hearted hooker who helps him. As the only American on the Spanish crew, Anderson says it fell to him to \\"Americanize\\" everything; any anachronisms you spot (there are a few) he hopes you will excuse as the \\"surrealism\\" he says is inherent in the script, a sort of poor man's \\"Memento,\\" and his approach to it.     Bale, always a brave actor, is the real reason to watch \\"The Machinist\\"; his skeletal body is unnerving to see, and his relentlessness carries the narrative. But skip Anderson's self-serving commentary. He likens his film to those of Alfred Hitchcock, even uses an ersatz Bernard Hermann score. He fills it with symbols (the Pieta is invoked) and incident that his commentary has to explain, and tells us what a terrific movie he has made. Don't worry. Hitchcock's reputation remains intact.
B0009QBLA8|4.0|Often called the greatest cult film of all time, \\"Eraserhead\\" is unlikely to blow you away if you're: 1. seeing it on a small screen; 2. viewing one of the 2nd-rate Asian DVD copies widely available on the internet; 3. already familiar with \\"Elephant Man\\" and/or \\"Blue Velvet,\\" both of which combine all of the visual, aural, and thematic elements of \\"Eraserhead\\" with topnotch production values.<br /><br />As for \\"Eraserhead,\\" think of it as a combination of Kafka's \\"Metamorphoses\\" and T. S. Eliot's \\"The Wasteland\\" told in the cinematic style of Bunuel/Dali's \\"Un Chien Andalou.\\"  The area in which Lynch strikes me as inarguably inventive if not innovative is in the use of the soundtrack to convey narrative and emotional meaning.  Not since Orson Welles (who parlayed his radio creativity into movie fame) has a filmmaker found more ways for representing the sonic dimensions of human experience.  Whereas Welles used reverberation in conjunction with deep focus to convey the sense of space separating human beings, Lynch employs much \\"white noise\\" to take us into an \\"inner space\\" of expectation, anxiety, and dread.  Put another way, he's a master at recording the \\"silence\\" that, as Robert Frost puts it in \\"Desert Places,\\" scares us all.<br /><br />Besides the emptiness of his spiritless surroundings, Henry (the protagonist) clearly suffers from acute anxieties towards women--they entice, seduce, threaten, trap and abandon, alternately motivate and disintegrate any sense of \\"self,\\" their biology constantly returning him to a natural \\"muck\\" that is hardly a satisfying alternative to the denatured and depressing industrial world.<br /><br />I'm left pondering the meaning of the title.  Henry's high hairdo could be described as an eraser, though it looks more like a broom or brush hiding the pinhead-sized structure beneath it.  When Henry loses his head (quite literally) and a boy brings it to a pencil factory, we get our fullest glimpse of what Lynch might have in mind.  The \\"natural\\" wood of the pencils is parodied by their assembly-line production.  When the machine operator occasionally tests one of the pencils by scribbling something and then immediately erasing it, we sense the illusory quality of human thought and the notion of a coherent and continuous \\"self.\\"  In that respect, human identity along with what I've just written and the film itself are all extremely tenuous and erasable--an ending that might be viewed as the antithesis to that of \\"The Elephant Man\\" (\\"Nothing can ever die. Nothing\\").pencils is parodied by their assembly-line production.

B00003CXA3|5.0|There are a million reasons why this movie is such a classic, but I will give two:     Gene Hackman  Cool car chases    This is a classic cop drama with cop bravado, but what sets this movie apart from the norm are the acting capabilities of Gene Hackman and the EXCELLENT bashing of cars.     Come on, if you already watched this movie you don't need me to give you a blow by blow of the story. Suffice it to say that this movie was done very well in 1971 and it still stands the test of time today.     If you are a fan of Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry movies, or Bruce Willis Die Hard movies, you will like this film.

B0006L16N8|5.0|This is great work by a band that has its own distinct niche in an industry that is a shadow of its former self.  There is real excitement surrounding the release of this cd.  This used to happen all the time, but is rare these past ten years.  Coldplay is an exception to the rule, and rule they do.  Chris Martin is a great storyteller and the songs weave wonderfully from first to last track.  Strong effort from a band with real intelligence.
B00003CXSP|4.0|After the initial acclimatization to Julianne Moore as Clarice Starling I became absorbed with how well the screen writers adapted the novel to film.  Besides, everyone was there for the title character anyway and this time there's definitely more for Lecter to chew on.<br /><br />Another plus was the haunting performance given by Gary Oldman.  I can't help but think that this film would have been award bound if Foster had agreed to reprise her role as Starling.  While Moore did an admirable job different people playing the same role only works on stage.  Ridley Scott's direction is, as always, astounding(I'm still irked by his inexcusable loss to Soderbergh in 2000).<br /><br />Hannial is even better the second time around as you are less shocked and more capable of noticing the nuances each actor brings to their roles.  I still don't understand how Anthony Hopkins didn't at least get another Oscar nod.<br /><br />If you saw The Silence of the Lambs you should at least rent Hannibal, if only to see Hopkins as the good doctor.  Also, for you sickos out there Hannibal has one of the most disturbing endings ever in a widely released theatrical film.<br /><br />Bon Appetit!
B00079FUI6|5.0|Great Show!! Kudos!!  Me and my mom routinely watched every sunday night and now that the season's over, it totally left me wanting more!  I'm so excited that it's coming out on DVD and I CANNOT wait until Sept. 20, 2005!!!!!!!!!!!!!1 :D
B000003TAB|5.0|first off i would like 2 say for the more casual fan this is way better than the box set, so if you are intrested in nirvana get this over the box set. <br />1.Dive- very cool song one of my favorites and a great live song <br />2.Sliver-the best known song of this album it is a very cool punky song <br />3.stain-a great song that i like alot, its very raw and cool <br />4.Been a son-i dont really like this song and dont see how this got on the best of album <br />5.Turnaround-great cover of a Devo song i like this song alot <br />6.molly's lips-a vaselines cover that im not 2 fond of <br />7.son of a gon-another vaselines cover really doesnt appeal 2 me <br />8.new wave polly-polly sounded better done slower this is 2 fast paced and ruins a good song <br />9.beeswax-a great early song one of the best on this album. <br />10.downer- a good song that came off of bleach <br />11.mexican seafood-this song is ok it has pretty disguisting lyrics about a yeast infection <br />12.hairspray queen-i dont really no what 2 think about this song , but i like its weirdness <br />13.aero-zepplin-this is a great song it doesnt really sound like led zeppelin or aerosmith but i still like it. <br />14.big long now- a song i like very much it is very oppresive and depressed sounding but great none the less. <br />15.anyerusym-now this song is a treat one of nirvana's best songs and the best song on this great collection this song is awesome. <br />                      so all in all out of 15 tracks only 4 of them are just ok so i would highly recommend this album 2 ne1 who is intrested in nirvana or owns bleach. you wont b disappointed
B0009I7NNA|1.0|I'm going to start off by saying \\"waking the fallen\\" is prob one of my favorite punk/hardcore records of all time, and with that said I can say \\"City of Evil\\" is one of the biggest letdowns ever, it's also one of worst cds I now have in my collection. <br />Mind you the music all around is great, but WOW when shadows starts to sing I wanted to cry, his damaged voice should have never been put on this alblum. <br />It sucks he injured his vocal cords, but Avenged Sevenfold should have never recorded this record, and let down countless A7F fans. <br />Get a NEW singer or have shadows do the clean vocals and someone else do the screams, something other then this trash!! <br /> <br />Listen to samples before buying.........or find yourself crying :(
B00007E8V4|4.0|SOAD number 3 is just as consistent and dynamic as ever, it just doesn't hold up to the classics on the other cds. Political lyrics are at their best here on Boom, F the System, and ADD while Innervision, Streamline, and Ego Brain give you a little more melody with your music. 36 is a rapid, ultrashort commentary while Mr. Jack is creepy and humorous. The other songs are good, mixing metal and clean riffs/melodies that variate the music, but again no real standouts, except Roulette, which is entirely acoustic. Best song is Chic N Stu, the epitome of randomness even over some of the other songs on this album. Buy it if you like System. Steal it if you don't.
B00006CXXU|4.0|Christina Aguilera's sophomore effort Stripped turned out to be a success in the end, mainly due to its expressionistic tracklist (many of which were co-written by the pop singer).  Now overplayed \\"Beautiful\\" is a decent pop ballad and Aguilera's typical overpowering melismas seem to fit it better than, say, in \\"Dirrty\\"; but save for that one Grammy-winning track and only a handful of others almost every other song lacks the ubiquitousness of material heard in reigning teen queen Britney Spears' CDs.  Stripped's consistency isn't the problem: Jessica Simpson's Irresistible was an incredibly marketable and consistent release, but, like aforementioned Stripped, lacked any major hit tuneage.  It's good, but is it memorable?  You decide.
B000021YQV|4.0|Toxicity is the first Soad album that I heard. At first listen, it was random and unlikable. But it grows on you, much like mold on an old sandwich. Toxicity is awesome, taking what made the first great and continuing in consistency. <br /> <br />The album opens heavy with Prison Song, Needles and Deer Dance blasting the hell out of any speakers. Jet Pilot is a little obscure in both rhythm and lyrics, but should catch on. Same with X. Chop Suey, the title track, and Aerials are the radio hits, with the first two being absolute classics. I think Aerials is weak and overplayed, while the outro Arto is just unneccessary. Shimmy is the best song on the album while Science and Forest are cool too. I'm giving it a 4 because the songs don't offer the same variety and depth as those from the first, although ATWA makes for a nice softer song and Psycho is pretty insane. And for those that think Bounce is stupid and random, try checking around for what the lyrics actually represent(via old interviews). Then you'll just call it random.

It matters because it has opened up a world of possibility for a group that had been locked out of opportunity. It also matters because by fixing the first impression at the heart of the audition--by judging purely on the basis of ability--orchestras now hire better musicians, and better musicians mean better music. And how did we get better music? Not by rethinking the entire classical music enterprise or building new concert halls or pumping in millions of new dollars, but by paying attention to the tiniest detail, the first two seconds of the audition.
B000007T1M|5.0|This album will blow you away. As mentioned by others, it's not really numetal so much as it is thrashy, progressive, raw, crazy metal. The songs are dynamic, and almost random at times. Lyrics range from angry to intelligent to profound to obscure while Serj's vocal range compensates for low clean singing to high wailing and deep roaring. Know, Sugar, War?, Darts and PLUCK, Suite Pee, and D-Devil will hit you hard. Suggestions and Spiders use more clean riffs. Peephole and Soil throw in some obvious eastern european influence. Mind and CUBErt will test your brainpower (metaphors or insanity?). Every song on the album is memorable. It may take a few listens to get into, but it's worth the effort. Enjoy
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Napoleon Dynamite could have been written entirely by a software program; it's that soulless.  \\"Are you crazy?\\"  I can hear aficionados cry.  \\"Why, it's an iconoclastic indie!  The protagonist is a nerd with a wacky name!  He's got a crush on the weird girl who's pretty but doesn't know it!  His grandma rides a dune-buggy and owns a llama!  You just can't get any more 'out there' than that!\\" <br /> <br />Please.  Napoleon Dynamite is as \\"quirky\\" as the Wall Street Journal.  It was distributed by MTV, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Viacom, perhaps the most powerful media conglomerate in the US.  If you want to see a movie that humorously plumbs the essential strangeness of the human condition, try David Byrne's True Stories or the first two Christopher Guest films (Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show).  They're not flawless, but they have heart, and a genuine point of view.  They are the real deal.  Napoleon Dynamite is a pale imitation; a 60-year-old CEO's concept of \\"one of those nutty indies the kids seem to like.\\"  And so many people fell for it.  Sad.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|After the less profane, slightly mainstream sounding albums that followed their classic debut, System ressurects their original spirit and fuses it with the lyrical progressivism that made their last two albums so beloved. While many songs do have a certain 'radio song' feel to them, it's in mockery alone. The albums is fast, powerful, and significant. Lyrics are masterful, vocals are incredible, and the guitarwork has never been better. The whole album is a commentary that sells not because it meets expectations, but because it breaks them. Expect profanity, anger, sadness, humor, and pure satisfaction.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|Dexterity is pointless without good writing. I can't find anything on this cd that is from the heart or well thought out. I've been hanging in there w/ the last 2 cds, but DT really needs a writer and a producer. I don't want images + awake pt2, but I do want the same amount of heart, passion and well thought out lyrics and melodies. They could do an acoustic albulm or an acapella cd, but no matter what style, it has to have Well thought out melodies. Singers don't write well thought out melodies. Writers who understand what notes fit over chords do that. Instrumental sections should also be well thought out. Not just random pastings. Get Kevin back + hire a producer.  Untill then, Rudess is just going noodle elp + various other influences from his past.  Rudess needs music on paper. He can read....not necessarilly write. Also what's up w/ being influenced by the younger generation.Since  Kevin left, they have been copying everyone from u2 to tool + muse.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This review is for people who have listened to \\"Parachutes\\" an \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\" a million times and love those albums to death. <br />   Let me tell you, I bought this album 3 days ago and at first listen I was very dissapointed. I really only liked \\"Speed of Sound\\" \\"Fix You\\" and \\"What If\\", These songs sounded much like there old stuff.I still love these songs, but these songs are really singles like \\"Yellow\\" and \\"In My Place\\". I have been listening to \\"X&Y\\" now for 3 days and about 3 hours a day and am loving it!!! I think I didn't like this album at first because it was so different from the first 2 albums. It sounded like a whole new band. I couldnt ask for anything better. I would have got sick of them if they made another album exactly the same. This album I would rate the same as there first two albums, but a very different style. <br />  This album still has a lot of piano work, but now you can here much electric guitar. The guitar sounds a lot like \\"The Edge\\" from U2. I keep reading articles that \\"Coldplay\\" says that there palagerizing. They may be inspired by these other artist, but I don't here any plagerizing.  <br />   I want to pick a favorite song, but I can't. I will tell you that I love every song on the album but \\"Till Kingdom Come\\". I just don't like the folk sounding music.
0743454537|4.0|I just completed this book, and had to wait until my eyes were no longer swollen shut(from crying), in order to write this review.  I am not the fastest reader in the world, but found myself unable to put this book down, finishing it in two days.  The story was intricately woven with every character's point of view, a fabulous effect.  I felt as though I knew these people.  In today's medical society, it is absolutely possible to concieve a child via Invitro Fertilzation, with a near perfect genetic match, in order to act as a donor for an ill family member...and this is where the dilemma lies in this incredible story.  What lengths would/should we go to, in order to save the life of a child?  Frankly, I don't know the answer, but I do know that I would try anything possible not to lose one of my children.  But, the ethical challenges posed by this novel (nonfiction, thank heavens--so far) is when do you stop asking the donor to continue?  Initially, the child was concieved, by unatural means, with the intent to only provide their older child, suffering from a rare form of leukemia, with the stem cells present in the cord blood at birth.  But, as the older child relapsed later, the younger sibling was called upon again to donate, and then again, and again, and again...where should the line have been drawn?  The parents were hopeful that the next donation would be curative, and that it would be the last...everytime.  I found myself feeling tortured myself, just thinking about maybe having to be faced with a similar scenario. <br /> <br />As for the ending, I was completely unprepared.  I found it hard to read, as my eyes were filled with tears.  This is a book that makes you think about it long after you've finished reading it.
B0002BO0AS|3.0|The members of Unearth are clearly skilled musicians. With Killswitch Engage axeman Adam Dutkiewicz behind the controls, you must know what the riffs sound like. Guitarists Ken Susi and Buz McGrath play riff after fiery riff, and at a speed that matches any modern metalcore band; but drummer Mike Justian is at the root of the attack. He bangs out deft drum beats and pummeling double bass patterns, which sound great alongside the guitars. Meanwhile, singer Trevor Phipps spills his guts and lets loose on every track. The end result is a very heartfelt, cathartic, and explosive sound; one that is fiercely heavy and almost always catchy.<br /><br />\\"The Great Dividers\\" opens with a pick slide and a heavy yell, then the guitars and drums hit fast and hard, back and forth. Stop-start guitar riffs occupy the middle, as does a fast double bass drum. Trevor sounds like Killswitch singer Howard Jones here, and the song ends with chugging riffs.<br />\\"This Lying World\\" is driven by another fast double bass. I enjoy how this one builds, then pauses and a yell of \\"Go!\\" ensues. This song also has more heavy chugging riffs.<br />\\"Zombie Autopilot\\" has a guitar solo, which is not the album's first, but is probably the best.<br />\\"Bloodlust...\\" has a crashing high-hat in between bobbing guitar riffs.<br />\\"Predetermined Sky\\" has booming opening riffs and some great drum work in the mid-section, and \\"False Idols\\" has more white hot riffs and two pick slides.<br /><br />So, Unearth have about all of the ingredients for a great metalcore band. Why then, you may ask, does \\"The Oncoming Storm\\" only get a three star rating? Well, every time I listen to this C.D., I think it is lacking something. I have come to realize that one crucial ingredient is missing. That one ingredient is innovation. I'm very surprised that I seem to be the only one who notices this is missing.<br /><br />Even though \\"The Oncoming Storm\\" is a mesh of Chimaira and Killswitch Engage with a dash of Atreyu, it is definitely most influenced by Chimaira (circa 2003). If Unearth had come before Chimaira, I would not be at all bored with this C.D. Unfortunately, the New Wave of American Heavy Metal scene is now bursting at the seams with bands that sound like this one. Everything on here--the heavy guitars, pummeling drums, screamed vocals, the melodic parts, and all around catchy sound--is very typical. Thus, Unearth barely stands out.<br /><br />Furthermore, every track essentially picks up where the last one left off, and every track is about the same length, so it is fairly hard to distinguish between them. \\"Aries,\\" a ballad with cool piano playing and non-dominating vocals, is one of the only tracks that breaks the mold.<br /><br />If you're a metalcore/New Wave of American Heavy Metal diehard, you should pick up \\"The Oncoming Storm.\\" Casual heavy metal and metalcore fans, however, could definitely afford to skip this one. Personally, I think \\"The Oncoming Storm\\" is full of good musicianship, but ultimately, it's nothing remarkable, memorable, or interesting. Sorry, I've just heard it too many times on other C.D.'s.a (circa 2003). If Unearth had come before Chimaira, I would not be at all bored with this C.D.

B000003TA4|1.0|The gall of some people...just because the man spent the last decade of his life in a drug induced stupor!  Who are they to pass judgement?  What's the big deal that he was out of his mind on drugs 90% of the time?  Does that make him a bad person?  What's the big deal that he gave himself a shotgun facelift?  I don't see anything wrong with that!  None of these things matter, because Kurt Cobain is a LEGEND!  A freaked out junkie of a lengend, but a musical legend none the less!  Those cheesy 80s hair bands like Led Zeppelin, Rush, and Dream Theater are nothing compared to the songwriting genius of Kurt Cobain.  You'd better be a master of your instrument to even attempt \\"In Bloom\\" \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" and \\"Come as You are\\"!  All these songs have THREE chords!  Eddie Van Halen, and all those cheesy 80s glam rockers couldn't even dream of pulling off such impossibly complex song structures!  Because as we all know, muddy, droning, distorted walls of guitar noise are the end all be all of music.  And the BRILLIANT lyrics!  Kurt Cobain's teenage angst was the only thing he ever sang about, which of course means he was brilliant!  Oh what a miserable existance Mr. Cobain lived--so miserable in fact, that he dried his tears with his millions of dollars!  And then stuck a bunch of filthy needles in his arm, trying too take away the pain of being a multi millionaire.  And when that didn't work, he took the cowards way out and gave himself a shotgun facelift.  Yes, Kurt lived a tragic existance--and his death is made even more tragic by the fact that the world never got to hear the other songs he could have written.  What mess of raging screams and droning, out of tune guitar noise would he have made if he lived?  Ahh, the world will never know what works of genius Kurt Cobain would have created if he were still alive.  But the few albums Nirvana did make were BRILLIANT--the greatest records of all time.  Nirvana were legendary musicians--kings among men!  The greatest band of all time!  SO what if Kurt was a drug addict?  So what if he blew his head off?  If you have a problem with an unstable dopehead who gave himself a shotgun facelift, than thats your problem.  That doesn't take away from Nirvana's legacy.  All hail to the grunge king of the 90s!  Nirvana---The Greatest Band in History!
B00000G6NK|5.0|On this legendary album, Reed celebrates Andy Warhol and his 15-minutes of fame stars in a glamrock style, influenced by David Bowie. This new edition includes two extra tracks, acoustic versions of Hanging Round and Perfect Day. The informative insert includes illustrations and an essay on the history of Reed and the significance of this album.<br /><br />Transformer is a type of decadent cabaret comparable to Bowie's Alladin Sane, but it is less bleak and much more colourful and engaging. Reed proved himself to be a master of many styles, from the compelling rock of Walk On The Wild Side through the tender and tuneful pop of Satellite Of Love to the oneiric Perfect Day, a haunting poetic excursion.<br /><br />Other highlights include the edgy rocker Vicious with its hypnotic melody and sarcastic/ironic lyrics (an attitude that would soon infuse punk and new wave), the quirky New York Telephone Conversation, the energetic Hanging Round and the stately Goodnight Ladies. The songs are highly descriptive of a time, a place and a mindset, and the music is powerful in places and very elegant.<br /><br />The stylistic variety renders Transformer compelling throughout while not detracting from the cohesion, making it a great piece of musical theatre. Devoted followers would agree that it does not reveal the complete Reed, as he has been so prolific and his oeuvre encompasses a much larger spectrum. But as a document of the middle seventies, it remains superb, an essential album for all serious rock fans.
B0001I55OC|2.0|I originally saw Timeline on DVD before I read the book. However after reading the book the DVD is not all that great. I recently watched the movie again, and was sorely disapointed. Michael Crichton's book was amazing. There were several details that could have been left out of the movie, however the movie could have been so much better if they chose to follow the book. Timeline is worth renting if you haven't seen it, but I would not go out and buy it. Although the one thing I enjoyed was the Scottish accents, those were awesome to listen to. If you really want a good story read the book instead of watching the movie.
B00080ZG10|5.0|Martin Scorsese's sweeping and epic portrait of Howard Hughes gives the legendary aviator and movie mogul the class and respect he deserves, beginning with the surprisingly perfect casting of Leonardo DiCaprio.  Those who believed DiCaprio was miscast in Scorsese's previous Gangs of New York will be marvelled as he gives the best performance of his career here.  Focusing on the most prolific period of Hughes' life, we see Hughes as the glamorous playboy and rich movie producer, but he is shown first and foremost as a brilliant aviator whose aeronautical advances bring both praise and ridicule.  John Logan's script is respectful, focusing on this period of Hughes' life and ending before his life took a final downward spiral, and the casting for the most part is superb.  Cate Blanchett shines in her Oscar winning role as Katherine Hepburn, while Kate Beckinsale is miscast as Ava Gardner.  The rest of the cast, including Oscar nominee Alan Alda, Alec Baldwin, and Di Caprio's fellow Gangs of New York alumni John C. Reilly, do teriffic work.  As a whole, the Aviator is a big budget Scorsese masterpiece that ranks up there with the director's other modern day classics, and like Hughes himself, DiCaprio and co. soar high.
B00AZ7V0W0|3.0|This collection is a great opportunity to own the original 7 movies in HD for a reasonable price. Buried in the two decades old interviews is a couple new bonuses which fans should enjoy. The new HD transfers aren't super crisp, but a definite upgrade over DVD.  I don't regret my purchase but I have to point out of few gripes and I'm not ready to get rid of my previous DVD collection just yet...<br /><br />-Recycled content: The first movie in the series gets much beter treatment than the rest of the series, but that's because of the fairly recent 2009 Infinifilm release. It's the only film in the set that features a new remaster, 7.1 surround, over 1.5 hours of featurettes (compared to less than 20 min for each of the other movies) and unique features like Focus Points and Interactive Trivia Track. It also features a slightly slicker menu and a new audio commentary track created for the stand-alone Blu-Ray release, culled from multiple interviews edited together. The single-disc releases of NOES 1 and NOES 2/3 available seperately are exactly the same as the discs in this set. If you haven't seen the Infinifilm DVD or the stand-alone Blu-Ray, the bonus features on this disc will be new to you.<br /><br />The original DVD collection was released in 1999 and movies 2-7 seem to have used the same video and audio masters rather than creating new ones as they did for the first movie. The HD video is not super crisp, but is serviceable and definite upgrade from the DVDs. The audio commentaries for parts 1 and 7 are also copied over from this release.<br /><br /> The original DVD collection had a bonus disc titled &#34;The Nightmare Series Encyclopedia&#34; that was split into three parts:<br />1.) Welcome to Prime Time - which is carried over to the bonus disc of this new set.<br />2.) Index - which is clips listed and seperated by movie are all copied over to their respective movie discs. There's also a Conclusions section of clips which was copied over to the new bonusdisc.<br />3.) Labyrinth - which is an interactive maze featuring puzzles and video clips including the clips previously mentioned, BUT about half of these clips are ONLY accessible via the Labyrinth and are NOT carried over to this new set.<br />The new bonus disc also curiously uses the main menu artwork from the original DVD disc. More blatant evidence of carrying over the features is the alternate ending listed seperately (it was previously the finale of the Welcome to Prime Time featurette). This alternate ending is on the NOES Disc 1 of the new set already only it's not as rough or in black and white like shown here...and the kicker is it ends with saying something like &#34;Search for ending 2 of 2 in the Labyrinth&#34; It's not even in this new set!<br /><br />Exclusive New Content:<br />-Fear Himself: The LIfe and Crimes of Freddy Krueger, a new half-hour long documentary<br />-2 Freddy's Nightmares Episodes - It's a Miserable Life and Killer Instinct (Episode 2 and 3). It's sad that the pilot episode is not included as it's all about Freddy's backstory. The rest of the episodes only feature Freddy briefly.<br /><br />Missing Features:<br />-3D ending to Freddy's Dead/3D Glasses<br />-The &#34;Labyrinth&#34; and the exclusive video clips hidden in it.<br />-Freddy vs. Jason<br />-NOES Reboot<br />-Booklet<br /><br />Artwork:<br />I have to say it...The cover artwork is god awful and uninspired. It doesn't even use the logo text from any of the movies. The menus are static and uninteresting but get the job done. Freddy has a slightly different look and makeup in each movie and when I see an image of Freddy from Part 2 on the menu for Part 5 it kinda irks me and there are several instances like this. Also the white house in the artwork for Part 2 is clearly NOT the Elm Street house.
B000000OAH|5.0|queen's 7th album is not quit as consistent as their first 6, but the album is still solid. the great songs include 'fat bottomed girls' and 'don't stop me now' also unknown gems like 'dreamers ball,' and 'let me entertain you.' jazz is a great listen.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I agree with the reviewer that says same Coldplay, but different album. The songwriting is brilliant and the musicality is superb. But it seems like some are penalizing Coldplay for progressing and not staying the same. The big mistake: going into the experience expecting to find a duplicate song from a previous record. Well, of course, that's going to yield a negative in some cases. But that doesn't make it bad. You really have to judge \\"X&Y\\" as \\"X&Y.\\" It has its own identity. You have to, as a listener, be willing to make a leap forward with the band. Otherwise, you might miss the boat. Coldplay did not disappoint with this album. Those who are disappointed have just failed in the idea of accepting something new. Coldplay succeeded. You just have to open your eyes and ears and look for it.
B000000OAA|5.0|this is a great album, 'killer queen,' 'brighton rock' and 'flick' of the wrist are some of the gems on this album. no filler to be found.
B000002H70|5.0|THIS CD IS ONE OF THE MOST MELODIC CDS THAT I HAVE EVER HEARD.  IT IS ONE OF THE GREATEST CD'S I'VE HEARD FROM THE CURE.  YOU COULD HEAR EVERY SONG AND NOT GET BORED.  GREAT CD!
B00005ATQD|5.0|A lot of reviewers appear not to be looking too deeply at \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" and that is a shame. <br /> <br />The thing I found most fascinating is the sinister element confronting the characters played by Tom and Nicole.  <br /> <br />Tom's character, Dr Harfod breaches the security of a secret group at what appears to be a regular gathering of elitists (Illuminati?) engaged in an occult ritualistic pagan orgy.  <br /> <br />Lots of symbolism. <br /> <br />Nightingale, the piano player - a messenger from the dark <br /> <br />Tom must go \\"over the Rainbow\\" (the shop) to get his costume. <br />   <br />The sinister element is what appears to be the secret world of the ultra-powerful elitists in control of the world.  Those who are largely behind the scenes and who utilize every imaginable trick and deception to exploit the masses.  <br /> <br />The misdirected publicity about the movie and the lightly publicized (at least in the US) cases of pedophile Alex Doutroux, The Franklin Cover-up, Bohemian Grove, and Skull and Bastards Society seem to be a parallels, that many may be vaguely aware of.   <br /> <br />Is there any wonder that Ebert didn't \\"get it\\" or that other mainstream \\"critics\\" didn't like it? <br /> <br />It goes without saying (for a Kubrick movie), I found Eyes Wide Shut, exceedingly well filmed and directed. Acting was also superb; even Cruise was good. <br /> <br />BTW, Kubrick died suddenly and never got to see the 'finished' product.  <br /> <br />Coincidence? Or was Kubrick punished for revealing too much?   <br /> <br />SD <br /> <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay is one of the best, and one their way to becoming one of the biggest, bands in the world.  X&Y is a totally solid, great album, giving Coldplay three stellar albums in a row.  That is no easy feat.   <br /> <br />Don't let the album sales make you a hater.  Its about time that great music - not just commercial, pointless, mindless crap - sold well.  I find that encouraging - not frustrating, that \\"everybody likes MY band.\\"
B0006L16N8|2.0|I've been a Coldplay fan ever since Parachutes. That's an amazing CD (their best so far) and A Rush of Blood to the Head was good, too (but not nearly as good as Parachutes).  <br />I had such high hopes for X & Y, and between my being a fan of the band and the overwhelming hype, it was hard not to be really psyched about this new CD. So, I bought it the day it came out, listened to it, and...was sorely disappointed. Maybe it will grow on me as I listen to it more, but I just really expected more from them.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay is one of today's few good bands. Sure, they're no Radiohead (circa 1997) or Oasis (circa '95-'96). But right now they're Britian's (and the rest of the world's) best band. 'Parachutes' was great, and so was 'A Rush of Blood to the Head'. How is 'X & Y'? <br /> <br /> By far the best album of 2005 (and this is coming from an Oasis fanatic), you must buy 'X & Y'. \\"Square One\\" gets it off to a great start. Other highlights are \\"White Shadows\\" and \\"Speed of Sound\\". I'm sorry I can't go into more into the album, but I got it an hour ago. I can tell you, however, to go get this and Oasis' new album, \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\". Brit Rock forever!
B0009K7ESW|5.0|This extaordinary 3 DVD set presents Yo-Yo Ma in six films inspired by J.S. Bach.  Along with T.Bando(Kabuki actor), J.M. Messervy (Garden designer), Mark Morris, (dance choreographer) J.Torvill & C. Dean (ice dancers), A. Egoyan and other film makers, Yo-Yo Ma explores the passion of Bach's solo Cello Suites.<br /><br />  Music Garden follows Ma and Garden Designer Messervy as they plan a Boston garden inspired by Bach. Sound of the Carceri shows Ma exploring with music, the prison etchings of the famous Italian architect, Piranesi.<br /><br />  In Struggle for Hope, Ma collaborates with Kabuki actor Banbo to blend Kabuki and Bach's Fifth Suite. Six Gestures features ice dancers Torvill and Dean and, of course, Bach and Yo-Yo Ma.<br /><br />  In Falling Down Stairs Mark Morris choreographs a dance based on Bach's Third Suite.  Sarabande, my favorite, displays Yo-Yo Ma at his best as he performs Bach's Fourth Suite.<br /><br />  This incredible collection of DVDs features the renowned cellist as he performs Bach in unique and innovative ways. I am reminded of G. Gould and his interpretation of Bach and am astounded how each injects his own philosophy and passion into these pieces.
B0009I7NOO|4.0|In 1995 there was nothing in the way of Oasis. \\"Definitely Maybe\\" had been released the year before, to great critical acclaim and sales. Fueled by rockers like \\"Live Forever\\" and \\"Supersonic\\", Oasis was heading to the top of the rock world. Later, in '95, they reached the summit with their landmark \\"(What's the Story) Morning Glory\\" album. Containing power ballads mega hits such as \\"Wonderwall\\" and \\"Champagne Supernova\\", \\"Morning Glory\\" became the second best selling album in the history of Britian (right behind THE greatest album ever, their idols' \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\"). <br /> <br />However, after \\"Morning Glory\\", Oasis seemed to fade away. \\"Be Here Now\\" was a huge setback for fans, and the band slowly moved away from mainstream audiences. Two more albums, \\"Standing on the Shoulders of Giants\\" and \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" were released relatively under the radar (compared to their earlier blockbuster albums). Now, a decade after their prime, Oasis is ready to return to the limelight. <br /> <br />\\"Don't Believe the Truth\\" is a good step in the right direction for Oasis. Many of the tracks are based around an acoustic guitar, minus rockers like \\"Mucky Fingers\\" and the catchy \\"Lyla\\". Everyone knows this isn't the most original band in the world. The song \\"Lyla\\" ,for example, starts off like the Stones' \\"Street Fighting Man\\", and builds into a Who-like song. After all, Zak Starkey (Son of Ringo) was taught by Keith Moon, so the drumming in many of the tracks sound like the Who. And as always, the Gallagher brothers input some of their mentors influnce, as you can hear Liam's Lennonesque sneering and Noel's songwriting is very reminscent of a Lennon/McCartney original. <br /> <br />Album highlights include \\"Turn Up the Sun\\",\\"Lyla\\", \\"Love Like A Bomb\\" and \\"Let There Be Love\\". The latter supposedly took over 5 years to create, and it sounds like it. Easily the best track on the album, \\"Let There Be Love\\" earns a top 10 spot in Oasis' song canon. In conclusion, go get this album. I am not going to say it's the next huge album or \\"Morning Glory\\" but it is pretty stellar. A great new breath into the otherwise dying (minus Coldplay) Britpop scene. <br /> <br />*The other review that has this same text was written by me. I forgot to sign in before submitting that review.Also, the person who said this album won't work with iPods is wrong. Mine worked fine. It is either his computer or he put the disc on the DVD side.* <br />*The DualDisc version includes all the songs in \\"enchanced\\" stereo, a 20 minute documentary on the album, and the music video for \\"Lyla\\". Where I bought my copy, the DualDisc was $1 more than the normal, so I bought the DualDisc. However, I would recommend the normal copy, since all the videos on the DualDisc can be found for free at Oasis' website.*
B0006L16N8|4.0|I love Coldplay. Amazing band live and great performers. This CD isn't their best of the three. That doesn't mean they're a bad band, just that Rush of Blood to the Head was a hard CD to follow. It always seems that the sophmore album blows everyone out of the water. When the third album follows everyone trashes it. It happens so often it makes me ill. X&Y will remain in my CD player next to Parachutes and Rush of Blood. They're a great band, can't wait till they come back to town.
B000002UAU|5.0|Most likely someone is reading this just to see how much others love the album they love. You know how these album changed The Beatles, rock music, music in general, the hippie culture, America, the U.K., and eventually the world. You know all the songs on here. You know they're are at least 13 reason to get this (Sgt.Peppers,A Little Help,Lucy in the Sky, Getting Better, Fixing A Hole, She's Leaving Home,Being for the Benefit, Within You, 64, Rita, Good Morning, The Reprise, and A Day In The Life.) This has been out for almost 30 years. And if you haven't listened to this, for the sake of humanity, experience the world's most important 40 minutes.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|Waking the Fallen is what I consider a nearly perfect album. Easily in my top 10 of all time. The music is amazing and the vocals are flawless - perfect screaming, growls (or whatever you want to call them), and great singing. What's best is when he's in-between an all-out scream and singing...Ya know what I mean? Anyway, I wasn't worried at all after I heard that Shadows couldn't scream anymore (from his surgery), because I really like his singing voice on WTF. I thought he would just sing like in the chorus of Chapter Four, and happiness would ensue. But on City of Evil, I don't know what the hell he's trying to do. Yes, the surgery took away his scream, but it had NOTHING to do with his new singing style. You can tell it's intentional. On WTF, his singing voice is very powerful and mature. Now he sounds very...whiny and nasaly. He also tries to hit different ranges that he simply CANNOT hit. It's downright awkward. I DARE YOU not to cringe at most of the vocals on this album...I DARE YOU. The vocals nearly ruin this record, hands down. The thing is, the music is pretty damn good. It's the only reason I gave the album 3 stars instead of 2. In fact, give me this album with his singing from WTF, and I know it would be very enjoyable.
B000002OVJ|5.0|Yeah, that's right. Don't give me any Allman \\"Live at Fillmore East\\". This is THE live album to own. Opening with a superb Entwistle-penned rocker, \\"Heaven and Hell\\", the rock never ends. Truly one of the Ox's underrated songs, \\"Heaven and Hell\\" warms up the Who for their best concert ever. It segues into the standard opener, \\"I Can't Explain\\", which has never sounded better. Pete Townshend throws in a couple solos, proving he's more than just a rhythm guitarist. The album moves through more great tunes, with highlights like \\"A Quick One,While He's Away\\" and \\"Amazing Journey\\". Finally, the band reaches their mod anthem, \\"My Generation\\". Entwistle's bass solos are incredible. This is the reason he is constantly hailed as the greatest bassist, ever. The normally 3 minute song streches out to well over 15 minutes, with some \\"We're Not Going to Take It\\" and \\"The Seeker\\" thrown into the jam. The show ends with the crowd pleaser of \\"Magic Bus\\". Are you confused after reading this? Good, now go get this!
B0006L16N8|5.0|Don't know if it as good as Starfish by the Church, but, pretty close. Time will tell. (Dash of U2 & Radiohead too.) If it was my third album, I'd be proud.  They're the daddies :)
0783226063|2.0|In 2004, I finally read Dune. Awesome story and I plan to read it again someday. Movies often fail to meet up to the book they are based upon and this is no exception, in my opinion. Maybe I am mesmerized by all the amazing special effects in movies these days, but I actually laughed much through this movie. I realize the story is complicated and long, but the 1984 version just doesn't cut it. I would LOVE to see a remake of this, not so much for updated special effects (the worms were great in the 1984 version) but for a more engaging storyline. Like LOTR, one is going to appreciate the movie much more if they've read the book, but LOTR followed the books quite well, IMO, AND they came out with movies that awed even non-book-readers. I think DUNE could be like that.
0790729628|5.0|Blade Runner is one of the best two or three films of the scifi genre.  It is listed in some compilations as one of top 100 greatest films of all time.  The role of this film in the scifi oeuvre is similar to that of Tom Sawyer in American literature - it has set the tone for all films in the genre since - that the future will have nicer toys but everything else - including us - will be just as dirty, gritty, and grimy as the present. <br /> <br />This film does have some flaws.  Sean Young (Rachel) is the vision of beauty that she needs to be, but frankly her acting  abilities are embarassing.  Some of the scenes are almost too  hokey to watch.  Harrison Ford is merely adequate, but that's all he needs to be.  At least he wasn't as bad as he was in Star Wars. <br /> <br />Despite the flaws, viewing this film in full surround sound with a large letter-box screen is an amazing experience.  The haunting soundtrack by Vangelis is a masterpiece - this film would be something completely different without it. <br /> <br />It's a pity the producers had to cut Deckard's unicorn dream sequence from the original release.  They did, of course, for obvious commercial reasons.  However, the film loses a potentially vital clue without it - is it coincidence, or does  Gaff's origami unicorn reveal that he knows what's in Deckard's dreams, just as Deckard knew Rachel's?  We are left to wonder if Deckard is himself a replicant or a human - I would say the film intentionally leaves that question up to us. <br /> <br />Violence in film nowadays is almost universally depicted in a gratuitous, cartoonish manner which renders it meaningless except as a plot device or an excuse for special effects.  In contrast, the nightmarish violence depicted in Blade Runner is used to good effect to reflect the essential brutality of life itself. <br /> <br />Ultimately, I think at its highest level Blade Runner is a movie about life lived in the shadow of the awareness of mortality.  Throughout the film, eyes are used to symbolize the quest for self-knowledge as symbolized through the varying degrees of lightness, darkness, and pain.  Almost the entire film is shot in a polluted, rainy darkness, signifying the state of Deckard's soul, with the only glimpses of blue sky evident at the top of the Tyrell Corporation headquarters (where Deckard first meets Rachel), at the moment of Roy's death, and (in the theatrical release) when Deckard escapes with Rachel. <br /> <br />The sequence between the death of Pris and the death of Roy is perhaps the most inspired piece of film-making I have ever seen.  The deeply symbolic nature of the final chase, with the fear of death (in the form of Roy Batty) forcing Deckard to the pinnacle of knowledge and self-awareness atop the Bradbury building, is  beautiful (religiophobes will have to excuse the crucifixion symbology).  Great stuff.
B000063DHK|5.0|\\"Live After Death,\\" for any lover of heavy metal, is a necessity, along with live recordings such as Ozzy's \\"Tribute\\" and Zeppelin's BBC recordings. This is where the spandex 80s metal reached its high-point for British rock/metal. The album is wonderfully mixed and recorded. The remastered version is a step up from the original as well, and the songs are even spliced in different places for the remaster (the older cut did not include Bruce Dickinson's chatter before each song but rather at the back end of the previous song; also, on the older version, Churchill's speech was lumped in with \\"Aces High\\" but now it's a separate track). On the older versions, one only received the tracks up until \\"Running Free,\\" but the double-CD remaster is faithful to the old vinyl and cassette versions of the album which include the final 5 tracks or so. Some reviewers are upset about Dickinson's ability to sing the older Di'Anno songs, but I wound up hearing this album before the old Di'Anno albums and frankly I like Bruce's vocals a bit more. Di'Anno sounds almost like a punk rock singer than he does a metal singer. <br /> <br />All in all, this set is necessary for any lover of metal. Maiden fans all across the board rave this album with little to no variation. Enjoy!
B0007P3582|5.0|this cd is the best cd 50 cent made but the best songs are candy shop,disco inferno,just a little bit,and piggy bank this cd is worth it and you cant argue with the prices. this cd is big pimpin
B000063DI9|4.0|Like a lot of other reviewers, I see this album as the last of Iron Maiden's efforts until \\"Brave New World\\" hit the racks in 2000. The time between these two albums could be considered \\"12 Wasted Years,\\" in my opinion (pun intended). This was the last album which featured Adrian Smith, Maiden's most capable guitarist. I saw the band live in 1990 with the \\"No Prayer for the Dying\\" tour and was very, very disappointed with all of the glam-rock type songs on the newer album, the loss of a great guitarist, and their inability to play songs that were written by or heavily featured Adrian. <br /> <br />With that said, I will say that this CD is a great companion to \\"Somewhere in Time.\\" Both albums are laced with keyboard/synth textures which I feel adds to the overall scope of the albums. This is also Maiden's first full-blown concept album (I don't believe \\"Somewhere in Time\\" qualifies, but it does come close). They pull it off quite well, although some fans seem preoccupied with the biblical overtones of the album, much like on \\"Number of the Beast.\\" The themes are mostly pulled from the book of Revelation, and some have even theorized that the album is a mild take-off of Orson Scott Card's book \\"Seventh Son.\\" Some of the correlations between the book and the album are indeed uncanny (esp. \\"Infinite Dreams\\" and \\"The Clairvoyant\\") but most other attempted connections are stretchy at best. <br /> <br />The album rocks; the trademark \\"clinky\\" bass guitaring of Steve Harris is ubiquitous, as are the rhythm guitar galloping that became trademark back on \\"Piece of Mind\\" and \\"Powerslave\\" (and perfected on \\"Somewhere in Time\\" -- see \\"Loneliness of the Long Distance Runner\\"). The lyrics are indeed dark and tamper with Christianity to some extent, but they're not as bad as what other metal bands are capable of doing (at no point does Maiden slander Christianity or its God). <br /> <br />Again, this is Maiden's high-point, in my mind, and a necessary album if you're into the band. For those looking to break into the band, this should probably come after \\"Somewhere in Time\\" or \\"Live After Death.\\"
B0009OPO0S|5.0|If you already think that you want this album, I highly recommend getting the \\"Dualdisk\\" version - there aren't a whole lot of extras on the DVD side but what's there is definately worth it.  First of all, there's a great feature where you can read the lyrics in Spanish or English along with the entire album.  If your Spanish is a little rusty (like mine) this is a big help in figuring out exactly what she's singing about.  Also, there's an interview by Sanz that's very intimate and shows Shakira's vulnerable side.
B0000029GA|5.0|As cliche as it is to say, you need this album in your collection if you are a fan of hip-hop. This is a masterpiece. Production and mic skills are flawless. One for the ages. And as tough as it is to follow-up a debut of this magnitude, I think he does a damn good job with \\"It Was Written\\". <br /> <br />Personal favorites are probably the album cuts: \\"Represent\\", \\"One Time For Your Mind\\", and \\"Memory Lane\\". Also, seek out Large Professor's \\"It Ain't Hard To Tell (Remix)\\" [not on this album].
B00097A5I6|3.0|After hearing Oasis drudge through the last couple of albums, I was starting to think they needed to start taking drugs again and beg the original line-up to rejoin the band.  Then when I heard about their aborted sessions with Death in Vegas, I was annoyed because it meant they'd yet again be producing their own recordings instead of doing something completely new and unexpected.  The new album is not a glowing offerring, but it is by far more interesting than the last three Oasis albums.  The First song, Turn Up The Sun, is indication enough that the band is headed in the right direction.  I know Andy Bell wrote it (not a traditional Gallagher composition), but, man, what a GREAT song.  I hope Andy can continue to write good songs and keep the Hurricane #1 influnces OUT of the band (though I wouldn't mind some Ride influence).  Lyla, also a strong track, as are Mucky Fingers, Love Like A Bomb and Let There Be Love.  My acid test for any good album is if it contains 4 to 5 good songs.  This Oasis album delivers a good, solid rock effort.  Will it make my top 10 list for the year?  Probably not. It will, however,  be played really loud as I speed down the highway.  I only hope Oasis get their butts in gear and put their next album out in a shorter timeframe than three years so they can capitalize on this momentum.  Thanks Lads!  With each Oasis album I have said:  \\"If this Oasis album is average, I'm not buying the next one.\\"  Each album has had enough good material to keep me coming back for more, but this album is a marked improvement from the rest.
B0006L16N8|3.0|I've only owned 'X and Y' for a couple of days, and have already surmised that it's nowhere near the tower that is A Rush Of Blood... The most immediate SHOCK that struck me upon first listens was just how predictable the chords, and vocals were. If you know anything about music at all, you'll soon be writing these songs, as you listen. I guess we've just heard them all before. Another (slightly worrying) factor is just how much the band are starting to sound like U2. I don't know if it's because someone has told them that this may be a good thing, or is purely coincidental, but one cannot help but associate the two together.  <br />I guess it was going to be a really tricky job in trying to top AROBTTH, but they could have just tried a little harder than this. <br />Far, far too many five stars for this around here I'm afraid.
B0009I7NNA|2.0|I was a huge fan of Avenged 7X last album, Waking the Fallen, and I have to say, this is nowhere near it.  WTF absolutely jams from start to Finish, and MShadows voice is bad ass on the entire record.  I understand he had surgery on his throat, and that really sucks for him and his band, but he just CANNOT perform the way he used to.  It's too bad, too, because this band has serious talent and the music is very strong on this record.  I completely agree with the reviewer before me on the fact that his voice will make you absolutely CRINGE on City of Evil.  He doesn't even sing the same way, and his voice completely changes the way this band sounds.  After about 2 listens to it, I threw it in the back seat of my ride and put WTF back in my player.  Don't waste your money on this record if you loved the last one (especially his screaming, there is none on this one), just be glad they were able to put out such a masterpiece as WTF before it all fell apart.  Fred Dursts Numb One Fann is a jackass and don't listen to one thing that B-Rad G imitator has to say....
B00007LTIB|5.0|Make no mistake, this is Steve Howe's showcase.  From the liner notes you learn that the entire album was pretty much mapped out before Moraz even plugged in.  With that in mind Patrick does an outstanding job.  The age of \\"fusion\\" was well under way when they made this and the influence from groups like Return to Forever and Mahavishnu Orchestra are evident.  \\"Gates\\" is noisy and violent at times but remember that it is a recreation of a battlefield in all its terror.  \\"Sound Chaser\\" is an adventure in tempo changes and surprises and works well.  \\"To be Over\\" is magnificent with its counterpoint melodies that Yes was known for.  It is one of their finer moments.  The extra tracks are interesting.  \\"Soon\\" works as a single but whoever thought \\"Chaser\\" could be fashioned into top 40 material was nuts.  The studio run-thru for \\"Gates\\" is for fans only.  It's like watching a behind-the-scenes feature for a movie in that the raw creative process is exposed in its naked form.  Sound-wise I can only compare it to my bad pressing on vinyl that I suffered with for 30 years.  It is music to my ears.
0767903862|5.0|This book was recommended to me by a family member who shares my sense of wonder with the world and also shares my sense of humor.  <br /> <br />He recommended Mr. Bryson's books to me, and I feel like a kid who just discovered a new and grandiose candy store! I picked this book first since I have always been fascinated with Australia and do plan on visiting someday. Reading this book, I felt like I traveled there with Mr. Bryson and saw Australia with with him as my travel companion. You actually experience the country, and a the same time you have a lot of fun. The humor in this book, my kind of humor, had me laughing so hard with teary eyes that my kids are sure I need to be committed.  <br /> <br />Bill Bryson has the ability to put together a travel book that reads like a novel with enough humor to tickle anyone's funny bone. Because it reads like an interesting story, you retain what you have read and understand it all with much greater clarity than a text driven, simple and dry travel book.  Now I know I want to visit Australia. Too bad he couldn't go with me to keep me laughing along the way! <br /> <br />I will be reading all of his books. This wanna-be traveler is looking forward to each and every one! What a delightful way to take a virtual vacation. <br /> <br />I found this book absolutely delightful as well as insightful. Thank you Bill Bryson!
B0006L16N8|4.0|X&Y is very good, yet a disappointment compared to Coldplays earlier music.  Speed of Sound is really the only decent track.  If you like Coldplay (good Coldplay) you are sure to enjoy the new album from Oasis, Don't Believe the Truth.  I can't get Keep the Dream Alive out of my head.  Hope some of you enjoy this new Colplay cd.  Otherwise, pick up the new Oasis cd.  It's the number one cd worldwide right now.  Cheers.
B00000I01A|5.0|This album just rocks from start to finish.  A total 80's masterpiece of rock, synth and drama - my only regret is that it took me 18 years to actually by it.  Doh!! <br /> <br />There is hardly a bad song on the album, which makes for a really enjoyable listening experience from start to finish.  I really loved the instrumentals by Vince Di Cola 'War' and 'Training Montage' - sheer brilliance. <br /> <br />If you are a lover of this sort of music, and of the 80's in general then BUY THIS NOW!!
B0006L16N8|5.0|The best of 2005 has officially arrived with Coldplay's \\"X&Y.\\" If you love great music, then this is a must for any collection. The album starts out with the bold and soaring \\"Square One\\". It just makes you feel like you're flying. Then it segues to one of the most beautiful ballads ever written \\"What If.\\" There are so many different facets of Coldplay explored on this album, it's better just to listen than attempt to explain them all. It's an obvious departure from AROBTTH, not completely. But like math, it's all cumulative. One builds on the other. \\"X&Y\\" is merely another chapter or one is algebra while the other calculus. <br /> <br />I find \\"X&Y\\" to be more advanced and more complex than its predecessor. It soars to new heights that only AROBTTH could have dreamed of. \\"White Shadows\\" is an obvious standout in this collection with its 80's Techno flavor. And \\"Twisted Logic\\" is the perfect closer sans the bonus track. There are so many good parts that it's hard just to pick one. The band really comes together as a whole on this album.  <br /> <br />If you only buy one album this year, then \\"X&Y\\" would be the perfect choice. <br />
B0009A1AS2|5.0|People dont get it. This album as well as all there other albums are one of a kind. They are different and unique and should be celebrated when they do hit the shelves. They are like Green Carnation, unto which ALL there albums are different and DO NOT sound the same. I applaud DT on there new release and doing a good job on it. So what if they aren't grabbing the audience with radio hits, the best bands aren't on the radio (and yes i am aware of As I Am on the radio). So take from them what you want and celebrate it or hate it. But all i have to say is. If no one else can please you.....then who can?
B00005JO8T|5.0|Very nice, thoughtful review by the way wannabefilmcritic. <br /> <br />A terrific film: my only qualm was it could have been 5-10 minutes shorter. That's all. <br />I thought I saw the Best Film of the Year last week when I witnessed LAYER CAKE. But, still, being #2 isn't so bad.
B0002858YS|5.0|The Killers are an amazing group and this album is awesome! My favourite tracks are Mr. Brightside and Andy, You're a Star. If you like music such as Franz Ferdinand (which is also great) then you'll also like The Killers. They've got an amazing energy to their music that makes you want to jump around and sing along. It's loud but not noisy and too hard. Very catchy.
B00005JMYI|2.0|Being in the broadcasting business, I can identify with most of the routines that goes on in the newsroom from this movie.  On an entertainment level, this film had the potential of being very funny.  It was very spotty as far as laughs.  However, the script comes off prety lame.  The acting was pretty obnixious and made it seem like I was going through a root canal at the dentist office.  Unfortunately, you'll be disappointed if you're expecting lots of laughs.  It could have been a much better film!
B0007GAERG|5.0|I was always a huge fan of Mariah Carey - big enough to buy her Glitter album. Unfortunately for all of us that was a real let down. Mariah Carey disappeared for a while but with Emancipation of Mimi she is having a great comeback. Her first single, We Should Be Together, is a great track and goes back to what she is good at. There isn't a trashy, trying to be young, getting skanky feel to this album. There are still some hip hop tracks with Jermaine Dupri, Nelly, Snoop Dogg, Pharrell, etc. but they are good (especially It's Like That). Some of my favourite tracks are also: One & Only, Shake It Off and Fly Like a Bird.
0451526384|5.0|In my opinion, Persuasion is probably Heyer's most underrated book.  Most people read Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibilty and Emma, but Persuasion doesn't get nearly as much attention, which is very sad as I think it's probably Austen's best-written novel.  Perhaps people don't read it because it's about an \\"older\\" hero and heroine, and the heroine is not beautiful, nor is she very spunky or spirited.  The story also develops in a much more subtle way than some of Austen's others.  Whatever the reason for its lack of popularity, however, it definitely deserves a wider following.    Not only is it the most romantic of Austen's books(in my opinion), but it also has the greatest characters!  They're funny, silly, stupid, and manipulative- and therefore, completely memorable.  And the hero and heroine are just the sort one wants to cheer for, and see settled happily.  I admit that P&P, S&S and Emma are fun reads, and they'll always have a huge following.  Persuasion won't ever reach that level of fandom, but it's definitely on my favorites list and deserves a reading.
0156027321|4.0|I saw tons and tons of people reading this book on the subway every day so I decided to go out and buy it. It really was a great book and worth reading. Yann Martel writes about an adventure one boy has by himself on a boat with a slew of animals. It's an amazing journey and the ending is absolutely wonderful. The only thing is I didn't get the feeling of absolute genius or the feeling that I had to keep on reading. However, it is a very interesting book and definitely worth reading.
0141439513|5.0|Austen, Jane. Pride and Prejudice. New York: The New American Library Inc., 1961. 332 pages.<br /><br />Pride and Prejudice is the story of The Bennet family. With three lovely daughters, it is Mrs. Bennet's wish that they get married to successful men, although her husband Mr. Bennet thinks differently. With this we are introduced to Jane Bennet, the eldest of the three Bennet girls. She is the ideal daughter who thinks nothing terrible about anyone and who falls in love at first sight with a business tycoon. Then we have Lydia, who is a foolish girl, similar to her mother. She does no work, and goes around looking at all the troops who pass by their city and flirts with them. There she meets a young officer who she falls in \\"love\\" and elopes with. And last we have Elizabeth Bennet. She is the youngest and the brightest out of all three. She has both sense and beauty, although she is not as beautiful as her eldest sister Jane. Elizabeth is very loving and is especially close to Jane. Although at times she can be loud and rude, Elizabeth is never afraid to speak about what's on her mind. And then Elizabeth meets Mr. Darcy. Mr. Darcy is a very blunt and rude man according to Elizabeth, and the two just can't seem to get along with each other. Mr. Darcy however slowly starts to fall for Elizabeth and tries to woo her indirectly. Pride and Prejudice is a wonderful heart warming story about a journey of love. This book is recommended for anyone who likes to read a good romantic seventeenth century novel.
B00006879E|2.0|Maroon 5 hit it big with their song This Love, which I admit, was a catchy tune and I did like it and sing along. However, their album is not very solid. They've got tracks that just seem really plain and like filler tracks. The other single which was Sunday Morning is a nice song. But their other single She Will Be Loved gets on my nerves. The lead singer has a high nasaly voice but it didn't bother me in some of the songs. But in that song and some others it does. So I can't really listen to this album for more than one rotation for example so it ends up sitting there in the corner. If you like She Will Be Loved (assuming you've heard it on the radio or something) then the album should be fine but for those that don't really enjoy his voice all that much this album isn't strong.
B000002LCI|5.0|Actually this was the album that started me as a Depeche Mode fan and one of the first albums that I bought.  There are some really classics Depeche Mode songs on this album, like:  \\"Never let me down again\\"  \\"Strange love\\" and   \\"Behind the wheel\\".
B00009V7P8|4.0|I first heard his music in the movie Closer and I assume many people also first heard Damien Rice there. I was intrigued by the song in the movie (Blower's Daughter) and went to check out his album. There are quite a few really nice tracks here such as Volcano and Cannonball (great two guitar track). Those two are his most \\"normal sounding\\", shall we say, songs. The other ones are pretty interesting and different sounding. This is a album worth checking out - he's a talented guy and has a different style.
B000001IPL|4.0|<br />Why the hell do people rate songs individually as sh*t like 15/10 and 11.98/5? Goddamn, people are trying to decide what to purchase. Nobody cares if you think that \\"cussing just makes [\\"Bad Habit\\"] hilarious\\". The songs are great overall, and the vocals are audible this time around. They're no longer buried beneath layers of other instruments like the band's previous two albums. I personally prefer Ignition, but that's just me. The radio hits \\"Come Out & Play\\" and \\"Self-Esteem\\" are included here, as well as the title song \\"Smash\\" that didn't end up as a single for some reason. Buy this album if you like Hard Rock. This ain't Punk, and neither is their debut or Ignition. These albums are too intelligent to be labled as Punk. Although, anything after Ixnay is bad news. Unfortunately, the band sounds like Blink 182 nowadays, but at least we still have decent albums like Smash.  <br />
B0006L16N8|4.0|I am a huge Coldplay fan and listened to their first album over and over again. It was one of those CDs for me that never got old and something that you could just listen to for a long time. X&Y is a good next album with some great tracks such as their single, Speed of Sound (their best song of the CD). It's a great album but I don't feel like it is as good or better than the first. If you like the first one, you will definitely still like this one - the style is the same. Just don't expect something to blow you away.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|This is a film that is a Master of all it does. Every scene is so carefully calculated and so astoundingly executed. The cast is captivating! It took me some time to realize that Russell Crowe was not remotely like John Nash in real life - he completely embodies the role, convincing you with every gesture, every glance. Jennifer Connelly starts off slowly, but suddenly snaps to life as a woman that demands your attention and respect. Paul Bettany excels in his role - he is immediately likable and twists your emotions as you find him to be \\"the enemy\\". While all the actors are at their best, they carry the movie along subtlety, letting the enthralling story take center stage. Ron Howard's superb directing makes the first viewing an instantly powerful experience, but has many fine details than can only be picked out from numerous viewings. For instance, the subtlety of the hallucinations. When the little girl is running through the grass and around a flock of pigeons, none of the birds move or are startled by her frolicking in close proximity. Watching closely, you will find many moments such as these, which can still be quite chilling on the 3rd or 4th viewing. The character of Nash is, of course, the central point of the movie and he is a deeply pitiable and complex character. His imaginary friends fulfil what you see to be his deepest needs - Charles, the friend who always listens and cares(\\"somebody needed a hug\\") and Parcher, the ego boosting agent who makes Nash a \\"somebody\\"(\\"You are simply the best natural code breaker I've ever seen\\"). Even when you find out that they're merely characters in his mind, you long to believe him and slowly let the film lure you back into considering if he could possibly be right. When Alicia finds the shed and you hear the radio inside, you find yourself hoping against hope that she'll open the door to discover her husband's secret service agents working away to find the bomb. His journey from loneliness to love, from recognition to accomplishment, from brilliance to insanity and back is depicted in a powerful and memorable way.  Beautifully begun, beautifully unraveled and beautifully concluded... this is truly a Beautiful movie.to accomplishment, from brilliance to insanity and back is depicted in a powerful and memorable way.  Beautifully begun, beautifully unraveled and beautifully concluded... this is truly a Beautiful movie.
B000002J09|2.0|How could people seriously think that this is Zeppelin's best work. This doesn't even compare to the work they did on Presence, or Coda. Hell, even In Through The Out Door was better than this. In fact, their first 4 albums are all kinda lame, and lack the intensity compared to their latter days. Stairway To Heaven is a \\"ok\\" song, so I'll give it two stars for that. But it certainly isn't worth 3 stars, let alone five.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|I have to say that \\"The Machinist\\" is easily the most unsettling, disturbing and bizarre film I have seen so far this year.  I mean, you can tell from reading the back of the DVD cover and seeing how disturbingly thin Christian Bale in pictures from the movie that this is not going to be a very happy time.  Yet, last night I was in the mood for something dark and uncompromising.  I got it and then some with this cleverly haunting film that is unforgettable.<br /><br />Bale plays \\"Trevor Reznik,\\" a troubled and fatigued machinist who hasn't slept for a year.  He lives his life in isolation, with the few minor exceptions such as a friendly prostitute who takes a liking to him and an airport coffee shop waitress he visits every night.  Things take a turn for the worst when he meets a fellow machinist for the first time... but nobody knows who this guy is.  They tell Trevor that he doesn't exist.  The paranoia and confusion leads to a horrific accident on the job that involves his co-worker.  And that's when he gets the strange notes in his apartment.  Either Trevor is completely delusional and has lost his mind... or somebody really is out to get him.<br /><br />What's really intriguing about the movie is that just like Trevor, we do not know exactly what is real or what is made up.  There are times when we're doubtful of what we're seeing, and then we get roped in and second-guess ourselves.  The movie is a non-stop dread fest that just speaks of loneliness and paranoia, and that's why it works.  It looks and feels exactly like it should.  From the very first few minutes, it's easy to realize that this is going to be one unsettling and dark experience.  It is one that you may want to re-watch after you see it all.  You'll definitely think about it for a while after it's all said and done, but personally I didn't think it was that hard to piece together after it was over.  It made sense, and it made even more sense on the second viewing.  Christian Bale is fantastic in this.  I can't believe he dropped down to around 100 pounds for the role.  Yes, you should be warned that Bale looks EXTREMELY skinny in this... almost like a walking skeleton, as was intended in the script.  I think the movie was very well written and directed.<br /><br />This isn't a movie for those who get easily disturbed or freaked out.  It's a pretty uneasy movie to watch.  Let's just say you won't feel extremely cheerful after you get done watching this.  You may want to put on something funny after you're done, otherwise you're going to have this movie stuck in your head while you try to sleep.  The DVD has a little to offer in the extra features department, such as commentary from the director, a making of feature, 8 deleted scenes and the theatrical trailer.<br /><br />I really enjoyed \\"The Machinist.\\"  It surprised me and kept me hooked from beginning to end.  I have to say that I kind of missed watching dark movies like this.  Seems like there's too many \\"cutesy-wutesy\\" movies for the family, so it's good to see something so brutal, so raw and so in your face like this.  If you want to be disturbed and see something that isn't your typical thriller, \\"The Machinist\\" is something to put down on your list of movies to see.  As depressing and dreadful as this movie can get... I'm ready to see it again. -Michael Cranec in this.  I can't believe he dropped down to around 100 pounds for the role.

B00080ZG10|4.0|THE AVIATOR is Martin Scorsese's and Leonardo DiCaprio's absolutely gorgeous period piece highlighting the peak of eccentric billionaire Howard Hughes' life through the late 1920s into the late 1940s.<br /><br />Scorsese truly needs to reevaluate his filmmaking. While uniformly well-made, his recent films seem to lack direct relevance to the audience. Still, having purged themselves of the excesses of THE GANGS OF NEW YORK, Scorsese and DiCaprio do a masterful job of capturing the ambience and decadence of Hollywood's golden era. Given the egomaniacal narcissists with whom Hughes was surrounded, it's little wonder he later became a recluse. DiCaprio doesn't resemble the rough-hewn Hughes at all (despite the addition of shoe-polish black hair and a pencil-thin moustache), nor is he powerful enough as an actor to carry the role well, but he does touch the essence of the man.<br /><br />Hughes was a man who never did anything in a small way: In keeping with his obsessive-compulsive nature, he spent millions on what others considered mere details. His World War One flying epic HELL'S ANGELS was the longest, most complex, most expensive film shot circa 1930 (and was totally redone in the middle when Hughes decided to make it a talkie). He quested for aviation speed records (and acquired them by dint of his insistence upon having flush rivets in the fuselage of his plane, a first). He loved some of Hollywood's most amazing women (among them Katharine Hepburn and Ava Gardner). He designed a cleavage-enhancing wonder bra for Jane Russell to wear in his western THE OUTLAW (when he was told that the film would never make it past the censors, he responded rather incredulously, \\"Who doesn't like %!%$?\\"). He designed the world's largest flying boat, the behemoth-like Hercules (aka the Spruce Goose) totally out of wood (it flew once, and is now a museum display). Hughes also owned Trans-World Airlines and invented the pressurized cabin and hydraulic controls. In short, anyone who's ever been an airline passenger owes it to Howard Hughes.<br /><br />While DiCaprio doesn't bring all this to the fore (some of it is in the extras in the two CD set, along with much information on Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder), he does show us that, as the price for his brilliance, Hughes was a man who suffered the usual clamor of daily life in intense pain. The pop of flashbulbs, the crunch of broken glass, and the asymmetrical disorder of green peas on a dinner plate were enough to drive Hughes into a frenzy. In colloquial terms he was as crazy as a bedbug. Clinically, he suffered from OCD. Hughes had an irrational fear particularly of contamination. Because of this mental illness, Hughes descended into an isolated darkness where he handwashed till he bled, and lived in a masking-tape bordered world which represented his own fantasy-driven germ-free zone. In the end he lived in a Las Vegas suite with tinted windows and saw no one.<br /><br />Impressive supporting performances are given by Cate Blanchett (as a surprisingly pompous Katharine Hepburn), Kate Beckinsale (who gained twenty pounds to play the voluptuous Ava Gardner), Alec Baldwin (as Pan Am founder Juan Trippe, Hughes' chief business rival, with whom he maintained a cordial hatred), and Alan Alda (as Senator Owen Brewster). Brewster was all but owned by Trippe, and was later the ax-man for Tail Gunner Joe McCarthy. As a trenchant comment on latter-day political trends, Alda's Brewster is a pure special-interests hack, trying to drive Hughes out of business against Trippe with some specious charges of war profiteering. Hughes battles back manfully: \\"Free junkets down to Peru, Mr. Senator from Maine? They must be buying a lot of lobsters in Lima this year, I guess.\\"<br /><br />A fine film but not a great film. THE AVIATOR definitely keeps you involved. Well worth the time.airline passenger owes it to Howard Hughes.

B00009MGQL|5.0|I wholeheartedly disagree with the last reviewer.  Tape loops will be seen as some cheesy idea that people thought was \\"new\\"; same way we look at disco. <br /> <br />Blow by blow is still his best, and so good it will never be dated, the rhodes sound still can't be beat for sheer groove, AND REAL LIVE MUSICIANS WILL ALWAYS BE BETTER. <br /> <br />Having said that, the guitar here is refreshingly pure and creative, and CLEAN.
B0006L16N8|3.0|Although nowhere near as good as the previous albums or b-sides, X&Y is getting serious airtime during my morning commute. Let me state here that I really dig the Coldplay sound and will listen to just about anything they release. However, it took several plays to get into this album and, as stated in many other reviews, it is lacking the track or two that simply rock. You won't find a \\"Clocks\\" or \\"Yellow\\" on this album. I'm going to go middle of the road with the star count. Wasn't thrilled but wasn't as disappointed as with some of the other \\"highly anticipated\\" releases of this year. <br /> <br />Bottom line: If you really dig Coldplay, you'll enjoy the album. If you can take or leave them, you're better off passing.
B000002KBU|5.0|After first hearing songs like \\"Big Yellow Taxi\\", \\"Free Man In Paris\\", and \\"Help Me\\", I loved Joni Mitchell as a listener. After then hearing this album, \\"Blue\\", I fell in love with Joni Mitchell as a musician. I have heard many different types of music played by all different kinds of artists and never have I heard such an amazing piece of work. I envy how Joni can release her deepest emotions to words and then transfer them to such spectacular chords and melodies. She is one of my biggest musical influences and \\"Blue\\" has become the album I could not live without. I sat down recently and tried to think of my favorite song off the album, but I couldn't. Each one seems to have a mind of its own and they each go off into different realms of musical genius. As a writer, her words seem to soar off the page and into the deepest part of you. \\"I could drink a case of you and still be on my feet.\\" This album overflows with words that seem so simple yet are so profound. The emotions that a person feels in his or her life are expressed more exquisitely by Joni than any other lyricist--setting Bob Dylan apart, of course. You will not regret buying this album, nor any other Joni album at that. Every genre she experiments with works. Every album and every song she has released is completely wonderful. But if you want to start at the top, buy \\"Blue.\\"
B0002S94OS|5.0|I love Lamb of God they are proablaly my fav band rite now.  This cd is what got me into LoG and, after listening to ther other to cds, New American Gospel and As the Palaces Burn, is LoG's best.  Dont get me wrong, the other cds rock to, but this one just kicks so much ass!  The first song, Laid to Rest is the best song on the album along with Hourglass and Omerta.  Buy this CD!
0790729628|5.0|This is a surprisingly controversial dvd. To me, the excellence of the original movie is reason enough to love it. Even if the plot and characters don't arouse identification at first, retrospection shows that the movie holds its own weight and then some, and has a lot to say about some important issues. Visually, Scott is so good, that a crackle or bit of static here or there did not upset me at all. So what can I say-- this is a great movie that people should collect-- it does not need extras or different versions. It stands on its own.

B00007G1ZM|4.0|Mildred Pierce, the film directed by Michael Curtis, is approximately 109 minutes long and brought to the big screen in 1945.  This is a story of a very strong willed woman named Mildred Pierce, played very well by Joan Crawford, who decides that she no longer needs her husband to raise her two daughters.  She and her husband Bert Pierce (Bruce Bennet) soon separate and Mildred gets a job as a waitress to give her two daughters the things she thinks they need.  Mildred's oldest daughter is Veda (Ann Blyth) is a very sadistic and spoiled brat.  Mildred keeps the fact that she is a waitress a secret from Veda so that she does not think less of her.  Veda's younger sister dies suddenly from pneumonia and Mildred's goal in life is to make her oldest daughter Veda love her.  Mildred learns the restaurant business through working as a waitress and soon gets the confidence, and a little financial help from her husband's former business partner Wally (Jack Carson), to start a restaurant of her own.  After a few years of hard work her restaurant is a success and she opens several restaurants called Mildred's.  After the chain of restaurants become successful Mildred meets a higher-class ladies man named Monty (Zachary Scott) and thinks she might be in love with him.  Monty seems to spend a lot of time with young Veda and shows her the ropes of how upper class citizens live.  Veda still is not satisfied due to the fact that her mother works for her money and cannot live the independently wealthy lifestyle that Veda longs for.  As the movie plays out you will see how very spoiled and conniving young Veda is.  She finally drives Mildred to the point of kicking her out even though Veda is the only thing she had worked for all of her life.  There is a surprising twist ending that will probably surprise most viewers and you will see the main characters get what they deserve.  I give this film a four out of five stars due to the excellent story and the actors that the director picked for each part seemed perfect.  The only poor part of the movie was the speed of the dialogue and the manner in which the actors did not seem natural.  I guess along with better special effects we have also evolved with our acting skills.
B0000DJZB9|5.0|...a few complaints. This is a direct copy of the VHS tape and there is no remastered audio or video. (5.1 surround and a less grainy image would have been nice.) There are no special features, although is anyone really surprised that the band didn't get together for a commentary? <br /> <br />If you don't have the VHS tape this is a good thing to get, regardless of its mediocre quality. It's better than watching them on MTV, no? The interactive menus are better than I expected, anyway. At least some thought was put into it. <br /> <br />The videos themselves? Ace stuff, even if the Use Your Illusion videos got a bit pretentious. And although I love Estranged, the video represents GN'R at their most commercial. <br /> <br />WELCOME TO THE JUNGLE -- GN'R at their most hair metal, this video is raw and loud; awesome stuff. Jim Carrey spoofed it in the fifth Dirty Harry film, \\"THE DEAD POOL.\\" <br /> <br />SWEET CHILD O' MINE - My favorite GN'R song and video, if only because it was my first. Axl's dancing is cool. <br /> <br />PARADISE CITY -- Great song, but I've never cared much for the video. Goes on a bit too long with the same stuff. <br /> <br />DON'T CRY -- Good video. A bit too much though. <br /> <br />NOVEMBER RAIN -- Their second best. <br /> <br />ESTRANGED -- Brilliant song, very good video, just a bit too \\"clean\\" and un-GN'R'ish at times. <br /> <br />THE GARDEN -- The only music video where they aren't shown performing the song. A seedy trip through Sin City, so to speak. <br /> <br />GARDEN OF EDEN -- Loud, silly fun - I love it. <br /> <br />DEAD HORSE -- Very cool, Axl plays guitar. <br /> <br />LIVE AND LET DIE -- Another UYI music video. I wish they'd made more Appetite ones, but this is still good. <br /> <br />SINCE I DON'T HAVE YOU -- The worst GN'R video. Gary Oldman plays Misery, and it's an embarrassing ordeal. It almost ruins the song, which is great. <br /> <br />If you're a fan of GN'R you should get this collection because it's a must-own,simple enough. The only two videos it doesn't feature are You Could Be Mine (from the T2 soundtrack) and the X-rated It's So Easy (which featured S&M stuff and was banned or something). I downloaded those two off Limewire, You Could Be Mine is absolutely awesome. Hopefully once the legal issues are settled in the future (if ever?) they'll be included on a new re-issue of the DVD. Perhaps by then the ex-bandmembers will have all made up and we'll be treated to a commentary. But oh hell, who am I kidding? We have a better chance of a Chinese Democracy. (Ha, I'm so clever.)
B0002IU988|5.0|I bought this CD the day it came out and am still listening it to this day. It is without a doubt my personal favorite CD. Every single song is amazing. I was a true Creed fan, but I think that Myles has an even better voice than Stapp. Anyone who rates this CD with less than 5 stars can't tell good music from a wet fart.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Dream Theater's OCTAVARIUM is another recording that has continued the long string of controversy that really started by their 2002 album SIX DEGREES OF INNER TURBULENCE. Each DT album has a different style, and it seems that they have a broad fanbase to match. So when each CD comes out, a large group of people love the album, but the rest hate it saying its their worst album. TRAIN OF THOUGHT had the heavy metal camp cheering and applauding Dream Theater, while this album again has controversy, with the same heavy metal crowd critcizing the \\"popish\\" ballads and mellow sections. It makes me ill that if Dream Theater makes a metal album, they are criticized for \\"wanking\\", and if they make a restrained, lighter, more atmospheric album, they get criticized for being boring!!! <br /> <br />I think that with OCTAVARIUM, however, that Dream Theater has come together to make some of their best music since Kevin Moore left the band after 1994's AWAKE.They have heavier tracks like \\"The Root of All Evil\\" and \\"Panic Attack\\" that show their aggressive, metal side. More commercial songs like \\"The Answer Lies Within\\" and \\"I Walk Beside You\\" are anchored on catchy choruses, simple but beautiful melodies, and restrained/effective playing by all members of the band. Songs like \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" and \\"These Walls\\" that are classic Dream Theater songs that display what they are known for: powerful songwriting combined with incredible playing. \\"Never Enough\\" apparently has a huge Muse influence and while I love the track I hope that it isn't plagarism on their part... <br /> <br />Then we have the EPIC Octavarium, a 24-minute track that brings something new to the band. The first few minutes are atmospheric synth and Jordan Rudess playing on his new Haaken Continuum, a dynamic fingerboard that he uses to play some crazy guitar samples. A fuzzy Continuum melody ushers in the distorted guitars before they fade away to a flute solo, and the use of this and the orchestra at the end marks something new for the band as well. Another highlight is steel acoustic (or lap guitar?!) that is used in the first verse/chorus of this song, and up to the 12 minute mark they build up the music with some great vocals by LaBrie and overall amazing chord progressions, including a wonderful groove/solo by bassist John Myung. At the 12 minute mark, it launches into prog instrumental madness with a blistering Moog solo by Jordan Rudess, one of the best things I've heard from him in all his years with the band. The vocal part keeps building up the song with some great call and response vocals; following this is a great instrumental section that evokes memories of the instrumental sections of Metropolis and The Dance of Eternity! The climax at around the 20 minute mark had James LaBrie screaming \\"Trapped inside this Octavarium\\" at the top of his lungs...with great distorted guitar which fades away to the Orchestra, which leads the band for the next for minutes, including an amazing 2 minute guitar solo by John Petrucci, which makes me wonder why people are criticizing his lack of soloing! <br /> <br />I could go into that kind of detail for every song, because I love each one, but I wanted to go into detail on the title track to show you the top-notch songwriting and what new, innovative things are coming out of the band. I think that people should be OPEN-MINDED about their music, and if there is a more commercial/pop sounding song it should be ok, you're allowed to like short catchy songs...and I think that DT has executed and written them in a way that no radio band ever could, with some great chord progressions and orchestration. If you enjoy a wide palette of music styles, a more atmospheric/restrained side to virtuoustic music, and love music that probes into your soul you should definately get OCTAVARIUM!
B0007Z4S4C|5.0|After listening to my 1st listen to 'Mighty ReArranger' I was blown away by it. I have purchased every Post-Zep Plant album & this is the best so far.  <br /> <br />There is probably no chance of Robert ever playing again with Jimmy or John Paul but if he continues to release albums as powerful as this in the future there is no loss there.  <br /> <br />I hope we don't have to wait another 12 years for another solo release of original tracks.
B000002LCX|5.0|To me Strangeways is the most cohesive Smiths album. Perhaps that is because it is the shortest, clocking in at a little over 30 minutes. This my favorite group of all time and Strangeways is my favorite Smiths album. I can't say whether or not it is their best because each Smiths album showcases a different hue of Smithsdom. I don't understand why some reviewers think that \\"Death of a Disco Dancer\\" is a bad song. I think it is absolutely brilliant. Morrissey is as wry as ever, seeming somewhat weary. The music grows and grows into a frenzy thanks to some odd pianer' playing from Moz and some great drumming from Mike Joyce at the song's climax. Every other song, with the exception of the somewhat listenable \\"Death at One's Elbow,\\" is terrific. If you don't know much about the Smiths, I advise you-no, I command you to check them out. They are one of the few bands in history that can be truly life-changing.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is the kind of album that almost anyone could enjoy. You really don't have to be a fan of one particular genre or another. This CD has mass appeal. It's just all about good music and when that it the case it just tends to win over more people.    \\"X&Y\\" is powerful, yet gentle on the ears. It's Rock music that truly sooths the soul with deep , rich, and lush sounds that are distinctively Coldplay. At times, it is incredibly cinematic. The melodies weave in and out of your mind with grand arrangements. Once you listen to \\"X&Y,\\" it tough to get it out of your head.    The first song \\"Square One\\" sets the tone for this masterpiece and never lets go. The energy from then on is infectious. Coldplay continues to find a way to make great music while appealing to a wide audience. For this, they deserve high praise.
B000929AJQ|5.0|It took six years, but it's everything one could want and more. <br /> <br />In all that time, Trent Reznor underwent an emotional and musical transformation.  Though this marks the end of the style that produced Pretty Hate Machine and The Downward Spiral, the new NIN is more developed, more focused, and more impressive.  This 56 minute masterpiece contains more variety than any other NIN album.  Some of the tracks are brash and aggressive (You Know What You Are?, Getting Smaller).  Some are passive and melodic (All the Love in the World, Right Where it Belongs).  And others are unique firsts that NIN has never done before (Only, The Line Begins to Blur).  In the end, this proves to be the most satisfying album in NIN's history.  This album's impressive run at #1 in sales is an accurate reflection of its quality.  This is one of the best rock albums of 2005 and certainly the best in the industrial genre.
B0006L16N8|4.0|\\"The truth is.... I miss you.\\"  That lyric in \\"Warning Sign\\" made me realize Chris Martin was special, and it began my relationship with Coldplay.  \\"The Scientist\\" broke my heart, \\"Trouble\\" freed me from guilt, \\"Spies\\" made me feel cool, \\"Rush of Blood to the Head\\" made me shiver with anger....   On X&Y, sadly, Chris doesn't even seem to glance my way.  He seems like a figurehead, preaching to the masses.  I'm afraid he may have lost his mojo. <br /> <br />The volume on the other guys is louder on this album.  Don't get me wrong, I adore the other guys too, but turning them up draws attention to the fact that, in spite of their glorious music, they're not the best musicians on Earth. <br /> <br />There's another feature of this album that keeps distracting me.  I can't keep from hearing bits of other artists embedded in these creations, like a seek-and-find: <br /> <br />Song 3. in \\"White Shadows\\" is hidden the chorus from Midnight Oil's \\"Beds are Burning\\" <br /> <br />Song 4. in the middle of \\"Fix You\\" Johnny Ramone pops in for a guitar solo <br /> <br />Song 6. in \\"X&Y\\" can you catch \\"Mole From the Ministry\\" by The Dukes of Stratosphear (XTC)? <br /> <br />Song 13. in \\"Till Kingdom Come\\" lurks \\"On the Turning Away\\" by Pink Floyd <br /> <br />Chris, if you're reading this, I miss you.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|While AWAKE was a right-in-your-face bomb with more processed sounds (drums with lots of reverb, etc) this Octavarium sounds a tad more organic. Train of Thought was also a heavier album if compared to this one. I give four starts and not five just because of a lack of punch -- not on the sound itself -- but on the songs. <br /> <br />The sound quality is really good, although I think the snare drum is too loud, probably a consequence of Portnoy breathing on the mixing engineer's neck. Voice and snare drum combination isn't good on this album. One is far away (voice) and the other is too loud (snare drum) and yes, I am a recording engineer and a hi-end audio equipment whore. <br /> <br />It's evident on this album that the age of its members is showing up. I don't think a band like DT needs to create songs that talk about how \\"life is short\\" and all that. Come on fellas you're still very young and kicking! <br /> <br />A good album nonetheless, worth having in your collection. DT fans won't be as happy as non-fans though.
B000066NW0|4.0|I first got this CD a short while after it had been released and soon found that many of the songs were easy to listen to. I found I could listen to the same songs over and over and still not get tired of them, and for this reason Avril Lavigne is my favorite artist.  <br /> <br />Contrary to some CD's where many of the songs are just there to fill up space, I've found that every song has thought and emotion put into it, and although the simplicity of the lyrics at times can make you wince, you will soon forget about it as the song will quickly carry you past it. <br /> <br />It is true, though, that the songs are very simple and for that I give it 4 stars. What I love most and I'm sure that many who listen to her will too is the deep, richness of her voice.  <br />I'll never tire of it.

B00001OH7N|5.0|The Man who sold the World is the latest Bowie Album I have listened to, I have been playing station to station over and over and have decided to give this a go.  <br /> <br />A lot of people who have reviewed this album have complained about the production, I can't fault the production, its top notch, considering it was 1970?? <br /> <br />All the songs blend well into each other, in fact from The Man who sold the World to Diamond Dogs, there is very little variation in the styles. Bowie knew when to close the tap on Glam rock Starting off with \\"1984\\" from Diamond Dogs evolving in to a Full blown up version of the release of Young America. <br /> <br />The only track that should have been replaced on The Man who sold the world is \\"the Superman\\" by its Demo version which featured on either Hunky Dory or Ziggy stardust. The track feels overproduced on The Man who sold the world whereas the Demo to me is a superior recording. <br /> <br />David Bowie is a Rare RARE genius, There is a huge Catalogue of Music to choose from, But 70's David Bowie packs more in than most acts of his era ever will. <br /> <br />Ignore the other reviews if you haven't heard this Album, just go and get it, you will not be Disappointed. <br />

B000059HB7|5.0|In any listing of movies that have stood the test of time, surely Howard Hawks' \\"Rio Bravo\\" is up there among them. Generally underappreciated as just a \\"popcorn picture\\" or \\"routine Wayne vehicle\\" by the so-called perceptive reviewers of the period, \\"Bravo\\" was anything BUT that...and has proved such again and again over the years. In truth, \\"Rio Bravo\\" is a gem of a western...and a gem of a MOVIE. Period . <br />    <br />   The genesis of this film lies in \\"High Noon\\", a film which people such as Duke Wayne, Howard Hawks, John Ford, and even writer Louis L'Amour disliked (though not Gary Cooper's performance IN it). L'Amour cited the fact that these townsmen of the old west were by and large Civil War veterans. They had faced mini-balls,cannon balls,black powder explosions,flying shrapnel, cold-steel cavalry charges, bayonet charges, and more in places like Chickamaugua, <br />Shiloh, Petersburg, Gettysburgh, and Cold Harbor. A look at the movie \\"Gettysburg\\" would show you what kind of people these were. <br />These are the kind of people who lived in Northfield, Minnesota, when the James-Younger gang came to raid there. Did they run and hide and leave everything on the shoulders of the local law? Not a bit of it. They turned out in force and shot Jesse and Frank's bunch to pieces...and sent the survivors packing. Same kind of people lived in Coffeyville, Kansas, when the infamous Dalton Gang tried the same thing there. Result? There WASN'T a Dalton Gang anymore when the gunsmoke cleared. <br /> <br />  These were the kind of \\"take your best shot\\" people who REALLY <br />comprised the citizenry of an Old West Town. <br /> <br />   And this is what shows in \\"Rio Bravo\\". This is a warm movie, full of very REAL people...not the cardboard cowards of \\"High Noon\\". These people are stalwart and resolute. They know what their situation is and they know they have to face it the best way they can.  <br /> <br />   And they do. <br /> <br />   The cast is marvelous. DukeWayne is just plain Duke Wayne; <br />stoic, shrewd, gruff but kind-hearted, bearish but sentimental.Just the way John Wayne is SUPPOSED to be! <br />Dean Martin is awesome as Dude, the drunken ex-deputy struggling to get himself \\"off the sauce\\" and redeemed in his own eyes and those of his friends. It has been said that that this is one of Dino's finest performances and I agree. Absolutely. Martin should indeed have gotten an oscar for this.  <br /> <br />   Comedy here comes from three sources: Walter Brennan as \\"Stumpy\\", the town jailer (carrying his \\"Amos McCoy\\" tv persona...and his trademark cackle... to iheir full potential),Wayne's awkward \\"courtship ritual\\" (even if he doesn't realize it) with Angie Dickinson; and Jose Gonzales-Gonzales's performance as as Carlos, the hotel owner, delivering spot-on hilarity in vignettes involving...or related to...his young & fiesty wife. <br /> <br />   Dickinson is superb as \\"Feathers\\", a good-hearted gambling gal with a questionable past and her heart set on snagging Wayne's \\"John T. Chance\\" ( I carried a crush on Dickinson for YEARS coming out of this movie)and Ricky Nelson does a wholly acceptable turn as \\"Colorado Ryan\\", a young fast gun trying to do the right thing. Nelson and Martin do a duet of \\"My Rifle, My Pony, and Me\\" in a jailhouse sequence that works well. It also raises memories in viewers because the instrumental version of that same song wends its way all through the earlier Hawks-Wayne \\"Red River\\". Another song, the old traditional folk number \\"Cindy\\", becomes a trio piece as Walter Brennan joins in for it. <br /> <br />  The baddies in this movie are mainly Claude Akins as \\"Joe Burdette\\", a swaggering bully, and John Russell, as Joe's brother <br />\\"Nathan\\". Russell would be on Wayne's side of the badge for the tv series \\"Lawman\\", and later would portray the evil killer-marshal-for-hire gunned down at the end of \\"Pale Rider\\" by Clint Eastwood's \\"Preacher\\" character. Familiar1940s/50s \\"B\\" western and tvwestern character actor Myron Healy shows up in a bar scene taunting Dean Martin's \\"Dude\\" with a coin in a spittoon, and comes to regret it. And the great Ward Bond shows up as old Wayne friend , freighter \\"Pat Wheeler\\", for a time in this film, oddly enough wearing the EXACT SAME clothes/Costume he wore as \\"Major Seth Adams\\" on his own tv show, \\"Wagon Train\\" . <br /> <br />  This is a great movie, full of menace and compassion, comedy and tension,romance and suspense, action and acting. A well realized production WELL worth watching. Made by Howard Hawks, but so close to John Ford as to be uncanny. <br /> <br />   \\"Rio Bravo\\"? It's a WINNER. <br />
B0000C8AQM|5.0|WOW! That's all I have to say.  This is most likely the best soundtrack i have on my shelf right now.  I just bought it a few days ago but i cant keep it out of my cd player!  I think it was a good idea to put some of the sound clips from the movie on to the cd because they add a sense of humor to the cd which most soundtracks don't have.  I've told most of my friends how great it is and plan to tell more!
B000002J03|5.0|The negative reviews I've read about this album are just plain stunning. <br />The first group seems to focus on Led Zeppelin's \\"unoriginality\\", particularly in regard to their plagiarization of American blues artists.  Now, as someone that has actually LISTENED to Robert Johnson, Willie Dixon, et al, the case doesn't hold much water.  Certainly, lyrics were ripped off, but their SOUND was completely original.  It's as if people don't give them credit for their originality because they can't imagine a time before the archetype existed: the somewhat effeminate long-haired singer, the mysterious long-haired guitarist, the calm/collected long-haired bassist (noticing a trend here?), the bashing madman on drums.  This format simply did not exist before Led Zeppelin.  \\"Bring It On Home\\" sounds like an often-missed pre-emptive strike against detractors... as if to say in the first minute or so \\"This is what the blues sound like\\" and in the rest \\"Here is a completely different style of music loosely based around similar scales.\\"  Who else at the time was alternating between gentle acoustics/clean electrics and hard rock (\\"Ramble On\\", \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\")?  Who else was bowing guitars, using theremins, panning bizzarre noises from side to side, experimenting with forward and backward reverb... all on the SAME SONG (\\"Whole Lotta Love\\")? <br />Another thing to take into account: half of this band was barely into their 20's, they had JUST put an album out a few months previously, and they wrote and recorded this WHILE ON TOUR.  If you listen to the nuances in the songs, it's amazing just how much improvisation is going on.  The famous unaccompanied Heartbreaker solo?  Improvised.  Most of the Lemon Song?  Improvised.  Bonham's drum solo?  Improvised.   <br />And we can't forget the individual performances.   <br />Plant may not have been old enough to legally drink in the USA, but he could certainly croon and wail with the best of them.  His range and dynamics are strong enough for the material.   <br />One could write a book about Page's performance on this album... while Hendrix invented many of the techniques, it seemed as if he was more interested in using them as experimentation, while Page actually used the different techniques to sculpt a soundscape.  Harmonized feedback.  Call and response panning.  Backwards echo with slide.  Remember, the concept of guitar distortion was only a few years old at this point.   <br />Bonham's drumwork is incredible, but not only in regards to his raw power.  Listen closely to the hi-hat nuances in \\"Heartbreaker\\".  The tom rolls in \\"The Lemon Song\\".  His effortless switches between delicacy and bombast on \\"What Is And What Should Never Be\\". <br />Last but not least, John Paul Jones.  His playing on \\"The Lemon Song\\" is simply phenomenal.  Yes, those are distorted power chords on bass on \\"Heartbreaker\\".  He's all over the place on this one, and his nimble yet powerful low end is as defining of this album's essence as Page's riffs. <br />People who take points off for the production on this album should be ashamed.  This record was recorded THIRTY-SIX YEARS AGO.  It serves as the blue-print for hard rock and heavy metal, and for historical significance alone it gets 5 stars.  <br /> <br />Saying Led Zeppelin were a bad rock band is like saying that Thomas Edison was a bad electrician.
6305558167|5.0|My daughter says that watching this movie is like watching a dream.  It's diffcult for me to express how truly amazing this movie is.  When one considers the legends extend back 1500 years and have been told by the Celts, the Breton poets, and countless wandering bards all over Europe it becomes apparent that there is no one \\"Arthurian\\" tale.  In 1135 Geoffrey of Monmouth, an Englishman, wrote his version of Arthur in Latin.  It was later translated into French and then English.  In the 1160s Chretien de Troyes, a Frenchman, wrote his poems about Arthur and his knights.  These accounts are significantly different.  The version most people are familiar with is Sir Thomas Malory's \\"Morte D'Arthur\\" which was written in English. <br /> <br />     Add in all the other minor versions that were mixed in coming from all over Europe and you get an editor's nightmare when it comes to weaving a single coherent tale that can incorporate most of the main story points.  The way John Boorman has done this is quite frankly an extraordinary achievement. <br /> <br />     Now when you add in the superb acting, magnificent cinematography and the passionate music of Wagner you get an epic that can inspire one to wonder and yearn for a life filled with the quest for something greater than oneself. <br /> <br />    I reccomend watching this movie.  All other movies about Arthur are pale compared to \\"Excalibur\\". Some like \\"True Knight\\" and the most recent \\"Arthur\\" are ludicrous.  <br /> <br />     There are some who don't like this movie.  They can't help what they feel.  You have to feel sorry for them.
B000003C2U|5.0|Spiritual Healing was a good album.Having said that,Death's fourth album Human is light years ahead of Spiritual Healing and Leprosy lyrically and technically.Human is what got me to love Death,and  show me that there was more to metal than generic satanism.Though Death isn't my favorite band,Human is one of my favorite metal albums owing largely to its focused drumwork,dynamic guitar and intelligent lyrical content.Songs like Lack  Of Comprehension and the beautifully prog flavored Cosmic Sea offer up a depth of not only technicality but also emotion.Human expanded my musical and intellectual horizons and showed me that metal could indeed endeavor to be more than escapist fantasy.For fans of this subculture,prog rock or hardcore devotees,there's always something ripe for the picking in this masterpiece.Thank you Chuck for the inspiration and emotion.I'll never forget what you gave to me.
B00097DX3U|4.0|Great CD. Buy it if you want some nice new tunes for yourself. Also, that dude below me has WAY TOO MUCH TIME ON THEIR HANDS. Get a life dude.
B00003CX95|5.0|This has to be one of my most favorite movie of all time.  If you want to read a longer more in depth review there are plenty to choose from here but simply put this is one of the best told epic films ever made.  If you dont feel genuin compasion for the hero then you are a robot.  Wonderful story that could be told any better.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|Let me state that I am a fan of most of Ryan Adams work from Whiskeytown through all his solo stuff.  My only complaint is that sometimes I feel he writes so much that a lot of it comes out to be mediocre (however, mediocre RA is better than a lot of music out there).  The double disc Cold Roses truly brings back what I originally liked about Ryan Adams.  Disk 1 includes more songs reminiscent of the Whiskeytown style.  More of the rock is on disk 1.  Disk 2 is a bit mellow.  I'd say both disks combined remind me of Whiskeytown/Love is Hell/Heartbreaker.  The Cardinals as the backing band provide excellent musicianship.  Hightlight song for me is Meadowlake Street.  It provides such a drawn out quiet low dynamic intro and just evolves into a beauty of a song.  No throwaways on either disc for me.
0596009208|5.0|I've been studying java for almost a year.  I have a background in procedual languages like COBOL, but am relatively new to object oriented programming. I had worked my way through a couple of other Java books, but I didn't really 'get' OOP until I read this book. <br /> <br />The examples are clear and the illustrations effectively teach the concepts.  The code examples are short enough that you don't have to wade through pages of code to find the one new thing being taught, and long enough to teach the concept.   <br /> <br />I'd reccommend this book to anyone who wants to learn java.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Folks, it's not even a contest. Coldplay is the best band of their generation. With \\"X&Y,\\" they've taken strides by leaps and bounds. They won the race this time. While their peers are trailing behind and breaking every bone in their back to catch up, Coldplay makes it look effortless. I would really urge young and older people to get this album. This is the only way we're going to preserve great music. If you don't support it, then you can't complain. Coldplay did something great. People should check it out.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|It seems many of the worst reviews were written by the same person. Fake reviews are usually done to improve the rating by someone that could benefit from higher sales. Between bad reviews from people with an axe to grind and those promoting their own crappy movie, these reviews have become useless.
B0002858YS|3.0|This album is okay, but to me it seems every song is a rip-off of something else. The production on this disc isn't too good either, with some tracks (Andy, You're A Star) sounding fuzzy and distorted. Brandon Flowers' faux British accent gets annoying, too.<br /><br />Smile Like You Mean It is a great song, however.
B0009F2C34|5.0|Rating: A+ <br />While many bands and artists strive for utter perfection, fitting into the mainstream, or just plain and simple making one song on an album that becomes a chart topper that helps sell millions of copies of an album, DJ Shadow takes the laid back path letting his albums build steam like a grain of salt, and pick up followers along the way, as each album invites even the most astray and wary listener to delve into the magic and pure bliss that his audial landscapes permeate. By all means and shapes, this is one of the greatest albums released in the 90's, if not all time, due not only to the fact that Shadow basically took sampling, made it a science, showed everyone what they could really do with this artform, and then let his work speak for itself, the work of a true artist. From the beginning of the album, to its bittersweet conclusion, we are granted a brief trip through the imagination and mini-movies that Josh Davis has commited to record, as each track stands on its own two feet and each song blends together so well that you would think this was his fifth or forth album, just because of the overall production and clarity that each track permeates. The deluxe edition only strengthens this already A+ album, with a great introduction from the upcoming 33 1/3 book coming out in August which is dedicated to this highly regarded and fantastic album. In addition Shadow comments on each track on the second disc giving us brief insight into te demoes, and preproduction attempts at the earlier versions of the songs on the album. This is Shadows best album in my honest opinion, although truly you have to get all of his masterpieces to truly appreciate his ever evolving style of music, whether The Private Press, PreEmptive Strike, Endtroducing, or Unkle is concerned, all are classics in their own right. Listen to this album in the depths of your darkest room and let your imagination wander, I dare you to say that this is not a classic album in the truest sense, those that don't know about Shadow will never know what they are missing out on; too bad for them.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|First. The Review. After that, the scam revealed.<br /><br />I have given Octavarium 4 full listens. It's hard to explain this album. It's not awful, it's not great, it's not \\"Six Degrees of Inner Slop.\\" It just `is'. I can't put my finger on it. It's like a mix between Images and Words and Falling into Infinity but without the magic of the former and the `umph' of the latter. There is not a single jaw-dropping moment on the album - though I'm not sure that's a bad thing in general. In other words, not once did I get goosebumps from a part that just made me go \\"holy crap!!\\" Yet it's a fairly pleasant listen. There are some decent, catchy tunes on it. It's kind of like Floyd. Nothing in Floyd's catalog is jaw dropping and yet their albums are stellar (not that this album is stellar! Not even close.). But because there are none of these jaw dropping moments on Octavarium, which DT needs in order to remain interesting, I'm afraid this album will probably become a boring listen rather quickly and not revisit the CD player after a few more listens. The mix on the album is ok. It's good to not hear that Kevin Shirley garbage that has plagued them for the last 5 albums. But the drums are buried and the mix overall is a little muddy for my tastes. The guitars are WAY understated, though there is a great Journey sounding solo on one of the earlier tunes, and the keys have finally been brought forward again after being non-existent for 4 albums. Labrie sounds good as usual but again, nothing extraordinary. And Portnoy may finally NOT win the Modern Drummer reader's poll after winning 9 straight years because he doesn't flex a whole lot. Yes, there are certainly those `Portnoy moments', but generally he just plays for the song. Normally, that's great! But with DT, we've come to expect a certain level of virtuosity that is just not on this album. With Train of Thought and other DT albums, I knew those albums would grow on me because there was so much to digest. And they did grow on me as I really love those prior albums (except for SDOIT). But after one listen of Octavarium, I didn't find myself saying, \\"Wow, so much to digest.\\" It was easily swallowed, digested, and passed through my bowels.<br /><br />...Now onto the scam...<br /><br />I am of the mind that DT is truly spreading themselves too thin with all the side projects and too many of their good ideas are being filtered through 15 different bands. If they would just stick with DT and put ALL their effort there, I think each new album would be a masterpiece. But why is that not happening? It's simple. Dream Theater purely exists now so the band can make money on the DT name (thanks to 'fans' like us who keep buying their records) and earn a living, while playing and writing the music they TRULY want to play and write with other musicians in other projects. It's really that simple. A DT album comes out, it sells a million copies worldwide, they make a decent chunk of change on sales, merchandise, tours, and clinics, and then they go and play with other guys because that's where their hearts lie now.<br /><br />Like it or not, this could very well be the last DT album (or maybe we'll see one more) because I think fans are starting to catch on to this shameless scam.<br /><br />Shame on you Dream Theater for bilking your fans. Shame on us for falling for it album after album.<br /><br />Feel free to email me :)row on me as I really love those prior albums (except for SDOIT).

B0007Y4TVU|1.0|These guys are a sorry excuse for a metal band. The popularity of them alone says the days of good metal(Soulfly, Sepultura, Slayer, etc) are quickly coming to an end and we begin the age of bubble-gum rock. I can sing in the shower (and have) better than the \\"singer\\" of this group. \\"Fingernails on chalkboard\\" would have been a more appropriate name for these guys. BYOB is the song getting the most radio play, AND IT'S TERRIBLE!! Beer, Bombs, whatever the B stands for, really stands for ZERO! These guys are WAY to late to ride the idealic coatails of Rage against the machine. A sub-par band for sub-par times...
B00097A5I6|4.0|With their sixth album, Oasis return to what made them popular in the first place--catchy melodies, rocking guitars and stomping drums. Not since 1995's \\"What's The Story Morning Glory\\" has Oasis sounded this good. Perhaps the Gallagher brothers have finally set aside their petty issues and poured their energies into their music. While not near perfect as \\"Morning Glory\\", \\"Don't Believe The Truth\\" is almost as consistent with a trio of power rockers leading off the album in the form of opener \\"Turn Up The Sun\\" followed by the pounding beats of \\"Mucky Fingers\\" and then the lilting stomp of first single \\"Lyla\\". \\"The Importance Of Being Idle\\" is another great tune with its Beach Boy's \\"Good Vibrations\\" sounding riffs. The song also might ring true for those trying to find themselves and not finding anything in life that's truly interesting or exciting. The short, but fast paced \\"The Meaning Of Soul\\" is a nice punker. \\"Guess God Thinks I'm Abel\\" has a great vocal harmony reminiscent of the Beatles' \\"Lovely Rita\\" and guitar echoes of \\"Two Of Us\\".<br /><br />However, by the time you get to \\"Part Of The Queue\\", the engery wavers a little, and the final four tracks are not as high quality. \\"Let There Be Love\\" stands out, again, as a Beatles-like ballad finishing off an otherwise decent album from a band over a decade old. I'd like to see them continue down this path, and even become more experimental with their sound. I think Oasis still has more songs left to leave their mark.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I heard this on a pbs fund raiser of all places. The music moves me, the harmony and style of music comes from a forgotten time when music was meant to move your soul. I highly recommend this, probably more so that people who liked the score from \\"Return of the King\\" will really enjoy this.
B0006L16N8|5.0|To start off, this new Coldplay CD excels at everything it aspires to be. I could write a review explaining all of its merits but I feel those have been covered already very well by other reviewers. Rather, I would like to question everyone saying this is far worse than Parachutes or AROBTTH. I have heard that the songs are far less memorable and innovative than past songs. Well let me think, I could not get White Shadows out of my head for at least 3 days after first hearing it, and it wasn't a bad thing, I continually wanted to listen to it over and oaver, especially the haunting end.  Speed of Sound does follow the chord progression of Clocks, but the song has a completely different feel with much more structure. Also, it has been said that the last part of the CD blends together and is not exceptional. Give it some time for goodness sake. I did not like Green Eyes until two years after I had the CD. Not every song is supposed to hit you and change your life the first time you hear it.  <br />A second complaint people have is that Coldplay is trying to hard to progress away from the simple acoustic roots. Some have said that Coldplay hasn't changed at all and should be progressing more. First, Coldplay should not be expected to retool their sound every CD. If that is your taste, listen to Radiohead or any of the other constantly changing  bands. For those who think Coldplay has changed too little, I'm sure any of the Coldplay spinoff bands should suit you such as Five for Fighting or Keane, or even Jack Johnson. I believe that Coldplay has done a fair amount of change on this CD with a fresh synth section. <br />The third complaint that is extremely trendy is that of Chris Martins lyrics on this CD. Can these people explain to me when Chris Martin ever had mind blowing lyrics? What exactly was so genius about \\"I wrote a song for you, it was called Yellow\\", or \\" God gave you style God gave you grace, God put a smile upon your face\\"? Coldplays lyrics have always had a innocent simplicity to them, I don't know why that simplicity is only a downfall on this CD. Once again, if you have a need for cryptic deep lyrics, there are many bands out there to suit your needs such as the mars volta and Tool. However, simple honest lyrics have always had as much impact as thought provoking lyrics. Just look at Bob Dylan and even Weezer.  <br />The new coldplay is everything it could be, and those who naysay it do not have a really valid argument if they say they liked coldplay before.
1400032717|5.0|It has all been said below and I write only to add that, in my opinion, the plot is almost irrelevant to the book.  While there is briefly a mystery as to who killed the dog in the night, it is resolved at the midpoint of the story without any denoument and without any cleverness.  Nor does the narrator really \\"solve\\" this mystery although his actions do lead to us discovering the solution, a solution so mundane as to be in itself boring if there was no more to be said.  For those looking for a summer mystery to read, they will have to look elsewhere. <br /> <br />No, what matters in this book is how the narrator responds to the events he observes.  Getting to hear how a teenage autistic boy views the events of his world was one of the most fascinating experiences I've ever had in literature.  Christopher's experiences are both hilarious and also profoundly sad and for this reason what happens makes an interesting read, one I could not put down.  But even more, I learned more in this short book than I have from any other source as to why at least some of the autistic children I've known act the way they do.  My only concern had been whether Haddon was correct in his understanding of autism so it is gratifying to know from the autistic writer below that he is in fact accurate. <br /> <br />Even if Haddon had not gotten it right, Christopher's observations force us to look at our own world in a different light.  It is a profound observation to realize how much of our world we ignore and in fact as Christopher demonstrates, the world is a very difficult place to live unless we can ignore much of what happens around us.   <br /> <br />To me, great literature teaches about deeper reality than we see on our own and does so while being entertaining enough to hold our interest.  Haddon has done this with Curious Incident and I recommend it highly.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Although many are divided about the previous album, Train of Thought, they may have come to a consensus about Octavarium.  The band has thankfully used more variety and has done an amazing job of giving each member a fairly equal share in the music.  It's true that Rudess has a much bigger role in this album than Train of Thought, but he definitely does not \\"dominate\\" the album.  I think many listeners feel there was too much keyboard because there was almost none on the previous album and are not used to having keyboards having importance.  I felt that Portnoy and Petrucci took a slight step back in Octavarium because they had almost total control over TOT, which doesn't mean that there weren't nasty drum fills and classic Petrucci shredding.  In terms of the singing, Octavarium brings out the best of Labrie, even though many fans criticize his abilities.  The musicianship is excellent as usual and touches upon many different styles of playing.  There are two heavier tracks on the album: The Root of All Evil and Panic Attack, both two of my favorite pieces.  The third track, These Walls, blew me away.  The song is in 6/8 (typical DT progression) and is reminiscent of the band's older stuff (Images and Words) and Scenes From a Memory.  The last song, the 24 minute epic, Octavarium, is very unusual, but a good listen, for at the 15 minute mark, the band transitions into a sick instrumental section that is very similar to Dance of Eternity.  With all this said, I honestly did not appreciate these aspects of the new DT masterpiece until about the third time listening to the CD.  My advice is to not speculate the quality of the music too quickly, but rather listen to the songs a few times over until you have fully grasped the new DT direction of 2005.
0393317552|4.0|Jared Diamond's astounding thesis on the developement of human civilizations is one that is thought provoking at the least.  The book provides sound and abundant evidence to a geographical explanation of why certain societies come to be superior over others.      Diamond is able to provide a plethora of historical and climatical evidence far above the realms of mere coincidence, striking down the age-old assumption of race superiority as a practical means for explaning modern dominance.  Do not heed over-zealous rebuttals and objections all too commonly given to this work - after all, one must establish a personal perception before making the yea/neh decision.  Criticism, after all, is the number one method for killing un-popular opinion, as one might notice through the example of Zora-Neale Hurston caught in the rush tide of the Harlem Rennaisance.    The work is not for the adventure seeker either, its romantic sounding title should not give any allusions to action or controversy.  It is based in the interest of science, not popular entertainment.    Two minor flaws persist throughout the book: an inevitable brevity in describing the culture of some societies, and a rather discouraging bias counter-productive to the book's task at hand.  Diamond occasionally flies off the handle to allude a matter-of-fact superiority of the societies whose short-falls he sets out to explain.  He provides excellent evidence to support equality of race which is often marred by over-reactionist commentary.  The reader gets the sense that Diamond would rather envoke a racial flamewar than appeal to the silent objectionalist.    Bias aside, the book is an excellent read and provides a roadmap to understanding human societies through causation and historical truth rather than the high-flung insecurities of modern supremists.
0440217563|4.0|I agree with other readers that there is SOO much to like about Diana Gabaldon's Outlander series. The Scottish phrasing was wonderful, the time travel and historical context incredibly believeable and the warmth and passion between Jamie and Claire so genuine I felt as though I were living it.  However, I also agree that parts were disturbing, especially the physical brutality in both heterosexual and homosexual contexts.   <br /> <br />I've asked myself whether any of the wonder of these books would have been diminished if those scenes had not been portrayed in such detail.  I admit I'm squeamish and perhaps overly sensitive to violence (I didn't see Mel Gibson's The Passion specifically for that reason). Once I knew what was in store, I found myself skipping pages here and there to get beyond those passages and I don't believe I lost a lot in doing so. I had the general sense of how brutal life in that time period was (and war in any timeframe) and feel I was still able to comprehend how deeply their lives, their souls and their passions were intertwined, which is really what makes these stories so amazing.
0060555661|5.0|Warren Buffet calls this the best book ever written on investing, and I whole heartedly agree with him.  Professor Graham elegantly lays out the distinction between an investor and a speculator and makes the convincing case why you should discipline yourself to be a value investor and resist the temptation of speculation.  This book is far superior to Professor Fisher's Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits (also a favorite of Mr. Buffet's). <br /> <br />Much has been made about Jason Zweig's annotations and commentaries in these reviews.  I must admit that reading them made me hesistant to purchase this edition, but in the end my wallet won out and I bought this cheaper copy.  To put it mildly I never thought I could gain so much by spending less money.   Even having gone to law school, I found some of Professor Graham's language hard to follow, but luckily at just the right times Mr. Zweig would clarify a difficult to understand term or obscure historical reference with a footnote.  In his end of chapter commentary Mr. Zweig does a masterful job of relating Professor Graham's comments to present day (especially the internet stock speculation of the late 1990's).  Further, Mr. Zweig does a fantastic job of pulling out the most valuable gems of knowledge from each chapter and expounding upon them with real life examples.  I found Mr. Zweig's annotations to the book to be a priceless addition to this work and therefore I highly recommend this edition to anyone looking to purchase \\"The Intelligent Investor.\\"
B0002O06N0|5.0|Alright, stop. Just listen to me for a second, that's all it takes. This album (and the band) are just awesome. Though nothing further needs to be said, I'll elabourate for you. <br /> <br />Fuzzy guitar, pounding drums and simple-yet-meaningful lyrics sung by a man who knows how to do it, this album has nothing wrong with it. It has everything a rock fan could ask for, with a very blues accent to it. You'll catch some 60's-70's Hendrix type parts now and then, and they fit in just perfectly with the style these geniuses play.  <br /> <br />If I had to use another word (besides blistering, since I already used that!) to describe this, I'd say 'Raw'. It's just not screwed around with at all, these guys are just playing what feels good. And it happens to sound pretty damn good, too.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|Muse is the first great band of this decade, and Absolution is the first perfect CD. Since Yorke and the boys went all Billy Corgan on us, there has been a great void in the art-rock genre. Muse has filled that void single-handedly with this  release.  \\"Stockholm Syndrome\\" and \\"Time is Running Out\\" may have been the two best singles in 2004, and \\"Hysteria\\" is getting much-deserved attention this year. Each of those singles rock, but there is more to Absolution than these standouts. \\"Thoughts of a Dying Atheist\\" and \\"Apocalypse Please\\" and \\"Ruled by Secrecy\\" are flawless. The comparisons to Radiohead have regrettably blinded many people to Muse's talent, but Radiohead had their moment. It certainly was a great moment, but they've ditched their guitars and moved on. Now, it is clearly Muse's time. Art rock has never been better.
B000002U82|5.0|This is Pink Floyd, the innovative, first band of progressive rock's masterpiece album. It is wonderfully original with a unique selection of instruments and vocals. I don't see how some people (even the ones who HATE this album) can't give Pink Floyd the credit they deserve for making a record like this. Some people just don't see the light... <br /> <br />Fav tracks: \\"The Great Gig in the Sky\\", \\"Us and Them\\" <br /> <br />But really...all the tracks are good.
0440416027|5.0|this book is fabulous!!! it simply takes your breath away. the writing is majestic and emotional, and mysterious at the same time. there is so much more going on then just the obvious plot written in the book. this book is unlike your classic fantasy, there are no epic battles or wizards. the main characters are so beleivable and realistic its astounding. this book is about love and hope, and their changing powers, and help coming from unexpected places when you need it most. it is very deep, and people who like light books, even though this book is fairly thin, will think its plot is hefty. this book is and excellent book to read when your feeling a little down or just need a positive story. this story is fantastic, and one of those books you always remember.
B00004U8JV|5.0|With the exception of the annoying girlriend, \\"The Lost World\\" was an amazing movie.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Michael Moore's facts are presented meticulously <br />It is a proven fact that the Iraq war does not have a single thing in the world to do with the events of 9/11 <br />Any person with a brain in their head can see that the Bush Administration did not act at attempting to capture Osama Bin Laden-he was given a 2 month head start to slip away.It is also true that if you don't realize that the Iraq war hasn't a single thing to do with 9/11 than you are simply not paying attention to facts <br />Most importantly Fahrenheit 9/11 takes us into see the awful cost of brutal war waged preemptivley-he gives us the images and sounds that the Bush Administration doesn't want you to see,hear or know about.The corporate American media has often played the role of being mainly cheerleaders for the Iraq war trying to get viewers excited that \\"we are killing bad guys\\" in a cowboy like fashion. <br />All in all this film simply presents what has been repressed from the American public for the past 4+ years. <br />Those who claim that anything at all in Moore's documentary is untrue simply don't know what their talking about.
B00049QQHI|1.0|Oh Leo.. why would you take this role?? I guess I can justify it since it was his early days. I rented this movie on whim. I thought this movie was perhaps a fun look at life as a teenager.. boy was I ever wrong. It was not about diaries and there was very little basketball involved. I was hoping for an inspirational story about a boy who came out of a rough neighborhood, wins the state basketball tournament, gets the girl and receives a full scholarship to Harvard, while recording these life changing moments in his diary. However, none of those events happened. I guess next time I will read the back of the movie to save myself many months of nightmares and therapy.
B00029NMRM|4.0|As a huuuuge fan of \\"The Whole Nine Yards\\" I knew that there was no way ANY sequel would ever match the comedy and plot twists as the first.  This being said, I went into this film with minimal expectations.   <br />Well, this movie turned out better than I had hoped.  The cast is still fun to watch and the story, aalthough a little confusing at times, is still plausable and symetric with the first movie.   <br /> <br />Matthew Perry plays 'Oz', a dentist, who recently married 'Cymthia', 'Jimmy the Tulips'(Bruce Willis) ex-wife.  Picking up where he left off in the original, Perry is hilarious in this film.  'Oz' is a very scared man after all that he had been thru in the first film; and, Perry plays this to perfection.  WHile this role for 'Oz' is different than the first; where he played a Dentist who simply had no clue what was happening around him; it still works with the plot and is a pleasant change-of-pace for the sequel.  'Oz' has decided to arm his house with guns and monitor the perimeter with cameras.  This drives his wife, 'Cynthia' mad to the point where she goes behind his back and plots an inheritance heist with her ex-husband 'Jimmy'.  NAturally, the the 'heist' involves both 'Oz' and hitwoman-wannabe, 'Jill'(Amanda Peat).   <br /> <br />The plot involves 'Yanni Gogalack's' father, threatening 'Oz' and kidnapping 'Cynthia' for information as to the whereabouts of 'Jimmy'(or Yimmy') as the 'Gogalacks' always say.  The rest of the movie is basically the unraveling of the planned 'heist'.   <br /> <br />Amanda Peat is great in this film, as is her character 'Jill'.  IN this one, they play-out the fact that she wants to be a professional hit-woman and continuously screws up potential 'jobs'.  Sh eplays the role well, albeit the fact that this is a 'cheesy' comedy.   <br /> <br />Bruce Willis is good and believable as 'Jimmy', but 'Jimmy' is pretending to be psychaotic thruoughout most of the film and it does get a little annoying after awhile. <br /> <br/>Matthew Perry makes this film, much as he did the first.  He is constantly being picked-on by 'Jimmy' and he just takes it all in stride so well.  He's really funny in this film. <br /> <br />ALl-in-all I would recommend this film, but DO NOT expect anything near as good as the first. <br /> <br />
1400032717|5.0|I picked up this book last year in the UK before it became real big here. Not knowing what to expect, I was fascinated to get a glimpse into the mind of an autistic child. I loved this book, it was moving and funny at the same time.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay has done it again.. This Cd is excellent..There are so many good tracks on the cd.. Square One, White Shadows, Speed of Sound, A Message are all of high quality.. So what if they sound U2'ish or Like Pink Floyd on some tracks they are 2 of the best groups ever.. I watched Vh1's Storytellers with Coldplay and was very moved by the track Fix You, and its still moving on the cd also the best track in my opinion, the 4 part harmonies in the song are beautful..also the hidden track till kingdom comes is waiting for someone to record it.. it was meant for johnny cash, but maybe bruce springsteen, or john mellencamp could do it.
0596000480|5.0|Like a lot of people who have been doing web work for a while, I had learned JavaScript a little at a time, figuring out a few tricks here and there but never really going that deep. I had always sort of written it off as a light-weight language and had turned to Perl or PHP when I really needed to do something serious on the web. This book has changed all of that. From start to finish, the explanations were clear and thorough and I came away with a very solid understanding of the language. There are lots of books and web sites that will teach you how to pop open a new window or do a simple rollover, but if you're ready to really learn what JavaScript can do, this book is the one to turn to.
B000268QB2|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I've heard in years!  It's interesting that there is no guitar player in this band, but they don't need one!  The keyboard player leads the band musically with his passionate playing, while the vocalist wows the listening audience with his wide vocal range & soulful, heartfelt lyrics.  This band is also extremely amazing in concert; they sound exactly like they do on the CD!  I see this group going VERY FAR!  I'm looking forward to their next release with great anticipation!
B0002XDODU|5.0|This album is amazing(no real shocker since all rammstein albums are amazing) seriously though, if you gonna obssess over a band that you cant understand, obssess over rammstein. simply an amazing band. guitar, vocals, song meanings. theyve got everything to offer. get all of their cds though. its a better deal off of itunes so check that out. rammstein is my second favorite band only to cky. by the way, an answer can be found is coming out june 28. dont  miss it.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I will not dissect this album track-by-track, for that differs by individuals.  I will say that this album puts Coldplay at the forefront of modern rock stardom.  X&Y is darker and more \\"alternative\\" than their previous efforts, and it really works.  I had to listen to this album several times before reviewing because it has many layers that their last two albums did not have.  Any fan of good alternative music should find this album a necessity...buy it!
B0006L16N8|2.0|The first two songs are pretty good, but Chris Martin's yodeling really grates on my nerves by about the seventh track.  If it weren't for his annoying way of singing (the guy has a great voice - I just don't like what he does with it ALL the time), this would be a better album.
B000089RVR|5.0|It's a grey day in (usually sunny) Florida as the outer bands of tropical storm, Arlene are starting to dump a ton of rain outside. For melancholy weather such as this, I put the perfect musical soundtrack into the CD player... Dido's \\"Life for Rent\\". To be perfectly honest, I picked this CD up at my used CD shop for the two very worst reasons anybody could ever buy a CD. One, a really pretty girl at a party told me she loved it and two, I liked the cover. Pretty bad...huh? Well, once I started playing the CD, I couldn't get that voice and the songs out of my brain! Dido has this almost haunting voice, that just stays with you. It soars over the trip-hoppy/trance like beat of the music. When she sings a song, boy do you believe it! The only way I can put it is that she really knows how to get across the emotions, that are are behind the tunes. That voice just seems to cut you to the bone and goes right through you. Earlier I had mentioned a storm reminding me of this CD and that seems to be the perfect metaphor for \\"Life for Rent\\". It's the storm that follows having your heart broken. The whole album seems to be about having love in your life and losing it. Thats my take on it. I don't know a whole lot about Dido Armstrong or her personal life. But this women must have been through one heck of a nasty romantic break-up to unleash the lyrics and emotions behind some of these tunes. Probably one of the most bitter is \\"See You When You're 40\\". She sings...\\"you think you are complicated, deep mystery to all/well it's taken me a while to see, you're not so special/all energy no meaning with a lot of words/so paper thin that one real feeling could knock you down.\\" Boy, would I hate to be on the recieving end of those lyrics! All the songs on this album are just so memorable. \\"White Flag\\" (one my favorites on the CD) at first glance is a fist pumping anthem about love. But if you really take a close look at the lyrics, the singer seems to be both obsessive and destructive about her failed relationship declaring \\"I will go down with this ship and I won't put my hands up and surrender.\\" Even gaining love shows signs of bitterness. On \\"Mary's Gone to India\\" the singer is pretty much telling the character, Mary off. Apparently Mary left for India, dumping her boyfriend, Danny. The singer is pretty meanly telling her, well you might have treated him like sh_t, but he's mine now and I'm going to treat him right! Other great songs on this album include the title song \\"Life for Rent\\" and the delightful post-vaction, \\"Sand in My Shoes\\". At least \\"Life for Rent\\" ends on a happy note with the post break-up, get out of bed tune, \\"See the Sun\\". On that song, Dido sings \\"And you probably don't want to hear tommorow's another day/but I promise you, you'll see the sun again/and you're asking me why the pain's the only way to happiness/and I promise you, you'll see the sun again.\\" That's a good thing to know. Thanks for a great piece of music Dido!

B00005J6UP|5.0|This movie has to be one of the all time great kids movies.  Highly recommended and worth buying, especially if you have kids under the age of 12.  This movie was the original Pirates of the Carribean (with Johnny Depp).  If you, or your kids liked that then you will like this, guaranteed.  Usually child actors screw up movies in my opinion but in this they actually make the movie.  Corey Feldman plays \\"Mouth\\" masterfully and Sean Astin is great as Mikey.  And...of course Chunk.  Probably that kid's best role of his life if he ever did anything after the Goonies.   <br />NOTE:  to all the Goonie faithful...supposedly there is a Goonies 2 in development.  Let's hope it can live up to the original.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Picked up a copy of this early and yes,it is in DTS 5.1 and 1.78 widescreen that is near perfection
B0006L16N8|3.0|X&Y is A Rush of Blood to the Head over again, just with guitars this time.  The songs are predictable.  While I like 'Speed of Sound,' it's 'Clocks' done over again.  I think Coldplay may have felt the pressure of recording the album quickly after the long delay of time, and they may have figured that the best way to reach their consituency was to be conservative with the musical ideas that make up the album. <br /> <br />My favorite songs:  'What If,' a very good ballad, and 'White Shadows,' an awesome rocker.  Other good songs:  'Speed of Sound,' 'Swallowed by the Sea,' and 'Talk.'  'Square One' is dreadful with the techno beat, and 'Fix You' is not what it is hyped up to be, especially with the ugly pickup.  The others aren't bad, but for the most part they sound unoriginal (excepting 'Til Kingdom Come).  I do like the strings at the end of the title track, though. <br /> <br />It seems to me that Coldplay couldn't wait any longer to record the album...that may be why it sounds ho-hum.  They had to keep their fans and have an exciting live performance.  Chris Martin's voice must hurt from singing falsetto so much...geez.  They'll get away with this one, but next time, they better reinvent themselves, or else fans will be lamenting the death of Coldplay.
B00097A5HW|5.0|Oh Shakira...the Spanish world's favorite Belly Dancer. After what seemed a long turn of events during which the English-speaking world fell in love with her and her Spanish fans salivated for more material in Spanish, the Colombian princess returns with her (what I feel) best work yet. No booty shaking here or any other distractions, it's just Shakira's diary and nothing else. <br /> <br />Produced once again by Shakira and executively produced by Rick Rubin, this album paints yet another wonderful portrait of this young girl's mind, in which we find love, confusion and at times, fun. Gone are her broken English words and the Ricky Martin-esque production of her debut English album. The mostly downbeat album oozes with honest emotion and integrity, something completely missing in the music world, let alone the Spanish world. During an age full of Britneys, J.Lo's and Paulina's, it's nice to hear some convincing songs about a girls tribulations. <br /> <br />I'm sure this album will come as a change to her legions of fanaticals..as most of them jumped on the Shakira bandwagon after her 1998 Emilio Estefan-spiked album \\"Donde Estan Los Ladrones?\\". Yet this album, with its use of sliding guitar and basic piano, sounds mostly downbeat. I for one, welcome this \\"return\\" to the stripped down sound, mostly hear on her magnificent 1996 album \\"Pies Descalzos\\". Its such a pleasure to once again her Shakira's throaty wailing and a quiet background, instead of the cookie cutter Latin Pop branded beats of her last 2 albums.  <br /> <br />The album does have its moments of upbeat sounds. For example, the Brit-Pop induced \\"La Pared\\", the B-52's new wave \\"Escondite Ingles\\" and the total Electro-Pop song \\"Las De La Intuicin\\", which I am sure if released would be a massive hit for her.  After all this time, I'm relieved to realize that the belly dancing, booty shaking and blonde hair were merely distractions and were never indication that Shakira was no longer interested in creatingmusical art. Shakira was always here even during this hurricane of popularity <br /> <br /> <br />Welcome back Shakira! I knew you still hadn't changed.  Now if she could only get rid of that fried blonde hair. The girl's got such natural beauty..it's a shame she's no longer a brunette like she should be.
0156027321|5.0|Life of Pi is super great! I needed some clever fun reading and Yann Martel's Life of Pi certain delivered an amusing reading experience. <br /> <br />The first part of the book, where a young Hindu boy becomes interested in both Christianity and Islam and begins to identify with all three religious traditions was wonderful. Pi found that the love of God integrated all the 'details' surrounding the three religions and he found all three to be full of truth, wisdom, and a route to God. Maybe the great religious experience of the modern era is that in which a person leaves the religion of their forefathers and takes a religious journey with another faith, learning new ways in which God is revealed, and then returns to their original faith with new exergy and expanded consciousness of the vast nature of God. John Donne in The Way of All Flesh explores this concept theologically in the same way that Martel explores this idea in fiction. <br /> <br />The story of the life on the lifeboat with the tiger and other animals was so well written that I could not put the book down.  <br /> <br />Finally, the resolution of the parable in the final pages is concise and razor sharp. We can chose to believe in God and experience God in our lives or we can chose not to believe. In the end, the lived daily human experience might be 'the better story' if we make the journey with God. <br /> <br />Bravo for a new classic.
B00097DX3U|5.0|The second release from Audioslave is their crowning achievement.  Granted, they presently only have a small body of work but, the new disc indicates the sky is the limit for this band.  In my honest appraisal I believe this disc is a slight improvement from the first release but, that does not diminish my opinion of the disc.  You only have to give this disc a couple of listens before you realize that it is a masterpiece.  This disc is a template on how classic music is made.  Chris Cornell is one of the stellar vocalist in the hard rock genre at the present time.  And the guitar work of Tom Morello separates Audioslave's sound from their competitors.  Jump on the bandwagon now!  Audioslave is the face of rock music in the future.  Take a listen to #1 Zero to get an idea what all the fuss is about.
B0009IW98O|4.0|About 10 years ago, Bob Seger did have most of his early Capitol albums on CD (with the exception of Noah, Brand New Morning and the holy grail of Seger albums Back In 72 with the original version of Turn The Page), and for some reason Ramblin Gamblin Man, Mongrel and Seven as well as Smokin OPs were deleted, leaving fans who wanted the CDs try to outbid one another on EBAY. <br /> <br />Perhaps Bob finally got the message from his fans and did managed to re release the very popular Smokin OPs, a stunning collection of cover versions that Bob liked. It doesn't get any heavier with lead track Bo Diddley to which even on the CD version, the bass rumbles through the speakers.  Hey Bob, who do you love?  <br /> <br />Other faves include Love The One You're With, a version that is just as good if not better than Stephen Stills, and a version of If I Were A Carpenter which has to be heard to be believed.  On the other side of the record, you have Let It Rock and Turn On Your Love Light which pays homage to Chuck Berry and Bobby Blue Bland. The ballads Someday and Leon Russell's Hummingbird does sound kinda out of place granted with the rock and roll on this album, and it all concludes with Heavy Music, which sounds like it was mastered off a 45. Love the bass on that. <br /> <br />Certainly Bob is proud of Night Moves and beyond, however the early Capitol Seger years shows that alongside Detroit superstars Iggy and the Stooges, Mitch Ryder and The Detroit Wheels, MC5 and a few others, that Bob was a rocking force to be reckon with as well. This is true rock and roll, and it's great to see Smoking OPs back in print. Now Bob how about releasing the rest again? (Seven, Back In 72, etc etc) <br /> <br />Fun fact. Smoking OPs was recorded at a studio with a bowling alley upstairs (Pampa Lanes).
B000002BBY|5.0|This CD makes me feel wonderful.  If you're a new Oasis fan, this one is a necessity to own-buy it first.  Personal favourite songs:  She's Electric, Wonderwall, and Some Might Say.  Great music for speeding on the highway with the windows rolled down and the wind in your hair.  BUY IT.
0440234743|5.0|I read this book in two days. It took that long because I was on vacation and travelling from place to place.  A great story. I havent read Grisham for quite a while and this brought me back to the fold.    My heart went out to Nate O'Reilly (I'm a 'gooder'). I only wanted his salvation as did Rachel Lane.  In my business, I am not a fan of lawyers and it didnt get any better reading this book.  I wanted all the heirs and lawyers to get kicked in the (...).    For me, this was a page turner. I dont judge the specifics; just wanted a good story to hold my interest.  It did.
B0009A1AS2|1.0|Prior to purchasing Octavarium my least favorite Dream Theater cd was Falling Into Infinity, now I can say my least favorite cd is Octavarium. <br /> <br />I hope the record company wasn't rushing them to make another cd because that is exactly how it feels, \\"rushed\\".  Jordan Rudess and John Petrucci's solo's feel rushed.  Almost like they are trying to play as many notes as possible in their alloted time for the solo.   <br /> <br />What happened to the storyline, the build up of the solo to the point where you just let go and let them drive you through the song, the \\"did you just hear what i heard?\\" songs of the past.  Octavarium is a straight ahead rock/pop ballad.  They even have a 4 minute song on the album, wow!!! <br /> <br />Octavarium is more of a pop rock album rather than the intricate, jaw-dropping insanity that you've come to expect from Dream Theater. <br /> <br />1 - Root of all evil:  You can tell right away that something is different with this cd by listening to the first song.  Overall, nothing great, nothing bad about this song. <br /> <br />2 - Answer lies within: Pop rock all the way.  This would be a song to smash through the billboard top 20.  I can just see the 13 year old girls going crazy over this one. <br /> <br />3 - These Walls:  See #2, Answer lies within. <br /> <br />4 - I walk beside you:  I didn't know U2 played on this album?  Seriously this is U2, not Dream Theater!! <br /> <br />5 - Panic Attack:  Noise, nothing more, nothing less. <br /> <br />6 - Never Enough:  This is probably the song that most resembles the Dream Theater that I know, right now my favorite song on the album. <br /> <br />7 - Sacrificed Sons:  Similar to #6, Never Enough. <br /> <br />8 - Octavarium:  Holy makes me fall asleep batman!  That intro is as boring as watching paint dry.   <br />  <br />Octavarium the cd, I won't be using it as a frisbee or a beverage coaster, but then again I won't be using it in my cd player either.   <br /> <br />I guess even the great Dream Theater can make a bad cd.
B00005AQF7|5.0|DOGGYSTYLE is the perfect counterpart to the legendary Dr. Dre masterpiece THE CHRONIC.  Dre sits back and gives Snoop full control of the mic this time after having him steal the show lyrically on his own record and Snoop is more than up for the challenge.  He takes the opportunity and with Dre's G-funk production backing him becomes the biggest rap star in the world.  And if Snoop's laid back gangsta/pimp flow isn't enough Death Row family artists like Nate Dogg, Warren G, Daz and Kurupt are back again to join in on this gangsta-funk party celebrating p****, gin, juice, chronic and indo.  \\"Ain't No Fun(If My Homies Can't Have None)\\" is reminiscent of Dre's N.W.A. productions from NIGGAZ4LIFE like \\"She Swallowed It\\" and \\"Automobile\\" where sex is very much a laughing matter.  On \\"Murder Was The Case\\" Snoop is more introspective about urban realities that came far to close to becoming true for the former Crip after he and his bodyguard were charged with murder in the year following the release of this album.  And there are more than enough party songs like \\"Gin And Juice\\" and \\"Who Am I? (What's My Name?)\\" as well as many more.  DOGGYSTYLE is simply one of the best rap albums ever recorded.
B0006L16N8|2.0|After discovering Coldplay by hearing and enjoying \\"Rush\\", this is a big disappointment. The music sounds like one long song split 14 different ways, and left on the floor from the previous cd. Coldplay will need to make some dramatic changes to their next cd, otherwise I'll be looking elsewhere for some new music.
B0006L16N8|3.0|I have always gone back and forth on Coldplay.  Having fallen in love with the song \\"Yellow\\" off their debut album, I bought the album and liked only a handful of songs.  When A Rush of Blood to the Head came out, I enjoyed a larger portion of the songs, but really only the first 5 were ones I'd listen to on a regular basis.  Don't get me wrong, the five songs I listened to, I loved.  But that left 6 songs that I didn't care for and grew bored after listening to.  Regardless, it seemed as if they were moving forward to me as I only really liked 2 songs off the first album.    Which leads us to their third album, X&Y.  This album is very much like A Rush of Blood To the Head.  It's very melodic, smooth, mostly quiet and generally good to listen to.  Not much has changed.  The songs usually start out quietly, build to a a) pounding guitar b) pounding piano or c) both and end either at a pounding climax or quietly like the song began.  Toss in some soul-searching words and self-abrasive lyrics or \\"I am really good for you, just give me a chance\\" lyrics and you have the new cd in a nutshell.  This is not to attack Coldplay, but to tell it like it is.    Here's the break down: for those who really love Coldplay, these fans will love this cd because it gives them what they've been given before, add 2 stars.  For those who hate Coldplay with a passion, the cd will probably cement those feelings even more so take away 2 stars.     For those like me, I'm once again vaguely disappointed that there weren't more songs like \\"Speed of Sound\\" or \\"Fix You,\\" \\"Clocks\\" or \\"Yellow.\\"  I'm on the fence.  X&Y is basically a different album, same Coldplay.  How you feel about them before will dictate your feelings about X&Y.  This album won't change it.
B00003OSTN|4.0|Joan Crawford plays \\"Mildred Pierce\\" in this sad tale of a loving mother, her willingness to do nearly anything to provide a better life for her family, and her ultimate failure to do so.  Mildred (Joan Crawford) is married to Albert `Bert'  Pierce (Bruce Bennet).   He has trouble keeping a job or providing enough money to give their 2 daughters the finer things in life.  Kay Pierce (Jo Ann Marlowe) and Veda Pierce (Ann Blythe) are Mildred's reason for living and she lavishes them with everything a child could want.  This doting behavior causes strife between Bert and Mildred due to the fact that the lifestyle Mildred wants to provide for the daughters is a financial impossibility.  Mildred sells baked goods and caters local parties from her home in an attempt to raise money for her daughters.  This furthers the rip in the family fabric, as Bert sees this as an insult to his ability to be the breadwinner.  It becomes obvious at this point that Bert and Mildred have differences that cannot be resolved.  Bert and Mildred decide to separate.  We also are introduced to Veda's horrifically flawed character as she complains that a dress her mother buys for her is nothing more than a rag, and is not good enough to be seen in public. The split between Bert and Mildred spurs her into action and she is resolved to do whatever it takes to provide the best for her Veda.  She decides that she can make money in the restaurant business since she's been making a profit selling food from home and catering parties.  Mildred is ultimately introduced to Monty Beragon (Zachary Scott) by Wally Fay (Jack Carson), her husband's ex-business partner.  Wally is a fast talking realtor, who tries to angle on Mildred at every opportunity, but goes nowhere romantically with her.  Monty Beragon comes from a wealthy family, but is apparently having financial problems, and agrees to let Mildred take possession of some of his property without paying him up front.  She agrees to pay him back in full within a year.  This property takes shape and her restaurant business launches.  She and Monty start to spend time together and eventually become romantic.  The business continues to flourish while her relationship and control with Veda starts to decline.  Veda wants more and more from her mother, and will say and do anything to get what she wants.  Veda even goes so far as to fake a pregnancy to extort $10,000 from the supposed father.  Mildred tears the check up and tells Veda to leave.  At this point Mildred and Monty start to have financial difficulties as he and Veda continue to use Mildred and spend all her hard earned money, and show absolutely no gratitude for it.  Veda eventually goes to work as a showgirl since being removed from her mother's money supply.  Mildred, in the meantime, takes a vacation and returns resolved to make amends with Veda.  She decides to buy a fancy new home and marry Monty Beragon, even though she has no respect for him and is not in love.  She does this solely to appease Veda again and try to gain her love.  Veda does come home and she and Monty once again drain Mildred financially to the point of bankruptcy.  Veda is ashamed of her mother and repays her love with the ultimate slap in the face as we see Veda's current love interest and the catalyst for violence.  The end result of all of Mildred's hard work to be a good mother backfires with horrible consequences for everyone involved.  She has poured everything into pleasing Veda and providing anything she could want, but in the end Veda still wants more.  This time however there is nothing more Mildred can do for her reprehensible daughter, and Veda finally gets what she deserves.  I would rate this film at 4 stars.  It has as much validity today as  it did in 1945 when first released.  It runs 109 min and is presented in black and white.
0064409422|5.0|<br />The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe is an adventurous story about four children who are sent away from London because of air raids to an old professor's house. Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy soon realize that they have a lot of freedom due to the lack of supervision and decide to play a game of hide and seek in the house. All throughout the house there are unused rooms and passages that take them to places they had not known about. While playing this game, Lucy comes across an old wardrobe. She goes in thinking nothing of it, and finds something beyond her imagination. \\"A moment later she found that she was standing in the middle of a wood at night-time with snow under her feet and snowflakes falling though the air\\" (p 113.) I thought this book was completely brilliant and thoroughly enjoyed reading it. It gave me a sense of adventure and sparked my imagination. It kept me reading because there was a surprise around every corner. I would recommend this book to anyone that is looking for a good fiction/ fantasy novel, or to a person that has a real sense of adventure and is not afraid to use their imagination.  <br />
B000023VR6|5.0|Dr. Dre returned to the forefront of rap with this 1999 release of 2001(Dre's always ahead of his time).  After leaving Death Row Records where he produced some of the most classic records in rap history he launched his own Aftermath Records but aside from the disappointing DR. DRE PRESENTS...THE AFTERMATH and some production work on THE FIRM laid relatively low for a period of time from late '96 until '99 when he discovered and launched the career of an unknown white rapper named Eminem.  One could say that Eminem was as responsible for bringing the already legendary Dr. Dre back as Dre was for making Eminem the megastar he became.  On the heels of the multiplatinum THE SLIM SHADY LP it was time for Dre to release his first official solo album in 7 years.  While no album by any artist may ever top THE CHRONIC, 2001 did not disappoint.  Dre proved he still had what it takes behind the boards with classic beat after classic beat updating the style he perfected on THE CHRONIC with a freshness that was still classic Dre.  On the other side of the glass, with help from Eminem and others penning lyrics, he proved himself still worthy of holding the mic.  His delivery might have rusted slighty since the last time we heard him, but Dre's not known near as much for his MC skills as being able to piece together a classic album.  And with Eminem spitting the most memorable lines, Nate Dogg returning for the sequal and introducing Xzibit to the mainstream there are plenty of lyrical highlights on this CD.  Snoop Dogg might not flow quite as fast or as smooth as he did on earlier Dr. Dre produced Death Row releases, but his voice will always be welcome over a Dr. Dre beat.  This album cemented Dr. Dre's place as a legend in rap.
B00006AW2M|4.0|A brave album, but not the best in the boys' inventory, that's for sure. 2,000 Light Years, with its haunting mellotron intro by Brian Jones was one of the best songs of the entire Psychedelic era and easily the standout song here, although the superb She's A Rainbow and The Lantern are two other great songs. <br /> <br />The Stones put out a superb single called We Love You in this general time period, and it always seemed like it should have been on Majesties, to me. <br /> <br />As for influences, if you ever read background bios on the Stones and the Beatles or even catch some of the many interviews that Paul McCartney and Mick Jagger have done over the years, you realize that the bands of the time all influenced each other, and that the Stones and The Beatles were actually friends, who hung out together. <br /> <br />Apart from the fact that many bands owed a tremendous debt to the early Blues artists, they all borrowed ideas and innovations from each other; so The Byrds, The Beach Boys, The Rolling Stones and The Beatles couldn't fail to have an effect on each other's work - but it was all amicable, with respect being the watchword. <br /> <br />Definitely worth having in your collection, but not a representative Stones album by any means. Beggar's Banquet or Let It Bleed would be a better entry point if you wanted to try out some classic Stones, although with this band, you pretty well can't go wrong by picking an album at random. <br /> <br /> <br />
0393035158|4.0|Having read a review of this book in the New York Times Book Review (written by, if I remember correctly, Susan Jacoby) I got the feeling this book would be a balm to my heathen soul, so to speak.  Considering that Harris had me at the title, there was no way I wouldn't read this book.  Indeed, right from the first chapter, he had me shouting secular humanist \\"hallelujahs\\" 'til I was hoarse (and embarrassed, considering on was on a train).  There are many passages here that should be on t-shirts, mugs, billboards, etc.  This is of course a bad idea, because that's exactly the sort of thing \\"People of Faith\\" do that annoys the hell out of me (that, and trying to change the law to conform to their personal fairy tales, but I digress).  Actually, annoying \\"People of Faith\\" is probably the sort of thing that Mr. Harris would revel in.<br /><br />One of the main themes in \\"The End of Faith\\" is that extremists are only part of the problem.  The more pernicious threat, as he sees it, comes instead from religious moderates.  By providing a support system for the extremist's core beliefs, moderates only increase the possibility that something, well, something really BAD will happen (as in rogue-nuclear-device bad).  A moderate cannot calm an extremist, because at the core, they're cut from the same cloth.  This gave me some problems at first, since after all we can't expect the Bible Belt to fall into mass apostasy, and moderates are of course, not bombing anything, so at least there's a small opening for the start of a somewhat reasonable discussion.  Harris isn't having any of it, though.  The book's title is as much a statement of purpose as a provocation.<br /><br />Along the way, we are treated to lengthy smackdowns of the Old Testament and the Koran (included are literally pages worth of Koranic verses exhorting the virtues of violence against unbelievers), and brief swipes at the religious right (yay!) and even Noam Chomsky (an unreasoned wolf in academic clothing).  There is a chapter about the neurological underpinnings of belief (Harris is completing his doctorate in neuroscience) that I had to read twice to understand, and a chapter about the philosophy of ethics and morality that totally went over my head, but then I still have trouble spelling Nietsh...uh, Nietzs...oh you know, that crazy German guy.<br /><br />The last chapter is where a lot of hard-line atheists will be disappointed.  In it, Harris prescribes a kind of logical, non-supernatural approach to Buddhist meditation as an antidote to prayer or \\"spirtitual experience.\\"  He asserts that people seem to need some sort of transcendence, so why not look Eastward, where at least the religious atmosphere is a bit less scary and violent?  A review in the secular humanist magazine Free Inquiry dismissed the idea, and indeed it left a bad taste in the reviewer's mouth.  I think he misread the chapter, but I concede where Harris leaves the matter open to misinterpretation.  I nonetheless find it an interesting avenue of investigation.<br /><br />Not long after finishing the book, I visited the author's website (samharris.org) where I found video clips of his television appearances.  I was rather unnerved to discover that he seemed to appear only on programs that would be the least hospitable to his point of view.  In one, a rude cable news screaming head dismisses him and asks if Harris is an atheist.  To my horror, Harris seems to dodge the question, and is promptly cut off.  Why couldn't he say something like \\"of course I'm an atheist, you shrieking idiot, but it goes a bit deeper than that\\"?  In clip after clip, as Harris practically quotes his book verbatim, one is left with the uncomfortable conclusion that, in the end, he's just another author desperately trying to plug his book.  Mind you, the hurricane force of this particular book is a galvanic experience that needs to be sold to at least 90% of Americans, but I think a reasoned approach to Buddhist meditation might be necessary to get rid of that unfortunate bad taste...editation might be necessary to get rid of that unfortunate bad taste...
B00097A5HW|3.0|After listening to the album all the way through about three times, I have come to realize this album, although in Spanish, is built for cross over success. That is not in any way a bad thing, but purists will have issue with this album. \\"La Tortura\\", the first single with Spanish Crooner Alejandro Sanz is the best track and is worthy of top ten single of the year 2005 status. The rest of the cd is a mix of odd fillers where Shakira is off vocally to solid tracks that are not singles but qulaity tracks that make the album worth the purchase. She is in a sense, the victim of her own standard she set with \\"Pies Desclados\\" and the unforgetable classic album \\"Donde Esta Los Ladrones?\\". Last, being Latino, I am personally happy to see her return to Spanish. Trust me English speakers, she sounds much better in her native tongue. Todovia te queiro Shakira!!!!Como Siempre Amor!!!!
B000068TSI|5.0|This is a great movie. It is hard to explain why, because it brings up feelings that are hard to explain. I can say that it probably depicts the battle very truthfully. I have the book too, and this movie differs very little from the book. There are a few things that are put in that actually happened later. For example, this movie has the North Vietnamese realising that to overrun the Americans, they have to get in close enough to avoid artilery. It did not happen until a battle shortly after Ia Drang. Also, the North Vietnamese never broke through the American lines in Ia Drang. That was later also. Other than that, nearly all of the details of the battle are correct, except that they did not lose a helicopter while bringing men into the landing zone. <br />This movie is very bloody, but it almost has to be to accurately depict the action. The movie would not have seemed quite as real without it. <br />Overall, it is a very good movie. I would highly recommend that you see this movie. Even more, I would recommend that you read the book \\"We Were Soldiers Once... and Young\\", which is the book from which this movie was made. It tells about not just the battle, but before and after, telling about what happened to some of the men after they returned from battle. Read or watch and enjoy.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I never liked A7X before, I found them a mix between Metallica-style playing and Anselmo-style singing mixed in with the usual Mallcore flair. I never got into it, why? Because I am a METALHEAD. Now before all you mallcore and hardcore fans start boasting about how your slop-metal is really \\"metal\\", heed my words. Well actually take note from these guys... taking music to a power metal level is no easy task... esspecially for a band that has already secured its foundation in a certain genre.  <br /> <br />I'm pretty sure fans of A7X will be dissapointed... but these guys needed to mature and extend the boundaries of musicianship. Which is what i wish alot of bands with this kind of potential would do. Avenged Sevenfold have succeeded with City of Evil. A melodic, talented, and power metal album that will please anybody who appreciates good metal, musical compositions and talent. Keep this up guys, and as DreamEvil coined it, Welcome to \\"The Book of Heavy Metal\\"!!!
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Octavarium isn't exactly my favorite or even close to my favorite DT album. I'm mainly writing this review not as a bashing of Octavarium, but a bashing of the so-called fans. No matter how long you have liked DT, if you have hadn't noticed they try something new with every album. There's a handful of bands who can accomplish trying something completely different from one album to another yet keep their trademark sound. DT has done it for years and reguardless of what the album sounds like, there's always people who have been listening since '89 or '92 or whatever that bash DT albums. SOAM, 6DOIT, TOT, and now Octavarium. I mean Jesus, if you are a real fan you will give it a few listens. DT is a band that their albums grow on you. After that, if you don't like it then you don't like it. But this is what they have been doing for years. So don't pretend that it's a new concept.
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|I was completely and totally obsessed with Friends that I bought all the seasons up to season 9 and am waiting for season 10 to come out. I never thought that I'd be obsessed with a show like I was with Friends, but ( I really hate when this happens) I was proven very wrong. The O.C. is the ****! I was deployed to Afghanistan while the second season aired, but was able to catch episodes 1-13. I bought the first season on DVD and have almost burned a hole in it. I watch it everyday even though nothing ever changes I have to watch it over and over again. My favorite character is Seth b/c he is, like me, very, very sarcastic. He, in my opinion, is the funiest character on that show. I can guarantee anyone if you can get past the first episode on the first season, then you'll love this show. I started watching the show from episode two on the first season and later saw the first episode and said if I would've seen this episode first I probably wouldn't have gone on to watch the show. There is no show on t.v. right now that is better than The O.C., it appeals to everyone from high schoolers to 40 somethings. This is a must buy DVD...season one too!
B000002BE9|4.0|I look up to her. I am also a musican and I love listening to Fiona Apple. This has to be one of my favorite cd's. It is about love, friendship and hard times. She is a very tallented woman. <br /> <br />
B00000K3D4|5.0|He was perfect for his role! I have always loved \\"Labyrinth\\". After seeing it again I was reminded how good it really is! Everyone needs to see this movie! David Bowie sings good songs. I recommend this along with \\"The Dark Crystal\\" and \\"Legend\\". I think this with those two are very much related with the genre-type................................... <br /> <br /> <br />Jennifer Connelly is hot.
0783117523|4.0|This movie is a tragic tale of the life of supermodel Gia Carnegi. It tells of her life of heartache, addictions, and the rise and fall of her modeling career. Angelina Jolie is exceptional in this movie. She taps into her characters pain and suffering as if it were her own. You feel as if you were watching this horrible train wreck in reality. <br /> <br />It saddens me to see what became of this beautiful model who was covered all over magazines and runways. Unable to deal with the pain and hardships of her life, she turns to drugs as comfort. This movie portrays addiction as it is, ruining the addicts life as well as those around her. It is an account of her life in the fast lane ending in tradgedy. I do not want to give the plot away, but it is worth a watch.
B000929AJQ|4.0|Imagine a dance album soaked in battery acid, with its lush melodies and sledgehammer drumming slowly seeping through your ears like an unavoidable aural plague. It rushes ferocious electronic beats at you, along with an underlining sense of self-discovery and a hint of political bashing. This wave of sound and enlightenment is With Teeth. From the hushed opening beats of \\"All The Love In The World\\" to the anti-bang whimper of \\"Right Where It Belongs,\\" Nine Inch Nails' new album, With Teeth, is a more to the point, song-oriented effort than any of Trent Reznor's prior works. It's not as angry or intense as Pretty Hate Machine (1989) and The Downward Spiral (1994), so it slightly closer resembles The Fragile (1999), minus the elaborate instrumentals. The title track \\"With Teeth\\" contains an incredibly quiet piano interlude in the middle, surrounded by aggressive vocals. As to the album's first single, \\"The Hand That Feeds,\\" NIN fans either love it or hate it because of its so-called \\"accessible\\" sound. It also sounds like a call to arms signaled by Reznor to stand up against President Bush's war in Iraq, \\"What if this whole crusade's/A charade/And behind it all there's a price to be paid.\\" With Teeth is an explosive album from NIN, period; it delivers on what has been anticipated over these past six years. However, if you listen to it and do not agree, then just hit the eject button to save yourself from the auditory plague that is With Teeth.
1400032717|5.0|\\"the curious incident of the dog in the night-time\\" is one of the most interesting books I have ever read. Marck Haddon, the author, doesn't understand human emotions. He also can not lie so the story is true. The book is about a death of a dog and the way he solves this mystery. I would recomend this book to everyone. It is a must read.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This album is awesome, don't listen to the naysayers.  Obviously, it's not for everybody, but it is still owed a certain amount of respect regardless. <br /> <br />each song is catchy, many of which have interesting lyrics.  I can't say there's a single song I dislike on the album. System is a very versatile band as far as musical styles go, and they definitely show this off on the album.   <br /> <br />Although all the songs are very different from each other, they fit together perfectly as an album. <br /> <br />BYOB and revenga have very catchy choruses.  who gives a crap if they sound poppy, they're catchy songs, and they're awesome.  If a song sounds good, it sounds good. end of discussion. <br /> <br />the cocaine song is awesome.  It's just so ridiculous, and almost disturbing. <br /> <br />old school hollywood is cool too.  wasn't expecting to hear an 80's style song from system, but it definitely works.  Makes you giggle. <br /> <br />sad statue is very powerful, and gives me chills when i listen to it.  you know a song is awesome if it gives you chills. <br /> <br />violent pornography is ridiculous, but the song isn't as crude as it sounds.  all it's saying is that life in general is like a violent pornography... everybody f***s, everybody sucks, everbody cries, and everybody dies, its just a nonstop disco. <br /> <br />system is an awesome band, and this is an awesome CD.  you don't have to agree with their politics, the music is what it is, and it rocks.
B000002JSP|5.0|For Led Zeppelin fans, nobody expected that 1979's \\"In Through the Out Door\\" would be the last CD for the legendary quartet. This was because of the untimely death of their legendary drummer, John Bonham.   Many long-time Led Zeppelin fans were disappointed by this 8th studio album by the legendary band. Led Zeppelin had thrilled fans throughout the 1970s by its unique and innovative mix of Blues and Hard Rock.    This album would mark a change by Led Zeppelin as for the first time, the heavy use of Synthesizers were introduced.   But Led Zeppelin has always been a band that has never been short when it comes to innovation.   Despite the criticism of many, Led Zeppelin's \\"In Through the Out Door\\" shows that the innovation is alive - and I think results in one of the band's best releases. <br /> <br />Since the inception of the modern Rock and Roll era in the late 1950s, the popular music landscape has frequently undergone changes.   In the late 1970s, there were several music influences penetrating the music landscape - namely, Disco and Punk Rock.   Many traditional Rock artists were accused of selling out when incorporating new styles into their music (i.e. The Rolling Stones, Rod Stewart).   This is an unfair rap because I think it is good when Rock artists innovate.   As mentioned above, Led Zeppelin has always been a band willing to innovate.   While Led Zeppelin doesn't incorporate Disco or Punk Rock into their music, they do make use of an instrument that is widely used in those genres - the Synthesizer.     John Paul Jones was beginning to do a lot of experimentation with the Synthesizer and worked with the band to incorporate the use of it into the music.   The use of this instrument was one that seemed to disappoint the long-time fans.    However, if you listen to \\"In Through the Out Door\\", you will hear how Led Zeppelin adds a new dimension to their sound - while still maintaining their Blues and Hard Rock edge.    If you listen to artists such as MichaelJackson, you can hear how the Synthesizer sounds very synthetic - at the expense of traditional instruments.   On \\"In Through the Out Door\\", Led Zeppelin uses the Synthesizer to augment the traditional instruments. <br /> <br />Perhaps the only thing that disappoints me on this collection from a musical standpoint is that there are only 7 songs.   Here is a synopsis of each of them: <br /> <br />\\"In the Evening\\": At the beginning you will hear the use of the synthesizers with a slight middle-eastern effect.   The song then progresses into a classic Led Zeppelin Blues/Rock sound. One thing that I always liked about Led Zeppelin is that you can always single out all of the instrumentation- whether its Robert Plant's Vocals, Jimmy Page's Guitar, John Paul Jones' Bass and Keyboards, or John Bonham's drums.  In particular I think Page's guitar chords are right on the money here. <br /> <br />\\"South Bound Suarez\\":  This track also shows that Led Zeppelin hasn't abandoned their Blues roots.   This song has much more of a Honky-Tonk/50s Blues Sound.   John Paul Jones' Keyboards are really going to stand out on this track.   Plant is right on the money with his vocals. <br /> <br />\\"Fool in the Rain\\": While many have accused this song of Led Zeppelin going mainstream, I tend to disagree - this is some of their top innovation.     This song has a slight Caribbean feel to it.  However it also shows the band showcasing what they do best - jamming.    There is a jam that begins about 2 1/2 minutes into the song.   This song seems to come together perfectly.   While everyone really shines on this song, no question it's John Bonham's drumming that is your \\"MVP\\" performance on this album.  His drumming combined with the Latin/Calypso feel is incredible stuff.     <br /> <br />\\"Hot Dog\\":  Another Bluesy song.  This one also has a Honky Tonk Blues feel - but clearly sounds like a \\"Dixie\\" like song.  Once again, Robert Plant is right on the money with his vocals. <br /> <br />\\"Carouselambra\\":  This might imply another Latin sounding song, but this one serves as another Jam session for the band.   Here is where John Paul Jones shows how the synthesizers can enhance the sound of the band.  As always, the band is rock-solid with the delivery of the song. <br /> <br />\\"All My Love\\": This song was a tribute to Robert Plant's son, who had died a few years earlier.   This is another song that appeals to the mainstream fans.   Once again the synthesizers provide some terrific augmentation to the guitar and drum work.  In addition, there is one of Led Zeppelin's all-time great instrumental pieces midway through the song.   Not only is this song solid instrumentally, it is lyrically one of the band's strongest. <br /> <br />\\"I'm Gonna Crawl\\": I admit, this song took me a while to get into.  Once I did, I really liked it.   It seems like there is use of a Steel Guitar in this song. <br /> <br />The only other disappointment of this collection are the liner notes.    There is virtually nothing in the way of liner notes.   The inside of the notes do feature a list of the seven tracks, their length, and the songwriting credits.   I'm really disappointed that the lyrics are not included on this collection.   While most people who buy this album are going to be aware of who the four band members are, it still would have been nice to see a listing of the band members.   However, the liner notes are only a small part of the package here.   The bottom line is that from a musical standpoint, this album has it all.    While some core fans may not care for it, I still think that many will.  This album might have shown us what might have been in-store for 1980s Led Zeppelin - I think they would have even gotten more popular than they were in the 70s.  This is also a great album if you are more of a mainstream fan.   Overall - highly recommended.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I'm not exaggerating.  This has got to be one of or perhaps the best album of the 21st century.  The capabilities of these three guys is simply amazing.  The lead singer is unbelievably talented as a vocalist, keyboardist, and guitarist (it's amazing that he can pull of those three positions so effectively).  His solos are pretty sweet also.  The bassist is quite talented and has a broad range.  The drummer is very exact and versatile and definitely keeps the pace going.  This album is superior to Muse's other releases which were also quite impressive but this one truly shows that they've matured and have found their sound. <br />On to the music, I believe that every song here (with the exception of the intro and interlude of course) deserves to be a single.  This album is extremely consistent in melody, versatility, talent, instrumentals, and everything else.  Don't think that all of those songs sound the same though.  Every song is very different in a very good way and has a very individual and unique style to it.  Some songs like The Small Print and Time is Running Out are flat-out rockers, songs like Butterflies and Hurricanes and Apocalypse Please are keyboard masterpieces, and songs like Endlessly, Blackout, and Ruled by Secrecy are beautifully melodic pieces.  My favorites include Time is Running Out, Sing for Absolution, Endlessly, Butterflies and Hurricanes, and Stockholm Syndrome but there's not a single bad song on this album.  In fact, there's something in this album for everybody.  If you are skeptical about the talent of today's music definitely check these guys out.  And also, about the comparison to Radiohead, Muse is a thousand times better.  Buy this album.  You won't regret it.
B00097A5I6|1.0|Thankyou Oasis but no thankyou, your time is well and trully up, at the moment anyway. <br />Your album don't \\"Beleive the nonsensical lies and dishonesty towards all who like good music and are fans of Oasis\\" is a dissapointment worthy of rating in itself, funnily enough it gets nice well rounded one star. <br /> <br />The album has \\"NO\\" direction and \\"NO\\" purpose, sounding more or less, no more like Oasis take on 1960s rock n roll, which of course has been, been and down and has its place in time, but now I think its time to move on and do something new thankyou very much and givin the \\"DISGUSTING\\" state of new and older bands at the moment (beleive it or not) it was up to you to shine the light. That ended after your great album \\"Heathen Chemistry\\" so thankyou but no thankyou.
B0006L16N8|5.0|If you thought their second albums success was just luck, just give X&Y a few listens and you'll soon realize ColdPlay is for real. I know in todays music, it's hard not to think of all modern bands as disposable commodities, but every once in a great while a band surfaces that can top the charts and still produce their art and not just (manufactured) commerical hits. In those terms, ColdPlay fits the bill and they are a pretty rare find. <br /> <br />I read all the hyper about X&Y so I bought it and I gave it three good listens start to finish and if the band were in front of me I'd ive them a bow out of respect. With any band, it's extreemly difficult to repeat your success when previously you've done very well. You have to not all produce the same quality of songs, but the new material can't be boring and it can't sound too much like waht you've done before. An an amazing achievement. <br /> <br />I won't compare X&Y to the bands older albums, other reviews will do that. The important thing to know here is that there are really great songs on this disc. I can't rank this CD is against Parachutes or A Rush Of Blood... ColdPlay is perhaps the only band where I would say all their albums to date rank equally for me (I'd give them all a five). If you're wondering if there are songs on here as good as The Scientist or Yellow, the answer is yes. Buy it and discover for yourself.
0446310786|5.0|Excellent book!  The second I read the last line of the book, I wanted to start reading all over again.  The story stuck with me for weeks after. I highly recommend this book.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I just got the album yesterday and can't stop listening to it on my MP3 player! It is the most soothing album yet and my favorite.
B00005QXXO|1.0|This album sure does suck. Usually I reserve words like \\"suck\\" for Pearl Jam and Tool, but wow. Radiohead really sucks. I bet Donovan McNabb and Terrell Owens could make a better record than this crap and they hate each other more than Keith Richards and Mick Jagger. Buy the soundtrack to Hedwig & the Angry Inch instead. It's way better because I've got an angry inch! Honk honk! Beep beep!
B0000UJL96|2.0|I don't understand why everyone likes this movie so much.  There is nothing special about it.  It is predictable, has a wooden plot, and runs like a standard TV episode of virtually any action TV show.  There is no imagination, depth, or creativity in it.  It's just a simple shallow drama.  Nothing stands out from it.  I have no idea what the rest here is seeing.  It doesn't compare at all with any of the other Star Trek movies.  Even Star Trek V is better than this.
B0007Y08IS|5.0|You have got to be kidding me?  You thought this would be a movie about Christmas or what?  I honestly can't see how you could have not heard anything about this movie.   <br />85 Delorean Smartness 1 Star.
B000002J09|5.0|Led zeppelin's superb fourth album can be rated amongst the greatest hard rock albums along with Paranoid from Black Sabbath and Machine head from Deep Purple.This album contains terrific songs like Black Dog,Rock and Roll,When the leevee breaks and Stairway to heaven.A must have for every fan of classic rock music.FIVE STARS.
B00004XONN|1.0|That's something I wish Radiohead would do already. They're worse than Tool. Don't buy this album. Buy Bellybutton by Jellyfish. It's way better. I swear to Jesus Christ and Martin Short. Honk honk.
1878424319|1.0|What a load of nonsensical mumbo-jumbo feel-goodism! If you look at some of the things he actually says, you wonder how the book could be so popular. True, once in a while, he wanders in from the wilderness to make a useful statement or even offer sound advice. But his thought processes are nonsensical.<br /><br />An example from p.54: \\"Sometimes you hear a voice in your mind, and you may wonder where it came from. This voice may have come from ANOTHER REALITY in which there are LIVING BEINGS very similar to the human mind.\\" (my emphasis)<br /><br />And on p.26 he quotes from the Bible, John 1:1, and then misinterprets the meaning of \\"Word\\" from that context, and goes on from there to... wherever, it matters not.<br /><br />There may be some nuggets, but I couldn't stand trying to pluck them out of the morass of his Toltec-speak nonsense.
B00005B4GU|1.0|This is really bad. I mean on par with Pearl Jam's Riot Act. Well, no. Not even Riot Act is that bad and that album sucks holy bull balls! Though, maybe Thom Dorke and Eddie Mueller should team up for an album and call it \\"Crybabies in Arms\\" and donate the money to some stupid cause like PETA. Don't buy this record if you like eating meat. Buy Be Here Now by Oasis instead. Noel Gallagher will punch you in the face if you buy this awful record.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|to the previous reviewer, this album went extremely downhill. when i heard Slipknot was releasing a new album, i was happy and ready for it. at first i really liked it and thought it was up there with Iowa which is my favorite cd. but after listening to it, i realized that the band doesnt have the same talent they used to. either that or they are getting all caught up in this new phase going around. i think Iowa boasted their musical skills and pushes them to the max. but this cd went downhill. corey cant do his awesome screams anymore. the style of the band has completely changed since Iowa and even their self-titled album. on Iowa, corey was sreaming his guts out and going all out with his vocal talents. but on Vol 3: (The Subliminal Verses), there is too much clean vocals. corey's scream isnt as good as it used to be, now it is too high. Subliminal Verses went too far away from their old (and awesome) death-metal style. i have to give this album only 1 star because the whole style of the bands music has changed. you shouldnt go from screaming your guts out in Iowa to what they are doing now like they did. you need to do it gradually. i am a HUGE slipknot fan and this change was too much and too sudden. i dont really like it. but dont get me wrong, slipknot is one of the best bands of all time. its a shame that i never had the pleasure to see them in concert. im not trashing the band, im trashing the album and the change in their style. stay sic
B000092ZYX|1.0|That's what they were and are! All they do is rip people off by putting out this crap and having Thom Dorke go onto message boards and create unwarranted buzz for their \\"new\\" records. Don't buy this if you value humanity. I'd rather listen to Core by STP and that record is usually only ok if you're into date rape.
B000002GVO|5.0|The Eagles reached the 80.000.000 mark in 2002. Eighty million records sold - not just of \\"Hotel California\\", of course, but of their entire catalogue. <br />Still, this album is rightly considered their artistic peak as well as their commercial one. Everybody who knows music knows \\"Hotel California\\", one of the ten best-selling LPs of all time (even if you include compilations). Or at least they know the title track, that one tremendously evocative piece of \\"west coast rock\\" which threatens to overshadow everything else on the album. <br /> <br />If you think \\"Hotel California\\" is a bad song, you're a fool. Yeah, sorry about that, but it's the truth. This might not be your kind of music, but you have to recognize how tremendously well-wrought that song is, both musically and lyrically. It's not my favorite song, excactly, I'm mostly into blues music, but I still think it's an amazing piece of work, right up there with \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" and \\"Hey Jude\\". The partiture reads a classical chamber piece...at one point eight electric and acoustic guitars are playing at the same time! <br /> <br />Everybody has heard \\"Hotel California\\" so many times that they forget what an incredible musical achievement it actually is - but just listen to Don Felder's 16-bar solo immediately after the last verse. That has to be one of the greatest rock guitar solos ever committed to tape. <br />And while none of the other seven songs are as well known, the rest of the album is uniformly excellent as well. The other two singles were Glenn Frey's easy country-rock shuffle \\"New Kid In Town\\" and the hard rock stomper \\"Life In The Fast Lane\\", and while nothing matches \\"Hotel California\\", those songs would be the two shining highlights on any other album. <br /> <br />This album is less country and more mainstream rock than anything the Eagles had done previously, mainly because Bernie Leadon had been replaced with hard rock veteran Joe Walsh (who provides the main riff to \\"Life In The Fast Lane\\", and plays a number of sizzling solos), and the three-guitar onslaught of Frey, Felder and Walsh have arena-rock heft. The sound is big and vibrant, and while \\"HC\\" could have used one or two up-tempo songs to \\"make up\\" for the numerous slow tunes, you really can't say anything bad about these eight selections. <br />\\"Wasted Time\\" is a beautiful ballad, \\"The Last Resort\\" is a scathing political statement for which the Eagles also remembered to write good music. And Joe Walsh's mellow \\"Pretty Maids All In A Row\\" is a minor song only because it sits next to the mighty \\"Hotel California\\". <br />Randy Meisner's last Eagles song, \\"Try And Love Again\\" is a lovely mid-tempo rocker with a melodic country feel and some great ringing lead guitar by Glenn Frey, and the tough stop-and-go rocker \\"Victim Of Love\\" is equally excellent. <br />This wonderful album finds the Eagles at their peak. It belongs in any serious collection of popular music.
B000002UJQ|1.0|This is one of the worst records ever by one of the worst bands ever. Don't waste your money on this garbage. Just buy Synchronicity by the Police or Listen Like Thieves by INXS. Both bands and both albums are only about 300 times better than this crap.
B00005OM5L|4.0|Eric Clapton was touring behind the excellent \\"From The Cradle\\" album when this concert was recorded, and the set list includes a lot more genuine blues numbers than most latter-day live Clapton.    He is backed by an excellent combo which includes Andy Fairweather-Low and Muddy Waters' harpist Jerry Portnoy, and Clapton's own playing is delightfully gritty. He plays sizzling slide guitar on a terrific \\"It Hurts Me Too\\", and lets loose with a series of raw blues solos during Freddy King's \\"I'm Tore Down\\" and Eddie Boyd's \\"Five Long Years\\", and even pulls off a better-than-average \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\".  Eric Clapton's vocals are as good as I've ever heard him, and fans of his bluesier side should definitely pick up this fine concert video. DVD. Whatever.  This recording should have been released on CD...it is much, much better than the recent \\"One More Car, One More Rider\\".
B000002TQV|1.0|This album gave me the runs. Try buying something which doesn't suck like Achtung Baby by U2.
B00000D9TQ|4.0|The chief strength of this collection is that it puts almost all of Collins' biggest hits - including \\"Easy Lover\\", \\"Against All Odds\\", \\"In the Air Tonight\\", \\"One More Night\\" and \\"Separate Lives\\" - in one place. <br /> <br />It is not definitive...even though it weighs in at a very respectable 75 minutes, a few hits are missing, including \\"Don't Lose My Number\\", \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\", and \\"I Missed Again\\". <br />But for the casual Phil Collins fan, \\"Hits\\" is a very good collection, managing to include virtually all of his best-known songs. If you just want one Phil Collins disc, you can put this on your CD shelf and be done with.
B000002UR7|1.0|Radiohead have always managed to suck. Don't buy this if you want to go anywhere on the road of life! You might end up in Seattle and blowing your brains out like Kurt Cobain. Buy Vulture Street by Powderfinger. It's way better. Honk the gibson.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|What is the soul of a musical group? What is their identity, even as members and styles change over time? What is their worldview? I have asked this question about Dream Theater, a group I have been investigating for several months after being somewhat impressed with the Liquid Tension releases.<br /><br />The instrumentalists are virtuosos in their genre. (I doubt that any of them could play jazz, however, except possibly Mr. Rudess.) At their best, they can create driving, dramatic, intense, yet sophisticated music. That is what is appealing about Dream Theater. Their instrumentals shine. However, there is a heavy darkness in much their music, especially resident the lyrics--especially lyrics by Mr. Portnoy, who seems to use the music as a confessional of sorts. \\"Honor Thy Father\\" from \\"Train of Thought\\" is punishing, heart-breaking, and brutal. I nearly cry sometimes when I hear it. Mr. Portnoy may be speaking from desperate experience, but I do not know. The obscenity and the rage is painful. Mr. Portnoy also repeatedly writes of his problems with addiction. One may feel for him, even pray for him, but the effect is overly self-focused and depressing.<br /><br />Now on to this effort. Instead of making detailed comments on particular pieces, a few general remarks are in order. First, Mr. Petrucci is a world-class heavy metal/progressive rock guitarist. He plays with both speed and feeling. He is not a shredding machine. Therefore, he should have had more of a presence here, since he supercharges the music when he is let loose. Amazingly, several songs lack guitar solos entirely, even the more blistering ones where he would shine. Second, the lyrics alternate from sorry cliches (\\"The Answer is Within\\") to more dark protestations (\\"Panic Attack\\") and raging (\\"Never Enough\\") to tepid social commentary about September 11 several years late (\\"Sacrificed Sons\\"), to more desperate dark ramblings (\\"Octavarium,\\" which, once again [for some reason], brings up mental illness, as did \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\"). \\"Octavarium\\" has particularly disturbing sections where words are nonsensically thrown together. Insanity strikes once again. Why write like this? What purpose is served by it? Does one of the band members suffer over the insanity of a loved one? None of the pieces rise to the lyrical level of \\"Endless Sacrifice\\" (from \\"Train of Thought\\") with its sense of lament mixed with appreciation for someone willing to stick with a challenging, long-distance relationship.<br /><br />Musically, the recording alternates between harder, driving pieces and more pop/schlock sounding tunes. (Unlike other reviewers, I cannot compare the styles to other heavy metal groups, since I don't know of any to which they are often compared.) The ballads are rather insipid and prosaic if not embarrassing. Mr. LaBrie sounds better in the studio than live, but, nevertheless, he just gets in the way of the music too often. (And his screaming, heavy breathing, and hissing I could live without.) If the lyrics were thoughtful or searching or poetic, it would be another story. But they are not. Instead, they wildly alternate between the nihilistic and the utopian. Which is it? If \\"the answer lies within\\" why are is there a \\"panic attack\\" and lunacy at large once again? And why all the high-profile rage if \\"the answer is within\\"? Maybe it isn't within. Maybe it is somewhere else, somewhere higher.<br /><br />Nevertheless...there are a few good chops displayed in the better moments when the group speeds through their multi-layered intensities. Just don't attend this theater for a well-integrated worldview.ss, as did \\"Six Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\"). \\"Octavarium\\" has particularly disturbing sections where words are nonsensically thrown together.

B000002IQW|5.0|When I got this cd, I was surprised that it was a lot heavier then Skid Row's 1st cd, but after listening to Slave To The Grind and Monkey Business I realized that this was a landmark album for metal. It was the very very first hard rock/heavy metal album to debut at number one on the billboard chart the week that it was released. This c.d. proves that Skid Row was NOT a hair band. Monkey Business, Slave to the Grind, and Psycho Love,are few of the best that Skid Row has ever released. If you are any kind of metal fan you should buy this record. \m/(-_-)\m/
B000089RVX|5.0|Evanescence's music is unlike any other rock music. They blend the crunch of numetal with violins, orchestras, choirs, electronic sounds, pianos, etc.  It's just so awesome. Finally something new instead of the same old boring rock music. Well, here is a breakdown of there songs off of Fallen. <br /> <br /> <br />Going Under - Awesome opener. One of the darkest songs on the album with awesome guitar work and Amy really shows off her pipes here.  <br /> <br /> <br />Bring Me To Life - Who doesn't know this song? Yeah, it was a bit overplayed when it first come out in 2003, but hey, it's because it's that good, yeah! I still love it. WAKE ME UP!! <br /> <br /> <br />Everybody's Fool -  Great song with more awesome guitar work.  Gives a good message about how so many people are fake and not really what they seem and you gotta see the music video for this song. It is really inspiring. <br /> <br /> <br />My Immortal - Probably one of the most beautiful songs you will ever hear. I can't picture no one else singing this but Amy. Will always be an Evanescence classic. <br /> <br /> <br />Haunted -  Starts off with Amy kind of talking at first with errie and spooky sounds in the background, then the guitars just let loose, and at the end, hearing the choir in the background is just so awesome. Great guitar solo in here also. <br /> <br /> <br />Tourniquet -  Yeah, this song might be strange to some, but I happen to like it.  Of course, the guitar riffs are again awesome in this song, and this one song alone is probably what got so many people labeling Evanescence as a \\"Christian\\" band. <br /> <br /> <br />Imaginary - This happens to be the least favorite of mine. I don't know why. It just doesn't click with me. I do think the guitar work along with the violins is outstanding, but for some reason I just don't like it that much.  Enough said. <br /> <br /> <br />Taking Over Me -  Now this one is my favorite.  The piano that opens the song is so beautiful.  Then after, it goessuddenly with a hard crunch of the guitar with the strings and orchestra playing along. This song I think has the best melody, music, and chorus. I just love it. This is always on repeat in my cd player. I can't get enough of it.  Amy's voice really shines on this one. <br /> <br /> <br />Hello - Beautiful, sad song.  Similar to My Immortal, but I think this one is under rated.  Yeah, my immortal is good, but this one is also very good if not better. The song doesn't get played at any Evanescence concerts due to the fact that it is a tribute to Amy's sister that passed away at a young age. I don't blame her for not wanting to sing it. If she tried, she would probably break down or something. <br /> <br /> <br />My Last Breath -  Many consider this to be the \\"average\\" song of the record, but I think it's more than that. It's Evanescence, come on, it's not average.  It first opens up with a synthesizer, then the guitar comes crashing in with beautiful soothing strings/violins coming in blending together to make some damn good music.  The best part is when the dark part of the song starts when Amy starts singing, \\"Using your eyes to disappear, you pray your dreams will lead you there, etc.\\"  I love that part. It's just so gothic and dark. Awesome love song. <br /> <br /> <br />Whisper - And now, lastly, Evanescence finishes off there amazing debut album with this hardcore heaving moshing song.  The way the guitar starts off this song is so freaking unbelieveable.  It's so wicked.  The only part I kinda don't like about this song is towards the end where the choir is saying somethign weird.  Towards of loses me there, but o well.  Another awesome song by Evanescence.  Great way to finish off there solid album. <br /> <br /> <br />So overall, this album is truly amazing in every way. It deserves more than 5 stars.  I would give it like a trillion stars. lol  As I said, it is unlike any other kind of music out there right now.  It is a breath of fresh air like many say.Instead of the same old \\"pop, r&b, rap, hip-hop, Britney and Christina songs, lol,  we finally have something that isn't tiresome and boresome and that has been around and just common. I really think Evanescence is only gonna get better. We will see for sure when there new album comes out at the end of this year. Can't wait!  <br /> <br /> <br />
B000062YAY|5.0|Wow, I wasn't able to listen to this all in one sitting, but let me say that this was probably the best live album ever.  I've heard some SOAD live recordings that suck because the quality is so low, and it's just crap, but Slayer plays perfectly live, and it sounds great.  This has some really sweet songs also.  I love the fact that it's a 2 disc thing and not some cheap-o Linkin Park live in texas BS.  One thing that I didn't understand was that the end of some of the tracks is the opening for the next song.  Saying this I mean that say at the end of Mandatory Suicide Tom Araya will be talking and say something like \\"Now, here's the next song, CAPTOR OF SIN!\\" and the crowd will cheer, than the actual Captor of Sin track will start up.  Of course that's just and example, i'm not sure if those two songs are even on the same track.  I must say that you don't even have to be a Slayer fan to enjoy the energy and talent that's rockin' on these 2 cd's.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I bought this album the day it was released. i had just heard \\"speed of sound\\" before i bought it, so i was a bit apprehensive about the other songs. But the moment i played the cassette right from the first song of the album i was gripped by the music. Each song was like a breath of fresh air with a tinge of different fragrances. By the end of the last song of the album i was on Cloud 9.  <br />the album starts with \\" Square One\\" a fast & very adventurous song which reminded me a bit of U2's style of music. i loved the unique highs & lows in Chris martin's singing. <br />Apart from \\"square one\\" i simply got blown away by \\"A Message\\". This song is the best song of the album for me, it's so intense & powerful in it's music that i could'nt help being overwhelmed by it's music. The way the song ends with chris singing in his trademark voice & the beats in the background... it was an out of this world experience.  <br />If you liked \\"Clocks\\" then you will love \\"Speed of Sound\\" as it has some resmeblance to it.The song starts with a piano sound that was very similar to the one in \\"clocks\\". Other than these the songs that i liked are \\"Fix You\\", \\"Talk\\" & \\"What If\\". Rest of the songs also complement the album very well. Infact i listen the whole album in one go without skipping any song.  <br />I have heard all the three albums of Coldplay with \\"parachutes\\" being undoubtedly better than \\"A rush of Blood ...\\". But \\"X & Y\\" with it's adventurous music style has scored better than \\"parachutes\\". <br /> <br />Make sure you listen to these songs: <br />1. Square One <br />2. A Message <br />3. Speed Of Sound <br />4. Fix You <br />5. Talk <br />               I simply can't wait to see them performing these songs live in concert which will just exceed every limit of Nirvana.
0783217048|5.0|What would you think if three of your favorite male actors suddenly became...your three favorite \\"actresses\\"? Exactly, nothing because of how much shock you'd be in. Patrick Swazye, Wesley Snipes, & John Leguizamo star in this outrageously hilarious comedy entitled, TO WONG FOO, THANKS FOR EVERYTHING! JULIE NEWMAR. where Girls Just Want To Have Fun & Attitude  Is Everything. <br /> <br />    VIDA BOHEME (played by Patrick Swazye) & NOXEEMA JACKSON (played by Wesley Snipes) are two \\"girlfriends\\", who appear to be drag queens, competing in New York's \\"Drag Queen Of The Year\\" competition. Competing with Vida and Noxeema is the Latin-flavored, CHI CHI RODRIGQUEZ (played by John Leguizamo. Announcing the winner of the competion is RACHEL TENSIONS (played by RuPaul). Turns out, there is no winner. There are two winners. The winners are...Vida Boheme and Noxeema Jackson. Their prize is two all-expense-paid plane tickets to Hollywood, CA, where they will compete in the Drag Queen Of America contest. <br /> <br />     While walking up the stairs of their apartment building, Vida and Noxeema meet Chi Chi face to face. Chi Chi is upset because \\"she\\" feels that \\"she\\" is not pretty enough. They decide to take Chi Chi with them to Hollywood as their protege. They stop at a diner for some food, where Vida sees an autographed picture of Julie Newmar. The autograph reads: \\"To Wong Foo, Thanks For Everything! Julie Newmar\\". Vida takes the picture with \\"her\\" on their trip to Hollywood. They trade in their tickets and buy a 1967 Cadillac Convertable and head out on their way.  <br /> <br />     On the way, the \\"girls\\" stop in Bala Cynwood, PA, Vida's hometown, where they stop outside of Vida's old home, where \\"her\\" parents are still residing. His mother looks out, becomes ashamed, and turns around. A little spiff sturs up between Chi Chi and the others, leading them into informing Chi Chi that \\"she\\" is not a drag queen, but just a little Latin boy in a dress. They pretty much name \\"her\\" a drag princess, having to go through four steps of becoming a full-fledged drag queen. <br /> <br />      Late that night, they are pulled over by SHERIFF DOLLARD (played by Chris Penn), pulling them over for a broken tail light. He takes Vida out of the car and begins feeling \\"her\\" up, until Dollard feels a little something more than he should have felt on a real woman. Vida knocks him out, where she and the others flee the are in a heartbeat. <br /> <br />     They pull over into a rest stop, get changed, and head out on their way, but their car won't start. Chi Chi wants to leave, but the others won't let \\"her\\", forcing Vida to take Chi Chi's Princess Points from passing the first two steps. That is when Chi Chi decides to hitch hike. Hitchhiking should be easy since Chi Chi claims that, \\"...I'm the Latina Marilyn Monroe. I got more legs than a bucket of chicken...\\" Chi Chi finds a ride with BOBBY RAY (played by Jason London). He is a resident of Syndersville. They pick up Vida and Noxeema, and head out to Snydersville. CAROL ANN (played by Stockard Channing) and VIRGIL run a boarding house, where Virgil is a mechanic. Virgil will start work on their car in the morning, while the \\"girls\\" spend the night. The next morning, the whole town is outside, looking at the three queens. Virgil reveals that the car won't be finished until the forthcoming Monday, forcing the three to remain in Snydersville over the weekend. <br /> <br />      In this town, they meet, BOBBY LEE (played by Jennifer Millmore), who is Carol Ann and Virgil's daughter, BEATRICE (played by Blythe Danner), MERNA (played by Melinda Dillan), CLARA (played by Alice Drummond), who befriends Noxeema, since they love the old films from the 1940s, LORETTA (played by Beth Grant), and KATINA (played by Marceline Hugot). Vida befriends both Carol Ann and Bobby Lee, where Chi Chi falls for Bobby Ray. During the afternoon, Vida and Noxeema help the girls plan their strawberry social for the next morning. <br/> <br />     That night, Bobby Ray goes to ask Chi Chi to the next morning's strawberry social. Bobby Lee is upset at that fact, since she is also in love with Bobby Ray. Chi Chi and Vida argue bitterly about it, until Vida goes upstairs to stop a fight between Carol Ann and Virgil, for Virgil is abusive. Vida gives Virgle his own medicine and kicks him out, where Carol Ann, Vida, and Noxeema celebrate with each other for Vida having done what \\"she\\" did. Chi Chi decides that it is more important for Bobby Lee to be with Bobby Ray, where Vida and Noxeema let Chi Chi know that \\"she\\" has just passed step 3. <br /> <br />     The next day, Sheriff Dollard and Virgile enter Syndersville and plan to arrest the drag queens, but the town covers for them. They have their strawberry social, and they are on their way to Hollywood, after the car is finally fixed. Chi Chi wins the Drag Queen Of America contest. Presenting the award is...JULIE NEWMAR (played by Herself). <br /> <br />     This movie had me laughing my a** off from start to finish. Patrick Swayze was not that great in this film, but luckily, Wesley Snipes and John Leguizamo were the ones to help make the picture a laughing riot. Most people have reviewed this movie as garbage. Those people are afraid to say they liked because of how most people can be judgemental over others who like this movie, just because of three guys only dressing this way for the pay of the movie. Let me tell you that you don't need to be a woman to like this film. If you like this film, whether you are male or female, then you like this film. There is no difference. Man or Woman, you have right to say you like this film.
B0007DAZW8|5.0|I had my doubts about this CD until I realized that it is an intentional joke. Its over the top and cheesy on purpose. Don't take it so seriously. Go back to Homework and listen to \\"Oh Yeah\\". Its a techno song making fun of other techno songs... on a techno record. Can't you see the humor in that? Its cynical.  <br /> <br />Having a vocoder loop singing about \\"Emotion\\"? Having a vocal loop singing \\"Steam Machine\\" that sounds like steam? Robot vocals to \\"Human After All\\"? And the kicker is using \\"Technologic\\" to advertise for Apple. Are you really supposed to take this album seriously? No, but don't judge it on just a few listens, either.
B0000B1OFL|1.0|I went to watch this film with a few friends of mine when it came out. I must say I disliked the film to the extent I was waiting for it to end. It's one of those movies which try to show off skill and grit but in the end fall flat in the face due to lack of originality.<br /><br />The movie might seem unpredictable to the new lot of teenage kids and people who are impressed quite easily.I'm random so pardon me but this movie like many other films example Ocean's Twelve etc. failed to derive any sort of entertainment for me.<br /><br />It's not like this is the worst movie I have seen but I didnt like anything about it.I dont understand why all my friends loved it.The humor used is very filmy and thin.I believe there's Italian Job 2 coming out. I wouldnt watch it if I were paid to do so.<br /><br />Watch some more deserving movies instead,<br /><br />Example - Casino,Heat,Goodfellas,Ronin
B0009MAO46|5.0|I was so HAPPY when they announced a re-release for this DVD. I was happy for many reasons. <br /> <br />1. A great movie, DISNEY/PIXARS 1st moive <br />2. I didn't get a chance to buy the 1st release, or the BOX SET <br />3. Has lots of great features!!! <br />4. It will be a two disc!!!! <br /> <br />Let's hope rumors are ture that they are going to re-release TOY STORY 2 by the end of the year. I will also be buying that!!! <br /> <br />Can't wait till Sept. 6!!!
B000003TAW|4.0|I would love to give this cd 3.5 stars but I can't so I will just give it the benefit of the doubt.  When it came out, it was sweet and catchy.  The problem now is that they should have had better quality recordings.  I love the cd, but it seems that they could have made the sound quality a little more clear and all that good stuff.  Weezer may suck now but this cd is just about as good as they got.
B000022TSH|5.0|\\"Chinatown\\", staring Jack Nicholson, is the quinessential Los Angeles detective story.  Over the years some more recent films, such as LA Confidential and Mulholland Falls, sought to redevelop the same themes.  Both, in my view, failed to live up to the high standards established in Chinatown.  Chinatown begins with an interesting plot :  the woman who had arrived in his private detective office turned out to be someone other than the person he thought.  The original woman had wanted to spy on her husband to see if he was cheating.  The actual woman had never met the character played by Jack Nicholson.  From this twist early in the movie, all other events follow:  Nicholson uncovers a plot by the Department of Water and Power to divert water stream flows to an area in the  Valley, whose developer is intending to reap extra profits from purchasing the land, quite cheaply, and being able to sell at a profit once knowledge of the irrigation supply that will be provided to the Valley will be made public.
0670033375|2.0|There was obviously someone awake in the sales department when coming up with the title of this book but it really was not as scintillating as I had hoped.  Collapse starts out kind of slow, with some rambling on about Diamond's experiences in Montana, before it gets interesting.  The middle section is decent, concerning societies that have collapsed and the various reasons why and then the end gets kind of preachy, about what we can do to save-the-spotted-owl and that sort of thing.  For those who have read \\"Guns, Germs, and Steel\\", Diamond's exhausive (and exhausting) statistic-laden writing style will be familiar but, if you have not read his earlier work, don't pick up \\"Collapse\\" expecting a white-knuckle thriller.  It is really more of an academic tome than popular reader.  In all, I think many people will be duped into expecting more excitement from \\"Collapse\\" than it delivers.
B0006L16N8|1.0|Woe is me.  Woe is Chris Martin.  Woe unto all who buy this album...     This album will likely mark the beginning of the end of Coldplay's success in Europe.  Unfortunately, however, it will only heighten the popularity of the band's following in the U.S.  This album is not at all good - it is unimaginative and continually borders on cliches and tired \\"already been done (by Coldplay! incidentally)\\" themes.    I have become resigned to the undeserved success of Dave Mathews, Rob Thomas, John Mayall etc etc, all of whom use a canned approach to \\"soft rock.\\"  But Coldplay produced two GREAT albums.  X&Y is rubbish.  Don't waste your money.
B000000W5L|5.0|Ah, the Stones at their best is, arguably, Mick Taylor at his best.  This may be the finest and the worst hour for this band (it has certainly been argued both ways) but no doubt about the power of \\"Ventilator Blues\\", the ONLY Stones song to which Taylor was given a writng co-credit.  It's certainly his lick and it's as hot,sweaty,Delta Blues swampy as the Stones would ever get in their career.  Taylor was one of the hottest and most technically proficient lead guitarists of the time-Jagger and Richards have admitted as much in recent interviews-and songs like \\"On Down the Line\\" let him stretch out a bit with his searing slide guitar attack. He added a dimension of fluidity in his guitar style that the band lacked prior to his arrival in '69 and never had again after his departure in '75.  Sadly, his solo career has been spotty but has shown brilliance in the few offerings he has made.  I realize this is all a bit narrow in focus, but so much has been said already of this album and the songs which folks are all too familiar with that,well, I just wanted to see the guy get some credit for what is clearly the sound most of the public readily identifies as the Stones and to what a tremendous degree Mick Taylor contributed to it.
B0001Z36PK|4.0|After Regeneration came out a couple years ago, people complained that he had changed his style. If fact almost everything we loved about Divine Comedy had changed. His fans were disappointed. I was too. It wasn't horrible, but it wasn't what I wanted. I heard that Neil was disappointed that his fans didn't want to follow the new direction, but he also decided to return to the tried and true sound which made him famous in the first place. <br /> <br />This album is a return to form. He's still got it. It's got the orchestration, it's got the literary references, it's got the wit... it sounds like The Divine Comedy. It's not as good as Liberation or Casanova, but maybe he's just getting warmed up again... <br /> <br />Anyway, there are tracks on this that are as good as anything he's ever done. The Happy Goth is definitely the best track on the album and I would say one of his best to date.  <br />
B00005NKKZ|5.0|This album was the most successful in the career of Simon and Garfunkel, deservedly so. They had recorded plenty of great music before this but the overall strength of this album puts it ahead of their other albums. Curiously, the title track was the only UK hit from the album although it made number one. In America, the album yielded four hits, these being the title track, The boxer, Cecilia and El condor pasa (If I could).<br /><br />I've heard various stories about the origin of the title track. One story is that a bridge in Tiverton (Devon, England) inspired the song. Another story is that the song is not really a love song at all but is actually about drugs. I've listened very carefully to the song and I eventually realized that this is possible (the drugs, rather than a lover, being the bridge) but I, like nearly everybody else on this planet, will continue to regard it as a love song. It is, of course, one of the finest love songs in popular music history.<br /><br />With such an impressive title track, you might expect it to overshadow the rest of the album but this is not so. Quite apart from the three other American hits, the album also includes Keep the customer satisfied and Baby driver, both of which must surely have been considered for release as singles, as well as a live version of Bye bye love (acknowledging one of their main influences, the Everly brothers) and some other interesting but less famous songs - So long Frank Lloyd Wright, The only living boy in New York and Song for the asking.<br /><br />This classic album deserved all the success that came its way. Many of these tracks have appeared on compilations down the years, but the original album (now re-mastered with improved sound quality and bonus tracks) stands on its own merits.
B0006L16N8|2.0|I was a coldplay fan since their first album was released,but maybe not anylonger after listening to the new album twice. The only word that can correctly express myself is disappointed. They seem to have lost all their musical ispiration to making any breathtaking ballads.There is NOT a single song in XY can surpass or even meet the height of the first two albums. X&Y is more like an easylistening album than a rock album with \\"depth\\". The lyrics are just forgetable. I tried very hard but still can NOT find a highlite in it. DOn't want to say anymore. <br />Disappointed
B0007GAERG|4.0|Hat's off to Mariah Carey for finally getting her act together and producing an album that is worthy of her vocal talent.  Since the release of 1999's \\"Rainbow\\" her vocals went from powerhouse, knock your socks off to this whisper Janet Jackson crap that is completely beneath her.  Time and again I complained that she needed to return to her roots and bring back that big voice everyone was so familar with.  Six years later she did just that and that's why this album has sold nearly 2 million copies as of this review.  The only reason I don't give it five stars is that it's a little too R&B for my taste, however be certain to check out \\"Stay the Night, Circles, and Fly Like a Bird,\\" in addition to \\"We Belong Together.\\"
B00097A5HW|2.0|En mi opinion , este disco es, en verdad, un poco mejor que la desilusion que fue el disco 'laundry service'...pero todavia me parece que la 'verdadera' shakira ya se desaparecio. Hay muchas artistas que pueden crecer , cambiar tras los anos pero sin la perdida de la raiz o 'identidad' de si mismo.  A mi me parece que la shaki es en realidad una persona que lo trata de esconder pero quisa no esta contenta en su propia piel...no se tal vez su 'self-esteem' esta de un nivel muy bajito...y por eso cambia todo de si mismo desde su pelo hasta que colocarse en las mismas filas desvestidas de menos talentosas como britney spears, cristina aguilera, paulina rubio etc...me encantaba los anos antiguos cuando shaki se puso el esfuerzo en ser completamente different a las otras artistas ...este differencia la hizo algo nueva , frescante y unica,especial- y la hizo exitosa!!! Ya lo lamento pero esta solo dos pasos fuera de convertirse en una gringa (al estilo Michael Jackson?) , solo le falta aumentar los pechos perfectos y ponerle los contactos de color...y viola! , no quedaran ni raiz latino...que lastima....  <br /> Bueno, en fin..si les gustaba 'laundry service' , probablemente les van a gustar este disco...esta un pocito mejor <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000777J2S|4.0|I love this album.       Antony rolls his vocals with a lovely, dramatic execution.   (It sounds like he's swallowing his voice while alternating his notes/octaves.) These lyrics are ripe with contemporary pain and overcoming.        This is one of the few albums I can listen to every day and still be moved by the songs.         Rufus Wainwright joins Antony in a very short track on this seemingly incomplete album. Other guests include Boy George and Lou Reed.      These songs-- they are strangely original and powerfully emotive. Track one (\\"Hope there's Someone\\") is especially beautiful; it's one of the most heartwrenching songs I've heard in years. It's like that beautiful kind of aching that some songs make you feel, as though you've been cut by a familiar blade. My Lady Story is the best overall song.     If you listen to \\"Hope There's Someone\\" with good headphones, alone in the dark, you might even be moved enough to shed a few tears.     I value this album at 4.5 stars. If it boasted a few more songs, then the talent of this band could easily earn 5 stars album after album. This music fills a gap in today's music, and it does it quite well.     This type of music is not well-suited to all, (like Coldplay and Modest Mouse seem to be). But those who do love this won't care about ubiquitous radioplay, because they will be reeling from the intense aethestic grandeur of this album, of Antony's tremulous, soulful vocals.     I'm tempted to say that their self-titled debut album is better, but it really isn't superior. They are different, but equally majestic.
B0000AUHPK|2.0|The reasons I only give this movie two stars. <br /> <br />1: In the beginning when mr lockwood went to wuthering heights, he got stranded there due to a snow storm. In the movie though they made it a thunderstorm. That change to me made no sense. <br /> <br />2: The character casting was alful. I didn't think one charater in the movie was casted good. <br /> <br />3: The movie didn't flow very well, And unless you read the book or know the story it will be very hard to follow. <br /> <br />I would not recommend this movie, The 1939 edition was better. <br />The book was great.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay has once again proved that they are one of the best bands in the world right now. This cd is absolutely amazing, and outshines Parachutes as well as ATOBTTH. I dont care what anyone else thinks, this is their best work so far. Every song is good, and there is 13 of them. 13 great songs make this cd a triumph. If you even remotely a coldplay fan, pick up this cd. You wont regret it. I bought it tuesday, and i havent listened to anything else since. I've been waiting for this cd for years, and i must say it was well worth the wait. Dont listen to the horrible reviews that people are making up. This cd takes a couple listens to appreciate, because it is pretty long, and each song sounds different. People who are giving this cd less than 4 or 5 stars have voiced their opinion, but I do not agree with them. Just listen to it, and see for yourself. Its worth it.
0783235380|2.0|If you've seen one you've seen them all. Uptight guy by chance meets quirky girl, she brings him out of his shell. <br /> <br />Well, I bought this for like two dollars, and maybe it was worth it. I watch it like once a year. No special features on DVD worth mentioning. <br /> <br />Ben Affleck is getting married, he has to fly down to the south from NY for the wedding. But things keep getting in his way. Forces of Nature. Also, he keeps running into, and can't seem to get away from, some weird chick (Bullock). Are these signs? Should he stop being so uptight, and go with this free-spirited chick? Or should he be an adult and get married and accept his Vanilla lifestyle? <br /> <br />The acting in this movie is \\"meh\\", meaning Sandra has the same personality that she has in every movie; and Affleck sucks, as usual. The other small parts are well done, for the most part. <br /> <br />The script is formulaic, and the cinematography at times is interesting. It's just another rom-com where the whacky girl brings the uptight guy out of his shell. The movie opens with a stripper scene, no nudity. There is also a pot-smoking scene in this movie. There is also a scene where Affleck strips at a gay bar. Just thought I'd throw that in, in case you're considering buying this for your teen daughter or something, and that kind of thing bothers you. <br /> <br />You only need to buy this is you are a rom-com fanatic, or a big fan of either Affleck or Bullock. Otherwise this is completely forgettable. <br /> <br />
0887306667|5.0|The \\"Laws\\" couldn't be laid out any clearer or any more concisely. Some of the info is a little dated (the book was written in '93), but the philosophy remains sound.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is Coldplay's finest work. A solid 10/10!!! Best CD of 2005 by far. If you're uncertain, go listen to it on AOL Music. It's great. <br /> <br />STANDOUTS: <br />Square One <br />What If <br />White Shadows <br />Talk <br />A Message <br />The Hardest Part <br />Twisted Logic
B000050FEN|5.0|When the sins are committed from two in two you have to pay them from one in one; Rudyard Kipling was the author of this singular statement. This film became the great leap of David Fincher to the big screen. Original script that deals with a serious damaged mental  man, who bets to be God and choosing every victim according every one of those kidnapped codes. But beware the religious fanatic  can become heretics due precisely, to his own fanaticism.<br /><br />Seven capital sins: seven crimes that must be done to clean the world from the stinkers and vicious human beings. In this chrysalis and under those extreme prejudices you can not expect too much sense of the reality. And Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt will be the investigators who will be assigned to chase this lunatic and out of his mind man. Excellent shots, brutal and extremely graphic violence, but superbly fascinating.<br /><br />One of the most original and best films in these decade.<br /><br />The plot was a true circular nightmare as it was inspired by the astonishing mind of Jorge Luis Borges or perhaps a sincere homage to William Blake!
B0006L16N8|1.0|I loved Parachutes, liked Coldplay's second album, and have nothing but disdain for X & Y. It's simplistic and boring and gets old by the second or third listen. It's waaaaay over-produced, and the lyrics sounds like they were written by a third-grader doing his first poetry assignment. There are a lot of great new albums out there, and some of the hyped ones deserve it (for instance The White Stripes). But this effort by a talented band is truly disappointing.
B0009QBLA8|4.0|I just finished watching this movie 4 the first time and ummmm.. well.  It is David Lynch!  At times I wonder what substances this guy is on in order 2 get his ideas!  This guy is either a genius or a LOON!  That fine line is more fine in this guy.  This movie is about... actually in regular David Lynch style.  U have NO idea what the movie is about yet u are drawn 2 it.  Basic premise:  This guy has a strange coiffre!  So u think... THINK that is the Eraser!!!  OH NO my lil friends!!!  He is sort of a recluse.  He comes home and his sexy neighbor (brunette) says someone called 4 him.  he goes over, odd family, finds out he may have fathered (possibly not even a baby) with an ex... g/f or friend, or,,, SOMETHING.  Now get the mind of David Lynch here.  Henry is in the house and the father of the g/f or friend says he has something special 4 dinner, they are the \\"Newest Thing\\", MAN MADE CHICKEN!  As he brings the handmade chicken out he tells this story about his arm and the Dr's said he would never be able 2 use the arm again BUT he rubbed it every single day for 1/2 an hour.  He could use the arm now but it is numb and he is scared about cutting it and asks Henry to cut these teeny chickens up 4 the family.  This cooked cornish game hen moves and starts 2 spew blood A LOT of blood, not cuz the chicken was undercooked it shot out about 2 cups of blood!  Then blah blah blah u see his \\"g/f\\" or whatever feeding this... \\"THING\\".  This offspring is wrapped in bandages and resembles a small Velociraptor but no body.  Thing just cries, but has signs of intelligence cuz it did not wanna eat food and spits it out.  Then this woman sings on the typical David Lynch stage (Drooping curtains and the black and white patterned floor that is common in his movies.  This movie is LOVING death and Heaven.  It is very industrial with huge metal clanging noises dabbled with the lull of storms and rain.  These \\"worms\\" are crushed by this woman that could be attractive sans the \\"growths\\" on her cheeks as she sings this thing about heaven and arms held in tight, and constantly wearing a smile. Then a dead tree bleeds, a head pops off, a kid gets the head before a homeless guy does, takes it 2 this shady place, and u see where the \\"ERASER HEAD\\" comes from.  Without giving the end away I will say this:<br />It is strange, it is David Lynch, I have no idea what this is really about, and yet... I am gonna purchase it!  DAMN U DAVID LYNCH!!!!!!<br /><br />I would LOVE 2 meet this guy!on her cheeks as she sings this thing about heaven and arms held in tight, and constantly wearing a smile. Then a dead tree bleeds, a head pops off, a kid gets the head before a homeless guy does, takes it 2 this shady place, and u see where the \\"ERASER HEAD\\" comes from.

B00003CWPL|1.0|I saw this around 20 years ago, possibly on late night cable.YIKES.I still have not gotten that \\"baby's\\" cry out my head !It is worse than a train wreck because before you realize it-- you have watched too much of it (trying to figure it out/ BE THE FIRST to understand it---which will not happen).If you find consentration camp clips OR movies of misery or snuff films \\"enjoyable\\".......well I guess you COULD find this movie funny.
6305971153|5.0|Kids will love it, I know I did and I still do!
B0006L16N8|5.0|This new album is amazing ! It was the first Coldplay album I've ever bought, and I want to other ones now ! They are so goodd !! Everybody should get it, + they have a hidden song ! Every song is good and some are very good lol ! Yay 4 Coldplay ! 10/10 !
B00005K9LK|5.0|Nothing to say, but....if you don't already have it......GET IT!!! Shame on those that don't own it!!!!! Buy it NOW!!!!!
B00007E8V4|4.0|I find Steal This Album to be a really boring cd. There's about 5 good songs on here, which would be (from best to worst) ADD, Boom!, I-E-A-I-A-I-O, Chic 'N' Stu and Innervision. <br />The rest isn't really innovative at all and it's lost the creative touch found on the band's first cd.  There's nothing close to Sugar on here. <br />This would probably be system of a down's worst cd not only because of the lack of good songs but the lack of originality. \\"SOAD\\" had Sugar. \\"Toxicity\\" had Prison Song. \\"Mezmerize\\" had BYOB. But there's nothing creative on here to keep me coming back, if you take out the 5 songs I mentioned I wouldn't be able to tell the difference between any of the remaining songs except the terrible \\"36\\". <br /> <br />The only reason I'd get this is to complete my S.O.A.D. collection. Get Mezmerize, Toxicity OR THE GREATEST ALBUM ON EARTH, \\"SYSTEM OF A DOWN\\" [self titled]. These guys have potential and they didn't use it here I'm sorry.
B0006L16N8|3.0|Ok... I like this album, but then again, I'm waiting for Coldplay to progress towards something new; a different sound. I am a big fan of Rush of Blood to the Head - that album is out and out beautiful in the way that it reaches both emotional highs and lows, and the self-titled \\"ROBTTH\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\" cap of the album leaving me wanting to replay the album again.. <br />However, I don't have that same feeling for X & Y. Part of me thinks that because most everyone is giving this album 5 stars is because they've never heard any other Colday.. and that's a shame, sorta. <br />I totally believe that Coldplay achieved much much more with Parachutes and Rush of Blood.. I give this album more like a 3.25, maybe 3.5 <br />...And if anyone would like to argue that Coldplay is Europe's greatest band of this age, YOU, friend, ARE WRONG. You're forgetting/ or never even delved into the greatness that is RADIOHEAD. Here's 2 must-have albums - OK Computer, and Kid A !
B000021YQV|5.0|Toxicity is a very good album by System of a Down but it's a huge disappointment for me after hearing their debut album. That cd was much more chaotic, fun, and the guitars were much better, there's nothing even close to \\"Soil\\" on here. Daron's riffs seem so much more monotonous and boring on here, which can easily be heard on songs that start out heavy like \\"Jet Pilot\\" and \\"Deer Dance\\" and in the choruses of songs like \\"ATWA\\" and \\"Forest\\". <br />On a more positive note this is a little more concentrated than the debut, there's nothing like \\"Mind\\" on here which really was a waste of a 6 minute song. During the quieter parts and such the guitar playing is good, as seen in \\"ATWA\\" and \\"Chop Suey\\" which isn't something I can say as much about the debut. <br /> <br />As a conclusion I'd say this is a good first album to get for System of a Down, either this or Mezmerize which shows the band is really good but not in full force like the debut which I recommend getting by all means, but you won't appreciate it if you don't get this first.  <br />Best songs here include Prison Song, Chop Suey, ATWA, Science and Shimmy, the other 2 singles aren't bad either but not as good
B0000CF300|5.0|Ignore the other reviewer who obviously can only handle the GC lite-country stuff. This is Gene Clark's masterpiece, and like anything great it takes a few listenings to grow on you. This is cosmic space-folk-rock for anyone who likes Dylan-style poetic imagery and CSNY-type music. If you've never been to the desert and plucked a few cactus buttons, you may not get this mystical, sad, haunting but ultimately uplifting record. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|Coldplay has taken it a step further this time with far more elaborate arrangements and production. Loaded with a kaleidoscope of orchestra, layered guitar and synthesized backing tracks that put one into an somber dream state. Flowing melodies that capture upon the first listen, become endearing after repeated plays. Dream pop at its finest, at its best.
B000068OCS|5.0|The technical side I can't comment on and the Glass music was a little dated. But I love this film and its obvious theme and not so obvious sub-themes. <br /> <br />I saw K last night for about the third time over the last 15 years or so. This time I was blown away by the abstract imagery in the movie that I did not see (clearly at least) the first two times. Particularly the first 20 minutes or so. Just select a scene at will and push the pause button. Squint you eyes and many beautiful landscape compositions appear.  <br /> <br />Some of these reviews suggest the first part of the film was slow - I thought it was incredibly moving - beautiful streaming organic natural images set up to underlie and contrast with rectangular and linear man-made images later in the film. <br /> <br />Another stunning and connecting example of natural/man made image is the nose of the aircraft coming toward us - an intense complementary blue/orange abstact landscape painting. Wow. <br />  <br />Experiment with clicking the fast forward button for the middle section. Accelerates the chaos and exaggerates the point of the film. <br /> <br />Oh man - I love this film.
0446310786|4.0|<br /> <br />This book (To Kill A Mockingbird) is amazing. End of story. <br />Read it. Now.
0060005696|4.0|This book aims to explain that Americans literally get too many options for their own good and it accomplishes that goal admirably well.  The book is at its best, however, when it relates how the human mind operates before, during, and after making a decision. <br /> <br />Schwartz spends about half the book laying out the ways in which each of us conciously or subconsciously compare ourselves to others, get accustomed to new levels of fortune or misfortune, and constantly seek to improve our lot even when it no longer behooves us to do so.  The ideas he lays out are excellent for improving your own approach to life or to help you understand what drives other people. <br /> <br />Highly recommended for people who enjoy social-sciences and the often irrational workings of the human mind.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This CD was so strong I have ordered the other 2 CD's they have made.  As an old progressive rock person I think ColdPlay is the best band to come around in about 15 or so years.  If you want excellent music in the progressive style purchase any of Coldplay's CD's.  I promise you will be amazed.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|Need I say more?  Well, I will anyway.  I, at first didn't want to watch the movie production, only, because I was so moved by the voices of the original cast and didn't think this would live up to it.<br /><br />But, I was wrong.  In my opinion, the beautiful scenes, the sensual beauty of the actors, the music score, make this almost a perfect movie.<br /><br />The visual opportunities that a movie can create as opposed to a stage play has its own wonderful merits.<br /><br />I had to view this movie as a separate creation and try not to compare, but to enjoy and emerse myself in the lusciousness of this production.<br /><br />Gerard Butler is sexy, sensual and has a genuine sensitivity in his roles such as the Phantom. Also, he's a very MANLY hunk and he sure can sing! (whew!... is it hot in here)? I'd really like to see him act in more roles, and musicals in the future.<br /><br />Actually, all of the cast were wonderful, all with beautiful voices.<br /><br /> Even though Minnie Driver may have been dubbed for singing I still think she was absolutely delightful in her Diva role. She steals some scenes.<br /><br />I am still humming the tunes!!!<br /><br />This is on my #1 list, of number one favorite musicals.
0553802534|3.0|This is a well-written and suspenseful book. Unfortunately, it is based on the  premise that in order to disarm a man holding a gun, the police sniper has to shoot him in the head,instead of taking out his gun hand, and/or his knees, etc. This bothered me a lot and detracted from the story. The original situation was not set up so that the sniper really HAD NO CHOICE BUT TO KILL THE MAN. If this is the way real sniper teams operate, then it is too bad for us.
B00097A5HW|5.0|I have been a Shakira Fan for years & years! And for that reason I can be one of the biggest critics because FANS we expect a LOT from her and let me tell you: This CD is everything and more! Shakira involves all her music influences, experiences, imagination, creativity, feelings etc on this album! It is so diverese and yet so Shakira! So fresh and New yet it has Shaki's soul all over! Each song brings me a different feeling.. from \\"Entre Tus Pupilas\\" which makes me fly away & feel dreamy.. to \\":La Pared\\" which makes me feel energetic yet poetic! ..La Tortura...makes me want to dance!... \\"Obtener Un Si\\".. wow the quality of this song.. Jazzy & beautiful .. \\"NO\\" her voice here.. her chords.. the lyrics! I can keep going on and on but you must experience this CD on your own and please forget the HIps, the looks, the previous Cd's , the expectations and just let Fijacion Oral Involve in its world!
B000929AJQ|3.0|I could swear that I heard this album about twenty years ago, and that shortly thereafter, this guy named Trent came along and released a debut album that showed the world how pop-industrial should be done, and then released an even more remarkable followup, and then gradually slid into a parody of himself.  The Terminator films have nothing on this album with respect to time paradoxes.<br /><br />Two words, four syllables: \\"With-uh teeth-uh.\\"  I can't help it: a large percentage of this album reminds me of nothing so much as late, way-past-their-prime INXS.  For the most part, this album is bland, boring, redundant, and lyrically inane.<br /><br />And yet, there's the closing track, \\"Right Where It Belongs.\\"  While it's a good song to begin with, something happens right at the three-minute mark -- in the middle of the last verse -- that isn't quite like anything I'd ever heard before in popular music.  It's ingenious and moving and so sonically effective that my jaw still regularly drops when I listen to it on good speakers.<br /><br />Buy or don't buy?  I can't tell you.  I can't quite attest that I got my money's worth, but I really do love those last five minutes.

0385512104|5.0|YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY READ THIS BOOK!!! <br /> <br />This book is about a boy named Christopher. Christopher, on top of being a teen, and not having a mother, has autism, a spectrum disorder.  When Wellington, a neighbor's dog is murdered with a garden fork, Christopher is determined to catch the dog's killer.  The chapters are numbered using only prime numbers, because it is told by Christopher, and Christopher likes prime numbers.  Between the tale of the murder mystery, Christopher lets you in on what it is like to have autism, and how you just can't really trust people.  I can relate a lot to Christopher's point of view, despite that fact he has autism and I don't!   <br />    <br />  Haddon is a great author, and deserves some sort of award.  He is really great!     <br />    This story has seventy-trillion ways you can look at it, and you have to love it, no matter which way you choose.  In fact, this book deserves a million stars, not just five! <br />
1400032717|5.0|Meet Christopher Boone - an autistic teenager.  His favorite colo r is red and he despises anything yellow or brown.  He lives with his father.  And he's just decided to solve the mystery of Who Killed His Neighbor's Dog.   <br /> <br />The story is much more than just a simple whodunit, however, and the mystery really takes a back seat to the many uncomfortable and complicated truths that Christopher finds as he investigates the crime.   <br /> <br />More than just a mystery, the story is a coming-of-age tale of a teenager in England.  Christopher has a father, who he lives with.  His father is obviously very dedicated but is only human and has a whole bunch of issues to deal with himself - not the least of which is raising an autistic child with no mother around to help.     <br /> <br />Were this story not told in first-person POV, we might feel sorry for Christopher.  But his rational decision making ability, combined with his very real (though sometimes unrealistic) dreams and aspirations make him understandable and complex.   <br /> <br />I won't reveal any of the plot points that deal with the mystery because the investigation is a real joy to read.  It is also very funny at times.  It's also sad in parts, too, usually when the reader understand more about the situation than Christopher does.   <br /> <br />I recently re-read this book and was delighted with the way Mark Haddon has created such a wonderful and totally believeable story.  This is a great read and one that will not disappoint.
B00003CXD5|5.0|I watched \\"The Wages of Fear\\" last night which was largely about vagabond Europeans in a South American country.  It  reminded me of \\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\" in many ways; the vagabond \\"whites\\" in the Third World, several men who are down on their luck take a chance on making some big money, the riches gained were lost due to their inability to cope with what they had gotten.  Both movies were excellent but my deference still leans to \\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\" for a number of reasons. <br /> <br />The direction is excellent in both movies but my nod goes to Huston for doing what a director ought to do best; make the most of each scene to tell the story.  There was so much meaning in each step of the movie that we were able come to know the characters without having it all spelled out.  Clouzot (in \\"The Wages of Fear\\") did well but needed 30 minutes more to accomplish the same results. <br /> <br />The acting was also terrific in both movies but the trio of Holt, Huston and Bogart was in a class by themselves.  Tim Holt essentially played the straight man to Walter Huston and Humphrey Bogart.  Walter Huston won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar that year and deservedly so.  However, the star of the show is Fred C. Dobbs played so well by Humphrey Bogart.  To witness his gradual descent into the cesspool of greed was certainly deserving of an Oscar as well (no offense to Laurence Olivier but who watches his \\"Hamlet\\" these days)?   <br /> <br />Finally, there's the script.  Both directors got involved with their movie's script but Huston had a better act to start with.  It was through the book by the same name that I got acquainted with the author B. Traven.  His was and remains a brilliant perspective on the corruption of man by the influence of an expanding society (in other words, he's an anarchist).  The focus was on greed in \\"Treasure\\" and it culminated in a closing scene that put everything in its' proper perspective.  \\"Fear\\" tried to do the samebut stumbled somewhat in the process. <br /> <br />Both movies are worth seeing but \\"The Treasure of the Sierra Madre\\" is a movie I stick with each and everytime I come across it while channel surfing.  It is a classic of American Cinema.
B00005JKJA|4.0|It has been established beyond a reasonable doubt that David Lynch is a pretentious boor, and aside from artsy effects and fancy camera angles, most of his films lack Significance.  Muholland Drive is the exception.  Unfortunately, it is also his most misunderstood work.  It starts with an attempted assassination foiled by a freak accident, then cuts to a surreal vingette, then proceeds as a classic \\"film noir\\" thriller for the next hour or so, before suddenly spinning out of control in a whirlwind of confusion.  I began to think that this was some more artsy silliness, but then the unthinkable occured -- it all came together and began to make perfect sense!  This film is about the choices people make, and how each choice can potentially create a new reality.  Classic Quantum physics (which I believe to be deeply flawed) postulates that literally hundreds of alternate realities are co-existing side by side (BS), and this film shows us about a half-dozen such realities -- and what happens when the barriers between them are partially lifted.  Added to the mix are a number of demi-god type entities masquerading as humans in order to physically interact with those they seek to influence.  Most of Lynch's films are notable only for a handful of good scenes -- this one was good nearly all the way through.  Impressive!
B0006L16N8|3.0|I have to concur with many here ... I too am a big Coldplay fan, but would not be had X&Y been their first instead of third release! I keep trying to like it. I keep wanting to like it. I keep listening to see whether I missed something. <br />But truth is, apart from a smattering of highlights, \\"Twisted Logic\\" being among them, this CD neither captures nor inspires. Unlike its predecessors, this CD will get short playtime, I'm afraid. I won't give up hope entirely. Maybe they'll come around with their next CD. If not, then it'll be a 2-CD career for Coldplay.
B00005YU1O|3.0|I enjoyed this film, but after the second viewing it began to get a bit tedious, and I don't think I'll be watching it again.  The animation technique used creates a haunting effect -- brilliant.  The philosophical rants range from genius to inane babbling, with a lot of mediocre stuff in-between, so I had to deduct a star for pretentiousness.  The take on the phenomenon of lucid dreaming was great -- some inaccuracies were noted (\\"light levels\\", etc.), but the best stuff is left unsaid, and comes across subtly.  I'm not going to pick it apart with criticism -- yes, it could've been better, but it was an enormous undertaking -- they used a different team of animators for every scene, and it is obvious that a huge amount of time and effort was expended to produce something unlike anything that has ever been done before.  Everyone should see this film once.
B00097A5I6|5.0|some mixed reviews for this cd but heres one from a real oasis fan...if u like oasis and have all their cds..u will no doubt enjoy this one...Liams vocals are better here than on \\"heathen chemistry\\"...which was still good i dont see why people diss that cd it was much better than \\"SOTSOG\\"....one complaint on this new cd is that freaking noel sings 3 or 4 songs...come on now...Liam IS oasis....noel's \\"part of the queue\\" and \\"importance of being earnest\\" are pretty good tho..but still.......ok 'importance of being earnest\\" has one badass guitar solo in the middle..but still...Liam shold sing....anyway ignore the crappy reviews on here from people who dont appreciate Oasis or good rock and roll anymore...Oasis is just overshadowed by the rock-pop crap we have these days.such as the overplayed lame 3 doors down, no doubt, alterbridge, etc....only song that sucks is \\"mucky fingers\\" and \\"meaning of soul\\"...all the others are great particularly ' turn up the sun\\", \\"lyla', \\"love like a bomb\\", \\"a bell will ring\\"
B0002NRRAG|5.0|This is one of my most favourite CD's.  I can't stop listening to it over and over. I particularly like this CD as it has a great selection of tunes covering all tempos. The band is wonderful and Madeleine has one of the most unique soothing voices I've ever heard.  I bought 3 copies as gifts and all the recipients have fallen in love with this CD.  It's a winner!
0671027344|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky is by far my favorite book. This is the story of what it is like to be in high school and to grow up. Charlie the main character in this book writes his thoughts emotions and experiences in letters. This book can be described as a diary or journal. It discuses his experiences threw the topics of sex, drugs, love and the Rocky Horror Picture Show. This story was good because the boy Charlie was growing up then and I am growing up now and he was the same age when he wrote all this stuff. Also some of the stuff is similar to what i do or some of my friends do.
B0000DZEE3|5.0|This DVD is just awesome - the only thing better would actually be there in the crowd - what an unbelievable night they must have had.<br /><br />I agree with other reviews in that the concert is very 'tight' - the sound is spectacular. Anthony's energy comes through into your lounge room and Chad's drumming is faultless. Flea rocks and John is great.<br /><br />Seriously, all producers of concert DVDs should look at this as a benchmark in sound quality and vision - the only thing closer is being there.<br /><br />Also, to make up for lack of extras, it is worth getting the Greatest Hits dvd - with the tour doco etc.<br /><br />It is great to know that a band can continue to rock as they do - let the fun continue!!
B0006L16N8|4.0|Mello, Smooth sounds from Coldplay.  Wonderful Cd, highly recommended and a great follow up to Parachutes and Rush of Blood to the Head.  Get it!
B0006IIPIK|2.0|As a rapidly aging fanboy, it pains me to write this, but I wasn't crazy about this movie like I wanted to be.<br /><br />Now that the dust has settled, it's clear that Sky Captain has not taken the world by storm. In fact, it can be looked upon as not just a disappointment but a box office failure. The critics didn't go as gaa-gaa over it either. I had to wonder why. It sure seemed like it would hit it out of the park but after finally seeing on Sunday, I've got some idea what happened.<br /><br />1. The script. Yeah, 'fraid so.  Writer/director Kerry Conran may be a visionary, but a wordsmith, he ain't. (Sound familiar, Mr. Lucas?) The characters were mostly flat, the dialogue didn't crackle (this is not a quotable movie) and the jokes fell flat, the worst of which being the stupid and inappropriate line \\"Cold air makes nipples hard.\\" Yuck. Sure there were lots of ideas bandied about in the story but there was no real focus . It doesn't build. It just kind of...happens.<br /><br />2. Film references. Sure they're fun when they are few and far between, but it seemed like almost every scene needed an asterisk for the footnote below. Tarantino almost did in Kill Bill the same way. Maybe it's my problem. I get all of the references and I find it distracting. It's really time to give The Wizard of Oz a rest.<br /><br />3. The lack of a decent villain. The Olivier stuff was so underdone, it comes off as just a conceit, like Fred Astaire dancing with a vacuum cleaner.<br /><br />4. Jude Law. He looks great, just like the movie itself, but he's too soft-spoken and, as a result, doesn't come off that heroic to me. And I may be killed for saying this (oh, what's one more thing...) but why was Sky Captain a Brit? I really think this character should have been an All American guy, unless it all took place in England or London instead of New York. And what is it with this guy anyway? Chris Rock was right on the money. For awhile, he was in a movie a week. Sky Captain I Heart Huckabees, Alfie, Closer...I hear he's a porter on The Polar Express too. Who does he think he is... Ben Stiller? Don't get me wrong. I like Jude Law, certainly a lot better than I do Colin Farrell, but he didn't pull this character off for me. He seemed more like Leslie Howard. I didn't want Ashley Wilkes saving the world. I wanted Rhett Butler in a pilot's uniform. And while we're at it, less Gwyneth Paltrow and more Angelina Jolie...<br /><br />5. The CGI. It is wonderful. Whatever works in this film is due to the brilliance of the effects. However...(okay don't spit on your screens)...I think it's overkill. Too much, too soon in the early stages left me almost yawning by the end. It seemed to be less of a movie and more of a demo reel. In fact, I think it would have made a great short subject. Stretched out to a full-length feature, the seams started to show.<br /><br />Okay, I've dumped all over this movie and I feel rotten about it. I really do. There's nothing I would have liked better than to have embraced it and championed its cause, to chide those who make cah-rap like National Treasure popular, but ignore the fine work of an emerging new talent. But I can't. Chalk this up as a noble failure. Not awful, but not great either. It falls into that middle ground somewhere and that's kind of like Purgatory. I do think Kerry Conran should be given another shot to strut his stuff, but for God's sakes...give him a collaborator next time. He needs guidance. Otherwise, he'll end up in the Where Are They Now? column next to the director of Tron..I hear he's a porter on The Polar Express too. Who does he think he is... Ben Stiller? Don't get me wrong.

B0007OCG4W|1.0|This is one of the most appallingly bad movies I've ever seen.  Four shallow and selfish people treat each other badly in various ways.  That sums up fairly well this entire miserable film.  It's a superficial film that tries to pretend to be \\"deep\\" but ends up with absolutely nothing interesting to say.  Even the critically-lauded acting performances in this film are really nothing special.  Boring characters go around and around in utterly meaningless and pointless relationships in which they manipulate each other selfishly, and in which nothing of any interest happens or is revealed.  Some reviewers have praised this film for its supposedly very realistic portrayals of real-life relationships.  To those people I would like to say, if this is what you think real life is like then you've got some BIG problems.
6305212112|5.0|Don't get me wrong, I LOVE AND ADORE THIS MOVIE. I concur with all the revies below, and I think it's one of the best movies ever made! <br /> <br />I just want to add one thing: I still own the Laserdisc (the THX-Signature-Extended-Edition), which has a dolby-surround-soundtrack. The first release of this movie on DVD a couple of years ago also had the same sound transfer. When now this new release was announced by amazon finally with a 5.1-encoding, I ordered it right away (a couple of days ago). Yesterday I received the package and checked it out right away, only to find out that amazon's 5.1-advertisement was misleading. The movie still has it's original 2.0-encoding. I decided to stick to my laserdisc, because when it comes only to dolby-surround-sound, no DVD can beat a laserdisc. Nevertheless I really hope that Universal will put out a new release of this beautiful movie in the near future, for I think that a 5.1-soundtrack will truly add to the movie's emotional climaxes and will enhance every upcoming viewing experience a lot! <br /> <br />Oh, not to forget my request to amazon to correct the sound-encoding for this DVD to avoid any further misleadings for other customers. No 5.1 digital sound, only 2.0 dolby surround sound. - Thank you. (- writing to you from Germany.)
B000063DGC|5.0|This is the -only- live album where I like the performances better than what was recorded in the studio. <br />This live album is on fire, the energy captured here is incredible and the guitar player tops the solos that he originally did...I'm stunned.   <br />If you are curious about ozzy's early solo career...buy THIS album first.
B0009S4IHY|5.0|Ever since JURASSIC PARK we have seen an ever-increasing amount of CGI use in movies, all trying to make the impossible realistic, culminating in the LORD OF THE RINGS trilogy, the ultimate creation of a fantasy world.<br /><br />But, Stephen Chow shows us that CGI can be used to create impossible UNREALISTIC situations. In SHAOLIN SOCCER, and again in this movie, he creatively spices up his wacky world with musical numbers, breathtaking fight sequences and just plain fun use of CGI.<br /><br />The way that CGI was meant to be used. To elevate the realistic to the impossible, Not making realistic what will never be.
B000002LPD|2.0|The first VH album I ever bought was 5150 followed by 0U812. I then went backwards enjoying the DLR albums as well. This album is -not- what I wanted to hear next.  It has taken me -years- to come back to it and I still don't like what I hear.  There are a few good songs to be found on this album...but my least favorite VH album for sure.
B0009AM5JA|3.0|For an admitted period of time, Coldplay have been one of the most influential and interesting bands of the time, their debut record 'Parachutes' was a breath of fresh air from the endly Radiohead, and Oasis impersonators that seemed to be permeating the genre. Listeners couldn't help but be swept up in the hype, were they the 'next big thing?' would they soon be challenging for position as 'biggest band in the world' ? <br />The answer in the last few albums has become rather resounding, while the music in itself is not poor, in fact it is quiet listenable, with nice tracks such as &quot;Square One&quot; and &quot;What if?&quot;. With equally grand songs as &quot;Square One&quot; and &quot;White Shadows&quot; being played. The album has nice tempo changes, moving from a nice slow pace, to a more uptempo beat. However in all the machinations of the album, one cannot help but see how terrible formulaic the reality of composition is. <br />Coldplay has found a middle of the road that seems to work well for them, and is travelling it perfectly, the album while good in itself lacks any sort of experimentation, innovation, or change that generally sets apart a brilliant cd, from a merely mediocre album. The album is like the diet coke of albums, neither is it so horrible that one would pick it up and immedietly wish to throw it in the closest rubbish bin, yet it is startingly lacking in terms of actual artistry.
B000002LEU|4.0|This is an interesting CD.  <br />We see the development from the 1977 Warsaw version to the 1980 Joy Division version of the group and what a difference. <br />It starts out with \\"Warsaw\\", which is a very Stooges inspired affair and one of the first recordings they did and ends up with \\"These Days\\", which is one of the last recordings they did. <br />Inbetween this it's a mixture of obscure and well know tracks like \\"Love will tear us apart\\" and \\"She's lost control\\". <br />Of the obscure track from the Warsaw period, \\"Leaders of men\\" and \\"Failures\\" impress because they, inspite of being very different from the Joy Division material, have an energy that's unresistable not unlike Stooges again. <br />The conclusion will be that the material from the Joy Division period are far more original, but the other tracks are worth hearing also if you're interested in hearing the development of this great band that is.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Her performance at the MTV Movie Awards last night was stunning...Whew, the voice is back(even though it never left)..This album is something special and is quickly becoming a classic...
B000002G30|2.0|I bought this album on the strength of \\"Negasonic Teenage Warhead\\" which I think kicks major <br />butt!! However after listening to the whole album, nothing else even comes close to the energy <br />of that song. If you are looking for more of the same, you too, may be disappointed. I'm not a <br />stoner, so maybe I am missing something in this music. I was able to get this through the Amazon <br />marketplace for a couple of bucks, so I just think of it as the purchase of a really long CD  <br />single :).
B0006A9FMI|3.0|Anyone that complains that this movie is bad because it isn't dubbed should have their ears checked. 99.9% of dubs are painful to listen to. <br /> <br />Now, the subtitled could be better.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|This CD is awesome but almost every time Daron takes over, I cringe.  Serj of course is back to his excellence. Can't wait until the next one! <br />
B0000CABBW|5.0|When you go to the video store looking for films with positive role models for kids (and adults!), with an inspirational message that you can accomplish something if you put your mind to it, you typically will find almost nothing.  Worse, even movies with a fraction of a positive message will be so silly or idiotic that watching them as an adult is torture.  With \\"Whale Rider\\" you get a movie that adults and teens (and many pre-teens) can both watch and enjoy.<br /><br />As Roger Ebert pointed out in his review of \\"Whale Rider,\\" something is horribly wrong with a ratings system that gives a movie like this a PG-13 rating.  Just watch this next to a movie like \\"Dodgeball\\" with its objectification of women, toilet humor and sexual innuendo.  Both movies have the same rating!  Don't be fooled.  The average 12 year old _should_ be watching \\"Whale Rider\\" while \\"Dodgeball\\" shouldn't be viewed even by 14 year olds.  All of this has me wondering about about the sanity and intelligence of the ratings board.<br /><br />As many have pointed out, Keisha Castle-Hughes puts in a superb performance.  Ditto for the rest of the cast.<br /><br />Perhaps even better than the performances are the positive roles played by most characters.  The kids are intelligent, confident and curious.  The adults are generally supportive and wise.  While the males in the movie have obvious faults, this movie is about them as it is about \\"girl power.\\"  There's a scene where Keisha's character is riding a bike with her grandfather and a loving glance passes between them.  How rare it is to see such imagery - a father figure bonding with a child - in movies or TV!  \\"Whale Rider\\" isn't just about celebrating a girl's empowerment.  It's also about showing the love between male parental figures and their own personal growth as their children mature.<br /><br />One caveat: \\"Whale Rider\\" is not typical Hollywood popcorn fare.  Viewers with short attention spans or those who hate all foreign film style filmswill likely not like this movie.  Still, \\"Whale Rider\\" is an excellent start to open the eyes of a youth (or an adult) to ideas outside of what the studies usually throw at us.<br /><br />Bottom line: We'd all be better off if we had more movies like this.
B000929AJQ|3.0|This album is probably the most consistent of NiN's work, there is only one or two songs that I like or dislike more than the rest. Sadly, on  With Teeth this is not a good thing. Trent has said that this was going to be a lyrically oriented album, sadly, his lyrics are cheesier and more cliched than normal(not to mention they're basically synonyms of the lyrics on  The Fragile). And he does the whole \\"repeat same thing over and over again to end the song\\", which while interesting on  The Downward Spiral took a dramatic turn for the worse on  With Teeth since the thing he repeats is usually the chorus(unlike on  TDS) and he does it on 90% of the songs instead of about half of them. <br /> <br />Now, as for the music, it is surprisingly bland for a NiN album. Most of the songs are overly dominated by drums that sound like many different ways of playing the very well done drum line on \\"Eraser\\". Sadly these not only aren't as well done as on \\"Eraser\\", but it is on most of the songs so it gets boring. The bass plays catchy little lines that are sometimes complimented by guitars that sound the exact same as on  The Fragile, making  With Teeth probably the least progression in between two of Nin's albums(despite being the longest wait). Also many of the effects on this album are just sad rehashings of  TF and the  buildups(something that happens quit a lot on this album) are all topped by \\"The Fragile\\"'s buildup on  Still. <br /> <br /> <br />Trent Reznor uses the new technology like a kid in a candy shop, having(I think) 4 vocal lines in some songs and using tons of loops, buildups and otherwise odd effects that are one of the few things that evoke interest in  With Teeth when compared to other NiN albums. Sadly, if you want super large amounts of production like this, buy Radiohead's  Hail to the Thief, for it not only has that, but is better in basically every way possible. <br /> <br />Overall,  WT is interesting for a few listens, but not something I would spend money on. <br /> <br />Overall,  WT is interesting for a few listens, but not something I would spend money on. <br /> <br />Overall,  WT is interesting for a few listens, but not something I would spend money on. <br /> <br />Hey look I ended it like a Nin song!
B000929AJQ|4.0|This album is AMAZING, don't get me wrong, but this is nothing compared to the power and emotion put into Downward Spiral.  Their first song on the CD, \\"All the Love in the World,\\" is a pretty slow techno ballot, that is overall a decent song, but somewhat shows a transition in their style of music.  \\"You Know What You Are\\" is probably one of the best songs on the album, probably because its most closely sounds like some of the older NIN.  \\"The Collector\\" is mostly a filler, which is something that NIN usually doesn't have in their albums, but its not bad.  \\"The Hand that Feeds\\" was their debut single, and what go me interested in their new sound, but it got overplayed even I purchased the album.  \\"Love is Not Enough\\" is an interesting song, because it sounds like a clash between his newer style and his older style.  \\"Every Day is Exactly the Same\\" is probably the best song on the album in my opinion; it most closely runs tangent with the Downward Spiral style, and sounds the best too.  \\"With Teeth\\" as really good lyrics, despite its slow rhythm.  \\"Only\\" doesn't even sounds like NIN, its sounds very odd, because it sounds like a pop rock song, not industrial or like NIN at all.  \\"Getting Smaller\\" is an awesome burst of energy that comes right during the slower part of the album, so its great to hear when you hear it, as well as seperate from the album.  \\"Sunspots\\" is another song in his new style, and is fairly decent, the chorus is a little dry.  \\"The Line Begins to Blur\\" is an awesome song once you REALLY listen to it, the lyrics are fantastic, and the song is great, but you have to somewhat grow used to it.  \\"Beside You in Time\\" is another slow song, but very good.  \\"Right Where it Belonges\\" is a really good slow ballot, and a great closer to the album, but a hidden track or some other sort of extra version of a song already on the album would have been great to have.  If you get the dualdisc version of it, there are some pretty cool features and things to watch on the DVD, and for only a few dollars more you can get that, so its great that they offer that on this album.on the DVD, and for only a few dollars more you can get that, so its great that they offer that on this album.
B00008AWOG|5.0|Still Life sees Opeth hitting a style of death metal that is so original, odd and perfect that it can only be called a work of genius. They manage to orchestrate every part of every song to sound practically folkloric, with the super heavy guitars combined with Mikael's vocals sounding as much like a folk song as the slower parts. I'm not sure how they do it, but something about how great his death vocals are, and how well the instruments are played/produced just gives it this eary medieval feel. Something orchestral death metal bands like Dimmu Borgir have tried to do, but Opeth do it without even having the orchestra. <br /> <br />Compared to their other albums,  Still Life is slowed down a bit, as well as having more accoustic parts(and they either go full out death metal, or completely quiet accoustic, none of the clean vocals over heavy guitars like on  My Arms, Your Hearse). Truly a masterfully put together and performed album, I highly suggest any fan of metal, or even music in general check this out.(Even if you don't like metal... Opeth were the first badn with cookie monster vocals I ever liked)
B0009A1AS2|4.0|If there is one band on the planet that has defined there sound on changing their forumula evertime they go into the studio, this is the band. This time around its no exception. <br /> <br />With their previous release TOT, the first listen was extremely alientating because of the massive change made to the bands sound, this album is no exception. The first listen turned me off, I was very shocked by the extreme they decided to experiment with; but as with TOT (train of thought) the second listen really reveals the genious of this album. <br /> <br />This is probably one of the most stunning DT releases in years. It is both heavy, but can be extremely light. With the intro \\"The Root Of All Evil,\\" which is the third track in the AA (alcoholics anonyimus) series, it opens on a very solid Alice in Chains influenced rocker. The one thing that may turn fans off from this track is the lack of a seven string guitar which has been the center piece of the rythm section for this continuing story, but none the less its a great opener. <br /> <br />The four tracks to note on this album are \\"I walk besided you\\" which is a masterful Coldplay influenced love song, that rates up their with awakes \\"Lifting Shadows Off A Dream.\\" The song is probably the most accessible on the album and might be the first real attempt at DT attempting a mainstream song. Expect to hear this one on commerical radio.  <br /> <br />The second track is \\"Panic Attack\\" a buzz saw shreder, where petrucci and portnoy show off the metal roots once again, in an almost new-metal fashion. This song is both heavy and edgy, sporting some of the best written lyrics Petrucci has done in a very long time.  <br /> <br />Next is \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" which is a nice moderate 6/8 piece which displays some of the best progressive elements this band has put together in years. Lyrically it's in the same continum as TOT's \\"In the Name of God\\" and is just as well accomplished. From it's Iron Maiden harmonies, to its more edgy keyboard arrangements this is a definately a track you'll find yourself listening to over and over again.  <br /> <br />Lastly and certainly not least is the title track \\"Octavarium,\\" a 24 minuet epic in the vein of \\"A Change of Seasons.\\" This song is incredible, with seemless transistions and plays on many of the greatest progressive rock bands of the 70's, but even with these older influcnces this piece is simply timeless. From the emotionally impacting lyrics, to the insane arragements of the instruments this simply one of the best tracks DT has done EVER!  <br />  <br />With this album, the main things to note, is Rudess taking the forefront of the lead section, and displaying some of the best written keyboards this band has seen in a long time. With Petrucci standing back a little bit and not being so shred heavy, Rudess has the room he deserves to show his great contribution to the band.  <br /> <br />Also is James LeBrie's singing, which definately blends and sours in some of the best DT songs that have been released in years. His emotion impacts every track with an absolutely stunning fashion, whether it be his strong balading in \\"The Answers Lie Within\\" or screaming frenzy that would make Danny Filth jealous at the end of the title track \\"Octavarium\\" he defintatly adds to the artistic value of this incredible set list.  <br /> <br />As stated before this Cd will take multiple listens before you are comfortable with the arrangements and can see the masterful performances that have been put together on this album; but once you have you will find that a stripped down DT with tight arrangments works just as well as the more complex arrangements that have comprised their previous works.
B0001NBMBC|1.0|Well... I did it... I downloaded a Slipknot album... <br /> <br />\\"Prelude 3.0\\" - This sounds like a horrible attempt to imitate Tool's slower stuff, except his voice sucks and has no emotion, the drums are boring and simple and the guitar is basically just playing a few high pitched notes over and over again. I assume this was supposed to be some kind of buildup or something... it was pretty lame. <br /> <br />\\"The Blister Exists\\" - DEAR GOD THE DRUMS SOUND HORRIBLE, THE NOISE THEIR BASS KICK IS MAKING MAKES ME WANT TO RIP MY EARS OFF. At least it distracts from terribly screamed vocals; boring over distorted guitars; and lyrics that sound like they were stolen exactly from Nine Inch Nails's \\"I'm so great I own you die die die\\" songs... and the singing is probably worse than Trent's too. I got 2:19 in before skipping to the next song. <br /> <br />\\"Three Nil\\" - Three = number of songs so far, Nil = Number of good songs.(I'm so witty...) For having *NINE* members and being able to hear both guitar parts clearly this is the most boring music ever. I made it 1:40 into this one... I could probably scream better than their vocalists. <br /> <br />\\"Duality\\" - he says 'then I'll go away' in this song... I hope that happens soon. Worst clean vocals ever. (1:40 into this song too before I heard about all it had to offer) <br /> <br />\\"Opium of the People\\" - Aww, that was a pretty cute guitar solo to start off the song. Oh wait, then it started sounding like all of their other songs.(40 seconds) <br /> <br />\\"Circle\\" - Wtf, I already heard \\"Duality\\", is this a different song? This is like emo with less musical talent and emotion.(45 seconds) <br /> <br />\\"Welcome\\" - Hey look, it sounds like all the other songs. (20 seconds) <br /> <br />\\"Vermillion\\" - Sorry I don't really like Korn, skipped. (50 seconds) <br /> <br />\\"Pulse of the Maggots\\" - I got bored of the mob chant at the start and went later on into the song, which ended up sucking more than the intro. <br /> <br />\\"Before I Forget\\" - I really got bored of them by this point and this song really had nothing new to offer. Some mallcore bands at least change their lyrics to keep each song at least mildly different. Slipknot found a synonym book for the words \\"I'm trapped\\", \\"I'm awesome\\" and \\"I'm breaking free\\". <br /> <br />\\"Vermillion Pt.2\\" - Listen to Mudvayne's \\"World so Cold\\" it is infinitely better than any attempt of Slipknot to be emotional... and I don't even like Mydavayne <br /> <br />\\"The Nameless\\" - This song lasted almost 15 seconds without sounding like all of their other songs. <br /> <br />\\"The Virus of Life\\" - I'm deeply confused by this song.... <br /> <br />\\"Danger - Keep Away\\" - Wtf he's still trying to be emotional and sucking.
B00097A5I6|4.0|I just wanted to focus a bit on each song: <br /> <br />Turn Up the Sun- Jangly tambourine opening followed by a slow middle.  Doesn't really go anywhere till the instrumental, rolling, gazing melodic guitars kick in.  As another said this could've been replaced with a better opener. 2.5/5 <br /> <br />Mucky Fingers- Dylan with a constant beat and harmonica.  Noel even duplicates Dylan's vocals with \\"It's all mine!\\"  Some dynamite harmonica piercings in the middle.  Dylan does Dylan better, but Noel does Dylan pretty well. 4/5 <br /> <br />Lyla- Maybe the second best rock radio play behind U2's Vertigo.  Kind of a stomping return to glory for early Oasis fans.  Outstanding middle guitar work, and the way the outro slows into a jam and then swells psychedelically is memorable. 4/5 <br /> <br />Love Like A Bomb- Lovely declaration by Liam with plenty of muscle.  Filled with thumping drum beats, rolling middle guitar, and touching piano flourishes.  Liam's forceful vocals carry this through.  This is dedicated to his significant other. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />The Importance of Being Idle- The most odd and progressive thing Noel has created in ages.  Some fabulous touches with Noel's out-of-place high-pitched vocals, carnivalesque piano, and grab bag antics.  A celebration in weirdo sarcasm. 5/5 <br /> <br />Meaning of Soul- The rockiest number on the album.  Maybe too short for its own good.  Great beat that gives the song a *jump* and *shuffle* feel all the way through.  Liam's macho swagger really carries this.  You'll be clapping and stomping as Liam brings the heat on this one. 4.5/5 <br /> <br />Guess God Thinks I'm Abel- The country side of Lennon.  The backing \\"Ahhh...\\" is taken from trademark Beatles vocals.  Explosive eye-opening outro seems out of place.  \\"Songbird's\\" cousin.  Quaint and endearing. 4/5 <br /> <br />Part of the Queue- Noel's turn on this melodic rocker.  Excellent rhythm and drumming.  Piano follows Noel's lead nicely.  Radiohead's \\"Fitter, Happier\\" is stolen in the middle.  The song builds to a pinnacle and echos out. 3.75/5 <br /> <br />Keep the Dream Alive- Lovely electric guitar riff accompanying Liam's tender side.  Liam's chorus is pushed up in sound.  Some excellent heavy guitar work that swells then falls into a fade. (The stunning starkness of the guitar work just before Liam's \\"na na na's\\" is a high point.)  Liam's 'declaration on life and love' theme is starting to slightly grate, but very good nonetheless. 3.75/5 <br /> <br />A Bell Will Ring- Some more good heavy guitar work with thick drums.  One too many Liam declarations and this one finds its way into stagnant predictability.  That doesn't mean it's an entirely bad song, though. 3/5 <br /> <br />Let There Be Love- Tiring, cliched, and predictable Beatlesque flag-waiver (everything from the hand claps to the Lennonish piano to the building orchestration), but Liam's touching vocals really carry this (particularly on the word \\"SKY\\").  Though not entirely bad (again due to Liam's vox and the Gallagher's seemingly expertise in the Beatles catalog), it is made worse by the fact it is the concluding song, and yet another unnecessary F4 attempt.  As another review said, \\"I'd like Oasis to sound like Oasis.\\" 2.5/5
B00008WG3U|1.0|You know what these guys can do. Replace a C with the N
B0009A1AS2|2.0|First off, let me say that my favorite type of music is progressive metal. I USED TO love Dream Theater. Images, Awake, COS's, Metropolis Part II are by far their best albums with Met. PII being the greatest concept album ever (along with Queensryche Operation Mindcrime)To be honest with you I can deal with Falling into Infinity, there are some quality songs on that album including Trial of Tears, Anna Lee, etc. However, after Falling Into Infinity and Met. PII, Dream Theater Fall OFF. They take a different, very bad, direction. Six degrees is a horrible album and for the most part so is Train of THought. I believe it has something to do with Ruddess. THis guys a great keyboard player, but c'mon. It's obvious he has been the dominating force on the past three albums and has made Dream progress in the wrong direction. <br /> <br />Now onto my album review. I've been waiting for this album for a LONG TIME and wanted to listen to the album a few times because DT does grow on you with each listen. However, I'm not pleased with the results. I can sum up this album in a word: \\"Eh\\". It's alright. It's definitely not their best and definietly not their worst either. It's average at best. Anyone who says that the 24-minute epic is better than Change of Seasons is LYING TO YOU. 24 minutes are wasted completely, with only about 5-7 minutes of quality music. So with that song being worthless the rest of the album really falls short. There are some parts of some songs that are great and that's about it. Glimpses of greatness, without a whole song ever being great from beginning to end. <br /> <br />With this album I have jumped off the Dream Theater Band Wagon and have jumped on the best prog metal band out there: Symphony X. You want to hear a 20+ minute song that will blow away even the mighty Change of Seasons listen to The Oddessy from the album with the same name: pure genius. These guys pick up where Dream Theater started to go wrong. The Oddessey and V: THe Mythological Suite are the best prog metal albums out there in the past 5 years. Plus their vocalist Russell Allen puts LaBrie to shame.
6301973410|5.0|In this true, heart warming story about a very unselfish mother who would do whatever it took to win the love of her oldest child; the greedy, too good for it all, ms Veda.(Ann Blyth)Mildred Pierce, (Joan Crawford) gives women the name that we deserve.  Though there were a few times when I would have slapped the daughter right upside her snotty little attitude, Mildred Pierce teaches us that a mother would do anything for her own children, yes, even work as a waitress and bake pies for a living.   <br />Joan Crawford deserves the Oscar Award that she won for this 1945 film.  I would have given it to her just for simply putting up with Academy Award Nominee Ann Blyth who played the stuck up Veda.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|first, one reviewer stated that everyone else that has reviewed this seemed to forget that Shadows cannot \\"scream\\" anymore because of a vocal chord surgery.  Well my freind, if you are so certain he will never scream again, how do you supposed they will do thier old songs live? have another band member do them? well if i remember, i read an article that stated (by the band) having another member do them just wouldnt be the same ole avenged sevenfold...so they dont do them on this album, but they will do them live? i dont know. also i heard that Shadows actually can scream, just not in over-excess, i mean if his belted out singing on this album does not hurt him then some screaming may be alright.  Anyways what im getting at, is avenged using this surgery as an excuse to branch out and do something they wanted to do, without fully admitting it to the public and thus being labled \\"mainstream\\"? will they just play screaming tracks electronically for the live shows? will someone else scream? either way A7X wont be the same. now to the album. like everyone else said basically, it is good, but nothing spectacular...but if this band helps get the screamo losers who love a static lullaby, atreyu, from autumn to ashes, and all that other crap to get to love real metal, then im all for A7X being lumped into those metalcore screamo generes anyways.  There is much better metal out there than this....but dont me wrong, it is fun to listen to.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I had been anticipating X&Y for a long time just as so many other people have. I heard the single \\"Speed of Sound\\" and was somewhat impressed with it seeing as it was also reflecting the rest of the album to come. I bought the album the day it came out and listened to it and realized it was going to have to grow on me a little bit more than their previous work. And after listening to it 20 something times here and there this week I have realized how amazing an album it is in a much less aparent way than their previous two. I can truly see how more advanced, developed, and full their music is compared to three years ago and before. I strongly believe that Coldplay is a  band with universal appeal that is driven by some of the most incredible talent and skill the world has ever seen. I believe they are unmatched by all but a small number of other bands. As a musician and an obsessive music enthusiast, X&Y affirms my belief in the band. Some of my favorites off the album include; \\"A Message\\", \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\", \\"The Hardest Part\\", \\"White Shadows\\", and \\"Twisted Logic.\\" The hidden track written for Johnny Cash tited \\"'Til Kingdom Come\\" is excellent as well.     In spite of this, all I can think about when I listen to X&Y is that Coldplay can do much better. From the day it came out I was already looking ahead to the 4th record.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Oh so close. So darn close to perfect. I have been anxiously awaiting Coldplay's followup to their critical masterpiece,  <br />\\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" (RBTTH). It is so very close to perfect, but I did expect a little more. The only thing it lacks, is more standout tracks. \\"Parachutes\\", their first effort and \\"RBTTH\\" both had lots of standout tracks, and this one only has a few. \\"Parachutes\\" had 'Don't Panic', 'Shiver', <br />'Yellow', 'Spies' and 'Trouble'. \\"RBTTH\\" had 'Polotik',  <br />'In My Place', 'The Scientist', 'Clocks', 'Warning Sign' and 'Amsterdam'. <br /> <br />But the only standout song I noticed on \\"X&Y\\" was their first single, 'Speed of Sound' <br /> <br />Who knows? After a few more times through it, I may like it more. <br />It took me a little while to get used to \\"Parachutes\\", but when I did, it was in my CD player wherever I went. With \\"RBTTH\\", I was instantly hooked and I have never let go. It is almost always in my 3-disk changer. Maybe I'm just being impatient, but \\"X&Y\\" does not immeditaly jump out at me. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, this is a wonderfully crafted masterpiece, it just....is lacking in a few places. But it does have lots of good tracks. I really like tracks Y1, \\"Speed of Sound\\", and X3, \\"White Shadows\\" but I have fallen in LOVE with track X4, \\"Fix You\\". I LOVE this song. It's very sad and melancholy, and Chris Martin's beautiful falsetto is lonely, and haunting.  <br /> <br />If you liked \\"RBTTH\\", you will love this CD. I definetly recommend this CD if you are a Coldplay fan, or if you are just a music fan. It really IS good. Just not quite perfect. But it does leave more to be said. Maybe on their next CD, Coldplay will reach perfection, and I look forward to it.
B00004SVID|5.0|this live cd is awesome. My opinion, \\"The Wall\\", has to be Pink Floyd's greatest album ever. And I really wanted to buy that instead, but God it is expensive! So i saw the live cd at wal mart for only $15 ($32 for the wall studio recording) and i said what the hell, it cant be that bad. Usually i hate live cds because the sound sucks, but this is just great. The quality is exelent, Roger sings the song great but goes soft on a few tracks, (on the second track, he hardly hits the compassion he has on the studio cd when he starts singing.) but overall great album, I still im gonna buy the original version, but heck this is great to have.
B000092Q4U|5.0|I remember taking a chance on lamb of God, and bought this album in a record store, I was instantly hooked, this is good listening till this day its in my playlist, brutal but with good rhythm,excellent guitar work, killer drumming,crazy lyrics, i recently saw them here in Germany at the Rock im Park, they were outstanding live,buy this album,even used, just buy it, my personal favorite but check out their other albums. <br />               -peace, marcus.
B00005JMFQ|4.0|What's most enjoyable about Love Actually, besides the terrific scoring (inventive use of pop songs to bridge from one story to the next) is the inspired casting.  Along with wonderful comic bits from Bill Nighy and the actor playing Colin (those two alone were worth the price of admission), several gifted actors do themselves proud. Case in point: Sarah, hopelessly in love with a co-worker and emotionally strangled by caring for her brain-damaged brother, could have been a bathetic mess in the hands of anyone less talented than Laura Linney.  I was also impressed with Alan Rickman and Emma Thompson, totally believable as a married-with-children couple who deal with each other comfortably on an everyday basis, but who are thrown for an emotional loop over an office romance.  And Colin Firth (okay, I do have a teeny crush on this guy and am not totally reliable as a critic!) is the only actor I know who could convincingly sell the writer-loves-housemaid story.   <br /> <br />What's less satisfying is the director's overreliance on his stock-in-trade story resolutions.  Curtis always has to include a mad dash for the airport to get two characters together -- in this movie, there are TWO mad dashes -- and Prince Charming must always rescue Cinderella from a drab life with a dramatic flourish (in this case, two Princes, Colin Firth and Hugh Grant).  Curtis uses his gimmicks with charm and skill, but they still feel gimmicky and one longs for more surprises.   <br /> <br />Two other minor carps: (1) I am willing to suspend disbelief long enough to pretend that an 11 year old boy can learn to play the drums expertly in two weeks, but I refuse to accept that on the very night of the big show,  he's still in his room learning the basics.  (2) If Hugh Grant is cast as a P.M. in his late 40's or early 50's, for heaven's sake put a little gray at his temples or something.  Grant looks 25 here, negating the intended older man/younger woman aspect of his relationship with Natalie and rendering Emma Thompson's greeting of her \\"big brother\\" late in the movie a little silly. <br /> <br />One final comment, not on the movie itself but about some of the reactions to it:  I'm bemused by the postings that claim  Curtis' casual use of interracial couplings represents some sort of P.C. gone amok. This demonstrates a complete ignorance of the British sensibility on race.  Class differences are everything in British culture, NOT the black-white divide as is the case in America.  <br /> <br />Those who see a \\"left-wing agenda\\" in a totally unpolitical movie like Love Actually could vastly benefit from learning something of other cultures and mores, as well as checking their own biases in the mirror.
B00008NG5V|3.0|I purchased this CD because 'Brushfire Fairytales' was such an amazing album that I couldn't pass on the follow-up.  What I got was the same Jack Johnson as the previous album - no surprises, new techniques, nothing to really set it apart from his first release.  What I got from listening to it just once through was \\"wow, this sounds...just like the first album.\\"  Not to say that this is a negative thing;  but for the casual Jack Johnson fan, just one CD is probably enough, and I'd say 'Brushfire Fairytales' would be the better choice.   <br /> <br />'On and On' is the perfect CD to take on a weekend drive, to the beach, or just to listen to when feeling mellow, or aching to capture a carefree time in life.
B0006L16N8|5.0|It's the only music my iPod has played since Tuesday when it came out.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I purchased this CD and listened to it for hours on end - and by the next day, I realized that I had still not heard the album in its entirety!  The music is so enchanting that I keep replaying certain tracks over and over - and every time I do, I feel as if a part of me is melting away.   <br /> <br />Musically, the album is on par with Coldplay's second album, 'A Cold Rush of Blood to the Head';  they are indeed perfectionists when it comes to writing seamlessly beautiful melodies.  Lyrically, however, 'x&y' arguably surpasses Coldplay's sophomore release.  Personally, the songs seem more introspective.  A hauntingly honest look at life, it touches upon feelings such as love, fear, and self-doubt.  Certain songs (i.e. 'Fix You', 'What If') express hopelessness yet are uplifting all in one.   <br /> <br />A must have in anybody's Coldplay collection.
B00006L83N|5.0|This album is by far, hands down, the best pro-metal album ever to be released, and i could say that listening to just the title track, this album features one of the best vocalists, Russel Allen, and of coarse, my hero, on guitar, Michael Romeo.  <br />I feel that if you like face melting metal this album delivers and is definetly a must buy weather your a fan of John Williams, or Slayer. and now the tracks, 1. Inferno (unleash the fire) - This song is a burner and very very fast, the vocals growl and this is definetly a pace setting riff for the whole album. 2. Wicked - This is definetly the heaviest song on the record. Starts out with a ballsy riff and very haunting keyboard lines, definetly a favorite. 3. Incantations of the Apprentice - This is definetly a vocal based song and oh man, is there vocals. Russel's voice in this one could tear down a brick wall and the guitar lines are genius, also, Jason Rullo's drums are insane on this track. 4. The Accolade II - This one starts out with very beutiful piano and violin melodies and is a very very well composed song, by far one of the best compositions on the album. 5. King of terrors - This one is Destruction. the song has a very hounting sound and very heavy guitars. 6. The Turning - one word, Insane. This song is very very fast and is very \\"shred\\". I play guitar and this is definetly one of the coolest riffs anywhere. 7. Awakenings - This song is one of the most moving and romantic (not a metal word haha) songs on the album. There is a big Vocal/Piano melodies and is very brilliant, but then Romeo kicks it up and throws very very fast and cool riffs in. Laso Michael Pinnela's Keyboard riffs are beyond amazing. 8. The Oddysey - imply put, THE GREATEST SONG EVER. 24 minuetes of genuis and the best compositions ever, Mozart and Bach would be proud. Everything about this song is great. They could have just put this song on the album and it would be a hit, definetly worth buying for just this song. 9. Masquarade '98 -this is a remake of the original from the first Symphony X record, and in this version the guitars are kicked through the roof. GREAT ALBUM GET IT NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B00007E8V4|5.0|This oddly-packaged gem is often ignored by the media. (How many articles about the band's new release \\"Mesmerize\\" treat it as the band's \\"third album\\"?)  But whether it is a hodge-podge collection of unreleased stuff, or simply outtakes from the Toxicity sessions, this album stands up as a cohesive work, and arguably a more solid piece of work than Toxicity.<br /><br />Kicking off with \\"Chick'n Stu,\\" a great scathing indictment of consumer culture, S.O.A.D. rage in top form, with a handful of slower songs tossed into the mix.  \\"Nu-Guns\\" features a very interesting solo by Daron on what sounds like some Eastern string instrument, \\"Ego-Brain\\" might be the prettiest song this band has come up with yet, and \\"Bubbles\\" is ... one of MANY strong tracks - this whole abum flows well from start to end.<br /><br />Overall, Steal This Album is not as good as the debut, but it's still a damn good bunch of songs from one of the few interesting hard rock/metal bands out there.
B0000CDLA7|2.0|Not much to say- this album is just full of forgetable songs, It plays the least of all my DT albums- Its just kinda sad. Buy the new one 1st- its way better. Maybe start with Scenes from a Memory.......uuuugggghhhh I dont even want to look at this album again- I cant go 1 star- because I like DT. ITS 2 stars for DT- not comapred with all other records
B0006L16N8|2.0|The major dissapointment for me are the flaccid lyrics which drift over each song like alagae on a pond. And this is the overall trouble with the album - there's nothing profoundly bold or strong. There's little that really kicks ass, and therefore I find that their success is somewhat confusing. <br /> <br />This is frustrating as I'm a real coldplay fan, and maybe the songs are better suited for intimate performances as the band have so often done throughout the trial and evolution of the songs. But they just don't transfer well and drown themselves into a decaying bed of mediocracy. <br /> <br />'Speed Of Sound' is a rehash of 'Clocks' with a bit of tinkering around. 'Fix U''s melody fades fast into musical abyss. Nothing much grabs my attention and makes my love of the band feel unjustified. With the also dissapointing 'Don't Believe The Truth', it seems the musical muscles of today's bands are being built by powdered mixes of harmonies and lyrics which have a 'just add water' feel to them, rather than a real muscular musicality built on graft, passion and love for their art. <br /> <br />Where is our new favourite band!? <br /> <br />
B0009A1AS2|2.0|Well, there is not much more to say- yes, Pick up Symphony X- they canb do a real epic- Octavarium DOES only have about 7 minutes of real music- WOW- what a great review!! I'd give it about 2 1/2 stars- to 3 stars- but for the dissapointment (esp songs 1 and 2) it gets 2 stars. Oct is not an EPIC song, nor will it ever be.
B0006L16N8|5.0|the album is top-notch, just as parachutes and a rush of blood, its one of those pop-in-the-CD player-don't need to push skip CD's.  Coldplay definitely has a style all their own.  Some criticize that X&Y is just like A Rush of Blood, well, maybe it is, but isn't that what makes them great and stand out among others?  I just like to sit back and listen to the harmonic sounds of Coldplay. <br /> <br />Coldplay music, is the type of music you can always listen to, no matter the mood.  Coldplay always hits the spot(emotionally); they seem to have a song for every emotion.   <br />Some of my favorite are Green Eyes on Parachutes, and Don't Panic on Parachutes.  While studying abroad in NZ, I was with a group of students on a tour bus, Don't Panic came on the radio.  We were all sitting around each other discussing the beautiful scenry in NZ, when the song came on.  We all stopped, listened to the song and ended up singing along.  Ever since then, Don't Panic has been our group travel theme song, but we often refer to the song as Beautiful World and not Don't Panic.  I haven't listened to X&Y enough yet to pick out that perfect favorite, but I feel it coming on any day. <br /> <br />X&Y carries on the top-notch tradition of Coldplay success and I think it will be a big hit this summer.
B00097DX3U|4.0|I recently bought the new Audioslave album (ok I bought it the day it came out) \\"Out of Exile.\\" I have to say it totally blows away their debut album. Now, it's nowhere near as good as Soundgarden was, but what can be? As with most of Chris Cornell's later projects it seems heavily lyric and vocal oriented, but this album really showcases Tom Morello's ability not only to make insane noises and guitar tones but well structured flat out rock solo's. This album feels a lot less like a raw jam session and a lot more well written and thought-out. Cornell's lyrics seem to be deeper, although it seems he never acheives the kind of dark beauty that was so apparent in Soundgarden's lyrics\music. I'd also like to see him play more guitar. Anyway, it's a damn fine album and it COMPLETELY blew away my expectations.<br /><br />Essentially all of the songs on here stand out. The single \\"Be Yourself\\" is a good song, but definately not the best. The opening track \\"Your Time has Come\\" serves as a heavy intro to the album (much like \\"Cochise\\" on the first album). The title track \\"Out of Exile\\" stands out as an anthem in its own right. Some songs seem reminiscient of previous efforts by Chris. \\"Drown me Slowly\\" seems as though it could belong on Soundgarden's Superunknown, \\"Man or Animal\\" feels like it could be a track from Down on the Upside, while the rest of the songs could be compared to Temple of the Dog (I'm sure artists cringe when their work is compared to other things they've done, but hey, everyone has a style).<br /><br />I'd highly reccomend picking this up today.

B0009A1AS2|1.0|I feel I deserve my $11.88 back.  The soundtrack to a toilet flushing (actually, that would sound better.)  Maybe their next release.      I think a little more downtime should be spent before the next release.  Major disappointment, guys.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Dream Theater has been one of my favorite bands and I too have been following them since IAW(Images and Words). This album is different than ToT in that it's not as heavy. The last album reviews, people complained that they were too heavy and others loved the heaviness. Dream Theater is and has always been a little experimental so you don't like every album all the time, but there's usually enough to make everyone happy. This one so far reminds me of FII a little bit. It's almost like the Label asked them for something more commercial again. This is also very Jordan Rudess-centric Album. You can really hear a lot of piano and synth parts in this.  <br /> <br />Also, if you happen to like Dream Theater or at least the more melodic progressive side of Dream Theater, you might listen to Shadow Gallery who also have a new album 'Room V', a concept album. Just a little plug for another Great band.

B0009A40ES|4.0|Mary Harron's American Psycho (based on the infamous Bret Easton Ellis novel) is really quite a brilliant movie. I recall seeing it five years ago when it first came out, but never really appreciated it much until I saw it again recently. I remember liking it when I first saw it, but found it rather disturbing. Watching it again, I realized what a brilliant comedy it actually is. It's not a thriller at all, it's completely a dark comedy. A very dark comedy. It brilliantly satirizes the \\"yuppie\\" lifestyle by portraying young businessmen as hollow, soulless robots whose only concerns are: A) having an expensive apartment, B) Having a nice, stylish business card and C) Getting reservations to the nicest, most expensive restaurants in town. Director Harron portrays these people almost as inhuman, and in the case of Patrick Bateman (Christian Bale), unfeeling and homicidal. Christian Bale gives an amazing performance as Bateman the yuppie psycho. Bale alone makes the film worth watching. His character is cold, arrogant and able to murder an innocent person without batting an eyelash. There's a very memorable scene where Bateman slaughters a coworker with an axe while discussing the music of Huey Lewis and the News. Christian Bale is always believable as the meticulous, obsessive psycho.    I feel that as a whole, American Psycho doesn't completely work. Towards the end, it feels a little bit aloof and ends rather abruptly. There's really not much of a conventional story, so that detracts from it a little bit. However, the movie is so well directed and acted and so on-target with its satire, that I can easily overlook its flaws. Don't watch it expecting a horror movie or a suspense thriller. Many people are bound to misunderstand it, but American Psycho is really an intelligent, razor-sharp dark comedy. If you like dark humor and hate shallow, materialistic people then by all means check out American Psycho immediately.
B0002NRRAG|2.0|Her cover of Leonard Cohen's \\"Dance Me To The End Of Love\\" rivals the original.  But the rest of the album is pretty bland.  She has a very good voice that's almost just like Billie Holliday but not quite.  Her backing band is very good but just not good enough.  Although many people hate her, Norah Jones had found her own voice and that's why her first album was so great.  Madeleine Peyroux has yet to find her own voice, both literally and figuratively speaking.  If she does, she'll become a much more accomplished artist.  But until then, save yourself the money and just download the Cohen cover.
6305971099|4.0|This is an interesting sequel that follows number 4. Michael Myers is being shown from Halloween 4 being shot by numerous rounds of bullets and finally ends up floating in the river. He is pretty injured up from the wounds but is still alive. He manages to get out of the river and then collapses and an old man helps him recover even though Michael is unconcious.<br /><br />Halloween 5  does not have the dark, scary, foggy atmosphere that Halloween 4 had although there are a few moments. Danielle Harris reprises her role again as Jamie Lloyd.  Jamie is now in  special childrens hospital and cant talk but develops telepathy with her uncle Michael Myers and knows where he will strike and kill his next victim. She tries to do everything to stop him but she cant talk. You see this poor girl seeing these things and go into seizure like states desperately trying to say the words as to where he is to save the lives of her step sister and a friend.<br /><br />Donald Pleasance is back and is probably the only person along with Danielle Harris to make the movie good. Pleasance and Harris acting is very well done. The other acting is rather poor especially the teenagers. Like usual Michael is killing anyone in his  path to get to his neice Jamie. It would have been better if the story line was changed instead of the usual,  killing anyone who gets in his way scenario.  There are some entertaining moments where Jamie tries to talk to Michael so Michael can actually see her as a human being as opposed to seeing her as something else. There is an interesting scene where a  man in black boots  gets off a bus  and his hands have a mysterious symbol on them the same as Michael Myers does. Does this symbol tell us who Michael Myers really is? This man plays an important role towards the end. Dr. Loomis forces Jamie to be in Michaels old house near the end so they catch him. At the end Michael who is in jail and his neice is outside in a police car hears an explosion and investigates it. Michale is gone and it leaves you with questions as to who is the man in black that \\"freed\\" Michael.  Halloween 5 is probably more gorier than number 4 and  the body count is higher. I would recommend it to Halloween fans like me. It's not that scary though, maybe 1 scene at the most. This scene involving a Halloween party where a 2 teens go up to a old barn to have se* and Jamies friend is left alone after the party ends and has to deal with Michael on her own pretty creepy.  I would give it a B for an overall good effort.ates it. Michale is gone and it leaves you with questions as to who is the man in black that \\"freed\\" Michael.

B000003CMB|5.0|I have many regrets in my life. At the top of this rather long list, along with never stepping foot on another planet, is missing the Allman Brothers' Fillmore East concert in 1971. Why, you ask? Buy this landmark recording and you will understand.    The Allman Bros, in the days of Duane Allman (who, in my opinion, is probably the best slide guitarist to ever pick up a bottleneck) were the best live band, and this recording illustrates this fact beautifully. Through the seven recordings pieced together here, the band keeps you on the edge of your seat, and sometimes knocks you off.     THe whole band starts out white-hot with a scathing rendition of \\"Statesboro Blues.\\" Dickey Betts is a little stiff on the first couple tunes, but he soon is pushed to the title of blues master by Duane. Then comes a reworking of Elmore James' \\"Done Somebody Wrong,\\" Which is probably my least favorite on the album, but nevertheless, a great song. The band cruises through five more, some reaching marathon lengths, like \\"Whipping Post,\\" which is worth every second.    The true highlight of the album, though, is the brilliant cover of T-Bone Walker's \\"Stormy Monday.\\" The musicianship is superb,and Gregg's vocals (and organ, I might add) are top-notch. The amazingly terrific solos are played atop one of the best-sounding rhythm sections in the biz, which is the recipe for blues perfection.     As far as the improvisation goes, Allman and Betts are on the same level as the best of the best. In fact I think it may be truthful to say that they are the best. Allman's slide is like quicksilver rolling over his strings, and through every song e doesn't repeat a lick. He has become my idol, and I have tried in vain to become the replacement Duane Allman since I first heard this album. The crowd eggs him on maniacally, and he is quick to hush and satisfy them with his relaxed and thoughtful way of playing, sometimes (like at the 11-minute mark of \\"In memory of Elizabeth Reed, and throughout mostof \\"Whipping Post\\") working the band into a frenzy. Barry Oakley matches him and Dickey perfectly, while Butch Trucks and triple-J belt out tight thunder.     Everything on the album is blues and rock perfection, with incredibly quick responses from the rhythm section. I dream of traveling back in time and seeing that legendary concert, but since I know that is impossible, I settle for this recording, which is as close as it gets to taking you to the making of the greatest live album of all time.
B0009AM5JA|3.0|The album gets off to a roaring start.  Square One is an amazing song.  Hey, great bands can't be near perfect all the time the way A rush of Blood to the head was.  U2 didn't achive the same greatness of Actung Baby or the Joshua tree with Atomic Bomb.  Give Coldplay credit for NOT trying to remake Blood to the head.  It's hard to deny the 80's influence on this album- and it will no doubt be huge.  The songwriting is a bit weak this time around- but overall a pretty solid record.
0446310786|5.0|The thing that you carry with yourself in the book is the innocense with which the entire story is narrated. Scout Finch, a eight year old girl narrates her experience of joy, sadness, grudges, racism and above all courage. Atticus Finch, her father and a lawyer is up trying to save a black man from being wrongly accused of rape of a white woman.  <br /> <br />As the events happen, one feels the ugly side of human beings. The narration from the eyes of a child adds to the questions that are being silently asked in the book. There were lots of plots in the book, being Jill Harris, scout's friend, Boo Radly and the child's obession to drag Boo out of his house.  <br /> <br />The interaction of Jem, scouts brother and scout herself deserves a lot of credit for the overall outcome of the book. This is one book nobody should miss. If you haven't read it, you has certainly missed something.
B00008S2VG|5.0|I can say to all of you right now that I am not just another diehard Madonna fan who automatically loves every album she puts out simply because of the name behind it.  American Life is the first Madonna album I ever heard, and it is what inspired me to look into her more and buy her other albums.  I feel like this album crashed and burned mostly because of the fact that she chose to release the song where she raps as her first single.  Yes, rap artists tend to be black, male, and Ebonics-ridden.  Yes, rap music tends to be about \\"street\\" themes.  That doesn't mean that a white girl who actually SOUNDS white when she raps and raps about something other than being \\"gangsta\\" or having sex is a bad rapper.  If anything, Madonna does what Lauryn Hill and The Fugees did:  shows listeners that rapping began with people seeing how many bars they could rhyme together to a beat.  \\"Bling-bling\\" and \\"hoes\\" and all that came later when rappers found out that they could use those topics to sell albums. <br /> <br />Now that I'm done ranting, onto the album's analysis.  I feel that this album is very musically well-crafted (which is to be expected from Madonna, it seems).  The lyrics are more simple than what we grew accustomed to with her previous two albums, but I don't think this is because she has suddenly lost her songwriting ability.  Clearly, Madonna is a very intelligent woman, and she could have chosen more elaborate words if she wanted to.  However, I think she felt that the messages on this album needed to be driven home hard, and the best way to deliver an important message is short and to the point.  She didn't want any unnecessary decoration in her lyrics, choosing, instead, to make them more colloquial.  This album beautifully represents an intelligent, artistic, brave woman at her most recent and mature point of her recording career.  I hope that the reviews and sales of this album don't prevent her from making more because we cannot afford to lose any more true artists when pop culture is in the state it's in today.
B0001LJC2K|4.0|Well I have bought only 3 singles (online) because I wasn't sure the rest of the album would live up to those. But in any case, Stockholm Syndrome is the one that hypnotizes me the most. I'm not a huge RadioHead fan, not that I don't like them a lot, but I've heard only a few of their songs so I can't say I know them. From the few songs I know, those guys don't sound the same, but again, haven't listened to either band enough to be a good judge. What I DO know is that I can hear Queen a lot.  <br />When I listen to a band, I don't go by whether the sound is original, I don't care if they did copy other bands. What I care about is whether the particular songs do it for me. I listen to a very wide range of music (classical, alternative rock, heavy metal, world music -- not too fond of hip hop, definitely not into Rap or Country) and for every genre I'm just looking for this: a tune that resonates with something, a tune that is going to make me spend a good 3+ minutes. To me music can be purely entertainment, or it could be a mystical experience. Whatever you get out of something, as long as it moves you. So yes, I like Hysteria, Time is running out, Stockholm syndrome. I don't care if they talk to me about the end of days or about butterflies, about a cat crossing the road or about critical social issues, as long as they do it well. <br />So these guys are not going to be in my all time favorite list (can't expect every band to be Led Zeppelin, AC/DC, Nick Cave, Hsker D, Yngwie Malmsteen, Mike Oldfied or Eric Satie!) but they give me some good time and that's all that really matters.
B0006L16N8|2.0|Coldplay has always been an extremely favorite band of mine.  In my opinion they are eventghe 21st centuries version of the  beatles.  Parachutes was amzing, as was a rush of blood to the head, but there is nothing amazing about X and Y. I see people giving this album five stars and part of me is thinking that they are giving  5 stars because it is coldplay (imagine giving a beatles album less than 5 stars). The point is the music is stale at most times.  There are some good songs, but they all sound the same. The addition of the awful synthesizer is very annoying with that outer space, borderline techo feel. While the album has god songs as said, they are not anywhere near \\"yellow\\" \\"shiver\\" or \\"The scientist\\".  There is no hit songs, only a combination of mediocre and above average. I would definitely recommend their other albums in place of this.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|In the almost forty years since its first release, Bullitt has become an iconic movie of the 60s and for good reason.  Lieutenant Frank Bullitt has been placed in charge of an important witness who will testify against \\"the Organization.\\"  When the witness is brutally murdered, Bullitt must hunt down the killers with his superiors, in the police and politically, breathing down his neck.  As he searches, Bullitt finds more than he bargained for.  While at times the plot can be confusing, it is almost secondary to the movie's impeccable style.  It is simply a cool movie to watch. Plenty of great action/stunts with the famous car chase through the streets of San Francisco and Bullitt's chase through an airport.  With great performances all around, a perfect Lalo Schifrin score, and the famous chase, Bullitt is a must have for movie fans. <br /> <br />  Steve McQueen gives one of his best performances as Lt. Frank Bullitt, the officer placed in charge of keeping a witness alive.  Bullitt is McQueen at his best as the strong, silent cop who will stop at nothing to bring his man in.  Robert Vaughn is perfectly slimey as Walter Chalmers, the politician who needs Bullitt's witness to testify at an upcoming trial.  Jacqueline Bisset gives a great supporting performance as Cathy, Bullitt's girlfriend who begins to wonder if he has become numb to the world around him.  Don Gordon is also very good as Delgetti, Bullitt's partner and loyal sidekick.  The movie also stars Simon Oakland, Robert Duvall, and Norman Fell.  The new 2-disc Special Edition is great for fans of the movie.  Disc One features a cleaned-up looking widescreen presentation of the movie, a commentary track from director Peter Yates, and a theatrical trailer.  Disc Two offers \\"Steve McQueen: The Essence of Cool,\\" a great 90-documentary about McQueen's life, \\"The Cutting Edge: The Magic of Movie Editing,\\" another 90-minute documentary about movie editing, and \\"Bullitt: Steve McQueen's Commitment to Reality,\\" agreat featurette made during the filming of Bullitt.  Overall, a great DVD and must have for McQueen fans.  If you haven't seen this movie, check it out, you won't be disappointed!
B0009A1AS2|4.0|I have been a DT fan since I was in 8th/9th grade in high school. I have seen them 4 times in concert and own all their commercial releases and some bootlegs/imports.   <br /> <br />I believe that Octvarium is a refreshing and easily accessible album.  The variations of styles and recording techniques is great.  The keyboards are very present in all sections.  Petrucci doesn't have any epic solo sections compared to albums, but I don't think he has to anymore...we all know he can play!   <br /> <br />You can see how they allowed influences from other bands into this album.  I listened to the album one time all the way through just trying to match up sections to previous DT songs or to other bands.  Of course the opening track is a continuation of Glass Prison and Dying Soul.  You can hear riffs that sound like LTE or  off of Petruccis solo album.  Octarium (the song) has a whole section that sounds like a new Transatlantic track, another that sounds like Yes/Kansas.  And Never Enough sounds like the british band Muse (amazing band ...check them out).   <br /> <br />Some call this noticable influence a sham, fluff, rip off, and boring...but humans nature is to live based on experiences and things we have been exposed to.  I think this album shows that DT is human  and that they want to make music that makes them happy as well as their fans.
B00004Z400|5.0|This is a classic deftones album. It has all the visceral bite the previous album did, yet it bathes each song on the album  with an abstract melody that up until this point was unheard of from the masters of sonic emotion.<br /><br />Nowhere on the album is this more evident then on the second track digital bath. It has the ability to bring me to tears every time I hear it. It's so beautiful yet raw that it pulls you in two different directions threating to bring you to your knees (In a good way).<br /><br />I love this album and would recommend it to anyone who is sick of the same old schlock and wants something diffrent.
0393312836|5.0|Clockwork Orange is a wonderful original piece. The whole new language or slang that Burgess invents for the book gets some getting used to but once you're a few pages into it you'll get quite used to it.  <br /> <br />The story takes place in England which is not really relvant to the story but that where it take place. The main character, Alex, is a young thug who robs and hurts people for fun with his friends. He messes around with the homeless, beats up other gangmembers, he rapes women and in general causes a lot of havoc.  <br /> <br />One day he gets caught by the police and he kills an old woman in her home (by accident). He hears about a deal where if he lets some doctors perform some new experimental procedure on him they'll release him a lot sooner, so he goes along with it. Here is where the story really begins to unfold. I won't ruin for you so you'll have to read the book. Trust me you'll enjoy it.
B0006L16N8|5.0|The only people giving this album less than 4 stars are competitors from other record labels. They want to convince you that this is a bad album. But it isn't. \\"X&Y\\" is the best CD released in 2005 thus far. It's exceptional. Buy with confidence. Coldplay has truly outdone themselves this time.
B000069AUI|5.0|This album is everything it is hyped up to be and more. Of course \\"Clocks\\" and \\"The Scientist\\" are amazing songs but its not like some albums where the only good songs are the hits. This whole album is great from beginning to end and there are no tracks that you have to skip over. Coldplay has a refreshingly unique, tranquil, melodic sound. This album epitomizes how music ought to be. This is easily one of the best albums to come out in a long time, so if you don't have it go get it. And please vote \\"Yes\\" this review was helpful!
0783225725|4.0|\\"It's what people see inside themselves that makes them afraid\\" intones Jim Duncan (or his living ghost) as he climbs out of the bed of the woman he has just \\"enjoyed\\".  A man of honour who seeks revenge on a whole town who stood by while he was apparently whipped to death by guns hired to kill him because he would not hide the fact the town was mining illegally on government property, Clint Eastwood is brilliant as is the magic photography of Bruce Surtees. All who deserve it get their come-uppance and one of the final images of Clint standing in front of a wall of flame is straight out of the course Old Testament Revenge 101. A minor classic of the genre.
B00005JLR8|4.0|How I would rate this film varied as I watched the film -- sometimes it was a 5 and other times it was so slow I was thinking \\"2.\\"  Overall, I'd give it a four.  It certainly isn't anything like Hollywood turns out, but I really thought it was a bit uneven and slow at parts.  Still, it is well worth the not-so-good parts to watch the brilliant parts.    The story is based on the life of the producer (as you learn from a bonus on the DVD).  He came to America illegally with his wife and two children in the early 80s to become a Broadway actor -- apparently not very successfully in the first year, if one is to judge from this film.  The family in this film takes a terrible apartment in the only place they can find -- a building full of characters, mostly junkies. They seem oblivious to the danger and settle in, in the process making friends with an artist who lives in the building.  The family is grieving the death of a child, and much of the film involves the struggle to come to terms with that loss.  As Sheridan emphasizes, it is the story of a loving family.  That it is.  Like many \\"true stories,\\" it is episodic in plotting, which means that it's a bit like reading someone's diary only this is on film.  The two Irish girls who play the daughters in this family have mesmerizingly sweet faces and manners -- the film is worth seeing for them alone.  They are completely believable and the movie would be nothing without them, although other actors in this film also put in very good performances.

B0002Z0EYK|4.0|Troy is a moving story about the siege on Troy. The symbolism and music greatly propel this film forward. The fight scenes are great but the love connection between Orlando Bloom (Paris) and (Helen) are not shown enough. They look like their whole relationship is just drived on a sexual relationship. The story is good and should be seen but I am not sure it is worth buying.

B0009AM5JA|5.0|Let me start by saying that this album is really, really good.  Yes, you can whine about the fact that some of the songs are &quot;classic&quot; Coldplay - but that's a good thing.  After religiously listening to both their previous albums this one in a lot of ways seems like a continuation...Some whiners might say that they are not experiementing enough but why mess with something that works? And please, lets not compare these guys to Sigour Ros or Radiohead; in terms of their sound Coldplay isn't nor will it ever be in the same league.<br />&quot;Square One&quot; in my opinion is the best song on this album, followed by &quot;Talk&quot; and &quot;White Shadows&quot;.  The current single is really good too. To be honest any one of these songs could become a favourite because they all get better the more you listen to them.  Buy this album, you won't be disappointed!

B0006L16N8|2.0|I loved Coldplay's first two albums, but this disappointing offering shows us what happens when a BIG band wants to be too big for it's boots, but falls short by producing contrived and laboured songs, too pretentious for their own good. <br />The only songs I like are, ofcourse, Speed of sound, which is a poor cousin to Clocks (which is one of the greatest songs EVER, I reckon) and that hidden track which sounds like Coldplay the way it used to sound before it produced X and Y. Simple but unforgettable.

Let's be clear;  U2 is a band that, while not always prefect, and sometime completeley over the top, can safely be recorded in history as thee most influential and defining in post modern rock.  U2 paints with huge strokes and has taken massive risks with their craft -sometimes with great success and sometimes with great embarassment but at all times with great boldness and adventure.  The next band that comes close to carrying this mantle would have to be Radiohead.  Coldplay has a long way to go before they hold a candle to either. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong.  X&Y is a fine record.  In fact it's a perfectly and genetically engineered piece of alternitive rock for the masses.  (Wait, alternitve for the massses?  Isn't that an oxymoron?)  In the end, that's the problem with X&Y;  What it delivers in bic-lighting and arm swaying ballads -it lacks in edge, adventure and sound defining color that they scratched at with \\"A Rush of Blood...\\"  Yes, to have all three in one album is a tall order.   But isn't that the least we could expect from a band publicly claiming aspirations to be the next U2?
B000065U1N|5.0|This was an underrated war epic masterpiese and the most brilliant work of ridley scott. I think no one could watch it till the end and does not get surprized! and if anyone doesn't like to have this movie for his or her own, it just for it's gore scenes that some people could not tolorate! <br />anyway, if you've decided to buy it for your own,, I suggest you not to buy this release cause it has rather no special features. there is another 3 disc edition of this movie. i strongly recommand that release instead of this one and if you buy if for any additional price, you'll not regret it!
0553573403|5.0|A Game of Thrones is touted as one of the best 'Fantasy' novels ever.  It is truly a great piece of work, but on the Fantasy genre spectrum, it is on the far left.  There are some mention of dragons, magic, and other mythical things, but they are not at the center of the story.  Don't let that scare you hard-core fantasy fans away; this book is of very high quality.<br /><br />I would highly recommend this novel to all, even non sci-fi and fantasy readers.  The plot, if stripped of it's medieval context, could be re-written to fit any day and age.  The character development, action scenes, climactic moments, witty and intelligent dialog, broad scope, and intertwined sub-plots are some of the best I've read in any genre.  If you happen to like kings, knights, princesses, dragons, medieval warefare, and the like, you will love this book all the more.<br /><br />This book is the first book of a (so far) 4 novel saga.  From other reviews it sounds as though the sequels are as good, if not better, than the first.  I just started the second book and I have to agree so far!  Looking forward to following this saga.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Well, dispite what everyone is saying, I thought this was a really good album. Yes, the vocals were a big change, but I actually enjoy it more because screaming at the time just shows that you have no vocal talent (don't get me wrong, there are exceptions) but i like versitilly in the vocals. Screaming/singing combo vocalists are really good. Anyway, back to the CD. At the risk of being bashed, I actually thought this album is better than Waking the Fallen. I think everyone musically stepped it up several notches and solos in almost every song is refreshing. One of the drawbacks with Waking the Fallen was the lack of solos in LONG SONGS. To me, it just makes the songs drag. But with City of Evil, that is gone. I was very impressed with the musical aspect of the record, as you can tell. The songwriting, I will adimit, is not as good as Waking the Fallen, but writer's block happens to everyone. I also think that the Western music in Sidewinder and the Orchestral parts in The Wicked End were very interesting and put a cool twist to the songs. So to sum things up, I'm glad that Avengie moved to a major label without changing their sound in a bad way, and i do think that this can compare to Waking the Fallen, if not surpass it.  <br />   Another thing i want to point out is why some people are calling these guys not \\"Metal Enough\\" and they recomend stuff like The Red Chord instead. Well, yea, Avenged Sevenfold isn't that kind of metal so of course it isn't going to sound like it.Why would you come on here and bash them for not sounding metal enough when you already knew their style of music in the first place? It's stupidity at it's finest. It makes me want to bash AC/DC for not sounding \\"Metalcore\\" enough.
B0000844IT|5.0|Oh man, is this ever classic. My favorite of Raimi's Evil Dead Trilogy and Bruce Campbell's (a DEITY among men) finest performance (Bubba Ho-Tep not withstanding).<br /><br />It's got time travel, undead armies, knights, Ash, the Necronomicon, cheesy gore, evil mini-clones, stop-motion slapstick, Ash, and shotguns and chainsaws. Yessss. High camp done oh so RIGHT.<br /><br />Not to mention one-liners pouring out of every orifice. \\"Gimme some sugar baby.\\" \\"Good, bad... I'm the one with the gun.\\" \\"This is my boomstick...\\" etc. etc. etc.<br /><br />Own this film or you pose.<br /><br />Oh, and the Director's Cut: It's interesting, but ultimately inferior, with a lame alternate ending, wack pacing, and some of the best lines omitted (!). Stick with the theatrical version.

B00004BZ16|3.0|Sandinista! certainly won't go down as the best Clash record. Taking the sprawling muse of the classic London Calling and going even further with it, this triple-LP (whoa!) has no direction or cohesion whatsoever. Rock, reggae, dub, hip-hop (!), gospel (!!), ska, funk, jazz, waltz, dub, and even a children's ditty can be found here and more. \\"Artistic vision\\" or not, this is an album badly in need of an editor. Perhaps they took the \\"The only band that matters\\" line a little too close to heart.<br /><br />But before you bash this album as an unforgivable disaster on the part of Strummer & Co., listen to it. There's definitely solid material on here, albeit only enough for one 35-40 min. LP and not three. At its best, the music is no less effective than the best parts of London Calling. The Magnificent Seven is a great opener and demonstrates the band's fascination with the emerging hip-hop culture. Somebody Got Murdered, Charlie Don't Surf (classic), The Call Up, Something About England, Washington Bullets (the album's title track and one of the band's best reggae tracks), Lightning Strikes (Not Once But Twice), Up In Heaven (Not Only Here), and Police On My Back (the closest thing to a standard Clash punk tune) all rule. Strummer and Jones' vocals are still in fine form, and the politically charged lyrics have some bite (albeit a bit more rambling than on previous efforts).<br /><br />However, the rest of the album is often less than B-side level. I mean, come on, a children's choir version of Career Opportunites? Are you serious? The Sound Of Sinners, a hackneyed attempt at gospel is also rubbish. While London Calling offered some solid forays into pop (Spanish Bombs, Train In Vain), most of Sandinista!'s attempts at the style are New Wave-esque, cheesy, and embarrassing. A clear foreshadowing of the direction they'd take on the even worse Combat Rock.<br /><br />My thoughts? The first three Clash albums are indispensible; get 'em first, starting with the Green Album (one of the finest '77 offerings available). Borrow a copy of Sandinista! from a friend or buy it used, then cull the best tracks and burn your own version of Sandinista!. Don't bother with the rest of The Clash discography unless you're a completist.the Green Album (one of the finest '77 offerings available).

0553579908|5.0|I started rereading the series in anticipation of the release of A Feast of Crows, so I've had ample time to take in this wonderful series at a leisurely pace.<br /><br />I decided to read with a more critical eye on this go-round, but quickly found myself immersed in the story once again. Even knowing what was going to happen didn't spare me from hoping that things would turn out the way that I hoped they would. A story this strong is a testament to the skill of the author. Add to this the news that A Feast of Crows will be ready on July 28th, and I'm jumping for joy!
B0006L16N8|5.0|What a return to form for Coldplay. Like they were never away.<br /><br />Lead off single `Speed of light' does just that, racing along at the speed of sound and a bit similar to `Clocks' from `A rush of blood...'. Very catchy, and already a worldwide smash<br /><br />Other standouts include the questioning `What if' (that starts of real gentle and slow, before erupting) and the delightful `Talk' which features a (shock, horror!) sample from `Computer love' by Kraftwerk. `Square one', the sober hymnal `Fix you' (with the touching lyrics -lights will guide you home/and ignite your bones/and I will try to fix you- very apt for the times we live in) and `Twisted logic' are other masterpieces on this outstanding CD.<br /><br />For those expecting something drastically different from their past efforts, you won't find that here. Wait a minute, that is not strictly true, they did sample which is a first, and there are some whiffs of U2 and Radiohead here and there.<br /><br />Simple, catchy songs about life, love and everyday things.<br /><br />Worth the wait!
B00000J7J4|4.0|At first it was weird with all these \\"newer\\" guests helping him out. But I like it. It gave his songs a new flavor.

B000002J1L|5.0|Nursery Cryme(1971) is where Genesis starts getting good. With a line-up of seven great songs and the entry of Phil Collins as drums and Steve Hackett with guitars, this album is where Genesis really gets cooking. The first song, THE MUSICAL BOX, is a hit. It starts out with a 12-string guitar with Peter Gabriel singing softly. Then the song gets loud, sounding a bit like THE KNIFE. Next coming the lovely and short FOR ABSENT FRIENDS, where Phil makes his lead vocal debut. This song is a nice transition between the two big rockers of the album. THE RETURN OF THE GIANT HOGWEED is a typical Genesis rocker, with the funky keyboards and Peter singing oddly. SEVEN STONES is one out of the three mellow transitions, this might be the most soulful and dark song on the album. HAROLD THE BARREL is the most catchy on the album with Peter and Phil singing together on this one. Harlequin is the final transition before the grand finale. Unlike Seven Stones, this song is bright, magical, and beautiful. And my personal favorite, THE FOUNTAIN OF SALMACIS wraps up the album. The song starts out with a dramatic synth and then Peter starts singing. This song gives one the feeling of being in a forest in some kind of Fairy tale. Anyway, this album is a great one to own.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|Que barbaro!!!!!! Cuando algunos fans pensabamos que a este viejo que nunca envejece, le quedaban por ahi 2 o 3 discos buenos para retirarse tranquilamente en su hogar canadiense, y dedicarse a su familia y a una que otra invitacion de giras; nuevamente nos vemos gratamente sorprendidos, por esta genielidad infinita que parece tener esta leyenda de la musica. <br />El disco es realmente una pieza magistral, en todo sentido de la palabra. Solamente en imaginar el concepto inventivo de un tipico pueblo norteamericano, y entre cancion y cancion, entrelazar toda una historia de una familia especifica con los habitantes del lugar, a traves de las vivencias expresadas en canciones cronologicas. <br />Las 3 primeras canciones \\"Falling from above\\", \\"Double E\\" y \\"Devils Sidewalk\\" son descriptivas acerca de la familia Green, que es el eje principal de la historia. El abuelo, los padres, la nieta Sun Green, el primo Jed, y de sus historias en el rancho \\"Double E\\". <br />la trama toma mayor interes a traves de la siguiente cancion (una de las mejores) \\"Leave the driving\\" , en donde la oveja negra que es el primo Jed, es detenido por un policia llamado \\"carmichael\\" por posesion de drogas, y ante su incapaz capacidad de controlar la situacion, termina asesinando al oficial. <br />Precisamente la siguiente cancion \\"carmichael\\" (mi favorita)nos narra un monologo de la viuda recordando al oficial y esposo fallecido. <br />Otra de las buenas piezas \\"Grandpas interview\\", es una excelente critica a la libertad del silencio, expresada por la muerte del abuelo de un infarto al tratar de repeler el ataque de unos periodistas, dispuestos a cualquier cosa para obtener una noticia por el encarcelamiento del primo Jed. <br />La ultimos 2 temas, tambien excelentes, \\"Sun Green\\" y \\"Be the rain\\", se refieren a la lucha ambientalista de la nieta Sun, y la ultima una reflexion a todos para que protejamos las reservas ecologicas de nuestro planeta. <br />Para esta oprtunidad lo acompaan 2 de sus Horsemen, Ralph en la bateria y Billy en el bajo, sumados a la guitarra y organo del maestro.  <br />Un rock folk, como solo los Horsemen lo pueden interpretar, y por si fuera poco el disco viene acompaado por un concierto acustico solista del viejo Neil en Irlanda en mayo del 2003, donde interpreta todos los temas aparte de describirlos. <br />Maestro, si quieres retirarte como los grandes puedes hacerlo, te sobraste, enseale a esos mocosos que insultan la musica, y la destruyen con sus porquerias sonoras. <br />Pero como te conozco, se que nos tendran un par de sorpresitas mas............
B000003CMC|5.0|\\"The Grateful Dead of the South\\", \\"Improv Masters\\", whatever you call them, The Allman Brothers' \\"Eat A Peach\\" is a milestone in rock music. With a song listing that reads like a greatest hits, you can't go wrong. I recently saw The Allman Brothers and Lynyrd Skynyrd in concert in Savannah, and it was awesome. I bought this CD today, and listened to the entire thing. Yes, even Mountain Jam. I love how they combined live footage with studio recordings. The first half deals with Allman Brothers after Duane, and the second half showcases Duane's genius on his last album. So here's the breakdown-  <br /> <br />First, something you should know- <br />This album was dedicated to Duane Allman, who died during this album's creation.  <br /> <br />\\"Ain't Wastin' Time No More\\" is a great song with great piano and guitar. It's one of their pioneers. \\"Les Brers in A Minor\\" is an awesome instrumental that rocks! It sounds as though the band is warming up in the beginning. \\"Melissa\\" is one of my favorite songs by them. A great ballad with the guitar work of Dickey Betts. \\"Mountain Jam\\" is a monster. Clocking in at 33:38, this live instrumental showcases the entire band in some way. GREAT! \\"One Way Out\\" is an Allman Brothers classic. The definitive blues piece. \\"Trouble No More\\" is a nice blues piece with a catchy guitar riff. It's played by them a lot on tour. \\"Stand Back\\" is a great song, though not my favorite. Not necessarily weak, but not the strongest one on the album. \\"Blue Sky\\" showcases two of the greatest guitar solos I've ever heard. Finally, \\"Little Martha is the anthem for Duane. It's an acoustic guitar duet between Duane and Dickey. So good. The entire album is good. If you don't own it, buy it. You won't be sorry. <br /> <br />And every time you eat a peach, eat it for peace- <br />Eat it for Duane.
B00005ASIL|3.0|I bought this CD a while back, and it did get a lot listen from me. I'm not a die-hard fan at all. I just like Jethro Tull. I love \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"Living in the Past\\" and must say there are some good songs for a beginner on here. I borrowed my first Tull Greatest Hits. It was a three CD set of all their awesome hits. I have yet to find that CD set. If this is you first Tull CD, it's not bad- <br /> <br />HOWEVER........ <br /> <br />There are several things wrong with this \\"greatest hits.\\" First off, how can you fit \\"Thick as a Brick\\" into three minutes? Obviously, you can because they did it. Rigorous.... Also they shortened \\"Minstrel\\" and the ENTIRE song is great. The version on here is good, but once you've listened to the real thing, you are spoiled. Also, where is \\"Cross-Eyed Mary,\\" \\"Teacher,\\" \\"To Cry You A Song,\\" \\"Hymn 43,\\" and \\"Nothing is Easy\\"?  If you want Tull's awesomely rock-on style, you gotta' have these songs.  What about \\"Skating Away\\"? If you want their definitive hits, you gotta' have at least a two disc set to fit the entire songs of the long ones and the other great ones. Lastly, who's idea was it to put \\"Steel Monkey\\" and \\"Cheerio\\" on there?   <br /> <br />In all, if you want some cool Tull songs, just the studio albums or a better greatest hits (if you can).

B00082IJ08|5.0|I have been a fan of the Gorillaz since I first heard them. Three years later I still adore their old CD and listen to the entire CD (because I love every single song) as much as I can. Demon Days is a must have because it is true to their art form and style of music, but it has new twists, new sounds, different topics, and a diverse range of songs. There is not one song I don't like and honestly, I can listen to the CD three times in a row! This CD is beyond expectations!

B0009I7NNA|4.0|I am truly sick of reading these close-minded reviewers claiming that this album is horrible because Shadows doesn't scream anymore.  Given, Waking the Fallen is one of my favorite albums due to its sheer balance of aggression, depth, technical skill, emotion, and power.  And Sounding the Seventh Trumpet gave us Warmness on the Soul, which is arguably one of their greatest songs.  People, you have to have an open mind and try to appreciate all kinds of music.  Realize that the band is trying to mature and take the music in a different direction.  After all, they openly worship bands like Iron Maiden, Metallica, and Guns N' Roses.  And this album strongly permeates with all said bands unique styles.  Zacky and Synyster have improved so much and offer us amazing riffs and licks that I can't wait to learn to play.  Their solos flow more now and they give us at least two in each song.  One reviewer had the audacity to say that this is overkill.  Apparently, he does not realize that guitar is an integral aspect of rock music and having two solos in each song is very admirable.  The Rev has stopped his NOFX inspired drumming and is playing more like he should be.  Johnny's bass playing is also vastly improved.  I must admit it is hard to group this CD into a specific genre, but isn't that saying something.  This album seems very progressive to me.  Seize the Day is a power ballad that reminds me of Guns N' Roses' November Rain, which is not too shabby of a song at all.  Bat Country is frenetic and energetic along the lines of Second Heartbeat or older Metallica stuff.  Avenged Sevenfold are the sole reason I decided to pick up playing guitar back in 2002 and I am so glad that I did.  I was a bit skeptical when I heard that Shadows damaged his voice, though I believe that he could still scream if he wanted to.  But the band clearly believes that's not the direction they want to go in.  Not to mention that the vocal lessons seemed to have payed off because Shadows can hit amuch wider range of notes and his voice is brimming with more emotion and meaning than ever before.  The fact that they get along with one another and enjoy playing really shows in their songs.  Don't get me wrong, I love heavy stuff.  I listen to everything from the casual Killswich Engage to the occassional Madball to the from-time-to-time Agnostic Front.  I also enjoy and appreciate all sorts of classic rock and even alernative jazz rock like Uncle Tupelo.  I'm simply saying, if you have an open mind and appreciate rock music, City of Evil will be a pleasant and enjoyable surprise to anyone looking for something with a little more substance as opposed to the trash that's overplayed on the radio today.  So quit bashing this awesome entry into A7X's already excellent repertoire and yes, download some samples and try it out.  If you don't like it then by all means don't support the band, but all true fans of the band will love this album.  As will all music lovers with an open mind.  I can't wait to see these guys at Warped Tour this summer, along with Atreyu and Bleeding Through.  City of Evil is a great album that I would wholly recommend to everyone.
B00005JKCH|5.0|I had seen a bit of the \\"Spider-Man\\" movie a while ago, on this two-disc widescreen edition, and I thought it was awesome. (I thought it was awesome from the TV commercials as well; those ads, as well as a couple of Cingular ads, are on disc one.) Last summer, I rented that exact same version and IT WAS SO INCREDIBLE! <br /> <br />You'll love the picture and sound quality this DVD set offers, as well as the bonus features, two DVDs worth, everything from the TV set (trailers, making-of documentaries, still photos, outtakes, actual Marvel comics, easter eggs, etc.) to your Windows computer (Record Your Own Commentary!, weblinks, and more!). <br /> <br />This is a great movie on a great DVD set for a great deal. If you want to go even bigger, try to find a Superbit version. There are no bonus features on there; however, a better picture and sound quality plus Asian subtitles make up for the lost remnants from the 2-disc set!
0156027321|5.0|Being a librarian I read alot of book but this is honestly the best book for adults(saying an adult book is always an awkward moment, right up there with mentioning the adult video collection, but I am a children's librarian) that I've read in the last 3 years. The beginnings of the book really set the stage as the son of a zookeeper (Pi) living in South Asia is struggling to find truth and wisdom. Pi is religiously eclectic and finds truth in Hinduism, Christianity and Islam-which is all well and good for Pi until the Priest, Imam and teacher find out. As a part of a zoo transfer, Pi is on a boat with many animals including a Tiger, named Richard Parker. Throughout the rest of this book the need for survival and pure animal instincts is quite strong. Yet the strong is so much more than an outdoor-adventure survivalist book. It is a book of personal strength conviction, and as the prologue say, It is a book that will \\"make you believe in God.\\"  <br /> <br />Honestly, this is a book that demands 2 readings. Why, you ask? Your perspective on the whole story will probably be dramatically changed by the ending, much like Walk Two Moons by Sharon Creech. With that new perspective, you'll be dying to re-read it and see how that new perspective (no hints!) informs the rest.  <br /> <br />SPOILER: I'm still not sure what to think about the floating island-that is just one of those weird tangents that works perfectly in the authors mind, but if an editor cut it out, it might be a more tightly-crafted tale. <br />
6300267881|1.0|For years I heard all about this film and how it was so \\"scary & disturbing\\".Not long ago I actually saw it and was so BORED by it I fell asleep and didn't even bother to finish this garbage.   This is perhaps the Most overrated movie of all time, full of cheesy special effects and a typcial hollywood ending. I find NOTHING compelling about the storyline and demonic posession in general. In fact, its one of the most rediculous surviving medieval superstitions that was used to explain mental illness and psychosis.The fact that people were actually scared by it and just go's to show how gullible the masses are.
B0000024R8|5.0|I am one of many who are probably discovering the earliest Bob Dylan due to the publication of his autobiographical Chronicles Vol. I. I first sort of got into Dylan around the Blonde on Blonde album, but being more interested in other musical forms, never became a true fan. Sure, I would hear the older, purely acoustic Dylan as background at older friends' homes mostly, but never really gave it an honest listen.<br /><br />  Well, after reading the Chronicles, I simply had to check out his early oeuvres... and WOW! This album, his first, packs quite a punch! Those familiar with and expecting his trademark reedy, nasal twang will not believe how POWERFULLY this guy once sang and played! See some of the other reviews for details, but all I can say is even if you don't own ANY Dylan, but have read Chronicles and are curious as to how young Bob sounded, BUY THIS ALBUM! (I actually bought it on old-fashioned vinyl...and his other first five albums, as well!). Enjoy!
B00005JMEW|5.0|This is an incredible movie - smart, witty, sexy, sharp, and beautiful all at the same time.  There are some gripes about this story not having a story, which is totally not true.  The plot revolves around The Bride (a superb Uma Thurman), who was shot and left for dead during her wedding.  \\"Kill Bill\\" tracks her revenge on two of the five assassins: Vernita Green (Vivica Fox) and O-Ren Ishii (Lucy Liu, who totally redeems herself for her two mindless \\"Charlie's Angels\\" movies).  This is a pure revenge film, but a wonderful and visually fantastic set-up for Volume 2, which develops the story even more and fleshes out its characters.   <br /> <br />Still, even if Volume 1 just shows Uma Thurman getting her revenge on her assassins, it's a great film.  Quentin Tarantino, a master of technique, uses his knowledge of 1970s Shaw Brothers Hong Kong kung-fu movies to create a beautiful work of art.  It isn't meant to be realistic; it's meant to be extraordinary.  The fight scenes are over-the-top and the fruit-punch blood spurts like geysers but this movie isn't really \\"violent,\\" per say.  It's so unrealistic (in a good way) that it's ironic, satirical, and funny.  Tarantino's style pokes fun at, celebrates, and transcends the kung-fu movies.  His writing is also often quirky, colorful, funny, and sometimes dead serious.  It's a lovely combination.   <br />  <br />If you want more examples of Tarantino's total dedication to his work, look at where he chooses to set his scenes and what kind of music he picks.  Just because the movie is violent doesn't mean that Tarantino doesn't have a sense of beauty.  He knows what he's doing, and one only needs to look at his use of an elegant, quiet, snow-covered garden for O-Ren Ishii and the Bride's final fight.  There is also an incredibly moving and exciting anime sequence in the movie.  Also, the use of the MUSIC is absolutely incredible, and one of my favorite aspects of this movie.  I can't say enough good things about it.  In one scene where O-Ren is being driven to the restaurant, the trumpets in the background music perfectly match the light that passes on O-Ren's face.  Everything is timed so perfectly.  Music is so important to this movie; you'll feel your adrenaline go right up just hearing it.  It's really that good.   <br /> <br />There is great acting in this movie...I can't think of a single character that didn't intrigue me.  To single a few of them out, though: Uma Thurman gives an amazing performance.  I loved how she could alternate from being funny, sexy, serious, charming, and deadly so easily...  She kicks major butt in this movie, but she isn't exactly just a stereotypical, generic, tough action girl.  There's a real brain and a real heart behind her character.  Also, Lucy Liu (O-Ren Ishii) is so good in this movie, I personally think Tarantino should make another movie just about her.  She is a character so rich and so complex, it would be a travesty to just call her only a \\"villain\\" or \\"The Bride's adversary.\\"  And besides, some of the best scenes in \\"Kill Bill\\" featured O-Ren Ishii and her posse.  My personal favorite character in \\"Kill Bill\\" has got to be Gogo Yubari (Chiaki Kuriyama), O-Ren's teenage bodyguard.  Kuriyama plays Gogo with fun menace...I loved the fact that she was young, beautiful, and crazy.  Just watch her in the few scenes she has...she just oozes coolness.  It's that combination of the school-girl outfit, smallish stature, youngish face, long straight black hair, and beautiful deadly eyes that is just awesome.  Suffice to say, I also think Tarantino should make another movie about Gogo, too.  Heck...most of the main characters are so awesome and complex that Tarantino could make another movie out of any of them.  It's a testament to the strength of Tarantino's writing.   <br />  <br />\\"Kill Bill\\" is one entertaining, beautiful, smart, exciting visual bonanza.  Don't pay too much attention to the people who gripe about the lack of story and excessiveviolence.  Whatever it may be, Tarantino has presented pure storytelling at its finest.  10/10
B0007Y08QA|5.0|The Machinist ranks in the top echelon of psychological movies. It's a brilliant character study that examines the effects of sleep depravity, among other things, on the human body and mind.  <br /> <br />Trevor Reznik is a employee at a local machine shop. He hasn't had a night's sleep in over a year. He weighs 121 pounds, and is losing weight by the day. He sees a man who no one else sees, or do they? <br /> <br />Throughout the movie, it is easy to get lost in the mystery. This movie never fails at keeping the audience guessing.  <br /> <br />Most impressive is the emaciated Christian Bale. His commitment to character is one of a kind. It's not hard to get involved with Trevor's story because Bale makes it so believable. It is hard to imagine the amount of weight Bale lost for this role. There are scenes where it feels as if Trevor will waste away to nothing in front of your eyes. \\"If you were any thinner you wouldn't exist.\\" <br /> <br />As the movie enfolds, Trevor's paranoia grows. As his paranoia grows the true mystery of his condition begins to reveal itself. This movie is a great study of the human condition under the worst scenario.  <br /> <br />Five out of five stars.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This album blew me away!! I have both previous albums but I never really liked them. I'm not in to the screamo scene. Heres how it goes down    Beast and the Harlot- Cool intro, beautiful drumming, Even though this is probably the worst song on the album doesn't mean it's not good.    Burn It Down- Great song, I think theyr'e making a video for this its either this or Bat Country, im not sure good transitions, I like how from the beginning its all heavy and then you hear the melodic solos and back to heavy    Blinded in Chains- Begginning sounds a bit like Burn it Down nothing special here    Bat Country- This was the little sample song on the a7x website. Very catchy chorus and i think its becoming a single.    Trashed and Scattered- EXCELLENT INTRO one of my favorites    Seize the Day- Acoustic, calm soft song. very good    Sidewinder- Once Again AMAZING INTRO!!     The Wicked End- cool song, another favorite    Strentgh of the World- either this or the next song is my favorite, western intro,very creative    Betrayed- one of my favorites dedicated to Dimebag Darrel of Pantera!    M.I.A.-another favorite some parts sounds like Maiden's Hallowed Be Thy Name       Favorite Songs- Burn It Down, Bat Country, The Wicked End, Strength of the World, Betrayed, M.I.A.      ATTENTION- Old a7x fans do not get this album there is not one scream at all! anyone new to a7x or who likes stuff like Iron Maiden, Metallica, and Pantera this is pretty good...I CANT STOP LISTNING TO THIS ALBUM
B0002IU988|5.0|First things first- this is NOT a \\"watered down version of creed\\" as someone else reviewed.  This album is more powerful and more define than anything creed has ever done.  Secondly for those who opposed the vibe of creed- this album was entirely written by guitarist Mark Tremonti- it is heavier and does not contain scott stapp- type song writing; the band shows less restraints and more plain powerful rock music. <br />One Day Remains is a powerful hard rock album which fulley shows off the song-writing and guitar playing of Mark Tremonti; it contains numerous guitar solos and great riffs.  It is also one of the most complete albums i have heard in recent memory- every song is distinguishable and solid.  In my opinion it blows away creed in which each of their 3 albums contained numerous gaps. <br />-I saw creed live on the weathered tour and alter bridge live on their last tour w/ silvertide and submersed.  While the creed show was amazing- the alter bridge show blew it away and ranks 2nd in the best live performances i have ever seen behind metallica @ giants stadium 2003 summer sanitarium.  Even better live than on the album.   <br />Stronly encourage you to buy this album and check out Silvertides Show and Tell. <br />One Day Remains is right up there with Megadeth's The System has Failed and Avenged Sevenfold's City of Evil for the 3 best albums of 2004/2005
0316172324|1.0|I was enjoying the interesting concept of this book until, in the last half, Gladwell's agenda came out with clear force. I was set-up. Use real world cases and all sides of the case until you want to push the agenda and then tell only one side, and what only one side should have done to avoid snap judgements. It's incredibly irresponsible to have left out what was left out of the last half of this book. <br /> <br />If there's 100 points of data that tell the whole story of \\"blink\\", Gladwell hand-picks the 20 that fit his desire to demonize police while laying no responsibility on individuals who act as criminals and completely disregards crime-to-race proportions. You must suspend reality to believe Gladwell's assumption that gun-related crime is totally unrelated to race in bad neighborhoods. Because clearly no one should assume based on real numbers and shady behavior in an out of the ordinary situation that anything out of the ordinary is occuring. Gladwell would have us assume, and control our reaction in a life or death situation in the \\"blink of an eye\\", that dangerously acting individuals in incredibly dangerous places and situations should be treated as if they were 80-year-old grandmothers in broad daylight.  <br /> <br />No mention is made of what the criminals could have done to avoid the confrontation. Perhaps he left it out since my 8 year-old nephew could spell it out. If police yell \\"POLICE! DON'T MOVE!\\" then you might want to stop moving. If you continue to move and dig in your pockets you are not only asking to be shot, you should be shot. Gladwell's one-sided agenda is sickening in this particular part of the book. <br /> <br />It's a clearly picked-evidence piece that takes a conveniently limited, one-sided cross-section of the research to slide it's agenda onto the bestseller list under assumed pretenses. If you appreciate personal accountability, total fairness on all sides of a situation, and true responsibility, don't bother buying/reading this biased disappointing opinion.
B00007M5CO|1.0|I bought this CD because of the good reviews it had received on this site and in hope that it would be similar to Gotan Project's Revancha del Tango. Surprisingly enough, I find this album to be very different from Gotan. And not for the better. <br /> <br />I am no expert neither on tango nor on alternative electronic music. But I must say that it sounds to me like Gotan uses electronic sampling to enhance the tango, while Bajofondo uses tango to bring out the best in electronic sampling! There is not a single track on Bajofondo without a modern drum beat! Which I feel have no place in tango. It takes all the feeling out of it as far as I'm concerned and makes it too much like every other kind of music that floats around in clubs. Gotan hardly ever use a drumset - the rhythm in their music is supported by the more traditional instruments as well as by the sampling, which is exactly what makes their music stand out from the crowd. <br /> <br />Luckily, taste is a strictly subjective thing, and it seems that most other people are happy with this. But I decided to post my view on Bajofondo just in case there were others like me out there. To me, tango is a diamond in the rough and not meant to be something that fits the regular mould every time. This time, a regular drum beat is the mould being forced upon the tango, which is a great shame as some of the tracks could have been interesting without the infernal drums...
0684800713|4.0|The Sun Also Rises was my first introduction to a Hemingway masterpiece and it has certainly changed my perceptions on \\"writing\\" and \\"literary style\\". At first, I wondered why he was going on and on about aimless lives, and by the end of the bullfight it was so clear that Hemingway was a literary genius. Word became character and character evolved into word. His narrative absolutely captured the lives of the lost generation after the war, and that is his genius. His ability to transcend the explanatory. Althought written almost 80 years ago, I felt transported to that time when life seemed aimless and yet profoundly full of optimism and hope.
B00001OH7V|5.0|When I bought \\"Heroes\\" I was twenty years old and in the middle of an emotional breakdown.  I didn't know it at the time.  In this period I became obsessed with David Bowie, I also bought Station to Station, which is probably my favorite of his.  I was falling into mania, unaware I had bipolar disorder.  l pulled away from my friends and stayed at home, listening to this album.  I couldn't sleep, I was tense and nervous, and songs like \\"Blackout\\" seemed written for me: \\"Get me to the doctor, get me on my feet, give me some protection.\\"  The production seemed beautifully hopeless, and Bowie's famous vocals on the title track illustrate his own anguish.  I developed a fantasy that Bowie and I were going through the same pain.  To me this album is cold and compelling.  I will always think back to that time when I first heard it.  The Berlin Trilogy is one of the most fascinating series in music history.  I'm sure this record was colored by the harsh Communist atmosphere that permeated Bowie's studio near the West German border.  If you're expecting something like \\"Let's Dance\\", look elsewhere.  \\"Heroes\\" is a statement and a challenge, well worth undertaking.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|I'm still surprised how much I enjoyed Collateral.  Generally I'm not a Tom Cruise fan, and my previous Jamie Foxx film experience was only Booty Call(I've since seen Ray).  The only reason I watched this movie was that Michael Mann directed it.<br /><br />I'll have to admit that the premise was intriguing to say the least, but ultimately the back and forth banter between Cruise & Fox is what elevated this film into a nerve wracking, white knuckle suspense ride; halfway through you're not sure if you're strapped in properly, but you don't care, because what's going down on screen is so damn cool.  I actually found myself wishing I'd seen this in theaters.  Nevertheless, I thoroughly enjoyed the viewing experience.<br /><br />The level of cruelty and violence Cruise's assassin displays was altogether unexpected.  It's absurd and flinch worthy, almost cartoony at times, but it always is presented with flair and style.  In fact the whole movie comes off as something you might see in a graphic novel.  Pretty cool stuff to see get Hollywood backing.<br /><br />Also, as a very nice added bonus feature you get the incredibly beautiful Jada Pinkett Smith (that Fresh Prince is one heckuva lucky guy) as the damsel in distress.<br /><br />When all is said and done what you get is a witty action/drama that never seems to let up.  I imagine any taxi driver after seeing this film became very wary of picking up white haired Caucasians.  That alone is hilarious enough to make me recommend this movie.
B0002DB50E|4.0|Turn off your hearts and disengage your humanity curious cinephiles!  If ever there was a movie that deserved to be called a cult classic, Videodrome is it.  Although the plot doesn't make much sense (especially the last half hour) you can't take your eyes away from the screen.  I can't tell you what the hell was going on but I enjoyed watching it nonetheless.  It's even got a memorable catchphrase: \\"Long live the new flesh!\\"  Cronenberg is a director unlike any other.  This movie is ice-cold and fascinating.  At first it seems like a brilliant comment on the desensitizing nature of television, then it embarks into a nightmarish world replete with repulsive special effects by legendary Rick Baker.  The word \\"Videodrome\\" is also spoken about 95 times by various characters.  The plot is basically David Cronenberg exploring his presumably dominant dark side vis a vis a satire of cable TV.  Like I said before, the third act takes you down a bizarre path, but hey, if you weren't up for it, you wouldn't be watchin' it!  If you're a fan of Clockwork Orange, you might dig this intellectualization of cruelty.  It's a trip.  You gotta wonder if Cronenberg is as f*cked up as his movies.  Not recommended to the casual viewer.
B000000OTU|1.0|This disaster epitomizes all that is wrong with corporate sellout rock music.  Aerosmith is responsible for some of the greatest rock of the 70s, but here they hired some professional writers and set a torch to their storied legacy.  Crazy, Amazing, Crying, Blind Man - each is rewrite of the other and they all belong on a Cher album.  Seriously.  They have nothing to do with rock n roll.  Aerosmith had a FEW decent tracks from this time period (FINE, Young Lust, The Other Side, geez I'll even say that What It Takes was ok for a ballad), but the rest of this album is pure schmaltzy vegas pablum.  Man, even the cover looks like it was whipped together in 3 minutes.  And come on - how stupid is the title?  \\"Big Ones, get it?  Har har har\\".  Hey, if you know these songs and you love 'em, then more power to you and have fun with this album.  Anyone else who wants to expereince the real Aerosmith should start with Rocks.  Aerosmith: No shame.

B0002EXH54|1.0|Peace Sells is one of my favorite metal albums ever, and in 1986 it rarely left my tapedeck.  I would welcome a remastering, BUT, note that the album is remastered AND remixed!  Why??!!  Contrary to what you might have read, this album was not re-recorded, but it was remixed, which means the entire sound of the album is different.  I'm not complaining because it sounds \\"cleaner\\" (why can't Metallica remaster their 80s albums?), it's actually an entire new sound.  For example, the Reign In Blood remaster was fantastic - it beefed everything up louder and crisper.  But on this remixed version of Peace Sells, the vocals are overbearing, the drums sound hollow, and Dave Mustaine, who really is one the most interesting guys in metal history, can't keep his A-type personality in check and engages in revisionist history to the detriment of Megadeth's fans.  Buy the original and keep it on CD as it's only a matter of time before it goes out of print.  In short, it's fine to remaster, but Dave, leave the remixes to Puff Daddy.  This album is a travesty.

0205313426|5.0|This is a great reference for anyone who communicates in English.<br /><br />This small book takes a subject that is generally dry and makes the most of it.  Reading a volume on the rules of usage and principles of composition is normally rather tedious.  In this compact guide, the authors educate readers in a rather painless way.<br /><br />Most people would benefit from an occasional refresher in this area.  Even many professional writers would do much better if they absorbed some of the principles here.  There are some rules that seem pretty rigid.  Some of the rules don't seem very applicable any more due to evolution in the language.<br /><br />Nevertheless, this is a valuable guide that will benefit anyone who reads it.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|I love Dream Theater. Now that I have said that what happened to the guitars? I was very excited about this album comming out but now that I have it I'm very dissapointed. It is way too soft to be a Dream Theater disc. Trust me you are better off picking up James Labrie's latest solo disc. At least it rocks hard.
B0006L16N8|4.0|This is a review for the record \\"X&Y\\" by Coldplay.  This is not a review dealing with Gwyneth Paltrow, Apple, U2 comparison, Paparazzi, or any other rubbish.  I have listened to this record many times, unlike many other reviewers, and will be reviewing the songs and nothing else.   <br /> <br />X1. Square One- Eerie keyboard intro....very Pink Floyd-ish.  Then out of no where comes a sci-fi techno beat and an intense guitar/bass line.  This is a great way to start off a record.  It reminds me of \\"Politik\\" from AROBTTH rather than \\"Don't Panic.\\"  I like the ending when the song is left with just an acoustic guitar and Chris singing.  The first and only time he says Square One is at the very end....I love it.  Starts the record off in outer space.  (9/10) <br />X2. What If- I tend to get bored with the verse.  It's obviously a ballad, which doesn't bother me.  I do like the chorus when the guitar and Chris's vocals are soaring.  The ending is most pleasant as well.  It tends to get old but is an okay track.  (5.5/10) <br />X3. White Shadows- I was excited by the title.  I was hoping for a darker tune like \\"Spies\\" or \\"GPASUYF\\", but oh well.  I really like the chorus.  The lyrics are a little weak.  The guitar playing in this song reminds me of the Edge.  A lot more keyboards....(7/10) <br />X4. Fix You- This is probably the best song on the record.  I'm sure it will become a classic.  The lyrics are touching, finally, the church organ is genius, great symbol work, the guitar solo is heart pounding, this song is just great.  At about 2:33 the song just races, if you are driving it will make you want to speed.  I've had this tune stuck in my head for days.  I'd say if \\"Speed of Sound\\" is to \\"Clocks\\", this is to \\"The Scientist.\\"  I really liked the four part harmony to end the song, just fantastic. (10/10) <br />X5. Talk- I really like the call/response relationship with the guitar and vocals.  I think it is very fitting.  This reminds me about wanting to get to know someone and doing something as simple as talking.  I started to notice Will's emphasis on the symbols rather than the drums, it almost got too 80's for me, but the song is too good to ruin it.  I really like the lyrics to this one.  Another one that will get stuck in your head.  (8/10) <br />X6. X&Y- Very mellow and psychedelic.  This reminds me of The Beatles best era.  I think this might be the most complete song on the record.  Jonny's guitar is so eerie and so crazy.  \\"You and me are floating on a tidal wave, you and me are drifting into outer space\\" is just amazing.  Chris really goes to town on this one. I really get lost in this song.  I kind of get a Pink Floyd feeling again.  Quite rare to hear that style used in this day in age. The ending reminds me of \\"I am the walrus\\" for some reason.  Great sound, very atmospheric.  (10/10) <br />Y7. Speed Of Sound- Everyone knows this one.  I like the message behind it.  To me it's all about noticing the simple things like birds or trees and realizing how evil buildings and technology is.  I really like the bass line in this song and that chorus....(7.5/10) <br />Y8. A Message- This sounds very fitting to the Parachutes era.  This song saves the record from being to over the top.  It's nice to hear an acoustic/down to earth tune.  I think the keyboards are distracting and wish they could have left them out. I love the lyrics though.  This is in my top 5 for sure. (9.5/10) <br />Y9. Low- R.E.M. would have been proud.  I like this.  Reminds me \\"The One I love\\" from the live disk.  Good bass line from Guy once again.  This does have 80's written all over it though.  I was scared at first, but then it became fun.  It is somewhat dark and I like that as well.  (7/10) <br />Y10. The Hardest Part- This is a fairly upbeat tune.  I enjoy the piano.  I'd also say this is a good sing along song, I was waiting for one!  (8/10) <br />Y11. Swallowed In The Sea- This song is annoying.  The whole rhyming bit gets unnerving after awhile.I like the way Chris sings but the lyrics are pathetic.  You don't always have to rhyme!!!   The music is good, but the vocals don't deliver.  Maybe after a few more listens I'll like it, but not yet.(4/10) <br />Y12. Twisted Logic- Great way to bounce back from the last song.  I was getting nervous that they couldn't pull through but they did for sure.  I love the way the vocals are sung.  The arpeggios are pretty dark too.  The title alone is pretty darn good.  The end jam is so heavy, maybe Coldplay's hardest song?  Great way to finish it off.  This goes hand in hand with the first song.  (10/10) <br />(Hidden Track) <br />13.  Till Kingdom Come- It's good to hear the acoustic sound.  I am glad they didn't completely abandon their original sound.  I know they wanted to do a big record, but sometimes simplicity can be just as heavy.  Pleasant lyrics and good folk guitar makes for a fun bonus tune. (9/10) <br /> <br />I think I like the X portion of the record the best.  Top 5 tunes are \\"A Message\\", \\"Talk\\", \\"X&Y\\", \\"Fix You\\", and a tie between\\"Square One/Twisted Logic\\".  This is really a good record.  Yes the sound is different from the last two records, but so what?  You can go back to those any time you want.  I think this is more of a record than a bunch of stand out songs, cause there aren't many.  This is meant to listen all the way through and it truly a master piece from one of the only good new bands around.  Enjoy.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I am a huge Coldplay fan, I have all of their albums and always await new material from the band.  This album is just as good if not better than previous albums by Coldplay, but has some of the same qualities.  It seems that the band likes to stick to one sound for each album and stick with, by this I mean that the songs sound similar, but are still distinguishable in their own amazing way.  You will get a good idea of what a lot of the album sounds like from the first track.  I put the cd in right after I bought it and got goosebumps while listening to it.  I think that this was a combination of the uptempo beat used by the band and anticipation of hearing the rest of the cd.  All in all, I totally recommend \\"X and Y\\", it will not disapoint.
B00025ETIW|1.0|first of all i would like 2 say this is the worst disgrace 2 rock ever, this band is going 2 b responsible for rocks death rock is very quickly falling 2 \\"emo\\" which is awful. and this band is one of the key problems. no musical talent no talent at all this is the worst guitar playing i have heard in my life my little cousin could do this. the whole band is just flat out awful what ever happened 2 distorted guitar and wah wah effects?!?!?if u even remotly play ne instrament do not listen to this brain wash it is terrible. please check out these REAL bands. Nirvana,mudhoney,screaming trees,black flag,minor threat,jimi hendrix,black sabbath,blue cheer,melvins,soundgarden,alice in chains, alice cooper, dinosaur jr, sonic youth, the stooges, mc5, and much more like this please steer clear of this mcr musical damage
B0006L16N8|5.0|Magnificent piece of work! Every song strikes me. Coldplay music requires attentiveness and full-song listens...you can't sample this type of music and walk away with its full meaning and depth. \\"Speed of Sound\\" is a great lead single and \\"Fix You\\" could be an even bigger hit. \\"What If\\" would sound good on the radio too! But this album is a get-in-the-car and go cruising with this sound blaring for about an hour. Love the sound of their music! The album for summer of 2005.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|I really agree with the review below- YES, the Lyrcis. Almost comical- PERT sure knew how to write lyrics- PETRUCCI? Sick to the Guitar buddy- Yeah- I pretty much think they are all out of ideas. They are Getting OUR $$$$$$$$$, thats for sure.
B000002H70|5.0|This cd is wonderful. Disintegration itself stands as one of my favorite songs ever, along with Lovesong and Last Dance. With Lullaby, it could stand as a dance song. Fascination Street is unbelievably catchy yet dark at the same time.  <br />If you're like me and you go around reading reviews to see if you would really enjoy a cd, i assure you that you will not regret getting it. All the songs are plain brilliant and it is a must-have for those into great lyrics & melodies.
B0009I7NNA|2.0|If you buy this CD, buy it for the excellent dual guitar parts(at least on the 1st half of the album).  Synyster Gates has some pretty fast fingers, and the dual guitar gives the CD a kind-of old school metal sound.  However, as many people have said, the whiny, nasally vocals realy hurt this album.  Actually during most of the verses M. Shadows vocals are at a low enough register that they sound o.k., but when he tries to hit notes that are a little bit higher...yikes!  Also, after song 6 or 7 the style changes from fast-paced rock to ... well, I'm not sure what to call it, but it spoils the last half of the album.      So overall, this album could have been really good, but it isn't.  BUT, all of that being said, the first couple of songs are really pretty good.  \\"Burn It Down\\" almost makes this worth the price alone.
B000002JEV|5.0|this cd makes me feel like I am sitting in some small nightclub in Europe in 1969 with a few friends watching these 4 legends play a few songs,these recordings are phenomenal,it's like listening to these songs for the first time again,Plant's voice is totally raw and live. <br /> <br />Stairway to heaven is a little overplayed on most FM stations,but this version makes it seem like a new song,and the 18+ min version of Dazed and Confused,well,that speaks for itself. <br /> <br />I could'nt be happier with the purchase.
0345423496|2.0|This book could have been good. The story is reasonably interesting and the idea that Frank Poole might be woken up from his deep freeze offers some interesting plot possibilities.<br /><br />However, I have some major problems with this book.<br /><br />Firstly, the technology of the world of 3001 is too conservative. Unless the world slips back into a new Dark Ages from several hundred years (George W. Bush and American Christian Fundamentalists are trying hard!), the technology in 3001 will probably be with us a lot sooner - maybe in a couple of centuries (or decades? ;-))<br /><br />Secondly, I cannot imagine that \\"human\\" society will be even remotely comprehensible to a 20th century human being by 3001. A social/technological/biological \\"singularity\\" may well have taken place.<br /><br />My third problem is that the monolith hasn't done anything to Hal or Bowman other than store them as AI programs. The mystery and magic of the transformation/transmogrification of Bowman into a \\"post-human\\" being is blown away in this book. We are presented with a very prosaic picture of Bowman and Hal being stored in a Von Neumann computer. Bowman never travelled to the heart of the galaxy and never came back as a godlike being.<br /><br />It appears that the monolith in this book cannot communicate faster than the speed of light, either!<br /><br />The references to the collapse of religion in this book didn't bother me at all. Unless you are a Christian fundamentalist, an ordained priest or an American, you will be untroubled by the references to religion in this book.
B0002OERI0|5.0|I was never never a big Green Day fan....that all changed the day i found this CD and popped it into the player. Every track is filled with moving and uplifting beats, while the lyrics are truthfull and very pointed...but not so uplifting. But that is life! I highly recomend this CD. I am now officially a hard core fan!! Green Day Rocks
B0000C9ZLD|5.0|Did The Strokes really write an amazing sophomore album? Granted, the second release is not quite as good as its predecessor, but it's pretty damn close. \\"Reptilia\\" is probably their best-known and well-written track. Maybe the best song they've ever released. The sophomore album does show a bigger sense of maturity, but some people gave it crap because it sounded too much like The Strokes on Is This It. I must disagree. \\"Automatic Stop\\" sounds like nothing I've ever heard of, the first Reggae/Rock song I've known about. This CD is definitely one of my favorites and it changed the way I see \\"garage\\" rock forever. Definitely two thumbs up for me.
B00005JNNZ|5.0|I saw this opening night in the theaters and loved it. I think that Samuel Jackson and \\"Coach Carter\\" did good for basketball as Denzel Washington and \\"Remember the Titans\\" did for football. Personally I don't like basketball but I love true stories such as these. If you want to watch another great true basketball movie see \\"Pistol Pete\\" which is about Pete Maravich, a legend in basketball.  <br />  Anyways, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys sports.
0151008787|5.0|This book is intelligent, witty, heartfelt, appealing, and troubling.  The author touches on many simple things of everyday life that make his life story unique and have affected his writing.  With his superb prose, he puts readers in his own situation thereby giving a sense of what it must have felt like to live the life of Amos Oz.  There are precious reminiscences, my favorite being his parents and himself on the one phone line from Jerusalem to Tel Aviv simply giving a weekly hello to relatives.  He relates his deep shame at having inadvertently harmed a young Arab boy, what it was like to celebrate the night of Israel's Independence, his experience of being ushered out of an auditorium after laughing at Menachem Begin's use of the word \\"to arm\\", how in awe he felt in the presence of David Ben Gurion, how he became aware of his own political leanings, and the difficulty of carving out his own place in kibbutz life. He also opened his soul in revealing the anguish of his mother's illness and the pain of her death.      I love Oz's writing.  It's very passionate, but often in an understated way.  This is a truly special book.  Enjoy it.
B0000584V3|1.0|Heh, this Opeth band calls itself Death metal, will you guys don't know what real death metal is.<br /><br />For true death metal from Scandanavia check out: Unearth, Atreyu, Bleeding Through, and Avenged Sevenfold.

B00080ZG10|5.0|THIS MOVIE BORROWS MUCH FROM CITIZEN KANE. <br />GREAT EXTRAS. <br /> <br />The movie itself rates 4 to 4-1/2 stars. The extras push it over 5 stars.  It has some of the best extras of any DVD I have seen. <br /> <br />This is a very good biography.  It takes Howard Hughes from 1933 (when he was making his first movie) to 1947 (when he became a billionaire aviation tycoon). <br /> <br />The movie is called the \\"The Aviator\\" and it focuses on Hughes growth in the aviation industry.  Besides his obsessive compulsive disorder, most other incidences in his life are dealt with in a superficial manner. <br /> <br />It is a shame that that the movie doesn't explore other aspects on Hughes's very rich life.  But then, the movie would have been 8 hours, instead of 3.  But, I still would have liked to have seen more on Hughes's Hollywood side.   <br /> <br />The style of the movie is very much like Citizen Kane (voted the best movie of all time).  Both handle the life of a troubled, but brilliant billioniare.  Just like Citizen Kane, the Aviator shows incidences in childhood that shaped the adult.  I think that some of the scenes in this movie look like they were copied right out of Citizen Kane. <br /> <br />This movie is historically inaccurate, and the timelines are off.  In some incidences, the timelines are off by decades.  The events were moved around for dramatic effect.   <br /> <br />It is interesting that the bonus features in this DVD set highlight the historic inaccuracies of the movie.  There are very good extras.  There is are two biographies, a \\"making of\\" feature, and discusssions on Hughes's obsessive compulsion disorder.  They are all great. <br /> <br />I rarely give 5 stars, but this is one CD set that deserves it.  I usually own rent DVD's but I wouldn't want to see them more than once.  This is one that is worth owning.
159413023X|4.0|I read this book for my book club who was split, half liking it, half not, but I liked it a lot.  The writer gave a different view of the world, seeing the lives of the family left behind after a terrible tragedy took their daughter, the narrator, from this life to the next.  Interesting views on heaven, the after life and the continuing life and grief of surviving family after tragedy.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|This is a near perfect album in my opinion. The first ten songs are absolute masterpieces, especially Chapter Four and Remenissions (I basically had to change my underwear after hearing Reminissions; it's a PERFECT song - soooooooooo good). There are some seriously talented musicians and song writers in this band. I've never really owned a CD where I thought every song was flawless. I didn't think this way after the first listen - it took more to realize how great it is.    Note: Although there are many heavy parts and screaming, this isn't completely metal all the way through. There are soft/clean parts and lots of melody.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I've read a good number of the reviews and I've been listening to the album for nearly a week now and here is my take. I don't like to make comparisons to other albums in the first few days because I feel that is not fair to the record. You need to listen to it when you are happy, sad, with friends, alone, in hte car, home with headphones, drunk, sober or whatever. Just give it some time to soak in, then make your comparisons. I liked Parachutes, and loved Rush of Blood, so it will be interesting to see where this one lands. <br />   As far as the songs... yes, Speed of Sound does have a Clocks kind of feel. Yes, there are some samples of Kraftwerk and a few other bands, but those are an homage, people. I really do enjoy the ballads What if and Fix you. The songs I can't seem to get out of my head though are Talk and White Shadows. The hidden track is great, I'd love to hear more like it. I also enjoy S of S, Low, A Message, and Square One, and I do agree with alot of reviewers who think Hardest Part is the weakest. It is. Its the only one I am skipping past now. However, as far as the whole CD, if you a Coldplay fan, you'll love it. If not, give it a try. <br />   Now, about some of the other reviews. First, the guy who told each member of the band what they are doing right and wrong. Do you really think they give a rat's ass if you think the guitarist is weak? This is a CD review, not a bandmate review. If you like the band and the CD, great, if you don't, go form your own band or listen to something else.  <br />  Next, the guy who said this is emotionless is clueless. That's way off base. Everyone has been through splintered relationships, broken marraiges and lost loves. Some of these songs sing out what those emotions feel like, and many of us turn to music like this to help soothe the pain. This album definitely delivers in that category. If you can't feel it, you are emotionally devoid. <br />   Finally, for the hypocrits who say they love Coldplay, then complain when there isn't some overwhelming change from album to album. If ain't broke, why Fix it? If the sound is going to change, it will be gradual. Since alot of people like the U2 comparisons, lets go wtih that. U2 didn't reinvent themselves on every album. They had changes from one to the next, but you could always tell it was them. So what changes are you looking for? If Rush was great in most everyone's minds, then why would they even want to deviate? I personally think they are great. They've done some different things on this album, I don't feel it's a retread, and I look forward to the next in 3 years while I continue to cycle through the first three.
B00004XOWM|1.0|PPL THINK THEIR SO COOL JUST CUZ THEY LISTEN TO MUSIC WITH A BUNCH OF CUSS WORDS!!! I CAN STAND CUSS WORDS, I DONT REALLY CARE! BUT SOME PPL OVERDO IT!!!

PLAGUERISM (however u spell it) IS WRONG, AND TOO MANY DO IT! SO IF UR GONNA GET A CD GET ANY EXCEPT THIS ONE!!! or any of their others
B0007Y08PQ|3.0|I've been a Trek fan for many years and I'm still not sure why many Star Trek fans responded poorly to this film at the box office compared to First Contact. It has a decent story, character interaction and some fun action, without becoming a mindless \\"blast-a-thon\\" like so many other SF or sci-fi pictures. There is less action than in First Contact, but there's still sufficient action to liven it up. The acting and direction are decent and the movie runs like a pretty good episode of Star Trek:TNG which is when these movies are at their best. F. Murray Abraham is suitably villainous while the TNG crew members are suitably heroic. The supporting guest stars like Anthony Zerbe were very good. There is a second DVD in the set with enough extra features to satisfy hardcore fans. Enjoy!
B0006IUDXA|4.0|* The video and audio quality is not stunning, but there are no glaring problems.  Very watchable. <br /> <br />* No bonus features...disappointing <br /> <br />* Even though I was expecting it to some degree, the show is more cheesy, kid-oriented and far-fetched that I anticipated.  I don't mean the swiss army knife and duct tape inventions; those are still great fun to watch.  I am referring to the plot lines...at least those in this first season.
B0007M22TI|3.0|The DVD has beautiful visuals and the voices are great.  However, there is so much distortion in the audio that it's quite distracting and detracts from the overall experience.  I'd recommend the DVD, but wish they would put better quality control into creating it.
B0006L16N8|2.0|Coldplay was once the most promising pop/rock band in a very long time.  But the group seems to be degenerating into a \\"Fat Elvis\\" phase -- using excess to compensate for what is no longer there -- evocative, mesmerizing melodies created with spare, but ear-tugging instrumentation.    Before you buy X&Y, put on the first album again and take a good listen.  You won't hear songs like Shiver and High Speed on this new release.  With the exception of one track on X&Y, you'll find your ears assaulted by \\"cinematic\\" extravagance.  Which many listeners will obviously love ... but it's a far cry from what Coldplay originally had to offer.    Yes, Parachutes is a masterpiece.  Coldplay deserves all the success in the world for that one CD.  But they do deserve all the subsequenct critical derision for the music that's come since.    It's quite amazing to go back and listen to Parachutes again ... with only the two exceptions of Everything's Not Lost and Trouble, all the tracks are led and developed by guitar.  And what guitar it is as well.  Wonderfully structured riffs and chords that allow for quiet moments ... that allow for the listener to hear the music.    It seems as if all the trouble with Coldplay started with ... \\"Trouble.\\"  That piano intro later morphed into the Widescreen spectacle of the loud, cascading arpeggios of \\"Clocks\\" which then were retooled for a safe first single on X&Y ... \\"Speed of Sound.\\"  And with these hard-to-resist piano chords and argeggios (Hey, I liked Clocks too when it came out) come Chris Martin's more insipid and purile lyrics -- \\"caught in a spider web -- I'm cold -- I'm alone -- I'm lost\\" as so on and so forth.    Unfortunately, what was an okay, but sappy and melodramatic track on a brilliant album, has now turned into the band's signature sound.  And while it's clearly netted the band a massive audience -- it also seems to signal the band's decision to do whatever it takes to follow up on success.    Coldplay started out with a wonderful musicality on Parachutes.  The melodies were involved, well-crafted and compelling.  With just one album under their belt, they couldn't be cited for repetitive lyrics.    Then \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" came out and there was a significant attempt to build a \\"wall of sound\\" that overwhelmed the listener -- supposedly for an emotional effect, but what really felt like a need to overcompensate for the general lack of interesting melodies and an overabundance of hokey lyrics.    X&Y now brings the band close to the line of self-parody.  The overarching violin swells, the incessant piano arpeggios, the breaking falsetto of Chris Martin ... are all starting to sound tired and redundant.    An obvious indicator or things gone stale and empty is the first single, \\"Speed of Sound\\" which is a transparent redux of \\"Clocks.\\"  Same piano chords in a slightly different progression and practically the same exact melody, now with lengthier and more bombastic bridges.    Most of the other tracks use a sort of pop Wagnerian hysteria that's supposed to translate into a sort of grandeur, but generally sounds like a smoke screen of harmonies to camoflage the fact that there's rarely a decent melody to be found underneath all the over-production.    While the lyrics in \\"Parachutes\\" were often surprising and evocative, the lyrics on X&Y are too often dull and obtuse.     If you're a diehard Coldplay fan, I'm sure you'll love X&Y.  But if you got into Coldpaly because of Parachutes, then tolerated Rush of Blood for the few decent tracks amid the clutter ... you're likely to let down even more by this newest release.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Holy awesome! When I heard Coldplay spent 18 months on this new album I knew it'd be good but I didn't know it would knock my socks off. I don't even feel like listening to anything else but this CD right now because it has gotten so under my skin. Every once in a while one of the songs will pop in my head and I'll be happier because I remember the song. A general overview of the songs though:<br /><br />Square One 10/10 - PERFECT song to start out the album with! It continually builds up momentum and you can just really feel the song it's so powerful. This is the Coldplay we all know and love!<br /><br />What If 10/10 - One of the best on the album byfar. It makes you think about life and I'm just stunned at how well the music set up is for the lyrics. It stays at this constant pace that keeps you going and makes you want to hold up a lighter in the comfort of your home! =P<br /><br />White Shadows 8/10 - Not a bad song by any means, but one of the inferior one on the albums. I love the chorus and it's definitely a fun song to hear.<br /><br />Fix You 10/10 - Hands down my favorite on the album. The band even admits it to be the lynchpin song much like \\"Yellow\\" was for Parachutes. It's just really emotional and I can tell that this song must've taken a lot of effort because everything comes together in this cascade of beautiful notes and words and totally envelopes you.<br /><br />Talk 8/10 - I probably like this one about as much as White Shadows. It's a beautiful song though it's one of the lesser ones. For some reason it feels like a song to play while in a car. *shrugs*<br /><br />X & Y 10/10 - This song reflects one of the themes of the album of the good and bad in a relationship and in life and stuff. The lyrics are just nice to sing to and the music almost paints a picture for you.<br /><br />Speed of Sound 9/10 - I understand why they released this song first, and I like it a lot. My favorite part of this one is the chorus because it's the glue that holds the rest of the song together. Of course it does sound a little like Clocks, but it's different enough that I wouldn't confuse the two.<br /><br />A Message 9/10 - Now here's a song that brings back the acoustic side of the band I've grown fond of. This is just a really pretty song and is almost the perfect track to serenade your girlfriend with.<br /><br />Low 10/10 - You may hear this, and then say \\"It's just meh\\", but then you'll listen to it a few more times and it'll be all over you. It's definitely a departure from their normal style but I like that they're going for some unique stuff.<br /><br />The Hardest Part 9/10 - I can't put my finger on what this reminds me of, but something good regardless. This is another song on the album that almost seems to paint a scene that you can get lost in so I love it for that.<br /><br />Swallowed in the Sea 10/10 - I don't know if I can explain my passion for this song. Maybe it's the way he sings the word. Or maybe it's the calmness with which it starts. Either way, it's a winner.<br /><br />Twisted Logic 10/10 - My biggest like for this song is the way the guitars mingle so well with each other and the drums just cowtow to them. It's just really cool and there's this whole other level to the song with the lyrics.<br /><br />Til Kingdom Come 10/10 - This was a song meant for Johnny Cash and you can tell because of the whole style of the guitar and the lyrics and even his voice. This may be my second favorite song on the album for all those reasons. It makes me wanna grab my guitar and try playing it for myself!<br /><br />I know the number of 10s makes me sound like I'm too lenient, but I couldn't listen to them and give them 9s or 8s or something. And no song on this album was below an 8 regardless. Bottom line: if you liked the previous two, GET THIS NOW! If you're interested in Coldplay, I don't think you'll be disappointed either. This is most definitely their most mature work and it shows that they enjoyed making it.e that holds the rest of the song together. Of course it does sound a little like Clocks, but it's different enough that I wouldn't confuse the two. <br /> <br />A Message 9/10 - Now here's a song that brings back the acoustic side of the band I've grown fond of.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is the series that made me stop watching television programming. When Firefly debuted, I watched it with interest, then amusement, then revelation, then awe. This is what t.v could be. This is respect for the audience that could be prevalent in the genre. As everyone is aware, however, what we (the American Public) actually receive over the airwaves is trivial pap, trite and predictable garbage. <br />Firefly was different. Breathtaking, whimsical, honest and raw, it offered itself up as entertainment without apologies for its excellence. <br />When it was cancelled, I refused to be gulled by the networks again. I refused to form an attachment for a t.v. product only to have it snatched away because the chewing-gum-popping, vapid, American Idol-and-Survivor-adoring lunks (that apparently comprise the Neilsen audience) don't understand that there is no sound in a vacuum. That don't understand what it means to have a show about PEOPLE and not whoosh-and-bang special effects. <br />I'm done. Buy this DVD. It is the best of its kind.
0553802534|5.0|This is her best book since the perfect husband.(which is her very best) I loved this book. Keept me busy reading during the week-end when i should have been cleaning the house:)  <br />For those of you reviewers who didnt like the fact that the sniper shot a man in the head lets not forget this is FICTION!! <br />If you like a good murder mystery this book is for you.
B00005JKG7|5.0|For all you can say about John Carpenter films, and there is much to be said admittedly, one factor which seems to be overlooked time and again is John's personal soundtrack (in coordination with Alan Howarth on some films) he creates out of synthesizer keyboard for (practically) every film he's ever created. <br /> <br />The best example is \\"Halloween.\\"  Without John's soundtrack, this film never would have become the classic it did.  The music made the visuals.  A synergy was created between sight and sound, and sound trumped sight wherever necessary, and complemented it at the appropriate frisson moments. <br /> <br />Owning John Carpenter soundtracks is like owning a Halloween Bonanza.  John's simple, straightforward approach to the keyboard, with punctuated motifs and repetition of terribly haunting riffs, is akin to the way Stanley Kubrick uses sound, sparingly but overpoweringly.  Whereas Kubrick relied on the genius of Carlos, John Carpenter's journeyman's handicraft with the synth is MORE THAN SUFFICIENT to drive every film he's ever crafted, from \\"Halloween,\\" to \\"The Fog,\\" \\"Escape from New York,\\" \\"The Thing\\" to \\"Prince of Darkness.\\" <br /> <br />There's something organic and alive in John's music, and whatever it is living within it, \\"benign\\" is not the adjective I would use to describe the inhabitant. <br /> <br />Take in Carpenter movies for the soundtracks alone.  And then let the music move you, to a place sepulchral, shocking, and deathly terrifying.  \\"The Fog\\" is a prime, perfect example of \\"the sounds ghosts make.\\"  Listen to this movie, and allow \\"all that we see or seem, to [echo] a dream within a dream.\\"  Or in this case, a lingering nightmare.  Listen.
B00008ADPF|5.0|To start off with, I also agree that the track Flat On The Floor has got to be THE best way to kick off a rock album!!  Overall, the sound of this album is much harder than the last.  The songs on Silver Side Up were too much alike.  And I got so sick and tired of hearing How You Remind Me every time I turned on the radio!!  But on The Long Road, I like pretty much every song on here! The only song I'm not too wild about is See You At The Show.  That track almost seems juvenile in a sense. I hear it and I think of the teenage garage band playing by my friend's house after school.
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Yeh Amazon...\\"pop\\", seriously what are you on about? <br />Franz Ferdinand is a slice of Alternate Rock...trust me, Im British...so to anyone reading the \\"official amazon reviews\\" in future....with a \\"Pinch of Salt\\" as they say!!
0671027344|4.0|I found this book to be such an endearing, remarkable version of how emotional, and tough it is to grow up, even little by little.  Charlie's voice is honest and brilliant, his words simple yet profound.<br />I found Charlie likeable, innocent and sweet, not unlike how I felt about the boy in The Curious Incident of the Dog In The Night-Time
B000002KIE|5.0|First thing is first -  I love punk music and to say that the new \\"punk\\" bands (poser bands) are punk is shameful. One thing I see a lot of in these reviews is that greenday isnt punk. I used to love greenday. They started off as punk band - listen to thier very first 2 cds. even the stuff after that has some punk. until American Idiot. Now I can't stand them. Now, to say that there were no good punk bands after the Clash is not fully true. There are still good punk bands, theyre just all underground. One thing people must also understand is this - no. punk is not supposed to take talent. It is a rebellion against complicated songs and overproduction and bands that used huge orchestras. It's point is energy, rebellion, and simplicity. The Sex Pistols are one of the best punk bands ever right next to the Ramones. They're music holds so much anger and is so great. To say they can't play is terrible. Steve Jones is not an idiot - he plays his guitar rather well in some songs - its not just power chords changing temporarily from measure to measure. Sometimes you can even hear him use a scale (which is rare for punk). Paul Cook is a great drummer especailly for punk seeing as the bass drum and snare drum dont just alternate with a hand altenating on the hi-hat. Johnny Rotten (or John Lydon) has one of the coolest voices I've ever heard and is my biggest influence for singing. Sure Sid Vicious can't play bass. I do agree that thats pathetic especially since playing bass in a punk band is not normally very hard at all. He was however capable, he was just two damn drugged to do so. The Sex Pistols were revoloutionary despite what some of you may say- maybe there were other bands that gave more of a revoloution - but its shameful to say that this did not change rock and roll. I have a good amount of knowledge from this. I play the guitar, the bass, drums, I sing, and I write a ton of songs (the latest all influenced by the Sex Pistols). I'm only 14 but my dad was around thenand has taught me a lot about punk. I don't care what you other people say - Never Mind the Bollocks here's the Sex Pistols is one of the greatest albums ever.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|First off i would like to say that I understand why alot of  people do not like this cd. They have done away with the typical screamo/hardcore sound, which is good (although i love that kind of music along with all sorts of other kinds) and when a band that already has an established fan base makes this kind of transition, alot of them aren't going to understand. But they will gain a whole lot of new fans, i guarantee. Anyway, on with the review. What i love most of all on this cd is the way synyster gates and zachy vengance compliment each other. They are amazing musicians who have really stepped in up on the new record. Also the drumming has improved dramatically as well as the bass playing. And listen, Shadows isn't the greatest singer in the world(although he is good)but he doesn't need to be. His vocal style fits the band perfectly. Another great thing to point out on this album is the length of the songs. It's awesome i mean they are epic, but still keep your attention throughout with great tempo changes, very well-written arrangements with orchestra breaks, piano, steel pedal guitar, and a variety of styles of playing that's pleasant to the ear. The solos are great, and well there are alot of them, it was needed for the songs. Anyway, i hope this was helpful, and here are what i feel, are the 3 best songs from City Of Evil. <br /> <br />Track 8- The Wicked End <br />Track 4- Bat Country <br />Track 11- M.I.A. <br /> <br />By the way, visit my band here at [...]
0312323859|5.0|Even though I loved 'Something Borrowed', I really hated Darcy Rhone, and when I found out 'Something Blue' was all about her, I was very skeptical. Much to my surprise though, I LOVED this book. I think I may even like it better than the first one!<br /><br />The book starts out with a couple chapters rehashing the final pages of the first book, when Darcy finds out about Dex and Rachel's affair, and Darcy discovers her own surprise. The following chapters are Darcy being her shallow, manipulative, immature, whiney 'ol self...I still hated her, and thought nothing would change that. But about half-way through the book, when she gets to London friendless, man-less, and at her lowest, she finally starts to grow up and take a mature look at her life and where it's heading.<br /><br />Figuring she needs to end her obsession with Rachel and Dex, find a job, and not be so judgmental based on shallow observations, she sets about trying to right all the wrongs in her life. With the help of her childhood friend Ethan (the one who lives in London) she slowly starts making progress in becoming a better person overall.<br /><br />Bottom line...this was a marvelous read. I loved the ending, and even grew to like Darcy herself. Kudos to Ms. Giffin who has given us two very readable story's that are next to impossible to put down. I will definitely be keeping my eye out for her future novels, she really has a great talent for storytelling.
B000683VI4|4.0|The Notebook is...sappy, unrealistic, romantic and everybody wants to say \\"ugh, it's SO cheesy!\\" but everybody ends up liking it even though it IS very very sappy. It's a guilty pleasure but they make this movie in a way that gets you into it and feeling not so bad about liking it. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are great in this film (Rachel is absolutely gorgeous). They DID win best kiss at the MTV movie awards. Haha. It's a great romantic film to watch with your boyfriend/girlfriend os bunch of girlfriends. Guys will say \\"oh I was dragged to see it with my girlfriend\\" but secretly they will like it (hah). Don't watch it with people who will be like \\"this is SO unrealistic!\\" the entire time. It really ruins it because you KNOW it won't be realistic. It's just the \\"most romantic movie\\" ever!
B0002X314C|5.0|this is a great cd, dont get me wrong. but his live cd at the knitting factory is amazing with beautiful renditions of \\"refuge\\", \\"so high\\", \\"she dont have to know\\", \\"lifted\\", and a version of \\"stay with you\\" that youll find very hard not to listen to all the time. anyways, get lifted is also a definite purchase with the perfect mix of slow and upbeat, with excellent track layout too.  <br /> <br />get this CD!!! <br />
B00005MP58|4.0|Oh how I love this series. The book, on the otherhand, I did not enjoy so much. However, this is a great adaptation and is a lot more exciting. Darcy (Colin Firth) is wonderful of course and so is Elizabeth. The costumes are nice and the acting is great. The DVD doesn't have great features though and it's not very exciting. But, to just own this series on DVD is really nice.
B000929AJQ|2.0|After buying With Teeth, I was very disappointed.  I loved his previous work, because it had a sound to it I could find in no one else's work.  This album however seems more like modern rock than his previous orchestrated discord and melodic synthesized works.  Repeating chords, uninteresting uninspired lyrics, simple drum beats, everything I would expect from a normal rock band, not Reznor.  His songs just had so much more to them, more than this.  It is hard to find a single track on this album that has as much depth as his previous works, its just non existant. <br /> <br />There are only 3 decent songs on this album from my viewpoint, Every Day Is Exactly The Same, Only, and Sunspots.  Which is another disappointment since I am use to listening through each of his CDs without skipping any tracks, but some of them like With Teeth and Getting Smaller are just too painful to listen through.  I got my arms a flip flop flip, give me a break, did Dave Grohl write this song? <br /> <br />If he does produce another album I hope he takes it in an entirely different direction, and looks more towards TDS and TF for inspiration rather than PHM.  For new listeners, they might think differently of this album, but most of the long time listeners know that this was nothing more than something thrown out there under pressure that turned out to be something less than mediocre. <br /> <br />Signed one very disappointed NIN Fan.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Ok. Are my friends and I the only people out there that don't listen to DT for the singing? I've been a fan of the MUSIC of Dream Theatre since the days of Awake and Images and Words because of John, John, and Mike. The two things that have always bugged me are the corny synth sounds they use and the virtuoso singing. Now the synth is totally necessary and LaBrie's voice can be gotten used to but it seems like the albums since Scenes from a Memory have been more and more centered around the vocals. Those albums and this latest one sound to me like James is using the other guys for support until he gets tired and lets them go off on their own tangents. <br />Octavarium isn't the worst from DT but definatly NOT the best. The first two songs are completely boring. I didn't even bother putting them on my Ipod. These Walls begins to pick you up and seems like the album is gonna pick up but then the next track drops you again in the middle of a radio friendly, disappointment of a 7 minute song. Then its up again with Panic Attack and down slightly with Never Enough. At this point you reach some kind of middle ground thats bareable if you don't have anything better to do. The 24 minute title track is a complete snore until about 12 minutes into it when James isn't singing as much. <br />All in all I only gave it a 4 because even when they suck DT is still better than most other bands out there. Truth be told though I'm glad I have Liquid Tension Experiment albums to listen to.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|I'm sorry, but I haven't seen the DVD The Eagles -Farewell 1 Tour- Live From Melbourne, just yet. <br /> <br />However, I am from Melbourne, Australia and I was lucky enough to see The Eagles live in concert in Melbourne last November 17, 2004 - my birthday! <br /> <br />And if the DVD lives up to anything like their live Melbourne concert at the Rod Laver Arena that November night before an absolutely packed house, then it will be nothing short of sensational. <br /> <br />It was really great to see The Eagles live for the second time; I had last seen them play together (and with Joe Walsh) in the mid 70's at Melbourne's old Festival Hall, where The Beatles had performed a decade earlier! <br /> <br />Anyhow, I just loved hearing their great old songs again (and some new ones), but we had to wait till the encores until we finally heard \\"Take It Easy\\" and \\"Hotel California\\" - two of my all-time favourite Eagles hits. <br /> <br />Before the two to three hour concert started, we were told that they were making a DVD for release in 2005. <br /> <br />Can't wait to buy it, folks. <br />I know you'll get to love and like what I saw live, too!
B0006L16N8|5.0|Parachutes was promising. A Rush of Blood To The Head was on the whole (one or two songs were lacking) was great.  X and Y perhaps does not improve on A RUSH yet manages to stand as a strong album in Coldplay's discography.  This is justified in songs such as FIX YOU, WHAT IF, WHITE SHADOWS, A MESSAGE, LOW and TWISTED LOGIC which are as good as Coldplay has ever recorded. No, its not KID-A; no, its not DARK SIDE OF THE MOON; and no, its not SGT PEPPERS.  Its X&Y, and while it does not reinvent pop music as we know it, it reminds us all how engaging and effective pop music can be.   <br /> <br />IF YOU LIKE THIS ALSO CHECK OUT: U2: The Unforgettable Fire (1984), NICK DRAKE: Five Leaves Left (1970), PINK FLOYD: Meddle (1971) and RADIOHEAD: The Bends (1995)
B00097A5I6|5.0|Well, we all waited for 3 years to get this, and the day finally came.  And what a day.  I must admit that any time a new Oasis cd comes out I want to take the day off from work, and take a personal holiday.  And had I, it would have been well worth it. <br /> <br />Oasis are at their best when they stick to what makes them great, mainly - their attitude.  And right from the start, you get it right in your face with Turn Up The Sun.  A real rocker, Andy Bell has written a gem here.  With a nice subtle intro, you don't expect the hard rock tune that this is.  An awesome song! <br /> <br />Mucky Fingers, this is unlike anything Noel has done in the past.  this has a definite Bob Dylan from it, and I LOVE the off the rail train sounding harmonica in the middle.  Brilliant! <br /> <br />Lyla is great, a perfect first single.  Liam brings his first of 3 songs next with Love Like a Bomb.  This one took a few listens, but it's grown on me.   <br /> <br />I absolutely dig Noel's next track, The Importance of Being Idle.  This guys incredible, and shows his range hitting some impressive falsetto in this track.  Gem calls this one a whimsical track, in the best meaning of the word.. I agree! <br /> <br />The Meaning of Soul - wow.. Liam, couldn't you have made this longer?  Wow, this is an incredible song, simple and to the point.  You'll find yourself turning the volume up on this one! <br /> <br />Part of the Queue.. probably my favorite song when I first went thru the cd.  A classic Noel tune, kind of Angel Child, meets Morning Glory... ? <br /> <br />Andy Bell comes back on the next song, Keep the Dream Alive.. best chorus on the album.  And Gem's A Bell Will Ring is a very positive, upbeat song that'll stick in your head.  Well done. <br /> <br />Let There Be Love - this track was a demo on SOTSOG, called It's a Crime. I loved it then, but I adore it now.. Noel has re-written the lyrics beautifully.  The song has a definite Beatles feel to it, and yet is a true Oasis track.  You can't help but get goose bumps when Noel comes in on vocals half way thru.  And Liam's voice is at it's best in this song. <br /> <br />The album's not perfect, but it's exactly what I was hoping for.  I hope they don't wait another 3 years to come out with their next effort.. and hopefully Noel puts out that long awaited solo album.  Cheers!
B0000669JL|3.0|Bob is crucial.  And though I understand some folks are looking for a \\"safe\\" intro to his music, all his records are safe.  Legend is not a necessary buy.  Better to purchase one of Bob's lp's the way he conceived it... to follow the meditation from the first to last song.  and again, there is no dissapointing album, or track from the man.  Kaya, Exodus, Rastaman Vibration, Burnin', Catch a Fire, etc...  <br />stick to the island records recordings at first. (though Trojan Records has a nice mini box compilation of his earlier recordings) you won't be sorry.  and legend will become the one you play the least.
B000068QY7|5.0|After the commercial \\"failure\\" of Standing on the Shoulder of Giants, Oasis return to a more familiar sound with Heathen Chemistry.  And they score another home run.    Oasis is all about their attitude, and their arrogance, and ultimately simple and pure rock and roll.  And they get things rolling nicely right off the bat with Hindu Times.  A great anthem here.  Noel should get alot of credit for the next track, Force of Nature.. this sounds like no other previous Oasis track.  Noel doesn't hold back singing this track.  It's a true rocker, and appropriately titled.    Songbird is great, a real step up for Liam in his songwriting.  And possibly his greatest song, Born on A Different Cloud is right towards the end of this album.      For anyone just looking for a flat out, great rock album you can crank up, and sing along too, buy this.  There aren't many bands out there that can put out great cd's as consistently as Oasis.
B000078DOI|5.0|The Red Hot Chili Peppers built up a gradual fanbase throughout the Eighties. It took three studio albums from them to develop a trademark style, which was improved on each album they released. In August 1989 they released \\"Mother's Milk,\\" which was by far their greatest album up until this point. Two years later they went international with the massive, million-selling classic \\"Blood Sugar Sex Magik,\\" which was a more funky rock orientated album, and a bit more polished. The difference between these two albums is incredible in terms of style. Hillel Slovak died in June 1988 of a heroin overdose, and left a gaping hole in the band. When Mother's Milk was released a year later, the line up consisted of Anthony Kiedis, John Frusciante, Flea and Chad Smith.<br /><br />The album was a financial and commercial success, going Gold in the US and sending the band on a nine month world tour. It took me quite a while to get into this album, because I wasn't used to the harder element of their music when I bought it. I'll say one thing though: this album is amazing! It's also absolutely crazy! The speed of some songs, the pure energy, the unadulterated sexuality and the funk is just amazing. I don't think I've ever heard an album quite as loud and proud as this one! It's not my favourite Chili Peppers album, but it's still amazing.<br /><br />It opens with the superb \\"Good Time Boys.\\" This song has a funky bass intro that soon descends into an all-out rock anthem. The youthful exuberance is expressed in the lyrics, \\"Don't believe in age, travel 'round the world getting naked on the stage.\\" The chorus is a pure chant that you just want to sing loud with your fist in the air. Very good opener. The Stevie Wonder cover \\"Higher Ground\\" is up next. This is widely considered as the best cover version of a Stevie song ever released. The blend of funk and rock here is amazing with a beat that seems to undulate and swirl around in your mind. Great to sing when drunk, I find! \\"Subway To Venus\\" has drums and a bass that will rip your head apart, and the trumpet cleverly seals it back together, just so you can survive the rest of the song. This song is absolutely insane and I bloody love it. This is a song to jump around your room like a nutter to! If you thought the album couldn't get any more energised, prepare yourself because \\"Magic Johnson\\" could well give you a heart attack! The speed at which the boys sing on this song is incredible and hardly fathomable. They sing about the LA Lakers with such excitement you'd think their heads were going to explode. Anthony is particularly brilliant here.<br /><br />\\"Nobody Weird Like Me\\" has a crazy-ass bass that will have you dancing around like a loony. This song chugs along at supersonic speed like a train, occasionally slowing down for the magnificent chorus before speeding up for the rest of the song. \\"Knock Me Down\\" is a bit of a slower song, which adds variety to the album. This song was written about the death of Hillel. It carries a strong message about life, with great lyrics such as, \\"If you see me getting mighty, if you see me getting high, knock me down! I'm not bigger than life.\\" The chorus is quite melodic too. This song was also a huge evolution for the band, because it brought a new melodic chord change that wasn't evident in any of the band's previous work. At the time, it was an immense new element to the sound of the band and a big opening for a new thing for them. The final minute also features some haunting female vocals that add texture to the song. \\"Taste The Pain\\" is one of my lesser favourite songs on the album, but it's still a fine cut with a melodic chorus. \\"Stone Cold Bush\\" is an absolute classic, with a crazy bass and a heavy drum section making this a strong cut. The chorus is very melodic, and the way the guitars stomp after the chorus is incredible. I also love Anthony's chanting of \\"Ay-ay-ay-ay-ay!\\" at the start of the song!<br /><br />\\"Fire\\" is a short song at just over two minutes, and a cover of the Jimi Hendrix original. This song has an energy to it that just blows me away every time I hear it. It's loud and raw in just over two minutes. I didn't think it were possible to cram so much beautiful sound into just 123 seconds! \\"Pretty Little Ditty\\" is a simple instrumental, but boy, what an instrumental. This has to be one of the best songs the band have ever recorded. The melody is fresh, deep and natural. The guitars are just amazing, and this has been sampled by CrazyTown's \\"Butterfly.\\" The song frequently changes speed and tempo, which makes for a great rock piece. \\"Punk Rock Classic\\" is not really one of my favourites because it's just a little too crazy for my liking! It's about the band not conforming to society's rules and expectations, and how they really don't need fame and fortune. How ironic that things would change so dramatically for them two years later. And do I also detect a hint of \\"Sweet Child O' Mine\\" at the end? \\"Sexy Mexican Maid\\" is another great track, and a bit slower than the other songs. There always seems to be a song that portrays the strong sexuality of a woman on the band's albums, and this is this album's. It's a great song with some funky chanting in the background after the chorus. The album closes with \\"Johnny, Kick A Hole In The Sky.\\" This song has a funky bass and some heavy guitars. The verses are really cool, and the female-sung chorus is incredibly catchy.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 10/10<br /><br />This CD is remastered with tons of extra tracks (okay, so there's six, but that's more than most remastered albums!) that really make this a worthwhile purchase for true Red Hot Chili Peppers fans. This album took me quite a while to get into, but now I'm in it, I never want to leave! One of my aspirations in life is to see the band live in concert, because it really would be one of the best days of my entire life! This band has kinda changed my life, and opened me up to more rock music. Mother's Milk is a crazy, insane, energetic, youthful album, yet also poignant, beautiful and powerful as it is dedicated entirely to the memory of Hillel Slovak. It's easy to see why many Chili Peppers fans consider this to be the true pinnacle of the band's brilliance. I would disagree, but this album is so amazing that in time I too could be hailing it as their best work.imi Hendrix original.

B000003TA4|2.0|<br />To the teenager going through her stage of obsession with Nirvana and Kurt Cobain: It won't last, kid. All of us (myself included) went through that stage. When Muddy Banks was released it made me realize this band was a total mess. They couldn't play worth sh*t live. For some strange reason, Unplugged is the exception to that rule, but still, respecting Nirvana truly is a waste of admiration. Kurt hated his fans, and his live music shows. I guess he loved MTV though. His Unplugged show was quite listenable. The MTV execs scored him some black tar before the show started, so I supposed he felt an obligation to put on a good show for the network that undeservedly made him a superstar. <br /> <br />Nirvana were a band of myth and no substance. But substance abuse was a different story. They had tons of that. <br />
B0000019PA|4.0|I ordered this and waited weeks for delivery. It was worth it though.  This is a great album, with one caveat: Jeff Magnum's voice is, to put it charitably, \\"strained\\". It cracks and breaks at the worse times, particularly on \\"Two Headed Boy\\". Not the best instrument for his material, and I'd love to hear ITAOTS redone with another vocalist. That said however, this is still one of my favourites, one I listen to repeatedly. I'm in my mid-fifities and lately I've discovered bands I'd never heard of that are really good, bands which reference music that I liked in the 60s and 70s. Among these are NMH, Apples in Stereo, and my current fave The Sadies. Buy this album folks, it's better than a lot of the stuff I liked back then, and most of the stuff out now. It takes a few listenings to get into, but once you do.... Enjoy.
B0001FR3IG|4.0|Had I read much of the description for this film I probably wouldn't have rented it.  But I fell for the name and expected something in the spooky monster genre.  Of course I also fell for the Halle Berry name, so maybe I would have rented it anyway.  Whatever the reason, what I didn't expect was a 'psychologist gets locked up in a mental institution under suspicion of chopping her husband into little bits' film.  I like procedural thrillers much more than I like psychological thrillers.<br /><br />But, something happened on the way to the plot, and the more I watched, the more I liked what I saw.  You see, there's a ghost.  One who is trying to get Miranda (Berry) to do something, but has nearly destroyed the brilliant psychologist in the process.  There are quite a few plot turns before the climax.  No doubt you will guess some part of the resolution, but probably only because you will make many guesses and one has to be right.<br /><br />The film builds slowly as Miranda fights for her sanity and tries to convince people who were once her friends that she is not a cold blooded psychotic.  Red herrings are used to keep the viewer guessing and unprepared for the sudden rush of the last third of the film.  At this point Berry has screams, and you will have jumped, so many times that you will be in a somewhat stunned shock.<br /><br />Everybody in this film is spooky.  The most glaring fault is how the real story took place with no one noticing,  But that may very well be one of the points of the film.  Cinematography is excellent and really does capture the 'gothic' flavor hidden in a thoroughly modern institution set somewhere in rural America.  Berry's acting (and most of this film is Berry's acting) is really quite good considering the genre.<br /><br />This isn't a hack and slash film, but there are bloody bits.  It's a bit like a low key Silence of Lambs with a dash of Brian Lumley's early Necroscope novels.  Unfortunately, the film ends on a hook - a vague indication of sequels to come.  I hope this doesn't happen because it would cheapen the effectiveness of the work done here.ague indication of sequels to come.

B000000H40|5.0|Like Brandon Wetzel below, I only recently got into Obituary, and it love it! Lyrically, they aren't the best death metal band, but the lyrics are violent, making them the first gore metal band (Cannibal Corpse is another example of gore metal). This was the first Obituary album I got, and I must say, it's a great place to start. John Tardy's vocals are what really separate Obituary from other death metal bands. Many d/m vocalists use the so-called \\"cookie-monster\\" growls, but Tardy uses a scream that recalls early Death (R.I.P. Chuck). James Murphy is one of the most underrated guitar geniuses on the planet! It's a shame he was only on this album, he's arguably the finest guitarist Obituary ever had! There is also good rhythm work from Trevor (forget his last name), great bass-lines from Frank (also forgot his last name), and great drumming from Donald \\"D.T.\\" Tardy, John's brother. If you like death metal, you'll love this. If you like nu-metal/metalcore, as Brandon said, don't bother. Favorite song is \\"Chopped In Half\\".<br /><br />Pete's ratings:<br /><br />1. Infected(5/5)<br /><br />2. Body Bag(5/5)<br /><br />3. Chopped In Half(6/5)<br /><br />4. Circle Of The Tyrants (Celtic Frost cover)(5/5)<br /><br />5. Dying(5/5)<br /><br />6. Find The Arise(5/5)<br /><br />7. Cause Of Death(5/5)<br /><br />8. Memories Remain(5/5)<br /><br />9. Turned Inside Out(5/5)<br /><br />[Not gonna include the demos, they're basicly the same songs]
B00080ZG10|4.0|\\"The Aviator\\" is not one of Scorsese's greatest but it is very good overall, somewhere in between \\"Color of Money\\" and \\"Last Temptation of Christ,\\" and as full-bodied as \\"Kundun.\\" I saw the film twice in theatres, and the second time proved just as good and enveloping. Di Caprio's Hughes will get on your nerves and burn a hole through your head - he is compelling and frustrating to watch during his OCD spells.<br /><br />The two-disc edition is superb. There is the history channel documentary, the OCD panel discussion with Scorsese, Di Caprio and others, a look at the music and visual effects, and lots more to peruse (still watching these features as we speak). The commentary is insightful (as one would hope from Scorsese, Schoonmaker and Michael Mann). I only wish the film had the DTS soundtrack but you can't have everything.<br /><br />If you like any and everything having to do with Howard Hughes, then check out THE AVIATOR. The film will keep you on the edge of your seat and the bloody plane crash is one of the most horrific in detail ever put on film. Di Caprio has established himself as a truly terrific actor. A must-see.<br /><br />For more info on Scorsese, check out [...]
B00097A5HW|1.0|..I mean seriously...$15 for a hockey puck? That's a shamem, as it's a very good and useful puck. But you'll need to replace it every so often as it breaks. They should be thicker....<br /><br />No wait! This ain't a hockey puck, it's a music CD!
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|Wow, this album really confirmed my love for System of a Down. My first album of theirs was \\"Toxicity\\", which I purchased after hearing \\"Chop Suey!\\". I loved it. At the time the political lyrics and deep meaning soared right over my head, as I was only 11, but I loved the lyrics reading them just as straight-forward, non-metaphorical lyrics (and again, I didn't even know what the word \\"metaphor\\" meant at the time), as well as the vocal harmonies, and the music. Back then I, pretty much along with the rest of the world, was in the Nu-Metal phase, so SOAD was right up there with Papa Roach, Korn and Linkin Park. I proceeded to buy their debut album, as well as \\"Steal This Album!\\" when it was released in 2002, leaving a 3 year gap before that and this, their new masterpiece. Now, in that time, my musical tastes have grown, and nowadays I'd prefer to listen to Primus or Opeth before most nu-metal bands (hey, I still have my guilty pleasures). So I guess I kinda forgot about ol' SOAD, as they were more or less clogged in with the rest of the disposable Nu-Metal bands of their times. So what did I think when I heard they were having a new album, let alone a double one, sometime in 2005? Well, I'm pretty sure I thought something like \\"that will be an interesting listen\\" (not sarcastic though, I'm sure that sounded like it). I couldn't wait to see if SOAD took the Papa Roach route and followed along with the emo trend, or see if they got more metal, or stayed the same. They did none of the above. SOAD took their sound, tweaked it just a bit more, experimented A LOT, and are now in a genre of their own. <br /> <br />The album's first single, \\"B.Y.O.B.\\", probably caught your attention, as well as the rest of the America's, because it fuelled the albums sales enough to land it at the number one mark on the billboards. The song is definitely one of the quirkiest tunes SOAD's ever written. Of course, it starts out like good ol' SOAD, heavy riffs, stop start timings, spastic vocals, but then, for the chorus, we're hit with this beach-party sounding pop-rock part, something most bands couldn't get away with, but SOAD pulls it off perfectly and make you wanna listen again and again. And don't forget the powerful lyrics...honestly, why DO they always send the poor?  <br /> <br />This album also features more of a contribution from Daron, the guitarist, who, on previous albums, acted as more of a background vocalist, but on this album, he'll either sing the majority of the songs, or harmonize at equal volumes with Serj. Now, in songs like \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" and \\"Lost in Hollywood\\" this works beautifully, but Daron's voice can get annoying and too high pitched at times. Personally, I can't stand the way he squeals the \\"My c*** is much bigger than yours\\" lines in \\"Cigaro\\" and when he sings \\"Danny and Lisa\\" and his voice gets just a bit too high when he sings \\"Lisa\\" the last time before the guitar solo in \\"Radio / Video\\". Now, let's say Serj was never with SOAD to begin with, and it was always Daron on lead vocals, it wouldn't be that bad, because he DOES have a good voice, but think of what we're comparing it to here. Listen to the song \\"Question!\\", a song which Serj sings entirely by himself, the listen to any track with Daron singing, and it'll be painfully obvious. Daron just can't match Serj vocally. I'm hoping, like many other reviewers here, that Serj gets more vocal time on \\"Hypnotize\\", the group's soon-to-be-released second part of this 2-disc set. We can only wait and hope. <br /> <br />Not only does Daron get more singing time on this outing, he also wrote all the music entirely by himself, except for \\"Question!\\", which Serj also wrote music for. Daron also writes most of the lyrics himself, with the exception of co-writing with Serj on a few tracks, and \\"Question!\\", which Serj wrote the lyrics for entirely by himself. I don't have a problem with this. The songs are what this album is all about. What I love so much about this album is the experiment-ism. SOAD mixes metal and hard rock with just about any other genre you can think of, and \\"B.Y.O.B.\\" is a great example of this. One second it's a beach party dance part, then 3 seconds later you're hit with this death metal frenzy part, only to be taken back to a melodic verse, followed again by a beach party chorus, etc. \\"Cigaro\\" features some rather, err, interesting lyrics. I'd like to see another metal band have enough humor to write a tune like this, and STILL give it a deep metaphorical meaning. The track's about the self-absorbed business men of America, taking more pride in the size of their packages than anything else. In \\"Radio / Video\\", another highlight of the album, the group experiments with reggae, making it a truly memorable song, and the dual vocals of Serj and Daron really work well in this song, even though I have no idea what they're singing about with \\"Danny and Lisa\\". Track number six, \\"This Cocaine Makes Me Feel Like I'm On This Song\\", is a short return to their roots, as it's pretty much a straight forward, fast paced metal tune, complete with the quirky lyrics and Serj's insane spasm-esque vocals. \\"Question!\\" is truly a beautiful song, no doubt about it. The music, lyrics, and vocals in this one are flawless. \\"Sad Statue\\" also features a beautiful chorus and memorable chorus. The album's last track, \\"Lost in Hollywood\\", is the album's ballad, a track which I do believe Daron sung very well. It's a haunting yet beautiful song, a song telling of the dreams shattered in Hollywood and the lies people are told there just so they can be used to make money off of. It's definitely not a happy tune, but like \\"Aerials\\" from \\"Toxicity\\", it ends the album on a haunting but beautiful note and in the end it works out for the best. <br /> <br />Each of the tracks on this album really are memorable, I just named what I see as the main highlights. The hardest thing to do for me is to remember how each individual track on an album goes, and I can do that with this album. This is a record I can't wait to listen to again. For a band as successful and mainstream as SOAD, they're still amazingly talented musicians, more than likely the most talented musicians to have been on the Top 10 in the Billboards in a looooooooong time. All metal / hard rock fans, as well as music coinsurers should pick this album up. It's an early contender for record of the year, no doubt about it.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I am officially addicted to \\"X&Y.\\" This CD plays like a great movie. It has these great cinematic melodies with larger than life orchestral like sounds. This album has more of an epic quality. It just operates on a grander scale. \\"X&Y\\" could be a feature soundtrack. It's so Oscar worthy. Coldplay created something that has more than one dimension. I just feel like there are so many different levels and reveals. At times it's very intricate with lots of little flourishes and details. This CD requires repeat listening just to absorb it all. The title is sweet and simple, but the overall texture is inherently complex. The presentation is very straightforward and it all blends and flows very well. Therefore, it's very accessible and enjoyable. But if you really pay attention, you'll discover different geometries. It's not redundant. All of their songs are very interesting. Their music draws you in and takes you places that you'd never expect. It's like a great fairy tale at times.

B000003S5H|5.0|Someone recently recommended \\"Air\\" to me...I listened to a couple of samples and I am HOOKED!! This was the first album I got and it is BRILLIANT! From what I understand, this album (Moon Safari) and Talkie Walkie are two of their best...so I have both and I just cannot stop listening to them! I really don't quite know how to describe their sound...it is just...well...DIFFERENT, but magnificently so!!. French pop? Retro? Jazzy? Sexy? Listen to this music and you'll find yourself closing your eyes and swaying to the rhythm with an inner smile, as if you've been hypnotized into another world of gentle happy pleasure...
B000000OAH|4.0|\\"Jazz\\" could very well be compared to the Beatles White Album in the fact that the band set aside their outrageous over-the-top production values of \\"A night at the opera\\", and \\"A Day at the races\\" and went about record a large collection of unique songs that all sound completely different and original. \\"Jazz\\" borrows from a plethora of musical styles, and at times, sounds a bit dysfunctional. But if this is dysfunctional...then dysfunctional me up, baby!  All of the cuts are solid with no filler, but standouts are the thunderous opening of \\"Mustapha\\" \\"Let me Entertain You\\", \\"Dreamers Ball\\" and the pure Queen pop of \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\". This effort, as with any of the first five or six Queen releases, would be an excellent staring point for the Queen novice. \\"Jazz\\" is a bit more polished than the first two album's the band released, but Queen has always been a highly polished, professional recording act that has never been sucessfully imitated. For younger folks who are fans of Jellyfish's \\"Spilt Milk\\", Queen is right up your ally.
158799190X|1.0|I went into this book with high expectations, especially based on the reviews the book has gotten and the high praise heaped upon it.  I don't remember the last time I was so disappointed by a book.<br /><br />The author provides surperficial, arrogant criticism of some people, notably traders and George Will, and paises people with superficial, poorly reasoned complements.<br /><br />The book is arrogant and too long, by the 10th page you could put the book down and not miss anything the author has to say.
B000063DFN|4.0|Fresh on the heels of \\"Piece of Mind\\" which was the best Maiden album to date \\"Powerslave\\" picks up where the band left off. \\"Piece of Mind\\" offered the world the talents of drummer Nicko McBrain propelling the band to even more reckless abandon, the album somehow up'd the ante even more with eight  tightly woven songs. The albums first six cuts put plenty of distance between themselves and their metal contemporaries of the day with the most advanced compositions in metal to date without resorting to the then popular trend of neo-classical arrangements. Each of the first six songs cook under intense pressure with vocal melodies being sublime. Maiden's galloping style of rock has never been more fierce than in \\"Aces High' and \\"Flash of the Blade\\". \\"2 minutes to midnight\\" offers the listener some of the band's best lyrics. Clocking in at over 50 minutes the albums is very long by the vinyl LP standards of the day with \\"Rime of the Ancient Mariner\\" coming in at 13+ minutes. Iron Maiden's song topics have always put them ahead of the heavy metal pack by not insulting the listener with juvenile song topics (ie: 'something evil in the sky' a la' Dio garbage) but offering up serious topics of historical and social commentary without the goofy pseudo-intellectualism of many progressive metal bands bringing them on par with other hard rockin' bands with brains (most notably Blue Oyster Cult). One of the best 80s metal albums period. Production values are clean and bright and burns white hot.
B000002JB8|5.0|As the typical health care worker, I spend a large part of my work day in a state of stress.  My particular mode of escape is to come home, get in the pool with a beer and our two golden retrievers, then put on a CD like this one.  The songs transport you to a place where all you hear is the sweet melodies of the ocean; all you smell is the sea air and all you feel is a cool, briny breeze and sand under your toes!  I think the rather silly cover art on the album throws alot of people but trust me, if you are looking for relaxation music with a \\"watery\\" theme, you have found it.
B000063DHL|4.0|Following their earlier studio effort \\"powerslave\\" and a double live Lp, \\"Somewhere in Time\\" brings Iron Maiden back to the public with another eight solid tunes. This album's concept finds the band's 'mascot' Eddie deep into the future and still kicking major butt just as he did in the 20th century. The album feature more of guitarist Adrian Smith's work with three of the eight songs penned by the often overlooked songwriter. Smith waste no time in putting together one of the band's all-time favorites \\"Wasted Years\\" via track #2. Martin \\"Masa\\" Birch produces another set of killer sounds for the band with most songs being on par with each other giving the listener an incredibly solid collection of songs. \\"Somewhere in Time\\" unlike previous Maiden efforts, to me, laid flat at first but with each listen the melodies sink deeper and deeper. Within six months the album became one of my all-time favorite Iron Maiden efforts.
B000002HMH|3.0|Yeah, it's a alright album, but it began what would become Metallica's downfall. The black album's sucess killed them, with them going more for airwaves on the radio, it sld them cd's at first, but eventually led to St Anger. They go in a different direction, but it more sounds like 70's hard rock. Instead of making there own voice, i feel it's more copying someone elses. if your into the thrash on the older metallica albums, you will not find it here. The instrument parts are more watered down, as well as the production is unfortunally, which is a shame because with a few different settings and a different direction this could of been a fantastic album. Overall, alright album, maybe one to download :D
B0009I7NNA|4.0|Yeah, so there's none of that on this, the latest release from A7X, if you think that means it sucks feel free to smack yourself over the head with the nearest heavy object. <br /> <br />Ahem... at any rate. <br /> <br />I'd like to state first-off that I absolutely disagree with the sentiment \\"If you're an Avenged Sevenfold fan, don't buy this album.\\" Different though it may be, it is very much full of all the things that made A7X a great band in the first place.  Growls or not, Shadows still belts out as powerful a vocal delivery as ever, if not moreso.  City may is a bit less extreme, but it still rocks thoroughly in its own right. <br /> <br />As far as people screaming that the band has \\"sold out\\", please refer to the opening paragraph of this review, and repeat as necessary to purge yourself of stupidity (take your time, I'll wait). <br /> <br />What it comes down to is that while City of Evil might be a bit different than A7X's previous releases, it's manages to be a great album.  The band seems very tight and comfortable with the new material, marking a steady improvement in them as writers and musicians.  They're playing to their strengths here, which do not lie solely in Shadow's abilit to growl.  If anything, City is somewhat more enjoyable than previous efforts in that it comes off as much more cohesive as far as the flow of the music.  Make no mistake, they still manage to inject a nice ammount of variety into the songs even with a slightly streamlined approach. City of Evil is a consumation, not a compromise, and a very promising 3rd outing from a very talented young band. <br /> <br />So basically, if you still think City sucks because there are no growls on it, or if you think A7X \\"sold out\\", please keep hitting yourself.  If, however, you are a fan of well-executed, tasty hard rock music, feel free to grab this album.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|This is now one of my favorite movies of all time! My choir director at my high school is a huge fan of the stage show, and he bought the DVD and brought it to school and showed it to us. I went and bought it the next weekend. This movie is essential for anyone who likes music at all to see! The music is catchy, haunting, and just plain beautiful. The actors all did a great job, and sang very well. The DVD has some nice features on it. This 2- Disc set has very good commentary, and a hilarious sing-along with the cast and crew feature. The presentation of this movie is unbelievable. Just the scenery is absolutely gorgeous, from snowy rooftops to dark graveyards, every scene is memorable. This movie is very romantic, and is a great date movie. If you like any music at all, do yourself a favor and pick this one up. But, be warned: these songs could be stuck in your head for a long time. Enjoy!
B0006L16N8|3.0|True, not bad, with some great songs and excellent arrangements; however, the lyrics are mind-numbingly banal and thier next album really will need to break new ground lest these guys turn into the highest paid elevator musicians in the world.
B000088E7Y|5.0|Besides \\"Exile on Main Street,\\" this is the 2nd best album ever made.  The songwriting is amazing, and it is an unbelievable record to drink to.  Just ask my friend Myles--a no-nonsense kind of guy.  He's into Puerto Rican women, big jungle cats, hanging out without his shirt on, and paintings of race cars.  He'll rock you.  Hard.
B00005NTNU|5.0|All 5 movies, extras included on the orignal include all 5 trailers back-to-back.
B000065DWH|5.0|\\"Exile on Main Street\\" is the greatest album ever made.  \\"Good Old Boys\\" is a close second.  Like \\"Exile\\", this is also a musical journey through the American South.  Anyway, I am whacked out on Ambien right now and don't feel like writing too much about the amazing songwriting on this record.  Just understand that Newman is one of our most important composers and the fact that he writes scores for movies like \\"Meet the Fockers,\\" should be overlooked.  The man needs to make a living. <br /> <br />\\"Good Old Boys\\" is also a great record to drink to.  Just as my friend Myles.  He is a killer diller from the dirty dirty.  Myles is hard into \\"Cougars\\" (women over the age of 40), huffing gasoline, books on tape, big jungle cats, paintings of race cars, and hanging out without his shirt on.  He is a no-nonsense kind of dude.  I am pretty sure you can find Myles hanging out in his San Francisco apartment shirtless right now with a mean scotch buzz, the body of a decomposing bobcat or lynx in his basement fridge, a 46 year old woman chained to his staircase, and Randy Newman's \\"Good Old Boys\\" blasting at an uncomfortable volume from his alarm clock/CD player.
B000021YQV|5.0|This is simply an incredible album. The songs have a stunning mix of a super heavy sound coupled with very melodic sound. I encourage anyone who has any interest in metal to get this album!
B000002OAZ|3.0|This album was my introduction to the Wolf, and I loved it. It was after I had heard some of his other work and then came back to the London Sessions that I found myself disappointed. Howlin' Wolf possessed the most distinctive voice in blues--a genre full of distinct voices. The London Sessions feature a fairly ill, and rather old Howlin' Wolf, and he simply doesn't have the raw power that he possessed on earlier albums. The songs on this album are good as always, and the Rolling Stones' rhythm section, the Eric Clapton guitar work, give Wolf an updated rock feel. If you're looking for classic blues songs with a slightly smoother feel and production, this is definitely a great purchase. But if you want Wolf at his most powerful, check out something earlier, like \\"Moanin' in the Moonlight\\".
B000002P5W|3.0|Are You Experienced was a groundbreaking record.  It would be very hard for Jimi Hendrix, Noel Redding, and Mitch Mitchell to duplicate such an effort.  However, there are plenty of strong moments on Axis:  Bold As Love.<br /><br />The title track is probably the strongest track.  The melody is quite captivating and the tones shift very nicely from loud to soft.  A good drum sequence transitions the song to a enjoyable conclusion.<br /><br />Little Wing is probably the most familiar tune for those not so familiar with Hendrix tunes.  Its a song that touches on Jimi's sensitive side.  You've Got Me Floating has a nice groove if a limited melody  Wait Until Tommorow has a hip chorus with nice backing vocals.  She's So Fine touches on the psychedelic as Noel Redding gives that flavor with his vocal style.<br /><br />The remaining songs are certainly pretty good even if their melodies are not overly captivating.  The guitar playing is solid if not overly varied.  Nonetheless, a solid three-three and a half star rating sounds fair.
B0007INZXO|3.0|With a new Radiohead album mounths away, I thought the new Coldplay ablum X and Y was sure to keep me well through the summer, However I was very wrong. Before I go on I want to say I do love Coldplay and have been a fan since there start, I highly recomend both Parachutes, A Rush of blood to the head, and their b-sides, but I found that their new album was I huge let down. Before I tell you the bad about the album it does have some good. The music has really started to sound alot more modern, and up to date, most compare it's sound to that to Kid A, but I really wouldn't go that far. Now for the bad the two main flaws with this album are though the music improved Chris really neglected the lyric writing, where is the touching emotionally charged lyrics that make me weep durring the scientist? Come on \\"You and me are on a tidal wave, We're in outer space.\\" those are very dry. Secondly Coldplay borrows from to many other people it's cool to have influences but if you rely on them to deeply you lose your own voice and sound. I mean have you people seen Chris Martin I love him to death, but he look like he wants to become Thom Yorke frontman of Radiohead. Sorry about all the Radiohead jargin, but in the end this album is only for hardcore fans, so if your a new listener pick up Parachutes, or A Rush of Blood to the head.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|This CD isnt bad but it's doesnt live up to walken the fallen which is pretty much a masterpiece.  One thing I've noticed is that when bands change (sell out) 99% of the time its for the worst. Hence S.T.P., Sugar Ray, and of course Metallica theres more too. Take Slayer for instance they really haven't changed much and they still kick ass after what 20yrs. <br />The fisrt time I heard this disk I was like WTF? What happened? Then I listened to it again and it started to get better. This CD has grown on me but its still not a 5 star. I have to disagree and say this isnt the biggest let down as one of the other reviewers said. The biggest let down ever was \\"Saint Anger\\" what a pile of GARBAGE. I think that they should get someone to scream and yell for Shadows. Beacause without that it seems like they sold out. It's still is A7X just without screaming and yelling and a slight bit mellower.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|I don't want to deal with all those Radiohead comparisons other than to say the similarity begins and ends with the unique vocals and imaginative music.  There is no rip-off going on - just a rarely attained level of excellence that these two bands share. <br /> <br />Muse, however, completely rocks in every way.  All 3 players are top notch and Matthew Bellamy goes beyond competence and is the kind of virtuoso and innovator on guitar, vocals AND keyboard that Pete Townshend was, minus the lyrical genius of Pete. <br /> <br />This is not to say that the lyrics are bad, though - they're actually pretty good.  What is amazing is the unbridled intensity of the music - it does not let up. <br /> <br />This music is in your face, all the time, while still being accessible.  Progressive or art rock, which is what some would consider this, often sounds contrived, particularly with plodding beats and tempos changes thrown in solely to impress.  Not here.  This music flows and some tunes make you want to dance!  Amazing for music this dense! <br /> <br />If you want to be inspired in a way that only happens once every few years, Absolution is for you.  Few bands are truly awesome - Muse, at least here, awes me.
1400032717|3.0|Everybody else loved this book, and I really wanted to love it too. And after having finished it, I can say this: I liked it, but it didn't carry an emotional punch. The protagonist (and author) is clearly very clever, and it was an interesting read... but that's it. The problem with writing a book about a character who does not understand emotions is that it's hard to get emotionally invested in him or the people he describes. I sat through his descriptions of his father and mother and teacher, and I saw that they were emotional about things, and I know I was *supposed* to feel similar emotions... But when the conduit through which I experience their emotions is a boy who has very little understanding of feelings, every character becomes sort of flat, and I can't get very invested in them.<br /><br />In my opinion, this kind of thing was handled much better in Ender's Shadow by Orson Scott Card. There, the main character understood why other people felt emotions, but he didn't really feel much himself. Through the book, however, he grew, and by the end he became overwhelmed by these surprising emotions he didn't know he could feel. And I felt the emotions with him, and I cried. That is what I was expecting out of this book, given all the great reviews. But I didn't cry. Like the main character, I didn't feel much of anything, really.<br /><br />This book passed the time, but I wouldn't recommend it when there are so many better books out there.
B0006L16N8|4.0|I realize Coldplay has almost un-godly standards to live up to.  A  Rush of Blood to the Head being the main thing.  That CD was superb, this CD is good and is more of the same.  If you like Coldplay (alot), you'll like this CD.  If you're an average fan, you can't help but be somewhat dissapointed.  I'm somewhere in-between.  Best Tracks:  White Shadows, Fix You, and Kingdom Come.
B0009A1AS2|3.0|I'll start by saying I own the complete DT catalog. Big fan for years....Octavarium is not a bad CD, I just have to agree with many of the reviews here-it covers little NEW ground. The songs contain the excellent DT mucianship, however you are hardpressed to remember any one song , even after SEVERAL listens. The last song (epic)-Octavarium is IMHO the best DT track on this CD, but plods along for several minutes before it becomes a decent piece. LeBrie and Rudess are the main \\"features\\" on this one, and Myung, Portnoy and Petrucci are background \\"fixtures\\"....This effort appears to be DT's swansong, and if so, does not leave the listener with satisfaction.
B000003N89|5.0|Paying homage to the Nat Cole Trio, the most popular jazz combo of its day, Diana Krall (piano), Russell Malone (guitar), and Paul Keller (bass) bring some long-time favorites and some lesser known Cole Trio hits to life.  The arrangements are terrific, ranging from slow, bluesy numbers, to swing, a torchy ballad, and forties-style jive.  In every case, the emphasis is on the trio, and though Krall sings on every track, more than half of each song is instrumental, with extended solos on piano by Krall and guitar by Russell Malone.<br /><br />Krall's voice is a full, sometimes husky, alto with very little vibrato, and though she can sing scat, and does on \\"Frim Fram Sauce,\\" she is at her best singing slow songs of aching loss, where, occasionally, her phrasing reminds me of Sarah Vaughan.  \\"Gee, Baby, Ain't I Good to You,\\" sung slower than Cole did it, is a sad, bluesy number with wonderful, casual jazz piano riffs.  \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams,\\" my favorite on the album, is torchy, the imagined tears kept under control as Krall pines for lost love, with the piano ranging into chromatic variations.  In \\"You Call It Madness\\" and \\"I'm Through With Love,\\" Krall keeps her voice whispery, singing slowly, almost confidentially, as she maintains the slow beat and melancholy mood.  By contrast, \\"Hit That Jive, Jack,\\" moves in a quick, toe-tapping rhythm, as Krall, Malone, and Keller sing together and have fun.<br /><br />The album has plenty of variety to the selections and features three fine jazz instrumentalists who toured together and perfected their ensemble for several months before recording this album.  With the earthy voice of Krall added to the instrumental mix, this album is certainly one of Krall's best--a huge success.  There are no drums here (except on \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\"), but that is not a limitation, and, in fact, may be an advantage, since the listener's attention remains focused on the tunefulness of the songs and their jazz variations.  This is a fine homage to the Nat Cole Trio, which would have been justly proud of Krall's recording.  Mary Whipplethe Nat Cole Trio, which would have been justly proud of Krall's recording.

B0009A1AS2|2.0|You know, these players are all accomplished musicians, however, the music is so ordinary, uncreative, and unispired. Maybe thats the problem with dream theater, they are so adament about showing off their pedantic 'licks' that their really isn't anything beyond them except the ordinary basic song structure. So...these tunes could be any dream theater tunes: no better, no worse i.e. one song is many songs. And the production of this album stinks: where are the keyboards? Jordon Rudess is probably the best thing going in the band but where is he in most of the songs? so deep in the mix and buried behind the 'chunka chunka chunka' of guitar he seems to be almost non existant. And don't even get me started on their banel lame lyrics...ouch!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When my husband started watching this show I used to laugh hysterically at him and call it 'Amish in Space'. \\"Kids... be quiet, Daddy's show 'Amish in Space' is on.\\"  Unfortunately for me I never paid attention to the actual show, I just saw 6-shooters and space ships, Aliens at the Alhambra saloon.  My husband was devasated when the show was cancelled, so for his birthday I bought him the full series DVDs and I fell in love with Serenity and her crew.  Forgive me for poking fun, I would give up all my other shows (except maybe the new Battlestar Gallactica) if they would just bring this back, or better yet have the Sci-Fi channel pick it up... they have the budget and lord knows they have series' that could be replaced without anyone noticing. <br /> <br />Buy this, be inspired.
B00002ZMNV|5.0|An astonishing synthesis of style. What struck me most was the contrast and resultant symbiosis that can be achieved across genres, age-groups and preconceived notions. As a die-hard classical music fan, questioning who were the musicians and who the technicians was illuminating. My teenage children introduced me to this DVD. I ended up requesting (and receiving) it as a cherished 44th birthday gift.
B0007Y4TVU|1.0|Yah. It's been a few years sense the release of Toxicity and a lot has gone down sense then. 9/11, The invasion of Iraq, the collective re-election of G.Bush. I was expecting more from System of a Down. After hearing their new album I was thuroughly disappointed. I feel so let down, so betrayed. They threw a few songs in there that has some vaguely political lyrics. But for the most part the music sounds like Norwegian Death Metal, and the lyrics are trite! I don't know, maybe I'm too old or too stupid to \\"get it\\", but I like the first album, and after Toxicity and Steel This Album I couldn't weight for next installment of System. But what a disappointment!  You really dropped the ball on this one Serj! I hope you like being out-shined by Green-Day. Maybe next time you'll stop being so introspective and technical and get back to what made you infamous in the first place.
B000001FS3|5.0|Yes, you may recongize my review title as a line from \\"The Shawshank Redemption.\\" I did that on purpose.  <br /> <br />2001 was a terrible year for me. I had just gone through some serious academic trouble in graduate school, and my future was truly in jeopardy. I didn't know which way to turn--everything that I thought was true in my life turned out to be false. I lost my first real girlfriend, I was in a city I hated, I was apart from everyone I cared about, and there was no hope on the horizon.  <br /> <br />As I always do in times of severe stress, I turned to music. I was still just weaning myself off radio, delving into full-length albums. Having always enjoyed U2's big radio hits, I thought I'd ask for \\"Joshua Tree\\" for my 21st birthday.  <br /> <br />Remember, at that time, I was severely depressed. My life had fallen apart (although I had no idea that later my life would be a worse wreck years later--see my other reviews for the rest of the story), and I had no hope.  <br /> <br />As my birthday approached, I began to set my will back to survival. I was going to make it, dammit--I wasn't going to crack just yet. I just needed a soundtrack for my life. That's when I finally got my Joshua Tree CD, and I found the strength I needed.  <br /> <br />And, nearly at the same time I began to explore this wondrous tale of hope and strength, I began to hang out with a girl I met at graduate school. Little did I know, I would very soon be experiencing my first taste of true, maniacal love--and true, suicidal heartbreak years later. But, back to the story.  <br /> <br />Where a few months prior I was broken and bleeding, so to speak, I had now found a source of strength. On Joshua Tree, Bono doesn't tell you everything is going to be alright. He doesn't say you need to stop bitching and be thankful for what you have. No. Bono tells you that life can be horrible, life can shred your soul, life can be an exercise in pure pain. But you can find the strength in your heart to hold on, you can clutch to the cliff for just one more minute. Cry if you need to, bleed if you're being cut, but you CAN keep hope alive. \\"Running to Stand Still\\" is the song I listened to the most in those months of recuperation, realizing that I really can hold on through the pain. And that's when I completely unexpectedly fell in love. That love ended in miserable heartache, but the details are for another review. Let me just say that 2 years later, during the time she and I split up, U2's \\"With or Without You\\" suddenly took on a whole new meaning.  <br /> <br />So, be sure to check this album out. You never know when you'll need it. There have been so many times in my life that music has saved me, and I think Bono, Edge, Adam, and Larry have saved me the most.

B0009AM5JA|2.0|Compared to the band's first two CDs this is a piece of junk.  There is not one single track with the kind of passion present on Parachutes or Rush of Blood To The Head.  Makes me wonder how much time was spent arranging the songs.

B000000OQF|5.0|Picture this: a 15 year old high schooler in the mid 1990s is full of angst, rage, and hormonal passion.  He is gifted with musical ability, and he funnels all his emotion into the guitar and listens to guitar-based music.  At the time, that would entail listening to Nirvana, Stone Temple Pilots, Smashing Pumpkins, and more Nirvana.      Now, that 15 year old kid has mastered playing all those songs, and he wonders if there is a more \\"romantic\\" life somewhere out there, beyond the confines of his suburban dwelling.  Y'know, a life of grit, dirt, and living in the gutter.  A life where you \\"take it day by day,\\" and \\"learn to live like an animal.\\"  But, that kid doesn't want to abandon the anger and rage which has carried him through his adolescence.      That kid was me, obviously.  I had quickly grown tired of playing simple power chords and listening to monotone singers.  So, imagine my utter shock when I heard \\"Paradise City\\" on the radio one day.  What was that?  A 3 minute outro solo?  What is that amazing guitar tone?  And why is the singer reminding me of a banshee out of hell?      After catching a few more AFD radio tunes, I took the plunge and bought this archaic 1980s rock CD.  I could picture Cobain's ghost laughing at me.      I was instantly transfixed.      This was the first album that I actually didn't skip past the non-radio songs.  Every single song is based on a catchy hook, every solo is passionate and meaningful.        I started to scrutinize the back cover of the CD.  These guys were FILTHY and obviously drunkards.  And what's with the names?  Axl Rose?  Slash?  Izzy Stradlin'?  Duff McKagan?  They were like some psychotic knights from a long past era, too crazy to have normal names.  The more I read of their history, the more interested I became in their story.  For the love of god, these guys lived in a rented recording space, sleeping on the floor, stealing money from the girls who \\"visited\\" them!  Such a romantic life, something I was destined never to experience in my suburban, college-bound life.      To this day, I consider AFD to be the pinnacle of a band composing music.  Sorry to the Illusion fans--AFD is pure, unabated, raw anger, full of barely-chained rage.  Just listen to the hatred in Axl's voice when he sings on \\"Rocket Queen,\\" or try the intense emotion of Slash's solos in \\"Nightrain.\\"  And, if you're a guitarist, you really owe it to yourself to hear what Slash can do.  True, his solos are based on standard pentatonic blues, but he puts such emotion into them--I can whistle most of his solos as if they were lyrics.  Also, please don't neglect Izzy; he wrote a great deal of material on this album, and AFD could not exist without him.      AFD is a once-in-humanity achievement.  Some people lament how quickly GNR burned out, but not me.  You need to understand that the intense psychosis in the band is what's responsible for creating AFD--that psychosis also destroyed them.  And if that's the only way AFD could have been created, then that's just fine with me.
6300214354|5.0|It may take a few minutes before Top Secret gets you laughing but once you do you won't stop!  You'll laugh until you slither helplessly off the couch onto the floor -- chill some beer and invite a few friends.  Puns, sight gags, B-movie sendups, and a lot of really clever background stuff.  Sure, some of the gags are a little sophomoric, but they just keep piling 'em on until you can't catch your breath.  I'd forgotten how funny the French Resistance is -- listen carefully for their names...mon Dieu!
B000060P79|1.0|First off.. I just have to say.. why do they pick album names they direct to their girlfriends? I'm sure they ( their girlfriends ) have more balls then these wannabe faggots. I don't even feel like wasting anymore of my time writing a review.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I was one of those who pre-ordered this album a month of Sundays before it was released. It was well worth the wait and Coldplay deliver the goods with such panache that the listener should have bucket loads of pleasure listening to it. <br /> <br />Here are a few observations .... <br /> <br />First, I'm pleased they have not changed direction in musical style. One or two commentators thought that it might be time for them to do so. However, I think they have developed their musical style very nicely. Why change when it isn't broken? The band have just moved it all on a bit - and it works gloriously. <br /> <br />Second, the production has made the sound fuller than before and seems more complete, thus the tracks are even more tuneful and more varied than before. <br /> <br />Third, the first five tracks are out of this world and set the listener up for the rest of the album. In \\"White Shadows\\", and the wonderful \\"Talk\\", the latter daringly using the melody from 'Computer Love', by the sainted Kraftwerk, Coldplay have weaved their magic to produce the best of all the songs. However, there are no duff tracks - all stand out as being worthwhile and not just album fillers. This is very difficult to do, but when an artist or a group pull it off, then you have one magnificent album - as we have here. <br /> <br />Fourth, Chris Martin has a decent voice and so the vocals are excellent. The whole band sound very tight, together and do the songs justice. <br /> <br />Finally, it might not be the best album I have ever bought, but it comes pretty darn close and certainly in my top five. As my collection is a four-figure number, that makes it, in my opinion, damn fine. The acid test will be how much I am playing it in a few months time - I would think I might need a second copy! <br /> <br />So, if you have read and heard the hype, believe it. This is one mega-album and will push other bands into the shade. <br /> <br />Can Coldplay keep it up with their next album? I don'tknow, and anyway, let's soak up the gloriousness of this album first. <br /> <br />Are they the greatest band in the world? I can hear a lot of people saying 'yes'. However, all I know is that they are very, very, very special and I love their music. If everyone else feels the same way, then I bet the band would be very happy with that.
B00008EYA5|3.0|When the mean streets of Los Angeles start spiralling out of control the response from City Hall is to start a new crack SWAT team headed by Dan \\" Hondo \\" Harrelson -played ably by Samuel L Jackson ,despite his being almost visibly on auto-pilot ,so few are thr dramatic demamds of the role .He recruits disgraced former SWAT man Jim Street ( Colin Farrell) and the rest of his team are the politically correct mix of Latino woman ( the always excellent Michelle Rodriguez),black male (L L Cool j ) and another white male officer (Jeremy Renner).This is not merely P.C but an obvious play for the widest possible ethnic appeal to the movie .Indeed ,this is a very calculating and calculated picture -the villain is French ,thus playing to the US dislike of that nation ( a perfectly sensible dislike in my view ;I dont trust them further than i can throw 'em ) <br />The baddie is duly capyured but the fun really starts when he offers $ 100 million to anyone who can bust him out of jail .This is the cue for all hell to break loose -bullets fly ,helicopters explode and cars are driven pell mell on the way to a climax of carnage and blood. <br />The actors all do well even allowing for the miniscule acting demands made upon them but I suspect the ability to look good in combat gear was the prime requirement for their getting the job .The action scenes are staged well and other than a slight saggging in the mid point of the movie this does at least hold the interest  <br />One for those who like heavy metal on the soundtrack ,lots of loud bangs and fast cutting .Subtle it ain't but its okay mindles popcorn movie making and does pass the time in an adequate manner
B00005JLR8|5.0|There is little I can add to what others have said in reviewing this splendid little gem of a movie, but what is so intriguing is that one could make a case for any of the six main characters' being the focal point for the movie.  And certainly a case could be made for at least two of the characters--Christy and Mateo--as being Christ-like symbols.  It is a movie that grows deeper each time one sees it; I recently showed it to one of my college classes, and one student in her paper remarked 'This movie is almost too beautiful, to perfect to write about or discuss, for fear of diminishing it'. <br />Everything about the film--the acting, the editing, the camera work, and the haunting musical score contribute to its' being a rare and uplifting experience.

078681859X|4.0|This was one of the more creative and funny books I've read.  Mr. Stroud had the ability to make me sympathatic toward Bartimaeus, who i guess comes across slightly* evil. he's a very funny evil person/djinn/demon/genie/shape shifting thing. So i guess that makes up for it. Right? Right? <br /> <br />But unfortunatly, i found Nathanial a brat. I have a tendancy to hate people who do things for honor. Which is basically what most characters do things for, or destiny which is worse. Uck.  <br /> <br />Happily though, he turns into a rather pompous idiot in the second book. Which is different then an honorable idiot. No honor involved, just rising up the veritable food chain of a magicians career. What ever that may be. Cheers to adolensence and selfcenteredism.   <br /> <br />Sadly, many parts of this book is expectable and it never does explain what makes Nathanial this all powerful summoning person. I like explainations and rational things, which is wierd*, considering the books i read. <br /> <br />*Under statement <br /> <br />'Goodbye my friends you've reached the end.'  <br />-Quote from I Spy treasure hunt book <br /> <br />
0790732203|4.0|I remember seeing this movie when it first came to the theaters on Labor Day weekend '83. Saw the flick with two of my elderly aunts. I mean, how tacky is that? Loved seeing / watching this sex comedy again and again. Straight A student Joel (Tom Cruise) tries to avoid his annoying friend's advise on how to 'get lucky' with a hot girl from the newspaper's personal ads. But Miles (Curtis Armstrong - we know him as Booger from 'Revenge Of The Nerds') won't easily give up until he gets Joel a woman. Several twists and situations occur before Joel meets his dream girl, Lana (Rebecca De Mornay) and gets his first lay (memorable scene, by the way). Joel, Miles and Lana later end up in a car chase scene being pursued by Guido, the killer pimp (Joe Pantoliano) who turns out to be Lana's pimp. Just watch the movie, you'll be glad you did. If you can believe it, I still run into people who've NEVER even scene this or several other 'Blockbuster' movies.

B0006L16N8|5.0|\\"X&Y\\" is good. But the more you keep playing it, it just keeps getting better. It's really baffling to me that some are struggling to admit that this is a great album and insist on giving backhanded 3-star compliments. It's so far from the truth. I've never seen so many people in denial all at once. If everyone was as capable of recording the way Coldplay does, the music industry wouldn't being in the horrid condition that it is. At least Coldplay attempted to do something different with their music. The arrangements are absolutely stunning. Your money will be will spent purchasing \\"X&Y\\"
B0007Y08IS|4.0|If you're tired of the seemingly endless parade of tired genre films, adaptations, and remakes coming out of Hollywood these days, Team America: World Police may be just what you need to shake you out of your bad movie-induced slumber.  Coming from Trey Parker and Matt Stone, the twisted minds behind the enduring classic that is South Park, Team America is a bloody, profanity-laced, sexually perverted comic romp of a movie, the kind sure to offend prudes and morality police everywhere.  Not to mention, all the filth, violence, and depravity that this movie contains (and there's plenty of it) occurs against the backdrop of the grandiosely titled War on Terror, as we witness the enduring struggle between America and its enemies played out on the world stage.  Yes, Trey and Matt have devoted an entire movie to delivering their own skewed take on the battle that has captivated Americans for almost four years now.  And they've done it all with a cast consisting entirely of marionettes.<br /><br />Arrayed on one side is Team America, standing alone to police the world and defend freedom from the fanatical terrorists who seek to bring down civilization.  Their skills are unparalleled, and they're aided by a vast array of special \\"valmorphanizing\\" weapons and vehicles.  Consisting of a former All-American quarterback, an empath, a psychologist, and of course the finest martial artist Detroit has to offer, Team America is an elite group made virtually unstoppable by the guidance of their no-nonsense supervisor Mr. Spotswood and the omniscient supercomputer I.N.T.E.L.L.I.G.E.N.C.E..  They travel the world seeking out their enemies wherever they may hide, and causing lots of nifty explosions in the process.  Sure, the French and the Egyptians may not appreciate Team America's efforts too much when they blow up the The Louvre and the Eiffel Tower in the former country and the Sphinx and the Great Pyramid in the latter, but hey, somebody's got to take responsibility for keeping the free world safe.<br /><br />After a member's death in the movie's opening sequence, Team America is forced to look outside the group for help, and Spotswood manages to find them the perfect weapon: Gary Johnston, a \\"maverick renegade\\" of a Hollywood actor with a degree in theater and world languages that will enable him to infiltrate the deepest corners of the terrorist underworld.  Gary is such a convincing actor that his made-up tale of suffering at the hands of the American infidels brings tears to the eyes of even the most hardened terrorists.  And while he initially doesn't want the guilt, shame, and responsibility that come with his position, by the end he's undergone such a transformation that he's willing to service his boss in the name of freedom.<br /><br />On the other, darker side of the equation is Kim Jong-Il, the diminutive Korean dictator plotting a terrorist strike that will be equal to 911 times 2,356 (do the math).  Parker and Stone really did their homework when it came to portraying Kim (they confess to being fascinated by him in the DVD's special features), and what comes out is sort of a combination of Eric Cartman, Josef Stalin, and a bulk-rate James Bond Villain, with the accent of the Chinese restaurant owner from South Park.  Kim cuts a menacing figure, and clearly has no qualms about cold-blooded murder, but as we learn in one of the greatest songs in movie history, he's really just \\"ronery\\" (i.e., lonely) and smarting from a lack of respect.  In other words, he's the kind of movie villain you love to hate, only a lot funnier than most.<br /><br />Perhaps even more ominously, though, Kim has enlisted the aid of \\"secret weapon\\" Alec Baldwin and his parnters in the Film Actors Guild (in case you can't figure out the acronym, it's prominently mentioned and displayed on numerous occasions).  Led by Baldwin, the Guild is composed of the kind of people who truly understand global politics, namely famous movie actors who can read newspapersand then repeat what they've read as though it's their own opinion.  World-class whiner and useless troll Michael Moore even makes an appearance as a hot dog-waving, mumbling domestic terrorist.  Unfortunately, Kim's devious mind formulates a fiendish plan to use the Guild to further his plans to throw the world into chaos, and only Team America can stop him.  But first, Gary & Co. have to overcome the dark secrets, resentments, and hidden and unrequited loves that threaten to tear them apart.<br /><br />So, what works in Team America?  Fortunately, just about everything.  South Park long ago revealed Parker and Stone as insightful social critics as well as top-notch filth merchants, and Team America ultimately proves to be a fast-paced and consistently hilarious examination of world politics when it's not brilliantly spoofing the action-movie genre.  South Park has seen Parker and Stone generally leaning to the right of center of the American political spectrum, but they've also show a willingness to take the piss out of anyone's deeply held beliefs, and this movie is no exception.  Those on the left, those on the right, and those who just plain hate politics should find a lot to laugh at here.<br /><br />Early on there's plenty of mockery of American ignorance and arrogance: Gary's \\"transformation\\" into an Arab terrorist consists of little more than sticking some dark hair plugs on his face; the Panana Canal is described as \\"2,193 miles south of the real America\\"; team members gleefully blow up priceless buildings and monuments and expect the natives to be grateful.  There are also some transcendently stupid parodies of the trite jingoistic anthems that sprung up in droves after the September 11 attacks (\\"Freedom Costs a Buck-Oh-Five\\"; \\"America, F*** Yeah.\\").  About halfway through, though, the movie shifts gears and launches into a sustained assault on the \\"elites\\" of Hollywood and the U.N..  Of course, since Stone was once quoted as saying \\"I hate conservatives, but I really f***ing hate liberals,\\" this should come as no surprise.  In one rather telling moment, famed weapons inspector Hans Blix exemplifies the impotence of international governing bodies when he tells Kim that refusal to disclose North Korea's weapons program will result in an angry letter from the U.N..  And of course, there are countless sendups of the ignorance of Hollywood liberals, with Tim Robbins babbling incoherently about corporations and Matt Damon saying nothing more than his own name.<br /><br />Now, none of the above would matter if Team America weren't an uproariously funny comedy, but it succeeds wildly on that score as well.  The political humor often takes center stage, but there's still more than enough of the explicit banter and graphic imagery that fans of Parker and Stone have come to expect.  The sex scene between two marionettes has gained much of the attention that this movie generated, and rightfully so: at about two minutes in length, performed to the tune of an appropriately wretched power ballad and filled with positions that are just plain wrong, it's more than worth getting the uncensored edition for.  If you're weak of stomach you may want to take a bathroom break during the extended vomiting scene, though.<br /><br />An any rate, by the time Team America ends with a brutally funny and surprisingly accurate summation of America's role in the world that's far too explicit for me to repeat in this space, it's clear that we have a comedy classic on our hands.  In an age of rampant political correctness and the looming threat of censorship from the sorry likes of the Parents Television Council and similar busybodies, it's good to see someone (or someones) pushing the limits of good taste and creating something intelligent and truly funny in the process.  Increasingly sanitized and enstupidated fare may be the norm coming out of Hollywood now, but in such a climate films like this one only stand out even more.

0765309408|5.0|Combine classic Heinlein with some Joe Haldeman and Larry Niven, and you might get something like \\"Old Man's War\\". Coming from me, that's high praise indeed, since those are three of my favorites.<br /><br />It's been a long time since I started an SF book and couldn't put it down. But I read through this book in an evening, unwilling to go to sleep without getting through it.<br /><br />Combining challenging ideas, good character development, and clear, coherent prose style seems to be impossible for most current SF authors. So it was a big surprise to see all three of those in a first novel. This novel flows easily, without the awkwardness or irrelevent fluff of, say, Greg Bear. The ideas are interesting and sometimes surprising, without being weird and hard to imagine as in far too many contemporary SF novels.<br /><br />The hook at the beginning is that only someone who's 75 can go into the armed forces. Since the main character, as well as the others he meets early, are all aged and have various degrees of infirmity, it's obvious that they will have to be restored or augmented in some way before they can fight. But the armed forces don't tell these folks how that's done, so the book begins with the mystery of how 75 year olds can become part of an effective fighting force. That mystery is cleverly solved (with a solution that reminded me of something Niven might produce), and then the action begins.<br /><br />The fighting is violent and harsh, much like you would see from someone like Haldeman, but not gratuitously so. The novel is much more about the implications of the way the oldsters are \\"augmented\\" for the armed forces.<br /><br />I have to agree with a couple of other reviewers that the ending was sudden and a bit pat, but I have to say it was not the way I expected it to end two-thirds of the way through.<br /><br />This book is obvious Hugo/Nebula material, especially compared to much of the dreck currently produced. I don't think it ranks with the all-time best (novels like Mote in God's Eye, Ender's Game, or even Starship Troopers), but it's very, very good. If you are yearning for a refreshing dose of more classically styled SF, this one is definitely for you.anks with the all-time best (novels like Mote in God's Eye, Ender's Game, or even Starship Troopers), but it's very, very good.

B00004WCPY|5.0|I feel fortunate to have an older sister.Thanks to her taste in music,I was introduced to everything from Queen and Led Zeppelin to A Flock Of Seagulls and Gary Numan.Welcome To The Pleasuredome was one of those albums that twisted my young mind,shaping and forging my lasting musical tastes.There's a deep hidden prog feel to this album owing more to Rush than Yazoo and Depeche Mode.The  message to this album is one of pure hedonism with no pretentions or posturing,something today's pop stars could take note of.Anyone of any age can appreciate the catchy and varied layering of guitar,keyboard and bass,though the lyrical content is decidedly geared more towards those of an older and more sophisticated audience.Some of the standout tracks are the  pleasurable Snatch Of Fury,Two Tribes and the tremendously popular Relax,played in strip clubs nightly the world over.As much as I enjoyed those tracks(and believe me I did),I feel the crown of this album was Frankie's cover of Bruce Springsteen's Born To Run.Its a rare thing  to outdo or match someone when covering one of their own songs,but somehow Frankie pulls off this rare feat with wild abandon and true skill showin.Groups like Frankie Goes To Hollywood always burn out before they should,but its tough to top an album like Welcome To The Pleasuredome,very tough.For fans of techno or 80's pop,there's worse things you could spend your money on than by buying a new copy of Pleasuredome.I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.
B0006L16N8|5.0|After a 3 year absence, Coldplay has come back stronger than ever. I would have never expected them to top AROBTTH, didn't think it was possible. But they found a way. I'm a fan for life now. I can't wait to hear album #4. But I'll enjoy their new release while I'm patiently waiting. So I recommend that everyone go out and support Coldplay and buy their CD.
B000069AUI|5.0|People were expecting Coldplay to \\"reinvent the wheel\\" with X&Y, and that wasn't an unreasonable expectation with the amount of time they spent in the studio and the fact that they said they would reinvent the wheel.  It appears, however, that reinventing the wheel meant discovering the guitar, and with the disappointment of X&Y, I have come to appreciate this album more, knowing that Coldplay may very well never top the sophomore effort. <br /> <br />The moody guitars in 'Politik' are just perfect to begin the album.  The sound is perfect. <br /> <br />'In My Place' has a strong beat and a good guitar phrase as the melody.  It's perfect as a slowdance number. <br /> <br />'God Put a Smile Upon Your Face' is the dark number that is sorely lacking in the middle of X&Y ('Twisted Logic' is alright, but 'Low' doesn't really do the job).  It's a good one. <br /> <br />'The Scientist' is a great song, and much better than 'Fix You' in my opinion. <br /> <br />The piano riff in 'Clocks' is much better crafted than that in 'Speed of Sound.'  I think it's much more catchy, and it will probably always be a top-25 song in my playlist. <br /> <br />'Daylight' is weak; it's probably a bit too long. <br /> <br />'Green Eyes' is a very sparse, acoustic ballad.  This is just the kind of thing the album needed after the production in the previous two songs.  I don't listen to it as much as the others, but this kind of song largely disappears from the canon after Parachutes. <br /> <br />'Warning Sign' is another of my favorites.  It's a good slowdance tune, and the guitar is catchy with the cello underneath it. <br /> <br />I can't stand 'A Whisper.'  The dark bombasity from that song is pretty much missing in X&Y, however.  It's probably the guitars that get to me, I suppose; I don't like them particuarly. <br /> <br />'A Rush of Blood to the Head' is quite a solid tune.  It does what 'A Whisper' tried to do, but much more effectively - it gets you in a solemn mood. <br /> <br />'Amsterdam' fluctuates on me; sometimes I think it's really good, other times it sounds blah.  I guess it's not too bad an ending to the album; I do like the lyrics about \\"you cut me loose.\\" <br /> <br />X&Y, I believe, lacks some of the musical elements that made A Rush of Blood to the Head so successful.  AROBTTH will always be one of my favorite albums, even despite the couple of weak tracks. <br /> <br />If I had to make a CD of my favorite Coldplay songs, it would include 'Don't Panic,' 'Sparks,' 'Parachutes,' 'Yellow,' 'We Never Change,' 'The Scientist,' 'Clocks,' 'A Rush of Blood to the Head,' 'Warning Sign,' 'What If,' 'White Shadows,' 'Speed of Sound,' 'Talk,' and 'Swallowed in the Sea.'
B0006L16N8|4.0|I am writing this as a big fan of Coldplay. They're my favorite band ever. Compared to Parachutes and A Rush of Blood to the Head, this album is not as vibrant. The songs don't even compare to \\"Don't Panic,\\" \\"Shiver,\\" \\"Politic,\\" or any of the songs on Rush of Blood. Still, this album is worth a listen.  <br /> <br />The band has an older sound on this album, probably because Chris Martin feels older after his baby was born. This album is geared more to 25-30 year olds rather than 18-25 year olds like the previous albums.  <br /> <br />I noticed a change in the lyrics. They're not as generic as on the past albums, but who listens to Coldplay for the lyrics anyways? Most people like me listen to it for the emotional quality. It's still bittersweetly romantic. Coldplay songs seem to transport you into another place. I think of being on the beach at sunrise.  <br /> <br />A lot of the faster songs remind me of Echo and the Bunnymen. Coldplay emulated their sound on purpose. I miss the original Coldplay.  <br /> <br />Highlights on X&Y are Square 1, Speed of Sound, a Message, and Twisted Logic.
B0006L16N8|5.0|There are only a few CD's that I listen to for the first time and fall in love right away.  This is one of those CD's.  Every single song is a hit.  They did it again!
B00005OMTT|5.0|Sensuality, seductive, mysterious, enchanting this words are the best you can use to describe enigma music every sing is unique on his own way you can be on a sensuality mood with songs like Almost Full Moon, callas went away, and traces light and weight, and paper cups like you can go back in time to the medieval times as in his fist cd McMxc A.D as you can immerse in a hypnotic trip on a sea of tranquility like i said before every song is unique on its own way and every song can interpret as much you want. <br /> <br />in simple words enima's music is real pure mood music that can be situated for almost every thing from hard trance to complete tranquility
B0006L16N8|4.0|I love the new direction that Coldplay is going in with this album.  I think they really have stuck to their roots as musicians, but it really allows the listeners to see where they have come since Parachutes.  The hype of this album was not a let down in this case.  I was worried because of all the publicity they were doing for this record. <br /> <br />\\"Low\\" is a really great kind of new song for Coldplay the tempo of the song is fast from the beginning there isn't really any lead up to the song speeding up.  This song is really powerful and brings a new element to the album. <br /> <br />The hidden track was a really good choice because it was originally written by Johnny Cash song that he didn't have a chance to record so Coldplay decided to record it.  This song is a really great closing for the album.  It gives us a chance to see their versatility as musicians. <br /> <br />Overall this is a great album and a must buy! I loved it from the second I put it on. <br />
B000001Y16|5.0|This record signified the end of an era.  Released just a couple of months after Tupac was violently murdered in a drive by shooting no one could wait to get there hands on this disc.  It could have been terrible and we would have still loved it.  Fortunately it was quite the opposite.  With less than half as many songs as ALL EYES ON ME this CD is a great farewell to one of the greatest rappers of all time and great minds in recent history.  Nobody could deliver hits with the consistancy and speed of Tupac.  Even when faced with a mediocre beat(which usually wasn't the case)he could turn a song into a classic.  In a weeks time he went into the studio and recorded this classic album with classic songs like \\"Hail Mary\\", \\"Toss It Up\\", \\"To Live And Die In L.A.\\", \\"Krazy\\", \\"Against All Odds\\" and pretty much every other song here.  Topics range from serenading L.A. to the stress of living in the south central part of it.  This is the first album, signified by \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" released as a B-side earlier the same year, that Tupac takes off the gloves and unleashes on all of his enemies from usual East Coast targets Nas, Jay-Z and Mobb Deep to former collaborator Dr. Dre.  Adding to the controversy surrounding THE DON KILLUMINATI: THE 7 DAY THEORY was Tupac assuming the psuedonym Makaveli after a man who faked his own death.  This combined with strong hope and memories of Pac surviving 5 shots in an assasination attempt less than two years earlier was enough to get even the most rational minds spinning.  But the truth is harsh, and this is the last classic from a legend.      Tupac died, Suge Knight went to prison for violating his probation by being involved in a fight alongside Tupac the same night he was killed and with Suge's former partner Dr. Dre departed from Death Row this was the end of a dynasty.  With the murder of Pac's archrival Notorious B.I.G. just 6 months later the entire genre of gangsta rap for the most part was put on the back burner for other pop and hardcore but not necessarily \\"gangsta\\" MC's like Puff Daddy, Mase, Nas, Jay-Z, DMX and Eminem.  And when gangsta rap was all but dead for better or worse, enter 50 Cent.
B0002S94OS|5.0|this is one hell of a cd! its amazing i highly suggest it to any fan of metal or hard rock you will be blown away! i guess the reason i like lamb of god so much is because they remind me of this local band:dookin(which are incredable) but seriously its an amazing cd all the songs are awesome my favorites are laid to rest & now youve got something to die for! GO BUY THIS CD NOW!!!!
B00005K3OT|5.0|This movie is very pleasant to watch, but there is no getting around the message it sends that church is not important and that it is for stuck up people who don't know how to have fun. <br /> <br />As much as I dis-agree with this concept one must admit that this film was well acted, well done, and beautifuly filmed. <br /> <br />It is what it is. <br /> <br />Delicious? <br />Yes. <br /> <br />Against Christianity? <br />Mostly. <br /> <br />However, I completely agree with the sermon of the preachers pupil near the end of the film when he brings up the humanity of Christ because without that side of Christ he coulnd't have saved us at all. <br /> <br />So the film has alot of good things to say as well but it preaches a waterd down Christianity that does not condemn fornication or indulgence.
B00030590I|3.0|Another artsy martial arts movie with matrix style special effects(been there seen that)and 10 minutes sword fights..<br /><br />what was the point of that fight between Moon and Flying Snow?<br /><br />(it looked cool)..and how many differant ways can Broken Sword die? And that gay fight on the lake..what was that?..YIKES
B00005AQE8|5.0|ALL EYES ON ME is one of the extremely rare double disc albums complete with 27 songs that you can listen to straight through over and over again with only \\"What'z Ya Phone No.\\" being what I consider a \\"filler\\" song.  (Obviously that's not technically the case since they had more than enough songs).  ALL EYES ON ME and Notorious B.I.G.'s East Coast counterpart LIFE AFTER DEATH are the perfect examples of how great Pac and Biggie both were releasing 2 disc albums packed full of classics, a feat both Jay-Z and Nas have failed at.  2Pac had been through numerous trials, shot 5 times and spent 9 months in prison prior to the creation of this masterpiece and after Suge Knight paid for his release and signed him to Death Row 2Pac rightfully seemed to be celebrating just being alive throughout the album with songs like \\"California Love\\" feat. Dr. Dre, \\"Picture Me Rolling\\", \\"\\"All Eyes On Me\\", Thug Passion\\", \\"How Do You Want It\\" feat. Jodeci, \\"I'd Rather Be Your N.I.G.G.A.\\" and \\"2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted\\" feat. Snoop Doggy Dogg(ain't nothin' but a gangsta party) and I could go on.  These songs in some degree are a stark contrast to the introspective bluesiness of ME AGAINST THE WORLD, but Pac still hasn't lost his insight inside life that applies to such a much more diverse audience than just those living Thug Life.  While nothing on this album is as heartfelt as \\"Dear Mama\\", \\"Keep Ya Head Up\\" or \\"Brenda's Got A Baby\\" songs like \\"Life Goes On\\", \\"Wonder Why They Call U B****\\" and \\"Shorty Wanna Be A Thug\\" show obstacles in his life have not made him too bitter to still care.  Even with all of this Pac finds plenty of time for cocky, boastful songs like \\"Ain't Hard 2 Find\\" and \\"No More Pain\\" a haunting track produced by Devante of Jodeci.  The battle classic \\"Hit 'Em Up\\" dissing Notorious B.I.G. and pretty much every rapper on the East Coast that was released as a B-side of the \\"California Love\\" single is absent from this CD as is the A-side of the aforementioned single.  Onlythe remix of \\"California Love\\" is on this LP.  Dr. Dre only produces a couple of songs which seemed strange at the time with an artist of 2Pac's stature signing to Death Row, but of course now we know Dre was already planning his release from Death Row at the time.  Suprisingly I do not believe this album could be any better if Dr. Dre produced the entire thing.  Excellent CD.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Unbelievable.  Since I first heard Coldplay on an Alias TV Show episode, I was hooked.  Ever song on this album is great.   The Hardest Part and Square One are my two favorites.  You will not be disappointed with this album!
B000002H70|5.0|Let me start with this, I own all the albums by the Cure, but this one is one of my most favorites. I recently re-discovered this CD when deciding to load it onto my iPod. I was quickly reminded how freakin brilliant and wonderful this whole album is. Its chalked full of beautiful melodies accompanied by Robert Smith's brooding, melancholy voice.  <br /> <br />My favorite tracks on this album are \\"Love Song\\", \\"Lullabye\\", \\"Pictures of You\\", \\"Last Dance\\", forget it, I love the whole album. I can't really list fairly my faves, because I love them all. This is one of those rare albums that every song is awesome and unforgettable. \\"Disinigration\\" truly stands out as one of the Cure's most stellar albums. It blends their famous gothic, moody look and sound with synth-pop to form a remarkable marriage. The whole thing just works great together. I understand why so many current bands have drawn so much influence from the Cure. They were truly pioneers in their day and this album still does not sound dated. That is one thing I love about \\"Disinigration\\". It sounds as if it could have come out today amongst some of these other bands. I believe this album is worth a listen to truly appreciate.
B000000WGL|4.0|I waited years for Keith to release a solo album, and I had no idea this is what would be produced, more or less. I figured there would be some country, perhaps some ballads on piano (remember the El Mocambo sessions), and a few not-so-well known Chuck Berry or Eddie Cochran rockers. Nope, not here.  In any case, its a good CD and you should buy it if you like Keith.  Also, check out the opening riff of Take It So Hard and listen to the rattling of the snare drum. That's unpretentious and that's cool!
B000003TAR|5.0|In musical sense this is a much better album than Nevermind, Nevermind was an album more about the songs, this album is more about the music and guitar noise. <br />In other words absolutely fantastically brilliant - wheyhey!
B0009A1AS2|5.0|This album is just wow... I just can't stop playing it back! It's a beautiful mix of heavy music and mellower rythm.... I am a big fan of Dream Theater, but was never in love with James voice.. He really surprised me on Octavarium! For all DT fan and Prog Rock fan too! This album is a 2005 Must!
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|I Am a fan of a lot of the artists on Live Aid When I asked My Parents What Live Aid Was When I was 14 The Claimed not to know I said what biggest concert of 1985 (I Was Three Days Off being Three Months Old When It Aired)and you don't remember it with this DVD Release i now know why JULY 13th 1985 was also The day my parents were Married Now For Some Highlights  <br /> <br />Queen <br />Elton John  <br />Paul McCartney  <br />Neil Young  <br />David Bowie  <br />George Thorogood & The Destroyers  <br />Joan Baez  <br />The Who  <br />Crosby Stills & Nash  <br /> <br />These Are The Highlights Of This DVD Set
B00008DYSI|5.0|If you are searching for a metal band who will make you feel uplifted and full of an undescribable \\"epic joy\\" then I can recommend two bands (as well as many others, but they are slightly less amazing): <br /> <br />Rhapsody ([...]) <br />and ... Dragonforce! <br /> <br />Dragonforce's \\"Valley of the Damned\\" will have those of you who love \\"Lord of the Rings\\" (JRR Tolkien) as well as fast, powerful, epic metal, in a trance.   <br /> <br />You will listen to this album and sometime next year you will finally turn it off.  It's just that good. <br /> <br />So anyone searching for a real piece of EPICNESS should be shot if they didn't check out Dragonforce's \\"Valley of the Damned\\", as well as Rhapsody (notably their album \\"Tales from the Emerald Sword Saga\\"). <br /> <br />Dragonforce's other album \\"Sonic Firestorm\\" keeps with the epic sound, but incorporates much more speed and technical ability, so if you enjoy speed metal, go for that instead. <br /> <br />Or... GET BOTH!  And fly, you fools!
B0006L16N8|5.0|When I first listened to Speed of Sound, during the live broadcast on Radio One, the first thought that indolently rummaged its way through my extensively under-worked mind was: nah, lazy permutational rip-off of old songs - good overall, but nothing exceptional and, what's worse, nothing original.  <br /> <br />When I first listened to the album, my initial comments were even less encouraging. The only attributes I could come up with were: boring, nonintersecting, uncharismatic, unpersuasive, waste of two years/boatloads of EMI money/Martin's voice. In a careless, though blessed, exercise of magnanimity towards those fat-cats at the helm of multinational music conglomerates and the equally fat (though less ostentatiously so) artists they champion, I decided to download the damn thing anyway.  <br /> <br />Well, after a few, rather more attentive, listening sessions, I finally saw the light. I finally managed to extrapolate a dose of what had been poisoning Coldplay for two years. I finally saw the merits of the album. True, the lyrics are preposterous. I seriously, though respectfully, fail to see the point pursued by the reviewer below in jotting down extracts of mindless, incongruent, vomit-inducingly naive crap. But, what the hell, it's rock music not Keats, so, quite frankly, the songs may as well mean nothing at all, I wouldn't give a s**t as long as they sound good. And, boy, do these sound good. It only takes a few re-plays and, similarly to earlier Coldplay efforts, the listener is well and truly hooked. One could argue that the vast majority of the attempts in X&Y pale by comparison to some of their best work in Parachutes or a Rush of Blood to the Head. And, in all probability, one would be right. However, it is equally indubitable that this remains music of the highest calibre. Music that moves you - not the unabashedly silly words, of course, but the music itself. Music that, paired with the appropriate circumstantial surroundings, can give you shivers.Music that, to the annoyance of the poor sod who has the misfortune of accompanying you, you embarrassingly hum whilst walking on the street.  <br /> <br />All tracks are pretty good. The ones that, in my (not) very humble opinion, are particularly worthy of mention are: X&Y, Fix You (apart from the excruciating introductory line: \\"when you try your best but you don't succeed\\" -  ahhh, awful!), Swallowed By The Sea and The Hardest Part. Though, like I said, the whole album is very good.  <br />
B0006L16N8|5.0|Anyone who loves great music should love X&Y. There's no way you can be a true lover of music and not appreciate what Coldplay did with this record. How can someone even say that this record is a \\"step backwards?\\" That's ridiculous. Coldplay just set the standard for 2005. This album is AMAZING!!!
0064407667|4.0|Lemony Snicket's first Series of Unfortunate Events is surely a good one. It follows the miserable tales of the Baudelaire children. It involves a sneaky and mean villian named Count Olaf and his troupe including a hook-handed man. It starts off on the beach when the children hear some bad news and have to live with a person named Count Olaf. The death of their parents is sad for the Baudelaires. Their parents perished in a fire in their humungous mansion, the Baudelaires mansion. Each are good at something. Violet Baudelaire, the oldest, is good at inventing miraculous stuff. Klaus Baudelaire, the middle one, loves reading, and knows alot. Sunny Baudelaire, the youngest and an infant, loves biting stuff. <br /> <br />Olaf is a bad man. Soon he wants to put his filthy hands on the enormous Baudelaire fortune. He soon thinks of a plan. Will the Baudelaires ruin his plan and escape? Will they tell Mr. Poe in time and will he believe them? Or will Violet and Klaus save Sunny's life and make a plan of their own to stop Olaf from touching their fortune? <br /> <br />I recommend you buy this book and the other twelve to go through the entire Baudelaire journey.
0786715103|5.0|Its quite hard to say 'good' things about this book just because the subject matter is so horrific. How a rag tag band of gangsters and terrorists carried out the massacre of 800,000 people in a 100 days is impossible to comprehend. Its even more incredible that the international community did nothing to stop this killing. it just goes to prove that governments be they dictatorial or democratic are self-interested entities that care little for the sufferings of peoples who have no strategic or economic vaule for them.  Its tragic but as Dallaire himself says we must fully understand what happened in order for it not to happen again. Dallaire was on the ground for much of the genocide and did what he could with the meager resources he had so save as many lives as he could but he could only do so much. Dallaire himself and independent military analysts have confirmed that the genocide may well have been stopped had 5500 UN troops who were properly equippted been deployed on the ground. But the west is  rich and greedy africa is poor and with little hope...we in the west think thats just how things are and thats how they will always be and maybe that is the sad fact of life but people such educate themselves and see the world as a whole as a place in need and full of suffering, once enough people have become aware they can mobilize and take action to press there governments into doing the right thing. God bless you General Dallaire.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This album is amazing. It rocks all kindsa hard.  vocals guitar drums bass all dead on.  if you like heavy rock and metal you should buy this. nuff said
B0006L16N8|4.0|Funny how people always want to revert to older records as being \\"better than the new stuff\\". This is Coldplay's best record yet. They get better with each recording, but I'm still waiting for the five star record.
B0007GAEW6|3.0|I discovered TMV's De-Loused in December and loved every minute of it.  I was playing it all the time and I couldn't wait to get the new CD.  When I listened to Frances the first time though, it seemed to fall flat.  I tried to give it several listenings, but the CD never really grew on me.  It's great that the band did not try to repeat itself, but here are a few bad changes they made: <br /> <br />First, the wierd loops are not my favorite aspect of the band, but on De-loused they were concise and served the purpose of bridging the tracks well.  On Frances, they are unbearably long and far less interesting.  I am forced to skip them, which defeats the purpose of having them there.  Also, this album is much more classic-rock oriented than the previous one.  It's not necessarily a bad thing, but the guitar solos (with the exception of the first track) are very bland and often crowd the vocals.  Omar just shreds through the same damn scales that were played to death in the 70's, gratuitously drowning out Cedric's interesting vocal line.  My one other quip with the album is that sometimes just a little restraint is a good thing, and restraint is nowhere to be found here.  Aside from terrifyingly dull noise loops, the third track becomes literally annoying when it goes back to the slow piano part for a third time and stays there . . . forever.  Also, the last song is good in parts but has the feel of Dazed and Confused live (which Zeppelin would play for 20 - 30 minutes).  In other words, there are just too many different things strung together arbitrarily. <br /> <br />The album does have its shining moments.  The first track is very good, and coincidentally it sounds the most like the De-loused material.  My other favorite is the fourth track, after the first five minutes of filler.  It is a very somber piece which pours out a feeling of despair.  Overall, I was disappointed with this CD, because I think TMV can do better.  I hope they get their feet a little more firmly on the ground and make some more great music.
B0006L16N8|4.0|One very late night in 2000, I was watching MTV2 half asleep and saw a video for a song I had never heard of by a band that was also unfamiliar to me.  The video was dark and gloomy, yet it immediately caught my attention.  The video was for a song called \\"Yellow\\", and the band was Coldplay.  The next day I immediately sought out their album, and after making a couple unsuccessful stops, I finally got my hands on PARACHUTES.  I have been hooked ever since.      After thoroughly enjoying the album, its follow up A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD even more so, and attending their 2003 concert tour, I waited with great anticipation for X & Y.  I purchased the first single for the album, \\"Speed of Sound\\", as an import, and couldn't wait to hear the b-sides, since Coldplay's b-sides are often as good as what made it to the album.  Initially I was disappointed---\\"Proof\\" was only ok, and while I liked \\"Things I Don't Understand\\" a lot, it seemed to be missing something.  However, after repeated listenings, things turned around, and I remembered something that always occurs with this band and me: it sometimes takes a while to warm up to some of Coldplay's output.    X & Y is no different.  On first listen, I was bored, perplexed, and perhaps a little disappointed.  The overwhelming size and sound of the tracks almost overwhelm you as you get lost in the atmospheric and spacey surroundings of each song.  Then I remembered my old adage: some of Coldplay's songs take a commitment from the listener to appreciate fully, and with subsequent spins, the old adage came true.  My verdict after taking a week to listen to it: X & Y is an excellent record.      Musically, Coldplay remain true to their original style while taking a step forward.  I appreciate the heavy atmospheric sound this album produces---the band has obviously been influenced by the recent revival of `80s production techniques (found in \\"Talk\\", \\"White Shadows\\" and \\"X & Y\\") while remaining true to their sound and progressing forward at the same time (\\"Speed of Sound\\", \\"A Message\\", \\"Fix You\\" and \\"Square One\\").  The signature ballads are here as well, and \\"What If\\" is most certainly this album's \\"Trouble\\" or \\"The Scientist\\".  Then there are the incredibly fresh and exciting experimental tracks (\\"Twisted Logic\\", which has a Beatles ABBEY ROAD feel to it, and \\"Low\\", which would make old school R.E.M. fans proud).   The album closes with the 'hidden' track, \\"Til Kingdom Come\\", which I imagine either Johnny Cash doing in his basement late at night with close friends or Paul McCartney singing it in front of a stadium full of people all holding lighters in the air---it's quaint yet universal in message at the same time.    The album's clunker?  It's \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\", which seems forced and out of place.  The b-side \\"Things I Don't Understand\\" would have fit perfectly here, or maybe even \\"How You See the World\\", the bonus track on the Japanese release of \\"X & Y\\".  Either way, both songs deserve the effort to hunt them down.    Coldplay's X & Y remains my musical highlight of the last year, after being thoroughly disappointed by the lackluster \\"How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb\\" (U2).  Coldplay still has a lot to accomplish to gain the title of \\"biggest band in the world\\", which for all intents and purposes is still held by U2.  A reinvention of sorts is in order for Coldplay's next album, perhaps tackling different issues in their songwriting besides the old standbys of `love gone bad' and `love lost'.  But three solid albums in a row is nothing to overlook, either.      Highly recommended.      Major highlights: \\"White Shadows\\", \\"Talk\\", \\"Fix You\\" and \\"What If\\"    Also recommended: ASTRONAUT, Duran Duran (2004)
B0009A1AS2|2.0|I already gave this record 4 stars before- but after reading this GREAT review- I felt it had to be seen AGAIN. ITS PERFECT. NICE REVIEW DAVID <br />First. The Review. After that, the scam revealed.  <br /> <br />I have given Octavarium 4 full listens. It's hard to explain this album. It's not awful, it's not great, it's not \\"Six Degrees of Inner Slop.\\" It just `is'. I can't put my finger on it. It's like a mix between Images and Words and Falling into Infinity but without the magic of the former and the `umph' of the latter. There is not a single jaw-dropping moment on the album - though I'm not sure that's a bad thing in general. In other words, not once did I get goosebumps from a part that just made me go \\"holy crap!!\\" Yet it's a fairly pleasant listen. There are some decent, catchy tunes on it. It's kind of like Floyd. Nothing in Floyd's catalog is jaw dropping and yet their albums are stellar (not that this album is stellar! Not even close.). But because there are none of these jaw dropping moments on Octavarium, which DT needs in order to remain interesting, I'm afraid this album will probably become a boring listen rather quickly and not revisit the CD player after a few more listens. The mix on the album is ok. It's good to not hear that Kevin Shirley garbage that has plagued them for the last 5 albums. But the drums are buried and the mix overall is a little muddy for my tastes. The guitars are WAY understated, though there is a great Journey sounding solo on one of the earlier tunes, and the keys have finally been brought forward again after being non-existent for 4 albums. Labrie sounds good as usual but again, nothing extraordinary. And Portnoy may finally NOT win the Modern Drummer reader's poll after winning 9 straight years because he doesn't flex a whole lot. Yes, there are certainly those `Portnoy moments', but generally he just plays for the song. Normally, that's great! But with DT, we've come to expect a certain level of virtuosity that is justnot on this album. With Train of Thought and other DT albums, I knew those albums would grow on me because there was so much to digest. And they did grow on me as I really love those prior albums (except for SDOIT). But after one listen of Octavarium, I didn't find myself saying, \\"Wow, so much to digest.\\" It was easily swallowed, digested, and passed through my bowels.  <br /> <br />...Now onto the scam...  <br /> <br />I am of the mind that DT is truly spreading themselves too thin with all the side projects and too many of their good ideas are being filtered through 15 different bands. If they would just stick with DT and put ALL their effort there, I think each new album would be a masterpiece. But why is that not happening? It's simple. Dream Theater purely exists now so the band can make money on the DT name (thanks to 'fans' like us who keep buying their records) and earn a living, while playing and writing the music they TRULY want to play and write with other musicians in other projects. It's really that simple. A DT album comes out, it sells a million copies worldwide, they make a decent chunk of change on sales, merchandise, tours, and clinics, and then they go and play with other guys because that's where their hearts lie now.  <br /> <br />Like it or not, this could very well be the last DT album (or maybe we'll see one more) because I think fans are starting to catch on to this shameless scam.  <br /> <br />Shame on you Dream Theater for bilking your fans. Shame on us for falling for it album after album.  <br />
B00008OWZC|5.0|I never understood why Led Zeppelin was called a heavy metal band, and \\"How The West Was Won\\" doesn't do anything to enlighten me.  I put this CD (well, any one of the three CDs) in the CD player, and I'm hearing rock n' roll. Blues. Folk. And more rock n' roll, but not heavy metal.    Eh, never mind. Just thought I'd muse about that a little bit.  See, I'm not much of a heavy-fan, but I do own a few Zeppelin albums, and fortunately I also picked up this one when it came out earlier this year. And I was pleasantly surprised.    The sound is nothing short of amazing. I have heard worse sounding live recordings from the 90s, and the music is superb. A bit more rough and straight-forward than the original studio recordings, and that actually suits the songs very well - \\"Black Dog\\" may be a blues, but it rocks like you won't belive.  The folkish, acoustic \\"Going To California\\" is beautiful, showing the breadth and depth of Zeppelin's musical abilities. \\"Bron-Yr-Aur-Stomp\\" is pure fun (it's pronounced something like \\"bron-aire\\", if I remember correctly. Isn't it?).  \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" and \\"Rock And Roll\\" are pure hard rock heaven. And even the 25-minute medley of \\"Dazed And Confused\\", \\"Walter's Walk\\" and \\"The Crunch\\" somehow manages to stave off boredom.    I would have liked to hear the epic \\"When The Levee Breaks\\", too, and Plant can no longer hit the highest notes (a fact which marrs \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" in particular), but those are minor complaints - almost all of what is here is top-notch.  \\"How The West Was Won\\" includes most of Zeppelin's best and best-known songs, and they shine in this live setting. This is 70s blues-rock at its very finest, and anyone with even a slight interest in Led Zeppelin should own this album. They will not be disappointed.
B00079HZUM|4.0|Richard Eyre's underrated 'Stage Beauty' never found its legs during its US release, hauling in a scandalously low $782,000 (!) according to Boxoffice Mojo.  That's a shame, because 'Beauty' is definitely worth a look-see, most notably for the tour de force acting job turned in by Billy Crudup.  I recently saw his Broadway turn in the 'The Pillowman' and this guy can flat-out act.  His Pillowman role feautured torrents of rushed monologues.  Here in 'Beauty,' he pulls deeply from his Shakespearean background and delivers like a natural-born 17th-Century Brit.<br /><br />The stand-out scene is one in which we literally watch the birth of naturalistic acting (\\"Brando-style acting\\" as Eyre refers to it in the \\"Making of...\\" DVD extra).  We see a realistically terrified Clare Danes warding off Crudup's on-stage assault while the audience sits paralyzed and transfixed, unable to discern between real-life and acting.  It's explosive stuff.<br /><br />There are other tabloid-ish reasons to watch: as a result of 'Beauty,' Crudup left seven-months pregnant girlfriend Mary-Louise Parker and hooked up with Danes.  Watch the sparks fly here.

0141301066|5.0|Matilda is the cute, intelligent story of a cute, intelligent girl mistreated by her parents and headmistress.  She self-educates, relieves the tension in her life by playing a few tricks on those who abuse the power they have over her, and forms a special friendship with her first form(/grade) teacher.  Interesting connections eventually allow her to play one big trick to right all the wrongs done against her.  Matilda is sweet, honest, brainy, and  down-to-earth, and this quick read has irresistible charm.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Soaring music, tense drama, beautiful sets--it's all there!  I didn't think that anything could top the experience of the stage production of \\"Phantom\\", but this movie does an amazingly good job of adapting the timeless story to the screen.  Emmy Rossum hits all the right notes (no pun intended) as the winsome heroine who is torn between her love of the Angel of Music and Raoul, and Gerard Butler is convincing as the tormented Phantom.  Patrick Wilson's role is not nearly as interesting as the other two in the triangle, but his vocals add a welcome dimension to the duets and trios.  Minnie Driver is a wonderful Prima Dona and the other supporting roles are played convincingly.  The movie captures the magic of the play, especially in the large production numbers and adds an extra dimension afforded by close-ups and adaptability of settings.  This movie is highly recommended!
B0007TX894|5.0|Truly a Masterpiece - There are no words I can describe for this - No matter what sytle of music you like I think you will appreciate this album... Very talented musicianship... and quite possibly the best rock band to emerge since the 70's.

Coldplay, luckily, does not feel the need to \\"experiment\\"  with their sound.  It's a great album from start to end,  fans will not be dissapointed.  Check out my personal favorite, 'Fix You'.
B00008AWOG|5.0|This is proabably my fav. opeth album... (know I'll have people saying Blackwater Park - which is also great - and even has steven wilson) But the music on this is amazing.  \\"The Moor\\" is quite possible the best metal song since \\"battery\\" (You know by that band who sucks now?) Actually Opeth has progressed in every release so far... (in fact in the last 4 months I got a hold of every release (Escept Orchid) and even though this is my personnel fav. I definitly see the progression on BWP and Deliverance (Damnation is a whole other story - a very well told story)  But back to Still Life - simply amazing, words cannot express what this album is trying to to say... only the music can speak - give it a listen - from all walks of metal you will enjoy this (assuming Papa Roach isn't your idea of Metal)      IF YOU LIKED, AGREED, OR APPRECIATED THIS PLEASE CLICK YES FOR:  \\"Was this review helpful?\\"
B0007Y08QA|3.0|\\"The Machinist\\" is a visually striking mystery/psychological thriller in the vein of 1999's \\"Fight Club\\", in which insomnia produces a psychosis in the protagonist. Trevor Reznick (Christian Bale) hasn't slept in a year. He works in a machine shop and drives all the way to the airport for coffee and pie, served by a striking waitress named Marie (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon), every night after work. Trevor's confidant and only friend is Stevie (Jennifer Jason Leigh), a prostitute whom he visits for conversation and sex. Trevor has become dangerously distracted by an unsettling new coworker named Ivan (John Sharian). But no one else believes that Ivan exists. Cryptic notes that Trevor doesn't remember writing keep turning up in his apartment. Is he going crazy? And why can't he sleep? Trevor's addled mind tries to cut through the haze of sleeplessness to figure out what it all means.<br /><br />\\"The Machinist\\" is essentially a dark detective story in which Trevor is investigating his own psyche, trying to make sense of what he has become with only an unsure grasp on reality to guide him. It's an interesting premise, and Trevor is an interesting character. Christian Bale's appearance is shocking. The normally well-built actor lost 63 pounds to transform himself into a pale, skeletal creature. His very appearance is disturbing. Let us hope he didn't do himself cardiac damage to achieve it. Bale's performance is tremendous. With the help of director Brad Anderson's dark visuals, Bale creates an intense impression of decay and uncertainty. At a few points, the audience may be ahead of Trevor in comprehending his situation, but we generally don't know what is real and what is not any more than Trevor does. In these things \\"The Machinist\\" succeeds. Unfortunately, the film feels a bit like insomnia itself. It is plodding, monotonous, and simply fails to engage. That might be a suitable tone for the material, but I doubt audiences will appreciate having to fend off sleep themselves. Christian Bale's performance is one of the most interesting of 2004, so have a look if you enjoy thespian virtuosity.<br /><br />The DVD (Paramount 2005 disc): Bonus features include a making-of documentary, an audio commentary, 8 deleted or alternate scenes -2 with commentary, and a theatrical trailer. \\"The Machinist: Breaking the Rules\\" (25 minutes) features interviews with director Brad Anderson, the cast, screenwriter Scott Kosar, and the film's Spanish producers, as well as some footage of filming in Barcelona, Spain. In the audio commentary, director Brad Anderson talks about his vision for the film, characters, story, locations, and his decisions. This commentary is reasonably informative and without many lulls.

B0002S947K|5.0|I took a chance on buying this CD since I haven't really heard much about Ray LaMontagne.  I really liked the entire album; every song is great.  This is easy listening stuff that I enjoy a lot.  Too bad not many people know about Ray LaMontagne; this CD is one of the best i've heard in a while.  Buy this CD, enjoy it, and spread the word.

B0007Z4S4C|1.0|Robert Plant used to be my favorite blues singer of all time. Before he came along, I thought that there would never be anyone who would top the talent and style of Rod Stewart and Jeff Beck together on the \\"Truth\\" LP. But then came Led Zeppelin and everything changed. The way Plant and Page used to interplay on the blues was nothing short of phenominal. You had to be there to fully appreciate it. Their combination of old style black blues with effects-laden hard rock guitar and arrangements just went to the very soul of both blues and rock enthusiasts. Rock fans had different views on  then-current rock super-groups such as the Doors...Hendrix...and even the Beatles (especially the Beatles.) But I never met one rock fan who didn't like Led Zeppelin.But guess all good things must pass. This CD is another spaced-out, indulgent waste of time by a man who has all the talent in the world, but whose musical tastes have gotten so extreme that he has drifted far away from the style of music that made him what he is today. Plant needs Page to balance him out and keep his feet on the ground and his mind out of Hare Khrisna. The production and musicianship on the album are impeccable and I guess it does fit into some kind of abstract \\"Indian/Eastern/Rock\\" genre,if you're into Indian/Eastern/rock things. If you're not, then pass this one over. Just go back and listen to Led Zeppelin I and II again and I think you will be surprisingly satisfied with the best blues/rock ever recorded on vinyl.
0553573403|5.0|So we embark on the Song of Ice and Fire series with the first book being \\"A Game of Thrones\\". It is a book of deceit, betrayal, brutality, romance, death, war, ingredients for pure reading pleasure. I guarantee if you pick up this book, that is exactly what you will receive, a pleasure to read. Personally, this was one I could not put down. I will list what I personally loved about George R. R. Martins \\"Game of Thrones\\".<br /><br />1) Character depth - The characters in this book are so well developed. You get such a good feel for who they are and exactly how they will react in certain situations they are put in. Although, you are quite surprised sometimes...<br /><br />2) Character evolution - It is amazing to watch the characters, change, mature, grow, demature, etc. in this book. This fact will make you change your opinions on characters, grow to absolutely love character, or grow to loathe them...its up to you.<br /><br />3) Plot complexity - This book follows an usual format. Each chapter is from a different characters standpoint at where they are in the story. The fact that it was always jumping from one character to the next, whether I hated the character or loved them, I couldn't wait to see what they were about to embark on.<br /><br />4) The Element of Surprise - This book will shock you at points. Just when you think the unthinkable will never happen it does. There were points when a characters actions would come out of nowhere to completely shock me, and bait me to read on..and on...<br /><br />5) Realism - Unlike many fantasy books you will find today, this book is well...not really fantasy, if that makes sense. It focuses so little on magic (actually none I can think of in this book), wizardry, mythical beasts, the ever-present unsuspecting coming from nowhere hero (so far there isn't a hero of the series). Instead, it is all the complexity of human interaction and the politics of ruling a land and where you stand with your a) family b) \\"thought to be\\" friends c) allies or even d) ancient allegiances.<br /><br />6) Environment complexity - Along with what I said before with each chapter going to another character, it will usually go to another physical location (depending on where the character happens to be at that point). This was a great stimulus. I loved going from the grassy plains of the Dothraki people to the icy north of the wall to the mountain castle of the Eyrie. It seemed to keep my brain into it instead of the same geography from one page to the next.<br /><br />7) No Good vs Evil - It is interesting to note that Martin never really spells out who is good or who is bad in this book. I found myself liking characters on both sides of the thrown, and hating just the same. In this book, everyone is in the same game, just some use different tactics to get what they want. It's up to you to decide whose side you're on. This is something you don't get in a lot of books, makes for a wondeful reading experience.<br /><br />At the moment, that is all I can think of. But...WARNING, this book as I said before is...brutal! Martin doesn't hold back in the \\"romantic\\" scenes, violence is something I can personally handle and I don't recall there being an overabundance in this first book but it is there. There is also some swearing, just like we hear in real life. I guess thats just how you can sum it up, realistic fantasy...I'm not saying this book is without it's living dead people and direwolves or even...yes, dragons...<br /><br />Overall, if you're a fantasy reader and are looking for something new and truly a joy to read. I guarantee you'll love \\"A Game of Thrones\\" by George R. R. Martin. So do yourself a huge favor and read this book...I guarantee the rest of the series will soon follow.<br /><br />Thank you for your time, enjoy.\\"thought to be\\" friends c) allies or even d) ancient allegiances.  <br /> <br />6) Environment complexity - Along with what I said before with each chapter going to another character, it will usually go to another physical location (depending on where the character happens to be at that point).

B000077VPU|5.0|While I realise that it seems I have missed half of this concert by not having the original VHS copy........I don\\"t care. Just to see Daltry do I Want It All, Seal air Who Wants To Live Forever? to 75000 captive hearts and to join in with Paul Young on the stadium-stopper Radio Ga Ga .......thats enough for me. Watching the late and absolute genius of Mick Ronson back alongside Bowie after so many years was worth the price of the DVD ALONE!!!! its a treat that I shall keep forever.....but Who Wants To Live Forever?
B0009AM5JA|4.0|when i first heard about the new Coldplay album I was expecting to hear another fantastic album by a fantastic band. I'm not going to say I was disappointed but I did think it was going to be better. Don't get me wrong, it is a good album and if you like Coldplay you should go buy the album. When i first heard a couple of the songs like &quot;White Shadows&quot; it reminded me of Interpol because of the beat and guitar. This is probably their best song but &quot;Speed of Sound&quot; is oddly like &quot;Clocks&quot; and it will probably get a lot more radio play.
B00097A5HW|5.0|To quickly summarize, Shakira's new album, I must say that this CD will be a classic.  Each and every song have something to offer to the listener.   \\"La Pared\\" and \\"No\\" or by far two of the most sentimental songs, which not only privide a sense of  vulnerability, but a sense of desperation.   \\"Las de la Intuicion\\" is a beautifully written song with electro-pop sounds.  It is the least \\"Shakira-esque\\" song in the recording, but one of her best.  This song will definitely be a hit when it comes out especially in Europe and the U.S. latin market.  It will be played in all markets; a it will be a dance/club/disco classic as well.   <br /> <br />Other songs are reminiscent of Brazilian 1960's, Gilberto with \\"Obtener un Si\\".    <br /> <br />I highly reccomend this CD, as it will satisfy anyone with taste in music and will convert many others to different music genres.
0375404783|5.0|Poor Bridget Jones! Thirty something, unmarried, neurotic, desperately lonely and working in a career she hates. She eats, drinks and smokes too much, obsesses about her weight and is desperate to get the attention of her flirty boss, the self-absorbed and hedonistic Daniel. Bridget's acute perception seems to end when it comes to analyzing her own life, and she can be shallow, self-pitying, delusional and sly -- when she is not trying so hard to please everyone else. Her diary spans a calendar year of her life as she navigates the loneliness of being a \\"singleton,\\" the manic antics of her mother, the latest self-help guide and a garden basket of dysfunctional friends. All the while fending off attempts by her parents and their friends to marry her off by reminding her constantly (\\"Tick Tock! Tick Tock!\\") of her advancing biological clock.<br /><br />BJD captures brilliantly the anxieties and contradictions of our age. Its singles are dying for marital stability but put off by middle class banality. Its marrieds long for freedom from children and responsibility. Bridget herself veers crazily between a life of infinite choice and one often spent depressed and alone.<br /><br />BJD's characters are appallingly wonderful. Bridget's dotty mother, with her Portuguese paramour and wild ways; Mark Darcy, the dull, recently-divorced barrister in diamond-pattern cardigan and bumblebee socks; Perpetua, the big-bottomed terror of Bridget's office; Richard Finch, the incoherent producer of the celebrity-mad \\"Good Afternoon!\\" television show; and Bridget's cast of dysfunctional yet sweet office friends - Jude, Shaza and gay Tom.<br /><br />Kudos to Helen Fielding for assembling such a wild group and making it human, repulsive, likable and real. Sadly, the 6-cassette unabridged narration by Barbara Rosenblat (an utter joy!) no longer seems available. Check your local library!
B000002UAO|5.0|This is a wonderful album and when actually looked at shows The Beatles growing as musicians moving away from the same old pop. My dad and one of his friends were djs when this album was released and they have always said that it started out sounding like a \\"Beatles\\" album, but when Norwegian Wood came on it was just \\"WOW\\". This is one of the most important records in the development of the Beatles and the sound of the 60's afterward.<br /><br />However one of the main things I noticed with older reviews is the confusion over the track listing.<br /><br />For the record:<br /><br />1. This is the original U.K track listing (released before the U.S version)<br /><br />2. The album titles, releases, and track listings differed between the U.S and U.K (due to executives at Capitol)until 1967 (Sgt. Pepper) when the Beatles put in their contract renewal with Capitol that track listings must follow the U.K listings (which had obviously been disregarded prior to this).<br /><br />3. There for the listings to some albums may be different (or albums may not be on cd) the listings on the cds are how they were originally intedned to be heard.<br /><br />This is a great album and I have recomended it to any friends who have started to get into the beatles. (on a side note i would just like to post one argument against those who call classic rock and early metal \\"talentless\\", here it goes \\"of course the \\"old guys\\" don't sound exactly like the artists who to you define the genre simply because they were busy trying to create what would eventually become the genre you love\\"
0452284392|3.0|In \\"Linked,\\" Barabasi does a commendable job in explaining the nitty gritty of network analysis to newbies unversed in this fascinating new science. Barabasi sets up a great foundation, although the book does leave much to be desired: there is no real information as to how individuals can apply the theoretical principles Barabasi explains to practical situations. A book that does just that is \\"The Hidden Power of Social Networks,\\" by Rob Cross and Andrew Parker. That book is also more appropriate for the business executive -- although it presupposes that the reader is familiar with much of the basics of network analysis (the kind of information Barabasi magnificiently explains). All in all, a great introductory read to the science of network analysis -- but expect to need more to be truly satisfied.

0743243315|2.0|My cute wife screens many books for me after she reads them. She told me not to read this one. I read the back of the book and it sounded great to me. Against her advice, I started reading the book. I absolutely loved the first 115 pages. (I could not understand why my wife told me not to read it. I complained to her and wanted to revisit all the other books that she told me not to read. I thought she knew my tastes very well ... Or did she? Maybe, I thought, I should have a serious talk with her.)     Book begins with a story of a woman from Bangladesh who is married off to a man 20 years older than her in London. Ali does an outstanding job developing Nazneen (the protagonist) and Chanu's (Nazneen's husband) character. Then the book takes a drastic turn on page 116. Ali proceeds to summarize about 13 years through Hasina's (Nazneen's sister who still lives in Bangladesh) poorly written letters. The letters make up one chapter which is only about 20 pages long. There are more letters spread throughout the book later. I found reading those letters extremely awkward and painful. Later on in the book I resorted to skipping the letters altogether. After that painful chapter, the book never picks up. It is as if a new person starts writing the book. Nazneen starts having an affair and we hear a little about her 2 daughters. Ali did a poor job making the reader understand what the daughters were all about. I found the affair quite unrealistic. Worst of all, the book became boring.     I just finished the book but I should have listened to my wife and never started the book.
B0009AM5JA|5.0|This is an amazing album.I can't stop listening to this.Other reviewers say it's not good, but I totally disagree.Usually I like alot harder style music. But Coldplay is such a talented band they arent afraid to explore new musical horizons, but they do it using clever and indirect methods to achieve it.I really really love the song Talk.And I love the song Low as well.But the whole thing is AMAZING!Buy this Album! ps-And the Lyrics are cool too!

B0006L16N8|5.0|I have to admit, I wasn't the biggest Coldplay fan before I purchased this album. I own AROBTTH, but was not completely infatuated with Coldplay as a band. But their new album X&Y has definitely made me a big fan. I am surprised by the new record. I didn't know what to expect, because to be honest, I really didn't play their previous recording that much. Okay, rarely. Of course I enjoyed all the big name songs like CLOCKS and THE SCIENTIST, but that was about as far as my Coldplay love went at that time. Although, I could hear the potential for something great. Thankfully, Coldplay is turning out to be the band that people expected. X&Y has assured me that their previous sales success was no fluke. The sound and production are bigger and slicker this time around, but the heart and soul just keeps growing. Bands like Coldplay don't come around that often. There's usually 1 or 2 in your lifetime if you're lucky. If Coldplay keeps producing interesting and enchanting music, they might be that special band that ends up outlasting all the others. The fans are there. But it's up to them now to keep the momentum going. With songs like WHAT IF, WHITE SHADOWS, SPEED OF SOUND, and TWISTED LOGIC they have set the bar so high, that their next album should be a formidable challenge that we all can look forward to. It will be interesting to see how they top X&Y. No easy task.

B0009A1AS2|4.0|Ok, must admit, I half expected a continuation of the edgy guitar riff heavy effort that Train of Thought was. Man was I surprised! As mentioned before, this CD is more melodic in nature and that is a good thing. Let's face it; you can only do so much crunch and it all starts to sound the same.  <br /> <br />Will not go into an opus of a review. Most everything I love about the CD has been eluded to already. Just go out and get it is my only other input.

B0006SSOHC|4.0|I'm not much of a movie buff, but I do like Mystery-Suspense-Thriller type movies.  \\"SAW\\" is one of the best movies of that genre that I've seen in a long time.  It starts off with a bang, and ends with a bigger bang!  It has lots of gore if you like that.  But most importantly, it makes you think and wonder about how things came about...all your questions might not be answered but hey, it's a highly entertaining movie, with a super cool ending, in my opinion!

I've listened to the other to albums and love them both and this sounds like avenged sevenfold to me. I think everyone is griping because this is their first album with a major record label. I'll just be honest real quick and say that this album rocks and you need to go out and buy it. Don't listen to all these haters on here that don't know what they're talkin about. THIS ALBUM IS AWESOME!!!!!

B000002UJQ|5.0|I'm gonna go ahead and admit that I'm a fan of all of Radiohead's albums. I have had OK Computer for over 2 years now, and it finds itself in my car cd player at one point in every single day. (I wish I would have caught onto Radiohead earlier, before I was 18, but I guess it takes an older, more mature listener to catch onto a band as solid as Radiohead). <br />I could sing praises about this album for the rest of my life. It's legendary. Not as clever and imaginative as Kid A in my opinion, but my god, this is one hell of an album. <br />Everytime I listen to \\"Airbag\\" I get goosebumps on my arms and neck. <br />OK Computer rocks
B00005B4GU|3.0|Oh Radiohead...  How you have come to emblematize wishy washy emosad while staying true to HOLYCRAPWHATWASTHATNOISE(it's all distant, like I'm standing on lichen or something).  You get me, right? <br /> <br />Please let us put Thom Yorke's silliness aside.  Being the heir to European pop star communism as an apprentice under Africa-love Bono, it's hard to put that aside and realize that the bloke and his buddies really can make crap that's worthwhile, even if it is Autechre and Aphex Twin put through the indierock mop bucket (what's good about this is it's a lot more human than said Warp records allumni). <br /> <br />Revolving doors revolve and it's all the same, years of waiting, etc.  It's a bit boring.  Those simple sentiments that make a Radiohead song (Reasonable man, etc) come into full force right away. Perhaps too soon.  (2/5) <br /> <br />Pyramid Song:  It's the song.  From the few piano chords to the spacy jumping into rivers with angels lyrics, it's everything a Radiohead song should be.  The production is lovely, lush, enveloping.  It was this song that made me realize that I didn't really care for The Bends or OK Computer like I used to.  Sure theres only 5 or 6 odd chords in the song, but that doesn't matter because its purty.  (5/5) <br /> <br />Pulkblahblah Doors:  I'm not sure I'm buying the full-on-IDM Radiohead. The lyrics are sure damned Thom Yorkeish though.  No one can touch that ace goulash.  (3/5) <br /> <br />You and whose army: Ahhh the production value.  It sounds like it was recorded in an oversized guinea pig cage in a Manhattan sewer.  It's lovely.  The whole Roman Empire symbolism is pretty ominous I suppose.  Totally caberet, smokey, seedy, bunch of punks selling us out in the back room style.  It made me sufficiently sad.  4/5 <br /> <br />I might be wrong... I get the point, maybe, but it's a bit boring. :(  2/5 <br /> <br />Knives Out: You can just see Harrison Ford running from the police trying to find out who framed him, WHO HAS THE PROSTHETIC ARM ?!?!?!?!?  The jangle-picking reminds me of wet grass in Ontario. I like that, a lot.  How did he live jumping off the dam?  Thom Yorke knows..  (5/5) <br /> <br />Morning bell PT TWO:  A little more morning a little less GOOD <br />(2/5) <br /> <br />Dollars and Cents: spooky, but i'm not buying it.  Too WorldPokerTournament and not enough CIA giving tax breaks to major airlines (2.5/5) <br /> <br />Hunting Bears: STFU. 1/5 <br /> <br />Like Spinning Plates:  If Pyramid Song were the answer to everything crappy in this world, this is the question.. Cash money all around.  The Sndrec32.exe backwarded chord progression makes me automatically sad.  He didn't even need to sing.  But then he does and I am devastated.  OK, maybe not devastated but it's pretty bawls.  Outro like a dying planet.  That kicks the ol' gut in and I'm through. 6/5 <br /> <br />Life in a glass house:  I'm not sure whats going on here exactly, you had me at track 10.  Maybe I'm not indie enough.  Not much going on aside from \\"Hey you, make some kind of melody over this already lacklluster set of piano chords.  It's kind of regretful sounding, but I'm already beyond that... Maybe that's the point at the end of a strange disco compacto.  3/5
6305537321|5.0|ever since i was a little kid, i would feel so good everytime i watched this movie. Something about the story and the score just makes me feel so great!!! DEfinitley one to watch on a rainy day. I only wish they would come out with a special edition DVD because this film deserves a way better trasnfer with bonus material. The only thing this one has to offer is a theatrical trailer! The acting is great, and i wish there were more movies like this out there today... This film will make you laugh, cry, and just fall in love with the most memorable characters you would ever see walk across the screen.
0142000655|5.0|John Steinbeck's work deserves the attention it receives.  In the masterpiece \\"East of Eden\\", the reader looks deep into the human soul to see tragedy over two generations of a family.  With a story that parallels Cain and Abel from the Bible, readers may have familiarity with the general theme.  However, the final story takes a more modern twist.    Even in his childhood, Adam Trask is simple.  He is dominated by a military minded father and an intimidating brother.  Motherless since his birth, he learns many of life's lessons the hard way.  After returning from a tour of duty in the military forced by his father, destiny literally comes to Adam's front door.  After being badly beaten by a client, Katherine crawls to his front porch for help.  Having inherited money from his father, Adam takes in Katherine and cares for her despite his brother Charles's objection.  Katherine and Adam eventually marry and move to California.  When they arrive, Katherine becomes pregnant.  After giving birth, she leaves her husband and newborns to start a brothel.  This leaves Adam alone and devestated again.      The twins are a reflection of their father and his brother.  Cal is rough around the edges much like Charles. Aron is soft much like his father.  With their mother absent physically and their father emotionally vacant, the boys are raised by their father's Asian housekeeper Lee.  As they grow, the boys are unaware of their mother's career.  Cal learns first.  When he tells Aron who has returned from college, Aron is so devestated that he joins the military to fight in World War II.  In effect, Aron loses his will to live.  When Aron is killed in action, the boys' father has a stroke.  Cal takes the burden of his brother's death and his father's stroke on himself in much the same way his brother and father accepted various burdens.  Had he not told Aron about their mother, Cal feels that Aron would have never joined the military.  As a result, the burden of guilt and sin lives in another generation.    While the book runs off track at times, the story and its human interactions are fascinating.  I remain undisappointed by any work by John Steinbeck.  Certainly, this is among his best works.
B00097A5HW|2.0|I've been a fan of Shakira for a long time but this album is really bad. La tortura is a very great song and very deep but the others are to boring and the music is not like her at all. Think twice before buying this album. But if you are a Shakira fan go ahead but you've been warned.
B0007NFL1S|2.0|Garbage.  this album is an insult to hip-hop.  if your looking for another \\"Get Rich or Die Trying\\" you will be sadly disappointed.  Any \\"talent\\" he had is right out the window, no originality, no depth, no metaphors, no punchlines and to top it all off the production is played. Please save your money, cop some Tupac or Nas, leave fifty's sh*t on the shelf, any tru hip hopper knows the real sh*t, this aint it.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Yes I am probab;y a DT whore...but that said I love this CD. Every song speaks to me on some level... some songs just took longer to make it through my skull. The cd finally burst through on the 3:00am can't sleep drive when you want to listen to something loud but meighbors and family say go to sleep you a**h*le. Octavarium runs the gamut from hard to soft, technically frenzied to simply beautiful. You even get U2's best song since the Achtung Baby cd. Yes it is very U2ish(Is that a word) but a great song is a great song. Best cd ,for me, of 2005 since Masterplan - Aeronautics.
B000023VR6|5.0|This is by far on of the largest production acheivements ever made. These beats will never be duplicated and Dr. Dre's lyrics aside, you have Snoop at some of his best work, Xhibit in his prime, Em on a track and Hitman to back Dre up. I love Dre but for those who are skeptical, this album will stay in your CD player long after you buy it, Dre the best producer of our time, hands down and is the best producer on the mic. Def cop this. <br />
B0000VCZKW|3.0|WHY, oh, WHY wasn't this made into a widescreen special edition?  Some of the special features are even in widescreen.  What in the world is up with that??  I enjoyed the special features, but wish there had been more (like a commentary).  I don't get why they wasted time in making this without using the widescreen format.  I feel like I've been taken.   <br /> <br />About the movie:  this is a favorite in our family.  It's a bit dark, and some people are upset by it, but there's a positive message and a happy ending (oops, was that a spoiler?)  I highly recommend it, and probably the best age to see this would be 6 or 7 and up, depending on how sensitive your child is.
B000002B5L|5.0|The Score is classic Hip Hop album that any tru fan should have in their collection.  Lauryn Hill's artistic ghetto lyrics and her unmatched flow is unparalleled by any other female artist.  Pras drops the sick beats, totally unique to the Fugees, nothin commercial about this at all.  Wyclef is decent at best, he goes off on tangents and starts rambling, they are good at first but really start to get on your nerves after a few listens but Lauryn Hill holds the whole thing together, a must have.
B00000255F|5.0|You have read all about the songs, and the enthusiasm and energy this album generates is real. If you love rock 'n roll you need to own this album.<br /><br />How can you believe in the power of music and NOT respond to lines like these from Thunder Road?<br /><br />\\"Show a little faith, there's magic in the night; you ain't a beauty but hey, you're alright.\\"<br /><br />Sometimes an album really is THAT good. It could change you. So roll down the window and let the wind blow back your hair.<br /><br />Enjoy the record.
B0002IQAD6|5.0|There will never be another album like this ever. Biggie's flow is God-like, the metaphors he drops are mind boggiling and his punchlines are exceeded by few, maybe Big L, maybe.  The production is perfect for Big, there isnt a bad track on this CD, front to back.  Tracks like One More Chance, Gimme the Loot, Ready to Die are all that will relinquish your love for hip hop if for some reason it has gone dead.  Line after Line he kills it, if you dont have this yet, you NEED it.
B0007CNXUK|1.0|Who would want to find Neverland, just so they can never grow up like Peter Pan what a childish name for a movie. Johnny Depp is too good to be playing in boring movies like this.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|Seeing THE MACHINIST for the first time is a grim ride, relieved in the last few minutes by an act of self-redemption for the main character, Trevor Reznick. If one allows the film to cast its spell, there is a sense of gratitude for the way it sets up the protagonist's stuggle and eventual victory. Reviewers like Dennis Lim of THE VILLAGE VOICE emphasize the look of Christian Bale's emaciated body and the settings (e.g. stormy, dimly lit, frayed), and harp on the film's debt to pop culture in the goth-grunge vein. In describing this work, an emphasis on style is, I think, a way of exaggerating style's role in the film in order to discount its other aspects. In addition, focusing on the flashback sequence (\\"the twist,\\" as it is incorrectly described) obscures the logic and symbolism of the film as a whole. This is important, because there is little in this nightmarish story to find pleasure in, except the way it is written and lensed.     There is indeed \\"meat on the bones\\" of THE MACHINIST's screenplay. As some have noted, the dialogue sounds unnatural in several of the longer speaking scenes, but this seems to be part of the effort to make Trevor's life ring false to the mind's ear. A great deal of the world that Trevor inhabits feels dishonest, like an elaborate contruction that he tries to prop himself up with. His relationships with women, his co-workers (both real and imagined), and daylight are all depicted as threats to his exposure. This is strange to see, since Trevor's nakedness and his apparent desire to seek and discover, are also important aspects of his character.    The most disturbing thing about Trevor Reznick's psychology is that, unlike the gleeful pop-goth nihilism of his cultural namesake (Trent Reznor), he is disgusted by the body and world he's created for himself. He's shown to be capable of thinking reasonably, working long hours (there's a Marxist thread here if you choose to follow it), and functioning sympathetically in various relationships, but something inhuman, outside reason, is eating him. The Lady Macbeth hand washing, the murder fantasies, the unfinished meals (of both love and food): all suggest that something has made him yearn for cleanliness. This is an epic of guilt, but it is also sweetly pathetic in its depiction of Trevor's world. The many gritty details, employed to construct a handful of characters, are thoughtfully woven together to create a picture that is paradoxically both realistic and fantastic. THE MACHINIST is not magic-realism, however; It simply places us in the protagonist's uneasy head space.    Though caught in a world of guilt and self-delusion, Trevor's foundational tormentor, his prime mover, is the machine, from which horror is born only with the help of machinists. This is different from Kubrick's 2001', in which the murderous computer, HAL, is given almost supernatural independence from it's masters, though the criminal computer, like the principle crime in THE MACHINIST, ultimately serves to distinguish humanity from its tools. For most of THE MACHINIST, this distinction is impossible, but when the protagonist grasps it in the final scene, it feels hard-won and genuine. The distinction is hard-won because Trevor's perverse desire to be rid of his body stems from his intimacy with the machine. He works with heavy machinery, in spite of sleep deprivation, and at one point choses to be struck by a car. Of course, the impact doesn't kill him - the writer (Scott Kosar) wouldn't let him off that easily. For Trevor, the act of running, restlessly, provides both false hope of escape and a painful reminder of his crime as a mere human.
B00005JKLZ|1.0|Don't see this movie you'll regret it. Most sci-fi movies are stupid. Nobody cares about some machine plotting people 800,000 years into the future I have to admit the graphics looks good that's about the best they can do in this movie. The orginal movie was made in 1960.
1400032717|1.0|A few pages in and I've already noticed a series of errors: <br /> <br />The protagonist has no trouble understanding symbolic representations of faces and matching them to real faces, has an excellent memory, yet needs to carry around a cheat sheet of face symbols. <br /> <br />Actually it's very easy to tell if a large number is prime or not. The only difficulty lies in factoring large numbers. Someone who cared about such things would know this. <br /> <br />The paragraph and sentence lengths do not follow a Gaussian distribution. <br /> <br />This book is like a big unwanted patronizing hug. It makes me feel sick.

B0007M22TI|1.0|I saw Celtic Woman on PBS which was closed-captioned. Then decided to purchase the DVD.  <br /> <br />Guess what? No closed-captioning or subtitles! <br /> <br />No wonder Amazon's listing doesn't say about closed-captioning or subtitles. <br /> <br />Their show ranked a 5 but I'm giving it a 1 because I can't enjoy it.  <br /> <br />Oh well, back to the store it goes for a refund. Will this get Manhattan Record's attention now?
B00005JLYW|1.0|This movie does not deserve a review, with such a pitiful story line, combined with a very patronising view on the way men percieve women... Id say this movie sucks and the general consesnsus would be widely viewed with similar opinions. <br />If you ever watch this, please watch those bowels and at all costs avoid contact
0790729369|5.0|Many people know me for my penchant with horror and science fiction movies. You have only to read the vast majority of the reviews I have posted here to ascertain that fact for yourself. Catching me in front of a film like this, although I do happen to enjoy dramas, is both rare and altogether surprising.    \\"The Bridges of Madison County\\" is quite possibly the single most beautiful motion picture I have ever seen in my entire life! I never took the time to read James Waller's novel, because everyone I asked said it was terrible. This film adaptation, however, will bring the most jaded person to flooding tears. I can say that because I, myself, break down each and every time I watch it. The plot deals with some rather sensitive issues, to be sure. But it also touches upon raw emotions of such gentle intimacy that so few other films of this specific genre have the courage to explore.    Clint Eastwood is a visionary wonder. His talent astonishes me to no conceivable end, and he just did a phenomenal job at putting this film together. He not only directed and starred, but he also helped write the film's unforgettable musical score.     Speaking of music, this has a soundtrack you would be hard pressed to beat. From Dinah Washington and Irene Kral to Johnny Hartman and Barbara Lewis, this is music that moves you as much as the movie itself.    Mere words are simply not enough to express the sheer adoration I have for this production. It is a first-rate movie from a master craftsman in top form. Do not pass it up.
B00005QIPH|5.0|I like everything on this cd from Is this it? to Soma to Automatic Stop.Its all good and i like every song on this and normally i dont like new rock bands but this one is really good.BUY IT!
B000000WF0|3.0|This is one of my favorites in my collection although I have very rarely listened to it from beginning to end all the way through. That's because for every, truly classic recording, there is a song after it that does nothing for me. I almost always have the skip button ready. The best tracks therein: 1, 2, 4, 7, 9, and 10. Bittersweet Symphony is so magnificently cinematic; Every time I hear it, my cinematographic sensibilities are heightened to the nth degree. As marvelous as the accompanying promo vid clip for this song is, I could add to its majesty with certain visuals I could only frame using a large-format, like IMAX. The other tracks posess such warmth and amazing arrangement. Every time I hear them my hair stands on end. Their production quality is nonpareil and I could listen to them forever. But as I said, the other songs do come off as filler. As an EP, it would get a flawless 5 star rating.
B00008J4P5|5.0|This cd opened my life up to the white stripes and now I am one of there diehard fans.After this cd, I realized the White stripes rock so i bought there first cd(The white stripes),2nd cd(De Stijl) and 3rd cd(white blood cells) and now i have there 5th cd(Get behind me satan) and i highly recommend ALL of them.They rock.The songs on these cd are ALL Good and thats hard to say about most cds.I listen to every single song on this cd and am not disappointed at all.I highly suggest track2,5,7,8,9 and 10.Those are the best but the others are good as well.BUY IT!
B00006CXSS|5.0|Thank you to our veterans! Watching this film was a personally transforming experience.  My appreciation and grattitude to our veterans was deepened, my emotions were profoundly touched, and my love for our nation was inspired!
B000002H97|5.0|Yet again, I realize that by saying that, I am beating a dead horse, but I'm serious. Yes, this is the album that entered Metallica into the mainstream. Yes, I do much prefer the '80s Metallica (which is, in my mind, untouchable) But it's still a really good album, standing alone on its own merit, and it's worthy of it's spot on most \\"best of the '90s\\" lists. <br /> <br />I remember as a 10-year-old kid, watching the \\"Enter Sandman\\" video for the first time, thinking \\"Cool!\\" So yes, this is the album that got me into Metallica. It wasn't long before I owned a copy of the \\"Black Album\\" (although the cover may or may not have been ripped off from \\"This Is Spinal Tap\\"), and to this day, it still sounds good. The hits \\"Enter Sandman\\", \\"Sad But True\\" (the lyrics eerily foreshadowing the Metallica of today to come), \\"The Unforgiven\\", and the soft, flowing ballad \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" still get me singing along, but also worth mention are the rockers \\"Through The Never\\" and \\"The Struggle Within\\", and the mid-tempo ode to the creatures of the night, \\"Of Wolf And Man\\". Oh yeah, and the others aren't bad either. <br /> <br />If you asked me to pick between this and \\"Master Of Puppets\\", I'd take Master Of Puppets. No question. This and \\"Ride The Lightning\\"? Same. \\"Kill 'Em All\\" and \\"...And Justice For All\\"? You know it. But I still like this album and rediscover it from time to time. I honestly can't give this any less than full marks. It's a classic for me. Sadly, as we all know, this is where Metallica jumped the shark. After this it went from boring (the Loads) to just plain, flat-out absymal (St. Anguish), so all this re-inforces the review title. <br /> <br />I think many fans would dub Metallica unforgiven for St. Anguish, though. (Sorry, I had to use that pun.)
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Right before I wrote this one off I went back through the tracks, this time I removed my judges robe and put the gavel away and just listened.  -This album is pretty solid-.   <br />If you have been turned off by Dream Theater in the past because of too much embellishment then you might want to check this out.
B0000E5PEE|5.0|This is one of the best albums I've ever heard. <br />Ennio Morricone had known Dulce Pontes for many years, but he refused to work with her saying that her voice wasn't ripe. <br />Now we can see why... Morricone is a genious and managed to get the best out of Dulce. <br />It is an album full of emotions, either by the greatness of Morricone's music, either by the feeling that Pontes managed to transmit with her voice. <br />My favorite song is called \\"Amor a Portugal\\". It's a portuguese version of the \\"Your love\\", included in the portuguese edition as an extra track (number 16). It could become the Portuguese National Anthem. <br />As for the comment of one other review comparing Dulce Pontes with Celine Dion, I tottaly can't agree with that. At all. <br />Dulce Pontes is only showing the maturity in her voice. <br />And she's great doing that...
0451529308|5.0|I first read Louisa May Alcott's \\"Little Women\\" the summer between 4th and 5th grades. I was absolutely riveted by the story and characters and clearly remember sitting on the porch steps, my nose in the book. I cried when I reached the conclusion, because I was afraid that I had just read the best book in the world, and that I would never find anything else as good. The local librarian convinced me otherwise. I cannot recommend this novel highly enough - for people of all ages. It will always have a special place in my heart.<br /><br />Ms. Alcott writes about four young women, living in New England, during a period of much strife in America - the Civil War. They are self sufficient, creative and well educated, and each chooses a different life path, traditional and non. Considering the period when the book was written, the author's views on opportunities open to females, restricted though they were by society, is refreshing and liberating. Of course, this was not my focus as a nine year-old. The novel is long, but that never bothered me as a young girl, or much later when I reread it. I didn't want the story to end, actually.<br /><br />Sisters Meg, Jo, Beth, and Amy March and their beloved Marmee, (who offers her daughters guidance, comfort and unconditional love), learn to live in genteel poverty while their father, a doctor, is away treating wounded soldiers. This beautifully written classic, chronicles the girls' adolescence through womanhood, with all their trial, tribulations, and joys.<br /><br />Much of the novel focuses on Jo, the second daughter, and a gifted writer. She is very much a tomboy, and an avid reader who writes plays which the girls act-out with delight and exuberance. When they meet their new next-door neighbor, the wealthy, lonely Theodore Laurence, (called Laurie), they befriend him and invite him to become the only male member of their exclusive theater ensemble. Laurie becomes an important person in all of their lives, and the March family in his. Margaret, (Meg), the oldest, is quite lovely - a young woman with traditional values and tastes. Sensitive Elizabeth, (Beth), is the most fragile sister -quiet, caring and timid. And Amy, the youngest, is a gifted artist, with a tremendous sense of self-importance.<br /><br />Together they cope with their father's absence and their fear for his safety, severe illness in the family, a death, lack of money precluding many of life's small luxuries, romance, love, marriage and many glorious adventures. In the second part of the novel, Meg marries, Jo's writing becomes a priority, as does Amy's art. During a time of impoverishment, they learn how good it feels to give to those who are much needier than themselves. This aspect of the book is very moving. Ms Alcott brings her characters to life on the page. All of them, even minor personages, are extremely well developed.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" was first published in two parts in 1868 and 1869. The author drew from her own childhood experiences to dramatize the lives of the March family. The character \\"Marmee\\" is based on her own mother, Abigail May, (Abba), Alcott, whom she described as having: \\"A great heart that was home for all.\\" Like Marmee, Abba was loving and passionate about women's rights, temperance, and abolition.

0312323859|5.0|When I first started reading something borrowed I was honestly not expecting anything from it.  I am not much of a reader, but let me tell you that I was not able to pu the book down until I was finished it.  Once I finished reading it I looked up Emily Giffin's web site to see if she had another book coming out.  I purchased Something Borrowed in April, and realized that Something blue was not going to be released until the end of May.  I went everywhere looking to see if had been released sooner, but had no luck.  The day that Something Borrowed hit the shelves I was at my local book store to purchase it.  This on is even better than the first one, and I was not able to put it down.  There was something about these two books that just kept me interested.  Maybe it is the fact that they are so realistic, and I can see this happening to someone in real life.  Throughout the book you get to know that characters, and everything about them.  I really hope that there will be another book to go along with theses ones.  I would definetly recommend these books to anyone, and have actaully recommended them to a few different people who are now reading them, and can not put them down either.

B00070Q7VO|2.0|What a strange enterprise this CD is.  Is this supposed to be a tribute to the Frank Sinatra of the 1960s, or a parody?  After thinking about it, I have decided that it's a cheap imitation, like those supermarket recordings of the 1950s that featured unknown talent imitating the original stars of current hits at a bargain price.  There is not one original component in this entire package.  The arrangements are all recycled from either Sinatra or other singers of the period.  (Were they that appealing in the first place?)  Buble is sometimes capable of echoing Sinatra's timbre on certain notes, but, unlike Sinatra, hasn't an ounce of genuine emotion.  Buble recycles material from Nina Simone and Ray Charles as well.  It is at this point that the CD veers into pure kitsch. <br /> <br />Listening to this CD made me realize how good the original recordings of these songs were.  I can't help wondering what audience this CD is trying to reach.  I can't imagine my baby boomer contemporaries liking this album.  Do younger people really like this stuff?  There are obviously some big bucks behind Buble.  I'm guessing he'll \\"reinvent\\" himself ala \\"Madonna\\" and have a whole new act in a couple of years.  He needs to do something (get new management?), because this is not working.  I think there's some talent here, but this is a misguided enterprise.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I just got the CD last night, but it is great! I think that I like \\"What if.\\" and have it on repeat already. :)
B00097A5HW|1.0|This album was a huge disappointment.  I loved her earlier (spanish) stuff because it had an exciting sound that mixed popular latino music with some mediterranean flavour.  In this album she ditches that sound in favour of the synthesiser and electronic drumset sound that was popular in the late 80's.  I knew I made a mistake buying the CD as soon as the first song began.  I can't understand how a high energy artist like Shakira can put a song like En Tus Pupilas as the first track.  This album shows that a singer with a great voice isn't enough.  You need quality sound engineers, mixers, editors, and producers in order to pull off a good album.  Hopefully she can find some for her next album.
B000002UJQ|5.0|First of all, I would like to say I agree with reviewer \\"Nick\\" when he says that this is no doubt, a 5 star album, and should be maintained as such. The album is absolutely brilliant from start to finish. <br /> <br />The album opens with \\"Airbag\\". A relatively straight forward rock 'n' roll song with some neat stop-and-start parts, and is overall a solid opening to the record. We then proceed to \\"Paranoid Android\\", a 6-minute-and-something textured, haunting, and tempo changing masterpiece. After the controlled chaos of track 2, we then get into \\"Subterranean Homesick Alien\\", a calmer, but equally textured tune with haunting lyrics. Then, my favorite track on the album comes, \\"Exit Music (For A Film)\\", which could be one of the most haunting and eerie pieces of music ever made, both musicly and lyricly. Then, we are treated to \\"Let Down\\", a injection of happiness after the heavy track no. 4. Let Down has brilliant lyrics and harmonies. We then proceed to \\"Karma Police\\", a U2-esque piece of piano rock. Then comes \\"Fitter Happier\\", a barely 2 minute interlude piece which creepys the s**t out of me to say the least, it then quickly changes to \\"Electioneering\\", a in-your face grunge tune. Electioneering sounds like what a good rock and roll song should sound like. Then, we go onto \\"Climbing Up The Walls\\", which, for me, is the hardest song to access on the record. It is outfitted in haunting instrumentals and lyrics. Then, we get \\"No Suprises\\", which, like Let Down, has a calmer and more serene prescence to it, with happier melodies. Then, another great highlight is unleashed, \\"Lucky\\", which can be only described with one word \\"BRILLIANT!\\". The album closes with \\"The Tourist\\", a softer restrained song of beauty. <br /> <br />All in all, OK Computer is nothing short of a masterpiece, and definetly should be treated that way.
B00097A5HW|2.0|I find it very sad that after so many years of waiting, Shakira gives us (the latin fans) only 10 songs. I know, quality is better than quantity, but hey, these songs are not that good. I've tried so hard to love this album, but it's a mess. Where did the old Shakira go? Where is the poetry in the lyrics? She's sold herself. Don't come and tell me that she's changed, because changing requires evolution, this is nothing near evolution... I love Shakira and I feel very disappointed. She claims to have written more than 60 songs for this album. Why could'nt she put more songs into this volume? She can't argue that the other songs she wrote didn't fit in this album: this album has NO DIRECTION AT ALL. Even a christmas jingle would have fit in it, so she can't excuse herself with that.  <br /> <br />I feel very disappointed. Shakira, if you were to share with us such crappy songs, why could'nt you -at least- put 16 \\"mediocre\\" songs in the album? Why just 10? I know that, at least, my money would have been worth more.
B0006L16N8|5.0|What a phenomemal album.  In no way was I a huge Coldplay fan, upon purchasing this album.  However, having listened to X&Y through and through several times now, I am confident in stating that this may be one of the most complete albums I have listened to in a long time.  It's a rarity, for me at least, that I pop a cd in the first time and am compelled to listen to the entire album, never skipping over a song, never questioning the value of certain track over the others.  With this album, from start to finish, I found myself tingling with each and every song.  The essence of Coldplay had never been apparent to me.  Now, it is.  Melodic, profound, eccentric?  Screw lyrics, let the music take you over, play it loud, and lose yourself in this cd.  As a huge fan of \\"music\\" in general, this cd gets my vote as one of the best I've purchased in years.
B0007TKNL0|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie!! Enough to have watched it two times two days in a row and I could certainly watch it again today.  While I haven't yet had the privilege of seeing the original play on Broadway, I thought this version was truly spectacular and beautiful.  Emmy Rossum sings like an angel, Gerard Butler's voice is sexy, mysterious and a bit rough... kinda like the Phantom, and the rest of the cast was brilliant too. I was a smidge disappointed to learn that it wasn't really Minnie Driver singing her part as I really love her as an actor.  The sets and costumes were perfect, the atmosphere was amazing.  To me this film was perfect and I am sure I will continue to enjoy it for years to come.  Hope this was helpful. :)
B00003CXCT|5.0|First off, I've watched every version of the old trilogy of Star Wars and I found this DVD set very pleasing to the eyes. Visually, it's absolutly stunning and I don't know what people are complaining about, George Lucas simply re-edited the trilogy so it can appeal to audiences for years to come so that it is up there with Episode I, II, and III in the visual effects category. I didn't think the changes were too extreme but was thoroughly pleased not only with how this DVD really cleaned up the picture but the sound quality which is superb. I personally liked the new Ewok song better as I think it really fit into the whole mood of the scene. The Star Wars movies have done something that not many  movies have done before; it has the perfect blend of scifi action, drama, romance, and humour and George has outdone himself again with the release of a truly great DVD set to the greatest movie trilogy of all time.
B00005JNTX|1.0|I think that sin city is probably the worst movie I have ever seen.  It has the pathetic capability to be looked at as a comedy like Starship Troopers, yet carries questionable scenes and voice over that make me wonder if the filmakers took themselves seriously.  Either way, the final product is a complete joke.  The style of the film is essentially the bones of the film.  It makes no difference, becuase there is no effort to make every shot flow into an actual piece of visual mastery.  Either the visual concept wasn't fluid, or the editing was done by an inbred fan of \\"children of the Living Dead.  The acting was interesting, and basically terrible.  Clive Owen posessed the clever death tactic of drowning people in the toilet which realy wasn't as funny as it sounds because the charachters would force out their pathetic dialouge that touched on some form of phylisophical darkness posessed by pompus Eighth grade maralyn manson fans who cut their wrists and wear short sleaved slipnot t-shirts just to brag of their misery.   <br />I wanted to watch the car chase that was directed by Quentin Tarentino, but I had given up hope so I left.  My logic told me that a car chase, even if it was directed by quentin tarentino cannot save a movie posessing a chuck taylor-wearing villain who eat's people's souls.   <br />Even if Orson welles walked onto the set and redirected and stared in the whole rest of the movie, it probably wouldn't have done much good for the fate of this film.  I have decided that Hollywood is way too rich.  If it can blow millions of dollars on this complte atrocity of a film, I have lost all respect for the film industry.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|There have been some controversial made-for-TV movies over the years, but I don't think any of them compare to The Day After.  This is the most-talked-about TV movie I've seen in my thirty-four years.  I didn't watch it when it was initially aired on ABC in 1983, which is odd because I started nursing a fear of nuclear war around that same time during my childhood.  It's something every Cold War child went through at some point, although I know my own experience paled considerably compared to those coming of age in the 1950s and 1960s.  I was also forming my political opinions at that age, as well, and perhaps I didn't watch the movie because of the political agenda behind it.  Liberals feared Ronald Reagan at this time, fearing he would actually start a nuclear war, and that kind of political sentiment, in my opinion, lay behind this film.  Of course, despite such fears by some, President Reagan went on to end the Cold War altogether.<br /><br />The Day After was - and still is - a terrifying motion picture that purports to show what happens when the politicians stop making speeches and let the bombs fly.  The thing about nuclear war is that it just keeps on giving - or, I should say - taking.  Those who die in the initial explosion are the lucky ones, as the survivors must face a decimated, increasingly atavistic society struggling to find sustenance and medical attention (useless though it is) even as they slowly die from radiation poisoning.  Make no mistake - this movie was intended to frighten the American people.  Frighten them it did.  Anti-nuclear activism was given a tremendous boost in terms of popular appeal - until the fervor was dragged down alongside Walter Mondale's silly pledge to raise taxes in the 1984 election.<br /><br />After an hour or so of introducing us to several characters in the heartland of America - Kansas City and its outlying areas - the impetus of military clashes in Germany all too suddenly turns the Cold War red hot, and a full nuclear exchange takes place between the United States and the Soviet Union.  Panic ensues as the local population watches the nearby silos unleash one ICBM after another, knowing Soviet nukes are only minutes away from their otherwise peaceful skies.  You get a good couple of minutes of nuclear destruction as Soviet nukes explode all over the atmosphere of the area.  The mushroom clouds hit the viewer with great force.  Numerous Americans are quickly vaporized (you see a quick X-ray image of them before they disappear), and wholesale destruction is wrought on basically everything.  The final hour of the movie focuses on the survivors and the dire situation they find themselves in.  The entire cast is high caliber, but Jason Robards truly shines as the university doctor who stumbles back to campus and organizes his medical crew to do what they can against insurmountable odds.  We also follow the fate of a farm family holed up in their cellar for days before emerging back into the light after radiation levels fall down to a survivable rate.  It's an awful situation that only gets worse, as no one is safe from the deadly fallout - or their suddenly desperate fellow man.<br /><br />Watching this film again now, I could not help but think how overly optimistic the film is, in a sense.  As a note as the end of the movie informs the viewer, the effects of a nuclear attack would be far, far worse than you see here.  One kid is blinded by a nuclear explosion, but in reality many people would basically have their eyes melted out of their heads.  Radiation poisoning in the movie basically consists of a growing lethargy, rotting body parts, and hair loss - there's no sign of the deathly nausea and other symptoms that would ensue.  The mushroom clouds themselves look altogether too small for such nuclear detonations, as well.<br /><br />This wasn't the first movie to depict a post-nuclear America, but The Day After was the first film to try to realistically depict the unspeakabledevastation of nuclear war.  The folks in this film were just normal civilians living normal lives in the heartland of America.  As such, the movie directly challenged everyone who thought \\"it can't happen here.\\"  No one is safe from the devastation of 100s of ICBMs exploding all over the country.  The Day After remains a powerful and important film today.  The threat of Soviet attack has been minimized (for now), but the threat of a nuclear attack is still very real, thanks to the madmen in Iran and North Korea and traitors to humanity such as Pakistan's Abdul Khan.  One well-placed nuclear detonation over the American continent could wipe out all power nationwide with its EMP pulse (and I was surprised and happy to see the EMP pulse effect mentioned in the movie) and instantly turn the U.S. into a third-world nation.  The worst thing we can do is to pretend the dangers of nuclear attack don't exist, and The Day After makes it all but impossible not to face up to that threat.  It is still very much required viewing, in my opinion.unspeakable devastation of nuclear war.  The folks in this film were just normal civilians living normal lives in the heartland of America.

B00024BHTC|5.0|The big problem with the one star reviewers (like Boston) is that they listen to american crap new metal bands sounding all the same with very little exceptions like System of a Down getting so many crap reviews from these narrow minded people . The worst thing is that american radio stations brainwash some people who think everything which tops the charts is gold.  It isn't. It is \\"fast food\\" music. It will be forgotten within a year. But these listeners cannot accept anything different and innovative.  Too bad for them!   Once is an absolute masterpiece from A to Z. Nightwish was one of the best metal bands in their style until they hired Anette. RIP!
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I think this was an amazing Cd.  The guitar riffs are very creative and different than what most bands are doing now. The vocals have improved since A7X's last record.  M. Shadows' voice has became more melodic and less screamo.
B0006L16N8|3.0|With this album, Coldplay has gone sad and melancholy,but not like their other 2 albums.  Some of the songs are good, but this album lacks the emotion of the 1st album.  The first album was much more energetic.  This one is more dry.
B000001FS3|5.0|U2 is one of my favourite bands. They play nice unwinding songs, types of songs you can listen to after a stressful day of work. <BR>One good thing about there music is that it is music that carries on through generations. It is not the kind of music that is popular on day and then fades into nowhere the next. This one day is going to be oldies music. Great Band, Great Music, so I give it a great review.
B0006L16N8|5.0|One of the best albums I've heard in years. For me, light years ahead of the first two Coldplay albums, mostly because the parts of those albums that dragged or were not melodic are now charged and filled with beautiful hooks. It's still early but right now this album reminds me very much of the Joshua Tree. Definitely worth your money.
B000089RVR|5.0|Dido's voice is very soothing and each and every song here is very enjoyable. If you appreciate good music buy this. It's music of a different kind than you're probably accustomed to hearing, but it takes very little time for you to begin to soak it up. It's just perfect when you want to unwind after work, or when you're sleeping. It's also a nice way of exploring your own feelings about love and self, and I am sure most of those who buy the album can identify with the words. This is one cd that will have pride of place on your shelf. To complete your collection, get No Angel by Dido also. It's another truly delightful album.
B0009A1AS2|2.0|I have been a DT fan since I&W's hit the airwaves in 93.  Since then I have followed the band through every studio and live album release and I must confess that this latest effort is very disappointing to me as was ToT.  Before I go into detail I will sum my feelings up by saying that DT is regressing instead of progressing.   <br /> <br />So why do I say that? Because veiled behind the amazing technical ability of the band members is the same recycled guitar riffs, instrumental passages, drum beats, and operatic vocals since SFAM.  Does anyone else notice that since Rudess joined the band their style has remained consistant and might I say quite boring?  It seems obvious that song structure is no longer a concern to DT and they feel quite content jamming to tape in the studio and then laying down uninspiring vocals over the music.  I am not sure why DT also feels the need to become so introspective and dark with their lyrics.  The mood of their lyrics seem so heavy but fail to be captavating at all.  <br /> <br />As you might tell I am a long time fan who is coming to the realization that the band I onced loved and respected is now losing my attention.  I know there are a lot of new fans who love DT's current music but for me songs such as \\"Caught in a Web\\" \\"Voices\\" \\"ACOS\\" \\"Lines in the Sand\\" and \\"Pull me Under\\" and even a few off SFAM and 6DOIT represent what I liked best about DT.  Songs that were accessible while maintaining a heavy, technical, and progressive element. <br /> <br />My suggestion to DT...lose Rudess and stop rehashing the same idea and get back to writing songs with some vibe and interest rather than instrumentals with vocals.  And to my guitar hero Petrucci...please get back to playing some tasteful leads rather than the same lighting fast triplet passages.
B0008KLVG4|5.0|I hope that the customers of Amazon.com can see past the issues of others and look at the real issue here: content of the DVD.<br /><br />This DVD is - at the moment - the definitive release of Jaws.  This movie is a classic, and finally got the DVD treatment it deserved.  This movie, with its soundtrack, caused an entire nation to be scared to go into the water.  Just admit it, you still get a little bit nervous when you're in the water and you can't see what lurks just beyond eyesight.<br /><br />This movie is great and looks even better on DVD.  Near perfect picture and sound.  Adequate bonus features.<br /><br />Don't listen to those complaining about the frequent re-releases.  If you've already got it, don't buy this one.  If you don't have it, buy it.  If your a big enough fan of the movie, it won't matter how much you spend on it.  Enjoy...and always swim with a buddy.  *cue Jaws theme song*
B00097A5I6|4.0|Can you imagine, 6 weeks ago I thought Meaning of Soul and Mucky Fingers were quite poor, repetitive, and 'whilst interesting will not hold up after a few listens'?! I now think they are sublime rockers that offer more masculinity than all of Coldplay's music put together. DBTT has grown on me for a few months and I can honestly say it is the most rewarding record I have heard in what feels like YEARS!    It must be said that in track 5, The Importance of Being Idle, Noel has once again hit the jackpot. Over the years he has slowly gone about writing a collection of material that really has few equals in today's rock world. This is another classic, that showcases how wonderful his compositions are, and how far the band have come since '94.    And that is why I feel this album deserves your time. The band started off with Definitely Maybe, speeding at 100 MPH, and once the press and the masterpiece of Morning Glory came along, they were going faster than a rocket. From obscurity to world domination the band were in an environment that allows for little growth. So sure enough they've made some mediocre records, made mistakes, but Noel is just 38, and Liam, now writing some wonderful songs, is 32. Neil Young is going to be 60 this year, Springsteen is 54, and Dylan is 64. All three of these legends are still going strong, still performing live, still evolving.    So what I'm saying is stop writing off Oasis, stop treating them differently to any other band or artist. Sure, their confidence is sometimes off putting, and whilst I love it many call them arrogant (fair enough). When you have however written Songbird, Stop Crying Your Heart Out, Little By Little, Lyla, The Importance of Being Idle, Guess God Thinks I'm Abel, Part of the Queue and Keep The Dream Alive in the past 5 years, then people who want to criticise should be quiet and start listening to the music properly.    Those first two records were part of an era and they will not return. Savour those records, they're classics. Heathen Chemistry and Don't Believe The Truth suggest Oasis are going through a transition, and I honestly believe sooner rather than later they will produce a classic that will silence the doubters once and for all.    This is my favourite album of the year, worthy of your attention, still vital, and still rock and roll. Thanks lads, and see you on the road.
B0006L16N8|5.0|This by far, was the best album they've made. I enjoyed every second of it, and i find myself wanting more. I recommend this to anyone who likes a cool beat, and a soft sound. My hats off to coldplay!
B00004XMS0|1.0|Because it sure as hell won't be for the movie themselves. The Last two movies are garbage. First two are golden. Just buy the first two and buy a ticket to Batman Begins.
B0007GAERG|4.0|I LOVE THIS CD. MARIAH SINGS HER HEART OUT ON THIS ALBUM. JOYRIDE IS MY FAVORITE SONG. MARIAH ALWAYS HAD A WAY OF MAKING HER VOICE SOUND UNIQUE ON ANY SONG; THAT'S WHY I LOVE HER SO MUCH. OTHER GREAT SONGS TO LOOK FOR IS CIRCLES, MINE AGAIN,  WE BELONG TOGETHER, I WISH YOU KNEW, AND YOUR GIRL. THE SONG WITH SNOOP DOGG IS ALSO GOOD. THIS CD HAS THAT OLD R&B SOUL FEEL THAT IS LACKING TODAY IN THIS MUSIC INDUSTRY. GO BUY THIS CD, MARIAH WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN!
B0006L16N8|5.0|After listening to nothing but this album for a week (and getting goose bumps every single time) there's simply one thing left to say...With X&Y Coldplay has proven its readiness to be U2's worthy successors atop the rock Mt Olympus. No need to go through the track listing...just buy the album already!!
B0007Y08QA|4.0|Just imagine Alfred Hitchcock, David Fincher and Christopher Nolan all collaborating on a movie and the result might be something like The Machinist. It's a dark, moody psychological mind-bender that had me riveted from the first minute to the last. In my opinion, The Machinist is certainly one of the best suspense thrillers of the last few years. In an era of tired, formula thrillers (e.g. most of Ashley Judd's filmography), Brad Anderson's The Machinist is a breath of fresh air: a deep, complex, layered film that could be deemed to be about any number of things. The story itself is certainly not the most original. As I mentioned earlier, it resembles work by Hitchcock (North By Northwest), David Fincher (The Game and Fight Club) and Christopher Nolan (Memento). That is no slight against the film, though. Brad Anderson and screenwriter Scott Kosar take these elements and weave them into a stunning whole that truly stands apart. The Machinist works best as a dark, twisted psychological experience in which the audience is brought into Trevor Reznik's (Christian Bale) disturbed state of mind. It is truly intense and  at times, frightening.    Of course, if you know anything about The Machinist, you probably know that Christian Bale lost a lot of weight to play the role of Trevor Reznik. By now, this fact should be pretty well known and there is really nothing more to say about it. Having just seen Christian Bale recently in American Psycho as well, I am truly impressed with him as an actor. He obviously devotes himself thoroughly to his performances even at the risk of his own health. I look forward to seeing Bale's take on Batman next.     If you are tired of bland Hollywood thrillers and are looking for something to give you a truly unique (if not necessarily pleasant) experience, I would highly recommend The Machinist. It is certainly not a movie for everyone though. A lot of people will find it disturbing and horrifying, and understandably so. It is a dark, twisted somewhat demented film. But if the words \\"dark\\", \\"twisted\\" and \\"demented\\" make you want to see a movie more than anything (like me), check out The Machinist as soon as possible.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I have always liked Coldplay but they have matured and their music shows it. Yes they are still geeky but that along with their maturity appears to translate to more enriched music. Hopefully the powers to be that determine what we listen to on radio and television don't decide this music is too intellectual for most listeners because many then will not get a chance to enjoy a truly good CD. Not a perfect CD (only a few of those exist) but it is something I wholly recommend.
B00092ZMDY|3.0|It's okay, but that's all. For most of us REAL Eagles fans from back in the day, it's nothing spectacular. The teeny boppers on the front row rudely standing in front of the older seated fans couldn't have POSSIBLY remembered anything from the 70's (kind of reminds me of a Heart concert I went to in '87...but I digress). <br /> <br />I saw the Eagles in Louisville on their North American Tour in 2002 and thought then what I thought now...I miss Don Felder. Steuart Smith tries, but he will NEVER be an Eagle-especially playing weak and looking like Lyle Lovett! <br /> <br />But all in all, it sounded okay, although not as good as their 2002 tour. And like someone else said...LOSE THE HORNS & FIDDLE! <br /> <br />
B00025ETIW|5.0|I first saw this group on VH1 singing I'm Not Okay.  I was immediately impressed and after a few weeks bought the CD, Three Cheers for Sweet Revenge.  They appear to be selling themselves as some sort of Gothic band, which could put a lot of people off, but believe me the music is excellent once you get into it. If necessary,you may have to ignore some of the morbid lyrics.  I love the lead singer's voice and think they are extremely talented.  I am inspired to workout to the music, jumping about like some sort of nut case on the treadmill, but it's great fun.  And yes, maybe I am weird just a little bit because I am a 56 year old grandma!
B000244EMO|5.0|Predator is arguably the most popular movie in the late '80's.  Director John McTiernan came up with inventive ways to keep the auidences tension alive in this now science fiction classic. <br /> <br />The plot is very simple, a group of commandos goes to the forest to rescue some people, but along the way are being hunted by an alien being.  That's it. <br /> <br />This was a very popular movie, because it was one of the first movies to have computer generation, good computer generation at that.  Arnold and Carl really save this movie acting wise, because all the rest of the actors, are just ok.  The script has a lot of corny one liners that have now become famous such as, \\"If it bleeds, we can kill it.\\" \\"That's a real nasty habbit you got there.\\" \\"...Makes Cambodia look like Kasas.\\"  and who could ever forget, \\"You're one ugly mother****er.\\" <br /> <br />The special features are top notch compared to the last edition, because the last edition only had a trialer on it, which is not included in this edition.  This edition features a full length audio commentary with Director John McTiernan, a making of featurette, and lots more. <br /> <br />This is not a movie if you're studying films for it's dialouge and story.  This is just a milestone in film which is a very entertaining and frieghtening hour and forty minutes. <br /> <br />See it, you won't be sorry that you did.
B000094A6B|5.0|In 1978, a film was released called \\"National Lampoon's Animal House\\". The film was a hysterical look at a group of fraternity buddies at college out looking for a good time. The film made a legend out of then \\"Saturday Night Live\\" castmember John Belushi and became a comedy classic.<br /><br />25 years after the release of \\"Animal House\\" came \\"Old School\\". Well, ladies and gentleman, you finally have the 21st century version of \\"Animal House\\". I mean seriously, consider the facts: both films have to do with old college buddies out to for a good time, and both feature showstopping performances by \\"Saturday Night Live\\" cast members (Will Ferrell is so funny in this film).<br /><br />Mitch Mitchell (Luke Wilson) is a successful bsinessman with a beautiful home and an equally beautiful girlfriend (Juliette Lewis). But things soon come crashing down when he realizes that his girlfriend is cheating on him. Distraught, he moves out and seeks sollace from his friends Beanie (Vince Vaughn) and the newly married, ex - party boy Frank \\"The Tank\\" Ricard (Will Ferrell, playing the Bluto of this film). Their plan: to turn Mitch's new home into a college fraternity, where kids can enjoy loud music, alcohol and hot women galore. The plan becomes a huge success - until dean Prichard (Jeremy Piven, who is hysterical) intervenes, saying that Mitch's house is college property and he must move out. What ensues is an all out war to keep their beloved frat and the good times rolling.<br /><br />\\"Old School\\" is chock full of hilarious and unforgetttable moments, including the opening scene where Mitch realizes his girlfriend is cheating on him, a KY jelly show that goes horribly wrong, and Frank getting shot in the neck with a dart. But none are more funnier when Will Ferrell takes of his clothes and begins streaking. The best part is when his wife catches him, forces him to get in the car and go home, when Will all of a sudden spits out, \\"Do you think KFC is still open?\\"<br /><br />In addition to its strong main cast, it also features some great supporting roles and cameos by Elisha Cuthbert (Jack Bauer's daughter on the first three seasons of \\"24\\"), Snoop Dogg, Seann William Scott (Stifler from \\"American Pie\\"), and most hilariously, Andy Dick (I can't really go into detail about the latter's part).<br /><br />I haven't watched all the extras, but I can tell you that the \\"Inside The Actors Studio\\" spoof is definitely worth the price of this dvd. \\"Old School\\" is a great film for everyone who enjoys fine Americsn comedy (and especially \\"Animal House\\" fans)., it also features some great supporting roles and cameos by Elisha Cuthbert (Jack Bauer's daughter on the first three seasons of \\"24\\"), Snoop Dogg, Seann William Scott (Stifler from \\"American Pie\\"), and most hilariously, Andy Dick (I can't really go into detail about the latter's part).

B00008WT5M|5.0|The Razor's Edge might be the best AC/DC album since Back in Black. For Those About To Rock, Flick of the Switch, Fly on the Wall, and Blow up your Video were great but AC/DC hadn't put out a truly classic rock album in almost a decade. Thunderstruck and Moneytalks are two of their best songs and Are You Ready, Got You By the Balls, and Rock Your Heart Out are great too. Brian sounds better than usual and Angus opening solo for Thunderstruck is possibly one of the best openers ever. This is a cd that more than AC/DC fans will love and I hope it gets the credit it deserves.
0735619670|4.0|This book contains a lot of advice which I'd file under 'common sense' (varying from limiting the number of nested loops to using good variable names and from not copy-pasting to writing proper comments), but given the fact that I work with code which makes just about every mistake listed in the book, perhaps this classification is a bit hasty. This type of information is nothing you couldn't get out of discussions with other programmers, websites, etc., but having it centralized in a book is useful. <br /> <br />I like the use of 'hard data', concrete numbers from scientific research, used to turn qualitative speculation into an informed opinion. E.g. where different defect reduction/prevention strategies are discussed, data is presented which makes it clear what you can expect from say unit testing compared to code reviews. <br /> <br />The examples used are mainly C++, Java and VB (with occasional side-steps in other languages), but they're easy to follow even if you're not familiar with the language in question. <br /> <br />The book itself is also of high quality, with a good structure, key points, useful references, etc. <br /> <br />One of its minor points is that at times it gives you some interesting info and then leaves you hanging (e.g. the discussion of formal code reviews is quite short), while other, simpler concepts, are driven home over several pages (e.g. good variable names). <br /> <br />Another thing I didn't appreciate is the use of a few American comparisons and references. I presume the book is written for an international audience, in which case such culture-specific idioms should be avoided. The Pontiac Aztek is featured quite prominently (never having seen one, nor being aware of its reputation, I have no idea whether the choice for that particular car has any meaning, be it positive or negative). I also remember at least one reference to some sports terminology which is obsure to most non-Americans, probably baseball-related. <br /> <br />My last gripe is that while the book uses a light tone and is at times entertaining, at other times the humor is not particularly funny and is stretched out a bit too long (e.g. a fictitious discussing between archetypical types of programmers). <br /> <br />All in all I find the book a useful, well-written en well researched resource. Only four stars due to the superficial discussion of some interesting topics and the Pontiac Aztek references.
B000002LPD|4.0|Van Halen's ninth album out of all of their albums and their third album with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals,\\"For Unlwaful Carnal Knowledge\\",is a great album. I'm a die hard VH fan,and even though I'm a bigger fan of their era with David Lee Roth on lead vocals then I am a fan of their era with Sammy Hagar on vocals,I have enjoyed the contributions Hagar has had to the group. When Roth was their lead singer,the songs were fun and juvenile,and when Hagar was with the group,even though Van Halen had some juvenile songs with Hagar on vocals,for the most part,once Hagar was with the group,the songs became more mature and good but not as fun and rocking as the Van Halen era with David Lee Roth was. With the exceptions of \\"Poundcake\\" and \\"Spanked\\",this album showed that Van Halen was really starting to mature;however,this album still rocks. The producer of this album,Andy Johns,had also produced some Led Zeppelin albums,so if you put every Zeppelin album in a blender with \\"Diver Down\\"(their fourth album which featured DLR on lead vocals),\\"0U812\\"(their eighth album out of all of their albums and the second album they had with Sammy Hagar on lead vocals),and every song from the 80's/90's hair metal group Slaughter(hence,the song \\"Up All Night\\"(Sleep All Day)that is reminiscient of Zeppelin(FLY TO THE ANGELS,DO YA KNOW,BREAKDOWN 'N CRY,HEAVEN IT CRIES,and HEADIN' FOR A DREAM)then this album would be the result. The opening song,\\"Poundcake\\",is fun,juvenile,raunchy and a cross between Warrant's \\"Cherry Pie\\" song and Def Leppard's classic \\"Pour Some Sugar On Me\\". The other highlights here are \\"Runaround\\",\\"In 'n Out\\",\\"Right Now\\",the beautiful instrumental \\"316\\"(which Eddie Van Halen wrote for his son Wolfgang that he had with Valerie Bertinelli)and the closing song,\\"Top Of The World\\",which is a really nice and cool song. Bottom Line:All die hard David Lee Roth fans need to stay far away from this record as possible,but all Van Halen fans who are loyal VH fans with either David Lee Roth or Sammy Hagar need to give this album a listen.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|Its impossible not to love this movie.It has Zombies, romance, scares and even a tear or two. Its without a doubt the best movie to come out of the UK in the last five years. <br /> <br />Simon Pegg is wonderful as Shaun, the ultimate everyman with his sidekick Nick Frost as Ed. The rest of the cast are wonderful and a veritable whos who of British comedy, with Lucy Davis from the smash hit \\"The Office\\" and utterly fabulous Dylan Moran who is perhaps one of the greatest Irish standup comics ever. <br /> <br />The film was not what I was expecting at all. I was expecting a kind of typical spoof on all levels, with lots of \\"in jokes\\" for people who love Zombie movies. But that isnt what I got at all. It actually had a plot. A good one at that. You feel for these characters, especially Shaun who has to see more than a few of his loved ones fall prey to the flesh eating followers. I was choked up at the scenes with his mother and the goodbye to Ed in the cellar. There is genuine tension created with the character David, proving Dylan Morans wonderful range as a dramatic actor.  As a result this film has just as much credibilty, if not more, than the recent remake of Dawn of the Dead.  <br /> <br />On the extras front, this is a perfect example of how to produce a real dvd. The wealth of commentaries (on the uk release) is wonderful. I love commentaries and loved the group one with all the principle characters together clearly enjoying each other company and, it would seem, getting a little drunk (at least on Dylans part) <br /> <br />I love this movie, mainly for the fact that it suprised me. It was wonderfully funny but also tugged at the heartstrings and had the odd scare here and there. A perfect movie. <br />
B000001FQQ|4.0|KISS' \\"Hot In The Shade\\" album,which was released in October of 1989 and was their last album that was released in the 80's,is a pretty good album.I'll sum it up this way:it is a good album,but it is really different from \\"Lick It Up\\",\\"Animalize\\",\\"Asylum\\",and \\"Crazy Nights\\". The opening track is \\"Rise To It\\",which is an intersting song. The lyrics are sung from the point of view of a guy who wants payback towards his \\"snobby\\" ex-wife/girlfriend-what's so interesting about the lyrics of this song is that the video for this song showed Gene Simmons and Paul Stanley putting on their make-up backstage at a KISS concert and talking about the future of the band-so when Paul Stanley wrote this track with Bob Halligan,I wonder what he and Gene Simmons had on their minds(I remember reading once that there was supposed to be a KISS reunion tour in 1989 that would feature Gene Simmons,Paul Stanley,Ace Frehley,and Eric Carr and that Simmons,Stanley,Frehley,and Carr were going to put back on their makeup and costumes). I wonder what happened. <br /> <br />The rest of this album,while it is not outstanding,is pretty good. It spawned the hit power ballad \\"Forever\\",which was written by BOTH Paul Stanley AND Michael Bolton,and this album also has the original KISS song from their 80's era that Eric Carr(RIP)sang(note that KISS re-recorded \\"Beth\\" with Carr on lead vocals for their \\"Smashes,Thrashes,and Hits\\" greatest hits package that was released in Nvember of 1988). That song(the song on this album)is \\"Little Caesar\\",which is a really cool tune-it kind of reminds me of the things I've heard about Carr's unreleased cartoon show,\\"The Rockheads\\".Everything else here,while it is not earth shattering,is really good and really different-\\"Hide Your Heart\\" is about fights over love between teenagers(it may seem hard to understand after You've listened to the lyrics of the song,but if You've seen the video for that song on KISS' \\"Extreme Closeup\\" video than You'll understand the concept ofthe song).\\"Betrayed\\" is about being betrayed and following \\"the law of the jungle\\" when You're out on your own,and I won't give away everything,but \\"Somewhere Between Heaven and Hell\\"is sung from the point of view from a guy(believe it or not,this is a Gene Simmons song)who has his heart broken because his girlfriend will not have sex with him. Very interesting. <br /> <br />Overall,while this is not a great album,it is pretty good,and it is just really different. It was the last KISS album that Eric Carr would perform on(Carr died of heart cancer in November 1991)and out of all of the KISS albums of the 80's following \\"Lick It Up\\",this was where everyone in the band kind of gave it a 100 percent-Gene Simmons had been acting in movies and was not available to complete half of \\"Animalize\\" and \\"Asylum\\",and he co-wrote more tracks on this then he did on \\"Crazy Nights\\". So,considering all of those facts,it is really interesting to see how this album turned out,especially since this was the last album that Vini Poncia(the producer of Dynasty,Unmasked,Peter Criss' self-titled 1978 solo album,among some of Criss' other solo albums)co-wrote some songs on this record,although he did not produce it. <br /> <br />An interesting album-especially for a KISS record.
B0009KA7BS|5.0|This movie really suprised me. Granted i never read the source material but im happy i didnt because i really enjoyed this an occult noir movie remind me of \\"Angel Heart.\\" The cinematography was beautiful and the effects were extremely well done. There was also a large variety of colorful character. And who doesnt love religious mumbo jumbo.
B00080ZG10|1.0|Wow... What a waste of good acting - and of three hours.  This movie has an incredible cast - Leo DiCaprio, Alec Baldwin, Ian Holm, Cate Blanchett, Jude Law, etc. etc., and some very fine acting from Mr. DiCaprio, but wow... what a let-down.  The first hour was great - I LOVE Cate Blanchett as Katherine Hepburn, but as Howard Hughes' mental state starts to decline, so does the movie.  The middle, until the last half hour of the movie (the movie being 170 minutes) just drags ON and ON, with explicit scenes of Hughes just going nuts.  I just didn't see the point besides that a great man was destroyed by obsessive compulsive disorder.  I was bored and weirded out.  Sorry.

B000002JKA|5.0|Dream Theater like its name is a unreal dream, every second of a Dream Theater song is not of this world. Dream Theater is the complete expresion of the art (music). AWAKE is pure progresive metal, a bit more heavy than IMAGES AND WORDS but show the quality of this great band. Mike Portnoy lives for the drums. There is no words to describe this band. Every time I listen Dream Theater I find new emotions and feelings. <br /> <br />Thanks Dream Theater!
B000002J09|5.0|85 Delorean is an unhappy lonely thing. If you're buying a  <br />Led Zeppelin cd for yourself or someone else and undecided, this is the one.  Yes it boils down to personal preference, trust me who is a lover of all types of music, this compilation of music set precedent to many who followed in the music industry. It's great to hear the marketing department for Caddilac choose the song \\"Rock 'n Roll\\" for their theme song. <br />Buy it.
B00005B58Y|5.0|Milestones is a transitional recording . Sandwiched betweeen Round ABout Midnight and Kind Of Blue, it features Miles with Coltrane and Cannonball just before Miles' move to a pure modal approach on Kind Of Blue. For me the title tune is a stunner and it has become something of a jazz anthem for good reason. The contrast between Adderly's melodic playing, Coltrane's harsher approach and the perfectly understated trumpet of Miles Davis is one of those moments in musical history that make you shake your head in wonder. The treatment given Monk's Straight No Chaser is fantastic. This is right up there as one of my favorite Miles recordings.
B00005JNEI|1.0|Moore uses his first amendment rights to give his shortsighted and narrow opinion. Most of the film can be seen as a total contrivance. My 7 year old son asked me if Michael Moore was really serious or was he making a comedy that everyone should laugh at. Unfortunately I had to tell him that Michael Moore was not intelligent enough to know the difference and was quite serious in what he was doing.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|Finally the members of Dream Theater left their precious egos at home (even Portnoy!) and just made music. Stellar compositons, both lyrically as well as musically, with a progrock mixture that's approachable, modernistic (\\"Never Enough\\" is a clear high-speed Muse) and yet classic (\\"Octavarium\\" reminisces to Genesis and Pink Floyd)... There is a clear influence of Rudess on this one (which is a nice refreshment after last's album bombastic testostoron display of Petrucci/Portnoy's \\"how many notes a second can I play\\")<br /><br />For those that like shredding this album will be a disappointment, but for those sheer lovers of progrock: it's party time! After 20 years of music this is a mature album and a fine follow-up of \\"6 Degrees of Inner Turbulence\\" (as ToT was only to proof they didn't lose their roots and had little to do with music as such -- yet I liked it a lot)...<br /><br />Although what I miss on this album it that edge that makes Dream Theater Dream Theater, what sets them apart from all others (hence 4 stars instead of 5), but even without their egos they still proof they're the absolute summon of prog!
B00070Q7VO|5.0|What a phenomenal singer. This guy is pure magic!!!!! <br />To cover each and every song with such positive energy and life is an inspiration to those of us who enjoy good music. <br />Highlights are Home, Save the last Dance and Quando Quando. <br /> <br />Can't buy me love would make the Beatles proud and You and I moved me beyond words. <br /> <br />Try it, buy it and you will be uplifted with each play..........
B00005A46T|5.0|did you ever stop to think that some people dont listen to metal to be impressed by guitar solos or just to say they listen to the best of it... sorry... this wont sound like metallica, in flames, or slayer... this is slipknot. the first metal band that i called my favorite so long ago. iawa in my opinion their best cd for one reason, the same reason that makes slipknot so different from everyone else in the first place in the form of 1 man, corey talor. corey talor brings about such a feeling of pure desperate hatred, enough off it to give iowa a power of its own. the drumming is not exactly original or inovative but fast none the less on nearly every song. and yes, its true, not only are there no sollos, the guitar is so week and pathetic, like its not even there. nevertheless, if you enjoy metal because of the anger and suffering you feel from listening to the vocals than corey talor will not fail to do just that... but if you listen to metal because you are awed by the instrumental geneous and intensity of the metal genre itself than slipknot is not for you... you will hear no such talent promoted by these guys... for that you should definitely check out vol. 3 the subliminal version. even then you still may not be thoroughly impressed... after all these years i still go back to iowa, not to be stunned by the music itself, but because of the feeling corey talors vocals of exquisit anguish bring me... and that alone is the originality of slipknot, never have i heard a voice like coreys before. i have to say, slipknot is definitely the best nu metal band i have ever heard... nu metal being the music complimenting the voice wrather than the voice complimenting the music. so dont judge this iowa on what it isnt, judge it compared to other nu metal bands... as i have, im sure you will find that slipknot is ruler of them all. \\"stay sic maggots\\"
B0007MVXQG|5.0|Judas Priest's comeback album finds them picking up about where they left off in the `80's. \\"Angel of Retribution\\" has as much energy and integrity that Priest had when Rob Halford left in 1990. Thus, when I listen to this C.D., I sometimes forget what year it is- and that Rob is 54 years old! He is the third oldest man who is still playing heavy metal (Lemmy Kilmister of Motorhead is the first oldest, and Ozzy's second.)  <br />  <br />Some people (some very ignorant people) say that some of Priest's new songs sound too similar to \\"British Steel\\" and \\"Screaming for Vengeance.\\" Let me defend this statement. First of all, if you like the sound, what are you complaining about? Next, the original singer rejoined the group, so of course the new material is going to be similar to what it sounded like before. This is a return to form! Finally, at least Judas Priest didn't \\"modernize their sound\\" for this album. Some criticize Metallica and Slayer for doing this, but there's no way this group did. <br />  <br />At ten tracks, one might think this is a fairly short C.D., fortunately, at 52 minutes, it is not. There aren't as many high pitched yells here as there were when Rob was in his prime, but there are as many vocal hooks, Megadeth-esque guitar solos, and songs that are about devils, demons, and Hell. I guess you're never too old to hail Satan.   <br />  <br />Highlights include: <br />  <br />\\"Judas Rising\\" deserves to be the first single. The opening riff fades in and gains in volume, then things take off when the drums begin. I enjoy how the verses of this song build, then the music pauses for the very catchy choruses. The song is rounded off by two guitar solos. <br />\\"Deal with the Devil\\" features a speedy, running and chugging riff and a great guitar solo (around the 2:20 mark), which has several different parts to it. I don't mean to sound cheesy, but guitarist Glenn Tipton must have made a \\"deal with the Devil,\\" so he could sound this good. <br />Things slow down a bit during \\"Worth Fighting For\\" (which features soft singing and only and occasional riff), but they pick back up again for the very next track, \\"Demonizer.\\" It has a fast opening riff and fast-but not pummeling-double bass work by the drummer (Scott Travis). The riff then turns to a fast chug, and another wailing guitar solo (which keeps up with the pace of the song's beat) is included, as are a couple of Rob's high-pitched squeals (when he says \\"demonizer\\"). <br />\\"Wheels of Fire\\" has a slower (but still pretty fast) riff and a couple more (albeit brief) guitar solos. It is quite repetitive, both musically and lyrically, but even this song gets stuck in my head. <br />\\"Lochness\\" is 12 minutes long, but it otherwise begins as a continuation of track nine, \\"Eulogy.\\" It begins very slowly, with distant guitar noise. Then the drums kick in and the guitars come to the forefront. The next minute is a staccato riff, followed by a very brief chug and one last good guitar solo. Then things slow way down, but even at its fastest, \\"Lochness\\" is only about half the speed as most of the other songs. The C.D. ends with some wah-wah guitar noise, and a couple of crunchy riffs.  <br />  <br />The only flaw \\"Angel of Retribution\\" has is about all of its fast songs are the same speed. That's certainly not a fatal flaw, however. It's just the niche this band has created; it's part of what they're famous for. Plus, not all of the songs are fast. Tracks 4, 7 and 9 are all slow songs, almost power ballads, and (as aforementioned), track ten is half-speed as the fast songs.   <br />  <br />You might be wondering why I call this a comeback. Well, even though Priest have been making music all this time (even with Rob gone), almost no one wanted to hear any of it. So, now that Rob's back, Judas Priest-who are in top form, here-have made possibly the year's best C.D., and definitely the comeback of the year. The bottom line is this is a great album, any metalhead should pick it up, andthe bonus disc makes a great inclusion to any Priest collection. Is \\"Judas rising?\\" No, Judas has risen.
B00000I8BX|4.0|i bought this obsolete not long ago along with a couple other cds i found at cheep prices on this site. not instantly being impressed with this cd i set it aside. about a week later i found a couple songs that especially enjoyed like the first and favorite track:\\"shock\\" the heaviest on the album: \\"concreto\\" and the longest song: \\"resurrection\\". now i enjoy pretty much every song except the anoying \\"cars\\" the creepy bonus track \\"0-0 were evil dwells\\". its awesome how a lot of songs have cool intros and escelate to a shout along chorus near the end(title of review) its also pretty awesome how the flow of the music seems almost mechanical, the bass and drums are very precise, almost like a machine. but unlike other fear factory cds, this one will take some time before it finally grows on you. i would definite consider this cd to anyone interested in industrial heavy metal, AFTER BUYING ARCHYTYPE OR DEMANUFACTURE since those are better by comparison. this though is what i would consider a classic from one of the best industrial metal bands to ever walk the face of the earth!
B000002MJC|5.0|Violator made me a DM fan, although I had certainly heard of them since people are people in 1984.  Enjoy the Silence got me hooked and I expected another album like Violator when DM returned to the scene in 1993.  At first I didn't like this album and frankly the style change and even Dave's new look confused me.  Songs of Faith and Devotion grew on me and looking back 12 years, the album was amazing then and still is a solid release today.  Lyrcially speaking, Gore produced probably his most poetic songs.  Dave vocals were escpecially good.  The only thing is that the bad was having relationship and drug troubles and that might be the reason that there are some things to the ablum that doesn't work.  That being said, this album was better than most that were released in 1993.  Here are the songs: <br /> <br />1.  I Feel You (10/10) Powerful! Wow!  The video for this song was perfect and this was the best song to open the album up. <br />2.  Walking in My Shoes (10/10) One of DM's best songs.  Deep and thought provactive....this song has made many non DM fans a true addict. <br />3.  Condemnation (8/10) The only problem with this song is Dave's vocals.  There are only two songs in the entire DM cataloge where his vocals could have been better and this is one of them.  Martin's lyrics in this song are some of his best.  How many song writers of today would dare make a single of a song like this one?  DM's brialliance really comes through! <br />4.  Mery in You (9/10)  Great song!  The guitar loop is perfect hear and Dave's voice transcends the complex atmospheric keyboard arrangements of this song.  Play this one again and again. <br />5.  Judas (9/10) Martin's first song on this album where he is the singer follows many intense songs of faith and devotion.  What DM does best in music is perfectly illustrated in this song where deep lyrics meet meditational music.  This song will hook you from opening to end. <br />6.  In Your Room (10/10)  This song is POWERFUL!  Wow!  I love hearing it live and everytime I play this song on my stereo, I have to turn it up.  Dave's tortured voice perfectly conveys the emotions of the song.  DM at its best! <br />7.  Get Right With Me (7/10)  This is the weakest song on the album and it really doesn't fit.  That being said its not a bad song it just needed a little more work.  The outro is a good intro into the next song. <br />8.  Rush (9/10) Quite a song and it should have been a single.  Martin's guitar work is impressive here and Alan Wilder's drums make it a fast track.  The live versions of this song are also quite good. <br />9.  One Caress (9/10) This song was a gamble that worked!  I say that it was a gamble because it broke the flow and style that dominates the album.  There isn't one keyboard used in the song but rather an entire orchestral session backed up by Martin Gore's best vocal performance by far.  I played this song to a friend of mine who hates DM and this song made him a fan.   <br />10.  Higher Love (10/10) This is my favorite track on the album because I feel this is how the album was supposed to end up.  This song is perfectly written, sund, mixed and edited.  Not to mention the fact that the lyrics are amazing!  Read the lyrics while you listen to the music and it will send you to a world of bliss.   <br /> <br />Songs of Faith and Devotion is one of DM's best albums and certainly was also one of the best albums of  the 1990's.  It was also the first alternative album to open at number 1 on both sides of the Atlantic.  Quite an accomplishment. <br /> <br />
B00005JM4Z|5.0|I love this movie. It will have you out of your seat every minute. I like japanese cars and street racing, so this movie is perfect for me. And this movie has my 3 favorite cars, the Nissan Skyline, Toyota Supra, and Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution. There are also Honda S2000, Mitsubishi Eclipse, Mazda RX-7, and a lot of other good cars. This movie has better acting than the first one. Tyrese actually makes the movie a little funny.
0792833201|4.0|For those people giving it less than 4 stars: maybe you just had to grow up on these types of movies, or maybe you just don't \\"get it\\". Obviously, by today's standards it's a little cheesy, but when it came out, it was pretty creepy. Just think of losing your child into the spirit world and battling to get them back. The dated FX in this movie where also way ahead of its time. Also, if anyone gets a chance, catch the documentary about this movie (or research the history on it) the events that happened around this movie are more strange than the movie itself. I think I seen the documentary on VH1 or something.
B0000C8AVI|4.0|Dylan's career epitomizes change. He has buffeted and tossed fans around on a wild sea of change and reinvention since 1965 (when he picked up an electric guitar in defiance of the folk community's unwritten rules). The year 1979 saw his most shocking transition. One that challenged and threatened Dylan's career like no other. Dylan began espousing Christianity and throwing around the term \\"born again\\". Jerry Wexler, who produced \\"Slow Train Coming\\", told Dylan biographer Clinton Heylin that \\"I had no idea he was on this born-again Christian trip until he started to evangelize me.\\" Wexler diplomatically told Dylan to back off, but he produced the album anyway. So in the heyday of punk the performer many people associated, fairly or unfairly, with 1960s \\"radicalism\\" turned explicitly Christian. Not only that, 1978's \\"Street Legal\\" met with an extremely icy reception. For many fans Dylan's new \\"phase\\" was too much.<br /><br />Dylan's \\"Christian phase\\" (though arguably not a phase) now looks somewhat innocuous from a historical perspective. After two (some say one, some say three) more \\"Christian\\" albums, Dylan's lyrics morphed once again. Would his career have survived had he plunged permanently into Christian music? Hard to say. Many thought he was through in 1965. He may have simply found a different audience (though in the 1970s that audience would probably have been a small one). Regardless, the 1980s were probably the low point of Dylan's career from many perspectives.<br /><br />\\"Slow Train Coming\\" is a Christian album. It makes no apologies for this. Though far less preachy than its successor, \\"Saved\\", the theme of the album remains unmistakable. \\"When He Returns\\", the album's passionate closer, more than demonstrates this with lines such as \\"He's got plans of his own to set up His throne when He returns\\".<br /><br />Whether or not listeners accept this album most likely depends on their attitude towards the lyrics. Because there's nothing wrong with the music on \\"Slow Train Coming\\". \\"Gotta Serve Somebody\\" grooves in a way that Dylan had never really grooved previously. \\"Precious Angel\\" features Mark Knoplfer's distinctive guitar style and probably one of the best Dylan drawls ever recorded: \\"Ya know I just couldn't make it by myself. I'm a little too blind to seeeEEEeeeeee.\\" \\"Slow Train\\" contains an ominous groove. \\"When you Gonna Wake Up\\" lashes out at society's failings.

B000001F3C|4.0|This CD is a must own for any U2 fan. It is the band's third full-length release, and I must say, it is definetely one of their best CDs. This album, like all of their albums that were released in the 80's, is much better than the band's CDs that were released in the 90's. The CD opens up strong with \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" (if you haven't heard that track yet, then shame on you) and ends strong with \\"'40'\\". It gets a four out of five because it is too short, and they could've thrown at least one more track onto it (and I think that would have made the album even better).
B0007N1AI6|5.0|Judas Priest's comeback album finds them picking up about where they left off in the `80's. \\"Angel of Retribution\\" has as much energy and intensity that Priest had when Rob Halford left in 1990. Thus, when I listen to this C.D., I sometimes forget what year it is- and that Rob is 54 years old! He is the third oldest man who is still playing heavy metal (Lemmy Kilmister of Motorhead is the first oldest, and Ozzy's second.)<br /><br />Some people (some very ignorant people) say that some of Priest's new songs sound too similar to \\"British Steel\\" and \\"Screaming for Vengeance.\\" Let me defend this statement. First of all, if you like the sound, what are you complaining about? Next, the original singer rejoined the group, so of course the new material is going to be similar to what it sounded like before he left. This is a return to form! Finally, at least Judas Priest didn't \\"modernize their sound\\" for this album. Some criticize Metallica and Slayer for doing this, but there's no way this group did.<br /><br />At ten tracks, one might think this is a fairly short C.D., fortunately, at 52 minutes, it is not. There aren't as many high pitched yells here as there were when Rob was in his prime, but there are as many vocal hooks, Megadeth-esque guitar solos, and songs that are about devils, demons, and Hell. I guess you're never too old to hail Satan.<br /><br />Highlights include:<br /><br />\\"Judas Rising\\" deserves to be the first single. The opening riff fades in and gains in volume, then things take off when the drums begin. I enjoy how the verses of this song build, then the music pauses for the very catchy choruses. The song is rounded off by two guitar solos.<br />\\"Deal with the Devil\\" features a speedy, running and chugging riff and a great guitar solo (around the 2:20 mark), which has several different parts to it. I don't mean to sound cheesy, but guitarist Glenn Tipton must have made a \\"deal with the Devil,\\" so he could sound this good.<br />Things slow down a bit during \\"Worth Fighting For\\" (which features soft singing and only and occasional riff), but they pick back up again for the very next track, \\"Demonizer.\\" It has a fast opening riff and fast-but not pummeling-double bass work by the drummer (Scott Travis). The riff then turns to a fast chug, and another wailing guitar solo (which keeps up with the pace of the song's beat) is included, as are a couple of Rob's high-pitched squeals (when he says \\"demonizer\\").<br />\\"Wheels of Fire\\" has a slower (but still pretty fast) riff and a couple more (albeit brief) guitar solos. It is quite repetitive, both musically and lyrically, but even this song gets stuck in my head.<br />\\"Lochness\\" is 12 minutes long, but it otherwise begins as a continuation of track nine, \\"Eulogy.\\" It begins very slowly, with distant guitar noise. Then the drums kick in and the guitars come to the front. The next minute is a staccato riff, followed by a very brief chug and one last good guitar solo. Then things slow way down, but even at its fastest, \\"Lochness\\" is only about half the speed as most of the other songs. The C.D. ends with some wah-wah guitar noise, and a couple of crunchy riffs.<br /><br />The only flaw \\"Angel of Retribution\\" has is about all of its fast songs are the same speed. That's certainly not a fatal flaw, however. It's just the niche this band has created, it's part of what Priest are famous for. Plus, not all of the songs are fast. Tracks 4, 7 and 9 are all slow songs, almost power ballads, and (as aforementioned) track ten is half the speed as the fast songs.<br /><br />You might be wondering why I call this a comeback. Well, even though Priest have been making music all this time (even with Rob gone), almost no one wanted to hear any of it. But, now that Rob's back, Judas Priest (who are in top form here) have made possibly the year's best C.D., and definitely the comeback album of the year.<br /><br />The bottom line is this is a great album, one that is so exciting and has somuch great musicianship, it's on par with the classics \\"British Steel\\" and \\"Screaming for Vengence.\\" Any metalhead should pick \\"Angel of Retribution\\" up, and the live DVD (or the bonus C.D., if you get the Dual Disc package) would make a great inclusion to any Priest collection.<br /><br />Is \\"Judas rising?\\" No. Judas has risen.teel\\" and \\"Screaming for Vengence.\\" Any metalhead should pick \\"Angel of Retribution\\" up, and the live DVD (or the bonus C.D., if you get the Dual Disc package) would make a great inclusion to any Priest collection.     Is \\"Judas rising?\\" No. Judas has risen.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Yes, \\"X&Y\\" is greater than AROBTTH. The music is gigantic. \\"X&Y\\" can proudly stand amongst the tallest giants in any forest on any mountain. This is a classic. Coldplay could write a textbook on how to make great songs and great sounds. Their music is so stimulating, yet so elegant. \\"X&Y clearly came from the hands of master craftsmen, not amateurs. The student has finally risen to the level of the teacher. They are ready to instruct their own class. Bravo. A+ with honors.
B0006L16N8|4.0|This is a CD that you need to listen to several times before it really grows on you, with that being said if you are expecting the Coldplay of the first two CDs this is not it! Don't let the song Speed of Sound fool you it is the only track that sounds remotely like the Coldplay of old.  Perhaps the greatest song on the CD is Fix You, I compare it to Trouble from their first CD.  What I don't like about this CD is it is overall a very slow tempo piece of work compared to their others, I also miss on this CD the explosion their sound normally makes, you can feel it build on this CD but they seem to pull themselves back.  Overall if you are a Coldplay fan you will enjoy, but I really don't believe they will make a lot of new fans with this CD, I find it interesting that I really enjoy the tracks when they play them live outside of this studio recording because they seem to spring to life a bit more.  For me as an American who is a huge British music fan this concludes a 3 week new release run that included the Gorillazs, Oasis and Coldplay, my recap would be Gorillaz first, Coldplay second and Oasis coming in at number 100 or better said off of the chart [the CD sucks]and that pains me as an Oasis fan.
B0001W8Q9Y|5.0|This band is without a doubt the most underrated band in the music industry.  My impression is that this a theme CD of someone who is in heartache over a woman lost interspersed with images of going back to the simpler times of his childhood. The final track (my favorite) - Neverland - is musically rich, melancholy, and powerful. <br /> <br />What a great, great CD.
B0006L16N8|5.0|If perfect did exist, there would be room for Coldplay in that definition. Their latest effort, X&Y, is as close to perfect as it gets. Most won't be able to match Coldplay's skill and depth. X&Y merely illustrates why they deserve to be standing on a higher plateau.  <br /> <br />Square One 10/10 <br />What If 10/10 <br />White Shadows 10/10 <br />Fix You 10/10 <br />Talk 10/10 <br />X&Y 9/10 <br />Speed of Sound 10/10 <br />A Message 9/10 <br />Low 10/10 <br />The Hardest Part 10/10 <br />Swallowed by the Sea 9/10 <br />Twisted Logic 10/10 <br />Till Kingdom Come 9/10 <br />
B000000W6F|4.0|Back in 91 this album represented the vanguard of alternative rock before such a thing existed.  SP were part of a group of new bands trying to push the boundaries (along with Nirvana, Alice In Chains, Sonic Youth, Jane's Addiction, Faith No More, Dinosaur Jr., Soundgarden, et al).  I had this back in 91 and was struck by how similiar I thought it sounded to Jane's Addiction.  Since I was in mourning over Jane's breakup, I ate this up (I even saw SP tour to support this album - in between Pearl Jam and Red Hot Chili Peppers in Oct 91!!).  Anyway, while this album has a lot of great songs, fans of Siamese Dream may be surprised by some of Gish's more psychadelic leanings.  It's a good album, but listening to it 15 years later, I realize that it loses steam and focus on the second half.  Nonetheless, it'll always hold a place in my heart (props to the reviewer from Ontario who nailed high school in the early 90s on the head).
B00082IJ08|5.0|Like the subject says, if you are looking for more of the same from the Gorillaz you may be disappointed.  If you actually listen the the album a few times before dismissing it as not being the \\"old Gorillaz\\" you may come to like it even more than the first.<br /><br />It is just as funky and fresh as the original, but it seems like quite a few people want the stale old Gorillaz.  I myself will take their new CD, it is just as good as the old if not better...and certainly newer!
B000002UAX|5.0|When this album came out, it was all anybody listened to. I still listen to it in my car. In my opinion it is the greatest album ever made.
B0006L16N8|4.0|I have followed Coldplay since parachutes (my favorite) through A Rush (least favorite) to X and Y (middle). One has to admit that colplay have made changes in their sound from album to album. Parachutes was a brisk record with relaxed downplayed songs that maintain a unique feeling not unlike a pleasent summer afternoon. AROBTTH was Coldplays attempt at being a stadium rock band and they achieved that with the opening chords of Politik rocking like no tommorow, though that album didn't seem to flow as well as parachutes and began to crumble toward the end.  <br />      X and Y is similar to AROBTTH at being another stadium rocker record containing some epic ballads. It also possess a new sound for coldplay with addition of organs to almost every track here. Now I have been hearing a lot of people slamming this record because they say its the same melencholic sweet guy lamenting formula, which is true, no doubt, but these are, nontheless, undeniably beautiful songs that elevate the listener.  <br />       Favorite include: Square One (can't get enough of the guitar part in chours), White Shadows (has an 80's vibe to it), Talk (the catchiest track here, awesome use of Kraftwerks riff)Swallowed in the Sea (nice melody) and Twisted Logic (uses the chord change from the beatles' 'she's so heavy') <br />       Innovation is admirable, but not for everyone and I respect that colplay have found a sound that works and sounds good. If your gonna judge a product by looking at past results than your not fairly judging the product, So just sit back, hit play and let your mind wander!  <br />  <br />By the way, Speed of Sound Kind of sucks! Why is it their first single??? Oh well, I still bought it.
B0000AZJXQ|1.0|Maynard is a freakin freak, all leading you on a path to hell- what a fag
B00013RC9I|5.0|My history of Air began with Moon Safari and that CD made making out 3X as fun as usual! So when I saw this new CD from France's best space pop duo I couldn't resist and bought it hoping it's magic would work just as well. I think the most accurate statement is that this new output is like Moon Safari's less fun little brother. He tries being suave and sexy, and he succeds occasionally, but he also has a cold serious side that the ladies don't like as much. He's more of an indidual and ops to speak for himself (there are no guest vocals on this record), His spacy serious side emerges in songs like the creepy 'Another Day' and the awkward futuristic 'Biological'.  <br />        <br />         But when he's on, He's on, 'Cherry Blossum Girl' is purely heaven. The flute solos sound cheesy but add a mysterious element to the song. Then there is the lennonesque 'Surfing on a Rocket,' arguably the best song here with its guitar lick which moves you (and your friend) into zero gravity. Other highlights include the sublime 'Universal Traveler' and the soothing closing track, 'Alone in Kyoto' which appears in the 'Lost in Translation' Movie. <br />        <br />      Altogether an solid effort that only increases my love for Air. If your looking for a make out CD you may need to hit the skip track a couple of times or you should check out their song from the Virgin Suicides soundtrack, 'Playground Love.' Though I defenitely appreciate their experimental side and I look forward to their future releases.  <br />        <br />

0375830995|4.0|This novel is a good read, bowever I would reccomend buying the paperback instead of hardback to save some money.  <br /> <br />The beggining of the novel is highly interesting when Ed stops the bank robbery. Ed's first person narrative is highly comical and makes the reader want to continue on. <br /> <br />Once Ed recieves the first ace, the novel takes a complete shift. Readers are drawn on Ed's missions to deliver messages, sometimes fun, bad, or downright boring. That's right, the novel has a couple of down times. It made me put the book down for a week. Once you get through the middle and long-winded middle of the book you will keep reading to get to the end. The end is absolutely amazing and I don't want to reveal it. What I liked about the novel is that it's not who or what you expect. After reading for a while, you pretty much feel you know what is going to happen to each character or who is behind what. However, zusak writes with such an air that you are just as lost and hopeless as Ed.
B000001FS3|5.0|This is the best album ever created!!! It havs amazing songs and you'll really love the songs like With or Without you, and One Tree Hill. But my personal favourite is Red Hill Mining Town. <br /> <br />This is the best album and you must get it!
B000002JPA|5.0|Images and Words was the first Dream Theater album I ever bought, and I gotta say this is without a doubt, one of the greatest metal albums I have ever listened to. I got this album 3 years ago, and it took a while for it to grow on me, and the more I listened to this album, the more I liked it. No words can describe how remarkably talented these guys are. On this album, you've got the epic vocals from James LaBrie, wonderful keyboard work from Kevin Moore, superb hearable bass lines from John Myung, excellent drumming by Mike Portnoy, and of course those virtuoistic jaw dropping guitar solos from John Petrucci. Every song on here is great BTW. So if you're new to Dream Theater, Images and Words along with Awake are great places to start out with. Dream Theater rules. Great album, 5 stars!<br /><br />themetalbeast's ratings:<br /><br />1. Pull Me Under: 5/5 (Great way to start the album)<br /><br />2. Another Day: 5/5<br /><br />3. Take The Time: 5/5 (My favorite song on here)<br /><br />4. Surrounded: 5/5<br /><br />5. Metropolis-Part 1 \\"The Miracle and the Sleeper\\": 5/5<br /><br />6. Under A Glass Moon: 5/5<br /><br />7. Wait For Sleep: 5/5<br /><br />8. Learning To Live: 5/5
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is Coldplay's best album ever. It's amazing with great songs like Square One, Talk, A Message, and Swallowed in the sea. <br />You have to get it! It's so powerful and addictive that you'll want to listen to it over and over again. <br /> <br />I recommend this Coldplay album for any music fan out there.
006072448X|4.0|Kevin Katchadourian is a parent's worst nightmare: a sullen child who abuses, manipulates, and controls everyone around him. His mother Eva seems to know something is terribly wrong with her son from the moment she gives birth, as he grasps for his father and turns a baleful eye towards his mother. As he gets older, Eva's maternal instincts about her dark child places him at the center of incident after incident: playgoups that are dismantled; misterious bike accidents; sexual precocity. As Kevin grows up and Eva bears a beautiful young daughter, the family dynamic becomes even more explosive as she and her husband Franklin take sides against Kevin and his malevolence presence in the family. <br /> <br />The inorexible march towards the conclusion - Kevin's violent and methodical attack on his classmates - made my stomach tie itself up in knots. Franklin pushes a Walton's-esque picture of perfection onto the family, and turns a blind eye to Kevin's failings as a son and as a human being. Eva is helpless as Kevin controls the Katchadourians and eventually destroys everyone around him. <br /> <br />Taking the form of letters written to Franklin, Eva reflects on her marriage, her children, the nature of violence and hypocrisy in America, and what it feels like to be the mother of a disturbed and dangerous child. This is not a light book, but it is a necessary one. Eva's inability to mother Kevin is perhaps an insightful look at those women who bore the real-life School Killers, and Lionel Shriver should be congratulated on her brave and difficult work.
1401301363|5.0|I love Nigella! I have all of her books and it is very useful when you want something different, yet not to far out there. The book is broken down into sections from wedding feasts to funeral feasts. I have made the Guiniess beer cake (quite marvelous) and it was the hit of a St. Patricks party. Nigella offers some banter in her recipes so if you are looking for a step-to-step process on cooking without modification, this may not be the ideal book for you. I enjoy a book that allows me to add a little extra or take some out. The christmas feast gives way to some new holiday traditions such as her \\"Gingerbread stuffing\\" and some traditional recipes as well. It can help you organize for a big party if need be. The funeral feast is helpful because it is one of those sensitive times and comfort food always helps. <br /> <br />Hope it has been helpful.

0375703764|5.0|I first heard about this novel on the radio here in Dallas / Fort Worth.  The author's sister is the artist Poe, and she performs a song from her album \\"Haunted\\" that contains her brother reading a selection from this novel.  This got me interested. <br /> <br />This work is unconventional and truly terrifying.  It thoroughly uses footnotes and carefully structured/printed paragraphs to add another dimension (pun intended) to the House / novel. <br /> <br />The novel really gets in your head and makes you wonder whether there is any truth to the story or not.  It is written in a somewhat journalisitic style; almost as if it were a work of non-fiction.  This makes the work even more terrifying. <br /> <br />This work is very similar in style to Jorge Luis Borges (see \\"Labyrinths\\"), but is distinctly unique.  For another work that is somewhat similar in style, see Jeff Vandermeer's \\"City of Saints and Madmen\\". <br /> <br />While the footnotes can, at times, prove frustrating in that they can interrupt your progress through the novel, I can't recommend this work enough.  No other book has scared me more, and I am hard pressed to think of another book that has been more engrossing.
B0002IVN9W|5.0|Ooooh this is *really* good.  Lots of resonances here with earlier, great music from Bjork on \\"The backseat\\" (loved it!) to some great 80's Aussie bands such as Triffids and Hunters and Collectors on various tracks, to all the influences that other writers have mentioned, but TAF are utterly their own thing... just beautiful.  This should be the beginning of an amazing career for TAF, and I think I hear the sound of a thousand bands worldwide starting to plink away on a xylophone or two......
B000002BBY|5.0|Despite the Gallagher brother's being total prats with all their antics, you can't deny that their music is superb.  <br />Whats the story Morning Glory is one of those rare albums you will hear, where all the tracks are great. Wonderwall, Champagne Supernova, Don't look back in anger, Roll with it, Some might say, She's Electric and my personal favourite Morning glory, all are really great tracks and sum up the greatness of British Music. <br />It's a shame some of the later music is not as good as this masterpiece. However I believe, after the release of Heathen Chemistry, is does seem that Oasis are on the right path and are almost back to producing the music their reknown for.  <br />Anyway I urge you all to buy this CD, as frankly it really is one of those great albums that will never be forgotten.

B000002UJQ|5.0|I would describe the album is beautiful.  And is such a beauty that you don't realise it is one until you give it time to ferment.  A few reviews have come in saying it is rubbish.  After The Bends i would agree with first listen.  But one of my mates said give it time and everntually all the songs will eat into you.  It starts with Karma Police and Electioneering.  Then Paranoid Android gets you.  Frankly, after that it turns into an album that never tires.  It got #1 in the all time album list and i wouldn't disagree one bit.
B0000214F1|1.0|I happen to have taken up an interest in learning from the historical and biblical accounts of the Roman Empire...be it via books or film. The earliest and best of  on-screen portrayals of Caligula were found in movies such as the Robe, Demetrius and the Gladiators(Robe 2), and A.D.(Anno Domini, Jesus of Nazareth 2), in either case, you'll find a classical(by that I mean accurate yet restricted)approach to the person of Gaius Caligula(ie, tyrant,sex maniac,self-declared god, psychopath, paranoid schizo, and once who would have hallucinations or delusions of seeing the goddess Isis or/and Diana running through his courts. However, when it comes to CALIGULA, I have to admit that after months of curiousities about purchasing the so-called \\"most controversial film of the 20th century,\\" I gave in just yesterday and purchased it from the local media Play, watched the movie, and my impression was as follows: the movie starts with Caligula chasing his sister around half naked in the woods and getting his freak on, declares himself a god in the opening credits(along with the flashing of a passage from the Gospel of Mark), Tiberius has orgies, Caligula dances, more orgies, Tiberius gets murdered, more orgies, more murders, more paranoia, more orgies, rape, decapitations, porstituton, Caligula's sis dies from fever, the senate gets fed up with his antics, and BAM, from out of nowhere he's assassinated and speared to pieces by Roman guards. No set, no plot, and no sense. For a better, more entertaining portrayal of Caligula, I strongly recommend the movies I'd mentioned earlier. But if you're expecting to see an epic of Ben-Hur, King of Kings, Robe proportions...I SOLD THE DVD IN THE SAME DAY. You won't learn a thing about Caligula's reign...it's all one big porno and he gets killed. Save your money and read a history book for a better picture. CALIGULA IS ONE OF THE WORST FILMS I HAVE EVER SEEN IN LIFE!!! I'M TALKIN' WORSE THAN SOME OF THE CORNIEST BRUCEPLOITATION(Bruce Lee imitator) FLICKS I'VE COLLECTED. TERRIBLE!!!itator) FLICKS I'VE COLLECTED. TERRIBLE!!!
B0006L16N8|2.0|I must have heard this album about a dozen or so times by now.  One thing's for sure - I'm not in a hurry to hear it again). A shame as I really liked both Parachutes and A Rush Of Blood... <br /> <br />Aside from the fifth-form poetry my biggest complaint is that the album's been produced to within an inch of its life.  And, while it unquestionably sounds fabulous, the end result is an album bereft of any performance, complexity or depth.    <br /> <br />Great albums have an ability to surprise you despite the fact that you may have heard them hundreds of times before.  There are no surprises here, everything happens just as it should and therein lies the problem.   <br /> <br />
0767834739|2.0|John Huston once said that a good story should have \\"excitement,color, spectacle and humor, adventure, high drama, tragedy, good conversation, truth and irony\\". Unfortunately the discerning viewer won't find much of any of those qualities in \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\\". What they will find is a mildly entertaining spectacle of excess. There is enough tension to keep you watching, but when it finally ends and your mind recovers from its numbness, you will wish that you had not bothered.    The ending is both familiar and predictable, at least to anyone over age six. Apparently predictability is comforting to the movie genre's core fan base, in much the same way as it is for a young child watching \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" over and over again. They know the ending so the initial viewing does not scare them, and the repeated viewings give them a feeling of power and control as if they are determining the outcome each time they watch it.    The authors of the DVD expect multiple viewings as they provide three separate commentaries on the disc. A director producer/commentary, a cast commentary, and a writer/producer commentary. More terrifying than anything in the movie is the thought of listening to ALL these commentaries. Sometimes the degree of conceit and self-delusion exhibited by those close to a movie is astonishing. Do they actually believe that this unoriginal exercise in excess is worthy of even one commentary. If you can't make better stuff than this (editor and production designer excluded) you should go back to school and get your CPA.    Finally John Huston would say that it doesn't hurt to have lovable hero's in your story. Lovable heroines wouldn't hurt either or at least ones that look sexy. Milla Jovovich and Sienna Guillory are attractive women but if they chose their own costumes (?) for this movie they are also airheads.  Like many women they dress in what they think makes them look sexy. The result is a 6th Street hooker look that makes you laugh everytime they appear in the frame. Check out Milla's \\"Zoolander\\" look if you want to see what could have been; she actually looks sexier wearing old army fatigues in \\"Dummy\\" than she does in her \\"Resident Evil-Apocalypse\\" outfits.    Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.
B00005JNEW|5.0|Actor Peter Berg gets behind the camera and takes us on a journey to the west Texas town of Odessa.  His movie is more than about football.  It's about a way of life for a small town and the pressure the towns people put on these young boys to strive and win the biggest prize, a state championship.  Berg's direction is outstanding.  I really liked the fact that he wasn't concentrating on glitz and glamour.  It wasn't a typical Hollywood production.  There are no heroes, just people who are flawed.  Country singer Tim McGraw shows his star power as the troubled dad aof a football player.  Billy Bob once again shows his greatness as the football coach under pressure to win \\"State\\".  It's an outstanding film that was based on a true story shows us there's more important things than football such as enjoying life.
B0002858YS|5.0|First--in response to the post by \\"Reasonable\\"--Brandon Flowers ins't \\"faking\\" the accent, he's from the UK, you fool. <br /> <br />After some hesitation, I finally picked up Hot Fuss.  \\"Somebody Told Me\\" was definitely catchy at first, but the radio overplayed it, as usual.  But after hearing \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\" I wanted to give this UK outfit a chance.  And I'm so thankful I did!  In line with Modest Mouse and Franz Ferdinand, The Killers do an excellent job rejuvinating the sounds of yesterday without \\"ripping them off\\" in my opinion.  The Killers are definitely influenced by the likes of The Cure, Oasis, Joy Division, etc but they don't sound like a carbon copy of anyone really.     <br /> <br />Its great summer driving music.  You can just pop the CD in and listen--there are no bad songs to skip over.   <br /> <br />Enjoy it!

0060512806|5.0|Cryptonomicon is a delightful outburst of creative and intellectual energy.  It's a novel that interweaves the stories of a modern-day cryptographer and his grandfather's adventures in World War II.  The plotting is complicated but enjoyable, but the best of the book is all that happens along the way.  There are many very interesting excursions into mathematics that require some patience but reward it.  There are fascinating windows into the world of high technology and its potentials.  There are things to learn about espionage, nature, music, language, breakfast cereal, and a hundred other topics.      I don't consider Cryptonomicon any great success as a novel in the traditional sense.  Many of the characters are flat.  And it's certainly too long.  The author is in love with his own powers and can't restrain them.  But if you approach the basic story as an excuse for the ingenious digressions, explorations, and the like that constantly appear, it's a very enjoyable ride.
B00008YJHC|5.0|FUNKed up title,killer tunes,darker and weirder than their 2 previous albums.They're probably the only band in music history to have three 5-star albums back to back (Surfer Rosa-Doolittle-and this one)after Led Zep of course.PLAY THIS ONE LOUD!WHO CARES ABOUT THE NEIGHBOURS WITH THIS KIND OF MUSIC?
B0000C9JFO|5.0|For starters, this is not an Audrey Tautou movie. The cover of the DVD features Audrey Tautou dead center in front and is quite misleading, since she only makes a few appearances in this movie. Though excellent her appearances, she is far from being the star of the show.  Nevertheless, Romain Duris did an excellent job leading the movie. I loved this movie. It taught me a valuable lesson about our relation to others and how we are all bits and pieces of those we know and those we have known. I loved the way everyone in the apartment looked out for each other as well as respected everyone else's origins and individuality (almost everyone).   Great insight into a small portion of the human experience.  Highly recommended.
B00097A5HW|3.0|really waited something very good, but the truth is not it, the worst thing of everything is that although she doesn't accept it she put reggeaton rhythms because it is it that this hitting now, they bother me the artists that change of I generate to please, But LA TORTURA is very sticky, one that another good song but very mediocre for this album so prospective and so worked that it was.
B0006L16N8|3.0|There is no question that x&y is a pretty good album. But is it great? On this album, Coldplay is searching and perhaps experimenting with new ways to express themselves through music. <br />This album is a little more electric that the previous two and you can feel the effort leaking though the tracks. However, at first listen, it comes across as trying a bit too hard.  <br />  The band makes a big deal over the song \\"Fix You\\" saying that it evokes the most emotion from them. I completely missed this sensation. It is definately my least favorite song on x&y. Also, why is Speed of Sound their first single? It sounds too much like Clocks and gives people the impression that all Coldplay songs are the same(which any Coldplay fan know is absolutely not true). A better first single would have been Square One. The feeling I get from the guitars is incredible. Its very different from their previous songs and forms a sort of thesis statement for the rest of the album. In other words, it represents x&y. <br />   Honestly at first listen I was very disappointed but it just has to build. Now I like most of the songs but still something is missing. A lot of the tracks lack the modesty and magic that drew me to Coldplay in the beginning. I think I'll just let it grow some more. But only because its Coldplay.

B00005JMJ4|3.0|This movie is about isolation in the world, of how you're constantly surrounded by people yet there is nothing more lonely and how two people, Bob and Charlotte, are lost in a period of their lives. Bob is an aging actor, having a mid-life crisis and Charlotte has freshly graduated with no aim in life. In their isolated states, they find each other in the most unlikely place, Japan, for comfort and the strength to carry on. <br /> <br />However, I do think that the movie tries too hard in portraying its artistic values with the long periods of silence and very little terse dialogue. It's slow-moving and besides, the idea of isolation isn't original. Other people have expressed it in better ways. <br /> <br />
0670033693|4.0|What a terrific book!  I loved every page and immediately started all over again when I was finished (this happens once in a while to me, but rarely enough that I mention it.) <br />Although it is a mystery, that seems to be beside the point.  It is a character study of the finest kind.  The author is a genius at giving us great insight and character development in a few lines of dialogue.  But oh what dialogue!  The interaction between the protagonist and the other characters is priceless.  I think I have developed quite a crush on Henry Standing Bear.  The wit is quick and dry. The outcome was unpredictable yet by no means out of left field.  I can hardly wait until the next installment.
B0007TKNL0|3.0|The casting is bad. Gerard Butler as the Phantom is much too charming and way too charming over Raoul, the young and handsome aristocrat whom Christine has fallen in love with. It makes the audience wonder why Christine has chosen Raoul over the Phantom. <br /> <br />Raoul's weak voice does not do justice to the songs and thank heavens he sings little. Christine (Emmy Rossum), on the other hand, sings like an angel and is quite marvelous. <br /> <br />The storyline is sometimes confusing and disjointed and unrealistic; some parts were unnecessary and unnecessarily long, causing the audience's attention to stray at times during the 2 and half hour movie.
0805066691|5.0|America is legitimately a beacon of freedom to a weary and war-torn world. Really. What America has wrought serves as a shining example to all peoples for all time.<br /><br />But when the Chinese, for example, chide us for our criticism of their treatment of the peoples of Tibet and Xinjiang by saying that we ought to get off our high horse, thay make a painful point.<br /><br />Somehow, just after America finished spilling the blood of a million of its own people to preserve the Union and free the Negro slaves, the same people (Sherman, Sheridan, Custer, et al were heroes of the Civil War) took it upon themselves, as the instrument of a whole nation, to exterminate the Indians.<br /><br />Why would a country emancipate and enfranchise its Negro slaves at such a staggering cost and almost simultaneously deny freedom, franchise and life itself to the Indians?<br /><br />This book makes it pretty plain that the vast majority of the Plains Indians were no threat to anyone. For the most part they were pitiful and starving, and completley overwhelmed by the advance of our forebears. Most of the attacks by the US Army on Indian encampments caught the occupants completely by surprise and resulted in the deaths primarily of women and children.<br /><br />But we already knew this, didn't we? What this book lays out is just how outmatched the Indians were and just how predatory the White Man was. No punches are pulled, but this is no polemic.<br /><br />So what was the difference, in the late 1800s, between the Negro and the Indian? Why were they treated so completely differently? The only conclusion can be that the Negro didn't own anything of value at the time, whereas the Indian had the great misfortune to be living on land that a much stronger people wanted to occupy.<br /><br />America can still serve as a beacon of freedom and rectitude to the world. But we did not come by this without some shameful behavior.
B000002J1S|5.0|The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway was the last album that Peter Gabriel made as lead singer of Genesis. This album was made at a bitter time for Peter had a wife who was pregnant, and he was always gone at months at a time; thus putting a huge strain on Peter's wife and his own sanity. The fact that Peter acted as if he was the star and the band was his back up group, also caused problems, for the ban was also registered as Garden Wall in the form of a songwriting group of five very artistic and intelligent people. <br />The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway is a journey by a punk Puerto Rican kid named RAEL who journeys through a surreal New York City that throws at him adventures that are more like a hallucinogenic trip, than anything of reality. <br />The Carpet Crawlers is the most legendary song on the album, and it is a song that makes people think about various things, and in my opinion I see the homeless in Grand Central Station in those days before the 1990s; while The Chamber of 32 Doors is about Grand Central Station period, for it is a chamber of so many doors that lead into so many places, either it be on the Subway or on a train being how one experiences where that door leads to. The song also talks about millions of people walking high and low, and that is the wonder of Grand Central Station, when in dealing with one ending up where they started on some occasions, that is so true about Grand Central Station; for anyone who comes to New York City, or lives in the city, and rides the subway from Grand Central Station, all over the city.  <br />I will recomend this album fully, but I pray that they finally release this as a Musical on Broadway, for like Tommy, this is a Rock Opera that should have been made on Broadway.
B0009TRRN0|4.0|\\"Shogun Assassin\\" is actually a combining of two Japanese movies for American release that bring to the screen a story that has long been very popular in Japan (aka \\"Lone Wolf and Cub\\"). <br />  Some may recognize the title \\"Shogun Assassin\\" from the movie \\"Kill Bill Vol. 2\\".  In that story, it is the movie that mother and daughter watch together at bedtime. How sweet. Tarantino is, no doubt, both making a joke and giving a nod to what is one of the bloodiest of all Samaurai movies, a genre known for its high splatter factor. <br />  I first saw this movie in the 80's and am happy it is now available on DVD.  I recommend it highly to any fan of Samaurai movies for its clever story line, customized baby carriage and over-the-top sword fighting sequences.  It may not be high-brow, but it is must-see!
B00004WG2F|4.0|I have always loved this movie; the soundtrack is beautifully lush, the scenery breathtaking, and the performances engaging.  I am not a Brad Pitt fan and love him in this movie.  My major complaint with this movie, however, has been mentioned in earlier reviews -- the chronology.  Samuel gets killed in World War I, and the bulk of this movie is supposed to occur subsequently.  Of course, Tristan's prolonged absence -- the narrator never indicates exactly how long Tristan is gone -- apparently ends in 1921, if I recall.  Seems like it should be more like 1924-25.  And don't these people age???  The merits of the film, however, outweigh this irritating fly in the ointment, which is why I watch it over and over.
B000089RV6|5.0|Anyone who hates this album should be shot into the sun. This is one of the greatest albums ever created by one of the greatest bands ever. The album has classic songs such as Back in Black and You Shook Me All Night Long that everyone should no if you don't own the CD go buy it right now.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|Granted, it's a thought provoking movie, which is a bit of an oxymoron, if you think about it. I mean, movies are Entertainment, and the minute you have to think about what is supposed to entertain you, it stops being entertainment, and becomes work, which is what we go to movies to escape from! <br />Okay, I'm not saying this because I don't 'get it.' I'm the weirdo in my social circle. Tape deck: Pink Floyd, Radiohead, Coldplay, conscious hip-hop - the stuff that requires thinking. <br />Favorite movies: Fight Club, Vanilla Sky, Memento - the stuff that the average dude has to see 3-4 times to 'get.' <br />I respect your attempts at philosophy, Sunshine - no doubt you're a college man. But for God's Sakes, this isn't a teen movie made to challenge religion. The Matrix has more religious undertones than Donnie Darko! DD is an acid trip, in the most poignant sense of the word. <br />Bear in mind, I rated this movie five-stars, so I'm not belittling it. Still, so many of my friends have the tendency to overhype things. If it's just okay, it's good. If it's good, it's great. If it's great, it's a classic piece of art that dwarfs all things in its presences. You get the picture. <br />About the movie: Donnie Darko, like the last review said, is a challenging movie, with a scenario that's hard to explain to someone who hasn't seen. Even after all is said and done, it's still difficult to tell whether Donnie Darko has imagined the whole thing, or if he has somehow been able to turn back the hands of time. <br />Donnie's an iconoclast; he (forgive the tired cliche) marches to the beat of a different drum. He's a little darker than those his age (duh), but he's also a lot smarter, dabbling in obscure sciences, and often wrapped up in an obsession with the study of time travel.  <br />This would make him a respectable fellow, if not for forte for theories about the apocalypse, as well as the fact that he sees a life-sized talking rabbit (we've all seen that in the trailer).<br />All of the performances, both from the veteran actors, of which there are a few, and the newcomers, of which there are also quite a few, are very well-delivered and believable. It's really surprising to me that this wasn't a big movie, propelling Jake to stardom (sure, he's popular, and he got to go out with Kirsten Dunst, but he's no A-Lister). <br />It's very surprising that this was the writer/director's first film, as every piece of dialogue, and every camera angle seems like it came from the hands of a pro.  <br />In the end, I highly recommend this movie. It is a great film, a thing that young aspiring directors may look to in the future for inspiration. So, in conclusion, people, watch it, enjoy it, but please don't take it too seriously!

B0000636UN|5.0|Sheryl Crow's C'mon, C'mon is definitely by far her best and most memorable album I've listened to over the last decade. I enjoyed this album a great deal and have pulled it out of the cd shelf many times since '02. My favourite tracks in this album are Steve McQueen, Soak Up The Sun, Safe and Sound(featured in White Oleander), Diamond Road, and the tearjerking Abilene which was the most heartfelt song that sounds a bit like Home(featured in her Very Best of-The Videos). I find that some of her best songs from the '90s include If It Makes You Happy, All I Wanna Do, Leaving Las Vegas, and There Goes The Neighborhood have somehow become distant memories over the years. But with this album, I still like it as much as I did when it first came out three years ago. It's my favourite cd to listen to on the beach or on the road, because it's kind of a rollercoaster listening experience. She's a great singer/songwriter, and I can relate to a lot of her lyrics in this album, that's why I love her!
B000003TAW|5.0|In 1994, Weezer created one of the greatest first albums ever.

B00004XMS0|2.0|Although all of these movies are extremely enjoyable (it can even be fun to laugh at \\"Batman and Robin\\"), buying this collection at this point in time would be a serious mistake and I wouldn't want you to waste your money. I see that the sales are this are quite strong right now, #300 out of all of the discs available on Amazon, probably because of the new Batman movie (which looks quite good). <br /> <br />There are rumors going around that Tim Burton recently recorded audio commentary on the first two films and it has been confirmed that Joel Schumacher is working on a restored director's cut of the third film, with many of the darker elements of the story that were deleted put back in. Obviously, then, we can be pretty sure that these films will come out quite soon with better treatment on DVD. This will probably coincide with the DVD release of Batman Begins late this fall. I think it's worth the wait, personally.
B000002I7R|4.0|As some reviewers put here - Pictures At Eleven IS arguably Plant's best album.  Somewhat forgotten after more than 20 years, the production still sounds crisp and the band is tight.  Many of the songs were co-written with Robbie Blunt, who turned out to be an excellent and distinctive guitarist in his own right - with a sound pleasing to Zep and Page fans.<br /><br />What did Plant do right here?  Well, he went for a solo sound that didn't try too hard to break new musical ground (\\"pretentious\\" as one reviewer puts it here).  He put out a mature somewhat progressive AOR album, where different styles and arrangements come into play with each track.<br /><br />\\"Like I've Never Been Gone\\" and \\"Moonlight In Samosa\\" are classic Plant tracks and highlight his ballad skills.  I've always felt that \\"Like I've Never Been Gone\\" was the successor to \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" - listen to it and you'll know what I mean.<br /><br />\\"Slow Dancer\\" sees Plant recalling Kashmir and hammering it home while \\"Worse Than Detroit\\" is classic blues rock with some Zep nuances.  Both of these could have easily been Zeppelin tracks from another time and place, giving them some special resonance.<br /><br />\\"Pledge Pin\\" is another interesting Plant track which features a great sax solo.  Driving this album is its excellent rhythm section, which never lets up.<br /><br />Worth getting if you're curious about Plant's solo work, like Zep, and want to hear what might've been - had Plant kept the path of the blues.  This is the closest tangent from Zep that exists, besides The Firm's \\"Mean Business\\" album with Jimmy Page.  In subsequent albums, Plant would move further away from his rock and blues roots into synth territory.<br /><br />In all, Pictures at Eleven makes you nostalgic for the Plant that had just left Led Zeppelin and was finding a new future.  Although he's continually evolved as an artist, Pictures at Eleven was a debut album that amazingly still sounds good after all this time.<br /><br />**Postscript: Strangely, none of the tracks were selected for his Sixty Six to Timbuktu album.  The extra tracks on the reissue are nice to have but not indispensable.  The sound mixing is a little better but as others point out - it's not a quantum leap.

0345452577|5.0|Another awesome Jonathan Kellerman book! He's a clinical psychologist with characters that are psychologists, namely Alex Delaware, who is in many books. In the case of The Conspiracy Club, Kellerman created a new character, Jeremy Carrier. This book got me from the first sentence: \\"Raging emotions, dead tissue.\\" From there, Kellerman takes the reader on a ride as spectacular as any amusement park can send you on. From an aging forensic pathologist and a group of unlikely friends, Carrier obtains cryptic clues to a serial killer who most likely also killed Carrier's wife.<br /><br />Carrier becomes a suspect as he discovers the serial killer is most likely a doctor who knows how to dissect people using laser technology. Carrier is a staff psychologist at a hospital where a couple of other suspects in the crimes work, including his girlfriend, Angela Rios, who is also a doctor. Jeremy begins working to solve the mystery because police are misguided and he realizes the killer might have also killed his wife. This takes him into the bowels of a high-rise building to catch the culprit.<br /><br />Jeremy's interviews with patients along the way include a cancer patient who probably got another illness due to something wrong in the treatment of his cancer the first time. The book takes the reader into the mind of Jeremy and shows what goes on in the work life of a psychologist. Particularly humorous is when Jeremy must take all of his patients and act like he's interested on the same day he thinks he figured out the killer's identity!<br /><br />Overall, a treat to any reader of mystery and thrillers, particular anyone who has read any of Kellerman's other novels. I'm hooked -- I've got to read each one, now!
B00082IJ08|4.0|When the Gorillaz first broke back in early 2001, I was not very impressed. \\"Clint Eastwood\\" was overplayed trash in my opinion, and I quickly grew to hate them. Four years has passed and the band are back now with their second album \\"Demon Days.\\" I rolled my eyes upon hearing about this return, but something happened over the past month or so which has lead to me buying the album in question, and to be honest, I'm quite surprised. I always thought of Damon Albarn as this really fit guy out of Blur, and whilst Blur's material from the Nineties is embedded in the public conscious, I've never been really impressed with their more recent stuff.<br /><br />I don't own the debut album by the Gorillaz because, like I said before, I was too busy hating them, so I can't really compared Demon Days to it in terms of style, content and appeal. I half-expected this album to be full of hip-hop drizzle and dull rap style, but this is very much not the case. Whilst a few songs bestow these features, most of the songs here are highly elaborate, well crafted and beat-heavy. There's elements of funk, pop, rock, indie, hip-hop, R'n'B and a lot more. The addition of strings towards the end of many songs is also quite a revelation.<br /><br />The album opens with \\"Intro,\\" which I feel is a rather pointless way to begin the album. This is followed by \\"Last Living Souls.\\" I loved this song from the minute I heard it, because it's just so fun. The beat is almost computerized and bounces all over the place. The synths are a wondrous addition, making for a very polished track. A possible single. \\"Kids With Guns\\" has a heavy and clunky beat that plods along. The lyrics are quite powerful yet almost tongue-in-cheek. The vocals drag in that intended way that makes the Gorillaz such a cool band, whilst the female backing vocals add depth and texture to the song. \\"O Green World\\" is very much the opposite of what you'd expect it to be, because this world is obviously not green anymore, but basically a polluted landfill! This would be a great theme for a Green Peace campaign. I like the chanting in the background to this song, and especially the way it flows with the beat. \\"Dirty Harry\\" is an amazing song and one of the best on the album. It almost feels like the past four songs have been a build-up to this. The vocals are very ambiguous, and the addition of a choir works incredibly well. A synth pop beat sparkles and dazzles in the background in time with a clap section that adds rhythm to the song. This is a very primal and quite animalistic song.<br /><br />\\"Feel Good Inc.\\" is the album's first single and features De La Soul. It has this really funny laughing all the way through it that becomes really raucous towards the end! The beat on this song is very bouncy and funky, while the vocals are almost muted. The chorus is really strange psychedelic, and is the highlight of the song. The video is also very good, check it out if you can. \\"El Manana\\" has a quite siren going off in the background as some strange, pulsating beats dance over the bass. A guitar is quite prominent on this song, making for a great holiday anthem that sounds quite dry and desert like. \\"Every Planet We Reach Is Dead\\" is another album highlight. The beat is more immediate on this track than probably any other on the album. I think this song is pretty special because the beat is very dirty and gritty, and it completely stops once someone starts singing. The humming background vocals are also very good. \\"November Has Come\\" is one of the more hip-hop style songs on the album which I'm not very fond of. \\"All Alone\\" is another song I don't really like, because it's very repetitive and gets on my nerves. The beat is also a bit sharp and will annoy you if you're trying to listen to this song while doing work.<br /><br />\\"White Light\\" is a short song at just over two minutes long. This song is very heavy and the beat goes down a storm. Then it all fades as what sounds like a masked choir is trying to break its way through. The beat then comes back to finish the song off. \\"Dare\\" hit me right from the second it began. I wasn't expecting much, but this is a really fantastic song and another album highlight. This is quite a club banger and, DARE I say it, rather camp! It's almost like the band has got their sparkly disco gear on and gone down a club to boogie the night away! I hope this song is released as a single because it would be a huge hit in Europe. \\"Fire Coming Out Of A Monkey's Head\\" is a spoken song for the most of it's three minutes. It's the Gorillaz explanation of human beings, I think. It's quite good but not one of my favourites, but I do like the way the music is in sync with the story being told. \\"Don't Get Lost In Heaven\\" is another really good song and has quite a soft piano playing a very melodic tune in the background. The addition of a choir adds an ethereal, angelic quality to the song. The album closes with the title track \\"Demon Days.\\" This is another great song and a good way to round out the album. It begins as the previous track closes, so they blend into each other. There's some very catchy \\"Woo-woo\\"-ing on this song, followed by some crazy falsetto vocals. It sounds like the perfect round out to a very good album.<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 9/10<br /><br />All in all I'd say that this is an album worthy of a place in your collection. There's some great songs on this album. It begins very strong, taking a bit of a downfall in the middle section, before picking up for a very strong final few songs. Gorillaz have proved with this album that they are so much more than just a cartoon band. Damon Albarn is behind them, so what else would you expect? The man is very talented, and the Gorillaz are simply an outlet for him to express his other musical style without damaging the legacy he has preserved with Blur. This album almost breaks boundaries, because there's styles of music here with other styles that you'd think would not work at all, but they do. Highly recommended.ir is trying to break its way through. The beat then comes back to finish the song off. \\"Dare\\" hit me right from the second it began.

B0006L16N8|3.0|Like so many others, I had high expectations for this little CD. I liked Parachutes, I worshipped A Rush Of Blood To The Head, and I expected even more from X&Y. <br /> <br />I'm a little bit disappointed that we seem to have taken a step backwards. <br /> <br />The whole CD, pardon 2 or 3 songs, has a synthesizer churning out every tune in it. I do not enjoy this, seeing as I loved all the piano music in 'A Rush' and was craving more Coldplay-Rockin'-The-Piano fun. They even used a keyboard sometimes, which pretty much offended me. <br /> <br />This aside, the lyrics are well written. I enjoy the songs on this level, and their messages are very well done. My friend brought up a good point though: these songs are specific now, they are not for everyone. It seems as if the lyric writer is writing to someone specific, and not everyone can enjoy it as much as they could in the first two CDs. <br /> <br />These are all my personal feelings, though, and you may just enjoy this. It's closer to Parachutes than A Rush of Blood, though a couple songs sound like they could of been on A Rush. I must insist you proceed with caution and try to listen to a copy before buying to make sure you'll be okay with this different sound if all you have listened to was 'A Rush'.
0440419514|5.0|I really liked all three books, they're awsome, but the third one could have had a better ending. Even though I like unfair endings, leaving Lyra all alone was just plain mean. Overall, though, the book is great, for rainny or sunny days.
B00003CWL6|5.0|The movie begins in an ominous way  with the video taping of girl who is asks  a friend to kill her father. Not meaning to be a spoiler but we are being set up by this scene.    The next scene we see, the actual beginning of the movie, is an aerial shot of a tree lined street as Kevin Spacey begins to narrate the story. He tells us  that  he is  42  and \\"in less than a year he will be dead\\"  The introductory narration is  done in somewhat of a funny sarcastic deadpan.      Lester Burnham (played by Spacey) lives in a nice neighborhood   and is  married to his  wife Carolyn (Annette Bening) who trys to keep a picture perfect house that would make Martha Stewart proud.     Lester bemoans  his joyless life but as   Lester says in his narration before the story begins it is never too late to make a change.   We  learn Lester is stuck at a job he hates and we see him spending his days on the phone dealing with clients.   His wife  is a driven woman who puts on a false front.  Lester and Carolyn are obviously following two different paths although both are going through a middle age crisis. Most of the adults in this movie are portrayed as living lives that are lies.    They have a teenage daughter, Jane, going through her own painful transition in her life.    Camera work, music and editing come together to humorously highlight the absurdity of the  life style Carolyn has made for her family and with which Lester until recently has gone along.     New neighbors move in next door to the Burnhams who will play an important role in their lives. The new family is run by a tyrannical military man.    But  as the story proceeds three   new characters come into their lives: for Annette Bening it is \\"The Real Estate King\\", for their daughter it is the boy who moves in next door and for Lester it is his daughter's best friend.    Three  events precipitate what comes to follow: the arrival of the new neighbors, a cheerleading performance at a basket ball game and a party for realestate agents.    The Burnhams travel to the basket ball game to see their daughter perform and their Lester becomes smitten with  his daughter's best friend and so he begins an obsession with this Lolita.    At a party for real estate agents Carolyn puts does he best  to be the picture of confidence (Bening is quite  brilliant as her performance of the confident real estate agent which borders on the surreal and absurd) and does her best to schmooze and  to cozy up to \\"The Real Estate King\\". Lester who is bored out of his wits at the party meets Ricky Fitz, the boy next door. Ricky's  is a waiter at the party but the job is really just a cover for his very profitable business as a marijuana dealer. Lester and Ricky step out back where   Lester is reintroduced to pot.  Later we find   Ricky has a fascination with the Burnham's daughter something she learns when she discovers him surreptitiously filming her.     Other than Lester, Ricky is the most pivotal character in the story. He is constantly beaten by his father, did a stint in military school and after   nearly beating a fellow  student to death spends time in a mental hospital. Through it all the suffering he has gone though  he find himself on a  spiritual journey seeing the world as being overwhelmingly beautiful and is now wise beyond his years.  His hobby is video taping everything he sees especially the beauty of the world. Included in the beautiful things that fascinate him are the  eyes of a homeless man who had just died. To paraphrase Ricky says he  could see  God  looking back at him through the eyes of the dead man. There is a beautiful sequence where   Ricky shows  Jane one of his favorite tapes - a bag  dancing in the wind. Despite his criminal profession Ricky can be seen as a young holy man. Also   he seems to symbolize the movie's creators themselves as his fascination with the lens and Ricky's can be seen as being one and the same.    Things progress quickly. Carolyn   continues with her questfor the good life and ends up having and affair with the \\"Real Estate King\\" whereas Lester quits his job and blackmails his boss into giving him a large severance package and  starts working at a fast food restaurant. There is definite a clash of paths, of values and cultures between Lester and his wife.    Lester buys himself the car of his boyhood dreams, listens to the music of his youth, smokes pot and lifts weights. He also continues  his obsession with his daughters' friend until finally the two of them come together. (during this important sequence we are treated to Neil Young's poignant \\"Don't Let it Bring You Down\\"  sung softly in the background).   She offers herself to him willingly  but  Lester  refuses and in that instant things seem to come together for Lester both realizing  his responsibility as an adult and his love for his family. It is a type of epiphany for Lester.     Immediately there after Lester has his brains blown out. To tell you the name of the assailant would take away the surprise.    But the fact that  the lovable Spacey character is now dead is portrayed as a joyous thing and his narration that concludes the movie which sums up his life in a very moving, joyous and hopeful. And in the end everyone seems to experience a type of salvation.     Some of the movie is  social satire  but the overwhelming  message of the movie is the holiness and mystical nature of life and the idea that life and death are on a continuum -  very much in tune with poets such as William Blake, Walt Whitman and Allen Ginsberg.     A wonderful choice of music accentuates the mystical feeling of the movie including the main score which is made up of percussion instruments and that has a somewhat oriental feel to it.     So what does the title refer to? Does it refer to the roses Carolyn tends  or the  Lolita  Lester pursues? I think it is neither. America Beauty for this reviewer seems to refer to  American life. Although is may be materialistic and filled withdisappointments has a holiness to it.    Highly recommended
B0007O38F8|1.0|The reason we are hating this loser, because he is just like young cheezy and other garbage today, he's truly dreadful, awful and absolutely lame and this extremely pathetic album defintely proves it, none of these songs are good, the production is terrible, the lyrics are so intrusive, the rapping is horrible, everything about this album is stupid, dreadful and idiotic and wack. <br /> <br />This is absolutely the year's worst album and I Truly hope that 5-0 fades off in the next few years, once vh1's where are they now makes fun at him and his stupid group. <br /> <br />This album is the most ugliest and most pathetic and incomprehensible I've ever seen. <br /> <br />If you want a real gangsta rap album, go pick 2pac's all eyez on me or Nas's Last year's masterpiece street disciple. <br /> <br />Keep away from this junk as possible. <br /> <br />5-0 Represents everything wrong with music now a days. <br /> <br />Music Review: NO STARS. <br />
B0006L16N8|3.0|First off, let me say that Coldplay is one of, if not my favorite band at the moment. I realize that X&Y could never totally live up to the tremendous hype that has preceded the release of this album, but I am still just a little dissapointed, even though the album is still VERY good. Below is my analysis song by song <br /> <br />1. Square One - Not as effective an opener as \\"Politik,\\" but close. 7/10 <br /> <br />2. What If: The same vein as \\"The Scientist.\\" Again, not as good, but still a decent song. 7/10 <br /> <br />3. White Shadows: Kind of a weird song, but it's Coldplay going in a slightly different direction so I will give them credit for that. 7/10 <br /> <br />4. Fix You: Best song on the album and will become one of their all-time classics. 9/10 <br /> <br />5. Talk: One of the better songs on the album and probable single. 8/10 <br /> <br />6. X&Y: Possibly the worst song on the album. It just never really takes off. 6/10 <br /> <br />7. Speed of Sound: Second best song on the album, in the same vein as \\"Clocks,\\" but not quite as memorable. 8/10 <br /> <br />8. A Message: Good song in the same vein as \\"The Scientist\\" and \\"Warning Sign.\\" 8/10 <br /> <br />9. Low: This song will be awesome in concert. I like when Coldplay livens things up a little and lets down their sleeves. 8/10 <br /> <br />10. The Hardest Part: decent song, nothing great. 7/10 <br /> <br />11. Swallowed by the Sea: same as above. 7/10 <br /> <br />12. Twisted Logic: Same as above. 7/10 <br /> <br />13. Till Kingdon Come: Could have easily been a b-side. 6/10 <br /> <br />so all together, it's a good album, but not the classic I was hoping for. I realize Coldplay have to suffer through endless U2 comparisons, but if A Rush of Blood to the Head was their \\"Joshua Tree,\\" then X&Y is more \\"Pop\\" then \\"Actung Baby.\\" In other words, it has its moments, but it just feels a little awkward. Hopefully Coldplay will regain their footing with their 4th album.
B00097DX3U|5.0|The simple fact is this album rocks. The band really gel on this album, theres a lot more substance with more softer songs, and there seems to be less of a power struggle between Cornell's voice and Morello's guitar. If you liked Audioslave's first album, you should like this, its a simple progression, hopefully there will be more like this in the future...
B00003CXUM|4.0|This movie, filmed in Thailand in order to recreate the atmosphere of Hong Kong in the 1960s, manages to marry the claustrophobic mood of illicit, romantic longing to the sense of epic proportion that only memory can bring. Director Kar Wai Wang was first brought to the attention of many American viewers through Quentin Tarantino's enthusiasm for Chunking Express, a 1994 movie that harbingers some of the techniques employed in Mood For Love but registers nothing near the impact of this melodrama set mostly in the cramped confines of tenement houses and business offices.  <br /> <br />Chief among these techniques are the slow motion shots and the discreet ruptures of time and sequence to emphasize the confusion inherent to the predicament of the two major characters. Where slow motion sequences in Wai's previous work were often halting, and combined with out of focus camera shots, in Mood they are languorous and intensely erotic as they follow swaying hips and swinging arms of characters simply moving from one room to another. These shots are usually close-ups at torso-level (front or back) and encourage in the viewer the kind of obsessive observations made by lovers in close quarters.  <br /> <br />The action begins in 1962 as Chow Mo-Wan (Tony Leung) and Su Li-zhen (Maggie Cheung) move in to adjacent rooms with their respective spouses. Since the heart of the story follows their co-discovery and reactions to the adultery committed by these spouses, there is an element of surprise that evokes sympathy for the Chow and Su as they fumble their way through a web of tangled emotions within their private lives and struggle out from under the oppression of a society that places more burdens on them than on their sneakier spouses, whose faces are never seen and their voices never heard. No wonder that love soon blooms between them as well. On the pretense of writing a martial arts serial together they begin meeting more frequently, and their growing friendship is characterized in the movie by their unification within single frames, where they had hitherto been more often separated by individual shots. Their intimacy increases even as they remain faithful to their already broken marriages, and the poignancy of their choice is most evident in their efforts to keep their relationship secret.  <br /> <br />The importance of secrecy is apparent when Chow shares with a co-worker a fable about confession rather than the details of his life. According to the story, in the old days, if someone had a secret they didn't want to share, they went up a mountain, found a tree, carved a hole in it, and whispered the secret into the hole. Then they covered it with mud, and left the secret there forever. <br /> <br />Perhaps a three fourths of the way through the film moves forward: first to 1966, then to, and finally to Cambodia in 1966 following De Gaulle's visit to Phnom Penh. The era is vividly evoked by a soundtrack that includes Nat King Cole and other standards of the decade. Other staples of the mid-60's aesthetic are the bee hive hair doos and cheongsam dresses worn by Su. <br /> <br />Compared, say, to Adrian Lyne's `Unfaithful', or for that matter, Liv Ullman and Ingmar Bergman's `Faithless,' Wai's film seems both staid and daring in its treatment of adultery. It isn't that morality is sacrificed, but rather the full dimension of moral responsibility is explored in such a way that something more than titillation and lacerating guilt is brought to the drama. To pursue the story of the aggrieved partners is an interesting choice, if not totally unheard of. What makes it works so well is Wang's restraint, which is translated on film as the self-control of Chow and Su. This decision brings its own pain, as when he helps rehearse her for the eventual confrontation and revelation. As viewers we never see this confrontation: we are left to imagine it just as they imagine it. Of course we don't want to, any more than they do, and soon we are returned to the private life shared by them. <br /> <br />The final sequence observes Chow's pilgrimage to Angkor Wat, perhaps as a search for love and reconciliation on a religious plane. He's seen whispering into the hollow space of pillar, confessing his secrets in secret. Though we can't hear, we understand the significance of those whispers, and of such a mysterious ending to such a mysterious movie we are privileged observers indeed.
B00080ZG10|5.0|I had never heard about the life of Howard Hughes before, so \\"The Aviator\\" provided me with an eyeopening exposure to one of the most excentric millionaires of the past century, who ironically enough also happened to be responsible for many of the greatest advancements in commercial aviation during his lifetime.<br /><br />Very well acted, and packed with great talent, the movie touches it all: his titanic contributions to aviation and moviemaking; his flirting with the world's greatest divas of the first half of the 20th century; his David vs. Goliath struggle against PanAm, the world's greatest airline at the time; and his public appearance in front of Congress to redeem himself. All of it happens in the midst of Hughes' torment in dealing with his biggest enemy: Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD).<br /><br />We certainly got to thank Scorcese for (yet another) great movie, but as you see the extra fetures, it becomes apparent that DiCaprio is to be thanked just as much if not more. The actor took it upon himself to dig deep into the life of the character, and brought to the screen a fantastically close depiction of his traits, fears and overall personality.<br /><br />After sitting through it, my only complaint (though minor, when compared with the epic proportions of the undertaking) is that it was too long. That aside, this is going to be a movie for the ages, and one that will hopefully create even more awareness about this psychiatric condition known as OCD.
B000268QB2|5.0|It is astounding to see that wonderful and melancholic music like this can still be made with such serene depth to it.
B000003TA4|1.0|This so-called grunge album and this band are the reason why this music business has been garbage for nearly 15 years, I Knew this album destroyed rock and roll, smells like teen spirit is the most overrated song ever made and the only good song out of whole album is about a girl, And kurt has zero talent and a hypocrite, he claims he's so hardcore and anti-mainstream, if he was that, then why did he sold out to MTV, Why did he bring grunge into music, why did he go on MTV in the first place? <br /> <br />This band is such a fake, thank god that dave grohl the only one with real talent that could play drums. <br /> <br />This album and this album paved the way for bad alternative rock, pop punk, emo and especially the most horrendous rock genre ever and the worst one I've ever listen to(Nu Metal) and ruined a great band (Metallica) <br /> <br />This has got to be the most overrated and medicore album ever, If you want a real essential album from the 1990's look no further than alice in chains dirt. <br /> <br />Nevermind was the beginning of the downfall of music in america. <br /> <br />Thanks a lot kurt for ruining U.S. Music. <br />
B0000028M7|5.0|First off, I read some 1-star reviews and was horrified by how stupid some of these people are. If you want entertainment read all the reviews written by \\"Fred Dursts Numba One Fan\\" and you will be confused by how stupid people are.     Secondly, this album remains my favorite out of more than 40 others. Tracks including \\"Them Bones,\\" \\"Rooster,\\" \\"Would\\" and \\"Angry Chair\\" are by far the best songs I've ever heard. The others are all good songs to. My least favorite song on here is \\"Sickman\\" and even that song is o.k. For not even $10. This is well worth the price.
B0002Z1EG2|4.0|Well if there was ever one Shania Twain album to have it's this one. She is truly the one who brought pop to country, or vice-versa, and has done it better than anyone since. I really have no complaints with what's included here, as they're all great songs. However, at 21 tracks long, I'm disappointed that nothing from her debut is present. True it's not the best album, but could we at least have gotten \\"What Made You Say That\\" and \\"Dance With The One That Brought You\\" on here? Despite that small glitch though, this collection is a ton of fun, and there's no doubt that it all sounds just as good as she looks.
B000002X2B|3.0|Blows sounds essentially like an old JA album and a pretty good one at that. It's highly emotive and an obviously sincere and genuine work compared to today's era of disposable nonsense lyrics and non-melodic electronic/machine rhythms. The unfortunate thing is that for such a haughty concept as universal truth and worth the writing, both lyrically and musically, could have been something they put a little more work into. That's not to say I don't like or appreciate the concept because I like it a lot but as a package the lyrics don't flow particularly well and too many of the melodies sound forced (ie. Mau Mau the opening track).     I've always liked JA and Kantner both but this album has some fabulous bright spots and really did deserve some serious reworking and polishing before putting it out.
B0006L16N8|5.0|I was dissapointed by the first single release \\"Speed of Sound\\".  I was leery when I read some reviews saying it lacked passion.  But I was pleasantly surprised at how much I like this cd.  I would agree the lyrics are nothing interesting--but so what.  I listen to music for the music.
