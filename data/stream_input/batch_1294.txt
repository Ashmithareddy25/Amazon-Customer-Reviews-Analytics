B005LS5M2M|1.0|This movie is great but whoever is negotiating digital licensing needs to get with the program. Other companies including Vudu do not have this problem of not being able to watch the movie after two months. If you're going to do this to us at least give us a file type that works with most network media players like Divx. Licensing on Amazon is the one thing holding me out from having my collection entirely through Amazon. I wouldn't recommend buying this copy of the movie because Amazon states they're going to take away your rights to stream this very soon.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I have tried purchasing this three times and it does NOT work on my kindle fire. I only get a blank page with the word Mockingjay at the top. (Many books do not seem to work on the Fire). The first two books worked fine and were a pleasure to read. I purchased this once from the book store built in app and it didn't work. I also used the amazon app without success. And finally, I went on my computer, visited the Amazon site, purchased, and selected the 'send to my kindle' option, and that didn't work.  UPDATE: After 2 factory resets, my Kindle Fire seems to be working flawlessly (except for behavior of the web-browser. But this isn't a review of the device.) If you download this book on your fire, and it does not work, there is hope. Just do a factory reset (call Amazon if you need to - they'll walk you through the steps.  As for the book itself - this was not a 'pretty ending' but it is an ending. I think some of the deaths were thrown in for shock value, and didn't contribute to the story, overall. But the worst thing about this book is knowing that it is over. This was a great series, and I can not wait for the movies.
B0063GORYU|4.0|great game! ez to play, a challenge to win, in 2suits even,  and even harder to turn off.....go ahead play just one game
B0055SWM08|5.0|this was a really cool game. challenging, while remaining fun. I would recommend it to anyone who likes logic based puzzle games, its one of the best original games out there.
B004ECDNJU|4.0|The game itself is quite fun,but there could be some updates. If the graphics were a little more better and the game would increase speed (in the case of survival mode) this game would dramatically improve.

If you like horror, and Stephen King, then this is a must.    Honestly the story should'nt of ended the way it did, but that does not mean don't buy it! The ending realy is'nt that bad it's just I could not put it down I was  so fastnated by this story, needless to say just buy it and you will understand!

1439102813|4.0|The author has written this book in such a way that I actually felt Alice's panic at times when she didn't know where she was. The choices of her estranged daughter is so heartwarming and the agony of the husband is heartbreaking. A true testimony to what its like in some families struggling with this disease.
B006IW8DJE|4.0|I enjoyed this film immensely.  Director Aki Kaurismäki takes his time to develop all the characters, their habits, their mannerisms, lingering on minute details such as the wrapping of a package, washing dishes, facial expressions which convey far more meaning than the dialogue itself.  The story is revealed by everything you see on screen, and it is presented like a canvas upon which to observe all that one needs to know.  Everything you see contributes to the story and the characters, and this film in rich in that regard.  This is obviously not a film that appeals to everyone.  It is not for the impatient as everything unfolds gradually and sometimes very slowly.  The approach is distinctly European and it is a study in character far more than action.  The accompanying sound track often seems odd because it is very unlike the sort of music used in American films.  Stylistically, had this film been made 40 or 50 years ago it would have looked more or less the same.  If you enjoy French films, you will likely enjoy this one and it is definitely worth seeing.
1423140591|5.0|awesome awesome I loved it, i love the whole percy series and this new series so cool so much action and fast paced this is the best book series since harry potter buy it !

1400052181|5.0|An incredible book that affected me long after I read the last page.  In fact this is the first book to keep me so intellectually and emotionally engaged in a very long time. I struggle to find the words to express what it meant to read about the plight of this woman and the medical knowledge gained from her cells. To read this book is to begin to  understand the impact of these cells on modern medicine.  Then the book takes you further to read about what has happened to her family during these medical breakthroughs, the impact of what happened and its influences on the laws and the practice of medicine. Just an amazing book with so many elements intertwined and presented with such empathy and beauty. As a brief aside, shortly after I finished the book I had a minor medical procedure performed. Before they would begin, the patient must sign a medical release form and on the form was a statement asking the patient to relinquish all rights of ownership to any tissue samples removed. After reading this book I understand the implications (signed it, but was much more aware of the rationale behind it). This was a life affecting book for me. I didn't close the book thinking that I knew the answers to the ethical questions it raised. What I did feel was that it just seemed some how unjust that her family fared so poorly when her cells were so vital to so many of the scientific advancements made after her death. It presented legal and ethical quandaries that some of the finest legal minds still haven't wrapped their minds around. Engaging and enlightening book?  And how!! Highly recommended!!!
0312323867|4.0|Must read Something Borrowed first. This book is the second part to Something Borrowed,  and its just as good as the book and movie. Its fun, familar and quick read. Its also a feel good book in a way. Enjoy it!
B004LWZW24|4.0|You've got to hand it to director James Wan: he not only knows what scares you, he can also present it absolutely beautifully. Best known for SAW, the granddaddy of the so-called \\"torture porn\\" subgenre, in INSIDIOUS he presents an absolute minimum of gore to show that the best sense of film-going dread can come not from what the screen shows you but what it resists showing you: there are gorgeous tableaux of the successive homes of the main characters, Josh (Patrick Wilson) and Renai Lambert (Rose Byrne), where you stare concertedly at the quiet complex interior compositions trying to figure out if something is hidden within looking back at you. (And sometimes there is.) The film involves the Lamberts' eldest son, Dalton, lapsing into an unexplained coma after which mysterious spectral visitations come to the Lamberts' enormous home; after they move to a smaller house to escape the ghosts, the hauntings mysteriously continue, requiring them to turn to Josh's mother (the always welcome, if here underused, Barbara Hershey) for further aid.   The film is so excitingly paced and has such heartstopping compositions (such as the pre-credits sequence of a camera moving through a hallway, concluding its movement when it stops to rest on a spectral face staring back) that it seems to have everything it needed to join the ghost movie pantheon with such classics as A TALE OF TWO SISTERS and the original version of THE HAUNTING. What it misses is subtext: we never have enough sense of the Lamberts as a family to understand their larger emotional problems... or, for that matter, how they can afford an enormous multi-story baronial house filled with what look to be priceless antiques. (It's certainly not on Josh's salary as a schoolteacher; but if it's on Renai's income as a composer, why is this never explained? And why would a family with three small children have so many fragile antiques so precariously displayed?) The screenplay just isn't up to the level of the superlativedirection and cinematography. Even so, the film is more than worth seeing for anyone who likes a great unsettling ghost film.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Easy to use. And I like the versatility it offers. I am able to find whet I am looking for very quickly.
0307946711|5.0|I was actually surprised to see all of the negative reviews.<br /><br />In my opinion, this is an amazing book--so layered and so touching, at its heart it's really about two people--one friendship, one love--and the ways in which it changes, and remains unchanged, over time. The concept of revisiting these characters one day a year, over a span of many years, makes for an incredibly interesting read. And although the ending is bittersweet (without giving too much away), it is strangely and utterly satisfying.<br /><br />Just through reading this book, I can tell that this was truly a labour of love for the author. It is both beautifully and thoughtfully written the whole way through, up to the very end. There are times you will laugh, cry, roll your eyes and find yourself completely gripped with anticipation. You may not completely relate to, or understand the bond between Emily and Dexter, but you will grow to care very deeply about it.<br /><br />All and all it is probably one of the best books I have ever read. It is definitely not chick lit, or pure romance--it is a straight, honest and realistically complex story about people and the impact they have on each others lives.
B006QF7664|3.0|[PLEASE NOTE: SPOILERS AHEAD!] There were a few things that were new here, but most of this film will seem eerily familiar to found footage film buffs out there. The multiple camera angles were a nice touch, as other viewers have pointed out.  I also thought the crab creature transformation was really cool.  But other than that there wasn't much new ground trod.  Interesting (because it was in space), but nothing new.  If you're considering watching in on Instant Video, wait until it's in the $.99-1.99 range.  I don't think it's worth the $3.99 price tag.

B0053YGYO4|4.0|I am completely mystified by all the negative reviews of Coldplay's wonderful new album.  Any Coldplay fan should love what they're hearing on \\"Mylo Xyloto\\".  Coldplay has always painted on a big canvas, and this time out they sound bigger and more ambitious than ever.  Coldplay's winning formula has always been to take a simple melody and build it into a huge cathedral of emotion.  They do this more effectively than ever on such standout tracks as \\"You and Me Against the World\\" , \\"Up In Flames\\", and the completely stunning album closer \\"Up With The Birds\\".   The big production on this album is a bit off-putting at first, but after you a few spins, you begin to see how it fits this music so perfectly.  I've always dismissed the U2 comparison usually leveled at Coldplay, but on the excellent \\"Major Minus\\", I can see the parallel.  However it's not a bad thing, as this is one of the strongest, most aggressive tracks on the album (and one of the best produced).  The heart of \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" are the big bold statements, the hugely emotional and anthemic, \\"Paradise\\" and \\"Every Teardrop is A Waterfall\\".  This is Pop Music at it's most majestic and shimmering.  This is sound of Coldplay in 2011.  Also wonderful is the Rhianna collaboration \\"Princess Of China\\".  This song will probably (and should) rule the airwaves sometime in the near future.  It's very commercial but with enough edge and heart to set it apart from most other drivel that passes for Top 40.  All in all, Colplay have knocked it out of the park by keeping one step ahead of expectations, and delivering a near perfect work of Modern Pop.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is an excellent version of the classic game.  Easy to read, nice choices for cards. Just a good basic game.
0374275637|5.0|As a music teacher I am always looking for better ways to understand how my students (also colleagues, administrators, friends...) think, sense, decide, consider, and sometimes learn.  This remarkable book can be taken and thought over in small portions, not unlike the way the NY Review of Books reports it was written.  The prose shines with clarity, humor, and empathy.  The book's findings, of a divided mind prone to predictable strengths and lapses, apply to every sphere of personal and social experience.  Unless you have already been following Kahneman's and Twersky's thinking in detail over the years, this book can change your understanding of how people think.
B005K17RU0|4.0|overall nice app. weather is shown from accuweather.com not Yahoo! nice graphics and you can see the weather at any time once you pull it down from any screen.
B004EPYZUS|3.0|Ghost Protocol is full of unending action, fast cars, and incredible adventure. Scaling a skyscraper? Check. Incredible chase scene in an epic dust storm? Check. Lavish cars? Of course.<br /><br />Like all good Mission Impossible movies, Ghost Protocol pulls out all the stops when it comes to heart pounding action and fancy gadgets. The trailer sets exactly the right tone for the movie -- it's a fast-moving, action-packed roller coaster ride.<br /><br />The plot is an improvement over the last two, and the quality level returns the series to its roots. Ethan Hunt is back again (although a bit older), and he's his normal self -- jail breaks, fast cars, and heart-stopping tactics.<br /><br />Action, cars, cinematics, and excitement are at their peak. At the end of the movie, however, you're left with the sense that this was just a good action film. This isn't the Bourne saga; it doesn't have that depth of plot. This isn't the Hurt Locker; it doesn't have that tug of emotion. But this is Mission Impossible; it's full of cars, guns, and explosions. Enjoy the ride.
B004RJMUJO|3.0|i bought this version a while ago and honestly it gets boring. i just found the puss in boots version and love love love it! its by the same dev and its much more fun and the challenges are great!

B004EPZ07U|1.0|Not much to state but the obvious, the movie was not that great compared to say Captain America the 1st Avenger. The real stinker is this horrible means of a so called \\"Digital Copy\\" - Amazon please have these Studios sell an alternate Blu Ray with the means of a true Digital Copy, one that will store on a Hard Drive, that will transfer to popular devices such as an iPhone, iPads and other portable handhelds (Really seems like Apple doesn't want to play ball). This UltraViolet maneuver is a sham..., marketing, tracking usage, when and where you're viewing and sharing this info with their affiliates. Note that the feature also expires in the future. I could not get pass the EULA that limited my freedom to view as I please. In no way is this a Copy!!!!  I will avoid the next Title with this Remote Stream View maneuver and perhaps buy on iTunes for portability.
B004XWLN20|5.0|Superman/Superboy/Clark & Lois (The New Adventures)/Smallville: Every reinvention of a created \\"legend\\" allows the story tellers to look at what they want to emphasize. In this case, it is family, upbringing, teenage angst, friendship, loyalty, all the things that make growing up exciting and difficult. Of course, there is all the Sci-Fi adventure, pieces of the legend to be that are foreshadowing for those who are new to the legend of Superman (yes, there is always a new generation out there), and just fun Ah, Ha! moments for those of us who have grown up with the story in its many incarnations over the decades. A word of warning, the packaging is great, visually. The DVDs are hard to remove and replace, and if there is ANY dust on the DVD when returned, it will scratch the surface since the packaging is a booklet format and the DVDs slide into very tight slots. Since my copy is used, like new, I am finding that there are scratches as I remove the disk to play it. So far only one DVD had a lateral scratch that caused a small skip, but I suggest great caution and the use of pressurized air to clean each \\"page slot\\" as you remove the disk and return it.  The special features are scattered throughout. Commentaries are very interesting. Deleted scenes are often interesting. Have not reached any outtakes yet. Am awaiting surprises.

B001H5X7JS|4.0|This movie is absolutely and positively one of the funniest ever.  It is definitely not for children.  I think that Robert Downy Jr. should have been nominated for an OSCAR; and Brandon T. Jackson proved his ability to 'hold his own' with the big boys.  This was definitely his break out role. Those two stood out for me although the entire cast was magnificent.  What about that Tom Cruise.....who knew?  Who knew his comedic range?????? Great movie from all aspects.
B004EPYZXK|4.0|In December, 1974, a manned mission to the moon was launched.  It's purpose was to establish an early-warning system to detect inbound Russian missiles attacking the United States.  But, upon arrival, the American astronauts discover that the Russians had the same idea; located only a couple of kilometers from the American landing site is a Russian lunar module.  However, upon closer inspection, the lone Russian cosmonaut is discovered in a cave some distance from his lunar module.  He is not alive.  What begins next is a struggle for survival for the Americans as they are forced to deal with strange alien beings who menace their ship and begin to infect the astronauts themselves.  To make matters even worse, the Department of Defense refuses to let any of the astronauts return to earth due to fear of contamination.<br /><br />I found \\"Apollo 18\\" to be an interesting movie.  Filmed in the same fashion as \\"Cloverfield\\", some of the scenes were jumpy and hard to follow.  Nonetheless, the movie was suspenseful and offered an interesting \\"what if\\" scenario.  The acting was good, and the special effects were exciting to see.  If you like good sci-fi movies with a thrilling story line, then don't miss \\"Apollo 18\\".

Plot lines that I thought would be predictable threw me for a surprise on more then one occasion which is a rarity for me.

I would definitely pickup the next installment of this story.
B0060AY6FO|5.0|P.D. James had produced a very enjoyable read for her fans and fans of Jane Austen alike.  This mystery novel opens six years after the end of Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\".  Elizabeth and Darcy are settled in very happily at Pemberley and are the parents of two young sons.  It is the eve of the annual Lady Anne's Ball (named in honor of Darcy's mother.  As the preparations for the ball progress, a carriage appears out of the dark and stormy night containing Elizabeth's uninvited ,  black sheep sister,  Lydia.  She and her husband George Wickham are banned from Pemberley (readers of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" will understand why). Lydia is hysterical, claiming that Wickham and his friend Captain Denny left the carriage and disappeared into the woods after an argument...and then shots were heard...Darcy and two other men mount a search for the missing men - only to find Wickham, covered in blood, with the body of the murdered Captain Denny.  Ms. James does a perfect job recreating the world of Elizabeth and Darcy, populating it with Austen's characters and introducing us seamlessly to some new ones.  The investigation of the murder, the subsequent inquest and trial provide not only a good mystery, but a glimpse into the English judicial system.  I highly recommend reading this book.

0061876755|4.0|There are whodunits and there are whodunits.  This one takes the whodunit mystery-slash-procedural and turns it on its heel.  Because instead of the protagonist, in this case mild-mannered scientist Adam Kindred, solving the mystery (he's accused of killing a man when in fact he was just at the wrong place at the wrong time) he does the opposite--he goes to ground hoping that the professionals will do their job and solve the case.  If he can just stay hidden long enough he's sure the rightful killer will be found and he will be exonerated.  But they don't and it turns out that there's some bad guys on Adam's trail while Adam stumbles along trying to disappear, no easy thing in a modern society.  Really, this is the best murder-mystery nobody ever heard of.  Read it and enjoy.

B006MGDVFM|4.0|\\"Senna\\" is a documentary about Brazilian, three-time World Champion Formula One driver, Ayrton Senna. Many feel he is the greatest F1 driver of all time. Known for a swashbuckling, spiritually possessed, maverick style of driving, Senna earned the top pole position in Formula One races more times than any other driver in the history of the sport. He was a Brazilian national hero, at a time his country desperately needed one. Fans from Japan to Mexico revered this driving sensation, and would fill the stands to see him- until an early, tragic death ended his career and life in 1994.<br /><br />This 2010 documentary from Asif Kapadia is a brilliant tribute to not only a sports hero, but also a truly (I would go so far as to say) messianic man. Full of restored family videos, sport television coverage, and interviews from friends and experts- this film is well-paced, visually and audibly pleasing. Crafted to inspire, this film succeeds on all fronts.<br /><br />Senna was born into a prominent and wealthy family on the outskirts of Sao Paulo, Brazil, the da Silva's (Ayrton was born Ayrton Senna da Silva, but dropped da Silva later in his life, due to the name being so common throughout Brazil. Senna is his mother's maiden name). Far from feeling entitled because of his wealth and privilege, Senna never wanted special advantages. He had a calling in life, and pursued it with tireless hunger.<br /><br />According to his mother, it was clear Senna wanted to be a racecar driver at a very young age. Ayrton's father made his son his first go-cart at the age of four. As the documentary notes, Senna would work hard in class to get all his schoolwork done before he had to return home, so that when he got home he could work on his driving.<br /><br />At age twenty-one, Senna moved to Europe to pursue his career as a driver- first, in single-seater racing. By age twenty-two, Senna began his career in the Formula circuit. This was only after Senna questioned his career as a driver, and contemplated going back home to Brazil work in the family business, at his mother's coaxing.<br /><br />A lot was going on in Senna's personal life at this time (he had a failed marriage to a woman he grew up with in Brazil, and who he had known his whole life). Tellingly, as Senna was pursuing a career as a driver in his early twenties, he refused financial support from his parents. He wanted to go at it alone. His wife, it is presumed, wanted to live in Brazil, or at very least did not share his driving ambitions. This is important to the Senna story: driving was not the easy path in his life.<br /><br />Senna gets his first break into the Formula One world with the Toleman team in 1984. But it was with the Lotus team in 1985-87 that a true star starts to emerge. It is beginning in 1984 that this documentary really catches its stride, and that the film's rather quick flyby of Senna's personal life, and some aspects of his youth, makes sense in the context of this film's larger ambitions.<br /><br />With Senna's rise to fame, a spiritual, ethical, ambitious, and humble gentleman emerges on screen. One thinks of recent debacles of other world champion athletes, and the imperfect ways that they have handled their fame, and this only makes Senna's humility in the face of his greatness all the more amazing.<br /><br />As a Frank Williams quote in the documentary notes, Senna was a far greater man than he was a driver on the track.<br /><br />The quilt of interviews that Kapadia strings together in this film, from Senna and his peers, makes this man's greatness clear. Senna felt, rightly or wrongly, that he had a higher calling. His focus was unparalleled. My favorite interview was one in which Senna was talking about how if his learning curve ever flattened out in racing, he would walk away. He was obsessed with self-improvement. When Senna had a large lead, despite the point implications, he simply could not take his foot off the gas. He was driven by perfection,wanted to get closer to God through his talents and belief.<br /><br />This, at least in his mind, he achieved. He inspired seas of people. He lived a principled life. Thankfully, Senna's family has finally opened their vault of memories and videos to a gifted filmmaker, some sixteen years after the death of their son, to allow for this wonderful, touching, and inspiring documentary.his mind, he achieved.

0393064476|4.0|\\"The Swerve\\" by Stephen Greenblatt.  A historical epic featuring a true man of the emerging renaissance, Poggio Bracciolini, chief secretary to several popes and a member of the small Italian humanist intelligentsia movement who were seeking to recover the wisdom of the ancients in remote monasteries in the form of the copies of pagan manuscripts which had been lost with the fall of the Roman Empire and the collapse of Europe into the dark ages.  In 1417, Poggio found in a Benedictine monastery near Constance a copy of a copy... of Lucretius's poem On the Nature of Things.  This Latin poem, depicting Epicurus's philosophy of the atomic basis of matter, the inconsequence of men to gods if there were any, the impossibility of an afterlife, and the conclusion that pleasure was the highest human aim, spread with the newly found poem to infect intellectual thought in Europe and to influence the modern western world.  Isaac Newton echoed Lucretius atomistic ideas in his Optiks (1718) \\"While the Particles continue entire, they may compose Bodies of one and the same Nature and Texture in all Ages, but should they wear away or break into pieces, the Nature of things depending on them would be changed\\".  Thomas Jefferson owned fives copies of Lucretius's poem, and Epicurus' philosophy found itself into \\"the pursuit of Happiness\\" phrase in the American Declaration of Independence.  Interesting insights about the relative level of intellectual life in Italy, England and Germany; what has happened since to Italy?

B004QZ9PLU|1.0|This book was terrible. Ridiculous story. Predictable. No synergy between all the stories even though you could see around every corner. Wate of time.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I thought that the app was cool but some games I do what it says but it dosnt work soooooooooooo........
B0063IH60K|5.0|Downloaded this app to my Kindle Fire for a long car trip. This was a great way for kids AND adults to pass the time.
B0011NVC98|5.0|This movie came earlier than expected and it was the BEST price around. I am very pleased with this company and would absolutely order from them again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I have been wanting to read this and I finally got to. It is a great book with a post apocolypce setting. The plot is good and the characters are good too. One morning I woke up and was on chapter 3. I decided to read and by the end of the day I was on chapter 16! The next day I finished it. This book is good but can also get kinda gory.Sometimes it makes you wonder if the world will ever come to somthing like this though.
B005TZFZJC|4.0|When it comes to music sales, it's a fairly obvious fact that a large percentage of those sales occur within the first week of release. With that in mind, one can conclude that most members of Rihanna's Navy have gotten their hands on a copy of \\"Talk That Talk\\" by now. As for everyone else, whether you are a casual Rihanna fan or have been too busy to pick up this CD, you are most likely reading reviews of people expressing their various thoughts and opinions of Rihanna's latest musical effort. I'll get straight to the point- while I do consider myself a fan of Rihanna's work, I have to admit that some of my expectations were not met. For the most part however, I thoroughly enjoyed this album and I will be listing to it for a long time.  I hate to restate the obvious, but this is clearly Rihanna's most sexual album to date. If \\"Loud\\" was about sex, then, by comparison, \\"Talk That Talk\\" would be about a group orgy in the campaign offices of a GOP nominee. Not every song is about sex, however; there are also a few songs about love and acceptance in the form of mid tempos, ballads, and even dance tracks.   \\"You Da One\\" opens the album with Rihanna singing about a man she's allegedly in love with. In case you haven't already heard this on the radio, this is a mid tempo track with an uplifting mood. This is not a bad way to start the album, and makes the song a reasonable choice for a second single. The bridge of the song features a dub-step breakdown and Rihanna teases \\"You shouldn't have hit it like that, [you shouldn't have] had me yelling like that.\\" The incorporation of dup-step was somewhat predictable given the current `trend' in radio music, but in this case, the breakdown does not necessarily detract from the song.  \\"Where Have You Been\\" was unpleasant at first, but I have to confess it has grown on me quite a bit. Similar to \\"We Found Love\\", it features only a few lines of lyrics that repeat during each verse. I really appreciate how this dance song seems to build up to a climax, but I don't appreciate how that climax is disrupted by out-of-place synthesizers after the chorus.   \\"We Found Love\\" is a beautiful dance anthem. The production on the vocals gives the song an `out in space and happy about it' feeling, which works very well with the music. My only complaints are from the techno build up sessions. Once again, I feel that they are out-of-place in this song. Such production would be more suitable for an `Ultra Techno Dance Remix'. In my opinion, the techno breakdowns don't do the album version any favors.   As the title track, \\"Talk That Talk\\" reinforces the overall sexual theme of the album. This song features Jay-Z's vocals in the beginning, hence a more prominent Hip-Hop sound. This song would have benefited from an additional Rihanna verse, as I feel it seems a bit unfinished.   If you thought \\"S&M\\" was inappropriate for the radio, you may want to cover your ears right about now. The opening verse for the song \\"Cockiness\\" sounds something like this: \\"I want you to be my sex slave\\". The rest of the song is not very subtle either. In fact, \\"Cockiness\\" is easily the most sexually explicit song on the album which does not (yet) boast an `explicit' tag in mp3 music stores. Regardless, it is definitely a musical highlight of the album and one of my favorite songs thus far.   I have a major problem with \\"Birthday Cake\\". I don't understand why this couldn't have been a full length song, or at least a few seconds longer. By comparison, the \\"Mad House\\" track from \\"Rated R\\" feels like a more complete song despite being a minute-and-a-half long. Furthermore, it was definitely an odd choice to place \\"Birthday Cake\\" after \\"Cockiness\\" in the track listing.   The album changes pace rapidly with \\"We All Want Love\\". As the title may suggest, this song is showing Rihanna's `softer' side. Judging by the lyrics, Rihanna has adopted a very optimistic view on love and relationships. The echoing production on the vocals works well withthe instrumentation, giving the song a very ambient and relaxing sound.  \\"Drunk On Love\\" seems to tell a different story about love. Rihanna sings \\"I've been let down, but never been tainted so I stay thirsty for more.\\" She later bellows \\"I wear my heart on my sleeve, always let love take the lead,\\" and she concludes that she is effectively `drunk on love'. Her voice is more emotional on this track and the echoing drums give the song a haunting sound.  Just as quickly as things slowed down, they pick back up again with \\"Roc Me Out\\". This is definitely a hybrid between \\"Rude Boy\\" and \\"Rockstar 101\\" from a previous Rihanna album. Again, she teases things like: \\"I've been a bad girl, daddy,\\" and \\"I'll show you my dirty secrets\\". Unfortunately, I feel like there is something missing from this song. It seems a little bland to me.  \\"Watch N Learn\\" continues the stream of sexually charged lyrics. Thankfully, this song features an extremely catchy pre-chorus, and Rihanna sings with her `deeper' voice during certain parts of the song. You can also hear her native accent, though it's not nearly as strong as it was on \\"Man Down\\". Finally, the lyrics: \\"Just because it can't kiss back, doesn't mean you can't kiss that\\" mark the third song in which Rihanna mentions `eating out'. (But seriously, who's counting?)   The standard version of the album comes to a rather quick ending with the ballad \\"Farewell\\". This song is lyrically interesting because it may have a broad interpretation. It could refer to a lover, a family member, or simply a friend who is moving away \\"to make a better life\\". In my opinion, this is another stand-out track on the album.  If you purchased the Deluxe Edition, you receive three additional tracks that fit almost seamlessly after the original album. \\"Red Lipstick\\" gives off a scary, dark, yet sexy mood. Assuming you have been listening to the album the whole way through, you should not be too surprised when you hear the line: \\"Let me grab my <<<rooster>>> while you sit on top\\".   Musically, \\"Do Ya Thang\\" sounds like it could have been on Beyoncé's recent album. Lyrically, Rihanna describes an interesting relationship with her partner. Personally, I feel the lyrics describe a polyamorous relationship, or `friends with benefits' as the youngins like to call it. Obviously, different people may interpret the same song differently, so I would suggest listening to this track for yourself before drawing any conclusions.   The album takes a serious turn one final time with \\"Fool In Love\\". Basically, Rihanna has fallen in love with someone whom her parents disapprove of. She sings: \\"Papa, are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out?\\" Once again, this song is open to some interpretation regarding who (or what) Rihanna may have `fallen in love with'. Musically, this track reminds me a little bit of \\"Drunk On Love\\".   As a whole, Talk That Talk differs from Rihanna's previous albums. It is clearly her most sexually driven album, and it has more upbeat songs that many fans have been clamoring for. The album is certainly a fun ride, although in my opinion, some of the songs would have performed better on the re-release of \\"Loud\\". *cough cough* We Found Love *cough*. Furthermore, a couple of the songs seem unfinished. *cough* Birthday Cake *chronic coughing* Nevertheless, Rihanna has refueled the dying music industry for the third year in a row, and this album is sure to please most of her fans. Consequently, it will be sure to offend the same people who hated \\"Erotica\\" about 20 years ago. (Thumbs down if that reminded you how old you are.)
B004GF244K|5.0|Can someone tell me why, though the DVD version is correctly formatted in 1.85:1, this blu ray version is done in FULL SCREEN??? I usually assume, as do most people, that a blu ray disc' sound and video quality should be an improvement!! I don't see anyone addressing this in the reviews. Frankly, its a total deal breaker for me, and is the reason why I won't purchase it, even though I desperately want to add this to my collection. This is a major disappointment. I give it 5 stars because its a MUST own for fans, but Rhino needs to correct this egregious error.
B0009ZHJ7S|4.0|I can judge by the fun the kids had after Christmas that it was a good film. I was too busy cleaning up to share in the fun, but it was their present and thay enjoyed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is perfect for beginner,  intermediate or advanced learners. Easy to use with lots of great study plans.  Love how easy it is to share online too.
B0063IH60K|5.0|the clarity makes the cards easy to read. the game movement keeps up with the finger speed. l enjoy this application.
B0064TVQ5E|1.0|Have Kindle Fire and app closes frequently during game play.  Very annoying.  Issue with the android software?  The game would be perfect if it didn't force close.  Maybe just not compatible with Kindle Op system?
B001CTDH4Y|4.0|This is a movie kids and adults will enjoy. I thought the voices of the animals were done well and fit the characterizations. All of the animals were adorable. Loved the Aztec Chihuahua and the history of the Chihuahua. Special effects were great.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have been using this app on my smartphone and tablet for 6 months and I love how I can take my Bible anywhere, compare versions, bookmarks passages and find a reading plan that is just what I need.
0307454541|3.0|It took me nearly half a year to get through this book, picking it up...putting it back down again. It would just drag on for a hundred pages or so, get interesting for 10-15 pages and then drag on again for another hundred pages. It wasn't terrible, just difficult to get into and stay reading.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|This app is great. I stream movies from my Mac to wherever I am with the Kindle Fire! Smooth frame rate, no lag,audio syncs well!
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Just be sure to give it permission in your firewall.  Not just windows firewall, but mcafe too. Great app though, able to do all it says
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I love this cover. It is simple and effective. I like the way it snaps over the front edges of the phone so that when it is screen-side down the screen is not flush with the surface it is laying on. I had the Otter Box for over a year, because of my toddler. I was so ready to get rid of that bulky thing. This cover is perfect for me. It's clear, semi-hard/semi-flexible and very sturdy. It is so worth the price over the covers at Apple that are $30 and up.
B005K17RU0|4.0|This is one of the better apps out there and the fact that it is free is makes it even more gooder.  Fifteen day detail, satellite view,local clips and web links are only a sample of the great features.  Works great on my kindle and I go to it several times daily. You can only play so many games after all :)
B004ECDNJU|5.0|This game is really fun, I'm really enjoying trying to get a perfect score on each level. I wish there were a bazillian levels like for guy the rope or angry birds, but this satisfies for now.
B004K8WJ3Y|5.0|Some people dismissed Whitesnake as a hair-band or David Coverdale as a Robert Plant copycat, but they are a really good band.  I had not listened to them since college for the most part, but when I heard a song from the album on the radio and decided to pick it up.  I did not realize they were making music still.  The songs are well written and a bit more rootsy than some of the things they did in the late 80s, but it is very good.  I really love the slower, bluesy feel in the songs.    If you like Whitesnake, this is a worthwhile album to have in your collection.
B0001XAPZ6|4.0|Nausicaa is not one of my favorite Studio Ghibli movies. There is just something about it that doesn't have the spark and wonder of some of the other films. That said, it is still worth watching. The english dub is rather well done and enjoyable. It might not stand next to Totoro for me, but I still think it is worth watching.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|these simple games are pretty addicting.heck they even give you points for a review. try it out and you will see what I mean.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app. So easy to use. I use it in my Sunday School class. I have it read it to us sometimes.
0307592839|5.0|This book has one of the most sensitive portrayals of a character with a disability.  The book meanders through the lives of several interesting, well developed characters, and we learn some of their connections.
B0063IH60K|5.0|awesome game, that i love to play. happy days are here again!!!!! it is so very much that i get to play this.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Me and my friends always take turns playing the levels because the game is so fun! The game works perfectly on my Kindle Fire and so do the other Angry Birds games.
B003L77GRO|1.0|DVD was received in a timely manner however, it had chinese subtitles and had to check turn off subtitles every time we insert a DVD.  Also, it was a horrible copy because at the end of one of the episodes, the preview of the next one was on there. I will contact the seller for a return/replacement.
B004ECDNJU|4.0|Not a bad game at all. It is pretty fun. I do make a detraction however because some detection needs to be in place to prevent 3 unusable flames being spit out at once, forcing the user to exhaust life. 6 times attempting a level and I had to fail it 6 times due to unusable flames.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|The music is great and the voices are fantastic.  The only downer is that only one of the selections is in English.  I would like to understand more of the lyrics but it does not take away from my overall enjoyment.
B005HSL626|5.0|I just love this game.  I can't stop playing.  If you are looking for something to unwind with, this game is the answer.
B005KELS6Q|3.0|This is a very nice quality,and Belkin products are always a great choice due to durability. The color is very bright and pretty. The reason for 3 stars is due to the size being too small for the original Kindle which I have. The description stated that the grip sleeve was for Kindle and the Kindle Touch. I am unsure of the exact dimensions of the other Kindle's on the market, buyer beware if you have the original Kindle this will not be a fit for your Kindle.  The product in itself deserves 5 stars as it is of good quality, sturdy, and durability. The Paprazzi Pink is a bright beautiful color. Would recommend for those who have the correct size Kindle that would match up to this Belkin grip sleeve. Be sure to know your dimensions and compare before purchase.
B002ZB26AO|5.0|To begin with I read the book non stop. It provides a good insight in the daily life of ordinary and elite in north korea.  It helps in understanding how the regime has an iron grip on the people even in 21st century.  The author provides the insight using biographies of different people across all class. I was moved by their accounts.   A must read for some interested in north korea.
B006FLGBGA|4.0|This is not a remake of the original Planet of the Apes movie, which was more of a political/social commentary and really looked to me like people wearing ape costumes.  This movie has heart, and if you can get past the idea of an ape actually gaining human faculties, intelligence, and feelings, it's an amazing story.  It is basically a character study of Caesar as he changes in response to a drug being tested on apes, and Andy Serkis's performance coupled with the computer-generated imagess makes this transformation believable and fascinating.  Moreover, the interaction of the characters with Caesar lends realism to his character.    This movie was exceptionally well done in many respects, and it was enjoyable to watch.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 was that some of its premises were a bit difficult to believe.  Caesar sulking and refusing to leave a highly oppressive situation to come home to a loving family was just not believable to me at all, and since I regard evolution as implausible also, the idea that an ape--even with any amount of drugs--could attain that level of intelligence and ability was also not believable.  You do have to suspend disbelief in order to enjoy the movie.  However, with that caveat, I would recommend this movie for its excellent creative filming, compelling story line, and exciting action.  You will not have to worry about getting bored; this movie holds the audience's interest all the way through, and I cared about the characters.
B0050IY61G|1.0|I would love to review Attwood's works completely, but the sample version crashes my new Kindle Fire every time I open it! Definitely don't want to purchase the full version if it causes me problems! Could a tech please fix/update???
0792160347|5.0|\\"American Gigalo\\" made Richard Gere a movie star and brought male prostitution out of the closet and into the mainstream consciousness.<br /><br /> Gere stars as Julian, a sexy and hunky man in his early twenties, living the high-life in Hollywood and working in the oldest profession knwon to man. His clients are older women who have tons of money, no men or couples, and he knows his career to a T.<br /><br /> In the story Julian is set up for a murder of a woman and the only person who stands beside him is a woman very much in love with him, Michelle, played by beautiful Lauren Hutton.<br /><br /> The film was a finanacial success making over $22,000,000 and critics loved the movie.<br /><br /> Paramount also did a superb job in cleaning the film. The only extras are the trailer.<br /><br /> One important sidenote: Richard Gere was the first Hollywood actor to show off his frontal parts in a movie, something most women and gay men have enjoyed!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|by far the best app that has been put together ,an app that makes you feel good thank you youversion
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this app! it keeps you occupied when you are bored! most of the time when your bored this game gets your mind off the boredomeness and onto how to give the cute lil dinosaur his candy!!! I recommend this app.
B00006JKON|5.0|Jethro Tull / War Child:  The story of War Child was our story for the ten years before the albums release.  This was the world of 1974 with all its hate and fear and insanity, and Jethro Tull entertained us with this reflection of what we were (and often still are).  This is a great album.  The bonus tracks are numerous but add little to the album.  War Child gets Five Stars.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|If you like most need something to keep you going in a personal study that you create... this app is perfect!  Pick from most versions of the Bible and read along!  I'm a pastor and love this app...
B000002KET|3.0|Black Sabbath / Sabbath bloody Sabbath:  The title track is reason enough to buy the album, and there are a couple of other good tracks here, but the rest is Sabbath in full-blown parody of itself.  Although I got a kick out of seeing them at the quasi-legendary `California Jam' concert, the SBS album was the last of theirs that I would found any interest in.  It deserves 3 1/2 stars, but I can't honestly give it 4.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I would say as my own opinion to think that this game is really fun and I don't have lots of spair time on my hands but when I do I have like 5 min. so this is a fun look to for a quick amusement like the game temple run or words with freinds is its fun
B000001DQI|5.0|Elton John / Goodbye Yellow Brick Road (double LP on one CD): This album is a Masterpiece (although I personally like the style of their earlier album better than this style).  John here begins with an instrumental beauty and then proceeds to abandon the `singer(with)songwriter' persona and goes all out Rock/Pop boogie man.  The result is simply wonderful, but it also shows the beginning of the self-indulgence that would make him a mega-star...and a less thoughtful musician.  However, this is a CD you ought to get.  I'm assuming that you've just worn out your old LP and need a replacement, but If you are unfamiliar with this album, you are in for a real treat.  It is a Masterpiece.  Despite my reservations about the direction this album would take the duo, this album deserves a Sixth Star.
1419701533|4.0|The 7 year old we purchased this for started reading immediately and continued for the next few days we visited.  She loved them.  She also has two younger brothers that will have an opportunity to read them also when they are old enough.    [[ASIN:1419701533 Diary of a Wimpy Kid Box of Books (1-5)]]
B000000IU3|5.0|Rick Wakeman / Journey To The Centre Of  The Earth (MFSL Gold disk):  Wakeman wrote the entire score (with the exception of a portion of Grieg's \\"Hall Of The Mountain King\\" that he employs) for his tribute to Jules Verne's \\"Journey\\" and performed, and recorded this mammoth effort (in 16-track on the best equipment of the era), LIVE in January of 1974 with the London Symphony Orchestra, The English Chamber Choir, Garry Picford-Hopkins, Ashley Holt, Mike Egan, Rodger Newell, Barney James and himself, with narration provided by David Hemmings.  It is true that this performance stretched the limits of the recording equipment, and the limits of a few voices, but the result is a pure delight!  Does this album represent an over-the-top Progressive Rock / Classical Music combo?  Yes, in all the best ways.  It is sometimes a little silly.  It is sometimes to grand for it's own good.  It is sometimes painful to hear the `rock' vocalists loosing their voices.  However, it is also such a unique and enjoyable effort that I can't imagine not having this thing in my collection.  The MFSL Gold disk is the best CD available of this album, for those who are already fans of the album.  Admittedly, I can see how some folks would find this unlistenable as the live elements do get raw at times, so I suggest you find a copy at the library (remember Libraries?) and give this a listen before you buy it.  I love the album, so I give it Five Stars.
B005LY4B0A|4.0|Didn't want to pay for cut the rope, so tried this. It's fun but pretty easy.  You don't swipe to cut, you tap the web.
B001R4MEUM|5.0|Genesis / The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway (Double LP on Two CDs):  This is a Rock Opera with an unfollowable story, but the music is so magnificent that it's still a Masterpiece.  The concept comes from some dreams that Peter Gabriel had which he developed into this story involving a fellow named Rael who has a split personality and he is looking for his brother, who is actually his other half (please don't ask me anything more about the story because I can't stand the headache it causes).  However, despite the incomprehensible nature of the story, and the turmoil within the band during the creation of this album, the music (and even the lyrics) are magnificent.  Just kick back and enjoy this one...make up your own story to go with it, but this is one you ought to have (whatever it's about).  Five Stars.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am using this app for reading the Bible at church. very organized. you can quickly find the book,  chapter, and verse. I also really like the reading plans and devotionals that are included. my favorite option is the audio feature! it reads the entire old and new testament aloud!  love it. what a great free app.
B0000009SG|5.0|Frank Zappa / Overnite Sensation:  This is an Explicit album and is not for the kiddies.  This is an album about all those nasty little things that get you dirty overnight; like sex, television, sex, a stubborn python boot, sex, poor dental hygiene, and sex.  Yes, its a nasty little album that I love to listen to.  If you get this one, you ought to get \\"Apostrophe\\" as well as they are great companion albums.<br />Overnite Sensation gets Five Stars.
B004O3YGMC|3.0|This would be GREAT and warrant 5-stars, if only there was an option to secure / lock the host computer. When in use, it leaves the host computer WIDE OPEN and available for anyone to walk up and monitor what the remote user is doing.  They could even TAKE CONTROL of the machine, because it is unlocked. There needs to be a way to connect, but leave the host computer secured.
B0000009SI|5.0|Frank Zappa / Apostrophe:<br /><br />First - The Music: This is some of the most intense Jazz/Rock ever recorded.  It is dense, intense, and really hard to play.  Thankfully, listening to it is a delight.<br /><br />Second - The Lyrics:  This is Zappa at his Comic best!  Not that Frank doesn't have some serious messages behind his comedy, but it is comedy nonetheless.  Compared to some other of Frank's recordings, the lyrics here are not too explicit (Although, to appreciate this album to its fullest, it certainly ought to be heard alongside his more explicit \\"Overnite Sensation\\" album... and there is a RYKO version that puts both together on one CD, which you might find on Amazon as well).<br /><br />Third - availability:  As of January of 2012, this album is not even available directly from Amazon!  How the &##%$*&^%$#%#$*%$* can a Masterpiece album from a true musical genius like Frank Zappa be out of Print!?!?  Has the world become so `Justin Beibered' into blandness that true music is dead?  Has the Central Scrutinizer really won?!  Fight back against bad music and buy this CD...and play it LOUD.<br /><br />This short gem easily gets Five Stars!
B005HWAOCA|5.0|I was in high school when Cream was in their heydey. I wasn't a huge fan of theirs, but I did like their hit songs and also had a couple of albums.  I purchased the Royal Albert Hall Blu Ray out of curiosity and am glad I did.<br /><br />They cover a lot of material on this Blu Ray, including all of their popular songs. While obviously they are a lot older (I kept thinking Jack Bruce reminded me of Christopher Lloyd playing Reverend Jim in Taxi, or Doc in Back to the Future - just looks wise, not character wise) and their physical dexterity has diminished somewhat, I found the level of musicianship to be excellent. The audio quality on the disc is first-rate. Instruments and vocals sound clear, clean and accurate, also well-placed.<br /><br />Someone complained about the video quality. To me, it was fine. The picture itself was sharp and overall it was about average as far as the way it was filmed. I was focused more on the music and audio portions and as long as there was nothing objectionable about the video (which to me there wasn't), I was fine with it. Someone also mentioned that the concert wasn't very exciting. In terms of showmanship and special effects, they are correct.  There pretty much wasn't any. It was just a straightforward concert performed by three legendary musicians who sure do know what they are doing - it was all about the music, not about getting the crowd stirred up or putting on a big production. In that respect, I thought it was an excellent show.<br /><br />I also purchased the Rolling Stones \\"Some Girls\\" Blu Ray at the same time and to me, the Cream Blu Ray is much better all around. If you want to see a \\"show\\" watch the Some Girls disc. There you will see Mick Jagger strutting around doing his stuff but if you are talking about music, the Cream disc is miles above it.
B005DF2QMC|4.0|This review is from Brengun: I found this to be an excellent little machine, an inexpensive way to transfer taped music to my I-tunes computer collection. It is a bit frail in construction but works well and does all that's promised in promotional material. Since it will not be used frequently, I think it will have a reasonably long life. I think it must perform at least as well as products double the price.
0451228375|3.0|Ken Follett's World Without End is a book without end, a days of our medieval live or a medieval perils of Pauline.  Follett has always been a gifted story teller and despite its length World Without End is a page turner, just prepare to keep turning them.<br /><br />World Without End is the story about Kingsbridge during the fourteenth century and specifically about Merthin, the intelligent, but not brawny builder and thoroughly modern Millie or in this case Caris, whose modern sensibilities cause  her to choose career over love or marriage.  It seems that everything that could possibly thwart young lovers can and does and in some cases repeatedly.<br /><br />While World Without End is not great literature, it is a good read despite its faults of modern language and sensibilities in a medieval world.  It is enjoyable and fun to read.  At no point in all the 1,025 pages did I have the desire to put it down, as I always wanted to know what would happen next. Ken Follett has the gift of keeping his readers on the edge of their seats and he did in this book as well.<br /><br />It also laid out the forces of change in the medieval world well. We could see the balance between those pushing for modernity as opposed to those who resist change much as we do in the world today.  He dramatically shows the differences between town life and that of castle life, the elemental world of the warrior against the thinker who strives to make life easier and better for the people, the force and structure of the church as opposed to the secular world of the guilds and merchants.<br /><br />With all its flaws, World Without End is a book a heartily enjoyed.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|just installed this application. learning through trial and error. this seems like a handy tool.  Now it's up to me to learn how to use it. I think I'm.going to.like it a lot though since its smart design and potential for integration of my many interests is all there.
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|Another great purchase from Amazon.  Received in a timely manner.  Toy Story is a great movie for all ages.  I would refer to it as a new century classic.
B004P98QZ8|5.0|This was a good gift to give at Christmas. Durable, well made and very nice to play with. Overall great selection.
B003L77GG0|5.0|This completed the small like set for my fiancé & he was very excited to have received it.  It was his favorite show!  I received it only days after ordering it.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I bought this set for my 14-year old daughter for Christmas and she loved it! It is a no-frills collection and that is why the price is great. The movies are each in their own plastic case and all the cases connect. Very convenient and this way all the movies are kept together in one place. Very happy I bought this set.
B003Y5H5AQ|5.0|My boys got this for Christmas and they loved it. We watch have watched it 3 times since. They love the Christmas Show that comes as the third DVD. Highly recommend it!!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Its a entertaining pass time, when you have nothing to do just open this app - it should keep youbusy for sometime.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|This is imo a prime example of how to make a horror film.  It's gruesome and taut and has a great reveal at the end.  Highly recommended.
B000SCHBGQ|5.0|This book was TOTALLY ah-mazing!!! I started reading it and I couldn't put it down!!! The plot is fun and suspenseful. I recommend it to anybody who loves the Harry Potter series!
B006O5YHUY|5.0|My husband and I watched this on DVD and I only WISH I had seen it at the movies. It was just the best boxing/fighting movie since \\"Million Dollar Baby\\". i was worried it would be just a guy movie but all the women I know who have seen it, just love it.<br />I LOVE Tom Hardy. He was amazeing in this. Really became a whole new person for this role. Hard to place him as Mr. Eames in Inception after this.<br />A great movie.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Well, this app is really good in a lot of ways. Not a lot of terrible things, but you can't castle with your king and rook and sometimes the pieces don't land on the right places.
B0042U94UQ|4.0|When I first saw the preview of this movie I wasn't excited about it.  It looked like another animation movie that had a random plot with no real heart to the story.  But when this showed up from my rental service I was pleasantly surprised to find out that the story actually had a nice story about belonging to a family and 3 little girls who just want a loving parent.  Plus, the characters are likeable and there are a lot of jokes for adults to enjoy.  Had to get this to add to my collection!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This game ready to download on my Kindle Fire, and I have to admit that I think I have played it as much as I have done anything else on the Kindle. I will be looking for more apps by thhis developer soon!
B001GCUO16|3.0|I was glad that they still had Hugh Jackman portray Wolverine in this movie.  The story was fun (although I have no idea how it relates to the comics, so I couldn't tell you if the stories match).  The only real complaint that I have is that there are parts of the movie where it is difficult to ignore the CGI effects.  I understand what they were trying to go for, but if I can tell a scene is obviously computerized then I have a hard time focusing on what is happening vs. how fake something is.
B005IGDW24|5.0|This was great. I was trying to get a3d movie for a stocking stuffer and it can be a little difficult finding those types of movies at the stores. You had the movie that I wanted and much cheaper than at the stores. I think that I will be buying all my 3d movies from amazon.
B004LWZW4C|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.. it was fun to see the characters younger and how they became the X-Men.  But if you are really into details you may be frustrated with some of the inconsistencies between this one and the previous movies that are supposed to take place later.  But if you can get past those (and Kevin Bacon as the bad guy!) then you will see it is a pretty entertaining movie
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is awesome is fun to play in your free time when you just want to beat something up without doing any work
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love Angry Birds. Now I cans download a seasonal one? WOW! Now that's GREAT! In my opinion, I think that everyone should have the Angry Bird app.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|the ads in this app used to be fine I could see them I. the top right hand corner ...but now they block 90% of the screen just as I am getting ready to shoot a bird
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I think Angry Birds is a really fun and sometimes challenging game. My whole family really enjoys it. I think that if you haven't ever played Angry Birds before, you should try it.
B005V1WZ10|5.0|I bought this for my boyfriend for Christmas, and it was by far, his most appreciated gift. The entire family enjoys both the Dvd and the Cd regularly!
B006C45CFG|1.0|My Son and I rented this to pass some time. We had low expectations, but this took them lower.  We agreed this didn't even make B movie. What was the point of the whole thing?  The plot was awful, and the acting just as bad, hard to act when the script stinks.  Hated it.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|The plot is nice with the seek and find. The graphics are also comparable to the same computer game on wildtangent.
B003V4AK8E|5.0|This controller is perfect for all the sport games I play. I haven't had any issues so far and  Don't think I will either. It was a great buy.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|Lots of fun. Excellent images and humorous dialogue. I didn't know what a fleur or traf were, which made them tough to find. Please make more!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This version of solitaire is great.  I especially love the auto completion option at the end.  There are seversl other features thst sre also different than I've seen on others.  Who doesn't love solitaire?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I had downloaded a free version of the Bible for my Kindle Fire and I also wanted to be able to access other versions online. The free Bible App is perfect! This app also allows you to choose from dozens of free Bible reading schedules and the app will also send you a reminder if you set it to read the selection for the day and will keep track of what you read. You do have to register to use the app (free!) and is for the online account to use the Bible App. I was very impressed with this free app as it does much more than I expected! The only downfall is you must have an internet connection to use the app on the Kindle Fire. Other than that I'm very happy with this app!
B00280LYIC|5.0|I really like this book,it's probally the second best book i haved read  It was adventurous and exiting!!!!  I liked how Percy did anything to save his mother!!!!!:):)
B004CLYKLI|5.0|At first, I couldn't believe what I was reading and a little bit angry and felt sorry for her kids.  But then I realized what she was doing was teaching her kids to work hard, and how to obtain goals that were set.  Very important skills that we must all teach our children.  I started to really like her once she gave her youngest daughter the freedom to choose what she wanted to do.  Amazing that her daughter never gave up the violin.  Just wanted to do other things too, like tennis.  I recommend this book for anyone who likes to read.  But it's not as serious as you might think.  It's just entertainment.  Not a parenting guide.
B00003CXCT|5.0|This Starwars Trilogy is the greatest of its kind and I am fully satisfied with it's contents. The breathtaking spaceadventure took me by storm when I first watched it in the cinema in the early 80's as a child. \\"May me the force be with you\\" is a strong sentence in the movieepisodes who thrilled everyone and still does it a very lot these days and always will. The action scenes are very clever and exciting and the lovestory in it as well too. It's a must have product.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|i like this game want need another for awhile. so get it asap.  you have to add it to the other games u have.
1607053551|5.0|The book came to me in excellent time and conditions. It is a great book to learn how to Design and print. I hope to make it proud!! it has a lot of information in it.  Thanks to all!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Nice. This app works very nicely on the Kindle Fire; smooth, no problems. Thank you for the auto complete feature.
0385341008|5.0|If you're looking for a fun, charming experience, pick up The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society (Dial Press) by Mary Ann Shaffer and Annie Barrows.<br /><br />The novel consists entirely of letters centered around writer Juliet Ashton. The book takes place in 1946 as Great Britain recovers from World War II. A unique relationship between Juliet and her publisher, Sidney, and Sidney's sister Sophie, shows unique friendships that date back to their childhood, allowing the reader the benefit of insights into Juliet's character.<br /><br />Juliet receives a letter from farmer Dawsey Adams, who lives on Guernsey, Channel Islands, in the Atlantic Ocean's channel between the United Kingdom and France. Dawsey is in possession of a book formerly owned by Juliet and, from her name and address written on the inside cover, writes to her asking for a name of a bookstore so that he can get more information about the book's author.<br /><br />Dawsey explains that The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society came into being as the result of neighbors gathering to roast a pig which they had to keep secret because of the German occupation.<br /><br />As letters fly back and forth, it occurs to Juliet that there are rich stories to be written about the war years on Guernsey. By this time she has heard from many of the island's citizens and there is much excitement about her arrival.<br /><br />As Juliet weaves her way into the hearts of the Guernsey people, a spark ignites between her and Dawsey. At least from her perspective. Dawsey's quiet reserve make his feelings and/or intentions difficult to read. Juliet befriends a young girl, an orphan, whose parents were war victims.<br /><br />Through this charming book, readers learn about the German occupation and the ingenuity of the British people to cope. The many diverse characters manage to pull together during tough times.<br /><br />The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society is a charming book, one I couldn't put down. It's beautifully written with British flair, understatement and subtle humor. I heartily recommend this delightful  and satisfying novel.ent and subtle humor. I heartily recommend this delightful  and satisfying novel.
B006BDHAX0|2.0|Now having players it more, yes, it does shut and/or restart maybe not every 3rd board, but with alarming frequency. Otherwise I enjoy this quite a bit. The faster this gets fixed, the faster we all give you more stars.
0316098329|5.0|Room (Back Bay Books) by Emma Donoghue could have been taken from today's headlines. Its gripping drama is as real as an interview with actual victims of captivity.<br /><br />Jack, five years old, doesn't know he's been held captive all his life. He believes his life is normal. Jack and his mother live in an 11-foot-square soundproofed cell in a converted shed in the kidnapper's yard. Jack's mother whom he calls Ma, has been there seven years-she was a nineteen year-old college student when kidnaped.<br /><br />The marvel of this story is the balance Ma has maintained in giving her child a rich, loving life, filling his days with exercise games, reading and math lessons, with limited television and unlimited love.<br /><br />The entire book is Jack's voice of heartrending innocence, wisdom and love. But there's harrowing terror, too, and you realize the precarious tight-rope Ma must balance to keep them alive and together.<br /><br />Even their captor, Old Nick, is seen through Jack's eyes, or really through his ears, as Ma never wants Old Nick to actually see Jack when their captor visits in the night.<br /><br />Through a child's eyes, the reader absorbs the mother's monumental task of raising a child under these circumstances. Old Nick, evil and unrelenting, is terrifying in his obsession.<br /><br />Room is an amazing examination of two lives lived in captivity. It's a testament to a mother's love, a novel of astounding depth.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I truly enjoy this game. it is fun and entertaining.  the app was free and it's also very easy to play
B001IFZL50|5.0|Costco has some great deals on HBO and AMC blurays sets, for those of you that have memberships.  This was by far the best price on this set.
B006JPS1OM|5.0|would recommend this of any one. if u like looking for objects and solving puzzles it is fabulous . play it on all ur android stuff phone, tablets, and etc.
B003YL4L0W|1.0|From the short introduction you have no idea the turn this book will take. The idea of helping people who are suffering by introducing music therapy sounds so uplifting. BUT - when the main character goes through a divorce with her husband only to fall in love with a woman - I had to stop right there and get my money back.    Don't get me wrong - everyone has their right to chose if this content is right for them.  It is just not right for me.  It is too bad that the book summary did not hint to this prior to downloading it and reading the first few chapters....   Dissapointing waste of ~ 2 hours....  My review might help you not to do the same....
B00457WZEI|4.0|Not quite what I expected I was thinking it was going to be nothing but sadness! In actuality it was a well written tale of Joey's life and in most part lifelong friendships. Loved this book and amazon had the best price ebook!
B0043A0PXU|4.0|Good classic English Christmas songs, sung well. The songs are beautiful but the arrangement of the song order could have been better.
B004ECDNJU|5.0|I loaded it on my Kindle Fire and was really suprised how how much fun I had with it. It's looks are deceiving, and some reviews flat out bash the poor liitle game. It will keep you busy and brain working, I almost could not put it down. Anyways, it works fine with no issues and is pretty darn fun I say! But I like the nostalgic games that remind me of yesteryear.  A little gem of a game, not too deep so you can jump in any time where you left off or jump ahead and/or adjust speed for more challenge. Thumbs up!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I just learned how to play chess and I love it. this game is great for beginers. this is a great game.
B001IXXYBA|5.0|This is one of my all-time favorite movies. A quintessential 'Love Story' ended by an act of merciless EVIL and GREED by the supposed friend of a deeply in love couple. This a tear jerker, especially during a love dance sceneplay to the music score of the Righteous Brothers' 'Unchained Melody'. Nominated for five Academy Awards, it won two in a particularly good year (1990) for great movies. Actually to be completely fair and truthful this movie is better lesson of the struggle and results of good versus evil and its eternal wages of personal destiny than any sermon I ever boringly heard in any church service.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Smooth operation. Challenging games. l've not had any complaints yet about this app, except that I can't stop playing it.
B0058ZPNOK|4.0|Hesher is a dick...and a nice guy. These aspects often take turns. Sometimes they work together. Neither goes away. At the end of the movie he's still a dick...and a nice guy...and has a tremendous impact on the family he crashes with. The good impact dominates at the end, but it's not all good.  A pretty impressive movie. Difficult to pull off effectively. The stellar cast nails down every character with solid believability.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very cool app. lots of games ha ha ha good game and again good games very nice game
B005HP2J66|4.0|The images of the interior of the cave with its astonishing artwork are magical as presented in usually very effective 3D. A few of the interviews are useful and enlightening. Some of Herzog's own fanciful leaps, not so much. Fortunately, he stays out of the way most of the time and just lets us enjoy these cave paintings we're unlikely to ever see another way.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this game was pretty good but you need persistence to suceed and I had fun but it is also time consuming. I reccomend getting this book
B0056BU3I2|3.0|When the very first line uttered is internally inconsistent and utter nonsense it gives you a good idea what you're in for. The things people will see this for are well done, physics defying action pieces but there's never any real suspense because the whole thing is completely predictable - like a really expensive Roadrunner cartoon.   I heard that Dwayne Johnson put on thirty pounds of muscle for this role. I'm not sure why. The role doesn't require it. My guess is that he wanted to make sure he looked like a credible opponent for his fight with Vin Diesel, but he ended up looking like he could snap Vin in half without trying so the fight lost credibility anyway.
B005ZUR724|1.0|its really frustrating that you cant play a game you paid for.  I also have this app on my iphone and it works great, so get with the program Kindle!!!
B00005JM8V|4.0|An extremely valuable document of the extermination of Jews during WWII. The twenty-five years since it's release add a second layer as a document of the 70s, when it was filmed. I am ambivalent about the length of the film. The length allows us to get to know the interviewees and the locations well and become immersed in the details of lives lived so immersed in horror that it became, for some, routine. On the other hand, the innumerable and sometimes repetitious advancing or retreating shots and the subtitling of the interviews conducted via translator could have been tightened up in editing to cut an hour or more off the running length with little chance of undermining it's impact.   I expect that the running time was more effective in the mid-Eighties when the film was released and these stories were a revelation than it is now when most of us have been exposed to many, many details of WWII that were less easily shared in the decades closer to the war.
B005M5XCZ8|5.0|For those of you who don't know, this edition of X-Men: First Class is not available at all stores, thus why the price is more expensive. I was fortunate enough to get this edition at Target, and they have a ton of them there, so if you live near a Target store, check there and get yourself a copy!   Anyways, for those of you who aren't aware, the normal Blu-Ray release of this film does not include a DVD copy of the film, which may be an inconvenience to some. However, this release does, as well as the Blu-Ray disc and Digital Copy Disc from the normal release. Unless you need a DVD copy of the film, you don't need to get this release. However, I think that this should have just been the original release, because it is convenient to get a DVD copy of the film. The film itself is fantastic, one of the best comic books ever made along with The Dark Knight, and it is presented in beautiful 1080P HD, with one of the best transfers released this year. The audio quality is also fantastic and will shake the walls with it's fantastic mixing and volume levels. As for the special features, they are solid if not a little underwhelming. The features on the disc are great, such as the X marks the spot viewing mode that has X's placed in specific parts of the movie to show a behind the scenes feature (kind of like on The Dark Knight release), a documentary on mutants, and some stunt work stuff. It was overall solid, but I wish there was more. Still, it is worth the price if you are an X-Men fan or enjoyed the film.   Again, I don't know why the original release didn't come with a DVD copy of the film, I think that it is somewhat ridiculous. And if you are buying this product online, don't even bother because you will most likely feel ripped off. However, if you have a Target store nearby with copies of this edition in stock, it is worth picking up. It's the same price as the other release and includes a DVD copy of the film. If, however, you don't have one near you or any copiesin stock, the normal release should be just fine.
B005FJ7DOM|4.0|[[ASIN:B002WY65VU Zombieland]] crossed with [[ASIN:B001FB5634 The Road]]. Very bleak and pretty darned good for what it is. A movie that commits to its story and its world and doesn't pull its punches.
B004A8ZWVK|4.0|I was greatly relieved to discover that this movie was done well!  I read the book and found that it should easily be adapted for the screen, and it seems that it was.  Light and entertaining.  Made me laugh and cry.  Great movie.
B004LWZVZC|4.0|A well made courtroom drama examining issues of fairness, rights, and constitutionality in the pursuit of political ends. This exploration of the trampling of rights and laying aside of the constitution is a fitting bookend in telling the end story of the President who started us down the slippery slope of wholesale Executive disregard for the Constitution which has accelerated ever since. (Not that that is addressed in the movie, but it gives the movie extra punch for those who know their history.)
B001UV4XHY|5.0|as with all harry potter dvd's this was the final and the best and pulled the whole story together and will be viewed several times
B005DD7H50|3.0|Girl dumps boy for not living up to the potential she saw in him. Boy uses drug to not just live up to but surpass that potential. Complications follow. But really, money is the ultimate aphrodisiac so you know as long as he can keep the money coming he can keep the girl (plus a few bonus trysts along the way).
B004EPZ0BG|5.0|I thought this movie is good. I think Mila Kunis is a great actor. I wish she would do some more movies.  It would be nice if she did a fairytale movie since in this movie she was talking about it so maybe she should do one.   I liked this movie alot, Friends with Bebefits is a fun thing to do anyway. It's better to sleep around and have fun in life. Just as long as people are being safe.
B0063IH60K|5.0|great free app!  ads are minimal - just at start of new game.  great time waster! I would recommend this app to all.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I really like this case. I wasn't too sure when I read the negative reviews but I took the risk and it turned out really well. It does it's job and it doesn't make my kindle bulky at all! So easy to carry around in my purse. I've read where people say that the stand doesn't work for them...well I don't know what they are doing wrong but it works for me!
B003UESJH4|5.0|This is an excellent movie and the price was very affordable. I also purchased  The Queen which was also very good.  The other video was a Christmas gift which  was very much appreciated.
B004RBXVFO|5.0|I've never read any of Stephen King's other works, yet I loved this book. King's candid, engaging writing style drew me in, and I found myself nodding in agreement with his thoughts on different aspects of writing.<br /><br />King thumbs his nose most of the standard writing advice (Strunk and White's Elements of Style being a notable exception), yet he makes it clear that writers should take writing very, very seriously. Any writer would do well to heed King's advice regarding not copping to faddish writing styles, but instead studying the craft and developing their own ways of writing based upon that understanding.<br /><br />King illustrates his points on language, pacing, dialogue, and more with relevant examples of prose, either from his work or others'. The examples solidify the concepts he discusses and make it easier for beginning writers to put them to work in their own writing. King also discusses what other novelists do, or don't do, in their writing, pointing beginning writers toward other examples that they can read at a later time.<br /><br />King's clever use of metaphor makes the book even more appealing. He describes the \\"toolbox\\" every writer must have and why, going into detail about what should be in each \\"level\\" of that toolbox. I also enjoyed King's allusion to digging up a fossil in regard to finding the story.<br /><br />Perhaps most useful of all is King's description of a composite of up-and-coming writers he calls \\"Frank.\\" Through his careful description of the many actions Frank has taken to break through as a writer, King dispels the myth that writers who have broken through have inside connections or otherwise got lucky. This is probably the most thorough and accurate description of what it takes to become a working novelist I've read so far.<br /><br />On Writing belongs on every writer's bookshelf. One part autobiography, one part writing reference, one part kick in the seat of the pants, this book is one that writers will find themselves turning to time and again.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I thought it was pretty decent. There where some games that had confusing defections but once you play it you could understand it better.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|It is a fun app that has variety of games that the kids and I can enjoy. It keeps my son busy.
B00526ZKYS|5.0|I tore through this book, i power of love was just too strong. I had to read the end over and over and over picturing it in my mind.

B002ZWSFEY|5.0|Apparently Echo's not the only one developing the possibilities of independent thought while in doll state.  Now there's an evil twin who's out to get her -- or Carolyn anyway.  Best part is all extended part for our favorite geek stud, Tofer. Only problem is this episode is kind of like a roller coaster ride where you get to the top, start to go down but are suddenly zapped back to the passenger platform.  At the end, I had the sensation of missing a major portion of the ride.  This reminds me of the limp plots created by Whedon right after Angel left the Buffy series until the romance with Spike heated up.  Hopefully this trend will reverse itself in the next few episodes.
B005HSL626|1.0|after playing for one minute it just went black and then white whoever made this game is a moron and twentie. word minimum dumb
B002VPE7AQ|5.0|Perfect Chemistry is another one of those cliche storys about two races, their rivalry and how one person from each side falls in love with each other. Grease, West Side Story, Romeo and Juliet, and just plain old rich fall for the poor. One things for sure, EVERYONE loves the cliche even though they don't admit it. Come on! Some of the best things are cliche, hello... Vampires. Everyone should stop complaining about it being \\"cliche\\" and just admit that it was a FABULOUS cliche.<br /><br />This book was beyond wonderful, it kept me up all night, and to tell you the truth, not many books have done that. This is my first read from Simone Elkeles and I was simply blown away. Her reputation of producing amazing contemporary romances is by far true!<br /><br />Everything about this book seemed so real and true. Elkeles really went out there and researched about gangs, heir scenarios and how things work with them. She really kept this book by the book if you know what I mean.<br /><br />Brittany and Alex are complex characters with major family problems. They're both striving to keep up an image. Brittany with her perfect life and Alex with his bad-boy-gang-not-so-perfect-life. They were both so real, and a reader can't help but feel like they really know them.<br /><br />To sum it all up, Perfect Chemistry is that GOOD and is by far one of the best YA Romances I've read and the best way to start the new year! A guaranteed unputdownable book from Simone Elkeles.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|i got this book from one of my friends and it was amazing! its full of twist and turns and sucks you in, it was also VERY emotionally \\"exhusting\\".i couldnt get it out of my mind for days! I think the Characters reactionss are very realitible at times escpsecially clay's. this entire book is like one big puzzle
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is incredible! I love all the different levels and themes! This game is definitely worthy of five stars!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this version of solitaire is really good! I can play it very easily on my kindle fire. highly recommended! :)
B005J6LKVI|5.0|The movie was excellent.  I saw it in the theater before, so I knew what was going to happen, but my daughter hadn't seen it yet.  She thought it was really good, and she's 15 years old.  She said it teaches a valuable lesson on how rampant racism was in the 50's and 60's.  The actors did a fantastic job in this film.  I give it two thumbs up!!  It's a good movie to have in your home library.
B001UV4XIS|4.0|This is probably the \\"darkest\\" of the series.  The fun and humor of the earlier films is overshadowed by the seriousness of Harry's situation.  Ron and Hermione are fully matured now, although Ron still suffers from his insecurity over Hermione's relationship with Harry.  Although these films are loved by the preteens, this one might be better suited to the over 15 group.
0385534639|4.0|I can see why this book is flying up the bestsellers lists. The word 'magical' has been used often to describe this book, and indeed it offers the reader entry into the world of the magical, a world that exists within a circus and everything we've always found magical about the place.  However, do we spare a thought for what really harnesses magic and what impact magic may have on people unwittingly caught up in the very fabric of it? How will they be changed if the magic were to fade or even disappear? Is magic a weight that can, when invoked, be borne without consequence?  The author spins a wonderful fantastical tale that wraps the reader in gossamer threads of delight, joy and love, but in the skein are some threads that hint at a dark mystery and danger.   A boy and a girl, initially unknown to each other, are competitors in a game in which they have not been given rules. They only know that they need to make moves to challenge the other, to show that they're more talented in what they do ... and that is magic. The night circus is their stage. It draws crowds whenever it appears, the black and white striped tents a magnet for young and old alike. But as the competition becomes more intense and love finds the young duo, understanding how the game ends results in some surprising decisions and new beginnings.  Not everything is explained in the end, but then again, there has to be some mystery to magic.

You will get a whole new insite into a family that we know so little about, yet remain an object of fascination for all of us.  If you haven't seen this film, BUY IT NOW!

0060558121|4.0|\\"American Gods\\" was voted #2 of the best Science Fiction & Fantasy books written in the last decade by tor.com.  It also won a Hugo award in 2002.  I can see why it's well-liked.  It's well-written.  Gaiman is a wonderful story teller.  The story plot has an awesome structure.  The endings are satisfying.  As an added benefit, if you've happened to visit any of the landmarks described in this book, you'll enjoy the meticulous attention to detail as you watch events unfold.  It would be a perfect book if it weren't for three main flaws, which I'll get to in a minute.<br /><br />First, I'll harp on his humorous grotesque style of writing.  It's similar to Stephen King, except where King's horror has an \\"evil\\" feel to it, Gaiman's is a little lighter and funny.  Think \\"Coraline\\" vs. \\"Carrie.\\"  Gaiman also has a knack of coming up with the funniest one-liners and most quotable quotes.  He achieves this by taking a common saying and changing or switching a word or two.  For example, one character moans about how he wishes to get away \\"from a world in which opiates have become the religion of the masses.\\"<br /><br />When you read the book, you learn quickly that gods are real and they walk among us.  We humans create the gods by simply believing.  When we stop believing, the gods become incredibly impotent.  So, you have your old gods, such as the Norse and Roman pantheons.  Then you have your newer gods such as technology, media, and industry, etc.  One of these gods, who calls himself Wednesday, enlists a human named Shadow to protect him in an upcoming war among the gods.  What you get is a highly imaginative story with all kinds of fun twists.<br /><br />But then there are those three flaws.<br /><br />#1) The novel is interspersed with random short vignettes of indirectly related dealings between humans and gods.  In these short stories, either a god is created, or a god royally screws over a human.  These vignettes tend to be Rated R in nature (in a novel that's predominately PG-13).  One would expect these vignettes to tie in together with the main story, but the tie-in was very disappointing and not very relevant.  (It happens on page 290 in my 460-page edition in almost a footnote.)  I snoozed through a couple of the stories, and it didn't seem liked I missed anything when I \\"scanned.\\"<br /><br />#2) The book feels like a PG-13 story with some Rated R stuff added just to give the book some \\"maturity,\\" as if in an attempt to add hair on your chest by reading it.  Everybody and their dog drops the F-bomb (which came across to me as a very distracting overused cliche).  I know this book explores the human condition and our biggest desires, secrets, and foibles; but if we're all this bad, then we're all screwed.  My personal experience is that we humans are much better than this.  Because of the book's \\"mature\\" elements, I am unable to recommend this book to a majority of my friends.<br /><br />#3) The characters in the book seem to move around like pieces on a chessboard.  It's unclear why some characters do what they do (besides being there to push the story along).  When it's hard to care for the characters, that's when I put the book down.  I had a very hard time getting through the middle of the book.  We do learn near the end what drives some of the characters, but I wish we could have had some of that earlier so I'd care about them earlier.<br /><br />Despite these flaws, I'm glad I read this book.  I look forward to the rumored movie that should be coming out in the near future.  I'll probably read more Gaiman down the road, but I have so many books cued up already.  When I do get back to him, what shall I read?  Maybe I'll read his \\"Underbridge Academy\\" next.se vignettes to tie in together with the main story, but the tie-in was very disappointing and not very relevant.

B004EPZ07K|5.0|This is a good movie, I enjoyed it.  Hopefully DC will bring out more movies based on their characters.  Currently there is Batman, Superman, and Green Lantern.  There are many characters to choose from and make a movie about.  This movie was well done, and the cast was pretty well selected.
B0058VW36U|5.0|very well made and fun. I have 3 star-ed all the levels. :) I would recommend this to any cell phone gamer. lol
B003Y5H5C4|4.0|This is a funny movie.  It is supposedly based on something that happened in real life.  The acting was pretty good, and the cast was well picked.  The shipping was relatively fast.
1863514201|5.0|I would really like to thank Trish Burr for writing this book.  I've got several needle painting books and, as gorgeous as they are, are not suitable for beginners.  Ms. Burr goes step by step with clear writing and crisp photography to show you how to get started.  You start with the simplest of projects and graduate to the cool stuff.  I bought all the colored thread needed for all of the projects and, to be honest, it was not cheap, but I'm progressing at great speed and I KNOW, based on this book, I'll be able to needle paint with ease when I've finished them all.
B00433TO52|3.0|When searching for a Kindle edition of the Complete Works of Shakespeare it is less a question of which Folio the text was based on or who the final editor might be, it is all about formatting. This realization dawned on me during the course of the several frustrating hours I spent looking at samples from the first twenty collections listed in the Kindle store. Apparently, the text of plays presents some formidable formatting problems for the electronic readers and this was evident given the generally very poor quality of the editions that are available.  Proper formatting makes the play easier to read and may also help in understanding both the action and the interactions among the characters.  In many of the Kindle editions, it is difficult to identify the speaker, the transitions between scenes or acts are not distinct; these are problems that cannot be corrected by adjusting the font size on a computer or device. One problem that can be fixed by changing the font size is when the text appears as if written in paragraphs rather than in separate lines of iambic pentameter.  Many of the Kindle editions have no table of contents and a majority of those I viewed had no dramatis personae at the beginning of each play.  The quality of the formatting seems to be unrelated to cost; many free editions were superior to those costing from several up to twenty dollars. One exception to this general observation is the Oxford Edition which had the most pleasing formatting among those I viewed.<br /><br />The Ultimate Collection suffers from many of the formatting problems mentioned above.  Although the speaker is identified clearly, the position on the line at which the speaker's name appears seems to vary almost randomly throughout the text. The transition from one scene to the next is so subtle as to be missed easily.  However, the edition does have a dramatis personae.<br /><br />Many may be unmoved by the formatting problems I describe and, if that be the case, then there are a great number of acceptable Kindle editions from which to choose.  If one is bothered by poor formatting then one could invest almost thirty dollars in the Oxford edition. Other alternatives would be to use either of two excellent web archives of the collected works [...] but of course one would need to be online.  One can download Shakespeare plays from [...] after having registered with the site. Finally, there is an excellent free Shakeaspeare App that gives one full access the complete works, in addition to excellent formatting, on the iPad and iPhone.are a great number of acceptable Kindle editions from which to choose.

0307949486|5.0|I cannot say enough good things about this novel. I am a mystery junkie who rarely strays from my beloved psychopathic serial killer genre (Tami Hoag, Mary Higgins Clark, James Patterson). I picked up this book not knowing nothing about it other than it's popularity, and I am still berating myself for not reading it sooner. As many people had told me, the first 50 pages can be a bit difficult to get through -- it took me a few tries to do so -- but after that, I could not put it down. I devoured the first two books in the series, and the only reason I have yet to read the final installment is that I am going to be so devastated when it's over. I hate to admit it, but the last time I was this engaged in a series and this attached to the characters was while reading Harry Potter. I found the translation very smooth and effective, although I did not read it in Swedish so I have no point of comparison.
0439023521|3.0|My 12 y.o. son and I began this book fighting over who was taking longer to turn the page because that's what it started out as - a page turner..... fer sure!  But of couse I lost out and he filled me in on the ending because I had to oversee his homework assigned by his 6th grade teacher. The assignment required a written page for each 2 chapters on What I KNOW, What I want to learn in these next 2 chapters and finally What I LEARNED from reading these 2 chapters.   When he explained the last several chapters to me I tried not to signal my disappointment.   I asked him how he felt about the plot resolution and he said.... hmmm kinda ho hum... that he was expecting more.   I mean I get that the premise is fighting to the death but when we looked at Katniss' evolution - she went from a self-sacrificing - give my life for my loved ones - to survival of the fittest - to 'Gee - let's play russian roulette with dual suicide and see if that works to get our way'.    Maybe that works for an older age of young adults but I was a little dismayed at the suicide pact when the real world of young adults has its fair share of this reality. So I asked my son, what was the author's message? What was Suzanne Collins' theme - what was she saying to her readers? That sometimes it's ok to kill? That morality is not so clear when our lives are at stake?  Maybe I'm not a mother of a teenager yet and may have to eventually deal with the 'oh mom - it's just a story' - 'i'm not going to go out and kill or be killed'   So what was the Author's message?   My son asked - \\"Do all stories have to have an author's message, mom?\\"  Well - what do y'all think?
B0068TJLSY|1.0|the movie was shot in such dark scenes that you could not see half of the movie. Most of the movie is soo unbelievable that its annoying. Don't bother. Heck I dont think I will watch any more movies from with JJ Abrams of Speilberg.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This has been, by far, my most used app on my Kindle Fire. I find it very helpful to have so many translations available, and have really gotten a lot out of the devotional &amp; reading plans.

B0066W1AZK|5.0|See subject. The board is neat, and the game itself not very dumb, just enough not to humiliate you. Excellent for a few hours of leisure.

0547258305|4.0|Review for Graceling by Kristin Cashore;<br /><br />Graceling is a story of a girl named Katsa. Her Grace (a skill that someone is incredibly good at) is more of a curse for her because her Uncle, King Randa.. uses her grace as a weapon . Her job is to punish those that Randa has told her too, it order to benefit his wants and whims. Katsa believes her Grace is merely killing .. a bringer of death and pain , which means no one could possible want her for anything other than to bring fear. That all changes when she meets Po, he is Graced with fighting. throughout the story Katsa learns that there might be something more to her then just death and fear. Could she find life and love with the one person who can truly understand her and match her? This book really leaves you feeling that there is a perfect someone for everyone and just because someone has labeled you something like killer over and over doesn't make it so. This book was rich with back story and histories ,Kristin Cashore.. paints a beautiful landscape of literary wonder. my only complaint was that it left me wanting more .. left me wondering if there should more story. over all a nice 4 stars
B004EPYZV2|4.0|I am strangely discouraged from writing about the movies that I enjoy the most.  Take, for example, Mission Impossible:  Ghost Protocol.  Having witnessed the film in all of its innocent glory over two weeks ago, I almost gave up on the idea of writing a review for it.  Why?  I have no certain idea.  I suppose that, when it comes to the best, I'm hesitant to express an opinion that is anything but glowing.    Well, to stall any doubts, this is a glowing review of a terrific film.  And to think some people had doubts in the mastermind that is director Brad Bird.  Overseer of the Iron Giant, The Incredibles, and Ratatouille, director Bird is almost without equal when it comes to grace and pacing.  He is almost perfect.  Still, this was Bird's first attempt at a live-action film, and there were dangers.  Whelp, Bird took care of those quite easily.  Ghost Protocol shares the same whimsical air that all of Bird's magnificent films exude from start to finish; nothing about this film takes itself too seriously.  Predictably, that works for a film that deals with the \\"impossible\\".  Who would have thought?  Each set piece is mashed with a carefree humor that only Bird can properly execute, with dedicated actors Cruise and Renner following along with impeccable style and strenuous physical stunts.  Everyone's clearly on board, and it creates an atmosphere that is completely authentic and exciting.  Regarding Cruise:  Say what you will, but he was made for this role.  Handsome, energetic, and finding a perfect parity between humility and outrageous style, Mr. Ethan Hunt is the epitome of hip.  It's even more entertaining to see he and Brandt, Jeremy Renner's character, find equal footing as they pettily argue over matters.  Add the graceful Paula Patton and the always-exceptional Simon Pegg, and you'd be hard-pressed to find a more fitting cast for the best summer blockbuster of the year.  Overall, Ghost Protocol takes everything terrific about director J.J. Abrams' third iteration and initiates overdrive.  Nothing is ever stable and, occasionally, things get tangled into implausibility but, being a director of animation, Bird is so often confronted by the impossible that he had mastered the ability to overcome it.  As of now, there isn't a better family popcorn flick in theaters.

B002BU0DPE|1.0|I've bought this headset from Target a total of four times (with insurance so no cost to me the other times). These headphones have great sound quality and great mic quality, but they are flimsy and DO NOT last. For the money you pay, you could buy a cheaper, more reliable headset. My boyfriend has a 14 dollar headset I ordered off of Amazon and it's been working like a charm for over 6 months. I've had this brand of headset for 4 months, and every month I've had to take it back and have it replaced. I've only used them lightly, and the fact that they break so easily is ridiculous. The construction is not sturdy and the sound is more than likely the first thing to go out. I recommend not buying this at all. It is not a reliable headset in the least, and it is not worth the money you pay for it. It's has good quality sound and a good quality mic, but it is flimsy and breaks EASILY. There are plenty more reliable headsets at a lower price.

B005SJIP2S|4.0|Some fans will not call this verion the band Yes but don't believe them. This live double CD captures Yes at their best and proves that age has not wearied them - that much. Things have moved on since Yessongs but enjoy this current album none the less.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I would watch this movie over and over.  It is excellent and a lesson for everyone.  The acting was superb.  Definitely a must see.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoys playing solitaire when I was younger. This game feels the same. It provides a way to keep my mind engaged while watching TV. The only difference that I have found is that this game does not deal the remaining cards in 3s like I was taught. Enjoy the escape.
B000067J1Y|3.0|Upon watching this spoof on Top Gun, it was kinda funny but nothing I would have purchased.  I would have rented it once and called it good.  But now we own it so maybe the grandkids would like to see it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this game rocks!! best way to get time to fly by. I recommend this app for everyone who loves classic card games :)
B0014JKJJI|5.0|Very comfortable! ....and very ugly, however these shoes do run a bit big, so men? if your size 8 1/2 I would order a size 8 ...  no half size with these shoes!  they wear great!  made in mexico.. cheaply made, but I still like em! and would buy another pair...very good for back and feet pain! just add a little foot powder inside and it's a great feeling all day!

0439023521|5.0|I read all 3 books in the series together and recommeded the series to many people. I even had book club read it when I hosted. It is gripping & twist turning. Just when you think you know what will happen it changes and you would not have been able to predict it. I can't wait for the movie to come out!
B004HNTER6|1.0|We were unable to watch The DVD Senna because it's not an American version. Our DVD player will not except or play.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This app is one that I almost forget about because it just works. I don't do a lot of word processing or spreadsheets on my tablet or phone, but when I need to open a file and view the contents, this app works well and gets the job done.<br /><br />The ability to open view and edit office apps is a must have for me. This was the first android app I tried, and I looked no further.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Fast smooth movement during game play. Nice custom settings such as draw 1 or draw 3.  You can even change the design on the cards. The only downside is the small pop up nag screen to try other products, but only appears at the start of a new game.  Overall a great app.
B002ZG981E|4.0|a little confusing @ first but the story unfolds in the middle and gets really intense when they drive into more dreams within dreams.. good watch for the dreamers with an open mind.
B004EPYZXU|2.0|Just rented this PPV movie and should have read the reviews here more closely.  Supposedly true?  I highly doubt it and I am a big Sci-Fi fan.  Lunar spiders?  Give me a break!  If you are an ADD/ADHD teen, then this is for you.  Not for me.
B004ECDNJU|2.0|hard at first but got easier as I went it is decent I kinda like It but its just my kind of game
B005K0HDGE|3.0|i love uncle stevie but this book is over cooked. loved the first 50 percent but grew tired of the slow pace and never felt the power between jake and sadie despite the prolific sexual encounters. i felt annoyed that jake seemed more concerned near the end with his headache and goodies powder than sadie.  by the end i couldnt identify with jake and im a middle aged english teacher myself.  felt like i shoulda just reread the dead zone. in his book called on writing king suggests a writer should compose and cut out the bad parts essentially. well this puppy had lots that shoulda been cut im afraid. i hate cliches but sometimes less is more. also if im gonna read this many pages i want a great ending. didnt find one here.  simply a book about time travel with nothing new to offer.
B004A8ZWW4|2.0|I had high hopes for this movie since Hugh Jackman is the lead.  All the actors do well and the story, with some important exceptions, is well written.  The two reasons I did not like it are that first there is a scene where rodeo is depicted and the main plot point here is that Hugh Jackman's character's robot is going to fight a live bull!!  At this point in the movie (first 10 minutes or so) I almost got up to leave as I despise animal cruelty.  I stayed to see how far they were actually going to take that scene.  I know it is just a movie and no real bull was actually hurt making it, but seriously - this is supposed to be the future and a live animal fight is considered an OK and fun family activity (children are present in the rodeo scene)!!?! Not for me.  Second reason I did not like it is it is actually just a boxing movie with robots.  If you don't think boxing is fun to watch or care at all for any of the lifestyle involving with boxing, don't bother to see this.  Won't be buying the DVD or renting, especially due to depiction of live animal abuse.
B001I189MQ|4.0|I appreciate the batman movies but this one, and judging by the latest previews of the new one, continue on the path to being darker and darker and less appropriate for the kids who used to be able to watch these with their parents.
B0034JKZ86|5.0|The Princess and the Frog (Single-Disc Edition) is a Disney animated movie from 2009 and I sure liked it. The main character is Tiana who works as a waitress and has a dream to start a restaurant of her own. Along the way she has many adventures and is turned into a frog before she gets what she really wants. Which she does not know yet. The music is amazing and the animation is Classic Disney at its best. I loved every minute of it and so will you. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5.

1592400876|5.0|This book was recommended by my nephew, the English professor, for use by my son who is struggling with the writing section of the SAT. I decided to read it in advance and found it delightful. It explained areas of punctuation that I invariably get wrong in a clear yet entertaining fashion. It should hold by teenaged son's interest while teaching him the basics.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|gives a good variety, some easier than others.  control of some games can be difficult, like the spaceship and fish games.  having fun playing, like the challenges.
B006QPVH6O|3.0|As long as you don't go into this expecting a big-budget, IMAX sort of production, this is actually quite enjoyable.  The story is decent and pretty creepy most of the time.  The film is presented as if it's restored footage from an actual mission, and if you've ever seen some of that then you know we're not talking hi-def here.

0765322889|4.0|Did you ever want to go to Narnia? Middleearth? Philip Pullman's alternate multiverse? Entering the Empire of Malazan is like literally being transported to another world. All of the attendant confusion is intact.<br /><br />Imagine that you really did find yourself in another world. Who would you trust? How are these people related to each other and to the larger society? What is the history of the place? If the society is in conflict, which side do you ally? Reading Gardens of the Moon, like other reviewers have noted, is to enter another world and Erikson takes several hundred pages to fill you in on the details and all of the relationships. The Dramatis Personae and the Glossary and the Maps are required reading and orienting elements. This is not for everyone, but once you have a grasp on the world it is a magical world indeed.<br /><br />The Malazan Empire is conquering continents and peoples. The Malazan Empire is also beset with internal strife from both other factions that would rule and from conquered peoples chaffing under the tyranny. To add to the tension, the Gods have decided to become involved in sentient affairs. Not all of the peoples are human. The reader is set down in a battlefield late in the latest Imperial War. The characters are battle-hardened soldiers and mages, the veterans of many battles and many wars. The cast of characters rangers from the soldiers up through imperial advisors and everything in-between. The scale is huge and detailed - a wall sized tapestry and everything tells an intertwined story.<br /><br />About three hundred pages in, everything starts making sense and the relationships become clear. Until then, the reader is confused but the story and the writing are so good that this causes less frustration than one might think. Once the smog clears Gardens of the Moon becomes a fast-paced adventure. I am assured by other readers that subsequent volumes are even more magical and without the confusion. If you are a lover of epic fantasy I recommend perseverance as this journey is surely worth it.<br /><br />The writing style is clear, fluid and a more than a notch above the usual pulp fantasy offering. Characterizations are good but not psychologically detailed, but the world and the situations are so complex that I am in awe of the imagination and dedication the author had to create such a complex offering.<br /><br />I don't know if this book would work as an audiobook or a kindle book as the maps, glossary and dramatis personae appendices are so important in the first book, but perhaps audio readers can speak to this. I will be visiting Malazan often.erance as this journey is surely worth it.   The writing style is clear, fluid and a more than a notch above the usual pulp fantasy offering.

B0063IH60K|5.0|this app is super addicting I play it all the time its just like the real thing!!!! soooo worth a download!!!!
1594744769|5.0|Loved this book! Loved the old eccentric photos as well as the story.  It could be the next equivalent to a \\"Harry Potter\\" sort of series if Riggs is able to keep it up,and if you read it, you will WANT him to keep it up!!!  It's a bit dark and yet has a redeeming sort of light contained within it and an interesting basic premise.  Suitable for teens to adults.  I feel as if I have only just met the characters (peculiar children) within and hope more of their back stories will be revealed in the future!  The photos were gleaned from yard sales and the like and fit well within the story.  The visuals add to the interesting tone of the book.  I am hanging onto my copy and hope that soon, there will be a sequel for me to love as much as I enjoyed this book!
B004SJ3BCI|2.0|While the characters are cute, I am not a fan of the game itself. I got bored with it and deleted it after about five minutes of playing.
0061537969|2.0|I must first confess that I did not read the entire book. I couldn't. I found it too contrary to the way I feel about my own dogs. I read the first 5 chapters or so, and then the last two. That was enough to confirm my feelings.  I suppose I should commend the author for attempting to highlight the beautiful soul of a dog, but I think he got some things wrong. It seemed as if he was trying to justify human failings rather than portray a dog's feelings. We can never be certain how a dog feels, of course, but I don't agree with his portrayal.  Here were the things that I most disagreed with: 1) I would never euthanize my dog because it was the only way \\"I could be allowed to soar,\\" 2) I would never scold my dog for tearing up some stuffed animals after he was trapped in a house with no food or water for three days, and 3) I would never presume that the next highest attainment of life is \\"ascending\\" from being a dog to a man.  From the various reviews I've read, I can see I'm in the minority about this. But my respect and love for my dogs made it incredibly hard for me to tolerate this book.
B0063IH60K|4.0|love the game just wish there were more solitaire games to choose from.  very easy to play.  worth it to get it.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I have been using the reading plan, it is terrific.  Plus you get a choice of which translation to use.  The note function has also been helpful.  Overall, this app has been a fun tool and has enhanced my daily Bible reading on my Kindle.
B006N0YWGY|5.0|downloaded this on a whim as it was only a dollar and to my surprise this is actually a really fun game!
B0060ZJ74O|5.0|\\"Moneyball\\"  is the story of the Oakland A's general manager Billy Beane (Brad Pitt) and his then-unheard-of policy of relying on cold statistics to acquire players who could score runs.  With a budget that prevented the team from snagging acknowledged top talent and competing with the deep pockets of the Yankees and Red Sox, Beane teams up with the Harvard-educated economist Peter Brand (Jonah Hill) to rebuild the club and make it competitive.  This is an unusual baseball movie since most of it takes place off the field and images of actual play do not dominate.  Performances are terrific, from Pitt's rebellious Beane, bucking the accumulated wisdom of his scouts who rely on their instincts and the age and physical condition of players, to Jonah Hill, who departs from his goofy sidekick roles to take on an actual, believable character.  The scenes between Pitt and Hill are especially enjoyable.  They have great chemistry.  Philip Seymour Hoffman plays team manager Art Howe, a guy who clearly draws a line in the sand when it comes to game strategy and has little love or respect for Beane.      Sports films always face the problem of appealing to a wide audience, and casting Pitt in the lead role is certainly one way to lick the problem.  The script by Steve Zaillian and Aaron Sorkin takes us into the offices of a mid-level major league baseball team, underscoring the tensions, resentments, disappointments, and resistance to new ideas.  Those who think baseball is only a game will see that it is big business predicated on taking chances on players who are undervalued, past their prime, or injured.     A few scenes show Billy with his daughter (Kerris Dorsey) and ex-wife (Robin Wright), but they are incidental.  The movie really percolates when we see Billy working the phone with another general manager, trying to make the most advantageous deal, or when he has to move ahead with a method of team building that is contrary to the status quo.  \\"Moneyball\\" is available in a two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack.  Bonus extras include a blooper reel and featurettes on the real Billy Beane, drafting the team, playing the game, and adapting the original book into film. The movie is also available in single-disc Blu-ray and DVD editions.
006123141X|2.0|This is my first novel by Rollins.  I'm not sure why I finished reading it as I found myself repeatedly laughing at some of the story elements.  While it is obvious that the author does lots of research he often doesn't bother to come up with remotely plausible events (e.g. using bear whistles to stampede a pack of polar bears to the rescue against a squad of mercenaries).  Rollins doesn't bother filling new readers in on what the Guild is about.  It seems to have world-wide resources including helicopters, fighter jets and waves of assassins but no attempt is made to provide an explanation.<br /><br />Overall this book is a sort of Indiana Jones meets James Bond super villan story that assumes the reader can suspend disbelief no matter what the author writes. It's a very fast and easy read. I guess I kept reading to see how silly it could get.
B00664AM5C|4.0|\\"Contagion\\"  is a stark, realistic look at what happens when a new killer virus is discovered and the worldwide health and medical community rush to combat the disease before it takes an incomprehensible toll on human life.  Mitch Emhoff (Matt Damon) has just welcomed his wife, Beth (Gwyneth Paltrow), back from a business trip to Hong Kong.  She's feverish and weak, but these symptoms of flu turn out to signal something far more dangerous.    Other victims of this unknown affliction surface, word spreads, and Drs. Ellis Cheaver (Laurence Fishburne) and Erin Mears (Kate Winslet) of the Centers for Disease Control brainstorm to figure out the source of the virus.  Mears is hastily sent into the field to gather information while other researchers amp up their efforts to isolate the virus and develop a vaccine.  Among them are independent biologist Dr. Ian Sussman (Elliott Gould) and CDC Dr. Ally Hextall (Jennifer Ehle).  \\"Contagion\\" provides a credible look at what might happen if such a health threat came to pass, and has an almost documentary feel as multiple aspects of the story unfold in parallel time while locations shift from city to city, country to country.  Characters are well drawn; real people act heroically without making a big deal of it.  Yet despite its fine performances, the movie plays on a single emotional and dramatic note.  It moves along, unhurried and deliberate, as director Steven Soderbergh portrays a tense but generally disciplined populace.     \\"Contagion\\" provides a thoughtful spin on the Hollywood disaster flm.  Though the formula is borrowed from many 70's blockbusters, \\"Contagion\\" is far more reflective.  The two-disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo Pack contains a Digital Copy, a mini-documentary of how a virus changes the world, and two featurettes.  The movie is also available in single-disc Blu-ray and DVD editions.
0545403359|5.0|This is a well written book for older kids, teens or adults. It is told from the point of view of a war horse. The author can easily put forth his message of the futility of war,by having Joey (the horse) narrate the story. The horse clearly lives in the present (in the moment) and is free of prejudice or stereotyped pre-conceived notions. When looking at war from day to day or moment to moment, of opposing sides, instead of the \\"big picture\\" the author clearly shows that the \\"big picture\\" doesn't or hardly matters when examining the realities of war. The absurdities of those doing the actual fighting of the war (literally those in the trenches)is seen via the innocence of a horse who understands and truly relishes his relationships with humans & other horses, without knowing or trying to know a \\"bigger picture\\".   I am not antiwar. In fact I am truly appreciative of our military & the many sacrifices they have & do make for the benefit of our country. I am simply stating the message that I got from the book. It was the showing of the dichotomy between the ideologies of people in power making decisions, and the reality of the people that actually make it happen. The author assumes the reader brings some knowledge of the former with him/her , and the horse takes us through the latter.
B0063GORYU|5.0|If you like card games you must have this one. Of the ones I have downloaded for my Kindle Fire is my favourite.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|An amazingly helpful tool to read on my Kindle Fire and it's not even a book!  I love the availability of the many different versions to choose from.  And the Bible reading plans are a great asset.  You have to check this one out.  It could be a life-changing experience for you!
B005DOL0R0|5.0|I received this cover as a gift for my Kindle Fire which was also a gift. I do have to say it ruined the surprise because I opened the package the cover was in before I opened the Fire but I really can't blame that on the cover! It does exactly what it is supposed to do, it is lightweight and has no odor that I have detected. I must admit that I have ordered another cover, one with an easel type of feature that will be nice to keep the Fire tilted at just the right angle. But I like this one for nice  all-around protection for when the kindle is not in use or is being transported.
B004PAHZMC|5.0|This was perfect for my 4 year old nephew that loves Legos and Star Wars.  He can now easily carry his toys from Mom and Dad's to Grammy and Papa's and anywhere else he wants to and have a place to play with them when he gets there, too.  The case came folded in a plastic container and was simple to change it from a flat play mat to the carry case.  It has a zipper on either end, a velcro flap, and a handle on top.  I am not sure of the material so I am not sure of the durability.  I will see how well it lasts and try and post an update.

It is very similar to the ipad covers that are out there.  I switched to the leather cover once it finally arrived....but ended up going back to this cover after a week.  It's so light and much easier to tuck into my purse...the leather cover is much bulkier.  I've been very happy with my purchase of this cover and highly recommend it!

B0000A02U2|5.0|Got for daughter to \\"prepare\\" for college. Ha  Still funny all these years later. Forgot about some of the more crude scenes that were cut from tv version. But certainly not as rough as R movies today.
1591843790|4.0|In the beginning of the book I almost put it down to never finish it. It starts out with the very basics that someone leaving college and going to their first job interview needs to learn. However, as the book progressed, there are some good fundamentals of persuasion that are mostly highlights from some of the popular books with Guy's own twist to it. If you're well read in marketing, sales, and persuasion, you won't get much new from this book, but there are enough little tidbits to certainly make it worth your small investment of time and money. Not the first book I'd pick, but should be on your list to read.
B004ECDNJU|5.0|love this game.  I had no problems on Thrive tablet. I like that you can control speed. I almost didn't download because of not so good reviews, glad I did, so download and Enjoy!
0307949486|5.0|I bought this only after seeing how popular it was and was shocked. I did not know what to expect.<br /><br />This is a dark murder mystery and I'm shocked by the vivid and horrific sexual detail in a book and surprised the book has become mainstream.<br /><br />This book is a page turner and one of the best murder mysteries I've read, but be prepared, it covers some of the terrible things that only police detectives see over and over.

B004LW8C0I|4.0|Well, I finally got around to playing this DVD .  And... it worked.   I was worried because   while I had no knowledge of this,   the DVD came from a seller in Thailand.   Amazon.com needs to reveal more info about the Seller,   in order to prevent un-due customer anxiety.   Nevertheless, the DVD worked fine after I changed the language and etc. settings.   What I bought was : Searching for Bobby Ficher Movie DVD .  B.Oz.
B002ZG98UA|4.0|If you like zombie movies (as I do), then you will enjoy this movie.  I am a fan of the Resident Evil movie franchise so I may be a little biased, but if your a looking for a fun, fast-paced action movie then this is for you.  There are lots of things getting shot and getting blown up, especially in the opening scene.  There are some returning characters from previous Resident Evil movies.  My only minor beef with this movie is that it blatantly rips off the Matrix both with costumes and fighting moves.  If you are looking for quality cinema that will be appearing on TCM for generations to come, this is not for you.  If you just want to watch a fun movie with zombies and be entertained for a while, this is a good choice.
B0063GORYU|4.0|The game is fun, seems to run well, and doesn't shut down unexpectedly. Some minor recognition issues, but overall a good game.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|This app is really fun to play. I don't get why there are so many bad reviews. The games may be hard to beat sometimes, but that makes it all the better to have a little challenge in your life. BUY THIS APP!!!!!!!!!
0393064476|1.0|The book is an interesting review of many topics within the context of the Medival and Renaissance world. The leap to the beginning of modern thought from one source is simply a fiction designed by the author to make a point he couldn't make outside of a fiction book. Shades of the Da Vinci code.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Easy to play and fun for all ages! My 5 yr old plays just as much as I do. I could play it for hours!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|The Title says it all. This is actually a great Blu-Ray release. It has TONS of great special features, amazing packaging, and above all, the films look amazing in high definition!!! Yeah, many of the changes can throw you off a bit, but the changes are actually not that bad (in my opinion). To me, this is a great release. If you ignore all the 1 star ratings and all the changes everyone backstabs, you should definitely pick it up. You may find it more amusing than what you give it credit for. May the force be with you!
B005URRCUY|5.0|I pre-ordered this album and forgot I had done so until it showed up in my mailbox just two days after the album came out. I love the album; I listened to it for a week straight after it arrived.

0060873086|2.0|I love Michael Crichton at his best. I love Richard Preston at his best.   Micro was TERRIBLE. How could this be possible?  I'm not sure who's to blame. While Crichton's post JP novels have ranged from pretty good (Timeline) to pretty mediocre (anyone out there re-reading Airframe?) to mostly terrible (Next, Lost World, State of Fear), I have to admit, Pirate Latitudes actually won me over. I'm not sure how much of it was Crichton's and how much was a ghost author's, but it ultimately felt like, say, a second draft or so of The Great Train Robbery. And I'll definitely take a second draft over nothing.   But Micro...Micro doesn't even feel like an early outline. It feels like an imitation of Crichton, what a high school student might churn out after first coming across Jurassic Park.  In a nutshell, the story concerns a group of scientists who are inadvertently shrunk and left to die in the jungles of Hawaii. Using only their knowledge of the \\"microworld,\\" they must return to the lab while avoiding deadly insects and a psychopathic corporate crony bent on killing them.   There came a moment where I realized that, had anyone else's name been on the cover, I would have immediately thrown the book across the room. Specifically, one of the microhumans is flying around in a microplane and happens to buzz by the balcony of an apartment. There, a man happens to be undressing a woman, and the microhuman happens to fly close enough to observe her \\"six foot nipple.\\" Haha, what??   In hindsight, I should have thrown the book across the room long before this.   Crichton's most magical quality was in how he'd take fantastical concepts (cloned dinosaurs, time travel, etc.) and apply a bit of science to make them suddenly seem possible. Sadly, this element is completely lacking in Micro - the unbelievable mounts from the very beginning, when the most lackluster explanation for the shrinking machine is given: electromagnetic fields! Ha, was this stolen from an episode of Lost? Worse, the way to enlarge a shrunken person is literally given a single sentence: \\"Reverse the process.\\" Uh, not sure how you, er, reverse the process of bombarding someone with EM fields, but um...  Beyond the science, the plotting is absolutely terrible. Beyond terrible. Something happens about midway through the book to the protagonist that is just unbelievably bad. It amounts to nothing, it causes nothing to happen, it has no symbolism, and you start wondering why the hell this guy was the main character to begin with.   In addition, the characters are awful, from the paper thin scientists to an evil villain with about the same motivation as a bad guy in a He-man cartoon. Crichton always includes the jerk character in his books, who'll ultimately get his punishment. This book indeed starts off with a single jerk. Then, a second jerk appears. Huh. Strange. By 3/4th of the book, you'll realize why a second jerk was added, which compounds the horrible plot and protagonist problems...what a mess. Worse, nothing anyone does makes any sense, from a moonlit naked swim in a puddle of water to the worst scientist assassination plot of all time to the most fumbled romantic subplot I've read in years.   Though pretty much all of it sucks, ultimately, what kills the book is that you don't feel like ANY of this is possible, and that you're barely one grade above those Magic School Bus books, where the kids all shrink down and look at the wonders of nature. It really is that magical element, the ability to suspend disbelief as an adult, that is absolutely necessary - and completely non-existent.   So who's to blame? Crichton? Preston, who I think is a fantastic non-fiction writer, and who's tone I assumed would perfectly match Crichton's?   Honestly, there's simply no way Preston could be this bad an author. Events and characters are so thinly written and badly plotted that it almost feels like he was being forced to follow a horrible outline, perhaps one found deep in the bowelsof Crichton's computer...That, rather than let Preston clean up the half-baked ideas and fix the major story issues, he had to follow it like it was the Bible handwritten by God.   If this is the case, it's really too bad, as there IS a story in here worth telling. Rare moments shine when the micro world is portrayed as an extra-terrestrial universe, and when you come across these inspired passages, you'll find yourself thinking \\"Hey, this could actually come together into something great!\\"  And then the six foot nipples make an appearance.
0439023521|5.0|This was a GREAT book. So different than other books. It was a page-turner from beginning to end, keeping me interested and engaged with the characters. I can't wait to read the next two books, as well as see the movie. Great read!!
B0063IH60K|3.0|Game is not that challenging.  I'm not the greatest solitaire player but I win at least 3/4's of the time.
0486284735|5.0|This book was in amazing condition. I bought it Like New and it looked like it hadn't been handled at all, something I could have purchased at the store. The package was delivered way before expectancy, as well.
0553103547|5.0|I felt the need to post my five-star opinion of this, the first book in GRRMs series, A Song of Ice and Fire. Hooked from the first page, the first chapter, the action never lets up in this amazing work of art. HBO has made this book famous, but HBO cannot possibly deliver the detail that is described in this book. Enter another world with Game of Thrones - a world you won't want to leave.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I will admit that I got slightly bored during the middle of this book. However, in the end, I think it was perfect. The story is sad, real and romantic. There are times that I wanted to scream at what happened and there were times when I had to put the book down to get a tissue to wipe away the tears. It doesn't end in a happily ever after sense but it ends just the way I had hoped for from the very beginning.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like the variety. Some of the games could be better, but there are alot to choose from. So, if you don't like a game you can go to another.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|its ok but I'm doing it for the money but ok so do not down load it so thats fine
B00597A6NU|5.0|I saw this movie in theaters when I was a kid and loved it. I just re-watched this and was a bit worried going into it seeing as how most media I revisit from my childhood doesn't seem to hold its magic. I'm happy to say that Memphis Belle is still outstanding and I highly recomend it. My grandfather was a tailgunner in a Navy Avenger to this movie does envoke some deeper feelings for me. Plus Harry Connick Jr. has a small singing moment which is outstanding. If you like war films please give Memphis Belle a watch.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|kinda gay its okay but it was definetly wasn't what I was expecting. but there are some good things like some games are fun but a lot of them not very good

0143119788|4.0|Cold war-era spy story not meant for short-attention spans or those looking for quick reads and action-packed thrills. Low-key suspense building up like a chess game requires concentration and close attention to detail. Unglamorous characters whose commonplace life concerns inevitably go along for the ride as they pursue the cat-and-mouse game of finding the mole add considerable complexity and depth to the story. Personal betrayals unfold along with the treason in this intelligent, elegantly written, British espionage adventure.
B00475AYJQ|3.0|(no spoilers here...)  Imagine about 1/3 of this book being a pretty straight line... and then suddenly the pen gets smacked off into this big random looping arc... then just when it looks like it's about to get back on track again... SMACK!  Another big arc off the first one... and then... SMACK!  Another!  I was literally commenting to my friend (who had read the whole book before me) that this was probably one of the best fantasy books I had ever read... the characters are very easy to connect with, the characters interact well, the story is interesting, etc.  Then I hit somewhere around the 1/3-1/2 way point and everything spun wildly out of control.  I get the strong impression that the author realized he was already into his second book and was nowhere near 2/3s of the way through his story and panicked.  He then sent him off on various adventures that took 30-75 pages, that honestly should have each been a book of their own.  It's still an interesting read, but it does become a rather jarring experience and it winds up leaving you with a lot of \\"well, then why the heck would he do THAT?\\" type of questions when you're done.  Very unfortunate.  Still worth reading, but really frustrating.  Oh... I also think the author has essentially no clue how an obviously capable, intelligent and charming 16 year old boy would handle women, because Kvothe's interactions are nothing even close to reality on this front throughout both books.  Also somewhat irksome, though really not too much worse than a head-scratcher overall.
B0015DROBO|5.0|Original, interesting, dark, complex, and fascinating.  These are just a few of the words to describe this incredible book.  I'm currently reading the third in the series and I am just as impressed.  It's a shame the author passed away before seeing his work in the hands of millions.  I would've read 20 in the series if they were available.
B005ZHBA9I|5.0|When I heard that Carter Burwell was doing the score for Breaking Dawn I was totally thrilled. The score in Twilight was really the first thing that drew me to the Twilight saga. Carter starts out by bringing you into a kind of forbiding and dark place with the opening music.Then with Bella's Lullaby he takes you soaring to an unbelievably beautiful scene sharing the emotions of Bella and Edwards love for one another. Now in Breaking Dawn he has done another incredible score relating the emotions of the film in his beautiful music. I just ordered the CD but I've seen the movie four times and each time I have grown to love his music even more. I would say that  Love,Death,Birth or Bella's Rebirth is my favorite because he used Bella's Lullaby in it during the memory scenes and it just brings back all the emotions from the very beginning of the saga up until Bella's transformation. In my opinon the decision to bring Carter Burwell back for Breaking Dawn was an excellent choice!

B001LF347E|5.0|I saw this show online before it started airing on BBC America. I've seen all 4 seasons and can't wait for the next. After the first episode, I was instantly hooked. The show is about The wizard Merlin at a young age (late teens, early 20's). Set in a time when magic is outlawed in Camelot, Merlin's magical abilities have to be kept secret from everyone. The story follows Merlin as well as other main characters (Prince Arthur, who is not yet king for example, as well as Lancelot and others). The show is appropriate for all ages (though some small children may get scared of some of the creatures (it's no scarier than Harry Potter). Each episode has a plot which usually includes Knights, Dragons, Witches, and of course Magic, and contributes to the main story line. The show is family friendly, includes episodes which are about different things and includes drama, friendship, romance, and a few that are hilarious. My Fiancee and I love this show. For those who have seen movies based on King Arthur or read literature, know that the show has it's own different version of re- telling the story, yet it's very enjoyable. A few visual/special effects are not the best in the world like the big office box movies(since it's doubtful they get a huge budget for those things), but the effects are pretty good for a tv show, realistic enough, gets better with each season and doesn't at all take away from the creativity, plots and story. I will be getting seasons 2,3 and 4 as well. The only negative is that I wish there were more episodes for each season (Each episode is about 45 min long and each season has 13 episodes), not enough in my opinion, especially since they're all so good.  No complaints on the shipping/packaging or the actual product. It arrived in a timely manner in Brand New Condition.

Many free apps that I download usually get uninstalled very quickly....not angry birds! Great way to pass some time. The game is fun and very addicting.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Good free game. It did freeze one time but a quick reset fixed the issue. It's a basic version but still fun.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game is a fun and quick way to pass some time. Its not too difficult and its all about beating your previous score.

B005ZUR724|5.0|Goregous graphics on a smaller scale, Animation sounds could use a touch up, But other then that the sound is just as goregous. Ignore the low score this game has, As alot of the downrates are over a technical malufunction that was of no fault to the game or its producers. 10/10! A must have for the gamers that racked up a kindle fire (or decent to high grade tablet) this year!
B003MC5N28|5.0|I first read the giver in my seventh grade English class. I loved the book. Many kids in my class didn't like the book for the same reasons many reviews didn't. While the book itself didn't end in a great way The Messenger and Gathering Blue fill the void of anything that may be missing to some. If you feel something missing then I recommend you read the prior books mentioned.
B0050SYS5A|5.0|We have a very odd room with our tv set, it is 15 feet long by 10 feet wide. We have the tv / couch combo in the 10 foot wide section.  Xbox says that you only need 6' of space for one player and 8' for 2.  This is not the case.  More like 8 and 10.  The zoom allows us to play in the 8' section with 2 players.  Although, it is MUCH better if we just have one.  I would highly recomend this for almost anyone who has or is thinking about getting an Xbox with a Kinect.  This also helps the Kinect reconize my 9 year old much better than with out the Zoom.  It is much better price wise to buy on Amazon.com, $20 versus the $30 at Target, and all local stores.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This product is small, compact, and very effective. If you understand the difference between the carbide and ceramic, you'll have no trouble getting an effective edge on your blades. The only qualm I have with this product is that you have very little choice as to the angle and steepness of the edge. On a standard whetstone, you choose how much of an angle you place on the blade. On this device, though simple and easy to use, by placing the blade into the slot, you are given a preset steepness. This is fine for most people, but sometimes I prefer a much thinner edge, which this device does not provide. Otherwise, perfect.

0817439390|4.0|As a fairly new photographer and an avid reader, I have purchased a number of books over the past few months.   This particular book has had a huge impact on my confidence to go away from the \\"snapshot\\" settings of my camera and to become a M (Manual) shooter.  Thoroughly recommended.
1419701533|5.0|Great book set......Sturdy hard cover set in nice box!  Got this for my son for the holidays and he loves it......He keeps all the books in the box it came in and brings the books to school to read in his spare time.  he wanted the soft cover set of this (which by the way I was told by Barnes and Noble they do not make, and you can usually only get the soft cover of these books through the school book order clubs like scholastic - so don't go crazy like I did running to ten book stores to find!)  But after getting this he sees how much better hard cover books are and much longer they will last!  Best price for this set too was through Amazon!
B000LGZHDS|5.0|Got this item for a Gary the Snail fan of Sponge Bob. They loved it and collectible! Came beautifully packaged and even wrapped in heart tissue paper! Very pleased!

B0063IH60K|4.0|This version is very clever. The only improvement I would suggest is a notification when the game is over -- I.e., no more moves possible.
B005OK725M|5.0|Forget what the critics have to say.  What do they know?  This is a fun movie, or at least I thought so.  Good soundtrack and good editing.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|There can be no 'spoiler alerts' as these movies are quite old by now so let's focus on both the Audio and Video quality.  I have the original SD trilogy with DTS audio and now the Blu Ray.  Audio for all 3 blu ray dvds is DTS 7.1 which when played on a fairly high end 5.1 system sounded grand.  There is excellent use of the appropriate surrounds on all 3 discs and with each film in chronological order, the audio actually seems to improve.  This is not to say that it is poor for the original.  Remember that the T Rex thumping with the water ripples showing was always used as a demo clip for selling speaker systems as well as it should be.  It will provide good feedback as to how your sub woofer performs.  Does it sound natural or artificial,  on my Velodine Sub, the deep bass was ever there.  I hate to say it as the 3rd movie, Jurassic Park 111 was the weakest film due in great part to its short length and ultra quick and unrealistic finale, but the audio was outstanding.<br />The video on all 3 films displayed no artifacting, stair stepping or grain noise that I could see.  The colors were well saturated and, even in the deep shadows, detail remained strong.  The only thing I was disappointed with was the lack of deleted scenes.  There were 2 for the 2nd movie and that was about it.  The other extras, for the most part, could all be found on the SD Trilogy I own.<br />Bottom line.....Yes, I would certainly recommend the blu ray collection, especially if you don't already have it.<br /><br />Update: Inclusive of the trilogy is a certificate enabling you to download a Jurassic Park game.  However, when going to the url suggested, it brings you to a Facebook page that says the game is coming in 2012.  Guess it is not ready to be sparse d out yet.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.<br />Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanksour purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks

B000P12LWY|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my husband who is a big history nut. I read the reviews which claimed this series was very factual and close to what actually happened back then. Personally, I did not care for the series, but got some mighty good sleep while he watched it. He liked it, so that's what counts. This item was received in a timely manner, well packaged, as described.
0316067938|5.0|I bought this book a long time ago for me when it first came out and I loved it. so when I found out that my cousin was reading them and needed this one I got on Amazon and sent it to her for christmas..she loves it! I would love to see more on this story from the author as I think it was a great read. she brought the story to life for me and I love how books do that. I couldn't put the book down and every time I did I ended up picking back up in just a few seconds after putting it down. if you love vampires and wolves and romance..then this is the book for you

B004QZ9PLU|1.0|The book mostly kept my interest but overall it was a depressing story. I have read several other Nicholas Sparks and felt this was somewhat predictable and at times slow moving. Unless you are a huge Nicholas Sparks fan and love everything he writes I would not recommend this one.

B005JLN9ZI|4.0|Truth be known I tend to be one of hip-hop's biggest critics. Which is strange since I have very little experience with what's going on within the culture itself. So all I can really do is deal with it within the music world as a whole rather than on it's own terms. As a rapper Drake more or less came out of nowhere last year with his debut [[ASIN:B003K1ZF2O Thank Me Later]],which I heard of but never heard. Also this is an album that I purchased for a very unusual reason. After it came out I was at my local record store and saw this cover with this man sitting in a corner,staring reflectively into a gold chalice,surrounded by other works of art. I had this strange urge to hear it. I was curious if the album cover in some way reflected the music contained within. Shallow? Perhaps. But also coming from the perspective of being a photographer and painter who often does so while listening to(and experiencing) music. So that is what I did today. Painted and listened to this album. And I must say,if your one of those people like me buying this album mainly because the cover caught your eye because of the pose,you'd actually be onto something with that.<br /><br />  Aubrey \\"Drake\\" Graham has a lot of qualities that remind me of R.Kelly. He exists in a world of creative conflicts. There's the musical conflict regarding himself as both a talented rapper and singer. And there's the conceptual conflict between his analytical reflections on romance and modern femininity to his need to keep up with the \\"pimp/play\\" persona handsome young hip-hoppers such as himself feel they must live up to. Also there's the slightly different conflict of being Canadian and an actor too. All of these things play into this album. Musically it's quite interesting,based largely around some beautifully arranged piano melodies and some pretty tasteful electronic orchestration. One little star deducting flaw for me is his unfortunate tendency to lapse a bit much into the four letter word cliche. What makes it workable is the fact that on especially on songs such as the cheeky \\"HYFR\\" (sure you all know what that stands for),\\"Cameras\\" and \\"Make Me Proud\\" those same words actually make sense. With songs such as \\"Marvin's Room\\" starting out more orchestral and getting a funky groove on with a second half,some of these songs start one way and end another. And are rather long for hip-hop too. A couple 6-8 minutes.<br /><br />  One of the best songs here is the title song with Rihanna,which starts out like a stuttering sophistifunk bass/guitar intro and has a somewhat Afro Cuban percussion bridge. Drake is contending with a lot on this album. Between contradictory woman (to which all of this albums \\"sexist\\" language is directed) who cannot seem to deal with their struggles of wanting to be sexually free agents and being emotionally independent. And as he keeps reminding them in many ways,both men and women have to give up just a little bit of themselves in the physical department. Otherwise it's just as self centered as chauvinism. So this is a very explicit album (just as the alost required tipper sticker suggests) but language aside isn't afraid to intellectually analyze what goes on between the sheets. Honestly I'd feel it would be a five star album if some of the language were cut...oh about in half. But it points to the struggle. Hip-hop in the last year or so has been edging out of it's lewd,posturing and still often violent stereotypes,even outside the the genre's conscious/political end. And this reflects that very strongly. You have a lot of changes happening here. He's got a chip on his shoulder towards immature women,but also shows his love for other ladies as well. He raps with great skill but is developing his singing talents as well. The beats are bumping and funky. But the melodies and music are also very strong. Again,have to say it: 2011 showed that hip-hip was at the very least moving forward. Exactly where it goes? Well albums such as this and the newests offerings from The Roots and Common show there are many excellent and vital directions. Happy journey!The Roots and Common show there are many excellent and vital directions. Happy journey!

B0050R0XEG|5.0|When i ordered it i wasn't sure if i was going to be happy, blown away, or disappointed. And gosh, i was totally blown away, who thought you could make this model with only 1,300 pieces. The build was slow and quite challenging, it took me around 3 hours (with a break very once in a while) to build this set. The detailing on this is outstanding! You can look at all of the pictures, zoom, watch the movie and you've barely scratched the surface of this van. I don't want to ruin all of the details for you guys but some of my Favorite details are, the roof rack, which is perfect, the gas cap, the closet with the shirt \\"make Lego models, not war\\" hanging in it, so you can see it in the window & the engine,which is probably my favorite part of the Camper. This is such a great set, but there is, of course, always room for improvement. There are some small things that could have been better. First the roof, which is not very sturdy. (but the canvas is great!) Second, the doors could be better. And Stickers, come on Lego, i don't mind stickers to much, but for the VW sign, now thats just wrong. And for those of us who are perfectionists, the engine looks like a V4 not a FLAT 4. And one last thing that is NOT bad about it, but could have been cool, is if the wheels steered, or even just instructions on how to put a steering mechanism in there. Unfortunately they don't steer so you can really only drive it strait.:) But besides those small downs, i have to say it is just.......AWESOME!!
B0063IH60K|4.0|Its a great game not too exciting. The best part is having the game when bored like in the waiting room of a dre office.
1401229921|5.0|Honestly, I wouldn't if those two topics did not peak your interest, fortunately for me, I am both. Hush is what got me back into comics and Jim Lee's art is beyond beautiful to me.  I don't understand why they kept the bubbles and the narration colored because it does distract a bit from the pages.  It gives a huge contrast to the majority of the page, which are in black and white pencil and then you have these huge colored letters in the background. You don't buy a book like this to read the story, you buy it so you can see how the story came together and to look at the art.  A great coffee table book, and a great idea by DC, it goes to show how popular the Hush story must be, because this is the first and only book released like this (to my knowledge).  I would not mind seeing other versions of a series like this, perhaps Long Halloween, GL Rebirth or All Star Superman.
1451648537|4.0|Not knowing much about his life, after reading his bio, I was delighted when I started seeing the evolution of his work. He was a true genius, he was a hard negotiator and he lived with a purpose.<br /><br />There might be better books on his life, Isaacson's is a chronology with no much depth on the days after the Apple 2. Worth reading if you don't know much about his path on life and want to appreciate his work as a truly piece of art.\\"

0316077046|2.0|Beautiful Darkness is a disappointing second installment to what was a promising series. I adored Beautiful Creatures where I was introduced to a Gothic and lush southern town with a heartbeat and pulse all its own - and a creepy, imaginative underworld lying beneath, just waiting to be discovered. I found Ethan to be a welcome change from typical YA male protagonists and seeing the story through his eyes was like a breath of fresh air. The main characters in Beautiful Creatures were lovingly drawn; in Beautiful Darkness, they were practically forgotten.   It took me a while to get through this massive novel. I actually put it down for weeks at a time. But lo-and-behold, I finished it. A lot of fat could have been trimmed. And way too many words were wasted on cliches. Oh, the cliches! I would need more hands to count off all the cliches thrown into this novel. Lena grieved for Macon by acting rebelliously. Lena met a super hot guy and started treating Ethan like crap. Ethan pined for Lena. And then the sidekicks... Link and Ridley, both desperately and repetitively described as punk-Goth, remained underdeveloped as characters despite an increased presence in the narrative. And clothes were continuously described...torn shirts held together with safety pins, punk-rock t-shirts, super tiny skirts and knee-high stockings... So many words wasted...  I was bored with this novel, but it does pick up a lot in the latter half, making it readable from that point forward. Nothing seemed to really happen till the very end and I feel strongly that the authors could have found a quicker route to the action. Simply put, I'm not really sure what happened in this novel or what was achieved or why it was important. There was such a lack of cohesion and direction throughout the middle of the novel that I felt at times like I was reading random journal entries written by a man on a LSD trip. I was bothered that there were no rules or limitations. Any good sci-fi, fantasy or supernatural story abides by an unspoken rule: There must be rules and limitations. The Dystopian Society of the Future will punish the protagonist when he breaks said rule. The super-human Vampire goes up in flame when caught in the sun and therefore cannot save her beloved from his midday execution. Rules and limitations make for juicy, page-turning conflict. This is totally absent from Beautiful Darkness. The Casters have no limits to their power. They seem to have no rules governing their underworld \\"society.\\" And when the protagonists are confronted with dangerous conflict, it is resolved quickly and easily by some random plot addition. That is poor storytelling.   And that leads to my ultimate disappointment. All of this could have [most likely] been avoided if Beautiful Darkness had focused on the one thing I thought it would - thoroughly delving into the Caster world and allowing the reader to explore the underworld of Casters hidden beneath the streets of Gatlin. The authors also lost sight of the ultimate conflict presented in the first book - the fact that Ethan and Lena can't really be together because they can't even touch. That was one of many loose ends left frayed or untouched in this installment. Perhaps the loose ends will be tied up in the third novel, which I'm not excited about. I actually started Beautiful Chaos over Thanksgiving. It reads much the same as Beautiful Darkness. I haven't opened it again since. 1.5 stars

0783229526|1.0|I started watching this movie and kept telling myself (and really hoping) that it was eventually going to build a plot or storyline. It never did and ended up being a horrible waste of 2 hours. I would not recommend this movie to my worst enemy. It is a horrible waste of time. Don't waste yours. I would have given it zero stars if I could have.
B004ZG5EYC|4.0|I love the movie and have no issue with the picture quality.  But there are TONS of previews before the movie starts.  It plays previews for MINUTES before you could get to the main menu.  It is very annoying when you play it the second time or after.
B004FOA84A|4.0|This is a classic point and click puzzle/adventure game. As other reviews pointed out, it is quite short. But it's also very cheap and I had a blast with it. Nice medium difficulty; a few puzzling moments<br />but no ridiculous or obtuse solutions. I look forward to more titles like this.
B004LUS390|5.0|only got it yesterday, but works well on my Kindle Fire. I'm using it with an elago Stylus Pen (with Clip for iPhone 4/3GS/3G, iPad and iPod Touch, AT&T and Verizon iPhone 4, Galaxy S and Galaxy Tab)  and it works fine. Doesn't seem to be scratching the glass surface at all from what I can tell. I have the full version on Mac which is why I was interested in this. It does lack enough instructions. I didn't watch the initial tour video and now can't figure out how to see it again, though. I am hoping to find some online videos to fill in what I'm missing.   It's definitely worth the money!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Been a fan of Angry Birds and this app works great on my kindle fire! Downloaded easily and fun to play......plus its free!
B004DLPXAO|1.0|Hmmm, was really looking to purchasing lots of books - I'm an avid reader. Sadly despite Amazon allowing me to install the App on my new 'shiny new tablet', I can't get any books :-(    Apparently downloads for androids (free or paid) are not available in the UK (basically anywhere outside the US). Perhaps this should be obvious before I wasted time downloading it? I'm not impressed.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is an awesome app!  I have it on my computer, Kindle Fire and Android phone.  The sync feature works flawlessly between all 3.  I used it for Christmas lists, and I use it for shopping lists and other reminders. Its great for having information right at my fingertips no matter what device I'm on.
B00028HBKM|5.0|Ok, so the world can rate this movie however they want. Rate it cause its too gory or too violent. Or maybe you think the acting sucked or you don't believe in Jesus or think its stupid or this and that and etc...but man I tell ya, if you have a deep relationship with God, (Yahweh), then you will love this movie. This movie...its just...THE GREATEST Jesus movie. I can't describe the imagery and impact of this movie. Even some non-believers will love it due to its creativity and view.<br /><br />But all in all, what a great movie to show Jesus' love for the world. He bleed for us all, and He rose again with all Power in His hands! Hallelujah! :)
B0000029GA|5.0|this is possibly the greatest album ever. nas exhibits his terrific lyrical skills and combines interesting rhymes with vivid descriptions of street life, behind creative beats.
0385737955|4.0|If you took a story like Lord of the Flies and placed it into a complex dystopian world full of danger, mystery and suspense you'd get The Maze Runner. This book has a fast moving plot that holds a lot of questions and reveals little answers. Normally I don't like being kept in the dark when I'm reading a book, but James Dashner's writing style was thrilling and the \\"not knowing\\" is what I found to be most intriguing with this story.<br /><br />There's a cast of fascinating characters in The Maze Runner. The story follows Thomas, the main character who seems connected to the maze some how, doesn't seem to remember anything about it, or how he got there. What I admired most about Thomas is his courage and bravery, which quickly allows him to be an example to the other guys he's there with. There's also plenty of suspicions about who he is and why he's here. No one has ever entered their world, and been able to accomplish what Thomas does so quickly, which deepens the mystery surrounding him and his purpose there.<br /><br />The Maze Runner's world is complex, deadly, and totally fascinating. I'm in awe over the cast of characters who have learned to survive in this world. Made up of mostly boys, these guys have learned how to survive amid all the odds stacked against them. They're smart, resourceful, fearless, and when faced with a life or death situation they manage to keep their cool (for the most part). Things are shaken up a bit with the arrival of Teresa, the only girl to ever enter this world. I definitely wasn't excepting her shocking role in this story. Throw in some deadly and completely freaky Grievers who I swear are some of the freakiest things I've read about, and you'll have your gory scenes. Sounds enticing doesn't it? It was to me, because I couldn't put this book down once I started it. I needed answers!<br /><br />Wow, the plot twists that are revealed towards the end of the book are shocking to say the least. I didn't see those coming at all, and I'm ready for more! My only compliant is how abruptly the story ends, which leads me to believe the series will pick up exactly where this book ends. I think this is a book that even the more reluctant male reader will enjoy. There's plenty of thrilling action, suspense, mystery and of course a little bit of gore. This is a book I'd recommend picking up for reading 12 yrs & older.'m ready for more!

0385738765|5.0|Talk about a sequel that picks up right where the first book in the series leaves off. I went from finishing The Maze Runner right into The Scorch Trials, and boy was I naive in thinking James would give me a moment to catch by breath and let my heart rate slow down a bit. James Dashner doesn't shy away from throwing readers right back into this series' dangerous, thrilling, intense world. Instead of maze this time, it's a scorched world and wow do the twists in this series keep on coming.<br /><br />Unlike The Maze Runner, The Scorch Trials is set in a land that's barren, dry, and really could be defined as hell. This land is void of anything beautiful and good. Living in this land are savage people who have been infected with a disease called the Flare. Here's the thing that James Dashner does with this series, he introduces you to people who you'd normal despise, but in a twisted way he makes you fell sympathy for them, when normally that would be the last thing you'd want to do. Case in point, The Cranks. The innocent people who've been infected and basically banished to live in this horrid condition. That's the thing that got to me, the fact that they were forced to become something they're not, and in turn it made them go wild and crazy. I really felt bad for them.<br /><br />Someone I didn't feel bad for, WICKED aka \\"the Creators\\". These people make me so mad. I get that the feel their actions are just in trying to save their world, but holy crap, I can't excuse the stuff they do. If I thought stuff that happened in the maze was cruel, the things the WICKED do are far worse. I'll just leave it at that. I'm sure I could go on and on about all they do, but then I'd give things away and I don't want to spoil this for anyone. It's seriously shocking what they do, but surprisingly through all this Thomas grows into the leader I thought he'd become in The Maze Runner.<br /><br />Thomas for me is the character that's grown by far the most. He's really stepped up and taken control the of the situations that the Gladers are constantly put in. Just when I think that things can't get worse for them, they do. It's the knowing that some thing has to give for them that keeps me reading this, well and that and the fact that I'm completely hooked on finding out who's behind on all this and what's going to happen next.<br /><br />Let me just say, James Dashner knows how to write action, butt kicking scenes, mystery, and killer cliff hangers! He reveals just enough for me to understand as much as Thomas does about this world, which intrigues me more than it irritates me. Normally I'd want to know what's going to happen next, but before I can start listing all my questions something else comes up and the story's action filled plot leaves me clinging to the edge of my seat. This is one series I think even the most reluctant reader will enjoy. Since we get a lot of questions about what books we'd recommend for guys, I'd definitely recommend picking this series up!taken control the of the situations that the Gladers are constantly put in.

B004ECDNJU|4.0|awesome game but it will spit out colors that you cant use so it forces you to lose lives. very annoying.
0385738773|5.0|Wow, talk about needing to catch your breath after reading a book. I've not read another series that kept me so invested with the story based on the action, the twists and the mystery alone, like this series did! Similar to The Maze Runner and The Scorch Trials, The Death Cure was non stop action from page one to the every end. Talk about plot twists, this story line is full of them. James Dashner has created a story that's complex, mystifying, and completely engaging. I couldn't get enough of it.<br /><br />Like being in the dark on what's going to happen next in a story? Well James made it literally impossible for me to try and figure out what was going to happen. Much like Thomas, I had no idea on who I could trust or believe, other than his two closest friends. Was WICKED really good, or were they really evil. Were those working for them really in the dark on what they were doing, or were some of the people there a bit delusional on in their ways? Or maybe they were right. I honestly still have no idea. What I do know, is that The Death Cure takes everything from first two books, and takes up to a whole new level.<br /><br />I admire James for the fact he's not afraid to inflict pain on his characters. Okay that was nice way of putting torture them. I don't know where the characters get the strength they all have to help them endure all they go through. The Death Cure is brutal on them, emotionally, mentally and physically. It's not just the characters who suffer, but the readers. James isn't afraid to kill off characters I was emotionally invested in, which made for some pretty intense scenes, especially the one between Thomas and...... you'll have to read it to know who I'm talking about. Ugh, that scene was a killer!<br /><br />The is definitely one action packed series! The first two books did a fantastic job at leading up to what happens in The Death Cure, but let me just say this book is intense! There's violence, which is completely fitting for what is going on in this book, there's casualties, and there's a bit of the unknown in this book, which I liked. James reveals some shocking answers to some of my questions, but he also leaves some open ended, and I liked that. It was very fitting for the series, and had he wrapped up everything nicely, he wouldn't have stayed true to the storyline. While that doesn't normally work for me in a series, it's the perfect ending for Thomas's story. I definitely recommend picking this book up! Be warned, you'll be thinking about everything that happened long after you read it.ing on in this book, there's casualties, and there's a bit of the unknown in this book, which I liked.

B005HSG3U6|5.0|I got this cover for my Kindle Fire for Christmas, and I really like it.  Actually, I loved it until I saw my cousin's cover.  She has a small strap inside hers that allows her to hold the kindle much easier when she's reading.  This cover does not have that.  If I never knew about the strap, I'd still love this -but now that I know I want one with a strap.  :)<br />Another minor comment, if you have pets, the inside of the cover is fabric, and it's the kind of fabric that seems to magnetically attract hair to it.  So I have to lint roll my cover occassionally.  No big deal.  It's a great quality durable seeming case.  I like it a lot.

B004EPZ0BQ|5.0|This is an excellent film.  Timberlake isn't that good of an actor just yet, but he REALLY has improved and this role showed off his skills!!!!  Kunis was AWESOME as usual.  The story  IS NOT typical or cliche'd as I had thought before watching it.  It starts out funny as all out-doors and morphs into a touching and sensitive film that truly surprised me.  Don't get me wrong...the laughs are there from beginning to end.  This film should get some type of award.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Very good chess program.  Interesting mix of occasional time-wasting moves and shockers that say \\"You just blew it, buddy!\\"  This program does not give up material easily.  Not easy to best at intermediate level.
B004EPYZPS|2.0|Five of us, of various ages, watched this move together.  We all had five thumbs down.  After reading some of the glowing rewiews here on Amazon, I do wonder if they mean anything or are written by the production marketing detartment.  This movie was quite lame; poorly written and the acting was uneven.  We gave up counting the gaps in the plot, such as it was.  Here we have a massive train wreck; yet the colonel walks right up and picks up the film wrapper.  I could go on, but why . . .
0545305497|5.0|I was very happy with the quality of the product & the prompt service & delivery.  I would recommend this seller.
1439102724|3.0|I love Jodie Picoult books and will continue to read whatever she has published, but this was not my favorite.  For how nuanced her plot lines/ character development can be, I felt like this book was contrived.  I found her depiction of Christians distasteful.  I am a Christian AND I believe that those in the GLBT community should have the same rights and privileges as all Americans.  Church and state should be separate! Furthermore, I and my church would not bash someone based on their sexuality... Of course, I know Christians who may act like those depicted in Picoult's book, but it is a shame to not include a character or a section that presents Christians as those who truly do love and respect others simply based on the idea that we are all created by God and equally loved by him.  Picoult wants to spread a message of acceptance and tolerance, but treats Christians in a one - sided, biased manner.

B003K07DUC|5.0|This movie is excellent. I have become bored with propaganda telling lies lies lies. This movie exposes he truth of a war we as Americans should have not fought based on lies. I read the reviews giving this movie 1 star and i have 1 thing to say (the truth hurts sometimes). Now in this country USA we find ourselves looking down the barrel of the same disease that started the gulf war Evil men with an Evil agenda are using lies to target American civilians as terrorist.NDAA 2012 says we will no longer have a right to a trial or lawyer if we are accused. The list of things they consider crimes is long and it includes Christians,Animal rights activist and others. So because we allowed all these crimes to take place and we did not resist evil liars now we are dealing with a corrupt criminal enterprise that has taken our freedoms away. Too bad some still confuse corruption for patriotism. The truth will always be told. God always has a witness.

0767903862|2.0|4892. In a Sunburned Country, by Bill Bryson  (read 2 Jan 2012) This is a 2000 book detailing Bryson's quite extensive travels in Australia.  It is often funny, especially in the early chapters.  There is a map which shows nearly every place mentioned in the book, I was glad to see.  He got to every part of Australia except Tasmania.  Often the travel seemed really tiresome and there are a  lot of uncomfortable places that he went to.  But one gets a pretty good picture of what travel in Australia would be like--not that I would want to do such travel.  Not a profound book, and a good history would probably be better reading.  It is the fourth Bryson book I have read.  Of the four, I thought The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid was the best.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I bought this cover along with the kindle fire for my wife as christmas gifts.  With the type of material it is made from, I had a good idea of what to expect, and I was not disappointed.  The cover is lightweight and slim in design, which provides impact protection for the device and the screen for that accidental drop that is bond to happen.  I have seen other covers in stores and online, and to me, this one of the best, if not the best covers out there to get with multiple colors available.

I like the style of the game, and the sound effects are solid.  But what I like the most about the game is how hectic it can get.  Within a few levels, you are having to move at lightning speed and are trying to juggle a few different colors at once, and it can get pretty difficult.<br /><br />I enjoy playing it, and overall, I think it's a solid product.

0374275637|5.0|I bought this book after reading a magazine article about Daniel Kahneman by Michael Lewis. Lewis, a superb writer, wrote glowingly of Kahneman and his work with his departed friend and research collaborator Amos Tversky and \\"Thinking, Fast and Slow\\" does not contain a single disappointing word.  Kahneman writes with authority yet his modesty and humor infuse the book and are all-to rare in academia and near-academic writing. If this was a textbook we could look forward to a new wave of well-informed, thoughtful and usefully self-aware psychologists. Read this book and enjoy a rewarding and rich new awareness of how your thoughts inform and direct your life.
B006FE3FFC|5.0|Things were crusing back and forth in the earlier episodes of the second season, but complexity reared its head in 6 and 7 in full brilliance.  The 7th episode has to be one of the best of them all.  We all may face the Kvorkian decision one day, this episode cleary shows the drama of one's emotions around deciding what is best.
1400062756|5.0|After hearing high praise for this book from several different sources I thought I'd buy it.  I couldn't find it available in Kindle ebook format sadly but now I've read it I'm glad I've got the hard copy as I'll be thumbing back through it for years to come.  It's got a powerful message that will keep me thinking and I'll definitely be recommending people to read it.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Without a doubt, this is the best book/movie series that I have seen.  Movie wise:  Deathly Hallows Part 2 > Deathly Hallows Part 1 > Prisoner of Azkaban > Chamber of Secrets > Sorcerer's Stone > Goblet of Fire > Half Blood Prince > Order of the Phoenix
0007189958|3.0|I liked this book and thought the characters were really realistic and likable. The plot was okay, and I was excited to get to the ending, only to be disappointed by how rushed and anticlimactic it was.

1439192812|5.0|I'm a parent and I bought this for my son, yet it was me that couldn't put it down! Very interesting and it explained things in an easy to understand way that was not at all boring. The drawings really did help the explanations come to life and I can't wait to read this to my child. Every parent should own this, I only wish I had this growing up when I had questions about the world and my curiosity was at it's peak.
B004U52VPS|4.0|What a hit this toy was!! He has spent hours with this game, building and then knocking them down. He told me it's his favorite toy. This can be used as just one player, just set them up and shoot them. Lots of fun for my 6 year old to do by himself!
B005NPLXJ4|4.0|Let me just say thet Lulu is in no way as dull, repetitive, boring or egotistical as J Hill of South Charleston, WV !  The album is fantastic, an unlikely collaberation that has delevered an art rock classic. The best thing either of these artists have done in a very long time.
B004FOA84A|4.0|I loved this game.  The graphics were really good.  As someone has already said, you could spend a lot of time just enjoying the settings.  I did think it was too short, as I was just really getting into it when it was over.  The ending,as a story goes, left you hanging.  I would love to see many more games like this from the Fire Maple Games, but much LONGER!
B005DD7H50|2.0|I guess my overall problem with this movie was less about what it's advocating/suggesting and just more about the story in general.  As a story, this movie failed to grip me from the very beginning.  I felt no connection to the main character.  When we first meet Bradley Cooper (at this point, I can't even remember his character's name, and I just finished watching the movie about 5 hours ago) he was down and out.  In the course of five minutes, we see him struggling to write a book (even though he oddly enough already has a contract for what I believe is a fiction--not normal), he loses his girlfriend, and we are told that he lost his first wife several years ago.  But that's it, within five minutes, he gets a drug, his life gets better, and all he ever has to struggle for again for the remaining 139 minutes is to maintain the steady dosages of the drug.  His entire life turns around pretty much.  He gets his girlfriend back, he gets millionaire friends, completes his book, begins trading stocks and hedge funds once he realizes that his life's calling.  I mean, at no point, are we really given a chance to feel for this guy.  As Robert de Niro most aptly pointed out, HE DIDN'T EARN ANYTHING.  He didn't put in work, he didn't put in effort, and yes, we are supposed to believe that his life sucked for a time before all of his success, but we barely see that.  There are a couple of instances where we are led to believe that he almost loses it all--the murder investigation, the sudden sickness, the thugs beating him up, but really, he doesn't even come close.  He's definitely not the standard protagonist and in 144 minutes, the writer's could not even develop his role so as to make him more human, more accessible, and somehow reconcile the person he became with the \\"bum\\" he once was.  If they had, I think we would get a character worthy of a movie.  As it is, this character isn't even worthy of a bedtime story.

1451627289|1.0|In brief, the novel is verbose, repetitive and didactic. Granted, the narrator is a high school English teacher, so the expectations of the prose aren't too high to start with. But that doesn't excuse the tedious overuse of certain words (\\"obdurate\\", for instance). And for the record, I like Stephen King, but I think he does better with short stories.
B004A8ZWT2|1.0|This film felt like a getaway for Depp and Jolie from filming difficult films. It's nothing more than a huge advertisement for the city of Venice.
0061433047|5.0|I have long been a lover of Terry Pratchett's work, and the Witches of Lancre are by far my favorite group of characters. As someone who enjoys young adult fiction as well, I was pleased as punch when Mr. Pratchett fused the two in the Tiffany Aching series. Completely charming. It was interesting to see Granny Weatherwax in a different element, as an observer rather than a participant in the continuing eldritch adventures of Disc-world. And Tiffany Aching has been the girl to take over the mantle of witchery from one of the greatest witches the Ramtops has ever produced. This fourth book appears to conclude our young heroine's journey, though it opens many questions and brings back Eskarina Smith, who started the witch series and who has been absent in the last 35 novels.

She signs beautiful and she sings in \\"Oui, Oui\\" (That`s how we call French) Instantly I fell for her spirit, her powerful voice, elle est une petite Piaf de nos jours.<br /><br />I love her puissance, her joyous music and effervescent personality. This CD is by far one of the best pieces i have owned in my life.
B004TI5N38|3.0|I have NEVER written a review on Amazon; however, this book by Baldacci was Lee Child's Jack Reacher all over. The only difference is that Puller didn't sleep with the woman. Also, I guess Puller loved the old lady he saved, but forgot all about the cat. Poor cat died of starvation in West Virginia, while his cat AWOL must have starved half to death in D.C. while he was working in coal country.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|\\"Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children\\" is the story of Jacob Portman, a fifteen year old boy who was raised on his grandfather's stories of growing up on a magical island full of children with amazing powers ranging from levitation to invisibility to super-stregnth, all hiding from terrible monsters. His proof of these stories are old photographs that a growing Jake soon realizes would have been painfully easy to fake or alter, meaning he has become like the rest of his family and no longer believes the stories. Instead, he believes his father's explanation that the magical island with a house of peculiar children was an orphanage in England for Jewish refugee children during World War II and the monsters they hid from were the Nazis; he is assured his grandfather is only romanticizing his past to make it more accessible and less painful to a child. This all changes when his grandfather (now believed to be senile since he constantly speaks of his made-up monsters coming after him) calls Jake begging for help. Jake goes over to check on his grandfather only to find that he has been killed, and he thinks that he saw one of the monsters leaving the scene. Just before dying, Grandpa Portman gives Jake a cryptic message that Jake comes to believe are instructions to find his grandfather's childhood home. So, he convinces his father to take him to a Welsh island in search of the truth. He finds the house and in his investigations, eventually stumbles upon a story even bigger and more amazing than the ones he was told as a child.   First off, I would like to state that the pictures really didn't do much for me. They felt more than a little forced in. Some of them were hardly even relevent (for example, slightly paraphrased, \\"If she lifts rocks in the act, why isn't she doing it in her photograph?\\" \\"She was sulking because Miss Peregrine made her dress like a lady.\\" describes the photograph where the only extraordinary thing is that the girl wears no shoes; another early example is just a man lying on a couch with a pistol -- Grandpa Portman was paranoid.). The narrator himself refers to the photographs as \\"so obviously manipulated that even a kid would have seen through them\\". While I realize that the intent of the book isn't to convince us the phtographs are real, a child's face pasted onto a dog's body or a face painted onto the back of a head hardly strike me as haunting and fascinating. Most of them are either regular photographs of people who look a little odd (no shoes, holding a chicken, photographed from the back, not smiling, etc. etc.) or are just old-timey photography mistakes like double-exposures, blurred areas, and shiny eyes. The most inexplicable one, the twins in odd costumes with one apparently eating a ribbon, is annoyingly not explained or even referenced aside from acknowledging its existence.  Personally, I think I would have preferred the book without the photos. They aren't in any way neccesary to the story. It could easily have been the same story if Grandpa Portman told his stories and left his message in death without any references to photgraphs (which, honestly, seem pretty reckless for a bunch of children in hiding from the world to be taking anyways). And Jake would still have gone to Cairnholm to learn the truth and...still no photos needed. It would have let things flow forward more fluidly and would have cut out a lot of pointless explanations of the photographs. In the end, the photos are just a gimick to get you to pick up the book.  My only other major problem with the book was the romantic subplot. I could never really get behind Jake and Emma as a couple. She definitely got into the relationship for all the wrong reasons and it certainly happened much too fast to be entirely believable(First day I've known you? Let shameless flirting ensue! Second time? Let there be kissing!). !!Warning: Minor Spoilers Ahead!! Also, as Jake himself points out, it is extremely weird for him to be romantically involved with his grandfather's sweetheart, even if she is still technically his age. One good reason for this is that Emma is clearly only using Jake as a substitute for his grandfather for most of the book. I was also never really sure what exactly the attraction was for Jake since Emma was not exactly pleasant for much of their interaction.  !!Spoilers Over!!  I would also say that the story got a bit slow at times and had a few other extraneous elements (I don't really care about your \\"rich teenager in suburbia\\" angst, and did we really need that many minor characters?). Other than that, however, the book was well-written and kept my interest well. It even managed to make me too afraid to sleep (though not because of creepy photographs -- just terrifying creatures). The mystery is probably a little too easy to figure out, leaving few real surprises, but it's thrilling and does leave you anxious to find out more. The ending was properly climactic and exciting, closing up most loose ends and leaving the others perfectly poised for the sequel.  All in all, I would certainly reccomend this book, though I wouldn't reccomend getting too excited about the photographs.

B0006BD9EC|4.0|This book was a quick and pleasant read.  It was fairly clear and simple to understand.  I read it after taking a class on negotiations so it confirmed much of what I had already learned in class.  I would recommend this book to others.    My only criticism of the book would be to add more examples of negotiations situations where a particular principle was used.  They had several examples that were pretty good.  I would have appreciated more examples that the average person would encounter, though.

A treasure to have, especially in blu-ray format!!
B0066W1AZK|5.0|This app works great on the Kindle Fire, I definitley recommend this it....there was no glitches. Just a simple game of chess, two players, or one vs. computer. There is no custimization of the board or of what the chess pieces look like though, which may or not be be a con, depending on the User.
B005ZUR724|5.0|I give this a 5star rate 1 Bc it is almost like a real mmorpg onlined based game.

The best calendar app for the Kindle Fire and anything else!

B000REQTJU|5.0|This DVD of a silent film milestone was fantastic.  Quality was good and the timeless story is worth the time and effort.  I used it in conjunction with a college class I teach: Technology and Society and it is a fantastic example of an early movie depiction of a dystopia.
B0067AC5KA|4.0|Just finished the entire trilogy. An intraverted girl is set up by the government when she is 12 years old to hide a secret that her father has to protect. A very twisting story that will make you think \\"so that's why that happened.\\" Very strange group of people that have a kind of casual sex ring with each other going on while they try to solve the mysteries of Lisbeth Salandar. Murder, mayhem, scandal and all sorts of other goings on in one series. Still interesting story but a little strange in the end.
B0012TUPRQ|5.0|So my next reviews of the RAM mount and pieces are going to be a cut and paste job.  Not sure what else I can say and really these parts aren't the sexiest.  They however are solid and long lasting.  I wouldn't say that I \\"abused\\" the system this summer, but I certainly put it through its \\"paces\\".  The system did not buckle and is waiting to be used again.

0071762345|5.0|I opened this book and in the first chapter realized I'd stumbled on to something special. I've worked in Social Media for the last three years, I even created a position for myself at a P.R. firm using mostly, trail, error and Facebook. While I experienced some notable results and made most of our clients very happy, I always felt like there was something missing. Dave Kerpen's book was it. Through all of my social media ventures, I've used the old-school rules of advertising and marketing to try and make a splash on The Social Network. While it did generate results, it was never as effective as it could have been. In so many cases we were spending a lot of energy and creativity selling ourselves, when we really should have just spent time building community, being creative and authentically connecting with our clients and their customers. The permission and freedom that this book gives you to engage and connect with people is amazing and a game changer for the advertising world.   In a few years, I believe the philosophies contained in this book will mark Dave Kerpen as the Bill Bernbach of our time. I'm so grateful he chose to share his wealth of experience in this book! :)

B002N5N5LQ|5.0|...but I won't buy it until it's on blu-ray. NBC needs to learn how to properly capitalize on their many beloved cult favorites that fail to find large audiences. It's about making money right? Well, if you don't have the viewers for ad revenue, then find another source of revenue. I'm just trying to give you money. Would you like my money? I am simultaneously willing to fork over $100+ for the entire series on blu ray OR pirate it online. Your call NBC, but I and many others will not be buying anything on DVD ever again.

B003Y5H542|5.0|Warped.  Weird.  And Wonderful.  All of these things describe the movie and the world that is \\"Rango\\".  Oh, and if you get the Blu-ray then add Stunning to that list.<br /><br />What caught my attention as with so many others was the world and characters that populate the town of Dirt and the world of Rango.  From the tire-treaded armadillo to the griselled I-don't-know-what-it-is-wombat-cat-thing that finds hope in the titular charge these mostly one-dimensional creations are transformed into multi-dimensional creatures via the artistry and imagination of the writers and visual artists.  I felt that I knew them in the short time that I watched them on the TV.  And they were mesmerizingly beautiful in their dirty, hair-crusted, feather-bent, lop (and lost) eared forms.<br /><br />Whoever voice-cast that tortoise should be given a raise; pitch perfect like the rest of the film!
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|so after adding evernote to my fire, I realized I can link up to all my other devices which is handy since I have my to do list spread out it is nice to have one todo list that I can access almost anywhere (excluding non Wifi times). it also has come in handy searching websites on kindle fire and sending to my evermore where I can access on computer for further reference instead of sending a hundred individual emails I can send tons of notes which is easier for me to deal with. I do wish that if you title your note the same there should be a process that automatically combines them. seeing as it is difficult while surfing to quickly put different webpages under one note. I don't use evernote for creative ideas so all they have access to is my to do list and websites I like but I will remember in the future. now lastly the one real frustrating thing that I seem to have problems with is my evernote not displaying my notes on the phone I can access them but I wish it instantly displayed them instead of blank box that I have to open to access. also if you can have a pad on the computer like colorpad so I don't have to open evernote to see my notes. that is where Wifi only access is annoying.
B004W4N55C|4.0|Unfortunately the iPhone has the market cornered on decent guitar related products relating to the new smart phone revolution. This app, however, is a great tool for the android user. Built in metronome, tuner and chord/scale diagrams (along with the ability to \\"strum\\" the chords) makes this a pretty cool \\"on the run\\" guitar tool. Certainly worth a couple of bucks.
B0013527I4|5.0|We purchased all three seasons.  They arrived promptly and in great shape.  This is a wonderful video for all members of a family.
B005ORVMCY|5.0|As with my previous review on Sector 3, Sector 2 does not dissapoint. This set includes Rush albums from A Farewell To Kings to the live album Exit...Stage Left. Each album sounds fantastic, like a breath of fresh air has been breathed into each album. The packaging is really neat, but like others have said it can be a pain. Some of the CD's did have small scratches present on them, but nothing too major. The artwork on this particular set is pretty close compared to the way the original vinyl album appeared. Now for the sound, as I said before, each album sounds excellent. Starting with 'Kings', it begins with a sound, probably Alex beginning to play the acoustic intro, that was not present on the '97 remaster. Very interesting. As for Hemispheres, the more I listen to it, the more apparent it is to me that the '97 remaster must have used 'no-noise', as this 2011 has more hiss like the original album, where as each song segues into one another. According to other reviewers, the version of Moving Pictures in the Sector 2 box set and the one released previously as a CD/Blu-Ray edition are the same remaster, although I cannot personally confirm this, other than the 2011 version definately sounds superior to the '97. And finally, and maybe most importantly, 'Exit' has never sound better. As many of you are aware of the less-than-stellar production for the album which there really can be nothing done about, this remaster really packs a punch and sounds miles ahead any previous edition. As for the AFTK Audio-DVD, as far as I know there is a problem with the mix on 'Closer to the Heart' and possibly another issue stated by other reviewers. Hopefully they can resolve these issues in due time, along with the issues present in Sector 1. Other than that, these sets are definitely worth it for the sound alone, along with the neat packaging and a great booklet with photos/lyrics/credits. If you're a Rush fan and wondering if these remasters are worth it, let your ears decide!

B004XN3FHA|5.0|having already owned a Fenix Flashlight, I wanted to get something a little bigger and more powerful to than the little pocket light I had.  After receiving it and installing the batteries, I couldn't believe what I had.  First of all, this light is about the size of the old Ray-O-Vac all metal sportsmen flahslight.  The two buttons, one for on/off and the other for intensity are placed well and easy to find.  the four basic modes from low to turbo give a nice range of light intensity to fit the job you need.  Low is very good for close in 10-20 feet and you can increase intensity instantly with the left hand button as you need it.  On Turbo Mode, I literally lit up the entire roof of my house when I was 150 feet away and tree tops from 300 feet away, Like I said, this is more a searchlight.  It is easily the most powerful handheld light I have ever seen.  A few comments:  It is well made, uses good materials with a nice fit and finish.  the end cap threads on securely and precisely and the textured grip keeps it from slipping out of your hands.  .  It doesn't rattle unless you shake it hard and uses 8 \\"AA\\" batteries, making it easy to feed it power.  the controls are smartly located and easy to use (I haven't tested the blinking modes, I doubt I ever will have a need)  it is of a familiar size and thickness so I had no trouble holding it.    it comes with spare seals and a nice little plastic case.  Use the turbo mode sparingly and only when you really need it.  it WILL eat batteries as a healthy rate if you use it alot.    I wish the end cap was a bit heavier, like a maglite, but I guess it would mess with the overall balance of the light  DO NOT look or let anyone look, into the light.  I can easily see this doing damage.  use it carefully!  I always start mine on the lowest setting for this reason.    the head does get warm so be mindful of this when using over a period of time.  While expensive, this light performs to its price.  if you need a super high performance light, this is the one to get.

0312641893|4.0|So.. Cinder is Cinderella meets the Terminator with a splash of The Hot Zone plagues and quarantines for good measure. Cinder is a cyborg, which at first concerned me in terms of love-interest ickiness (not so sure about robot/human love play).   But, as it turns out, Cinder is only 36.28% non-human. Due to a horrible accident when she was younger, her foot, hand and some internal parts were replaced by hi-tech mechanical ones. So, not so creepy, more like prosthetics, that's fine, right? Well, not according to society, where a person with any percentage of robotics is deemed as property and plummeted to second-class citizen status faster than you can say unbridled discrimination. Thus, the setup for our tale.   Cinder is a great mechanic who is oppressed by her wicked step-monster/owner, has a fun android BFF (love her!), gets in hot water and meets a prince (natch). The premise, in and of itself, is an intriguing one, but the premise alone could not have sustained the book without Meyer's excellent pacing, plotting and world building. Cinder's relationships are developed organically and you grow to hate/love/kinda like the people in Cinder's world right along with her.  The story does hold a couple of twists (most you will get right away) and my figuring them out didn't really annoy me (like it usually might) just because I was more intrigued by how the various characters would react once they found out.  My only criticism would be that Cinder has fallen into the YA reader-manipulating pitfall of ending a book right in the middle of a major plot-point, thus insuring that the rabid reader will stand in line for the sequel. I will be one of those people (if a bit resentfully), but I wish this madness would stop. It is possible to write/edit a YA novel and wrap up the main story while keeping enough carrots dangling to keep the reader anticipating the continuation of the tale. This just seems like a device for a book that is not as well constructed as Cinder is. Themerits of the Cinder alone would have prompted readers to seek out the sequel, the gimmick is unnecessary. If anything, it makes me not want to recommend this book to my friends until the sequel has come out so they won't be hanging on tenterhooks like I am.  Overall, I think Cinder is a great book and I really wish I just had the whole series in my hands right now.(Four books are already planned - one each year with a different storybook mashup added in).
B005ZHBA9I|4.0|At first I was like whaat, Carter Burwell is back? Then I was like wow, Carter Burwell is back. But then I felt conflicted and confused about how I felt about it. So I turned to my spanish television astrology guru on Univision for guidance on the matter. And he told me that I have to choose between liking Carter Burwell and not liking Carter Burwell. For me, the moment was incredibly distressing. How could I choose when I had never heard any of two scores?? I resolved myself to find the love (or hate) within for Carter Burwell. This was something I had to do. This was something I could not continue further without exploring and truly understand. For I knew if I could learn weather I truly loved Carter Burwell's work or hated it, it would bring a deeper understanding of myself. I am not ashamed to say I cried many nights and I cried. Many times I sung myself to sleep. Unfortunately the song I sang came from a John Williams score and my sleepless nights were in vain. I would look to the moon hoping for an answer to this dire situation. No resolve. I would look to the Sun  - directly - until I lost my eyesight and still I had no idea weather I loved Carter Burwell's scores for this series. Then, there was finally a revelation. that b-t-h from across the street told me to listen to the scores.<br />It was like learning about calculus.<br />So I sat down and listened to the downloaded scores I had purchased from that other place. My mouth gaped open and I realized something I had been denying myself all this time. I realized that I -------

B001U88814|3.0|I didn't think Crocs could make an uncomfortable shoe but I've been finding problems with my pair of Blitzens from the beginning.  The faux fur lining was warm and comfortable until I walked a few feet, then I realized there was a hard piece of doubled up \\"fur fabric\\" compressing my middle toe on the right shoe (I noticed this in more than one pair that I've tried on so it apparently isn't an isolated problem - and these Crocs seem to be shorter than other types for some reason).  Since I'd already bought this pair online and the only problem seemed to be that uncomfortable lump in the toe section, I was forced to cut that hard part out with scissors (yes I could have returned them but I needed them).  After that, they became comfortable and wearable for a while.  However, that wasn't the end of the problem.  Inside the shoe is fairly tight due to the lining - keep that in mind when you buy these - make sure you buy larger than your size!  Not only is it tight but wearing socks makes it tighter.  And then there's the cleaning problem.  Wear them for a few days, the \\"fur\\" gets matted and the liner has to be taken out and washed (by hand, air dry!).  They do wash up quite nicely, but getting the liner to go back IN the Croc is a total ordeal.  The rubber \\"grommet\\" on the liner has to be fitted over the button (you know the one, the signature Croc on the side that smiles at you).  This is REALLY difficult.  You will need to use the back end of a spoon or something of that nature to help you get the grommet over the button.  It is a literal ordeal.<br /><br />Would I buy Crocs Blitzens again?  No.  I'd buy regular Crocs and invest in some nice fuzzy socks instead.
1451648537|4.0|Anyone who has served in the IT industry in the past, the present or are planning to should read this book.  I have spent 20 years in the industry working at HP and IBM among them, and found this book to be introspective.  I did not work in Silicone Valley, but did spend some time there training and researching for the various technical roles I performed.  The valley is an interesting place where most everyone embraces new technology.  I actually live in the midwest, where people and companies adhere to a more conservative approach.  Reading this book has confirmed what many of us know as the 80/20 rule.  In the IT industry, it is that 80% of the results are performed by 20% of the people.  There is no way I could have ever worked at Apple because I surely would have been a non-performer.  In my opinion, the book presents just the right amount of information about Steve Jobs. The book is about him, right?  But then I started to want to know more about the other people in his life, especially the engineers.  Did that always work that hard?  Did they want to?  Did they after they left Apple?  Mr. Isaacson writes about many of the women in the same way the women of the bible are presented.  They are all great supporters, followers and trusted advisers.  Why?  What are some of the key things they did to nurture their relationship with Steve?  As I mentioned earlier...lots of introspection.  I served in the IT industry during all of the periods when Apple products and Steve's products were introduced.  I found it intriguing to learn of the turmoil that was required to produce these products.  While I also worked during stressful times to complete products that were either brought to market or placed into production, it was not chaotic the way it was portrayed in this book.  I'm glad I did not live through that.  Many other reviewers admire Steve Jobs for his approach to making all of this happen and believe it could not have happened otherwise.  I disagree.  Regretfully,I feel that careers and lives were destroyed, which I think are more valuable than a computer.  As a result of reading this book, I hope to be more focused and pursue creation of an application suited to my interests and desires.  It will probably be for a Droid.
B00000JHAU|4.0|Even though frontman Stuart Murdoch was nearing 30, Belle and Sebastian's debut [[ASIN:B00000I9MK Tigermilk]] displayed a fascination with the tribulations of one's high school years set to sunny pop melodies with some restrained cello and trumpet adding a distinctive touch. The follow-up album -- and indeed the general public's introduction to the band because of the limited initial pressing of its predecessor -- was the 10-track IF YOU'RE FEELING SINISTER. While maintaining a \\"twee rock\\" atmosphere, this is a deeper, more foreboding and troubling effort.<br /><br />Continuing Stuart Murdoch's songwriting as complex storytelling, the themes of IF YOU'RE FEELING SINISTER include a struggle with one's sexuality, the generation gap and teen suicide. Curiously, in spite of the haunted nature of so many of the tracks, the overall mood of the album is upbeat. It is that combination of joy and melancholy that makes this album a unique experience even in Belle and Sebastian's discography. Most of the songs are extremely catchy (earworms) and they abound with lyrical turns that are poetic but quite unpretentious.<br /><br />While I view TIGERMILK as an absolutely perfect pop creation, IF YOU'RE FEELING SINISTER doesn't quite live up to its predecessor. The last three tracks -- \\"Mayfly\\", \\"The Boy Done Wrong Again\\" and \\"Judy and the Dream of Horses\\" -- are forgettable, and I took that hard when everything I had heard from the band until then proved supremely memorable. Another major issue is the sound quality: in a few songs the microphone always feels just a bit too far away from everyone. Stuart Murdoch has even noted that although he considers these his best songs, they are not well recorded.<br /><br />My rating thus vacillates between 4 and 5 stars. Nonetheless, I think anyone should take a chance on this album and TIGERMILK. I regret overlooking Belle and Sebastian all these years.
B005JE1JZC|5.0|I love Robin Hobb books. She has a way of writing that is so believable and makes you feel that you are there with the characters. She can make an ordinary sentence sound like gold. The Farseer Trilogy and the Tawny Man Trilogy which follows, are exceptionally good in this fantasy genre.

B000C20VPA|5.0|\\"Casino\\" is a crime drama film that is based on true events. Creative license has been used but essentially numerous events are similar to those experienced by Frank \\"Lefty\\" Rothstein, referred to in this movie as Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein.  Rothstein (Robert De Niro) is a seasoned gambler with a history as a professional sports bettor. He is put in charge of the Las Vegas casino Tangiers as part of a Mafia effort to build a stake in the market, and to also siphon profits back to its unofficial owners before disclosing a reduced bottom line to tax agencies.  The film narrative conveys large scale corruption and violence associated with the gaming industry. It also puts forward that there are few loyalties within the greedy and ruthless community of casino managers and owners.  Nicholas R.W. Henning - Australian Author

B0060AY6FO|1.0|A hideous, plodding, ungraceful piece of mawkish fanfiction that succeeeds neither as a mystery or as a pastiche of Austen's most beloved novel. Oy.<br /><br />Almost from page one, there are embarassing lapses of craft and tone. None of the economy or vibrance of Austen appears in these pages and the so-called plot is built around a \\"mystery\\" that was so hamhanded that I'd sussed the perpetrator within the first 50 pages. But that's not the worst of it. More than anything, this entire story has an air of workmanlike drudgery about it, as if a third of the way in James had realized she wasn't up to the task but soldiered through by force of duty. Apathy and sloppiness strangle this book a page at a time.<br /><br />Any fiction that \\"expands\\" on an existing narrative must do heavy lifting (familiarizing fresh readers with the previous work, but also standing on its own merit). This book accomplishes neither. I cannot imagine WHAT possesed anyone to publish this outside of James successful track record as a crime novelist. If anything, that skill set should have been a deterrent. For some reasons of her own, James structures the entire experiment as a closed \\"country house\\" mystery with (essentially) a single location. As in the most inept mystery fiction, she treats the P&P characters as unchanging chess pieces sealed in aspic with a single defining character trait. No one here has a believable emotion or motivation. Unlike Austen, James presents a plot which is a flimsy, mechanical contrivance existing purely to generate tiffs and tizzies with no real weight or consequence to anyone. None of the pacing or movement or drama of an Austen novel is in evidence. And watching endless cooing and billing by the Darcys and the Bingleys had me reaching for the airsick bag often. THERE ARE NO STAKES. What lobotomized Jane Austen was P.D. James reading when this thing got cranked out? Where was the wit, bite, and wiliness of Austen's world?<br /><br />I respect James as a mystery author, but this was appalling in most of its particulars: plot, diction, character, setting. For me the hardest thing to read were the incessant \\"remember when?\\" exposition nuggets by characters recounting many, many MAJOR events from Pride & Prejudice as if they were all recovering amnesiacs giving depositions in an imaginary courtroom. \\"Remember when she said to me... Remember when I asked you...\\" I can only assume the James felt like we might need a refresher course, so she has characters turn to each other and explain proposals, embarassments, arguments, scandal from P&P... as if everyone on the page has had a closed head injury in the intervening years. As if people reading THIS book wouldn't be familiar with the other greater novel's most critical scenes and lines. As if quoting Austen was the same thing as expanding upon her. As if Austen's characters are so wooden and static that they cannot manage to do anything that they have not already done 200 years ago for thir creator. As if \\"historicizing\\" Austen's characters didn't encumber some of English literature's most nimble creations with deadening, leaden weight.<br /><br />And apparently James has no interest in the beloved characters AS characters as they neither act or speak like themselves (even when quoting their earlier dialogue), nor does she allow them to be changed by the (pointless/flaccid) events of this novel. The convoluted, digressive explanations for offpage actions in P&P derail this book repeatedly. James is so busy opining about eventslong past and unrelated that for long stretches she forgets that she's supposed to be, y'know, writing a book of her own. An Elizabeth who now distrusts/dismisses Charlotte (Lucas) Collins on a whim and worried more about sick servants and social obligations than Wickham's invasion of her home? A Mr. Bennett who now sneaks off to hide from his wife's \\"flutterings and spasms\\" in the Pemberley library? A Darcy who traces his austerity to Oprah-ific childhoodtraumas and protects Wickham with little difficulty? Gack. Ick. This is in effect, a piece of inept P&P rhapsody which treats the main characters of its source material as the very boring, bourgeois blockheads they skewered so ruthlessly in Austen's novel. Which begs the question: if James cannot write the characters, if she had no sense of the subtlety or a feel for emotional plotting, why bother to write this book? Again, shades of the feeblest fanfiction by the most uncritical amateur...<br /><br />What can you expect if you DO read this hash? No characterization to speak of. A slim, idiotic \\"mystery\\" that telegraphs its solution from around page 45. Lots of suspiciously procedural mystery writing in \\"ye olde\\" Regency-speak. Long, long passages of obligatory backstory delivered in massive unparagraphed chunks as if, by parroting some of Austen's diction, James might swipe some of the spark and effervescence. Not hardly. Ugh. Endless, ridiculous requotings of \\"good bits\\" from Austen's writing lifted DIRECTLY from the six major novels that jarred every time I stumbled over them. Apparently, James just liked certain phrases so darned much she decided to plunk them in wholesale and the effect is uncomfortably awkward. These regurgitations resonate not as loving homage but as failure of imagination and craft. To take one example, Elizabeth can apparently ONLY be described as having \\"fine eyes.\\" Wickham must always be tagged with the phrase \\"quite wild.\\" And Pemberly is \\"polluted\\" THREE times in this book, and Lady Catherine doesn't even show up to use her own words. And a good thing, if the clunky, leaden Darcy and Elizabeth here are any indication, any of Austen's creations who don't turn up for the \\"scandalous\\" proceedings got off lightly. And don't get me started on the weird easter eggs giving \\"clever\\" shout-outs to other Austen characters (Harriet Smith, Anne Elliot). Again, in what universe does any of this posturing resemble Austen or even a competent piece of fiction? James knows better. Her publishers know better. Her readers should know better. Are people so bamboozled by the spectre of \\"great literature\\" and an &eacute;minence grise that they'll swallow this kind of muck uncritically?<br /><br />This entire book felt feeble and awkward and a little embarassing. If you are an Austen fan you'll loathe it, if you are a mystery fan you'll find it juvenile and obvious. Neither fish nor fowl, the book exists as a kind of a trout with wings (or sparrow with gills) expiring painfully and repetitively for 280 unwitty pages. About halfway through I realized that this is the kind of Austen pastiche enjoyed by people who don't actually read Austen, and who believe that all period fiction just needs some velvet and horses and servants to thrill us to our middlebrow Masterpiece Theatre marrows. When I'd finished, I tried to imagine the intended audience... Best I could come up with: elderly suburban nonreaders who love telly but can't follow any story without coaching from well-meaning relatives and a repeated peeks at the TV Guide blurb.<br /><br />Horrible.

But I have only used it one time and I'm done with it. I did not uninstall it though because I think that I will play this game when I need something that will stimulate my brain when I am bored. :) This game is totally worth my $0.00 but if I had to pay for it, I wouldn't get it...
0545265355|4.0|I found this trilogy to be incredibly engaging. That said, I think a lot of comparisons are unfair - it's nowhere near as amazing as Harry Potter and thank goodness it's not Twilight. It stands on its own as a well-written, original story that will engage teens as well as adults. The dystopian society that the books portray can be a bit intense and depressing, but it feels incredibly real, and you feel the characters hopelessness. I couldn't put the books down and I would highly recommend the trilogy to anyone looking for a good read.
B002T9H2LA|5.0|Received it right on time. Was exactly what I wanted. I ordered it aS a last minute Christmas gift and everything worked out. Didn't even have to pay shipping. That's a plus!!
0385535139|3.0|Fans hoping for a book that rivals John Grisham's best efforts should keep looking. I will admit that this book was a fast and enjoyable read, however, it was all style and no substance. I did laugh out loud in several instances, but laughs alone cannot save this book. It was very formulaic and one-dimensional. The characters were incredibly basic and not drawn well. The relationships were cliche and flat, and some plot points were never developed. While the story was not entirely predictable, I think that was only because had it gone were it seemed like it might, it would have been absolutely ridiculous. I think the premise had promise, but instead played it safe and resultantly was incredibly formulaic. I honestly do not know why John Grisham insists on churning out these mediocre books year after year. I can't imagine he needs the money and I at least would prefer a return to his great books, even if they didn't come out as often.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing! At first, I was reluctant to read it, since so many people had hyped it up, but I was shocked by how  great it was. It is comparable to Harry Potter! I couldn't put this book down and  had to get the second and the third immediately after I finished. The characters will become part of you as soon as the plot thickens. Definitely give yourself a vacation to read this, because you WILL NOT PUT IT DOWN! Some people try to compare it to Twilight because of a similar plot twist, but for Twilight haters, don't be afraid. For Twilight lovers, you will absolutely love this. I can not wait until this movie comes out,  even though, in my opinion, the cast does not portray the characters to their fullest! Make sure to have a gift card or credit card near by to purchase the rest of the series!
0307279189|5.0|Wow! This book is a must read for anyone interested in fitness. It covers ultramarathoners, barefoot running and our evolution as running machines - all couched in a page-turning story of a footrace through the mountains of Mexico. Reads like fiction, but based around some fascinating science. Loved it!

B000YIGNKE|4.0|This movie--like every film adaptation of an Austen novel--has its positive and negative qualities, but overall I enjoyed it immensely. Let me start by saying that I teach Austen's works at the collegiate level. I have read, researched, and taught every one of her novels and have seen almost every film adaptation (even the obscure ones) of her work. Each director and actor brings to Austen's work his/her own interpretation of the story and its characters. Each reader has his/her own vision of how that story and those characters should look. It's no wonder, then, that the reviews on this film are so varied.  So please indulge me while I offer my take on this 2007 version and address some of the issues and concerns others have voiced.  Of course, good casting is a key element in bringing Austen's characters to life, and unfortunately the casting quality here is a bit varied.  As for the central character, I actually prefer Sally Hawkins' portrayal of Anne to the other actresses I've seen--including (dare I say it?) Amanda Root (gasp!).  Some critics here claim Hawkins seems like a wimpy, emotional wreck. I disagree. We cannot ascribe 21st century qualities to a 19th century character.  In her novel, Austen clearly describes Anne as attractive (though past her bloom), intelligent, refined (but not stuffy), and feeling a profound sense of duty, responsibility, and loss. I think Hawkins captures this much better than Root who appears more like a dowdy, flat, 30-something governness than a romantic heroine. Hawkins displays the restraint and propriety of a character struggling to keep her turbulent emotions in check while being the sole voice of reason and sense in a group of colorfully clueless yutzes. Yes, her emotional outburst at the end is overwrought, but that is the fault of the director, not the actress. However, I did enjoy the director's ploy to have Hawkins look directly into the camera at certain crucial moments in the action.  While this may be disconcertingto some viewers, I find it offers us a sense of intimacy and connection to Anne and her story. Hawkins' subtle, soulful glances at the viewer provide a lovely window into Anne's heartbreak and mixed emotions. In her eyes we share her pain, anguish, embarrassment, hope, and joy.   As Hawkins' co-star, Rupert Penry-Jones is a handsome leading man who is actually more age-appropriate than Ciaran Hinds who was pushing 50 in the '95 version. RPJ's acting could use a bit more depth and complexity, but his subtlety shouldn't be confused with being flat, as some have suggested. His eyes are quite expressive if you watch him carefully. Anthony Head is perfect as Sir Walter and brilliantly captures his ridiculous,snobbish vanity. Tobias Menzies does an admirable job skating the thin like between charm and sleeze to play cousin Wm Elliot.  Other casting choices are not so great. The Elliot sisters are ill-cast.  At 40, Julia Davis is too old to play the 29-year-old Elizabeth although she captures her personality well.  Mary's character is appropriately annoying but Amanda Hale portrays her with such odd affectation as to make her a distraction. Admiral and Mrs. Croft are delightful characters, but Marion Bailey (60-ish)is too old to be believable as Wentworth's sister. The Musgrove girls are unremarkable, but I must say it is nice to see Nicholas Farrell appear as the senior Mr. Musgrove.  Casting aside,the story is generally well told, although decidedly NOT an accurate rendering of Austen's plotline. Some conversations are rearranged in different timelines and with different characters, but it doesn't affect the film's overall sense of story. Yes, the famous drawing room/letter-writing scene is tragically and inexplicably removed here. In its place is a clumsily-contrived mechanism that finds Anne clutching Wentworth's sadly-abbreviated letter and sprinting crazily through the streets of Bath in breathless, fevered pursuit of him. Those last scenes are the major failing of this film. I understand that Anne is experiencing a flood of pent-up emotion here, but nothing in the novel or the film would indicate her abandoning all sense of 19th century propriety and decorum to publicly race after a man who can apparently move at lightning-stealth speed. It is a total departure from her character. I agree with other reviewers that the ending is rushed. I can only offer that this was done to accommodate a 90-minute run time. A miniseries version would perhaps allow more plot complexities. Oh well. The prolonged, final kiss between Anne and Wentworth bothers some people but not me. Yes, public kissing violates Victorian social codes, but come on-- this is a movie. I can accept the kiss much more than Anne's 5K marathon through the streets of Bath. Perhaps the kiss was a tad overwrought and icky, but as an earlier critic pointed out, it was tentative, anxious, and messy--just like real life. I did find it odd that so much attention was given to Anne in that scene while Wentworth just seemed like a faceless, static set of lips waiting to be smooched. And the last scene of Wentworth presenting Kellynch Hall to Anne as a wedding gift was touching but blatantly implausible. Do we seriously believe that Sir Walter and Wm Elliot will give up their family estate? Even with his fortune, Wentworth could never have afforded that purchase. I'm not sure what that scene hoped to accomplish, but the film should have ended with the kiss. Still, I admit that I was touched by the two waltzing on the lawn at Kellynch in absolute bliss.   So overall, it you are an Austen purist, this version of her last novel will frustrate you. However, if you are like me and can appreciate all the different interpretations and productions of a beloved classic, I think you will enjoy this film despite some of its major flaws. I own all the versions of this film, but this is the one I repeatedly watch. Even with its hits and misses, in the end the film conveys exactly what Austen intended: a sharp social commentary, a poignant portrayal of recaptured lost love, and an inspirational tale of faith, hope, and second chances.
B002LFAHBO|4.0|The only gripe I have with the blu-ray is that the song \\"the trouble with love\\" doesn't play during the movie (the scene at the Christmas party)...although, they have the music video in the Bonus Features. I was a little bummed out about that, however, I still love the movie no matter what.
B003Y5H5AQ|4.0|First of all let me say that as a 29 years old woman with no children I am not exactly the target audience for this movie so my opinions of it should be read by that in mind. Now when trailers for The Smurfs first begun to air the movie got allot of criticism for placing smurfs in modern New York City instead of the fantasy world where they belong. I to was a bit skeptical but I must say that I think the movie makers have done a good job and actually made the New York part fit. I used to watch The Smurfs cartoons when I was a little girl and I think that putting a non animated movie in that setting would be disturbing, this way they manage to not disturb the setting allot of people have fond childhood memories of and at the same time use some of these characters in a feature film.<br /><br />The plot of the Smurfs is simple but it works. I found myself engaged in it and while it is simple enough for children to easily grasp it fits nicely together and have enough humor and structure to entertain adults as well. Basically the movie starts out animated and follow the smurfs preparing for a big party, unfortunately one thing leads to another and a handful of smurfs as well as the evil but pretty failed wizard Gargamel get sucked into a magical portal and end up in New York City. Now the smurfs have to find a way to get home, luckily they meet a young couple, a overworking advertisement man and his wife who helps them on. Gargamel however is still obsessed with smurfs and do his best to track them down with the help of not always working magic and his cat and hilarity ensues.<br /><br />Now one complaint I have about The Smurfs is that the movie play it very safe, there is very few surprises in the plot, already from the first time we see the New York couple who befriends the smurfs and see that Patrick miss his wife's first ultrasound because of work we know he will learn that family is all that really matters, the first time we see the other smurfs be mean to Clumsy we know he will end up the hero of the story, and I am not spoiling anything here it is just that obious. Five minutes into the movie you know how it will end. That being said getting to that end is quite entertaining.<br /><br />Both me and my hubby enjoyed The Smurfs, I think it is to predictable, but all in all this is a sweet, safe movie. I would call The Smurfs a true family flick as it is safe for the youngest kids, and older children and adults can also find something to enjoy about it. Technically this movie is solid, the actors do a good job, the animation on the smurfs themselves are good and music and sounds are quite ok. Now for me, even had I been six I think this would have been one of those movies you watch, enjoy and then forget about as it is just so predictable, but all in all I think that the movie makers have done a great job in bringing smurfs to the big screen. If you have children or you enjoy cute fairytale stories with allot of heart and a happy ending then I definitely recommend The Smurfs.up the hero of the story, and I am not spoiling anything here it is just that obious. Five minutes into the movie you know how it will end. That being said getting to that end is quite entertaining.  Both me and my hubby enjoyed The Smurfs, I think it is to predictable, but all in all this is a sweet, safe movie. I would call The Smurfs a true family flick as it is safe for the youngest kids, and older children and adults can also find something to enjoy about it. Technically this movie is solid, the actors do a good job, the animation on the smurfs themselves are good and music and sounds are quite ok. Now for me, even had I been six I think this would have been one of those movies you watch, enjoy and then forget about as it is just so predictable, but all in all I think that the movie makers have done a great job in bringing smurfs to the big screen.

B000683VI4|3.0|I have not received the product yet, but it still says it hasn't been shipped yet, though it says that it will arrive today. I placed my order four days ago, and this is quite worrying. I do not appreciate my order not being shipped until the day it is due for arrival. If it only takes less then a day, which is hard to believe, I do not understand why it had to wait four days and not the day after or at least two to three days after.  GREAT PRICE THOUGH!
B003Y5H4Y8|4.0|Quite a number of people found the movie to be not only slow but confusing and I can see why. Often the problem with directors and editors is that they are so familiar with a script that they can start to play with nuances which an audience in a theatre cannot rewind to figure out or an audience at home is often too distracted by ongoing home & family issues to devote 100% maximum attention to capture the critical subtleties.   Guide that can be read a few minutes into the movie:   Characters: See them in Israel in 1965 and again in 1997. Rachel Singer (25) marries Stephan Gold (25) has author daughter (Sarah) but likes David Peretz (29). They are after Surgeon of Birkenau (Dieter Vogel) in E. Berlin on New Year's eve 1965.   Goal: Capture Vogel in E. Berlin and put him on a W. Berlin train that briefly passes into E. Berlin before continuing back into W. Berlin.   Problem: The cover up and lies about Vogel's death when he escapes and the consequences of resolving those lies is our story.   Guide if confused after most or all of the way into movie:  Gold asks Peretz to go after Vogel after he escapes from them. The guilt of living the false capture/killing lie (notice how ill he is from that guilt); also that Singer would not give permission to tell the truth. Finally, being asked by Gold to go to the Ukraine Psychiatric Hospital for the final killing of Vogel all leads him to suicide. Singer accidentally finds the real Vogel kills him and she dies after bleeding slowly (note closeup of blood dripping as she walks down the hallway) or outside the hospital (not shown in edited version). Leaves note telling a reporter the truth.   Hint: Listen to sounds/music and visual symbolism. Three scenes where Vogel ministers to Singer and three scenes where Singer ministers to Vogel.  Last scene on airplane, Singer looks at Peretz but he only looks down and not back then several ominous black vehicles come out of the blinding white light toward the airplane as they walk off. Isthat the white light of pending death?

1451648537|5.0|More than anything else, this is a book about corporate leadership in the late 20th and early 21st century.  What does it say about Jobs' leadership?  To me, it said three things.<br /><br />First, it said that great leaders -leaders like Jobs - lead with ideas, a few ideas about which they are totally and absolutely uncompromising.  For Jobs, those ideas had to do with simplicity, the user experience, focus, and aesthetics.<br /><br />Second, it implied that relentlessness and ruthlessness will often be a part of the package that comes with leaders such as Jobs.  Jobs knew what he wanted and would not tolerate anyone or anything that got in his way.<br /><br />Third, Jobs was fixated on winning.  He was, if I may borrow a sports analogy, the Vince Lombardi (\\"Winning isn't everything; it's the only thing.) of his era. As a result, there was absolutely no room for \\"B\\" players on the Apple team.  Jobs never sugar-coated his thoughts and feelings about products or about people.  If they didn't measure up to his standards, they were ----.<br /><br />For me, the most illuminating parts of this book related to Jobs' aesthetics and to his showmanship. From his early years, Jobs was lead by his intuition for beauty and it was this, more than anything else, that governed and controlled him.  Finally, his instinct for showmanship, for publicity, and for projecting his own image and the image of his company were nothing less than magical.
B002VPE1WK|5.0|*Short take: Best bang for the buck.   - If you are just starting out and already have a few lens and cameras to carry because you are worried that you might need the one you left at home, get this bag.   - If you need a bag quickly and can;t decided on what size you really need and don't wana dish out the money for an expensive unit out of fear it may not hold everything, then get this bag.  * Why:  - Very low price.  - Good quality materials and build.  - Lots of compartments.  - Good padding makes it very comfortable to carry around.  - Straps make it feel very snug and secure on my back.  - Lots of room to hold several lens and even two small-body cameras.  - Overall low-key appearance: looks like a backpack and doesn't scream \\"photography equipment inside\\".  * Suggested Improvements:  - A little more height (2 inches or so) so once can fit a lap top (soon to be out dated technology anyway).  - A little more depth (an in or so) so it can fit a Canon 1 series-sized camera standing up, attached to a telephoto lens.  - The bright orange tabs be made a matching black to avoid attention.
B0014Z4ON4|5.0|IMHO, I acknowledge only two Indiana Jones movies worthy of greatness: the Original Raiders movie and this, the Temple of Doom. The other two Indy films: Last Crusade and Kingdom of the Crystal Skull are poorly paced, contrived, tired, simplistic and very derivative. I know many people disagree with this assessment, but hold Temple of Doom against the other two movies, and you will see the weaknesses: thin plotlines, poor action sequences, tired pacing and inferior storytelling. The last two movies that simply don't measure up to the first two.   TOD is definitely the darkest of the Indy films; watching the adventure unfold, you are literally lowered into the pits of hell, in the face of true evil and darkness, with one of the strongest villains in film history. This very movie created the PG-13 rating category, which says alot about the level of horror portrayed. Like Raiders, TOD is a fast paced adventure rocket ride that features superb photography, exotic locations, a wonderful new original musical score by John Williams and rip roaring action sequences that stand as textbook examples on how to expertly film an action movie. The various action sequences have a natural flow to them that are physically credible, well sequenced and exciting.  Short Round and Willie Scott are Indy's companions in this sequel, and both add sporadic necessary humor and lightheartedness to break up and balance off the extremely dark and nightmarish sequences. Despite Spielberg's personal opinion about TOD not being his favorite Indy movie, I consider this film one of Spielberg's greatest film achievements. From beginning to the end, you are on the edge of your seat. This is pure adventure in the spirit of the old movie serials.

B004ECDNJU|4.0|I've been really enjoying this game since getting it for free yesterday (I think?) from amazon. However, I've reached level 17 and it seems that the fireballs eventually get generated in such a way that it is not possible to play a perfect game on that level. The number of in play fireballs is capped at 3, and every time I play I will end up having three balls of colors that I can't use to advance the game without sending them into another color and, thus, losing lives. I'm not sure if I'm just using them in the wrong order, or if I just need to be extremely lucky in order to make it to the end of the level without having to send.  This isn't meant to detract from you getting this app, as it is a lot of fun. I just couldn't find a website or forum belonging to the developer, and thus must post my grievance here. Were it not for me getting stuck (and as I said, it may just be me not using the fire balls in the correct [if such a thing exists] order).  All this said, get this game because it's great.

B0059XTUMC|5.0|French director Michel Hazanavicius' The Artist is a delight to experience, a highly enjoyable and superbly crafted homage to an era and a style: the silent movies. While one can definitely appreciate it more if one has some familiarity with the silent movie era, it is not a necessity. The Artist will give anyone who's never seen a silent movie the experience of what seeing one was like and how different silent movies were stylistically to the 'talking' films which have been the norm for the last eighty years. And why people loved them as much as they did.<br /><br />The Artist is set in Hollywood - the heart of the film industry - in the critical period between 1927, when silent movies were at their peak, and 1932, by which time they had become a thing of the past, completely displaced by 'talkies'. The film begins with a swashbuckling action sequence, but then the camera moves back and reveals that we're actually watching an audience watching a film, the premiere of a Hollywood studio's latest production featuring its star actor, George Valentin (Jean Dujardin). After the premiere is over, when Valentin is posing for the press outside the theater, an accidental encounter brings him face-to-face with an admiring young fan, Peppy Miller (B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo), who ends up being photographed with him. In a turn of classic Hollywood mythology, Miller is 'discovered' and given a shot at being an extra in a film, which turns out to be the next film Valentin is featured in. A second chance encounter results in Valentin taking Miller under his wing, insisting to studio boss Al Zimmer (John Goodman) that she be given an actual part in the film. And thus Miller's career in film is begun.<br /><br />The next part of the film draws thematically from  film classics Singing in the Rain and A Star is Born. Fast-forwarding ahead to 1929, it is the beginning of the talking era, and studios are rushing to adapt to the new technology. Valentin is dismissive of the innovation, but Zimmer informs him that the studio is switching over to talkies immediately and anyone who can't adapt will be left behind. Refusing to budge, Valentin instead decides to produce his own silent epic, pouring all of his money into the production which he not only stars in but also directs. The film, Tears of Love, bombs horribly, ruining Valentin financially and eventually costing him not only his career and his house but also his marriage as well. But as Valentin's career fades, Miller's star is on the rise and soon she is a leading actress in her own right.  But even as the plot descends into melodrama, it retains its comic touches and things are ultimately resolved in the most classically upbeat Hollywood way:  a musical dance number.<br /><br />Besides drawing on many of the themes in Singing in the Rain, The Artist is in many ways the perfect counterpoint film to it. Singing in the Rain deals with the transition from silent films to talking films, presented in a talking film with talking actors. The Artist deals with the same transition, but as a silent film centered around the point of view of a silent actor. Hazanavicius makes clever use of his format choices, bringing out Valentin's fears in a delightful sequence where everything in Valentin's room suddenly starts making noises. Already startled, Valentin then descends into panic when he realizes that his own voice is still silent, and that everything - and everyone - is being heard except him.<br /><br />Hazanavicius did a lot of research in preparing for this film and put a lot of thought into the shooting. Besides being down in black and white, the Artist was also filmed in the full-screen ratio (1.33:1) that was the standard during the silent film era, which enhances the actors' faces, making them bigger on the screen, an important factor when much of the characters' intentions and feelings had to be conveyed silently rather than through dialogue. He also studied the lighting and camera techniques the original silent film directors used to enhance expression and convey mood.<br /><br />The cast are, in a word, marvelous. Jean Dujardin's Valentin is the embodiment of the silent film movie idol, using heightened expression and body language - not to mention perfect comic timing - to bring his character to life. This is done quite subtly as we're often watching film within film, so that when the characters - who are silent film actors - portray characters in the films they're making, they're done just slightly more exaggerated than the characters are when they're being themselves.  B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Bejo does the same with her Peppy Miller, playing the rising young ingenue and the comedic characters that her character in turn portrays. Hazanavicius knows his actors, having worked with both Dujardin and Bejo in previous films (not to mention being married to Bejo in real life), and knows exactly how to bring out pitch perfect performances from the both of them. The supporting cast, from John Goodman's comically put-upon studio boss to James Cromwell's devotedly loyal chauffeur, Clifton, are also excellent. And then there's Uggie, the perky and soulful little terrier who steals every scene he's in as Valentin's on-screen and off-screen dog.<br /><br />As one would expect in a film like this, Hazanavicius has worked in a number of nods to the silent film age and to films and the film industry in general, some of them fairly obvious and others rather subtle.  For example, the sequence that shows Valentin and his wife becoming estranged is a comic take on the classic sequence from Citizen Kane showing Kane and his wife becoming estranged over breakfast.  Later, a scene shows Valentin in his reduced-circumstances apartment, watching a reel from one of his silent swashbucklers on a projector. The scene in the film is actually from a real silent film, The Mark of Zorro, which starred Douglas Fairbanks, one of the biggest stars of the silent film era.  In the places where the shots are close enough to recognize the actor, Hazanavicius inserted Dujardin in place of Fairbanks. And in another scene later in the film after Miller has become a major star, a rescued Valentin ends up being taken to her mansion after his apartment has a fire. The mansion used in the scene originally belonged to Mary Pickford, one of the biggest stars of the silent film era, and the bed Valentin wakes up in is Mary Pickford's actual bed.<br /><br />Highly recommended, both as a truly creditable homage to the silent silver screen and as a thoroughly enjoyable film in its own right.ression and convey mood.

B001UV4XIS|3.0|This film was disappointing to us.  Had hoped for more of a recap at the beginning of the movie, since it had been a while since part 1 came out.  I fell asleep mid-way through and I can honestly say, I have never done that in any other Harry Potter movie.  Perhaps it's fitting that this is the last one.

1451648537|5.0|Book Review  Steve Jobs, by Walter Isaacson, Simon & Schuster, December 2011  Reading biographies of famous people and world leaders is always fun and educational, especially during dreary winter days. The libraries are full of them, from Attila the Hun to Stalin, from Truman to Ataturk, the greatest leader of the 20th century, although Time dropped him from its list of \\"Important Persons of the 20th Century\\" in 1999.   The biography of Steve Jobs by a former editor of Time, Walter Isaacson, is a masterpiece that makes a reader to \\"Think Differently\\", using one of Jobs quotes, about the lives of geniuses, the creation of companies, friendship and the life itself and death. One of the comments in the 630 page book is about a servant who follows a victorious general paraded through the streets of Rome with a job to repeat to him, \\"Memento mori?- Remember you will die\\", (P.461.) According to Isaacson, Steve Jobs always remembered that one day he would die. After he was diagnosed for cancer in 2003, he died on October 5, 2011.  Like millions around the world, I have always been fascinated with the computers every time I sit in front of one, be it at work, libraries or home. What an incredible device, I tell myself, and wonder how it all works. I never owned an Apple computer or any of the Apple products, iMac computers, iPods, iPhones or the iPads sold at the Apple stores, including the magnificent store in Manhattan that Steve Jobs himself designed. However, I followed the developments in the computer industry like everyone else and the lives of many pioneers who ushered the computer age and the life of Steve Jobs, the genius who changed the world. I was surprised that Steve Jobs was not picked as the \\"Person of the Year\\" in 1984, when he first introduced the Macintosh computer, instead giving that honor to Computers, although Steve fancied that he would be picked, as told in the book. Perhaps, to make up for this, Time has issued a 96 page special \\"Commemorative Issue\\" in December 2011 that chronicles the life of Steve Jobs, including a section which shows that he was on the cover of Time 8 times but never as the Person of the Year.  Steve Jobs was born in 1955 in California to an American student who was dating a graduate student from Syria, Abdullahfattah Jandali, a moslem. Since they were not married and both were still in school, they decided to give Steve for adoption. A wonderful couple took Steve and raised him as if their own and convinced Steve to attend college with the fund that they had established for his education. He attended Reed College but dropped after a semester. Steve's adopted father was Paul Jobs and mother was Clara, the daughter of Louis Hagopian, an Armenian born in Malatya in 1894 and Victoria Artinian, born in Izmir in 1894, who immigrated to the States following the 1915 Armenian re-location, according to an article in a newspaper but not mentioned in the book. Steve was traumatized by the fact that he was an adopted child and felt abandoned all his life. He met his biological mother many years later and visited her many times but never met his biological father, not forgiving him for abandoning him, although he did the same thing when he initially abandoned his daughter Lisa born out of wedlock, although in later years he bought a house for Lisa's mother and visited her many times. Steve also had a sister, Mona Simpson, who became a writer and wrote several novels that also tell her brother's story, such as, Anywhere but Here, and The Lost father. Mona meets their father but does not tell him that Steve is his son.  The book tells the story of Steve Jobs who goes to India in 1974 where he becomes interested in Hinduism, Zen Buddhism and becomes a vegetarian. After he returned to Palo Alto, he established a shop at the garage his father's house with a friend, Stephen Wozniak and together established Apple. The book is not only on the life of Steve Jobs and the products that Apple invented between 1977 - 2010, and how they were introduced to the public with grandiose events. Steve had a wide circle of friends that included President Clinton, Bono, Joan Baez, and working relations with the CEOs of major companies in the Computer industry. There are many episodes in the book that tell about his dealings with Bill Gates, the founder of Microsoft, the second richest man in the US, who has also revolutionized the computer industry. The book mentions that Steve Jobs noted after iPad launch in January 2010 that President Obama never called although he did get one congratulatory call that day from his chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel. During one of Obama visits to the Silicon Valley, Steve Jobs spoke with him and even offered suggestions on how to improve the economy. He is also noted in the book statimg that Obama might  be a one term President.  The book also has many revelations on how some companies in the US work and whether the CEO or the Board has the ultimate control of the company, in Apple case, certainly the CEO, although he was fired by the Board and brought back after 12 years. Many prominent politicians, CEOs of many companies were on the \\"Board of Directors of Apple and Pixar\\", the two companies founded by Jobs, which he served as the CEO simultaneously, even wondering if it was legal, since there were none others like this. Steve Jobs became the greatest business executive of the era, history probably placing him right next to Edison and Ford, and made Apple into the richest company on earth.  The book includes a section with many photographs, including several from his trips to Japan, Greece, Hawaii and many other places. The book also mentions a visit to Istanbul with his family during a trip that Steve Jobs took to Turkey in 2006 after being diagnosed for cancer, probably at Bill Gates's advice who has vacationed in Turkey several times. A tour guide who arranged Steve Jobs' Blue Voyage trip wrote recently about this trip, including Steve's remarks aboutthe Armenian issue. One of Steve's best friends who worked for him was a brilliant engineer named Avadis Tevanian, an Armenian-American who must have told Steve about the Armenian tragedy and the events in 1915, most likely one sided, since not very many Armenians admit that certain Armenian groups revolted in eastern Anatolia before, during and after the First World War to create a state of their own on lands where they were never the majority. Evidently, Steve did not give the tour guide the iPhone that he had promised at the beginning of the trip and even did not shake her hand when they parted after the guide told some facts about the Armenian issue to set the record straight. However, these are not mentioned in the book.  Below is what Steve told Isaacson about his visit to a Turkish bath in Istanbul where a hired history professor took his family:  \\"I had a real revelation. We were all in robes, and they made some Turkish coffee for us. The professor explained how the coffee was made very different from anywhere else, and I realized, \\"So what?\\" Which kids in Turkey give a darn about Turkish coffee? All day I had looked at young people in Istanbul. They were all drinking what every other kid in the world drinks, and they were wearing clothes that look like they were bought at the Gap, and they are all using cell phones. They were like kids everywhere else. It hit me that, for young people, this whole world is the same now. When we are making products, there is no such thing as a Turkish phone, or a music player that young people in Turkey would want that's different from one young people elsewhere would want. We are just one world now (P. 528)\\".  It is interesting that Mark Twain did not like the Turkish coffee either that he had during his visit to Istanbul more than 100 years ago, as he told in his book on his travels to Europe.

B006RED4GA|4.0|This is the kind of ghost story we need, creepy and effective without the use of a video camera reality. In fact, Luke makes a statement at the beginning of the film that his video camera is broken. That was a cool way of the director letting us know that there will be no found footage in this film. This is good old fashion ghost story that simply rocks.  If you truly love horror, don't pass this one by.

1401225756|4.0|The author is his own best critic for this volume, when he says that he finds these early stories awkward and trying to find their true voice. If you can forgive the fact that this is a rookie attempt at storytelling, it is quite a trip to read. I have not read the subsequent volumes yet but I look forward to it, and since I just found out that there's a re-colored version of this volume (I read the old one), I may read it a second time before moving on.   I found the first thirty pages or so of the volume to be the most \\"awkward\\" of the story, but once it gets into the main character's actions, it gets good. Just sit through it all and you'll be rewarded in the end.

1439170916|5.0|When family and friends are diagnosed with cancer, you try but cannot understand this insidious disease.  Why does it strike; why is it so difficult to find a cure; why did one therapy work for one person but not another; why did the cancer come back?<br /><br />This brilliant book answers these and many more questions in a manner that people who are not medical professionals or scientists can understand.  You may not like some of the answers, but the book delivers a wealth of information.  You will be a much better informed caregiver, friend, or patient.<br /><br />The book is very long, but it is so well written that you will be engaged throughout.  The  history of the search for a cure is very illuminating.  Although the early discoveries were relatively recent, it is amazing how far the science has come, but still has so far to go.  The impact of politics and profit on the search for a cure is frustrating, but can give the reader impetus to get involved.<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to anyone who has been affected in some way by cancer, which unfortunately includes most people.<br /><br />[[ASIN:1439170916 The Emperor of All Maladies: A Biography of Cancer]]

Asus P8Z68 Deluxe/Gen 3  Intel Core i7 2600K  EVGA GTX560 video card  Corsair TX750 power supply  Corsair Vengeance 16GB  OCZ Vertex 2 Sata II drive  Cooler Master Hyper 212 Plus (duel fans)  (replacment - Noctua NH-C14)   Windows 7 OEM system builder pack  CM Storm Trooper case  Amazon sells great products, has excellent customer service. Try to make your purchases through Amazon.  They are great.  Amazon always ships quickly and packs very well.  Update:  My i7 2600k temperature on my Asus board idled at 31c - 36c and when playing Battlefield3 temp got as high as 59c - 62c using a Cooler Master 212 plus.  I changed the cpu fan to a Noctua NH-C14 and now my cpu temps idle at 19c - 24c, gaming at 36c - 46c with Artic Silver thermapaste in my Cooler Master Storm.  Running two fans set at exhaust and four fans on intake.  Great CPU. Has never froze.  I did notice cpu core speed runs between 1600 and 3900.  At 3900, I get my highest temps playing over two hours.  Mobo running at 23c.  Rises to 28c while playing games.  Living in Hawaii not running air con the case gets warm.  I would keep in mind your environment when buying a case and fans for this awesome CPU.
B004A8ZWVU|5.0|Although I didn't read Kathryn Stockett's [[ASIN:0399157913 The Help Deluxe Edition]] book, I found Tate Taylor's movie THE HELP very touching and entertaining. The movie does touch on racism in the south during the 60s, but it isn't necessarily about racism; the film is really a moving tribute to the real women who were the \\"help\\" by giving them a voice.<br /><br />In a nutshell, the movie is told through the words of \\"Aibileen Clark\\" (played by Viola Davis) as she tells her story to \\"Skeeter Phelan\\" (played by Emma Stone) who wants to become a reporter and finds the perfect angle to a story: getting the point-of-view from the perspective of the maids. Skeeter also gets stories from Aibileen's best friend, \\"Minny Jackson\\" (played brilliantly by Octavia Spencer), but it isn't just to get a job: Skeeter's own nanny/maid \\"Constantine\\" (played by Cicely Tyson) suddenly disappears without saying a word and leaves Skeeter with a broken heart and many unanswered questions.<br /><br />For those of us not born in the South, I think that it's not so unusual for white children to be brought up with black nannies. I have a friend who was born in the south and a black woman raised him, although he had both parents around, and in the special features, both Stockett and Taylor (director) grew up with black nannies. So it seems unusual to me, but perhaps it isn't that unusual at all.<br /><br />Anyway, the movie also touches on the friendships that happens between the women, regardless of color. I wouldn't go so far as to call it this generation's  [[ASIN:B000084326 The Color Purple (Two-Disc Special Edition)]], but there are shades of it. Remember, the movie (like TCP) is a snap shot of a time and place, and isn't meant to be a criticism or analysis of people but rather showing the human spirit as it is able to rise above the challenges of life.<br /><br />*****  SPECIAL FEATURES  ******<br /><br />\\"Making of The Help: From Friendship To Film\\" -- 23:25-minutes Featurette<br />Interviews with the director, Tate Taylor, author of the book Kathryn Stockett, actors Viola Davis, Octavia Spencer, Emma Stone, Bryce Dallas Howard, Sissy Spacek and others, and private homeowner Jack Johnson whose house was used in the movie.

B005V1WZ10|4.0|Korn have never been a band to shy away from experimentation. Dating as far back as 1998 with the release of their commercial breakthrough, \\"Follow the Leader,\\" the band's ever-fickle fanbase has been divided about each and every single adjustment and bit of tweaking the band apply to their undeniably unique sound. It should come as no surprise then that in 2011, nothing much has changed. In spite of all of their potentially debilitating line-up changes and the ever-changing landscape they fight to stay relevant amidst, somehow the underdogs from Bakersfield always find a way to survive. Accordingly, the band's latest offering, \\"The Path of Totality\\" is a testament to the band's resilience and ever-growing (if not sometimes misguided) willingness to take their sound to the limits.<br /><br />For album number ten, Korn -- now consisting of original members Jonathan Davis, Reggie \\"Fieldy\\" Arvizu, James \\"Munky\\" Shaffer as well as drumming powerhouse Ray Luzier -- have taken a dip in the ever-growing dubstep gene pool. Collaborating with the likes of Skrillex, Downlink, Noisia and Feed Me, the foursome have deconstructed and reassembled the Korn sound with surprisingly groovy results. In spaces where the double-guitar attack of Shaffer and former member Brian \\"Head\\" Welch dominated, dissonant riffs and samples now rule the realm. Likewise, Fieldy puts his somewhat-signature clickety-clack slap-bass approach to rest with the help from some intense and undeniably delicious wobble bass, making for a fresh and unique sound that is typical of the dubstep genre but still undeniably Korn.<br /><br />Perhaps the album's finest moments are ones you may have already heard. \\"Get Up!\\" burned up rock radio this past summer and is without a doubt the band's strongest and most wide-reaching single since \\"Here to Stay\\" premiered nearly a decade ago. Likewise, \\"Narcissistic Cannibal\\" (in spite of its silly name)  best represents the marriage of two styles and is pretty much the catchiest tune of the set . Vocalist Jonathan Davis still plows through these numbers with the sort of angst that has plagued him for the bulk of his career, but because the songs are so infectious, the redundancy of a 40 year old happily married millionaire complaining about his so-called problems is easy to forgive and forget.<br /><br />To be sure that \\"The Path of Totality\\" is more Korn than anyone else, deeper album cuts such as \\"Bleeding Out\\" and \\"Way Too Far\\" are about as close to classic Korn as you can get nowadays. The former features a bagpipe solo that brings a sense of familiarity to the proceedings while the latter is about the broodiest anti-ballad the band has concocted thus far. Despite the album's various successes, it's not without its patchy spots. \\"Illuminati\\" finds Davis growling about Obama being a puppet in the New World Order which, while admittedly fresh terrain for the frontman who once wailed \\"I don't wanna talk about politics,\\" is a sort of embarrassing and unnecessary attempt at keeping the band's edges sharp. Also, quite a few tracks in the album's midsection tend to gel together, lacking hooks or a distinct sound to set them apart from one another. It seems of all the dubstep producers to tackle the album, Skrillex -- the most high-profile of the bunch and a self-confessed Korn Kid -- seems to \\"get\\" Korn the best. Perhaps an album full of Skrillex produced songs (or even an EP, as was originally intended) would have been the way to go.<br /><br />As it stands, \\"The Path of Totality\\" is a refreshing effort compared the stale nu-metal grind of the band's previous offering, \\"Korn III: Remember Who You Are.\\" It may take a few listens to sink in and perhaps the most jaded of Korn fans will write it off instantly, but there's certainly enough gems tucked away to ensure the band still have juice - both as a mainstream rock act as well as a creative entity - to keep pushing forward despite the fact that they may have peaked commercially and creatively a long time ago. While it's sure to be a divisive effort and you can probably smell another \\"back to the roots\\" follow-up down the road, it's good to see Korn sort of get their groove back.<br /><br />The Deluxe Edition of the album features two bonus tracks -- \\"Fuels The Comedy\\" and \\"Tension\\" -- which neither add to nor subtract from the rest of the album as well as a full-length DVD concert shot in conjunction with the release of \\"Korn III: Remember Who You Are\\" which finds the band playing to...no one at all.a divisive effort and you can probably smell another \\"back to the roots\\" follow-up down the road, it's good to see Korn sort of get their groove back.

0312641893|4.0|I knew just by the description that I was going to love this book. And really, what's not to love. This is a very different retelling of Cinderella. The few resemblances revolve around the family life and the Prince that comes into Cinder's life. The story takes place in the future and while it's still on Earth, there are characters that come from the moon as well. One of my favorite characters is a robot and I loved Cinder's character just as much. The story had me laughing at times and then the tears began at others. There is enough going on in the story that I was left wanting more, but not too much as to overwhelm. This is a fantastic start to a new series and I can't wait to read the next one, it can only get better!<br /><br />ARC Reviewed by Jessica for Book Sake.

B005HSG3TC|2.0|What a bummer. This cause did live up to all the good reviews. At least for a couple of weeks. It fits well, it is light weight, it protects the Kindle Fire but it started to peel. By peel I mean the soft plastic outside is peeling off. So far it is on every corner and the edges and some on the back. I have had a range device cases before. I have been in the tech industry for many years. So I don't complain lightly. I am returning this case and getting the slightly nicer leather version from the same manufacture. I hope it protects just as well. I will note that I would have kept it if it didn't look so bad.

B005BCE7FQ|3.0|I'll review only 3D feature .its Simple plot movie directed towards kids but in my experience kids love out of screen effects and we adults created whole dilemma of in depth vs out of screen effects .This movie can be easily defined as in depth 3D with may be couple of pop out effects.After one hour mark clearly there is much improvement in 3D effects .Throughout movie subtitles also keep switching trend .First hour or so they are in depth but afterwards they start to pop out .Clearly director kept his spanish heritage intact in this movie by giving great detail to color,samba(Booty shaking) and songs.<br /><br />On side note as I'm fan of pop out effects by ckenisell ;<br /><br />  To label 3D as a gimmick is just incorrect when it's used properly.<br /><br />I still remember The Muppets in 3D at Disney and one of the characters (gonzo maybe?) points directly in your face. EVERYBODY in the theater thinks that the character is pointing at them. It's an amazing experience and I don't think anybody in the theater was thinking about anything other than the muppet pointing at them. You are drawn in more when those things happen. Not taken out of the scene.<br /><br />Now, having said that, it has to be used sparingly. It's not cool to always have in-your-face shots. Your brain would tire of it. If you watch the behind the scenes of Tangled 3D BD (or maybe it was the Shrek 4 Dreamworks crew that said it), the directors talk about dialing up and down the depth of field in 3D so that your brain doesn't get used to seeing the in-your-face shots. They do this so that, when those shots do occur, your brain interprets those shots as something special. The directors can use 3D as another tool to draw your emotions into their film.

B0034G4P94|5.0|As a fan of mixed martial arts, I ordered this movie on demand expecting to get a little mindless action. What I got was a well-acted movie with real, believable characters and a plot that satisfies but doesn't cheapen the ending by giving in to sentimentality. Some characters reconcile, some don't- that's real life and that's how they ended this movie. The MMA action was surprisingly well-done, though flawed. Striking and submissions were reasonably good but some of the throws were cartoonish. If the director had resisted the urge to include a few over-the-top moments this movie would have been just about perfect.

0439023521|5.0|\\"I enter a nightmare from which I wake repeatedly only to find a greater terror awaiting me.\\" -Katniss Everdeen      Rating: 9 / 10      The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins is the first book in a trilogy that details the conflicts of Katniss Everdeen, a 16 year old girl who lives in District 12 in the Empire of Panem. Katniss must overcome impossible odds to survive in a kill or be killed competition known as the Hunger Games.      The book is fast-paced, focused, exciting, and an overall fantastic read for any audience. Collins does an excellent job of trimming away useless details and focusing on the Katniss's perspective. Her lean writing style creates a quick tempo and makes it hard for the reader to put down her story. I found myself reading at least 100 pages per sitting.      Collins is able to command a sense of the present. Almost all her tenses throughout the story are present-tense and demand a sense of immediacy. This style ensures the reader is immersed in Katniss's quick thinking and keeps the tension high.      Finally, Collins never allows a boring moment. Each chapter ends momentously and you never feel like you can miss a word because it all seems so pivotal. Collins keeps the reader on the edge of their seat, eagerly awaiting every word. The story was so engrossing that within the two days it took me to finish her first book, I immediately went and downloaded Catching Fire, the second book.      One of my favorite characteristics of Collins's writing is how clean the book was. I never found any language, romance, or violence to be gratuitous. The novel maintains a sense of brutality, but in the utmost necessary way. The story is riveting and pulse-pounding, but does so because of Collins's mastery of efficiency and pace.      To anyone that hasn't picked up this brilliant and fresh novel, Suzanne Collins has written a fantastic novel that will leave you breathless and hungry for more. In the ominous, booming words of Claudius Templesmith, \\"Ladiesand gentlemen, let the Seventy-fourth Hunger Games begin!\\"    If you like my review, read more at [...]    Happy Reading!
B004GYY714|5.0|The best radio app I have ever seen!  Everything works perfectly.  I just wish the app would automatically disable the time-out feature  of the Kindle Fire.  Now if Amazon would add Spotify to the Fire, all  your music would be covered!
0439023491|4.0|\\"Katniss Everdeen, the girl who was on fire, you have provided a spark that, left unattended, may grow to an inferno that destroys Panem.\\" -President Snow<br /><br />  Rating: 8 / 10<br /><br />  Catching Fire by Suzanne Collins is the second book in a trilogy that details the conflicts of Katniss Everdeen, a 16 year old girl who lives in District 12 in the Empire of Panem. Katniss, having survived the trials of The Hunger Games, must now figure out how to exist as a victor, figure out her feelings about Peeta and Gale, and reconcile the fact that the Capitol may now consider her a rebel.<br /><br />  Collins ensures that her second book hits the ground running. The story picks up just a couple months after the end of the last Hunger Games. Katniss is once again thrown into the thick of things, and as we expect, Collins keeps up glued to every page.<br /><br />  In a story that lives up to the expectations established by the first novel, Catching Fire is nothing short of fabulous. The reader will notice a difference in the second book though when compared to the first. The first book is exactly what the title says, \\"The Hunger Games,\\" while the second book, Catching Fire, is more focused on the effects of her winning and whether or not the Capitol will consider her act of  a berry-induced dual-suicide attempt an act of rebellion. The beginning of the book quickly builds upon one surprise plot twist after another leading up to an exciting revelation. The book is a very rewarding read and once again leaves the reader hungry for more.<br /><br />  Similar to her first book, I couldn't put this one down. I read it in only two days and didn't miss a word. It was thrilling, edge of your seat action--again! Collins once again is able to effectively trim away all the useless details and leave us with something delicious to savor. Each chapter ends with a bang and with 27 enticing chapters, the read is fulfilling.

B004RJMUJO|1.0|I purchased this app back in August after having had the free version for about a month. Well, that was a mistake. The ads were never a problem for me. I wanted a smoother game play & more features which are usually the norm when \\"upgrading\\" from a free version. I noticed a lag immediately during the first game. An issue I never had with the free version. I swallowed my pride & left it on my sd card (class 10) hoping an update would eventually resolve all issues. Then I saw today that this app hasn't had an update in forever. I'll never get an app from Halfbrick again as they seem to forget about their old apps altogether in favor of newer ones.

B00005JKC3|2.0|Ang Lee's vision of The Hulk, the superhero version of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde crossed with Frankenstein, puts much emphasis on the character's origin, and Bruce Banner's (Eric Bana) relationship with his father David (Nick Nolte).  The story is quite drawn out, difficult to follow, and loaded with drama, things which might work well in a graphic novel with an extended storyline, but the 138 minute long film seems bloated, overbearing, and a little lacking in the action department for a PG-13 audience.<br /><br />Eric Bana is a decent actor, but riding around on a bike, he seems a little young to play an accomplished scientist.  Banner's green skinned alter ego seems oversized, and bloated, and never seems that he really belongs on the screen.  The other major characters, General Ross (Sam Elliot) and his daughter Betty (Jennifer Connelly), are integrated in ways that seem to fit, and Elliot in particular seems like a good fit.<br /><br />There is a crisply executed battle sequence where the Hulk escapes from captivity and tangles with the army in the desert, that is very much in the spirit of the comics, and captures the Hulk's ferociousness, although he still looks very much like a Looney Tune character superimposed on film.  From this highlight, things go downhill as the Hulk catches a ride on a fighter jet, then digs below the city of San Francisco to get to Betty.  The Hulk's other opponents are unconvincing CG mutant dogs, and his father David Banner, who has also acquired super powers and transformed into some kind of weird terrible looking gray colored variation of The Thing.<br /><br />While the Hulk was a huge commercial success, it's a real mess of a film.  Physically the Hulk is way out of scale, and the overdramatic factor that is David Banner pushes matters way past ridiculous, even for a comic book adaptation.  The final battle between Hulk, and the entity that was his father, has a reality factor of zero, and looks just awful.<br /><br />For Hulk fans, and those curious above the complete Marvel universe, the film is certainly worth a watch.  The two disc version has a number of extras, if you really want to know more about this big budget disaster.  It says a lot that [[ASIN:B001LM1456 The Incredible Hulk]] which followed in 2008, was a complete reboot that took practically nothing from Ang Lee's vision.he complete Marvel universe, the film is certainly worth a watch.

B005D0RDKW|5.0|Yes, it's a pretty geeky sounding title, but that's really what one should be looking for in a review.  If you like Rush, you don't need me to tell you that they're great.  If you don't like them, you probably aren't reading this review, because you're probably not shopping for their DVD's.<br /><br />Let me get the bottom line up front--this, by far, is the best sounding and best-looking of the Rush live DVD's (and I own all of them).  Rush is a band that has been hit and miss on the sound and video quality for their live performances.  Going WAY back to All the World's a Stage (which had very good audio, particularly for 1976/1977) to Exit Stage Left (which sounds and looks like it was recorded in a fog) to A Show of Hands (excellent sound, average video quality for 1987), they could really get it right, or really mess it up.  When they returned to live video's with Rush in Rio, they began to get the video nailed down pretty well, but the sound wasn't great--the noise from the enthusiastic crowd in a stadium detracted from the DVD.  Snakes and Arrows Live was excellent on both counts, but Time Machine is where the band finally manages to get everything pretty darn close to perfect.  Having seen them in Birmingham, UK, on the tour, this was the best sound quality I've seen them have live, and they managed to capture that on the disc.  All the instruments show up perfectly in the mix, from the rumbling bass of \\"Leave That Thing Alone\\" to the meaty synths at the beginning of \\"Subdivisions\\" for the low end to Neil's cymbals throughout the DVD and Alex's guitar on \\"La Villa Strangiato\\".  The video quality also is top-notch; it really does replicate the experience of being there live (or as close as you can get).<br /><br />I've seen a few reviews criticizing a perceived \\"jumpiness\\" in the video editing.  That's somewhat justified; I'd describe the editing much like I'd describe the band's music--hyperkinetic.  Not enough to warrant dropping a star from the review, but I do wish that they would have stayed with a single camera view a little longer during some of the solos.<br /><br />The closest thing to a criticism (and this isn't why I purchase a DVD), the \\"extras\\" are a little scanty compared to previous DVD's like Snakes and Arrows.<br /><br />To sum everything up, if you are a Rush fan (or are looking to purchase this for one), you won't be disappointed.would have stayed with a single camera view a little longer during some of the solos.

B0000027RL|5.0|On August 27, 1991 Epic records released one of the most important albums in modern rock.  They didn't know it at the time.  Not even Pearl Jam knew it.  Especially that was the attitude in 1991 because the album didn't sell great at the start.  But once 1992 rolled around it was sitting at #2 atop the Billboard 200 chart.  Now it is considered an epic and giant moment in rock history.  Does it deserve such high praise?<br />Indeed it does.  Eddie Vedder's lyrics and vocals fit perfectly with the music.  While compared to Nirvana often since they are both Seattle bands, Pearl Jam were more of a straight up rock group then grunge.  When one thinks of grunge, I personally think of grinding guitars and punk rock sensibilities.  Think Nirvana and Alice in Chains.  Or even Godsmack know still uses a grunge tone.  And while those bands have made some amazing music, Pearl Jam was a little more complex than just a grunge sound.  The album is technically (I mean musically) a gem.  Stone Gossard's guitar work is very evident on the album and Mike McCready is in top form.  I agree with the other reviewers that you can definitely hear Led Zeppelin and other classic rock influences on the record.<br />Lyrically the cd is very dark.  Vedder talks about things such as loneliness, depression,suicide and even murder.  At the same time, it has a sort of unflagging optimism that the future will be brighter.<br />The songs \\"Alive,\\" and \\"Once\\" are part of a trilogy of songs which tell a story.  (The third song is \\"Footsteps\\" but isn't on \\"Ten.\\"  It was included on the \\"Jeremy\\" single B-Side.)  It follows the story of a young man learning his father has already died without his knowledge.  He is subsequently brought into a sexual relationship instigated by his mother and even becomes a murderer.  He is captured in the final song and executed.  Ironically many people considered \\"Alive\\" a optimistic song full of hope.  Easy to make that mistake....Obviously not a cd that is great for kids.  But if you are old enough to handle it, a great rock album.<br /><br />Yes the cd is now over 10 years old.  But it still remains just as powerful today.  Grunge may not rule the radio anymore, but this gold nugget has stood the test of time.  Two thumbs way up.are old enough to handle it, a great rock album.  Yes the cd is now over 10 years old.

B000002IZ4|5.0|By this point in STP's career they had made 1 grungy rock album that had been panned by the critics as a rip off cd.  But it had struck a note with the public leading them to begin recording a follow up.  It was released on June 7th, 1994.  The record followed a lot of the same territory that the first did with plenty f grunge and hard rock sensibilities.  Even with that said though, the subtle shift to psychedelic rock can be seen here as well (i.e. \\"Lounge Fly\\").  It went on to sell over 6 million copies.  But does the cd live up to the hype when played?  Let's go through it track by track... (1 to 5 scale)<br /><br />1.  \\"Meatplow\\"  4.9  Solid start to the cd.  Weird lyrics and grinding guitars let you know STP is back baby.<br />2.  \\"Vasoline\\"  5.0  Another rock staple.  The heavy effects at the start are very memorable.<br />3.  \\"Lounge Fly\\"  4.2  STP's first foray into psychedelic rock.  It works moderately well.  Only profanity on the album is heard on this track.<br />4.  \\"Interstate Love Song\\"  5.0  Probably the best song on the whole album.  A groove with a cool melody and great lyrics to match.  And the video is good too.  There is nothing negative I can say about this song.<br />5.  \\"Still Remains\\"  4.3  A beautiful love song.  My mom always thought the \\"Take a bath, I'll drink the water that you leave\\" line was gross.  But in some weird ways you can almost relate....<br />6.  \\"Pretty Penny\\"  4.5  Love the opening shimmer to the acoustic guitar.  Another psychedelic song.  Not heavy at all.  And perfectly placed on the cd.<br />7.  \\"Silvergun Superman\\"  4.9  STP show they have still have the hard rock chops.  The lyrics are cool.  Hearing a pig whisper sweetly....pretty cool.  Guitar work is great too.<br />8.  \\"Big Empty\\"  5.0  This song was also on The Crow soundtrack.  And also appeared on their unplugged special on MTV.  Excellent song.  Love the slide guitar.  STP went country on this one and still rocked it!<br />9.  \\"Unglued\\"  5.0  A straight up rock monster.  Still good to pump your fist too.<br />10.  \\"Army Ants\\"  4.9  No slowing down on this track.  Starts off soft and mellow and then kicks it into hyper drive!<br />11.  \\"Kitchenware & Candybars\\"  3.5  Nothing special about this song.  The hidden song about it being the second album is better than the first song on the track.<br />Total: 51.2 out of 55.0.  Amazing album and totally worth picking up if you don't have it yet.too.  10.  \\"Army Ants\\"  4.9  No slowing down on this track.

B003Y7AR7C|5.0|Bought this because we missed a chance to see a showing of this near where we live. Bought the DVD. My 8 yr old daughter, who is taking dance LOVED it! Great DVD for a great price.
B006MHWXMS|4.0|I like it. Works with LG Optimus V.  Works without sync with Gmail account. Very handy.  I have been using a calendar app so it has become difficult to decide if I will use this.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Free download for my Fire and am enjoying it. Not too many ads but I sure don't win very often!
B0063GORYU|5.0|I really enjoy this game! Its very addictive and fun. I enjoy the levels of difficulty and playing on my new kindle fire!
B006MHWXMS|3.0|It's a fancy to-do list. I would rather this synced with Google calander, as I'm having trouble finding a calender app that does for the Fire. Uninstalled.

B001GCUO5M|5.0|I saw this movie yesterday, and it was the type of movie I was looking for. It is mind twisting, but doesn't confuses you. It is like a Twilight Zone kind of story. There is a twist in the story from beginning to end, which makes you keep wondering what would happen next. The movie is long, but it should take long to tell this story, and most of the scene didn't feel like a fill-in. If you like this, also check out Triangle.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|this cover fits Kindle Fire very well, contrary to some of the reviews I read.  Very nice quality for a non-leather case.  Love the color.
B003ELMR9E|1.0|If you find yourself falling asleep when there's too much talking, stay away from this movie. The only reason why I watched it was because of those two famous actor, and I saw that the reviews were decent. I watched up until they both met up on the ferry, after that, I just fell asleep while they were talking. I mean, a girl was murder, BIG FREAKING DEAL! that's almost half the crime movies out there. A couple of other things happen too, I'm not going to spoil it, but it was not interesting at all. The story was lame, and very, very uninteresting. Don't expect much action or thrills, it is just two guys sorta threatening and confusing each other, in other words, talk talk talk... That fact that Al Pacino was insomniac for most of the movie, made me doze off even more.
B00000I8BX|5.0|I had seen/heard Fear Factory for the first time in 1995 opening for Megadeth.  Thought they were really good for what sounded like a industrial death metal band.  Then Obsolete came out and they put tempo in their music and became one of my favorite bands.  PROS: Great metal music and the vocals have so much range that you get many emotions while listening.  Their cover of Cars is great.  Resurrection is possibly the best song followed by Desent but the CD is good from the beginning.  Shock is a great opening song.  CONS: none  Just get it if you're a metal head.  They are right there along with the likes of Machine Head and Mudvayne.

B004529NLG|1.0|While I got the movie primarily for what I hoped would be cool dance sequences, everything about the movie was disappointing - from the ridiculous plot to the performances.  Quite honestly, even the choreography was filmed badly.  The technical quality of the 3D was fine - but nothing else was interesting in the movie.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. It showed up fast and in good condition. I don't remember this film being so scary and depressing but it is definitely moving. I would recommend it to anybody. It's an intimate and interesting story of human nature and the addictions that everyone adheres to on a daily basis; whether it be fame, food, money, or dope. Tragic.
0312641893|5.0|Make no mistake, this is no common Cinderella story, this is Cinderella...the new and improved version. When I read the book description the first thoughts that went through my mind were \\"Another Cinderella story?\\", \\"Cinderella is a Cyborg?\\", and \\"Lunar people?\\". All these doubts were put aside though as I read through the book and fell completely and utterly in love with the spunky and tenacious Cinder, our heroine.<br /><br />Cinder is not a regular girl, she isn't even fully human, at least 36.28% of her. Having been turned Cyborg (human with mechanical parts and improvements) at a young age, and having no recollection of the event, Cinder has 1 (not 2) wicked step-sister and a step-mother that can make anyone cry. Cinder would cry at all her step-mother makes her go through, except her tear ducts were removed during her cyborg operation, giving people the impression that she has no emotion, something that couldn't be farther from the truth. Cinder having a mechanical leg and hand, which she covers up with pants and gloves, struggles with not being able to fit in with those that know what she is.<br /><br />One fine day, she meets Prince Kai, who comes in to her shop seeking her services as a mechanic. He is unaware of Cinder's situation but is instantly smitten with her. In the meantime, there is a plague ravaging the planet, taking people's lives in a matter of day. Without a cure found, the government of New Beijing has resorted to drafting cyborgs to use a test subjects to find a cure, forcing them to risk their lives for the rest of humanity. Cinder's other step-sister, the one who is not evil, falls ill and Cinder is volunteered as a test subject by her evil step-mother. The series of events that happen after poses a very curious and difficult situation for Cinder and puts her again in Prince Kai's path. Is she immune to the plague and why? Does she hold answer to the cure to the plague deep in her DNA? Does she reveal to Kai that she is in fact a Cyborg?<br /><br />This book was so good it's hard to put into words and do it justice. An excellent debut by Marissa Meyer. I'm excited to read the upcoming books in this series and I highly recommend it for any age. Absolutely a must read. I give it 5 stars because it definitely blew me away.d it's hard to put into words and do it justice. An excellent debut by Marissa Meyer.

B003MC5N28|5.0|I am sad to say that I have never read this book in all my 32 years until now.  I am so glad that I did- and have heartily and honestly recommened to everyone I have met- it is stunning.  Lowry has created a future that exists just outside the realm of possibility with its edge of magic, but also sits firmly in possibility with its ideals, operations, and view of \\"sameness\\" that permeates the book.  Her writing is fresh, flows well, and carries the reader along at an amazing pace that builds tension well and guide the reader at the same time.  We discover secrets, lies, half truths, and painful realities at the same rate as the protagonist, Jonas- and in doing so, we bond with him, share his sadness and feel his burdens as well.  The hallmark of a great book is one that makes you forget yourself and instead you become absorbed in the story- \\"The Giver\\" does all of that- and in such a way as to be satisfying and mysterious at the same time.  While the subject matter has been challenged, banned, and even demonized- the book is powerful and deserves to be read on those merits alone.  While it could be a harsh warning, character piece, or even just a light bit of sci-fi story telling, it is a timely book that will (hopefully) make one look at the world around them and see what is important, beautiful, special, and necessary in being different, being human, feeling emotion, and experiencing life.  I recommend this book to everyone and really feel that it is a masterpiece of modern literature.  The hardcover is on order, and will sit firmly on my \\"must read\\" shelf permanetly.  I want to let the story sink in and percolate a bit- but I can't wait to read it again.  What an amazing, stunning, and overall satisfying piece of fiction.  One of the BEST books I have ever read.  *NOTE: there are some scenes in the book that are difficult, but necessary in the revelations of the society and its rules.  Be warned that they might be hard to handle.*

B00003ZKS1|5.0|This album showcases Michael's prowess as a soloist...very often. The 'Armed' solo shoots out of the gates and will just leave your jaw hanging. 'Nations' starts as a tropical paradise sounding tune, where you feel the need for a Pina Colada in hand, then the bomb drops and it kicks in heavy. 'Into The Arena' is a cool instrumental with a couple of very nice solos. Barden's voice is strong as always; and Powell/Glenn keep the bottom end down tight. Raymond shows up throughout as well adding textures and extra guitars. Overall, a very strong album...highly recommended!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|best game ever too good for free but its hard to stop when someone tells you to stop. so fun and addictive.
B001RT89TC|4.0|I purchased this after reading the reviews and figured Bonnet could only make MSG sound better; I was right. With Bonnet in the fold, the whole dynamic of the band's sound changed. It seemed less gritty and more serious about it's approach to song/riff writing. Every band that Bonnet's been in seems to feed off of his theatrical voice and make statements, not mere songs; as if they can take each title to another level. Schenker's playing is in very fine form...furious in spots and restrained where it needs to be. Just hearing some of the chordal voicings and phrases he used on this album impressed me...it adds textures that are missing on previous albums. A couple of outro solos should have been extended, as Schenker really gets into his groove but I guess the engineer figured 'that's enough'. Martin Birch produced and engineered this effort (Iron Maiden, BOC...etc) and you can hear the difference. Highly polished without being overproduced. I gave it 4 Stars, only becuase it could have rocked a bit more in spots, but overall a must-have for Schenker fans, and definitely woth having.

0385342055|2.0|Dear Ms. Wickham (aka Kinsella),    Becky's shopping problem was a great fatal for Becky's character, but I am really disappointed to see that Becky's character has not evolved as real humans do.  I had hoped that mini-shopaholic would have been more about her transformation into a flawed but maturing mother, but instead both you and Becky treat the child as an accessory to her story.  If you write another book in this series, you must show depth in the character from the beginning.  Have Becky take lessons home from this and previous books into the next book.  Furthermore, stop the supporting characters simply enabling her in the next book.  I have been reading your books for years, but I am close to calling it quits.

159562015X|2.0|I bought this book with an intention of learning a great deal more than I did, regarding my own personality type in the business field.  The Book, Strengths Finder, by Tom Rath,is probably exactly what it says it is, when it is bought brand new.  I made the mistake of buying a used copy.  This time, it was a mistake, because I had not seen it in a book store, first.  If I had, I would have seen the clear warning, not to buy it, if the code in it had already been used to discover, online, the strengths of an another individual.
B004HV54TU|5.0|I LOVE this mouse.  Instantaneously compatible and feels completely natural.  After 8 hours of working, NO MORE WRIST/HAND PAIN~! If you are contemplating purchasing this mouse, do not hesitate-place your order now.  It is definitely worth every penny if you spend a lot of time at your computer and use a mouse.  The programmable buttons are a big plus for me, but even if this mouse did not come with this feature it would still be the best thing since sliced bread to me.  For those concerned about the small size, using the provided guide for measurement, my hand measured exactly 7 inches, thus I bought the smaller hand size as recommended.  It's a perfect fit.

B004SH40BQ|4.0|though no fault of the adapter, it drains the iPod's ([[ASIN:B002M3SO0G Apple iPod nano 16 GB Graphite (6th Generation) NEWEST MODEL]]) battery dry in about two hours of continuous play.  Also, I've experienced some music \\"cut outs\\" while playing songs that didn't happen when I used wired headphones.  I'm guessing this either may be due to the power of the Bluetooth signal and the wireless headset's receiver being behind my neck or possibly interference from other devices transmitting on the same frequency around me.  I got the adapter because I kept stretching the wire on the regular headphones and eventually causing them to break and, also, because I didn't like the irritating feel of the wire running along my arm when I wear my iPod as a watch, which is all the time.  My iPod's watch band ([[ASIN:B004FEEZHQ iWatchz CLRCHR22BLK Q Collection Wrist Strap for iPod Nano 6G, Black]]) cradle positions the accessory port along my arm, rather than perpendicular to arm, as some do, and plugging the adapter into the port when it is facing away from my wrist doesn't in any way interfere with my wrist or arm movements, so it is comfortable and doesn't look any worse than having a headphone plugged into the iPod audio jack.  The adapter centers on the side of the iPod, which is nice, but does stick out just a bit over a half an inch or 1.5 cm from the side of the iPod.  The adapter has a little blue indicator next to the Bluetooth symbol that lights up, but there is no syncing button or physical controls of on the adapter.  The device works fine with my Motorola S10-HD Wireless Bluetooth Headphones ([[ASIN:B004BHCSQC Motorola S10-HD Bluetooth Stereo Headphones[Retail Packaging]]]) and supports all of the music player functions.

B005KA188S|4.0|Just as I expected.  It was in the style of the original.  I will say that they picked the right actors to play the parts.  Colin Farrell as the vampire is seductive and frightening at the same time.  David Tennant as the Vegas magician Peter Vincent is great as the humorous side-kick for the \\"kid\\", Charley Brewster.  The Peter Vincent character has shades of The 10th Doctor's irreverence showing through at times.  (David Tennant really should do more comedy.)  Anton Yelchin is great as the scared \\"kid\\", Charley Brewster.  And, Toni Collette certainly plays the clueless mom.  Good special effects.  All-in-all, a tolerable remake and very watchable.
B004XWLN20|5.0|I bought this Smallville boxed set for my 15 year old daughter for Christmas and it was by far her favorite gift.  She has watched all ten seasons of Smallville on the internet, but is watching them again with the rest of the family on these DVDs.  We're all enjoying watching them as a family.  This is a beautiful two-boxed set of 10 seasons (Seasons 1-5 in one box and 6-10 in the second box).  It includes extra footage such as gag reels, commentary and a show containing commentary from all the women that have played Lois Lane in the different Supermans, talking about being Lois.  It also contains a companion book and a copy of the Daily Planet (pretty cool).  I highly recommend this if you have a Smallville fan in the house.
B006MHWXMS|3.0|Nice little app, will give it a try for a few days and see if it can keep me on course. Didn't try sync to google because I don't use it. I only have one cause my phone required it. Agree with others, there are people who still use Outlook and other calendars who need apps like this. Would be better if it were open to whatever calendar you use.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love it but.in my opinion you should not update  it because if you do it sucks. but its super fun and very entertaining!
B004UG7RQ0|5.0|Since I work in an office where any kind of streaming is blocked, I desperately wanted to find a way to stream Pandora or radio stations during my long work days. I have the older generation Bose iPod docking station (like others who have reviewed this product), and while it sounds great, I could only use my iPods with it. I occasionally tire of listening to the same songs over and over again on my iPod Video. My iPod Nano is great and offers FM radio streaming, but the (female) port that goes on the docking station is immediately adjacent to the headphone jack, and without the headphones connected as an antenna there's no radio reception. Thus, I still longed for something more.<br /><br />Enter the dockBoss! I received the Smart Audio Input Adaptor as a gift. My first day back to work, I plugged the female adaptor onto my Bose docking station, then connected the headphone (3.5 mm) male audio connector to my smart phone (Android OS, HTC Incredible). I launched my Pandora app on my phone  - and voila! - music from Pandora on my Bose speakers! My smart phone also has an FM radio app, so if I tire of Pandora (or exhaust my time limit), I can switch to a local FM radio station.<br /><br />I'm thrilled to have a relatively inexpensive solution that actually works! I didn't have to go out and buy a separate docking station for my phone, or a new Bose one that has a headphone jack input (like the newer models do). My Bose remote still works for volume control too! (I just have to go to my phone to turn it off completely, which is no big deal.) Hooray for innovative products like the dockBoss!

0393974650|5.0|The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Steven­son is a novella writ­ten by the Scot­tish born author. The 1886 work is con­sid­ered a clas­sic of British literature.<br /><br />Pros­e­cu­tor Gabriel John Utter­son has taken cer­tain inter­est in Mr. Edward Hyde even since he tram­pled a lit­tle girl. The crowd gath­ered forced Mr. Hyde to make ret­ri­bu­tion, how­ever the check he gave the girl was signed by Dr. Henry Jekyll.<br /><br />Mr. Utter­son also dis­cov­ers that Mr. Hyde is the sole ben­e­fi­ciary of all of Dr. Jekyll's wealth. Utter­son tries to dis­cuss the mat­ter of Mr. Hyde with the good doc­tor which, as one might guess, doesn't yield any results.<br /><br />A year later a mem­ber of the British Par­lia­ment is mur­dered and the maid iden­ti­fies Mr. Hyde. Utter­son con­fronts Dr. Jekyll who shows the lawyer a let­ter in which Mr. Hyde states that he is will dis­ap­pear forever.<br /><br />Some­time later, sus­pect­ing foul play Utter­son breaks into Dr. Jekyll's house where they dis­cover Mr. Hyde who has just com­mit­ted sui­cide by drink­ing poi­son.  Through let­ters Utter­son pieces together Dr. Jekyll's dou­ble life.<br /><br />The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde by Robert Louis Steven­son is a well known novella which deals with split per­son­al­ity.<br /><br />I found it inter­est­ing that the book has only two set­tings, let­ters and lab­o­ra­tory. Not the clean, ster­ile lab­o­ra­tory we imag­ine, but a dis­gust­ing, dirty and bloody one which implores the reader to feel the Gothic hor­ror which the author wishes to con­vey. In this envi­ron­ment is where Mis­ter Hyde is cre­ated, a trou­bled fig­ure, mean and unabated.<br /><br />Mis­ter Hyde is what Dr. Jekyll wants to be but sup­presses within him­self. Hyde yearns for vio­lence and sex­u­al­ity, he is full of strength, uncar­ing and out of con­trol - or is he actu­ally in full con­trol?<br />Mr. Hyde cel­e­brates the nature of men unhin­dered by social norms, rules or laws while Dr. Jekyll self cen­sors him­self as a proper gen­tle­man should in Vic­to­rian England.<br /><br />As time goes on, this novella could be read in sev­eral ways. There is the most known one, that of split per­son­al­ity, but also could be a patho­log­i­cal angle of inves­ti­gat­ing the nature of men­tal ill­ness.  In these days, where sci­ence, tech­nol­ogy and med­i­cine is much more advanced, the story could also be read as a warn­ing on the extreme use of mind alter­ing chem­i­cals, drugs or alco­hol and the self destruc­tive prop­er­ties of such actions.<br /><br />But Dr. Jekyll & Mr. Hyde could also be read as a phi­los­o­phy book which deals with the knowl­edge that we are all on death's door. Death, in this case, is rep­re­sented as a man of flesh and blood. A psy­cho­an­a­lyst could also, some­what jus­ti­fi­ably, could read the story as the psy­chotic and nar­cis­sist fan­tasy of Dr. Jekyll.<br /><br />I found the book's sub­ject dis­turb­ing, not because of the mur­der or Goth involved, but more on a psy­cho­log­i­cal level. The pos­si­bil­ity of every indi­vid­ual lead­ing a dou­ble life is a scary thought, espe­cially when it comes to loved ones. How often, when a grotesque mur­der occurs, we hear the almost laugh­able lines \\"he was such a nice guy\\" or \\"she was a won­der­ful mother\\"?<br /><br />Another side of the story, and I say that as a fan of Mr. Stevenson's work since an early age, I can cer­tainly see a pat­tern of com­men­tary on Vic­to­rian Eng­land where, as is today, a person's wealth and social stand­ing relieves them of any moral oblig­a­tions towards their fel­low men or women.by social norms, rules or laws while Dr. Jekyll self cen­sors him­self as a proper gen­tle­man should in Vic­to­rian England.

034552554X|5.0|Poignant and beautiful.  It was really moving and emotional without being too sappy. You fall in love with the character and want more.  Praise to the author, keep writing Vanessa and we'll keep reading.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Works perfectly on my G2. Deducted one star because it is ad supported and therefore not actually free but the ads only pop up when you deal and most are skipped with one touch. The market version has slightly more intrusive ads so i recommend against automatic updating.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|I read this series in about a week.  I absolutely could not put it down.  I think it is very well written and I am glad I bought it as a bundle, because I was able to just begin the next one after I finished the previous.  I was never interested in this series, although I saw so many people carrying the book with them.  I decided to read a sample and immediately got the whole thing.  The characters are great and I am sad there will not be any more books in this series.  Please read, you will not be sad that you did.
B005UG542S|1.0|So I read all of your reviews and, because of all your suggestions, went to the Amazon.com UK site and ordered the set that SAID it was region free. And a month later I get it, and guess what? It won't play on my DVD player - I just keep getting a message on the screen that says \\"wrong region.\\" Great. So it was a Christmas gift for the kids which didn't even arrive on time, and when it does, it doesn't work, and the price to ship back to the UK is the same as the cost of the set. Great, just great.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much fun, and there are so many things to work toward. I'm having so much fun.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|Solid app does what it says.  One hundredth of a version behind.androids market deserves one star?  Talk about stupid. Minimum words
B006MHWXMS|2.0|How can I trust this app when it thinks there are 32 days in January? And it is annoying and unsettling that is asks me to enter my Google username and password rather than accessing my existing Google account already provided in the Android settings.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is so fun and addicting it has games i couldnt have imagined its great  and has a lot of variety :)
B002N1AF7W|4.0|This is one of my favorite albums. The only thing about this album that knocks it off a star is that there are only a few tracks. What I bought this album was for the songs \\"The Man Machine\\" and \\"The Robots\\". The other songs are very average by their standards. But the two tracks mentioned are some of the best by this group. Too bad they don't have a greatest hits compilation or anthology. The ones I have are either remixes which are not better than the original or live recordings. I am sorry but Kraftwerk does not sound better live. I prefer their studio versions as I go for the sound. I am a fan of Kraftwerk but would not purchase tickets to see their live shows. They are not particularly a show type of band as they are more recording artists. Another thing is that I notice that the price for this album is generally high so if you are looking for this album be prepared to cough up some dough for few tracks and old album.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I've been looking for a game that would hold my interest, challenge me and last longer than an hour or two....quell does all of these things and more! I play before turning in at night which makes it a great relaxer before I pick up the latest book on my reading list. If you're looking for a great game....check out quell you'll be glad you did!
B006MHWXMS|5.0|Powerful yet simple task app. Solid design and very well coded. Its very smooth and just feels great to use.
B002SJKWZ4|4.0|Very cool, well build product. A bit hard to do some of the movements, rotating being the hardest. Not a complete replacement for a remote but a very nice talking piece for guests.
0307454541|5.0|The first installment of Stieg Larsson's trilogy did not disappoint.  He took time to lay out the characters and foundation for his tale.  The middle and end of the book was full of page turning excitement.  Can't wait to read the next two installments of this trilogy.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|had much higher expectations. the game is very simplistic and reptitive. theres not much to the game. got boring fast. all in all, ive played better flash games on the internet when i was a kid
030745455X|5.0|The second book of the Stieg Larsson series did not disappoint.  Many unpredictable twists and turns left me wondering how the book would turn out and the ending was fantastic.  I can't wait to begin the third book!
B004G6009K|5.0|This was a wonderful movie! We had the opportunity to see it on the big screen, but were not able to see it in 3D at that time. We were given a 3D tv for Christmas, and so we invested in a Blu-ray player. This was our first 3D movie purchase, and it was AMAZING! The only gripe I have with the purchase is that it comes with a digital copy, which I had issues trying to get it to install, and now it says that I have used up my code. I never got my digital copy, and I did not know you were only given three chances to install it. That sucks. Aside from that, I am very happy with this movie, just wish the prices of these things were a little cheaper.
B0006L16N8|4.0|Good service.  It was packaged in a bubble wrap envelope which what I would have done but unfortunately the jewel case hasd two large cracks in it when delivered.  I will replace the jewel case anyway.
B002JVWR4A|5.0|This is a desired product, but I had to retorn the first shipment because it contained several defective disks. That is always a pain!
B005TPCQ5I|1.0|Boring...... horrible British accents....dull characters.  I have to admit, I got this because of Hathaway, but I couldn't even finish the movie. Very disappointed in her decision to do this movie. Times must be tough.
B004NSULHM|4.0|This is the band's most mature release so far, but don't expect to find a single hook or anything you can hum along with. Though I've listened a dozen times, I still couldn't name a single track on it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|this solitaire app is easy to use and fun. what more do you need?  have fun! this is the only solitaire app I own.
159514188X|5.0|I read \\"Thirteen Reasons...\\" before Christmas to determine whether or not to send it to my grand-daughter, age 12 and 1/2, in middle school.  Since bullying is such a problem in schools, and because I can also recall how it manifested itself in the late 1950s (remember \\"Slam Books\\"?) I really wanted to give her something to think about as she walks the halls of adolescence.  I have decided to wait until she is a bit older to pass it along to her, and have confirmed this decision in a conversation with her mother.  The only reason for this is two scenes near the end of the book that are of a sexual nature, one a rape, although those events were an integral part of the story.   The book is an easy read, but does not \\"write down\\" to the reader. The perspective coming from a young male narrator is a stroke of genius, and helps the story ring very true. The portrayal of teen relationships, the \\"new-girl-in-town\\" syndrome, the virtual absence of adult intrusion in the story, and the strong presence of teen politics, present a story that teen readers will easily identify with. That makes this book a powerful tool in the fight against bullying, the development of greater empathy, and realization of the finality of suicide.  Highly recommended.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I thought Youversion??? But it isn't some new version, but contains all the main versions you'd want. Including Kjv Nib Nas! And it has many plans including One-Year and keeps track of your progress. And it will read itcto you in many of versions. It's tiger greatest thing about my new Kindle Fire so far!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|the mini-games are fun, but I wish there weren't so many ads and some of the games are hard to understand at first....but that makes it interesting I guess
B005TBN3EU|1.0|This is just an excuse for a sequel and has no redeeming qualities. The characters have been robbed of their personalities and the humor is non-existant. Very disappointing.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|this is a well designed puzzle that will make you think!  A great way to kill five minutes or a whole hour!
B004XCUEU2|5.0|It really doesn't get any better than the Foo Fighters and this DVD will make any Foo fan super pleased. It's a GREAT DVD and it shows you even more how talented this band really is. I would definitely recommend this to any rock fan and obviously to any Foo fan!
B003H6KRIE|5.0|The Bourne Trilogy Blue Ray Set was an awesome buy! All 3 blue rays together in one set. It was a great christmas gift for my husband.
B0041KKYGU|3.0|This definitely has it's funny parts. It's not agonizing in any way to watch. But if you are expecting for it to end up being one of your all time favorite comedies, I hope you have pretty low standards. Cameron Diaz is pretty good in it and it makes you crack up because of how horrible she really is as a teacher. She does some incredibly messed up (in a funny way) things in this, but overall, it's not going to have you curled over laughing. But if you are looking to get it when it's on sale for 5 or 6 bucks, you will easily get your money's worth and also, dont' forget to enjoy the car wash scene ;)
B000FS9MV0|5.0|Skylark is Renee Olstead's best album to date. Full of fun ups and downs, while a full spectrum of feelings course through this album. It is a pleasure to listen to, both the vocals and the instrumental backup which mesh together well. I think it is a far more polished musical presentation than Renee's first album. The backup musicians really have more talent this time around. Can't wait for her next one !
B006MHWXMS|3.0|It is free. Not a bad app, more of a sad app. In order to use this you can really only have one google account. you can sign out of one and into another but what a pain that is. I like the Google Tasks Organizer Lite much better.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|I figure if I'm going to spend $199 for the Kindle Fire, I'm going to protect it and carry it in a nice looking cover, which reflects my personality. This cover fit the bill! I really like it and am enjoying it very much. It is a great fit and serves the purpose of protecting my Kindle Fire. The color is a dull red (which I like better than a bright red) and the names of the cities on the cover are a nice touch. If you like to travel or like me, you dream of traveling more, the cover is inspirational. I am glad I made this purchase.
0439023521|5.0|I have suggested or given this series to over 10 people! Buy it, read it, live it, love it. You will NOT be able to put this down. Read the first Chapter - You will finish all 3 books in a week!!!!
B004SH40BQ|5.0|Small easy to set up and works great!  Nothing to complain about. Works fine with my 6th Gen Nano on a wristband.  h.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Easy to use and flows smoothly.  No bugs that I could find.  However, I would like the ability to limit the &quot;undo&quot; feature to just one move.  It seems a little like cheating to be able to go back as far as you want.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|If you enjoy a book that brings you into another world that after the first chapter  ..well the world goes on hold. A delightful read. Magic is real as one who works with  folks that present events that only their magical world would allow to develop so they may tolerate the difficulties life has brought to them. I seldom find a story that can captivate me from page one to the end. Enjoy this well written book and hope there will be more to follow from this author. Bravo. P.J. Today
B006MHWXMS|1.0|Force close EVERY time. Does not work past the initial install. Thunderbolt. Fix this app or take it off the market, otherwise it is junk.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|The book was interesting, morbid, easy read.   I would not allow my child to read this book, way too brutal. Maybe a 15+ year old child.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I enjoy this game. It is one of the better ones that I have down loaded to my Kindle Fire to help pass the time when I have to wait for the kids to get out of school, or waiting at a doctors offce.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|great for kindle, very intertwining and fun would really recommend it to pass the time when there's nothing to do
144234430X|4.0|After reading many of the book reviews for 11/22/63 and noting how slow many readers found the middle of the book, I would like to suggest to future readers to listen to the audio book.  Professional actor, Craig Wasson, does a superb job transforming pulp to voice.  He sees to it that each and every character has his or her own voice.  The main character of Jake (George)sounds like a soft spoken un-caricatured young Jimmy Stewart. In his voice repertoire we'll hear the resonance of Sheldon Leonard, John Houseman, Richard Nixon, Christopher Lloyd and many others, as tho' they were doing the voiceovers.    I love the story and while it may be tedious reading the vocal textures do relieve some of that tedium.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|Electric Mist is an excellent Film. You won't be disappointed.  There were so many top quality actors in this. John Goodman shows us just how good a bad guy he can play. However, the story is the real star though.  Its interesting to see the many different views of the same events shown from the eyes of the various characters as well as the past and present. And most importantly, how different those views can be.  Recommended.

0062082353|5.0|What a remarkable story of heroism, patriotism, and self-sacrifice by an even more remarkable American, Chris Kyle. A Navy SEAL and highly trained sniper, Kyle is even more remarkable in his straightforward admittance that his accomplishments alone are not to be lauded, but the accomplishments and sacrifices of his fellow military men who sacrificed their vision, limbs, and some ultimately their lives in fighting for the freedoms that we often take for granted, yet hold so dear. It may not be much, but here is one American that is forever grateful and thankful to Chris Kyle and ALL of our brave men and women fighting for our country.<br /><br />Kyle joins the ranks of such American sniper greats as Carlos Hathcock 93 confirmed kills during the Vietnam War, and whose sniper exploits were so eloquently related to the reader in these two books written by Charles Henderson; [[ASIN:0425181650 Marine Sniper: 93 Confirmed Kills]] and [[ASIN:0425188647 Silent Warrior: The Marine Sniper's Story Vietnam Continues]], as well as, other sniper greats such as; Chuck Mawhinney a U.S. Marine with 103 confirmed kills during the Vietnam War and Adelbert Waldron the previous U.S. Military record holder with 109 confirmed kills.<br /><br />One particular aspect that I liked about how this book was written was the occasional viewpoint expressed by Kyle's lovely wife, Taya. Although both she and Kyle allude to problems both faced concerning each other and his absence during his military service, one can't help but realize what a truly remarkable women Taya is and Chris is a damn lucky man to have her. I am quite sure that God has and will continue to smile upon the both of them.<br /><br />I really liked Kyle's no apologetic statement that he enjoyed his job and took great pride in saving the lives of his fellow soldiers as they fought against the evils that they found in Iraq. Kyle doesn't go into a lot of gruesome detail concerning that subject but he makes it painfully clear that unless you have actually been there and seen the evil that hasn't been diluted by politicians and the media, then you really have no idea what it is like. I would wholeheartedly agree!<br /><br />Kyle talks about not only his involvement as a Navy SEAL sniper in Iraq, but also his working relationship with other branches of the military. Some real insightful stuff!<br /><br />Kyle not only gives you a glimpse into the world he and his fellow SEAL's lived during the Iraq War, but also the difficulties he faced when he came home in between tours and for good upon his retirement from the Navy. And although there were difficulties, he also shares some very humorous moments as well. I especially liked the story about the \\"burglar\\" breaking into his home while he was on leave and while he was still in bed after his wife left for work. I was laughing so hard that I couldn't stop for several minutes. As a matter of fact I am laughing real hard right now as I type this review. Sorry Chris, I am laughing at you as well as with you on this one. Ha Ha Ha<br /><br />I am not one for posting a lot of spoilers when I do my reviews, but I do have to say that one only needs read a few pages to realize that not only is Chris Kyle one of the finest soldiers the United States of America has every produced, but he is also, and perhaps more importantly, one helluva human being and a truly great American. God Bless!<br /><br />I highly recommend this book to every American as a very inspirational read as well as a biography of one extraordinary human being.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />Martial Artist/Krav Maga Instructor<br />NRA Firearms Instructor<br />Author and Creator of numerous books and DVD's.e and seen the evil that hasn't been diluted by politicians and the media, then you really have no idea what it is like.

B002VECM6S|1.0|Most likely will not purchase anymore DVD's as  this one skipped thru the whole movie and can  not be returned after it was opened. How does  one know if the movie is bad if you don't open  it?????????
B0063IH60K|2.0|I am revising my review, because with recent updates the ads are annoying. Graphics are good. All in all a good game. That said. you can not beat the price.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for my wife who is a big Harry Potter fan.  She has read all the books.  Now she can watch all the movies.  She loves it!  The Blu-Ray quality is excellent.
0375851569|5.0|The books arrived in a timely manner, and they are still as \\"classic\\" as ever.  I bought these same books for my children, and now have bought them for the next generation!
B004EPYZZ8|5.0|Originally saw this in the theater and knew that we would be purchasing it.  It is a great movie for all ages and the shipping was quick as well. Kudos Amazon!!
B006MHWXMS|1.0|Got it today free - but it kept trying to start my GPS and drove me crazy with the GPS blinking.  I uninstalled  the app and no GPS blinking.
B004UID2LC|5.0|Don't know if there was an update or if I was trying to download a video that just couldn't be formatted to MP3, but the app works great now.
B005ZUR724|4.0|The game works fine, if having update issues completely uninstall and reinstall the game.   Its a pretty fun mmo and decent warcraft clone. Previous WOW players will see the similarities.  Either way if you're looking for an mmo on the go, this is the one.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I love this book series!  Once I started the second book, there was no going back-I finished it in less than two days.  It's a thrilling story filled with both romance and action.  The author is amazing at conveying Katniss's emotions through words.  I could feel her despair when she, once again, was thrown into the games. Then, I could feel her anguish as she tried, and failed, to protect Peeta.  In my opinion, Cathing Fire is better than The Hunger Games.  I'm extremely excited for March 23, when the first movie comes to theatres.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|if you read the directions it says you must unlock the other games. Our family has fun with this app and it helps to kill time!
B005D0RDIE|4.0|Rush has never been great at video. Their DVDs are always a little pedestrian. This one is no exception. The editing is not very fancy, the extras seem more like an afterthought, and the packaging is pretty unremarkable. What is remarkable is the music. These guys sound better than ever. Now that they're bigger than God, they have the money and technology to make their sound huge and expansive. Technically, they've never been better. The setlist is excellent, but it is clearly aimed at songs that are easier to sing, and pitched a little lower. It is pretty clear that while Geddy's bass playing is still amazing, he's a little old to be screeching like that banshee he once was. He barely makes it through tracks like Spirit of Radio and 2112. Still, its Rush, and who knows how many more chances we might have to see these guys live. Rush's music is the soundtrack to my life, and when they finally hang it up, a little bit of me will die.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a fun game that your family will enjoy there is a lot of games that are fun but lots of ads
1451627289|2.0|king takes his time traveller to the dallas of 1960 where everyone is a nazi racist pig and the billboards are all right wing nineteen eighty-four thought control. I quickly wrote off this bad purchase and moved on to something less stupid.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Everything is as described ...love it! The ads really aren't too bad and the points really add up pretty fast!
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game...relaxing yet challenging, pleasant background music, long playtime....kind of game you can play, come back to, and not be lost...great timekiller.
B00122MWU6|5.0|This must be purchased as a album and listened in order. Right off the bat, the album presents a live theatrical event by establishing a story. Although I have been unable to fully understand the story line, the music does a great job of narrating each character as they are introduced and interact.  Aside from the use of unusual instruments, I noticed that the artist is not as concerned with rhyming lyrics as most bands. Instead, they seem to place emphasis on how the melody mixes with the meaning of their prose. At times, the language they use make interesting philosophical points. I appreciate that this album make me think.  Upon first listen, a couple songs stood out to me. After a few dozen listens, I must say I enjoy just about every song. I recommend this album to anybody with an open mind and trying to broaden their musical taste. Pop fans need not apply.  In all, a very different experience for me and equally enjoyable. At first, $10 seems an okay price, in hind sight, the album is probably worth well more than that.
B003LD9P4K|5.0|This is excellent material.  See the legendary ELP in concert, and have the best seat in the house.  One better, also see it from angles no one at the concert can see, like from behind the stage or from under the keyboard.  The picture and sound are perfect!    There are a few notable editing mistakes I noticed:  1. At the beginning the editor does not pay enough attention to Keith Emerson, focusing too much on Greg Lake and Carl Palmer.  2. When Emerson grabs a portable keyboard and flames shoot out of it, we only see the very end of the effect.  3. When Palmer takes his T-shirt off during the drum solo, it is missed, and the next thing we see he is shirtless.  I would highly recommend this Blu-ray to any ELP, Jazz, or Prog Rock fan.  The performances are top notch and they are beautifully delivered through this disk.
0446547654|5.0|I have read several of Nicholas Sparks books and have seen some of the movies. I have enjoyed them all. They all have sad endings. That is a little hard to take. I will continue to read more as they come.
0525423656|3.0|I really, really enjoyed Matched and was eager to read Crossed.  Crossed was a bit disappointing, there just isn't much that happens in this book.  It kind of came off as a necessary transition to book 3.  I still enjoyed reading it, but was disappointed that it didn't grab my attention like the first book.<br /><br />Cassia has gotten herself reclassified to the Outer Provinces so that she can search for Ky.  Ky struggles to survive as he is placed in a wartime situation with other Aberrations.  Ky and Cassia both escape their situations and struggle towards each other and towards the rumored rebellion.<br /><br />My above description is pretty much what happens in the whole book.  Cassia and Ky are in bad situations and escape separately with different companions.  The story switches between Ky and Cassia's viewpoints.  Cassia basically chases Ky in a series of near misses for a good portion of the book.  This is frustrating because there is that whole, \\"oh, if she had just been a little quicker she would have found him\\" thing going on.  When they finally do meet up there are so many secrets between them that relationship felt a bit flat to me.  Ky and Cassia constantly preach that they can't live without each other but when it comes to what really drives them towards their goals they have completely different ideas about what to do.<br /><br />Xander is in the story very little, yet has more impact on the story in the end than Ky does.  Xander has a big secret which is revealed to the reader late in the book.<br /><br />This whole book is basically the story of how Cassia and Ky escape the society and hunt down the rebellion.  Seems like a good basis but so much of the book is spent with them trudging around trying to decide what to do.  A number of new characters are introduced as well; they are interesting characters but are never filled out all that well.<br /><br />All the complaining aside.  I still really did enjoy Condie's way with words; she has some beautiful writing and beautiful descriptions in this book...it is all just very deliberately paced.  I really do enjoy Cassia as a character as well; she has a drive and a brightness to her that draws me in.<br /><br />Secrets about the Society are revealed but despite this I still feel like more questions were created than answered.  This again left me with a feeling of not much happening by the end of the book.  The ending itself left me feeling a bit empty as well; it was just so anti-climatic.<br /><br />Overall this was an okay book.  The writing is beautiful and some of the descriptions absolutely wonderful; Cassia is a great character.  We learn more background on Ky, meet some new characters, and learn more about the Society.  Despite all of this I felt the story progressed slowly, didn't answer many questions, and that not much happened.  The ending was anti-climatic and although I finished the book, the whole thing kind of left me with a \\"Huh, so what\\" feeling in the end.  This seemed like a necessary transition book and in the end I feel like we didn't make much ground in this story.  I will read the final book because I am curious to see what happens, but I was disappointed that this book didn't suck me in like Matched did.is book...it is all just very deliberately paced.

B003UESJH4|5.0|This is a brilliant movie with Colin Firth playing at his best. And Geoffrey Rush in an unforgettable performance. The whole thing was tastefully presented and created a great empathy for King George thrown into a position that he never wanted and with a speech impediment that made him feel totally inadequate. Well Done and Well worth watching recommend to anyone.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|I told myself when I got my Kindle that I wouldn't buy any apps, but WOW! If you don't buy Quell you will be missing out! The perfect combination of action and intellect. I definitely recommend Quell.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I enjoyed this app very very very much. the games are fun and challenging, but do-able. There are lots of opportunities to gain points.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|I thought this game or games was creative and challenging, however I have not yet unlocked too many of the games.  I would like this more if all games were able to be played from the start
B004GYY714|1.0|This App. is by far one of the best I have down loaded on my Kindle Fire. I was really amazed at the different choices of entertainment programs available. You cannot go wrong with this App.,  and it was in my budget, FREE

B000K09OL6|5.0|When I purchased these blocks I wasn't really sure about them.  My daughter had recommended them as a Christmas gift for our two granddaughters, just turned 8 and a little bit past 5.  I knew, however, how much they enjoy blocks and building and make believe because we have bought them several different kinds and types of blocks in the past.  Well, needless to say, the blocks were a big Christmas hit.  Even their Mom and Dad have gotten into the act.  I am sure we'll buy other Kapla block products in the future.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|I don't really have a favorite out of the three - this one has a few slow parts but the action scenes are pretty amazing.

0385535139|2.0|John Grisham has not written an interesting book since \\":The Firm.\\" and 'Pelican Brief\\" except \\" Bleachers\\". And don't tell me that \\"A Time to Kill\\" was his best book. Maybe I will give him a  B for \\"Playing for Pizza\\". This book is one in a long list of dogs. I think Grisham fans keep buying his books hoping for the old magic. In the Litigators it is interesting that a lawyer would drop out of a big Chicago firm, get drunk in a bar eating onion rings and talking to a rich old lady and eventually being dumped on the shores of Findley and Fig a down and out two man firm. But the book moved slowly and never built up any tension. As a lawyer who knows how the big firm sweat shops work, it was interesting that someone would dump that life before it rolls you. But I was hoping for a tense trial with twists and turns. It never happened. But I guess one could say it was a mellow book best read will much wine.     If you like Grisham read \\"Bleachers\\", it is his best work.  In Bleachers you have excellent character development, a return to old glory of championship high school football and of course an appeal to anyone who played or enjoys high school football. I highly recommend the audio version.     All I can say is John, \\"Show us the old magic and literary effort. We do know good stuff when we read it.\\"  Crayon, Louisville, Ky
1416550550|5.0|A friend recommended this book from her book club and all expectations turned to reality.  It is a winding story with so many interesting twists.  It is a novel and fiction doesn't always go along the lines of true status in the 1900's.  Don't be so picky about a wonderfully woven message of love, devotion, and dedication to family and friends.  I highly recommend this book to others.  Most intriguing was the answer to the mystery of why the garden wall was built without a door - only to TRY to be forgotten.
B004T4LUPW|1.0|Had terrible time with sync of this app to my calendar... I was looking for a simple way to manage my life.... Greatly  disappointed!
B0036EH3UC|5.0|The perfect complete collection, including even the movie \\"Razor\\" for the ultimate fan. If you are thinking about getting into this show, and just want to rent it, go ahead and buy the whole serious, you will want to own this!
0811879542|5.0|I bought this book and few others together for my 2-year-old. This one became his favorite right away! I have to say the author is full of imagination.
B0058P7KUA|4.0|This game is great!  I just wish there was more then 5 levels.  Only took 30 mins to beat the whole game.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|Fun movie for the kids.  You'd think they would just keep re-doing the same story line / plots, but this one has enough of a twist / new story that it is a fun adventure.
0312641893|4.0|Cinder is a cyborg and a mechanic working in New Beijing. Kai the prince comes to her shop asking her to fix a robot that is special to him. Cinder is also wanting to run away from her step mother.<br /><br />There is some sort of plague that is killing off robots. Cinder doesn't really remember much of her life before an accident. Cinder also loses someone very dear to her, but unable to cry. I loved that Kai was slowly getting to know Cinder.<br /><br />I loved that she was doing such different work and getting dirty on the job.<br /><br />This was a very different telling of Cinderella. There were times she was a strong female but other times she wasn't. I loved the new world with the Lunars and such interesting side characters of Peony , and the Doctor.<br /><br />This was steam punk but science fiction mixed up. I loved this cover and overall I was impressed with story and can't wait to see what happens with Cinder. This is one series I want to continue reading more .
B004G6009U|5.0|Obviously my daughter loves this movie, but my boys also enjoy it, and my wife and I do too.  It has lots of action and is a fun adventure to watch over and over again as a family.

B002ZG97EC|4.0|This is a good movie.  A little bit of crude humor, and lots of minion laughing that is contagious--makes my kids start laughing which then makes me laugh!
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|I am really new to KID ROCK type of music but the more i listen to it - i found out what a great write and singer he really is - great song about every day life.
B00457WZEI|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I must say that it was by far one of the best books I have ever read. It's not too long but that does not take away from the depth presented in it. Highly recommended.
B002T9H2L0|5.0|This was a great war movie with typical tarantino humor.  The video quality on the blu-ray was also great.  A lot of unexpected plot twists.  I will have to put this on my annual watch list of war movies along with \\"The Dirty Dozen.\\"
B005K17RU0|4.0|Great app.  I like the fifteen day forcast as well as the hourly.  I also like the drop down on the daily forecasts and the weather alerts.  It's an overall helpful app.
097747609X|5.0|i like to go on cousin peter's amazon and look at cool things  my crazy grandpa has this book and he read it to me when i was a baby but i don't know french  one time I was asleep and I had a dream that I was doing the robot to conduct an orchestra in a movie theater and they were playing that song that plays in the football games that's like are you ready for some football  i don't like walder i was playing with ants a long time ago and i was building them a fort with lego pieces and then walder stomped em and broke their fort
1439102813|5.0|This is an amazing contemporary story about a little discussed, little understood disease. I found it very emotional and compelling.  In the beginning, I had a hard time liking Alice. She seemed rather cold and hard. She was very ruthless and critical in her appraisal of her children. Her constant harping at Lydia about college and her career was offputting. Her complete lack of understanding or respect for Lydia's decisions left me feeling very cold towards Alice. But as the story progressed, I grew to like and pity Alice.  One particularly striking moment in the story came when Alice compared Alzheimer's disease to cancer. She wished she could trade them because cancer is something she could fight. Her friends, family and strangers would rally behind her and support her in her fight against the disease. But with Alzheimer's, her friends and family pull away and become like strangers, embarassed and unsure how to be with her. It was such a sad and painful comparison, yet very true.  I listened to this on audiobook, narrated by the author. It was a very personal and emotional experience. The narration was done wonderfully, with all the emotional and passion you know the author has coming through in her telling of the story. I would definitely recommend this book, and the audiobook to readers.
B004GYY714|5.0|I love this app. It allows me to listen to radio from my native country, Hungary, my favorite music Jamaican and then cruise to Thailand for the remainder of the night.

B0063IH60K|5.0|I think that this game gives you a problem that's ready to be solved. it allows you to think and be smart about your actions.
B0063IH60K|5.0|works great never freezes. I like the  graphics and the fact that it is free doesn't hurt either. fun game
0307719774|4.0|I ordered this Q&A a Day Journal for myself a little before Christmas.  I started it with the first of the year so I haven't gotten too deeply into it yet, but I've glanced through it enough to know that I'm going to enjoy this little book.  I've always liked to write and have started multiple journals and diaries over the year, but tend to forget and stop after short spans of time.  So this journal is very convenient with its short questions.  It should be able to keep my attention for the 5 years.  I know with each year I'm going to enjoy looking back and seeing how I answered the questions the previous year and how my moods and opinions change.  With the limited space per day, it'll keep me from being long-winded.<br />I like the size of the book.  It's small enough to be portable, but not too tiny so that it's hard to write in.  However, it is a little difficult because the binding is hard and the book does not lay flight or stay open without being held.  Not a big deal in my opinion.  All told, I think this is going to be a neat way to get thoughts down in an organized manner and look back on my thoughts over the next five years.
B000V5W84U|4.0|This is not the best season ending episode we've seen from Star Trek.  But it is not a bad one, and somewhat important to (what would be) the DS9 story arc.  It's a classic Gene Roddenberry lesson of why there should be separation between church and state, only it's in the future on a remote space station.  This episode is very well acted, and I love that I hate Winn Adami within 5 minutes of her first appearance on the screen.  And there's explosions!  3.9/5 stars for some good TV.  ~Keep On Trekkin.
B000068OCS|1.0|The running time for this film is 1 hour 27 minutes. The beginning few minutes feature landscape time lapse and motion video as seen from aloft. After about 15 minutes of this, it moves on to show the human footprint, on the land, in buildings, in the factory. After another 15 minutes it migrates on to about 30 minutes of vehicle and people time-lapse traffic motion patterns. Then a few minutes of light play, similar to the the \\"time travel episode\\" in 2001 - A Space Odyssey. Ending with a crescendo of unflattering images of people, places, things, and more things. Meanwhile, the score tracks the visuals - meaning it is stunningly simple, boringly repetitive, and predictable. The final credits feature sayings from Hopi culture - which seem to imply the whole import of this film is to convince the viewer to \\"Aliquam vitae reditum basics\\" - maybe by moving to the nearest Hopi reservation.  On the other hand, it would be great as a You-Tube video lasting about five minutes.
B0063IH60K|4.0|great but could have different. levels to go through with increasing. intensity of difficulty but overall. easy to use can u put different variety of solitaire games
B005DOKM9M|5.0|I love this sleeve! It gives the perfect amount of protection without making the device too bulky, and u can charge the kindle while safely inside the sleeve. The smell isn't that bad and it goes away after a few days. My only complaint is that if u bent it or get a crease in it in any way the crease is permant.
B0036IGJ1C|4.0|I read this book and loved it. What a wonderful feel-good book to read.  I passed the book on to my sister and she loved it as well. Could not  stop thanking me for the book.It's about the power of the human spirit.   I highly recommend this Mitch Albom book.  Mary Lou Limbago  Idaho

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have had this app for over a year and through several updates. I read several reviews and some of them said it was malicious and would not shut off. I personally have not had this problem. It does not keep running on my android phone. Also, to the permissions and collecting personal info, I have not been spammed at all. I can tell you that I have seen a few Bible apps (some good and some not so much ) and this is by far the best. There are many, many different versions and in many languages. I can't think of anything they could add. The other reviews tell of the many features. The bottom line: It makes reading the Bible easier. I love it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This was the first app I downloaded and I use it the most. It's great for a game of solitaire...I don't really expect more of it than solitaire so this is a keeper!
0743270754|5.0|There is nothing I can add to the far more erudite reviews already written here.. Just finished this masterpiece & I was struck by how closely Obama has followed Lincoln's example....Making Hillary his Secretary of State for one thing. Obama is hated with the same intensity as Lincoln was. I recently heard some Southern politician say that if Lincoln had lived in the 20th century he would have been tried & hung at Nuremberg for crimes against humanity (referring to the 600,00 dead in the Civil War). Obama also had a very limited political career before running for the presidency. Obama seemed to rise out of almost no where against well established politicians of the day to become our president. They both overcame different but very formidable obstacles growing up.  Will Obama become another Lincoln? I don't think so but there are definite similarities.

B006LR0XLM|5.0|I've used Dropbox on my various computers for 2 years and smartphone (LG Ally) for about a year. Cannot get along without it now.<br /><br />In the past, I've also depended on Documents To Go for several years (starting on a Palm TX) with a computer. Added to my smartphone, their upgrades totally messed up my filing system, rendering (for example) carefully categorized recipes useless. Same for all my other files. Even the computer DTG files crashed. Only some photos and a contact list remain. And I paid the DTG cost for the software twice -- once for the computer and later for the mobile version. I do not recommend it for these reasons.<br /><br />Along came Dropbox. Now, for example, one folder, All Recipes, has hundreds of files in it, organized by over a dozen categories. You can have any number of folders and files, etc., until you use up the free 2 gigs (plus additional capacity when a friend signs up). They cannot be lost or corrupted in the cloud, and my smartphone is not loaded with all these files. Only when I call one up for use, then back into the cloud. For me, this is a miracle!<br /><br />And it's FREE!!! I love it and recommend it without reservation. Ten stars!
B006MHWXMS|3.0|I don't want a constantly running service on my phone. I do want nested sync of Google Tasks.<br /><br />Looks great and runs smoothly, on my tablet as well as my phone, but definitely not what I'm looking for.<br /><br />I'm not dropping the rating for not suiting my needs, I'm dropping it because of the nested tasks issue. Fix that and you have a four star app.<br /><br />You can use this without giving it access to your Google account, there's just no sync available without that connection, which isn't a problem if you're only using it on one device.<br /><br />To people complaining about security with their Google account: If you're concerned about it why haven't you set up application specific passwords so you can revoke access from your account settings and never give it your primary password?
B00526ZKYS|4.0|This was one of the better books I've read in a while. I really liked the controversy about whether or jot Lena thought that love was bad or not. The writing in this book is beautiful; the authorbmust have been burn to write. The kindle edition loses one star, though, besause the formatting was kind of crappy. Many times, it  started a new paragragh ot the middle of the sentence. That annoyed me. But if you want a beautiful story about a disturbing future world that seems quite possible to me, check out Delirium!

B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that you can choose the version you prefer. I also like that you can read along while you listen. that helps me retain a lot better. this app is great and I cant believe its free with all it offers
B006MHWXMS|5.0|practical and free ! Can it get any better ? highly suggested! worth the installment! dont hesitate to purchase !
B004GJDQT8|1.0|I actually have the app for the iPhone and it's just as bad. I prefer using the mobile site to the app. I can't search the app using a store's name and by viewing their entire store front. That's very disappointing since I like to purchase multiple items from the same seller and ONLY pay one shipping cost instead of four or five from different sellers.
B006AX6ONI|1.0|never read the blog and found the book pretty standard with not alot of 'new ideas' on how to be successful.. sounds like another guy who was just in the right place at the right time (i.e. software)
B004JK61K0|5.0|this app does what it should and is easy to understand.  best of all it is free. thanks k-9 dog walkers.<br />I don't know what happened, but the app didn't work one day.  The good thing is that I can get gmail on my Kindle fire HD.  All I have to do is go to the web like with any computer, and check my gmail.  Of course, I need wifi for the 7\\" Kindle HD.  Anyhow.

1455510319|3.0|I like most of Michael Connelly's work, in particular his Bosch tales, though Mickey Haller is also a gripping character oozing personality.  This story was great, until the ending, and like many of his endings seems too contrived and too quick, with a twist that kind of works but doesn't impress.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Bought this as a christmas gift for my son, he was very happy with it and so far have not heard any complaints about it.
B006MHWXMS|2.0|wanted this to work. failed to open several times and required force close. really want an app that syncs to my task list on Google.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I started this book and within the first few chapters I couldn't put it down. Yes its a little slow to get into but after you understand whats going on it's very hard to set the book down...
B004HX4RT6|5.0|Had to find a good chess app for my Kindle Fire. This app works great with no lag. Can't beat it for the price.
B006P4HFH6|1.0|I had high hopes for this series but it quickly degenerated into a ripoff of every horror movie ever made. Very little originality. What a way to end a season, finish killing off everybody that they spent a season getting you interested in.
B005KELS6Q|5.0|This is a very nice protective sleeve.  The Kindle Touch fits perfectly inside & the thick neoprene fabric provides plenty of protection for carrying in your purse, briefcase or in hand.  The grip is a nice soft rubber.  The color is a very bright scarlet pink; probably not for everyone's taste but its bright color makes it easy to find.  The zipper is sewn in neatly & it has two rubberized pull tabs<br /><br />The only negative on my sleeve:  the stitching is not perfectly sewn on the front grip.  It's not a big issue, but it does detract a bit from its good looks.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game. Really enjoyed playing. Would recommend to others. Used the numbers on the cards to aid in teaching a preschooler her numbers.
B006MHWXMS|2.0|Nice enough display but it wants an unreasonable amount of homepage. CalendarGoo task widget does it better cause it scrolls and you get a calendar.
B006QKKMBA|4.0|This movie was so preictable, just like the others. But, this was way more scarier, put together and   and just over all better than the rest.
B004EPZ0AM|4.0|Having seen Happy Feet 2, I can save you a lot of time in summing it up.  It's not a good children's film if you've got parent issues.  That does not make it a bad movie.<br /><br />A lot of folks here have trashed it because it opens up kids to the fact that the world is not a safe and wholesome place.  There are people in it who are too selfish, too afraid or too busy to care, even if the debts they owe others are enormous.  There are people in the world we esteem who are not always what we believe them to be.  These are not nice things for kids to learn.<br /><br />Hence the PG rating.  You will have to explain some of it to the kids.  If you don't like telling your kid about some of the world's realities, don't take them to this movie.<br /><br />That said, it has an excellent message: That when people put aside their differences, don't let others interfere and work together, they can move mountains.  In this case, literally.<br /><br />That is a good thing for kids to learn.<br /><br />The music is on par with the previous movie, with many memorable tracks.  The characters are pretty much the same, with the notable exception of the Krills, Will and Bill.  The message of their journey echoes that of the movie: That although one can be a catalyst for action, it takes the cooperation of many to act in a big way.<br /><br />If you're looking for mindless fluff your kids can giggle at, keep looking.  If you're looking for a good way to start talking to your kids about what the world is like, this may be a good entree into that conversation.  If you're unsure, watch it with an open mind and without your kids.  Then decide.<br /><br />I enjoyed it more than average.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I must say I'm not an avid reader and haven't read a book in about 10 years, but I couldn't put this one down!! I read non-stop until I was done. This book made me laugh, cry and cry some more. In so many ways I could relate and at times felt like I was one of the characters. I kept turning the last page hoping for a next but it was blank. Can't wait for the next book!! This Author really has a great talent!

0380799006|5.0|This book addresses everyday situations.  Interestingly enough it also gives insight into relationships with my own brothers and sisters (family of seven kids).  I still have not absorbed all the information provided since I keep stopping to think about situations that come up daily and which possible solution will work.  I'm 68 yrs old and have lived w/ my youngest son since his wife past away in 2007 leaving 2 daughters ages 4 & 5yrs old. This book is and will be helpful in years to come.  DON'T PASS IT UP

B000P0J0A6|5.0|Ordered this as a Christmas present for my niece.  It arrived on time and with no damages.  I would definitely order from this retailer again.
B005DOL0R0|5.0|Bought this at Christmas to go with my husband's new Kindle Fire - He loved it!  We have always been happy with our Amazon purchases.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I 've been using Palm PDA and PC Bible readers for years. This is one of the most feature-rich, easy to use and useful readers that I've used. I especially like the ability to quickly  switch between versions without losing my place in the text, and the high quality audio reader is great too. My congrats and thanks to the Lockman Foundation for producing and making this app available to all for free. I highly recommend it...
B003TJR2HS|5.0|Yea yea, it does what it's supposed to do and that's about it. HOWEVER, it'll take years of therapy to get over the price screwin I got! Just to be fair it gets the full five stars because I am the dummy who spent the money on this overpriced widget.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love that there are many versions and reading plans available.  This app made it possible for me to FINALLY complete an entire year's reading plan. I have it on all of my electronic devices. Good stuff! Thanks!
1451627289|4.0|I don't usually have the attention span to read such a long book. The last long one I managed was \\"East of Eden\\". I am always amazed when people say they read it in a couple of days, really?    Mr King did a ton of research and I really enjoyed going back in time.  It is well worth it and I am sad that I finished it.
B000Y7ZHCU|4.0|Having purchased this DVD a long time ago i have found the newer version excellent and would recommend to antone who enjoys Celine Dion to buy this version.
0446310786|5.0|I was born in 1976 and found out all of a sudden that some of the movies I like are movies that were viewed by my father who was born in 1945.  That is close to 30 years difference.  But I thought I would try classic movies and picked the good old classic To Kill A Mocking Bird for my first one and was more then overly satisfied with my choice.  Which is why teachers have students read the novel in school, Because it teaches you a good lesson for growing up.  And the classics were great for teaching you all about love, and all about life's rights and wrongs.  And To Kill A Mockingbird is a great movie to watch for all ages to learn, enjoy, and entertain.  I would recommend it to bye including all types of movies.
B005EZJ3MW|3.0|ITunes categorised this album under \\"children\\". Partially true judging from the three opening party tracks. However the second half of the album presents Lovato with a Kelly Clarkson with the pain of Amy Winehouse. With the powerful Skyscrapper and For The Love of A Daughter, we see a mature and sensitive Lovato. It is strange that Skyscrapper did not get any Grammy nomination.
B005J9ZDYK|5.0|A great show from GB.  Course you have to love \\"Claymation\\" and cartoon humor.  Arrived on time and as advertised.  I can recommend this unit to all buyers.
1583334386|5.0|The Willpower Instinct delivers immediate impact. Dr. McGonigal is an expert, award winning writer and teacher from Stanford, who combines a persuasive and entertaining understanding of science and research with proven and powerful daily strategies. The result is an entirely new perspective on willpower, why it fails and what are the best ways we can support ourselves and others in doing what's most important even when it's difficult.  I was so impressed and inspired by The Willpower Instinct I've given copies to friends and colleagues who are corporate and not for profit executives, medical and health care professionals, teachers, athletes, coaches, parents and teenagers.
B006MHWXMS|2.0|Picked this up as the free app.  Would not recommend paying for it.  There are better free to do lists such as Astrid.  There are few options to set. For example the date format is stuck at European (day/month/year)  and can't be set to North America format.  Also many settings can't be globally set to your preferences so need to change settings individually for each entry.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Absolutely wonderful game! Has never froze or lagged my Kindle Fire! Great for car rides, and you can change your card and background pictures!
B005N0PJJO|4.0|This book was my favorite.  It captured me in the scene where Ana returned home drinking from the bar across the street. Christian had been taking care of an ex-sub of his. The ending of the scene and Christian's freak out captivated me. That was my favorite scene in the entire trilogy. Right after Ana told Christian she couldn't do this anymore. He put himself in her hands. Christian had love, fear and control all jumbled up in his head. Still, it was emotionally intense.<br /><br />What I loved in this sequel is that I saw a growth in Christian and Ana, both individually and as a couple. Even though Christian is still lording over Ana, he begins to open up little by little. Ana gets him to peel off a layer every once in a while, making Christian more vulnerable and open to her. She was able to touch a part of him that even Ms. Pedo couldn't reach.<br /><br />This is the book where I felt the poop hits the fan.  Many emotional outbursts and loss of control by primary and secondary characters made for an exciting read. Of everyone, Christian's struggle with his loss of control was fascinating to observe.  Some of his loss of control was voluntary, but still it was complicated.  The author did a good job of engaging the reader with the journey between Christian and Ana as they tried to build a life together.<br /><br />In this sequel, I liked Christian more than I did in Book 1. He let his guard down more and was more spontaneous. Not a lot, just a little more than he did in book 1.  He was a little less predatory, but still manipulative.  A lot of heroes have bad childhoods so that didn't give him a pass to invade people's privacy. Ana was so young and inexperienced, and Christian was taking advantage of that.  Ana was a clean slate for Christian, like a baby he could mold and control. He could teach and train her like he wanted. That is essentially what he did. He insinuated himself into every facet of her life. I thought Christian was bullying Ana, even if she didn't realize it. She can't go anywhere without his approval. She can't wear Jose's jacket without him frothing at the mouth. She can't get a drink with Kate unless Christian was okay with it. There so many times Ana was scared that Christian would be mad at her. Because when Christian was mad, he wanted to punish her. It just made me shake my head. Ana is his girlfriend and lover, not his 5 year old daughter. But he kept saying you \\"defied\\" me,  and he was genuinely baffled that she didn't do everything he said when and how he said do it.  On the occasions that Ana was able to insist upon what she wanted, I was proud of her effort.<br /><br />Unlike other readers, I do like Ana. She is young and green. She is just learning her way in the world. She isn't as worldly as Kate or Mia. She was showing signs of asserting herself. I would love it if the author gave Ana more of a voice in the next installments. We often know what Christian wants or dreams of, but what music does Ana like? Christian is passionate about world hunger but what are Ana's passions? I want to see more of Ana's independent goals.  But based on the growth in this book, I am confident Ana will grow even more in the third and final installation of this series.<br /><br />Like I said, this book was riveting. While the BDSM stuff was a tad uncomfortable for me, the emotional intensity was endearing.o anywhere without his approval. She can't wear Jose's jacket without him frothing at the mouth.

B001S86J2Q|5.0|I had been looking for a grease Blu-Ray for my wife. I had been looking all day for a good price. Well I'm glad I'd stopped here. Good price and blazing fast shipping. My wife was happy for Christmas. That was good. Thanks!!!
1455830518|1.0|The retelling of each point was so constant that it made the book a total task and took any of the magic out of it.  There was a story in there... maybe- BUT each action, reaction or description was rewritten so many times that it became almost a joke.  I listened to it in my car and the felt so sorry for the poor actors who had to repeat themselves a zillion and one times.  I am so sorry paid for this I found it to be a pedantic mess.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love that this case not only is beautiful, but makes your Kindle look like a book.  Very pleased with this product and the securing straps are very strong and tight so you don't have to worry.
B004LK5CEE|5.0|Words cannot describe how amazing I felt after I watched \\"Almost Famous\\" for the first time, which funnily enough was yesterday. The movie is a terrific film, and I am talking about the Director's Cut. Yes, it is the only version I have saw, and actually, I have no intention on seeing the theatrical release at all, the Director's Cut is amazing. I just felt so GOOD after watching this movie, it made me feel so happy and just glad to be alive. I immediately connected with the character of William and related to him very easily. Throughout the film we take this journey with him, and Cameron Crowe presents the film in such a way that it feels as if we are taking the journey with him. There were times when I laughed out loud, and cried. But in the end I just felt so good, and I was completely full of joy and warmth from this movie. Everyone should see this, especially teenagers between 13-15. Who cares if it's Rated R, it'll get them ready for life! And that's what this movie is really about, life, and the lessons and journeys you take through and with you. A very, very good film. A Great Film!
1451648537|5.0|I comparison shop so i checked Barnes & Nobles store, Target, Wal-Mart, and other stores. Amazon had the best value for this book. Most importantly my BF loved it he finished it the first week he got it. He said you really get an inside look about Steve Jobs' personal life and his thoughts about Apple. Money well spent!
B005I6EU48|4.0|This is a great kindle fire cover. I bought this for my son's kindle and he has been thrilled with it and has had many compliments on it. It's very nice material and he likes the pocket on the inside of the cover. It was a little pricey, but this is the one he wanted and I feel it was worth it because of how durable it seems to be and how nice it looks.  Only gave it 4 stars due to price!
B0063IH60K|5.0|this app makes it a pleasure to occupy time playing solitaire. It is simple and intuitive, allowing one to enjoy the game
B005QBKXSC|4.0|A nice followup by Daughtery! Maybe not quite the cutting edge his other efforts have had, and hence only four stars rather than five. Makes me look forward to his future releases even more though. Every new artist deserves one lackluster release!
B003L77GGK|5.0|Received the DVD's in great condition and on time for my son's Christmas present.  He loved the sixth season, and can not wait for season seven.
B006MHWXMS|1.0|Tasks N Todos Pro Looks nice with a colorful widget.  That's nice but I wouldn't trust the program's accuracy.<br /><br />Selecting the date from the edit menu displays the calendar for which January 2012 is shown with 32 days.<br /><br />Scrolling to February 2012, the last few days of January still showing, January shows 31 days, but 2012 is a leap year and February should show 29 days - only shows 28 days.<br /><br />Also from the edit menu the date format is only shown in DD MM YYYY format with no option to change.  It doesn't even look at the system default format.<br /><br />Very basic functions for calendar routine and Tasks N Todo Pro certainly fails them.  So far that's all I have but that's enough for me to go back to my previous tasks application which is accurate, reliable and gives me a lot more control of its features.
B001AIRUPE|5.0|I bought this as a gift for my brother since he is a big Nightmare Before Christmas fan. It looked really cool when he was opening it and everyone was impressed. It definitely is an item for a true collector to have.
B0034KZE9U|5.0|I got these for my mom for Christmas. She's a head chef at a local restaurant and comes home begging my younger sister for a foot rub every day. But since I've gotten her these shoes, all she can do is rave about how her feet don't hurt, her hips don't hurt, and by the time she gets home she doesn't feel like taking a nap, and she'll actually cook us dinner now. She loves them and won't let me wear them for fear of wearing them down. She wears 8W and they fit her perfectly.
B006C1DH92|3.0|Fruit ninja with a twist.  I enjoy the bandito mode, but there isn't a lot new here.  Also, I keep seeing notifications of the achievements I've won but can't find a list of achievements anywhere in the menus.
B001XITTHI|3.0|ordered the pop-up book as a surprise for my daughter's Christmas. Didn't open the package when it came in but rather wrapped it. She opened it on Christmas morning to find the original hardcover book had been shipped instead of the pop-up book. I'm sure she'll like the book when I sent the other back and get the right one.
B005OLF6BI|5.0|My Daughter, just like any young women would have been happy to receive this Cd. Product was shipped quickly and packaged very well.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I used this DVD for roughly 10 days back in August 2011, and I did see a difference in my weight. I do not use a scale as I believe them to be inaccurate most of the time, so I dont know how much weight was lost.<br />I currently wear a size 16 but when I used the DVD I had been able to get into my size 14 jeans.<br /><br />I started this workout again yesterday and it does make you sore, my arms hurt the worst from the push-ups.<br /><br />I am 5'3, after I had my son I couldnt keep the weight off and suffered post-partom depression, breast feeding can also cause you to want to eat all the time!  Anyways, I want to lose about 30lbs.<br /><br />I believe that since this is a 30 day work out and 3 levels to do each level for 10 days. I went ahead with the 2nd level on the 7th day though.<br /><br />I was in the military in 07 and I think this DVD makes me hurt worse then the drill sergeant ever did XD<br /><br />It works, if you do it right and dont cheat yourself. Eat healthy, no fast foods or sodas and not a lot of carbs, whole grain pastas are best or rice. Lot of protein and water. And make sure to eat less then 2000 cals.
0545265355|5.0|I've never seen such a well-crafted piece of work before... But Suzane Collin's action-packed series The Hunger Games did it!!! She passed the mark!!!
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|I just purchased this CD on both iTunes and then a hard copy on Amazon to show my support for her courage in standing up to the establishment.  I loved her first few CDs but didn't realize she had a new album out until I read about the Ron Paul endorsement... this is the first time I've ever bought two copies of an album, and the more I read about any supposed \\"backlash\\" against Kelly Clarkson for speaking her mind, the more I'll consider buying a third, or fourth.  Go Kelly!!!!!!  You truly are an American Idol! :D
B001CTDH76|5.0|I use the word \\"psuedo\\" because it appears that the usual procedures are rarely adhered to in this show, but that is its greatest appeal. I came across this show watching reruns on TNT and fell in love with it. What a cast of characters. The stories are fairly typical murders but the way Patrick and his cohorts go about solving the cases are very entertaining. The entire cast is superb with Simon Baker as Jane, Robin Tunney as the leader, and Amanda Righetti,Tim Kang and Owain Yeoman rounding out the cast. They all bring their characters to life with wit and charm. There is just enough of sexual tension between Agent Lisbon (Tunney) and Patrick (Baker)to keep everyone guessing what will happen between them and their repartee is quite amusing.<br /><br />This show is not meant to be taken seriously. Although there are some serious episodes and the history of Patrick Jane is sad, the episodes are mostly played for the understated and subdued humor. The only actor here that I have seen before is Robin Tunney who has made many movies and a very fine actress. But the other supporting players bring a fresh dynamic to the show. Without giving away anything the basic premise is that the team is after a very bad serial killer called Red John. This story thread is touched however slightly in nearly every episode.<br /><br />I like this show enough to purchase all three seasons that are currently available. I look forward to Season 4 on DVD. Highly recommended.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I like it it's not perfect but pretty good for a free app. It would be cool if you could switch out tile sets.
B004XDYJRU|3.0|How do you start a recording? The app says to click on the recording icon but that icon doesn't appear on the screen while the radio is playing.
B004LWZW4W|2.0|Saw this movie, On Demand (free with coupon, thank goodness). I really wanted to like it, and the previews looked like it was well made.  The actual movie however was very disappointing.  The visual effects were stunning. The acting was sub par at best.  The casting was not very good. John Lithgow was a good choice, but Franco was no good in the lead role.  The love interest was never developed, so you never cared about them. Getting to the story of the apes, it was just not reasonable to believe what was being told on screen. You're given no bridge as to how the serum made the primates able to know things they were never taught. It is like the serum made them omniscient, not just smart. I also found it insulting when the enraged, protective Caesar attacks and severely wounds a person, that it was not put down. Come on! Really?! In real life there is no way an animal that was stolen from a research lab and attacked a person would take another breath. They should have come up with a different mechanism in the story.  Just plain bad writing.  I hate to say it, I actually enjoyed the Mark Wahlberg version better.

1849025940|5.0|There were quarrels at the Rue Coq d'Or.  It was a narrow street, a ravine.  Hotels were packed with foreign lodgers, (guest workers?).  There were tiny bistros.  It was a 'representat6ive Paris slum'.  The author lived in the Coq d'Or quarter for a year and a half.  The author's experience of poverty was that he became the victim of fate.  His life became squalid and boring.  He claims there is a peculiar lowness to poverty.  Inertia is the writer's memory of hunger.    Orwell and a Russian friend joined forces in a job search.  The friend was supposed to be a maitre d'hotel and Orwell a plongeur at a new restaurant.  In the meantime a job had to be found to tide the men over until the restaurant opened for business.  Jobs were found at a fairly well-run establishment.  Employees pilfered from the hotels.  Hotel work comes in rushes.  When things are busy there is a great amount of noise and disorder.  Waiters are not socialists, they are snobs.  Plongeurs are drudges.  Dirtiness is inherent in the hotels and restaurants.  The staff's food, though,  was prepared cleanly.    As a plongeur Orwell had no sensation of poverty.  He and his friend Boris resigned from their jobs to move over to work at the new restaurant.  They found themselves with other prospective workers being used to put the building into shape for its proposed use.  Setting up the new eating establishment amounts to a sparkling essay by Orwell on how things work, i.e. how to evade creditors, how to substitute cheap- materials for more expensive materials.  The Auberge de Jehan Cottard was a bad restaurant.  It was started on insufficient capital.  Orwell believed a plongeur was a slave and a wasted slave.    Orwell returned to England, a good country when you are not poor.  He exchanged his own clothes for poor clothes and noticed how everyone's demeanor changed.  Tramps received charity.  A tramp's character is abject and envious.  Orwell met a man who seemed to prove the efficacy of education, Bozo.  Match-selling is a ploy to get around the3 law prohibiting begging.  The book records London slang.  Orwell visited a workhouse and received a large meal.  Tramps are condemned to suffer malnutition, celibacy, and idleness.    Orwell was a first-rate social thinker.  Sadly his description of work at the lower depths and the lack of work is all too modern.
B00632HWOG|3.0|I liked it better than the standard email app it has pre-installled but when u received an email it would keep and if u turn the volume all the way down it still beeps and it can get really anoying. And if I am doing something like in a meeting and it goes off....
B0052VUNHC|2.0|The premise for the story was interesting as far as romances with no major conflict but your own baggage goes.  Very real life but tricky to keep the reader interested.  Author did not quite succeed for me.  This felt very much like a YA that never quite goes deep enough but does go into non-YA territory with the detailed love scenes.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This game is okay.  I do not reccomend this game because it is too easy.  I beat the game in 2 hours.
B004EPYZP8|5.0|I loved this movie. There were many suprising twists to it. Matthew is wonderful in this movie. He is a great actor and I wish he were onscreen more often.
B004EPYZSU|4.0|When I first saw the trailer for this film I was very skeptical.<br />I enjoy Harrison Ford and Daniel Craig, and who doesn't like a good western... but ALIENS??<br />It just seemed like too much or a bad mix of 2 over played genre's...<br />Yet when I watched this film for the first time there were multiple emotions that came over me.<br />First I felt like I was watching a great western like Tombstone.  The story, the characters, scenes etc... all made me feel like i was in the old west taking part of the film.<br />Then when the alien's were slowly brought into the mix I felt like I was seeing an epic such as Star Trek for the first time!<br /><br />The 2 so easily meshed together in a way that only a great director and producer could engineer...<br /><br />this is a MUST see for any history or Sci-Fi fanatic!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|entertaining yet somewhat juvenile. very short and quick games.  great for a no brainer time killer. overall it really not that bad.
B006MHWXMS|5.0|Finally! its been a while since Amazon gave away something actually useful / practical.<br /><br />So far this is turning out to be one of the better To-Do apps I've tried. The layout is very neat and clean, and most of the functions are pretty intuitive so the learning curve is pretty minimal. The widget is nice as well, but I would like a transparency option so it blend sin with the rest of my widgets (minor detail thats not worth docking a star for). So far its running great, very responsive and stable, on my Moto Defy.

Favorite is \\"Blackbird.\\" CD's only missing \\"All my Loving.\\" But you can't complain, this Good Evening New york city CD is superb.
B004GYY714|5.0|Was sceptical about all the high praise for TuneIn Radio. Well rest assured, it is the best app out there and it's FREE! Hundreds of channels from music to politics, comedy to sports. The list seems ENDLESS! Love classic radio from the 30's and 40's, they have a channel that plays just that! Listening to all the classic comedy shows even as I right this, my first review! Download this app, you won't be disappointed!
B0026NWBY2|5.0|This is a great CD, bought new mint condition, no scratches. Plays great, love the cover art. Harrison is a seriously underated Beatle. His talent shows in this CD.
1451627289|5.0|I've come to really appreciate Stephen King's story-telling skills late but better late than never. This book was hard to put down. I'd recommend it to ANYONE!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I heard it was a great book but not appropriate for kids in elementary school. Hope you enjoy THIS FANTASTIC LITERATURE EXPERIENCE!
B003UESJF6|4.0|Will Farrell's movies are generally not family-friendly, but Elf and this one are VERY FUNNY and SAFE for the entire family.  Voice talents are great throughout (Ferrell is superb), plot is unique, as are the characters.  We laugh all the way through this one even after seeing it 4 times.  My kids (16 and 13) quote it often.
B006FE3FFC|4.0|I agree with the other reviewers.  The first 5 episodes of season 2 were a big letdown after an awesome season 1.  The finding Sophia story line dragged on FAR too long (or am I the only one who figured out she was in the barn around episode 4?)  However, season 2 finally got going for real in episode 7.  Hopefully the writers are finally off their sleep meds and the second half of season 2 will live up to season 1.  Recommendations to the writers:  1) Turn Lori Grimes (Sarah Callies) into a walker.  Please.  We'd finally be done with her incessant whining and angst.  She wasn't terribly likable on Prison Break and she's downright awful here.  Get Rick a new love interest (and Carl a new mommy.)  2) Bring back Morgan and Duane. Lots of potential story lines for Duane and Carl. 3) Expand the story line for Glenn (Steve Yuen) and Maggie (Lauren Cohan).  Theirs is the only truly interesting relationship in the series at this point.  4)Matches that should be made:  Andrea and Daryl (or Andrea and Dale?).  Also, Carol and Dale (or Carol and Daryl?). Either way, this show is strongest when it's emphasizing character developments and relationships.  5)Get them off the farm and back on the road.  Soon.  And figure out a way to take Hershel and Maggie with them.
B0063IH60K|5.0|pretty classic solitaire as you would expect. winning mode is a bit easier than regular mode because u can expect a.win
B0043RSE2M|5.0|Many reviews are already written about the film - we also loved it. This is about the 3D blu-ray disc. The 3D depth effects are present in every scene making the movie nice and enjoyable. There are several small OOS effects in the movie, and much more impressive OOS effects during the end credits. Overall an A+
B0063IH60K|4.0|Originally bought for my Samsung Transform since it wasn't powerful enough to handle most games, enjoyed it so much that I downloaded it again when I got my Kindle Fire.  Nice, but simple graphics, smooth gameplay.
B005IGDW24|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS GEARED MORE TOWARDS THE YOUNGER CROWD. THE 3D IS EXCELLENT THOUGH. IF YOU CAN GET THIS FOR $20 OR LESS, BUY IT, OTHERWISE I WOULD WAIT. IF YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY CRAZY ABOUT THE SMURFS, BUY IT.
B006OT03BM|1.0|They hyped this over at the Michael Bay forums and yet there is nothing in here you cannot get separately or already with the exception of Bay's signature.  What a complete farce and let down.  No commentary for Dark Side of the Moon is pathetic.  No extra new features from the first two blu-ray released films.  If you want Bay's signature, you can get it for $20.  As a Transformers fan, I am completely let down.  Limited to 5000 copies and has been on sale for over a week and still many available.  That tells you something, doesn't it?
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|THE MOVIE IS VERY WELL DONE. THE 3D IS EXCELLENT. IF YOU HAVEN'T BAUGHT THIS MOVIE YET, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I wish I could store bookmarks when offline on my Kindle Fire. That is not enough to knock off from 5 stars. This is a very useful app.
B002ZG98UK|5.0|THIS MOVIE IS VERY ENTERTAINING. NOT GORY, JUST FUN TO WATCH. THE 3D IS EXCELLENT. IS WOULDN'T SPEND OVER $25 THOUGH. IT'S UP TO YOU. YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED WITH THE 3D THOUGH.
0060873027|2.0|I have enjoyed many of Crichton's books in the past, taking a concept of future science and making it an enjoyable read.  While this book keeps one's interest, there are many \\"What?\\" and \\"Why?\\" moments to make the casual reader skip this entirely and not offer much to even the hard core Crichton readers.  Sorry to say, this one should not have been released under the Crichton name.
B0043RSE2M|5.0|THE 3D IS EXCELLENT. THE MOVIE IS FUN TO WATCH. IT'S THE $32 PRICE TAG THAT GIVES ME PAUSE. I WOULD WAIT AND BUY THIS ONE FOR UNDER $30. IT'S UP TO YOU.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I enjoy this game on my kindle fire. I even win on occassion. easy to download and play. I love it.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I was very excited to get this app it was the first one I downloaded on my fire but it constantly restarts itself and ran down my battery...deleted!
0061438294|4.0|I havent read a book like this before and its interesting. most of the body language descrived is common sense, but I sometimes forget to see it like it is. I recomend it to those who want to catch someone in a lie, or dont like to be fooled by a salesman, or anyone. especially for policeman, security guards, & attorneys.
084428596X|5.0|This book helped when trying to understand the Norwegain language. For those who do not have someone to teach them, this is the closest you will get to help understand on your own. It was very helpful for me!
0802473156|5.0|I learned about this book because of a radio station I listen to, they were making the 5love languages test. And it was really intresting. I bought it, I read it, and I loved it so much, I bought the spanish version to give it as a gift.
076115678X|5.0|I bought this book for myself after wanting it for a long time. I LEGIT, can't put the book down! It is SO infomative and educational, I am amazed. Thank you Amazon for the GREAT price on a FABULOUS book! :)
B005T87QCI|5.0|this app is one of the best apps I have. The graphics are pretty good for an app at that price.
B005OZE9SA|4.0|I originally bought the Sapphire 6 USB to replace my Creative Soundblaster X-fi (which I was using for the line-input on my laptop). But as I was using this 90% of the time as an interface to record/broadcast stereo signal from my DJ gear (CDJ1000 Mk3's, DJM800 with Traktor)to my DAW, I decided to order the Scarlett 2i2. I also lightly use Ableton live 8, and Komplete 6 for production. I must also add that the physical appearance is a lot better than the sapphire product line, in my opinion.    The physical product is gorgeous, simple, minimalistic, and easy to use. However the included drivers are QUITE FAR from functional. I experienced a MASSIVE amount of latency issues (clicks/pops/audio playing problems, BSOD etc.). Similar to the previous review, the easy temporary fix for this was to adjust the latency on the devices 'control panel'. I did notice though, that I had most issues while playing video. Please read below for additional information regarding drivers/system setup.    I'm using a non-dedicated DAW WinXP machine.    Reading online, I've read that there are people that are so anal about their DAW computer that it never touches the internet. All updates/programs/etc. are downloaded and brought in via CD/jump drive. That's too extreme for me though.     I found some tips on Focusrite's website [...] regarding setting an XP system up for audio playback, and was surprised to find that mine was NOT setup properly. There are similar articles regarding Vista, 7, and Mac too.    Also through some brief research, I found some hidden updated drivers! See beta.focusrite.com for the most updated beta drivers for this device! Being that Focusrite is continuing to release these updates has given me hope that this product is a work in process, and will only get better as time goes on.    Now with the product working consistently, it is a pretty major upgrade to my home studio. I now realize how colored the sound was from the creative soundblaster, and latency out of my DAW software is drastically minimized, to the point where I might actually be able to use it!    The only other issue I've been having, is that the \\"line\\" input is too sensitive. Using XLR out of my mixer, levels barely up, it easily redlines the inputs and distorts the signal. The rec out on the mixer works (with RCA to XLR adapters), but the gains on the 2i2 have to be set to 0. I know, reduce output from my mixer (levels are 'responsibly' low). But, in my opinion '0' should be off. I don't like that there is no way to adjust this. I can't even adjust levels in the PC's control panel, in fact the only gain/volume control is on the unit itself. Not sure why that is.    I hope you've found this review helpful. If I find any more good information on this device, I will be sure to share!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|If you believe in God, BUY THIS BOOK.I love it!!!!!!!! But you need a WI-FI to read it. But still its good
B005J29HCQ|5.0|I dont even really know where to start or really how to base this reivew of this monumental & somewhat contentious release. Monumental in that Brian Wilson was truly breaking new musical ground on SMiLE. The Mothers of Invention wished they were this innovative. Conentious? You bet. There was much in fighting at this time or how they say \\"creative differences\\" between the young genius (Brian) and the \\"mouth peice\\" on most hits Mike Love. Brian was following his muse to the highest & uncompromising peaks possible. Mike Love didnt really care for the other outside creative element in Van Dyke Parks. He really didnt get or like Parks odd ball style of word play. The other more pragmatic qualm was Love knew very little of SMiLE could actually be done on stage & he was the guy slogging it out on tours & he had to answer to the fans. (I do see his point.) However, all that is water under the bridge & Capital has done a fairly impressive job in assembling a good version of this LP. Admittedly, engineer Mark Linette (spelling?)did use Brian Wilson \\"Presents Smile\\" as the template for the track sequencing on this release which is not a bad thing but still doesn't really answer the true end result of Smile if Brian had not decided to scuttle the project in 1967. What do I like about this over the 2004 version with the capable Wondermints vs the \\"wrecking crew\\"?...We'll 1st, this one has the damn wrecking crew who were just an unbeleivable team & with Brian at the helm were even more impressive. 2nd & perhaps most striking is the Beach Boys harmonies just rip your heart out. Brian can still sing these days but only has a fraction of his '67 range. 3rd - I prefer the mono mix but some of the stereo mixes are impressive too. 4- this LP as a \\"concept\\" album just trounces Sgt Pepper & other concepts around the same time (in my opinion) in the over all concept itself (charting the course of americana in contrast to one's own existance...see Mr Parks for more on that), the harmonies, arrangements & the painstaking editing of the \\"modular\\" style recording Brian was into. 5- It's clear that this stuff is & was so \\"out there\\" that it probably wouldnt have sold the numbers Pepper did but I would still maintain it's one of the best albums you never heard. 6- There is more of a natural or analog richness to the sound of this lp verses the digital/pro tools feel of the 04 Smile. The music of SMiLE is sublime & haunting. It's also arguably not really a Beach Boy record (like Today) but more a \\"Brian\\" project. Essential is an understatement. The Bonus disc is ok too but not that essential as the proper LP.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This game is AWESOME!!!!!!!! You have to get this game, NOW!!!!!! Even better get Angry Birds(Add-Free) I said buy it now
1439102813|4.0|I think everyone should read this book. I have never been around anyone with Alzheimer's but would like to sit with one and treat them the way Alice informed us to. Thank you!
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is amazing in every way. It is the best game for all ages, you need to get it know.
B003O86FMW|5.0|One of the things I love about this book is even if I just *know* a certain something is going to happen, I still react in the appropriate manner because it's so good. I care about these characters, and from the first person perspective- I feel like I'm a fly on the wall. I caught myself clenching my jaw occasionally in anticipation for certain things to unfurl. Sometimes you want to scream at Katniss, who is so distrusting of people. You still care a great deal about her, though. The ending of this book will have you immediately scrambling for the next installment! I think I woke up my neighbors after I groaned at the last two sentences. This is perhaps the best book series I've read in a very long time! This will be one the gems on your bookshelf, and I dare you to not catch yourself thinking about it when you put the book down out of necessity.
140053271X|5.0|I haven't tried it too much yet but what I have seen working with it everything is ok. It has a very good price. I wouldn't think about another one having this nook here. Good buy
B0052VUNHC|5.0|As an adult, I've been exposed to so many dysfunctional relationships, but never have I read about one that was so broken and heart warming at the same time. I know, I know, it doesn't make sense. But, it's so true. In all of the drama, heartbreak, and pain, Beautiful Disaster is this remarkable story that everyone should read! Above everything else, it's a love story (by far the best love story I've ever read), but it's also a story about growing up and getting over the things we don't like about ourselves or our pasts. It will make the reader reflect, a lot. Cry, a lot. And best of all it will make the reader smile, a lot.<br /><br />Beautiful Disaster is my favorite contemporary romance, ever. Forget Sarah Dessen (I still love her but..) forget Jennifer Echols, and any other author I thought was my favorite, Jamie has knocked them all off the top of the list. I only thought  they were the best because I hadn't read anything by Jamie. Jamie McGuire writes a true love story that isn't all rainbows and kisses. It's so very real and so very, well, disastrous.<br /><br />Travis is at the top of my list of fictional best friends, and fictional boyfriends. His funny lines and true pain make him a relatable and an amazing leading man. Abby is his perfect counterpart, she keeps him straight and in line. Together they have a rough road ahead of them, but I think they'll make it through.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book is when Abby meets Travis' family. It's hilarious and emotional all in one.<br /><br />I caught myself rereading pages before going on, to make the book last longer. I will reread it within the next few weeks (bet that). Jamie is an amazing story teller. I just bought her book Providence and can't wait to get started on it.<br /><br />Little Tiny Spoiler Alert: A great thing about this book is it doesn't scream sequel, there's no painful cliffhanger, it has a nice resolution. Would I love to read more? Heck yes! But, if it stops here and doesn't keep going it won't hold me to the edge of my chair needing a conclusion.eding a conclusion.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I'm enjoying the layout for my Google Reader feeds and some of the preset feeds in feedly. Makes it more entertaining.
0439023521|5.0|I've heard many great things about this book, and I found them all true.  I loved the main character, the love story, the crazy set up and the amazing suspense.  I was glued to my seat the whole time I read this.  It's different from everything else out there, and the characters felt like living, breathing people.  I can't wait to see it as a movie!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it is the coolest game ever. it works grate on my kindle. I love it. it is worth downloading. the only thing bad about it is that my parent wont stop playing it so I can
0439023491|5.0|I wasn't sure if the author would be able to follow up the Hunger Games with a book that was just as wonderful as the first--but she did!  I love the way we learn more about the crazy society in this book, and that we get more of Katniss and Peeta.  (I also enjoy saying \\"Peeta\\" which sounds like someone with a speech impeniment saying \\"Peter\\")  Anyway, great book--loved every page!
B004FOA84A|3.0|need more levels for this game other that it was really fun. the graphics were cool the kids really liked it
B0059XTUMC|5.0|Well, YOU might think movies do. But at least look at the trailer to try and get some glimpse of how this movie gets across a whole range of emotions with music and printed dialog screens...just like the olden days! The acting is terrific all around, with especial chemistry between the two leads. And a dog that should get a special Oscar like they invented for Shirley Temple. No spoilers here but I'll say there are some unexpected surprises. Give this a shot and you'll be rewarded by seeing something very rare and special.
B005S7GT32|5.0|I have been mesmerized by this album, listening with good quality earbuds.  The orchestral arrangements are masterful and Gabriel's voice is better than ever.  These are some of my favorite songs (and some I'm not as familiar with) but I welcome these new arrangements with open ears. I have no problem with the female vocalists as others have stated.  Standouts for me are the intense Red Rain, San Jacinto & Rhythm of the Heat, and the bouncy Solsbury Hill. The songs on 'So' (one of my all time favorite albums) were so perfect that for me, of the four on here, only Red Rain come close to transcending the original.  Still, after listening to the originals a billion times over the years, the alternate versions are most refreshing. And what a deal, 80 minutes of such top-calibre music for $5.  Thanks, Amazon mp3!
0811877485|5.0|I almost didnt order after reading reviews, but took a chance on them these decals were for my sons room and are very cute and had no trouble with them sticking to the wall, also very easy to pull off and put somewhere else if need to.
B005J4TLN4|5.0|I have seen this movie six times and I'm not tired of it. It's funny, it's scary, it's surprising, and it's FUN. I saw it in the movies for free, I saw it again when it came out, and now I own it on DVD. I have watched it over and over. I make my friends come over, sit them in front of the TV, and make them watch it with me because it's that much fun to watch somebody fall in love with a movie like you know they will.  Since I love \\"Shaun of the Dead,\\" too, I loved seeing Nick Frost in this (he was Ed in \\"Shaun\\") and he's just hot, obviously.  See this movie. Don't read TOO many reviews. You won't regret it.
1405005181|5.0|I and my kids love this book. I usually have to order a couple new copies every year. It is especially fun for story time as there is alot you can do with the prose, I also use it to teach sequencing and rhyming with my preschoolers. FUN FUN FUN
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|Pros:<br />I just like it.  It's more straightforward than Springpad.<br /><br />Cons:<br />Barcode scanning. In Springpad I can scan a barcode, and it will get info from the web and save it in text format.<br /><br />With Evernote there is no such feature. I can exit Evernote, use a barcode scanning app, find the barcode info in the Life V2 Browser, and import a picture (an image file, not text) of the web page or part of that page.  It's a big data hog AND it's not text which means it's a pita to work with.  Not only that, but if I want to use Evernote's text recognition software I have to send a data-hoggong image over the network.  Data plans cost too much, thanks but no thanks.<br /><br />Related note: I do like the Life V2 Browser.  I only tried it because of its Evernote capabilities, but I am pleased with the browser overall.

B000ICM0YY|4.0|Je ne suis pas une spécialiste, néanmoins, voici mon opinion: technique époustouflante, mais une interprêtation peut-être un peu trop retenue, ne verse pas dans le lyrisme.
0307959856|1.0|I was so looking forward to settling down with this read. What a disappointment. The plotting storyline and contrived explanation of the murder was totally unbelievable. The Wickham/Mrs.Younge  connection and her death was laughable. Bringing \\"Emma\\" into to mix was just gratuitous pap.  Don't waste your time.  This sequel is just farce.
B0038P59A0|3.0|This is the first time I've ever started writing a review before the movie was over...<br /><br />It was all cleverly done but the question pounding the cells of my haunted mind is this: Is a watching of this really worthy any length of my time... and does it amount to any food for thought?<br /><br />However, I have decided to let it play to it's very end; one truly never knows before one knows it all :)
B006MHWXMS|1.0|only works once on Samsung epic force closes every attempt even after reinstalling this  is exactly what I'd been looking for. too bad it's worthless
0312641893|5.0|Despite this being a fairytale retelling, Marissa Meyer succeeded in making Cinder a refreshing read. There were some familiar elements included throughout, such as the ball, but Meyer kept her story moving forward with sci-fi technology, a plague-ridden New Beijing (and world), an evil Lunar queen, and some political intrigue. I was hooked from the first page and this is a series I will eagerly look forward to with each installment.<br /><br />We're all familiar with the original fairytale so it should be to no one's surprise that our main character, Cinder, lives and works under the control of her stepmother. The difference here, however, is that Cinder is a cyborg, which only adds to the many reasons Adri dislikes her. Instead of being super depressed and mopey, though, Cinder is very much an individual with her own hopes and aspirations. Even as things fall apart around her -- and they really do -- she keeps herself collected and motivated. I can easily appreciate the kickass ways from other YA heroines, but what I loved about Cinder is that her fierceness was a lot more subtle.<br /><br />The side characters were great, too, and elicited strong reactions from me. Iko, Cinder's android friend, was hilarious and I loved each of her scenes. Cinder's relationship with Peony, her younger stepsister, was one that definitely tugged at my heart strings. Adri, the stepmother, was a character I disliked for mistreating Cinder, but her reasons felt very real to me. In a weird, twisted way, I could maybe understand where she was coming from. As for the Lunar queen, Levana...YIKES. Creepy, creepy and I can't wait to uncover more details about her and the Lunar people.<br /><br />Then, of course, there's the love interest in the form of one Prince Kai. The book is light on the kissing and other romance-ish stuff, but that didn't stop me from growing attached to the scenes between him and Cinder. I loved the development between the two, how sweet it was, and how their friendship only continued to grow based on mutual respect. I also -- surprisingly -- enjoyed the shift to Kai's POV. I'm usually one to scrunch my nose when these changes happen in other books, but the third person narration, as well as the further insight into his character, definitely helped in this case. Kai carries a lot of responsibility on his shoulders and it was tough having to see him deal with very difficult situations. Above everything, though, he's a good leader and, even when I found myself screaming \\"Nooooo!!!!\\" at him, I had to admire his actions and how dedicated he was to his people. Welcome to the fictional boyfriend list, Kai.<br /><br />The upcoming books in the Lunar Chronicles will introduce other fairytale characters: Red Riding Hood, Snow White, and Rapunzel. They, along with Cinder, will come together to fight against Levana. Sounds cool, right? Meyer wove a unique, creative story here and I'm looking forward to seeing how she continues to spin these familiar stories and characters into something new and exciting. This is definitely a new favorite series for me and I urge you to pick up Cinder!ed on mutual respect. I also -- surprisingly -- enjoyed the shift to Kai's POV.

B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Very useful.  I clip selected text, web pages and links and can access them later on any of my devices.  I also create short notes and to-do lists with Evernote.  I've only used the free version so far but I love it and recommend it highly.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Before I downloaded Evernote I had no idea just how much it could effect my every day life. I started using it to keep notes for work and to have crochet patterns with me wherever I go. Now I use it for anything I can think of, from grocery lists to game walkthroughs from gamefaqs. I love this app!!
B005Y423ZC|5.0|i was a fan of Adele but after watching her in concert I can't believe what an incredible performer and artists she is. This DVD is the best purchase I have made in a while. I truly feel like it was like seeing her in concert along with the fact that she connects really well with her audience.  I highly, highly recommend this purchase.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I loved the first two books in this trilogy; however, I was marginally disappointed with how this book seemingly just ended when Peeta miraculously shows up healed and they don't explain why.<br /><br />I think if the author had explained both Katnis's trial and Peeta's full recovery, the ending would have been better.
B001974DG0|5.0|I am not a reader of books but this one kept my interest throughout. Koontz has a masterful way of introducing characters and then bringing it all together. I loved this book and would recommend it highly.
B0000028VT|5.0|Given Mariah's status as the greatest selling artist of the 1990's, and the artist with the most #1 billboard hits ever, many critics scramble for ways to condemn her; the official amazon reviewer above is no exception, which is sad as he seems to miss the entire point of her albums.  When \\"Music Box\\" came out, everyone had it and played it.  It spawned several wonderful singles, and, to this day, is entirely fresh.  Unlike so many female pop stars, Mariah Carey writes her own lyrics, helps compose the music, and (particularly in the 1990's) has an incredible voice.  And \\"Music Box\\" is Mariah at the peak of her talents, vocally.    One of the feats Mariah mastered in the 90's was how to construct an album.  Virtually every single album of hers during this period was devoid of filler or dud tracks.  \\"Music Box\\" is the finest example of this:  Literally any of the ten songs could have hit #1 if released as a single; there isn't a weak track on this album, and \\"Music Box\\" is a perfect place to start for the curious.  Although she would venture into more R&B terrain later in her career (with some major success along the way), this was old school, pop Mariah, and for many of her fans, there ain't nothing better!!
B005HSG3VK|5.0|Out of the box you might think it is flimsy, but it most definitely does the job and is very durable.  The weight of the kindle keeps the stand in place, of course it doesn't set up on it's own.  I would highly recommend this product!
B006MHWXMS|4.0|I like this app even more than gtasks. However gtasks is free and this app is definitely not worth 5 bucks. The widget on gtasks is superior though. 5 stars when the widget is scrollable and more customizable.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a really fun game. If you are looking at this you should get it. This is a really easy game to play.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Best part: fun for me, my gf, and her son.    Two objects to the game: feed the Om Nom and retrieve stars.  My gf's six year old son likes to pass levels by feeding the monster and I like to add difficultly by getting all the stars.  This simple game requires thoughtfulness and a careful finger at times and has been hours of fun for my family.  Probably wouldn't play well on a small screen. I'm playing it on a Kindle Fire.

I have completely ZERO interest in the table of Elements, or whatever it's called.  I can't put this book down!  The pictures alone draw you in, and the writer has such a great sense of HUMOR... yes HUMOR, in a book about elements.  Crazy, right?  But it's fascinating and utterly gorgeous.  I didn't know diddly about most elements, and still do not claim to, but it's incredible to learn what some of the elements are used for.  Common household items and everyday \\"things\\" are full of elements that I had never even heard of.  Ok, long story short..  GET THIS BOOK!  It's GORGEOUS!!!

B00003CXC6|5.0|A bandit kills a man and rapes his wife.  Or did a bandit have a fair fight with the man after having sex with a willing wife?  Or...what is the truth?  When there are many views of the same event, can there be one truth or many types of truth?<br />And if there are many types of truth, how can there be justice?  How you decide what is right or wrong if everyboy has a different idea of what happened, who is at fault, or even what the faults were?!?!?<br />Rashomon asks us so many questions that it is impossible to answer them all.  What I can answer is - is this a great movie?  YES.<br />I would suggest watching it a couple of times before watching it with commentary by Donald Richie - he is a good historian but you want to give yourself a chance to understand the film before he gives some of the meanings and layers away.<br />Enjoy!

A 4.5 would be more on the mark, though.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is an excellent app. It allows you to select whether you would like to play a winning deck or a randomly dealt deck. Also, it shows you a video that tells you how to win. There are many options such as choosing whether or not you want it to keep time and score for you. You can also play it Vegas version if you  would like. As an added convenience, once you get everthing turned over and on the table it will put all the cards in their proper places. Enjoy it as much as I do!! :)

B002I9Z8I0|5.0|This item is as advertised.  The only problem was the time it took to reach me.  It was ordered on 11-27 and was not received until 12-16.
0547258305|5.0|I admit, I picked this up and got 50 pages in before I stopped. A year later, on the recommendation of a friend, I tried again.<br /><br />I'm so glad I did. I got very invested in Katsa, her problems of isolation, Po, the goal of saving Bitterblue. I've read some complaints about the author's style of writing, but when you're 400 pages in and dying to know how things end, who cares if the sentence structure is a little bit simple?<br /><br />A note for those complaining that Katsa doesn't change. She does--a lot. [spoiler alert] I mean, at the beginning of the book, Katsa would never let herself fall in love, snuggle with a child, allow herself to depend completely on Po while they were in Monsea battling Leck...she changes a lot.<br /><br />Also, for those complaining about the sex and the lover vs marriage...this is a personal preference which the readers will ultimately decide is acceptable or not. Personally I thought it was a great in-your-face to all that Disney crap. Go Katsa. She chose a partner who would treat her mind and body with respect, love her for her strengths but accept her weaknesses, be devoted to her for life, share his kingdom of worldly goods (which she could care less about, because she can already take care of herself, thank you very much). I think it's actually a great relationship for young readers to look up to.<br /><br />I think the problem with stopping it last year was that Katsa is a little distant from the reader, and it isn't until she sees Po again that I really felt her emotions more clearly. I think I'd also read a ton of paranormal novels before that were super fast paced, and Graceling was so entirely different it was hard for me to adjust. I wouldn't even even classify this as paranormal. Just pure fantasy, and not intense fantasy, either.<br /><br />Overall, a great, great read and a stunning debut. Wow. Loved it.

B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This case is 100% exactly what I was looking for. High quality and SUPER THIN. The case is sturdy and the Fire easily snaps into place and is very tight. It will not slip out accidentally or if dropped, it's a very snug fit.   I think the two best features are the fact the case is so thin and sleek that you almost forget it's on the Fire. Some of the tablet cases are so thick and bulky that they take away from the thin designs of the tablets themselves. The other nice feature is the thin elastic strap on the back of the case which holds the front cover flat against the back cover when it's opened. This is really nice and works well.  I'm not sure how much more there is to say. I've found no problems and no complaints. It's VERY thin, it's sturdy, high quality, the Fire fits perfectly and it looks great.
140053271X|2.0|I bought three of these. I was very very happy of the performance with the original 1.0.1 firmware. However, two of them already upgraded to the 1.1.0 firmware, which immediately erased the ability to use the \\"look\\" functions as internet browser.  One of the readers frost during update and it doesn't recognize the \\"nook\\" menu button anymore...I will return it, luckily it is within the original retail return period.  The second reader seems OK. It is less responsive now though, after the \\"upgrade\\"...Will test it with imported through Callibre books tonight, if it is still OK after firmware update.  The third reader hasn't updated yet, I don't know why. I will return it anyway - I don't want to take the risk.  Conclusion: B&N completely ruined otherwise not bad reader by buggy and restrictive firmware update. It is definitely not worth the money right now.  I have the first generation Nook too, and in general I preferred Nook due to the epub support. I integrated with Callibre and used embedded fonts for non-Latin epub books.  I promoted my Nook readers to friends until this firmware update, because of the OK hardware and epub support. However, considering that B&N is much less popular than its competitor, and popularity means software and application support, and it has no text or Word doc files support, and being extremely restrictive in order to not allow direct internet access to competitive or free content, I am strongly NOT RECOMMENDING purchase of the device. It is OK if given free for a brand new unit.

B005I6EU7U|5.0|I read almost all of the reviews for this item, and am glad I went with my first instinct in thinking that this is a beautiful, unique way to protect and display my new Kindle Fire.  I AM SO HAPPY I DID!!!  This case is everything and more than I ever expected!  I chose the tan cover with it's beautiful detail and embossing.  It has a classic look and feel to it.  When I'm holding my Kindle Fire I feel as though I'm reading an old, classic book.  I can't tell you how many compliments I've received on it. In response to some of the negative comments, I have to disagree with the two main complaints.  The fit is absolutely perfect.  I had no problem at all inserting my Kindle Fire into the elastic bands. It is snug and secure.  Another complaint was that the cover didn't close completely. Some suggestions were to work the rib a bit to get the cover to close, but I found that mine shut perfectly the very first time. I rarely leave a feedback, but I love this cover so much I just had to share my opinion.  You won't be sorry with this one!

B0058RN85O|5.0|First off, this show is great. Poking fun at all and a character line-up that makes for laughs with each show. I ordered this as a gift (and may plan on doing so for years to come) because the price was right (less than $20 for a season on Bluray) and the show is hilarious. The picture quality seems as though it is better on Blu, and may be due to ABC showing 720 content and the Blu is 1080. If you like the show, get these discs, watching this again is still hilarious.
B003GK2216|3.0|**possible minor spoilers  This 1000+ page tome could have been great if it were not simply a rehashing of Pillars of the Earth. Pillars was a fantastic read which I literally could not put down. While reading World Without End I continually had a sense of deja vu because there were just too many similarities, even down to the characters - Merthin was Jack from Pillars, Caris was Aliena, Ralph was William. The storyline was also far too similar, the feminist and the revolutionary young apprentice who between them save a town and have far too many visionary revelations/discoveries to be believable, not to mention the quintessential bad guy. Only Gwenda was original and unfortunately although she started out all right, towards the end she was not a very sympathetic character at all. Furthermore, I actually cringed when Merthin left Knightsbridge, soon followed by Caris. Granted she was not in search of Merthin as in Pillars but still the experiences and the storyline was dangerously close to being a carbon copy of Pillars.  The suspense could also use some tweaking, for example there a quite a number of chapters which end with \\"so-and-so sneezed\\" which inevitably signals an outbreak of the plague, or somebody fearing that they will fall pregnant and then...they do. Another thing which bothered me quite a bit and detracts substantially from the plausibility of the story is the language which is certainly not indicative of the time in which the story is set. While I fully agree that the book would have been tedious and hard to read if the language was true to its time, there are some instances where the language jars you back to reality. For instance, I found the use of the profanities particularly grating - while I have no issue with the use of profanities they were shockingly out of place here. Another example is a character referring to a male as \\"hot\\" which is a term I am sure would not be found in the 1300s. Similarly some of the characters have a vocabulary whichis truly astonishing for an uneducated peasant.   That being said, World Without End would make a wonderful read if you have not already read Pillars. The intrigue, the drama and the romance are woven into a wonderfully rich story spanning many years and you feel yourself immersing yourself in this world and rooting for your favourite characters. I would recommend reading either Pillars of the Earth or World Without End but not both and I will admit I am slightly more partial to Pillars.

B0050AV5MW|4.0|This review is based only on the first book in the series as that is all I have read so far. I decided to read Game of Thrones before watching the series as I prefer to read the book that a movie or series is based on. I found myself enjoying Game of Thrones immensely and I will most definitely be reading the rest of the series.   The book is action packed and I enjoyed reading the story from the perspective of a number of characters. It allows the reader to follow the action in various parts of the Seven Kingdoms and beyond with ease and also creates a bond between the reader and the numerous characters. The world of the Seven Kingdoms also comes alive in this way. It was also refreshing to encounter an author who is not afraid to kill off his main characters and each battle and  sequence is read with bated breath as the reader genuinely cannot predict whether the main character will survive or not. While you may often be saddened to bid farewell to a character you have come to like and are rooting for, this creates a true feeling of suspense and unpredictability in the story. While there are some scenes of violence and hardship I felt that they were not gratuitous in any way and were indicative of the world and the people inhabiting that world.  I look forward to reading the next book and would highly recommend this book to anyone.

B003Y5H5HO|4.0|After viewing the fairly well-produced and well-adapted \\"Girl\\" trilogy of films (based on the Millennium novels by the late Stieg Larrson) by director Niels Arden Oplev, the question, \\"Why see yet another version of this same story?\\" (even if it is done in English, Hollywood style) may just cross one's mind especially in a diminished economy where frugality renders duplication superfluous.  However close to the perfection of the author's vision Noomi Rapace's performance might have been, Rooney Mara's incarnation of Lisbeth Salander seems more nuanced; she smolders with anger and vengeance like her predecessor, but withdraws in pretty silhouettes with a psychological vulnerability that endows her with even more antisocial magnetism and hints at the underbelly personal history yet to be revealed.<br /><br />Even though easy-on-the-eyes Daniel Craig, as the intrepid journalist Mikhal Blomkvist, more than adequately portrays the likeable character with a winning, almost unconscious self-consciousness, he conciliatorily fades into the background when Mara is on the screen.  As in the novel, Salander's edgy efficiency and genius works well against a backdrop of a seemingly well-oiled society equipped with high-speed trains and technology yet rotting from within with a moral corruptness that suggests repressed aggression.  Mara's face mirrors both Lisbeth's fierce rebellion and the forever scars she wears like a tattoo of resistant resilience.<br /><br />Director David Fincher deviates a bit from the gospel of the Larsson text--his Lisbeth admits her past openly to Blomkvist in a TMI scene that isn't true to the sensibility of the written character.  Perhaps, Fincher, worried about the reception of this English version and concerned about executing its sequels, reveals too much to accentuate Lisbeth's misplaced sense of betrayal regarding Blomkvist's limited yet open promiscuity. Perhaps, his perception of her desire to please Blomkvist with her openness and her body even after brutal sexual subjugation underlines her role as woman and her place despite her genius and injured sensibility. This is, after all, a novel, that in Europe tellingly goes by the Swedish title \\"M&auml;n som hatar kvinnor\\" which translates into English as \\"Men who hate women.\\"  The novel's section headings are marked with statistics regarding the percentages of women brutalized by men which, along with key instances in the plotline describing women reduced to victim status due to the sadistic and masochistic actions of their supposed caretakers or loved ones, suggest that even with the seemingly blas&eacute; attitude regarding casual sexual relationships and equality amongst the sexes, there is indeed some disturbing issue that in this culture cannot be rectified by the actions of government or authority but by taking the matter into one's own very capable vigilante hands.<br /><br />In addition, rather than have the duo work together as in the novel to eventually reveal the initiator of a forty-year-old crime, Fincher chooses to film parallel sequences of enlightenment set to the fast-paced sound of European motorcycles and the edgy organic music of the Oscar-winning team of Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross.  This works to cut the overall time of what could have easily been a three-hour police procedural instead of a fascinating character study of an societal outcast and her soon-to-be crusading knight errant.<br /><br />Fincher misses a key flashback scene opportunity where Lisbeth stands and watches the killer die as his car bursts into flames.  Why not have his protagonist shudder with that remembrance from her own past and give the audience the thrill of mutual understanding?  For those non-novel readers, why not an anticipatory frisson of what is to come in the next two installments?  Maybe Fincher thought this would be a TMI moment.<br /><br />Bottom line?  Director David Fincher ([[ASIN:B004HWT6DO The Social Network]]) compacts Stieg Larsson's rambling novel [[ASIN:B0015DROBO The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Millennium Trilogy)]] into two hours and 38 minutes of intense film introducing to a mainstream English speaking audience the edgy pathology and survival of Dragon Girl--social misfit, rebel and genius, Lisbeth Salander.  Be warned the film contains violent rape, the depiction of a mutilated animal and stills of misogynistic torture.  The strength of Rooney Mara's portrayal of the lead character is more than enough reason to revisit this newer version.  Recommended.<br />Diana Faillace Von Behren<br />\\"reneofc\\":B0015DROBO The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo (Millennium Trilogy)]] into two hours and 38 minutes of intense film introducing to a mainstream English speaking audience the edgy pathology and survival of Dragon Girl--social misfit, rebel and genius, Lisbeth Salander.

0307959856|5.0|I very much enjoyed this beautifully written \\"sequel\\" to Pride and Prejudice.  I have read many of them in the past, and so far this is my favorite.  It is a remarkable achievement on many levels.    1.  The language and its rhythm come as close as possible to the original without descending into pastiche.  Elizabeth is just as engaging as she was in the original, and I loved the opportunity to spend some more time with the characters from the original work--something the writing really enabled me to feel I was doing.    2.  The novel is able to take many of the characters, both major and minor, from the original book and keep them in character as they move through its pages and plot.  Mrs. Bennett lives!  3.  The plot kept me riveted, and I was eager to see how it would turn out. It is perfectly true that it is not really a murder mystery, since it lacks any real investigation, but that did not affect my enjoyment of the book.  I thought the portrayal of the legal processes of a murder trial in England in that era was fascinating.  The fact that the book was a page-turner as far as I was concerned was not due to the detective content of the work (which was sparse), but rather to my interest in the characters and enjoyment of the writing style.     4.  P.D. James is 91 years old.  I would like to be breathing and healthy when I am 91, let alone writing magnificent works like this one (which I of course cannot do now, at a considerably earlier stage in my life than the one that P.D. James inhabits, and could not do even when young).    I am astonished at the number of negative reviews for this book.  It is not easy to get me to suspend my disbelief, and it has been a long time since I read a book that held me spellbound to the exclusion of all else until I could finish it (which I did in a day, it is a quick read).  This book accomplished both.  I felt that I was back in a Jane Austen novel, and the world around me just had to go away and leave me alone until I couldfinish it.  Of course, I was then sorry, because it was over!  It is a book to be savored, not devoured.  Oh well, I'll go read it again. . . .

B005ZTFPFQ|5.0|Well....I did purchase the 99 title package and I admit, I did it mainly for Tempest, Red Baron, Major Havoc and Quadrun.  Quadrun 2600 is a hard to find expensive 2600 cartridge so spending ten bucks to get that and a host of other good games suited me perfectly.  I never owned Quadrun and am enjoying it.  I like Real Sports Football too, remembering it as a cool game as a kid.  Yar's Revenge is awesome too.  You can buy smaller packages....there are tons of choices so I'm not sure what complaints are about.  Maybe if you didn't waste hours and small allowance fortunes at the arcades in the day you won't get the nostalgia or the wonder of having all these at the touch of a finger on a perfectly sized screen like the Kindle Fire.  Millipede is great too....Outlaw....I love this.  If you'd told me in 1984 oneday all this stuff would be available in the palm of my hand for a paltry ten bucks, I'd have offered to have you committed.  Is it for everyone?  I thinks so to a degree....friends and family pick up my kindle and this is the first thing they want to play.  And...I'm better at Tempest now than back then....must be the comfort of lounging on the sofa to play instead of being in a smoky, dark, smelly arcade giving away my hard earned quarters one at a time.

B006FLGBGA|3.0|I bought this movie from Amazon.com because of all the good reviews I found on RottenTomatoes.com.<br /><br />On the plus side, if you can ignore all the implausibilities in the plot, \\"Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes\\" is a fun romp of a movie. The actors do a fine job. The special effects are well done. And the premise that a newly developed drug could greatly increase the intelligence of apes is fascinating. That's why I gave the movie three stars.<br /><br />On the negative side, there are so many implausibilities in the film that it's hard to stay engaged.<br /><br />I don't want to spoil the movie for others by giving away too much of the plot. So here are just a few examples of the implausibilities: 1) A man could take a Chimpanzee from a highly controlled and regularly caged environment into his home, and the Chimp would cause no damage but immediately adapt to living in a house. 2) For years, a man could have a Chimpanzee living in his home and take the Chimp for drives in his car without his neighbors' noticing or complaining to the authorities. 3) A Chimp can climb Redwood trees. Chimps, other apes, and monkeys swing from branches. Redwood trees do not have branches that are anywhere near the ground, as is shown in the film. Chimps can no more scale a branchless tree trunk than humans can.<br /><br />It's a shame that the filmmakers weren't more meticulous in crafting this film. Most, if not all, of the gaffes could have been avoided. The Chimp could at first have run amok in the man's house and gradually acclimated himself to it. The man could have lived in a rural setting with no neighbors nearby. A device to climb Redwood tree trunks could have been invented by the Chimp as a problem-solving feat. That would have shown the Chimp's ingenuity.<br /><br />Why the filmmakers didn't problem-solve the script is a mystery. If the plot had been more plausible, it could have been a fine film. However, if you can turn off the reasoning part of your brain, \\"Rise Of The Planet Of The Apes\\" will be a fun romp for you..

B003O86FMW|4.0|This was a decent continuation of the trilogy but I can honestly say that I liked book one- Hunger Games better. The twists in this book were not what I expected which is good but it did not completely suck me in. I would however like to see how the trilogy plays out which is why I will read the third book. Hopefully it will be as engrossing as the first.
1451627289|5.0|There is so much going on, so much happening in 11/22/63, that it's impossible to boil down succinctly what is possibly the moment that this book took hold of me and didn't let go. Could've been at the beginning, with the tale of Harry Dunning and his father's rampage, or it could have been during Al Templeton's speech about the past and Kennedy's impact on it. These are both very near to the opening, so they're no spoilers. What I will say is that this isn't a horror story; well, in a few ways it is, but in other ways it's a science-fiction book, a thriller, a love story, a historical drama. To me it was just an honest story, a really good yarn, one that was gripping and tugging all at the same time. It's been a good while since I last couldn't put something down, and I'm glad that this held me firm.<br /><br />Being a longtime fan of Stephen King, I've been slightly wary of his later writings. Over time they've been tepid (Cell) to masterful (Lisey's Story) and wavering back and forth, always well-written, always keeping me up late, but sometimes leaving me dry at the end. Under The Dome did that, to an extent, and with 11/22/63 I felt for sure that it would happen again. It did not. King doesn't tie all the loose strings (a statement which is slightly ironic) but he doesn't need to; there is a core set of characters who are important, who come and go and return again, and we get glimpses of what they will lead forward into, but our protagonist must ultimately turn away towards his goal: Lee Harvey Oswald. Jake Epping is one of the most relatable characters King has put down on paper in a good long time, and I cared for him quite a bit. His trials are the reader's trials, and when the past tries to keep him from changing things, you feel it how he feels it. King's writing is strong, assured, and strides forward with confidence, something Jake does quite often in the story, and if King ever had a moment where he wasn't sure of where to go, it isn't evident. I refuse to say more for fear of spoilers, but I will say that this novel kept me glued, lost in another time (painted vividly and with no film of nostalgia), and absolutely entertained. I closed the novel satisfied, full and true. Can't ask for anything more than that, and King delivered with gusto.ore for fear of spoilers, but I will say that this novel kept me glued, lost in another time (painted vividly and with no film of nostalgia), and absolutely entertained.
