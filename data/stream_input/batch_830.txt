B0002IQMKM|3.0|Most of the other reviewers have made good points so I'll try to be brief and not repeat. I was always a fair weather Talking Heads fan and finally got fully into them with the live \\"The Name of This Band...\\" release. I was overcome and had to go out and get their first four releases. I feel the best wat to explore this band is to start at the beginning and you can slowly trace their progress from an educated pop band all the way into their more produced rhythms and textures. I always remember a review from Rolling Stone about one of their shows at a festival when they suddenly appeared as an eight piece, or so, band. It may not seem like the same band if you just have one disc of the entire career. It seems jolting somewhat all the transitions they have gone through. I would strongly recommend progressing from :77, More Songs..., Fear of Music, Remain in Light, Speaking in Tongues, True Stories, Little Creatures, all the way to Naked. This way it's a natural progression and showcases the pure genius of their evolution. A good live presentation of this is the Jonathan Demme film \\"Stop Making Sense\\" which opens with Byrne alone on a baren stage and adds one musician per song up to their full strength. I saw this show three times. Once as part of their tour at the Greek, then as a rehearsal at the Long Beach Arena, and finally for the actual filming at the Pantages. Truly one of the greatest concert films ever and a true showing of their changes over the years.
B000EF5NAS|5.0|This movie is moving our happiness to wonderful and it is a great gift to give to a loving wife.  Fried Green Tomatoes is the best and it makes me happy to give it to my loving wife so guys buy it and give it to a woman who you think is special and she would feel how special she is if she recieves this movie as a gift.
B001ED7C58|5.0|My daughter is a fan of the Twilight series.  We have all four books and now the soundtrack.  She had trouble waiting for it to be released.  If you like \\"Twilight\\", this is for you.
B0018QOIXU|3.0|Probably 4-5 stars for Adele and 0 stars for everything else about the CD.    I first saw Adele on CBS Sunday Morning a few weeks ago.  She has an incredible voice with a nicely matured, edgy sound to it. Her vocal control and ability to do almost anything with a note is a joy to listen to.  So I went out and bought the only CD she has available - Adele 19.  BEWARE:  The voice is still wonderful.  She writes great songs.  BUT the background \\"music\\" will drive most musical listeners crazy.  It is irritating and a horrible sound.  Bad use of electronic stuff - drums and bass or at least people who sound electronic.  Really poor orchestrations featuring way too much going on at one time.  The result is that it becomes better NOT to listen to Adele than to wade through all that stuff.  She is also very young and inexperienced and needs someone to provide her with some direction both in her own approach and especially someone who knows how best to showcase her voice.  But as good as Adele may be, it is not good enough to overcome the poor aspects of this production.
B000FSME1A|5.0|[[ASIN:B000FSME1A Apocalypse Now - The Complete Dossier (Two-Disc Special Collector's Edition)]]  Many thought this would be the Vietnam film to end them all. Parts of this long film ARE BRILLIANT. The opening sequences are stunningly atmospheric - VITTORIO STORARO's Cinematography is Superb. Martin Sheen's voice - over narration is another successful ingredient of the film. But the movie is also often slow and pretentious. It's action throws in every possible atrocity to shock the viewer: in words as well as in pictures Francis Ford Coppola plays heavily for effect. MARLON BRANDO is superb as Colonel Kurtz. Sheen hacks him to pieces, in a terribly GORY SEQUENCE, with a Machete to symbolise the simultaneous slaughter of a sacrificial buffalo. Coppola does attempt to balance his elements with injections of some black humour, including a superbly choreographed attack by helicopters to the music of 'RIDE OF THE VALKYRIE'. Robert Duvall gives one of the BEST PERFORMANCES of his career. Look-out for Harrison Ford in a very tiny cameo.
B001EO2UJK|1.0|Sound peaks and valleys, the dynamic range of the music, is gone.  One example - Listen to eleventh earl of mar in both new remix and a 1994 edition, from second 30 to sec 40, and listen that the climatic volume swell of the passage is gone. So is all the rest.<br />Shame on the producer and also the band for not taking care of such an important matter.<br /><br />About th dvd's they are great.  As for the band members, Gabriel and Hackett are humble stars, Collins so/so, and Rutherford and Banks are really arrogant pricks that never give proper credit to Gabriel and Hackett.<br /><br />I cannot believe that rhino has disgraced permanently Genesis music.  Try to get the older versions, not criminally compressed as this version.
B00005BL2A|5.0|Exciter seems to be the one album that too many DM fans have regarded as lesser than their previous work. If you are looking for quick catchy top ten hits, then yes you should pass this one up. But if you, like me, love it when artists express themselves however they feel regardless of what the public expects, then this is the album that gives us Depeche Mode, naked. The electronic music plays richly, beautifully, transporting the listener to another realm, a feat accomplished by very few artists. This is art. This is musical genius. Absolutely, Depeche Mode gets better each album.
0316017922|1.0|With effortless ease, Malcolm Gladwell once again proves he is a master of conceptualizing the abstract, simplifying the complex, and articulating the mundane. Blending together a rich tapestry of scientific literature, illustrative examples, anecdotal accounts, and intuitive observation, Gladwell poses his argument on how the outliers of society - those individual that are distinctly more successful than the norm - are more a result of their sociodemographics, family lineage, and societal evolutions than they are individual capabilities. In short, Gladwell states that pure genetic endowment or aptitude alone is not enough to predict our future, but that culture also plays an undeniable role in steering our course.<br /><br />While not the most profound notion ever proffered, Gladwell does do an amazing job of attracting a readership to an interesting topic. He has a keen eye for questioning the status quo and helping us realize how much chance and environmental variation go into shaping icons, moguls, and geniuses. Simultaneously, he is a progenitor of ideas and an inventor of expressions. However, much of Malcom's intellectual opportunism relies heavily upon isolated research, broad generalizations, and a nonsensical number of \\"if, then\\" contingencies that nearly create a tautological story.<br /><br />It may truly be that achieving eminence, in the sense of achieving supreme social status or creating a legacy, is the result of a unique set of circumstances that allow one to achieve their full potential. However, at the same time, it is also true that achieving such status is the result of a particular configuration of independent traits all of which have to be present or present in a certain degree to yield the result. Gladwell only manages to dance around both these ideas without producing any sound or substantial evidence as to what makes success, simply only chalking a major influence up to \\"culture\\" and \\"practice.\\" Instead, he cites intelligent studies that are nearly 100 years old (e.g., Terman, 1920), highlights the failure of \\"one\\" intellectual genius named Chris Lagan while arbitrarily discussing the success of a wealthy physicist, provides untestable hypotheses about the role of culture in influencing behavior. Combine these disjointed statements together and ... presto, you have Gladwell's selective examples to form a somewhat coherent argument for his notion of the deterministic forces in our lives. It is almost a truism in any science that post hoc theorizing and single cases are an impossible basis for making any kind of argument about causation. Any one of Gladwell's \\"anecdotes\\" could be easily accounted for by another alternative explanation.<br /><br />For instance, Gladwell asserts that a major reason for success is due to practice. He uses the example of Bill Gates, who, being born in 1955, was perfectly situated to embrace and practice the computer during his twenties. He also states, due to cultural differences, that Asian children are statistically better at math than American children due to a practice-orientated attitude. These are sound arguments. One of the main ingredients to learning is practice: this allows time to make errors and correct ourselves while converting learning from short-term memory to long-term memory. Practice also clarifies and strengthens the neural connections that are formed while we confront new and familiar material, thus allowing us to build deeper comprehension and cognitive schemas. Nevertheless, there is much more. Mastering materials requires the appropriate focus and attention of the individual. Bill Gates, Asian children, or any other \\"anecdote\\", must be able to remain vigilant and persistent in the material they are pursuing. If one is able to maintain greater attention, they may be able to extract more information at a single time. For example, if any student is to become better at math, they may simply need to place greater care and intention into their actual studies by focusing on what is being said, what they are actually understanding, and what they can actually remember.<br /><br />In another vein of reasoning, there is much to be said about natural abilities and aptitudes. A higher cognitive ability can, and does, facilitate a greater amount of knowledge acquisition and is highly predictive of future job performance (Hunter & Schmidt, 1998). On a similar note, one can read Howard Gardner's theory of multiple intelligences or Steinberg's triarchic theory of intelligence to see how people may naturally excel in different domains of life, such as musical or interpersonal skills. This would imply that someone like Bill Gates had a predisposition to understanding logical/mathematical concepts, thus providing him a natural advantage in his field. Finally, one might consider research by Csikszentmihalyi (1991, 1996) on creative giants, flow, and experts. People that excel are essentially those with a singular commitment to mastering one domain. These individuals have an \\"intense curiosity\\" and find the topic \\"so absorbing and challenging\\" that they enter a pure state of engagement known as \\"flow.\\" In short, one must be intensely passionate, interested, and stimulated by their goals and life aims, not simply a sum of practice hours.<br /><br />Mr. Gladwell similarly raises the notion that cultural traditions may play a role in plane crashes, that the 1990 crash of Avianca Flight 52 over Long Island might have had something to do with the pilots' being Colombian. Mr. Gladwell argues that the pilots came from a culture with \\"a deep and abiding respect for authority\\" -- which suggests that the first officer was reluctant to speak up when the exhausted captain failed to do so, and that both men failed to talk forcefully to the air traffic controllers, who were tough New Yorkers, unaccustomed to the pilots' polite language. Of course, Gladwell, not being a cross-cultural researcher, uses an extreme example without any empirical evidence of his own to rule out other alternatives. For instance, what if the pilots simply had timid or introverted personalities? What if the specific flight school they attended taught them to always listen to the air traffic controllers? Perhaps climate differences between New York and Colombia accounted for the crash, with the pilots not being used to differences in landing conditions? What if it was differences in the family lives of these two specific pilots as opposed to macro-cultural differences (e.g., really strict parents)? What if the pilots are simply responding with anxiety and fear to a novel situation (e.g., being in a new country or having a new job), thus causing them to make mistakes?<br /><br />Going beyond Gladwell's arguments, materialistic success in life (getting ahead through achieving power, status, or recognition) is at least partially influenced by differences in personality. Those who are dominant, aggressive, ambitious, and entrepreneurial tend to take more risks, be more assertive, be more determined, and take on heavier work load (Hogan, 1996). These individual tend to obsess about making gains and achievements through their life and establishing a prominent career. These individual are \\"more likely\\" to work harder and exert greater effort in obtaining their goals. Furthermore, individuals that have higher degrees of self-efficacy or competence in a specific area tend to cope better during setbacks, exert more effort in learning material, and approach novel tasks with enthusiasm.<br /><br />To conclude, Gladwell once again demonstrates he does a good job of writing a book that captures the imagination and reasoning of many. However, its flaw rests in the lack of critical reasoning, extreme oversimplification, and biased selectivity in finding examples to support his ideas. If you enjoy an intriguing read without a substantial amount of sound scientific theory and evidence, then check out \\"Outliers.\\" However, if you want to read a more rigorous, stimulating, and substantial piece, please check out Simonton's \\"Greatness: Who Makes History and Why\\" - [...]<br /><br />For additional reads on natural individual differences, please look into William Wright's (1998) \\"Born That Way\\" discussing how genetics account for nearly 50 percent of who we are, or Judith Richard Harris's (1998) \\"Nurture Assumption,\\" contending that the primary source of environmental influence on personality comes from our peer groups. The preponderance of evidence in the behavioral sciences indicate that there is a strong genetic basis for individual differences which interact in unique ways with our environment to determine who we will become.r alternatives.

B001GKYBXA|5.0|McCartney's experimental work is what distinguishes him most as Artist. Superb piece, highly recommended for anyone who appreciates quality music.
0316017922|5.0|I loved this book. I couldn't put it down and found myself reading it well into the night. The author gives fascinating details about what it really takes to be a success. It isn't doing \\"the secret\\" and wishing for success, its about being born in the right time and place and under the right circumstance along with being a hard worker.<br />I loved the anecdotes Gladwell uses and found some of the stories heart catching. GLadwell is an excellent writer and I have become a new fan.<br />Susan Barnes[[ASIN:1419698370 Love Magic]]
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Classic Depeche. Any reviewer who gives this less than 4 stars should listen to it again really. Depeche Mode is that rare band that remains solid and expands on their creative side every album. This one will appeal to those looking for more the \\"classic\\" DM sound. Amazingly rich, superbly well textured album from start to finish.
006145785X|5.0|This book is for intelligent readers in finance or marketing fields. I belong to both groups and find it very useful for marketing ideas as well as my own financial decision making flaws. Human behaviour is an important component of economics which is often not given as much exposure as it deserves.  I highly recommend this book.
0312370849|5.0|A modern day American journalist becomes obsessed with the near-forgotten round up of Jews living in Paris in July 1942 (later to be sent to Auchwitz) and more specifically, the plight of a desperate young Jewish girl, Sarah.      This mesmerizing story unfolds through chapters bouncing between the perspectives of Julia (the journalist) and Sarah (the Jewish girl).  Julia discovers a personal connection to the young girl that threatens her relationship between herself and her husband's Parisian family. The round-up is noted as an embarrassment to Parisians: the story demonstrates both the vunerability of Jewish people in pre-occupied France and powerlessness to help felt by non-Jews.      I was completely captured by this tragic story.  I had a hard time putting the book down.  After I finished one chapter, I could hardly resist the next. Well written, with characters that my heart ached for -- one of the best books I've read in a long time.
0307265730|5.0|Loved it! So real:  some stories are so sad. Great writing, as always.   Evelyn
B0013FSL3E|2.0|The movie is pretty good, though I'd of rather seen them spend the time and money this took to produce on Toy Story 3 or even Cars 2 instead. There's basically no dialog in this movie, which would make it great for little kids around 2 to 3 yrs of age, yet it lacks any color for such young kids so the story for the most part comes in a little boring. Don't get me wrong, it's still a must own movie for kids, I just thought Toy Story 1 and 2 and Cars were so much better. I was expecting something equal to or greater than these movies and it greatly disappointed.    My real reason for this review though was my absolute disappointment in the cheap packaging. It's not even in a regular DVD case, it comes in a cheap cardboard package! A movie for kids in a package that can't even survive adults, let alone children. I thought this was a great price, now I see why. I'd of been much happier paying the $4 higher local retail price and received the movie in an actual plastic DVD case than this. They could have at least warned people of this in the description, you come to expect certain things when you buy a DVD, like for it to come in a standardized type package.
B0013FNC38|5.0|Jason Mraz is an amazing musician in that he is so versitile!  I am 47, my daughters are 12 and 15, and we all love his music.  He sings something for everyone on this album.

B001EO2UKO|5.0|WHEN I FIRST LISTENED TO IT, I WAS MISSING THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT RHYTHMS OF HER PAST ALBUMS. WHEN I WAS ALONE ONE NIGHT, HAD SOME RED ZIN, LIT SOME CANDLES, I FINALLY GOT IT. IT IS REALLY, REALLY PERSONAL AND A MIX BETWEEN DIDO/SADE/TRACY CHAPMAN/THE CARPENTERS. I FIND IT ABSOLUTELY MESMORIZING ESPECIALLY WHEN I PUT ON A SET OF HEADPHONES AND REALLY HEARD THE MUSIC AND THE LYRICS. ONE SONG THAT I CAN'T STOP LISTENING TO OVER AND OVER IS THE DAY BEFORE THE DAY. IT IS ONE OF THE MOST HEART WRENCHING SONGS I'VE HEARD SINCE KING OF SORROW BY SADE. I'VE LOST MANY LOVED ONES IN THE PAST 2 YEARS AND I HAVEN'T RELATED TO A SONG LIKE THAT IN YEARS. EVEN IF IT'S NOT ABOUT LOSS BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT SHE WAS THINKING WHEN SHE WROTE IT, IT'S HOW I RELATED TO IT. THE SIMPLICITY OF THE GUITAR AND THE VOCAL ARRANGEMENT IS FLAWLESS. A LOT OF REVIEWS ARE LOVING GRAFTON STREET AND IT'S THE ONE SONG THAT I'M TRYING TO FIND IT'S PLACE ON THE ALBUM. I ALSO LOVE QUIET TIME, NEVER WANT TO SAY IT'S LOVE, AND LET'S DO THE THINGS WE NORMALLY DO. DIDO, I GET IT. I REALLY GET THE ALBUM. IT'S ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! THANK YOU FOR STAYING TRUE TO WHO YOU ARE AND NOT FOLLOWING A NORM.
0743437497|5.0|My favorite King novel,second only to the exorcist all time in the realm of plot based novels.
B001F0VHEM|3.0|I like Pink and this album is fun and have a few good tracks (I don't believe you it's like she's having a lot of pain). But Funnhouse it's one step back after \\"I'm not dead\\" because she's not thinking in music, just in her persona as a \\"divorce woman\\".
B001GQACGE|1.0|So, I'm no music \\"critic\\" but we are all entitled to our opinion. Never have I been a die hard Beyonce fan but have enjoyed her first and second albums with the first one being my favorite. Even then, I would buy the album and wait until it looked like the BeYAWNce hype would die down. I just opened B-Day last week as it had been on my shelf since it released, still wrapped in plastic. When I opened B-Day it gave me life so I was pumped for the release of I Am..Sasha Fierce.    Thankfully, and I mean thankfully my girlfriend who enjoys Beyonce's music sent me her MySpace page and told me to check it out before I ran down to Target and spent my $10.     BAYBEEEEEE....let me be the first to tell you that I wanted to mix Vicodin and Vodka while listening to I Am. It put me in a bad mood. I agree with one of the previous reviewers how it sounds like one never ending song. I had to stop and really listen to see if she was singing a new song because they all sound the same.    Sasha Sleepy was indeed a waste of my time. I don't want to hear an almost 30 year old married woman talking about her swagger being like that of a hustler, the paper in her pocket and somebody putting a ring on it. Come on now! Why does she sound like Mike Jones, who? Mike Jones! Who told her to speak that way? I like the classy yet sassy Beyonce, not this ghetto \\"o-so-hood\\" mess. So now all these little girls are going to be telling dudes to \\"put a ring on it\\" at 16, 17 and 18...there is more to it then just the ring. Marriage is hard work, don't get me started. LOL. With so many YOUNG girls looking up to her I feel this side of the album was an even bigger disappointment.    As I have told my friends I need Beyonce to take a real break like Brandy...lol...and make a fierce comeback after having a child or two. Maybe then she will have something worth listening to two full albums - not six songs on one album and a few more on the other. I am looking forward to what her music will be like after shebecomes a mother and has been married for a few years...none of this Sasha Sleepy nonsense.
B001GQACGO|2.0|I hear this album and it's completely boring! She needs make a clear defination of her music because this is terrible!
B001EOQWEO|5.0|Maybe the best pixar movie to date, running close to the incredibles, if buying this is a question of whether the movie is good or not, there is no question. As far as the features the 3 discs include, they are pretty neat, good for anyone interested in animation or the process. Also includes a hour and a half long history of pixar, which is great. Goes in depth about the upcoming of pixar, great for anyone who is interested. I loved this package, I'm a big fan of pixar's movies but this one is above and beyond. BurnE is also included, another short on top of the already amazing Presto, great stuff!!
B001FSDOZO|4.0|Nickelback returns after a 3 year break to bring you another pleasing album to add to their lost list.  This is the 5th album of theirs I have (everyone since \\"The State\\").  Of those 5, I'd give one 5 stars, 2 4.5 stars and this one and \\"The State\\" I'd say are 4 stars.  Though it's not their best work, it still is a nice album.  Short, like most of their albums, at only 11 songs and 43 minutes, you still get 7 good songs, 1 almost classic, and 3 ok songs, no bad ones.. Once again the 4 man Canadian group doesn't disappoint and I'd recommend this one as well as their other albums.    #1 - 8.5  #2 - 8.5  #3 - 7  #4 - 8  #5 - 7  #6 - 9  #7 - 7.5  #8 - 9.5  #9 - 8.5  #10 - 8  #11 - 9
B000VRSTK0|1.0|By the fact that nearly all the reviewers of this CD have an 6th-grade grasp of grammar and punctuation.    In response to the many comparisons drawn between Andrew W.K. and various hair metal bands, I would say that such comparisons aren't fair. Andrew W.K. is far less talented than any popular 80's metal band. I'd go so far as to say he's less talented than Britney Spears. Power chords aren't that impressive if you don't have anything to say.
B001ED7C58|4.0|This is a great soundtrack, especially the added treat of having Rob Pattinson performing. I wish they had added an additional track or two of his, including him playing the piano for Bella's Lullaby. They missed that focus in the movie as well. I prefer Stephanie Meyer's playlist better, but there is some great new tunes on this CD.
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|how this band is not huge in the usa is beyond me. the sound, riffs,etc... are great!!! one can clearly hear the influence from bands such as: metallica, pantera,guns & roses, just to name a few. this cd is a must have for metal fans!!!
B000002A3T|5.0|4.5<br />I'm a very big Pink floyd fan. I own most of their discs and It's amazing how different yet spectacular each of them are! This one is no exception. From my experience this is their most soothing album. Listening to it gives you a certain calm feeling. A lot of reviewers are saying that the album is no good because it's different than the rest. And it is the most different. But In this situation that's definetly not a bad thing. The only thing I would have to say negatively about the disc is that the lyrics slightly suffer from the past.<br />  I also would have to say that the music sounds like its coming from the early seventies. Another bonus for me!<br />all in all a have to have for any Pink Floyd fan!
B00003CXRM|5.0|In the late 60s, my husband and reviewed films as stringers for a syndicated critic. If you watch enough of them, you can recognize quality very quickly. \\"Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" is the kind of motion picture that comes along only once in a generation. It is mythic, original, funny, warm, and touching. We enjoy watching it again and again. Even the soundtrack is a masterpiece.[[ASIN:B00004XQ83 O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]<br />In fact, we purchased a copy of the film after our twenty-something daughter played the CD for us.

B0017JKEL8|5.0|I had read about the critical acclaim for Mad Men and knew it wons awards etc. but had not seen an episode.  I just bought a Blu-Ray player and needed a test disc so I bought Mad Men Season One.  Wow!  Excellent!  I've watched 11 episodes in 3 days and can't wait to finish the Blu-Ray disc set ASAP.  It just sucks you in. I've just pre-ordered Season Two's Blu-Ray disc set,....<br /><br />The quality of the video in 1080 / Blu-Ray is outstanding. It easily convinced me that upgrading to a Blu-Ray player from a very good DVD player was worth it.
B001KVZ69I|4.0|You'd think it would be easy to determine how to feel about \\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas,\\" but no, it isn't. Despite the heavy subject matter, it tells such a simple, direct story, and there are virtually no gray areas in terms of character development. Everyone is defined so thoroughly at the start of the film that they never really have the chance to become something else, which is to say that there's no sense of maturation. I believe this also applies to the main character, an eight-year-old German boy named Bruno (Asa Butterfield), who at the height of Hitler's regime moves with his family from Berlin into the countryside. Their new home is directly next to a concentration camp, where an eight-year-old Jewish boy named Shmuel (Jack Scanlon) spends his time sitting at the electrified border. When Bruno goes exploring one day, he meets Shmuel, and even though they're separated, the two become friends. Despite the fact that Bruno learns a great deal over the course of the film, I'm hard pressed to say that he transitions from ignorance to knowledge. Quite simply, there's just so much he doesn't understand.    In all fairness, that's probably a much more realistic approach to the material. We've seen so many films that adhere to the \\"Amazing Grace\\" principle, in which characters are lost then found, blind then able to see. We get nothing like that from \\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas.\\" Bruno is incredibly ignorant, mostly because he grew up in a world that wanted to keep him that way. He hears and sees anti-Semitic propaganda all around him, and yet we're never really sure if he believes any of it. I say this because he's the kind of child that asks a lot of questions, most of which aren't answered satisfactorily; those that are answered inevitably lead to even more questions, which is a good thing because it proves he's actually thinking. His only problem is that he's never able to come to a conclusion. All he can do is keep wondering why certain things are theway they are. That may explain why he would much rather read an adventure story than a history textbook--daring explorers in fantasy worlds are much easier to understand.    Bruno is essentially the film's strongest element. Not so strong are most of the other characters, which are all so rigidly constructed. Bruno's father, Ralf (David Thewlis), is a strict Nazi soldier who oversees the neighboring concentration camp. Bruno's mother, Elsa (Vera Farmiga), spends much of the film is a blissful state of ignorance, aware that Jews are the enemy but blind to the fact that many are tortured and killed; even when she discovers why the smoke emanating from the camp's chimneys is so foul-smelling, she can do nothing but cry uncontrollably. Bruno's twelve-year-old sister, Gretel (Amber Beattie), is strong-headed and hopelessly brainwashed.     The rest of the supporting characters were never given the chance to fully develop, which is a shame considering the potential they all had. One is Bruno's grandmother (Sheila Hancock), who doesn't get along with her son because, apparently, she doesn't quite buy into Hitler's vision for a glorious future. Another is Lieutenant Kotler (Rupert Friend), a young Nazi soldier that Gretel has a crush on. The dramatic possibilities for this character were mostly overlooked, reducing him to little more than a passing reference. There are, in fact, only two supporting characters that work well. One is Shmuel, who, because of his age, is just as ignorant as Bruno; he knows that life is hard for him in the camp, but he has no real idea how things work under a Nazi regime. Another is Pavel (David Hayman), an imprisoned Jew who's often sent to work in Bruno's family's kitchen. When Bruno cuts his leg after falling off a handmade tire swing, Pavel tends to his wounds; when he tells Bruno that he used to practice as a doctor, Bruno fails to understand why a doctor would give that up to be a potato peeler.    His ignorance plays a vital role in the film's emotionally draining ending, which will no doubt divide audiences. There's no resolution--there's only a slow, agonizing fade to black. There's also the sickening feeling that, as far as the characters are concerned, absolutely nothing has been learned. There was an audible reaction amongst the people I saw this film with. As we all walked out of the theater, one woman behind me said, \\"What a disappointing ending.\\" I was compelled to turn around and calmly ask her, \\"What more needed to be said?\\" The way I see it, the final scene of \\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" is perfectly acceptable; given the course of events, which I obviously can't describe, there would be no way to prolong the ending without it seeming forced.    As I said at the beginning, it isn't easy determining how to feel about this film. It's an above average story of friendship, and I was certainly moved a great deal by it. But it's not without its flaws, especially when it comes to character development. On the whole, I think it's fair to say that it's an unforgettable film, highly emotional and deeply thought provoking. \\"The Boy in the Striped Pajamas\\" will not give everyone what they want, but that doesn't mean it doesn't say everything it needs to say. In other words, it tells a complete story. It doesn't, however, give us complete characters, which is clearly a disappointment given the powerful nature of the subject matter. And while only a minor thing, some may also be bothered by the fact that an entirely British cast portrays German characters. If seeing this movie depends on a single reason, let it be Asa Butterfield, who does a wonderful job as Bruno, a curious, naïve young boy. Of all the characters, his was the most compelling.
B00129H7VS|5.0|First of all let me just say that i have never seen Band of brothers before so I'm not a blind fanboy or anything like that , and because I'm not an american so i thought this mini series is not going to be interesting to me , However this mini series is highly praised everywhere and it have 9.6 score on IMDB plus it won the Golden Globe award and Emmy as the BEST series made for TV , so i said to myself lets give it try       So far i have seen only 5 episodes on the BLU-RAY and i have to say that the picture quality is insanely good i own over 30 Blu ray movies and series like Planet Earth, Band of brothers picture quality beat every movie i have ever seen ,yes even Disney Blu rays like pirates, the colors is perfect and its crystal clear, its just UNREAL how good its, i was really surprised i didn't expect TV series picture quality to beat Movies picture quality (Its simply the Best picture quality so far on blu ray to me, but sometimes picture quality jump from crystal clear to \\"extremely\\" Grainy on some parts which is intended i believe)     Blu-ray.com reviewed the series today also and gave the picture quality 5/5 and everything else 5/5 kinda XD        I have only seen 5 episodes so far! and i don't want it to end ;( that's why i'm watching it slowly, to be honest i have always hated and avoided World war Movies because to me they are boring as hell, i have heard the story god damn million time in books/video games and Hollywood movies even school books and most of the times each version of the movie is different so you don't know which version is real or accurate about what happened in the world war 2 because a lot of movie directors change events and make them different to sell tickets, but with band of brothers the men who went to the war speaks to you and tell you there REAL story \\"there is picture in picture mode where you can watch the movie and small screen like 1/4 of the TV pop and the Real people who was at the event speaks and its optional\\"Band of brothers is a masterpiece its Story,Characters,Script, Events,Sound is too good plus its very emotional story.... i don't know where to start about this series it just blow my mind from its goodness    I hope this review was helpful to you
B001ED7C58|3.0|I enjoy most of the tracks on this soundtrack with exception, of course, to some songs that don't appeal to my usual genre.  I admit, Rob Pattinson's song has grown on me- if the boy could just ANNUNCIATE already...otherwise it's ok.  Paramore sounds the same a lot of the time.  However, some of the tunes move me greatly.  For example, The Black Ghosts, Muse, and Carter Burwell's adaptation of 'Bella's Lullaby' is amazing- wish it were longer than it is.  One thing I am desperate for is the Radiohead song played at the END of the film itself but is not on the actual soundtrack.  Too bad it isn't ON the soundtrack!      I enjoy the mix on the soundtrack itself and with a couple of exceptions; I highly recommend this cd to anyone who can enjoy a good mix of sounds along with the one or two songs you just have to hit the 'next' button to.
B000002HO3|5.0|This album is Simply everything you need in a greatest hit album. Every song is a hit!!!!!!!!!! you will not regret this purchase. I highly recommend it!
B001ED7C58|5.0|This is a great soundtrack.  All of the tracks are perfect.  I especially love \\"Tremble for my beloved\\" and \\"Never Think\\".  The musical score \\"Bella's Lullaby\\" is so beautiful that I went ahead and bought \\"Twilight the score\\" also and it's just dreamy!
0316017922|5.0|At the heart of every great book is a great story. All great writers are great storytellers. Malcolm Gladwell is a great storyteller. He draws you in and challenges the things that you \\"know\\" are real. He examines that which we know about success. We look at successful people and examine what it is that has made them successful. He looks at the elements of success with a reporters eye. I found this book to be a compelling read and easily one of the BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR.
B001GQACGO|2.0|Well, I did slog through it twice.  Why? I don't know.<br /><br />Many of the other reviewers have already nailed it so there is not much left to say.  \\"If I Were a Boy\\" and \\"Halo\\" are 5-Star songs and the other 14 tracks are album filler AT BEST.  \\"Sasha Fierce\\" must have mugged Beyonce on the way to the studio, there's just no spark in most of the songs.  It's like my radio got stuck on some Adult Contemporary station and I couldn't change the dial.<br /><br />This album suffers from the same problem as Jennifer Hudson's...great vocal talent spoiled on terrible material.  Download the key tracks and SKIP this \\"double\\" album fraud.  B, come back home!

B001ACH4DS|5.0|This is an absolutely awesome album! I knew that when he won American Idol, David Cook wouldn't disappoint us. If you like Rock music in the line of Bon Jovi and Chris Daughtry, then you'll definitely like this one! Two big thumbs up for David Cook! I hope to see/hear many more CDs like this!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Taylor Swift's 2nd album, \\"Fearless\\" is AWESOME!!! Taylor is a GREAT singer/songwriter and if you thought her first album was Great, wait until you hear this one, Awesome! Five Stars. A must buy for fans of Country Music.
B0019T9FL6|5.0|Although Jennifer didn't win American Idol, she has delivered the best debut album by far of any of the previous black idol contestants. Her range is great from R&B to gospel. The entire album is worth the money. I love the collaboration with Ludacris it was really hip and fun. I can't wait to hear her next album.
0670020745|5.0|Working in the health care field I have seen a lot of changes in the  last 30 years. We look at strokes and dementia differently than before. It was nice for someone to say \\"I'm in here, come and get me\\". A new look at the patients that I care for. More kindness, more wondering at what is whirling through their minds and a knowing that they are communicating I just need to figure out what they are saying. Great book and Probably the most insightful and helpful book I have ever read. Thank you Jill Bolte Taylor.
B001F7MSFM|5.0|Be warned! Strange things have started happening in the Tarpalsfan household ever since viewing the movie; Hellboy: The Golden Army. Mom's have started buying comics and daughters have started talking about blue fish guys! Things have only gotten worse  since the purchase of the dvd version of Hellboy: The Golden Army! Terrible things such as disk abuse-as in I can't stop watching this movie.  Favorite heros return such Hellboy(duh) Liz Sherman, Abe Sapien, Dr, Tom Manning and new to the Hellboy movies, one of my favorites: Johann Krauss! Ectoplasmic man-from B.P.R.D. comic fame! All we need now is Kate and Roger!  There are elves-trolls and more. And best of all a super hero adventure that isn't so dark that you can't enjoy it. The end was a little sad for me-sniff-poor..nevermind..don't mention his name out loud-because if my daughter tells me how cute the blue guy is once more-I'm gonna toss my movie out a window and follow it out!

B001CJJWV6|1.0|I was very disappointed when I watched this Blu Ray version of Jimi's historic concert at Monterey.  I had already purchased the regular DVD version of this feature so I hoped the Blu Ray version would surpass that. I was very mistaken.  Correct me if I'm wrong but I thought Blu Ray technology equals true HD which, if I'm not mistaken, should be in wide-screen format, right?  Well, Jimi's whole Monterey performance is presented here with those annoying black-bars and either side of my HD wide-screen tv. Trust me, it's not the settings on my tv.  It's simply the way that the film is presented on this \\"blu ray\\" disc.  A total rip-off.  Am I missing something here?  If you have the DVD version already, save your money because the Blu Ray version is exactly the same presentation.
045122499X|4.0|I had greatly enjoyed Ken Follett's Pillars of the Earth, and so I was looking forward to World Without End. While not exactly a sequel, his second medieval novel picks up in the same town of Kingsbridge two and a half centuries later, so that his first novel is the local history and its characters the ancestors of the characters of his second novel. It completely lived up to my expectations, and held me rapt. Once again he has woven a fascinating tale of love, ambition (both lofty and venial), and intrigue around an engaging set of characters, and enriched with a depth of historical context. While engrossed in the struggles of an independent-minded woman, an excellent architect with a poor start in life, a brutish knight, and a scheming prior, I inadvertently learned a heap of history, such as the economic development of medieval English boroughs, the wars of King Edward III in France, and the principles of medieval medicine. It was fascinating to me to learn things like how the wool trade gave way to the cloth trade, how feudal lords lost control of their tenant laborers, what the experience of the Plague was like, and how brutal the English invaders were in France. (That last item gives me a new appreciation for the famous Rodin sculpture The Burghers of Calais.) These historical details are not the least bit pedantic, but are vividly described, forming integral background to the rich tapestry of Follett's gripping characters and story. Through a span of a generation, the story explores, among other themes, the interesting question of what options were available for a smart, independent woman in the mid-14th century. I thoroughly enjoyed this fascinating historical tale.
B000KCHWCM|5.0|If it was not for Amazon, the Reveiwers, and Sellers I would be up a musical creek without a paddle. I would not have known of this release of Hunky Dory, or liked my chances of buying this release.    Hunky Dory is my all time No1 Album, which even surprises me, considering my No1 Rock Albums are Tonights The Night by Neil Young and Bringing It All Back Home By Bob Dylan. Iam not a reveiwer, although I have played the reveiwer in the past, and would  not be able to do the album justice. Only to say Art (lyricly abstract) as never sounded so emotional or searching to my ears.    Being a  mini Lp jacket version caught my interest. After reading reviews on the better sound decided to buy.This being my third upgrade: first upgrade; 1990 RYKODISC, secound upgrade; 1999 EMI (24 bit remastering). Begining a Japanese pressing there is usally a improvement in sound and the album does sound better, and the improvement is more than a slight one.     To me this upgrade was worth the purchase, and I do not have to wait another 9 years for a Deluxe or Collectors Edition
B0016NF06O|5.0|Was delightfully suprised by this album.  I've always admired both men, but the two of them together brings back a feeling to music that has been missing.
006135323X|5.0|A well written and engaging look at some \\"irrational\\" behaviors that turn out to be  - who knew?!?! - a whole lot less randon than we thought.  I may never look at a sale flyer, or even a resturant menu the same way again.
031237593X|5.0|Everyone knows the stories about the monster, Richard III, who killed his nephews, the poor little princes in the tower. But what if the stories were wrong? What if they were lies perpetrated to discredit Richard in order to justify Henry VII stealing the throne of England? They say that the winner gets to write the history books and since the Tudors won, they made sure that their version of events leading up to Bosworth Field painted them in the best light and condemned Richard as a vile murderer who deserved to die.<br />Historians have long since come to believe that Richard was not the man portrayed in Shakespeare's \\"Richard III\\" but a generous and honorable man who tried to do the right thing for his country. The play is based on stories that were written by supporters of the Tudor family. Also keep in mind that the Bard was writing during the reign of Elizabeth I, the granddaughter of the man who defeated Richard in battle and seized the crown of England. With only a tenuous claim to the throne, Henry Tudor had to make it seem as if he was the country's savior -- not the leader of a coup.<br />This is a fascinating book about political intrigue and the struggle between these two powerful factions who both felt they had the right to rule England. Richard's story is only the last act in the War of the Roses which had been going on for year and years. Sharon Kay Penman is a wonderful writer who breathes life into her characters and makes them seem real. I felt as if I was transported back in time to another century to live among characters I came to really care about. In fact, I admit I fell in love with Richard and even though I knew the final outcome of the book, I still grieved when he died so unfairly.
B001CDLATE|5.0|The best 97 minute cinematic experience of my life. I'm 35 and consider myself a tad more than an HD \\"enthusiast\\".    It's a true sight and sound spectacle.

B001H5X7KC|5.0|I found myself laughing out loud throughout the entire movie. In fact, when I think about some of the things Tom Cruise did in the movie, I still laugh out loud; a week later! It's just that funny. There are a few gross scenes, otherwise it's not offensive at all.     I highly recommend this to anyone who likes comedies. This is by far, the funniest movie of the year, perhaps the last 5 years.
B000P0J02E|5.0|The first movie had an innovative and fun soundtrack with some unforgettable themes, and I'd have expected the third movie to stick with the old standards. But for this one, they whip out a few of the most potent new melodies I've ever heard. These are made prominent in the movie, though still seamlessly woven into the old ideas.     I keep this CD in my car, and will never tire of it. It is unbelievably bold and aggressive, though many moments, particularly some in the Maelstrom track (\\"I don't think now is the best time\\"), could be taken out of context as bits of a complex and brilliant symphony.     This last score establishes the POTC trilogy as having more deep, effective and thrilling music than any other movie. I'm still looking for a better soundtrack; I haven't found one yet.

0312427999|2.0|I listened to Naomi Klein on a podcast where she was giving a speech, as I recall, to folks gathered at the University of Chicago.  Her presentation was well-organized, intriguing, and invited further exploration.  So I purchased the book to explore the subject further.<br /><br />This is one of those situations where more argues for less -- less detail if non-economists are to follow the labyrinth of public facts and private assumptions, fewer allegations unsupported by research footnotes, and smaller conspiratorial webs.<br /><br />The Shock Doctrine reminds me of literature generated by Populists during the turn of the nineteenth century.  In place of the wounded yeoman farmer, Naomi Klein introduces us to supporters of \\"pink\\" economies who succumb to conspiracies engineered by the Chicago Boys and the Berkeley Mafia, all of whom are disciples of Doctor Shock, Milton Friedman.<br /><br />Naomi gives a small elite much more credit than they are due and, if true on some key points, raises more doubts in my mind about the competence of journalism and the \\"loyal opposition\\" during much of the time chronicled in this deeply disappointing book.
076790382X|4.0|A collection of essays on Bryson's experiences and views of America, sometimes annoyingly pretentious and pedantic (especially in the beginning), but more often clever, funny, and perfectly balanced between critical and appreciative of American culture. For me, part of the thrill is that Bryson is a local writer. Great, though slightly dated, but beautiful and humorous and original collection chronicling nature, American commercialism, American communities, and American personality and nostalgia. Grade: A-
1400082773|5.0|What a candid and inspirational book !    No doubt there's little I can say that hasn't already been said, but I simply wanted to note that as a WASP and a somewhat cynical boomer, I rarely tear up, but I was frequently moved to tears by this insightful book.    Obama's life path was very different, and much more challenging than mine.  Although I already intellectually knew that before reading this book, it impacted me emotionally; perhaps because I never knew my real father.    That a work with this depth and insight was written by a man in his mid-20s is even more amazing, and telling.    Read it, but bring Kleenex.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|I watched this originally on HBO and was once again blown away by their ability to make a quality product.  Jarring, thought provoking and touching this is a series to not be missed.
0385340990|3.0|I bought this book because of the reviews, and don't get me wrong, it's a pleasant way to pass a few hours. The superlatives for this book, however, seem misplaced.<br /><br />The book reminds me somehow of the Girls' Annuals of the 1950s, which I read 20 or 30 years later; perhaps it's the can-do spirit of the people of the United Kingdom that allowed them to win the war, which percolates through both. Perhaps not many people remember them.<br /><br />This book is cleverly written in an epistolary form. Some may think that such detailed letters were commonplace 60 years ago, but they weren't. It comes as a surprise when Juliet sends a telegram to one of her correspondents because she cannot wait for the next letter to find out the story.<br /><br />Too many people are stereotypes, particularly the impetuous heroine with a ticking biological clock, the strong but silent hero, the good German, and the intolerant churchgoer. How many people did not know how the book was going to end? It is a facile country versus city and salt of the earth Guernseyman versus slick American tale.<br /><br />The relationships are not well explored. Other books have done a much better job of describing how one can so easily fall in love with a child not one's own. It comes as a surprise here, and makes me think Juliet would have fallen in love with any child. Her overinvolvement in this society, too, comes as a surprise. She is a woman bored with London and in search of a cause.<br /><br />I don't regret the AU$20 I spent on this, but it is not the most delightful or the most charming book I have ever read. The style and subject of this book are a sign of the age of the author. It is so sad that she did not live to see her book top the charts, and it is a reminder to us that the elderly have stories, and we should hear them before it is too late.<br /><br />The rave reviews seem to indicate that most people have forgotten contemporary stories of the war and occupations. I wouldn't rush to buy it again,but it is a good holiday read.

B000W4HJ44|3.0|I really enjoyed the movie and Michelle Phiffer was just amazing (as always), however, I first experienced Hairspray in the stage version and fell in love with the story, the energy and the songs. The movie not only cut two of my favorite songs from the stage version (Momma I'm a Big Girl Now and Big Doll House) but changes some other scenes and really changed Edna's character. I was disappointed with Edna in general, really I don't think John Travolta was right for the roll. Enda is meant to be a man dresses as a woman, it should be obvious with a deep raspy voice. In the film however, aside of the fact that it's John Travolta, you wouldn't necessarily know it's a man and that part of the humor of the character and that was lost in film.    All in all I love the movie as a movie, but if you like the stage version you may be disappointed with this film.
B001CTA1RK|4.0|While it would be no great feat to best its predecessor, Transporter 3 so efficiently surpasses it in every way that this third outing comes across as a far better movie than it actually is.  But for those saddened by the lackluster turn the franchise took in its second installment, the third brings Frank Martin back to his outlandish (but not completely ridiculous) brand of martial arts mayhem, crazy femmes, and 200 miles-per-hour car chases.<br /><br />Frank Martin (Jason Statham) returns to his life of strict rules and transporting dangerous goods, but this time out his mission isn't voluntary.  When Frank turns down a job from the mysterious Mr. Johnson (Robert Knepper), he's unwittingly drawn back in when his replacement winds up dead.  Forced to escort the kidnapped daughter of a high-ranking Ukrainian official from Marseilles to Odessa on the Black Sea, Frank must contend with Johnson's brutish thugs, the police, and government agents, as well as the advances from his rather aggressive passenger (Natalya Rudakova).<br /><br />The familiar circle fights return in the third theatrical adventure of Frank Martin, again choreographed by martial artist Cory Yuen. The directors, writers, and other creative positions may change, but the familiar fight sequences in which Statham is slowly surrounded by a squad of angry thugs remains unaltered.  Even though there is little to believe about the martial arts sequences, it seems that the overly outlandish (though creative) setups in the first two episodes are absent, infusing the most miniscule hint of reality back into an idea that dwelled foremost on \\"cool\\" over sensible.<br /><br />When his initially uncooperative passenger finally decides to speak, she explains she's a realist. The irony couldn't be thicker as every action surrounding Frank is canvassed with a layer of disbelief, over-the-top divinity and utter immortality. Following the pattern of the later Arnold Schwarzenegger movies and the earlier Steven Seagal films in which audiences never have to worry about the amount of damage the hero will sustain (usually nothing), Transporter 3 doesn't allow a moment to worry about the affliction-immune Martin. And as a mindless adventure film it works better that way, keeping the tone light and contrasting Frank's absolute seriousness while the most ridiculous crises roil around him.<br /><br />While the plot is still evil conspiracy silliness, the girl is practically insane, and Frank's uncanny ability to lose his shirt in every fight hasn't disappeared, Transporter 3 surprisingly learns from its predecessors' major mistakes.  The music is more fun, the villain is actually villainous, the one-liners won't make you cringe, and the action remains creative without breaching the line of lunacy.  Transporter 3 isn't the greatest action movie ever made, but after the atrocious results of Frank's second adventure, it's still mighty impressive.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinss never have to worry about the amount of damage the hero will sustain (usually nothing), Transporter 3 doesn't allow a moment to worry about the affliction-immune Martin.

(He never asks for books) Since he's had it, he has brought it to school to read, he turned off the TV to read (and even turned off the play station) I have not read much of this book, but just the fact he can't put it down, must mean it's funny and kid friendly.
B001C46P2A|3.0|Baz Luhrmann's latest effort manages an epic feel and an extreme runtime, though sadly the former is oftentimes a result of the latter.  Vibrant colors and gorgeous cinematography can't quite balance out the confusion caused from the rotation of genres as the film progresses in and out of action, romance, drama, musical, comedy, and more.  And while not every successful epic need be tragic, the tragedy befalling the protagonists of Australia never quite becomes emotional enough to warrant a very deep audience attachment.<br /><br />When English aristocrat Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) travels to Australia to deal with the selling of an inherited cattle ranch, she discovers a plot to monopolize the beef trade with the military by ruthless cattle baron King Carney (Bryan Brown).  Determined to fight the hostile takeover of her land, Lady Sarah hires the roguish Drover (Hugh Jackman) to help lead 2,000 head of cattle across the unforgiving Australian terrain to the city of Darwin.  But the cattle drive is just the beginning of their adventures as a begrudged stock-man conspires against them and the threat of the war looms imminently over the horizon.<br /><br />In Australia's epic scope, the first half of the film is disgracefully dull. The cinematography is the only thing that stands out amongst the uninspired storyline that borrows heavily from the tones, the characters, and the settings of memorable films like City Slickers, Crocodile Dundee, The Cowboys, and Quigley Down Under.  Drover rescues the unprepared Lady Ashley from all sorts of humor-injected mayhem in the playful mood of Crocodile Dundee and Matthew Quigley, and his own personality is little more than a blend of John Wayne's Wil Andersen with Billy Crystal's Mitch Robbins. The idea of droving cattle with a mismatched, novice crew is ripped straight from the plot of both The Cowboys and City Slickers. The jarring separation between part one and part two of Australia would have made for an appropriate intermission, or two completely disassociated films.<br /><br />While visual brilliance is clearly the film's strong point, its bizarre transitioning between a wide variety of genres creates an oddly style-confused epic.  The film starts almost like a screwball comedy, with fast-talking arguments between the leads and a light-hearted bar-fight introduction for the Drover.  Once the cattle drive begins, we're immersed in exciting action with stampeding herds and a race to the proverbial finish line.  Shortly after, the film heads into the territory of romance as the mismatched duo fall for each other, and then a brief stint in a public service announcement for the mistreatment and segregation of mixed-race children segues into a war film of the bombing of Darwin by the Japanese.<br /><br />Australia does manage a gorgeous look, but underneath that deceptive layer of beauty lies a film not too original and not too compelling.

0132350882|5.0|The software development industry is always maturing. The craft of coding is always advancing.     The book starts with a great manifesto-ish cry for clean code and carries the reader through things to consider. Just reading 2 chapters got me to change the way I code. A book club got started where I work due to this book. It's that good.     This book provides an up-to-date view of what works really well when coding / creating software solutions. This view is supported by a foundation of experience and best practices that have evolved over the years.     What used to be great in the past is now refined and sometimes even backwards of what was once done. In those mind-jarring moments, an explanation is given in the book which really helps one see why they suggest what they do.     The authors clearly have experience which they share in a clear and easy to understand manner.     I highly recommend the book.
B0016QNSFQ|2.0|This is an excruciatingly disappointing little skit, not a film at all, but a kind of pretentious panto. It is all the more disappointing that such enormous talents set to work on this, a shallow engagement, not unlike a work set into motion by the likes of John Cleese and Monty Python. With a tweak here and there, this would indeed take its place in the repertoire of English comedy. As conceived by Jarmen and company, however, it is as humorless as it is trivial. It reminded me of the scenes in Ken Russell's \\"Women in Love,\\" in which Alan Bates, playing a young D.H. Lawrence, gets knocked on the head with a paper weight swing by an enraged Ottoline Morrell, only in that piece actions had purpose and emotions had moment. In Jarmen's hands, Bertrand Russell and Ottoline Morrell talk but they say and do nothing. As for Wittgenstein, well...we see him here as the English, no doubt, saw him, that is, as nothing more than a genius, overbearing and silly. Jarmen is known as a film maker, but here we get nothing more than off-Broadway, low-budget theatricals on film. Incredibly, there is nothing said of the era, nothing made of his background, save for a few gushing comments about his family's wealth, something the filmmaker seems to make much of and to admire. For a director known for being daring, this is a remarkably tame little exercise. Old men who couple with young boys may be having the time of their lives, but one has to be shown more than two shirtless males embracing to be convinced. This entire affair has an embarrassing adolescent quality, something one might expect from public school boys run amok over a summer. Wittgenstein deserves far more than this silly work.
B001E7OO2I|2.0|I'm a big fan of John Legend, I have all his cd's and been to a couple of concerts. The thing that makes him stand out of the crowd is the soul and feel of his music, accompanied by the beautiful piano.<br />I was soooo disappointed to pop this cd in the player and find out that it is just like any regular R&B album in the stores. Nothing special! There are some songs that sound ok, but it the album just lacks the UNIQUENESS that made him such a succes.<br />So instead of Evolver I would like to attach the label 'Devolver'!
0805066691|5.0|This was an incredible book and far better than I honestly anticipated. Each chapter tells of a struggle between one group of Indians and the US government, covering the years between 1860 and 1890. Perhaps the only drawback is the lack of maps, which leads to a lot of confusion. I found it best to print out a copy of this map ([...]) to continually reference whilst reading. If you're so inclined, I also bought a copy of Brown's [[ASIN:0684804417 The American West]], a more general history of the frontier, which includes several maps, including some detailed battle maps.<br /><br />Perhaps what is most unique about this book, and why is has received so much praise, is that it is told from the point of view of the Indians. Months are given seasonal names and American soldiers are referenced by their Indian names. The book is certainly sympathetic to the Indians and of course only chronicles the stories of the Indians who fought to keep their homeland and freedom.<br /><br />For anyone interested in understanding the fall of the American Indian, this is a must-read.
B0011Z3334|5.0|I was given this cd not to long after it first came out. I had a friend from Las Vegas who had been following them for some time and thought I'd like them. I listened to the cd and was amazed. It was awesome to see a strong female lead a band like Paramore. I also saw them live at Warped Tour 07 and they have amazing stage presence. This is the type of band I'd love to work for one day.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|David Cook said he wanted his album to reflect who he is.  He did a great job.  The album is complex both musically and in its lyrics.  It speaks to all segments of David's audience - from cougars to kids - without alienating anyone.  There is so much to each song that you can listen over and over and still hear something different each time.  I know David has an amazing voice with an amazing range, but this album reveals that he has amazing depth as a person and a performer.<br /><br />I have a couple little nitpicky items.  I wish David would ease up on the raspiness of his voice sometimes.  It can so beautiful, clear, and true. Like an actor, when he was on Idol David changed up his voice to suit the song - he sounded so much like Neil Diamond on \\"I'm Alive!\\"  But when singing his own stuff he is just a tad too raspy for my preference.  The other thing I wish he would tone down is the extra noise they put in the studio - I guess that's what some reviewers call \\"over-produced.\\"  I love hearing David sing on TV with his new band, the sound is much purer.<br /><br />I can't wait for David to go on tour, and for his next album.  It would be great if he would do duets - he could sing duets with Andrew, with Michael Johns, with Carly, with Archie, and I would LOVE to hear him sing duets with Kim - I wonder if they sing together much?
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Awesome, Awesome, Awesome is the only word I can think of for this album. I made a vow to myself that based on his performances on AI that I would buy his album without even hearing all the songs and I kept my word and was rewarded. I'm not a big Rock person in the first place but the way he conveys his sound really captured me, and I think many different kinds of music lovers will enjoy the album. I can't even really chose my favorite song I like so many of them that to list them I might as well just put them all. So just get the album you won't be disappointed.
B001HDO4Z6|3.0|I heard Coldplay say in an interview back in July that they'd release a finished version (i.e. with lyrics) of Life in Technicolor, which I couldn't wait for, since that was one of the best songs on the album without lyrics. So buying the EP seemed like a no-brainer because I wanted to hear that one song. When I found out that eight tracks would be on this extended play, I got my hopes up that this could be pretty cool. Here are my thoughts on the disc.<br /><br />(1) \\"Life in Technicolor II\\" lives up to the hype, as far as I'm concerned. They've added lyrics that fit the song's feel, they fit musically, and I really like what they've done with it. I probably would have liked this song more if I hadn't heard the instrumental version first, because it was that good. I'm honestly not sure which version I like more.<br /><br />(2) \\"Postcards from Far Away\\" is a beautiful, light, happy piano solo that invokes images of a leaf blowing on the breeze from one city to another. It is, however, only 48 seconds long, and while it's quite nice, its brevity is disappointing.<br /><br />(3) \\"Glass of Water\\" will surely be a highlight for Coldplay fans. It melds the styles of their last two albums perfectly. Like Viva's tracks, it has a very \\"big\\" feel, building up and exploding with lots of instrumentation and Martin's vocals soaring over it all. Like X&Y, it's relatively upbeat for most of the song and comes down at the end to a minimal lead-out. If you're okay with that kind of thing, you'll love this song.<br /><br />(4) \\"Rainy Day\\" seems to be an experiment... Over a boppy electronic drum/bass beat, some A.D.D. electric guitar, and countless sounds that came from some children's music artist, the verses don't make any sense. The choruses make an attempt at convalescence, using the same strings that are in the Viva's title track, but when Martin starts droning on with: \\"And I love it when you come over to my house / I love it when you come over to my house,\\" this doesn't fit anywhere in the phrasing, or in the music, and it's glaringly obvious how much this sticks out. The whole song just sounds like it's on speed, not able to focus on anything. EP's are a good place to try new things, so it's nice that the band clearly is here, with the piano piece, and whatever they're trying to accomplish here. But like all experiments, sometimes they go wrong...horribly wrong.<br /><br />(5) \\"Prospekt's March\\" is a nice flowing song that may or may not go anywhere. It's built the same of most of their other songs, with a bell-curved shape, slow and quiet, to some kind of climax, back down to slow and quiet again, but the climax isn't an explosion like in \\"Fix You,\\" it's just louder and deeper. Overall, a nice tune. I'm not sure about the key phrase, \\"Don't you wish love could be as simple / as fish swimming 'round in a barrel / when you've got the gun?\\" And then Martin's vocals go up into that octave he loves at the emotional parts, but after talking about fish, I just can't feel it, man. Luckily the depth comes after the next lines, talking about \\"lying in my own separate sky,\\" and how \\"I don't want to die on my own here tonight;\\" anyway, not bad.<br /><br />(6) \\"Lost+\\" is the one with Jay-Z. Okay, this honestly made me chuckle a little bit. Here's what you should know about this \\"remix:\\" Near the end of the second chorus, they've dubbed Jay-Z doing a verse over the original music (where that electric guitar solo is), extending the pre-solo just long enough for him to get his whole rap in. This is all they did, and it's very obvious. Now, I respect that they're broadening their musical scope a bit, but this is such a half-hearted attempt that I can't respect this song.<br /><br />(7) \\"Lovers In Japan (Osaka Sun Mix)\\" is very simply \\"Lovers In Japan / Reign Of Love\\" without \\"Reign of Love.\\" That's all it is, down to the second. When I saw \\"Osaka Sun Mix\\" I was really hoping for some cool remix, but no, it's just the first half of the song on Viva, and, in my opinion, the worse half.<br /><br />(8) \\"Now My Feet Won't Touch The Ground\\" sounds exactly like \\"Kingdom Come\\" without the big build-up. Acoustic, Martin's low voice.<br /><br />I find it interesting that Coldplay has gotten into looping thematic elements in their works. I.E. Viva La Vida (album) began and ended the same way, and here they're beginning (the lyrics in the first track are \\"now my feet won't touch the ground\\") and ending with the same lyrics/ideas. I can see why they'd do this on an album: it really makes the whole thing come to fruition, and begs the listener to listen to it again. I find it strange that they've done it on an EP, but I don't really know what to make of it, maybe they're practicing.<br /><br />Overall, this is an EP, so I can't be too critical; It has its real downers, but it has a couple tracks worth picking up. If I knew what I know now, I would definitely buy the couple tracks I like and steer clear of the relative disasters. I hope I've helped you determine whether or not you'd go for some tracks over others.n't Touch The Ground\\" sounds exactly like \\"Kingdom Come\\" without the big build-up.

B001GQACGO|2.0|Beyonce must be weak from her obvious liposuction which completely changed the shape and size of her body.   (She has NEVER looked better  - since she was not born with the body she has now  - that's for sure!  gone are the huge thighs and hips and the ugliest legs in Hollywood.)   The music is poorly written, weak in performance  -- real boring.   I think she should start being herself instead of her stage person:  Sasha Fierce.   The CD appears totally confused like she is still trying to decide who she is after performing for so many years.

B000001A9P|3.0|Stevie Wonder is one of the most talented artists of all time. I've rarely seen a songwriter with as extensive a songbook as his. Throughout the 70s his touring band was considered one of the best in the business because of its talent and sheer funkiness. Unfortunately, Stevie fell into the same trap many an artist did starting in the late 80s and throughout most of the 90s - he figured that synths were advanced enough to replace his once vaunted horn section.     He was wrong.     As a result, this live recording sounds a bit hollow and dated. And I don't mean dated in a \\"well, it's My Cherie Amore, it's SUPPOSED to be old\\" sort of way. I mean dated in a \\"Arsenio Hall Show house band\\" sort of way. I knew this was recorded in the mid-90s even before I checked the liner notes.     For people who don't notice those sort of things, or who do and don't care or even prefer the synth sound, they won't take issue with this live recording. For those of us who fondly remember his old school performances when he had a four piece horn section, you'll be slightly disappointed. To be sure, it's not TERRIBLE, but the prominence of the 90s instrumentation is a bit distracting, especially on songs that rely on groove and grittiness, like Superstition and I Wish.    But don't take my word for it. To get at what I'm talking about, go to YouTube and look up Stevie Wonder Sesame Street (it'll make sense once you're there). Listen to the version of Superstition that pops up and compare it to the version on this album to get a sense of contrast.    While you're at it, listen to all of the previews. Do you hear a perfectly competent horn section in each of the songs? If yes, then proceed to check out and enjoy your purchase. If no, then listen again and consider carefully before truly deciding.    I'm happy to report, however, that there is not a synthesized horn section to be found on his 2008 live tour. It's easily his best touring band in 30 years. And it's a magical experience becauseof it.
0307269752|5.0|To me, this book is the most unexpected page-turning thriller I've read in some time. I couldn't wait for the next surprise.<br /><br />I was reminded of first reading the early Ian Fleming books about James Bond, feeling like I'd entered a fascinating new world that I never had never dreamed of. But Stieg Larsson's writing is much better than Fleming's and these characters are more nuanced in their unusual characteristics.<br /><br />The book defies normal novel categories. There are such a major story lines about both the hero and heroine that the novel would be more than adequate just developing those ideas. The mystery of a young woman's disappearance is more than adequate to sustain the interest of anyone who likes books about amateur detectives. In the background, there are dark secrets about a not-so-desirable family that would intrigue anyone who likes to read family sagas. What's remarkable is that these threads are very neatly combined so that you get a lot of story for your time, money, and reading pleasure.<br /><br />Investigative journalist Mikael Blomkvist has a problem: He's written something that he can't prove and has been sued for criminal libel. His blunder costs him his savings, his reputation, and his freedom while threatening the survival of his publication. How will he and the magazine recover?<br /><br />Lisbeth Salander wants her freedom and finds it hard to win. Although she's tremendously talented, her past holds secrets that pin her down much as Gulliver was by the tiny ropes of the Lilliputians.<br /><br />Henrik Vanger wants to find out what happened to his grand niece, Harriet Vanger, who disappeared while an accident was being handled near her home. Can he persuade Blomkvist to help him?<br /><br />There has been a search going on for Harriet Vanger for over forty years. What have they been overlooking?<br /><br />What skeletons are hiding in the pro-Nazi closets of the older generation of the Vanger family? How do these skeletons affect the present?<br /><br />You'll probably never meet a more unlikely detection team than Blomkvist and Salander. The unusual chemistry and motivation behind their joint efforts directs the story into many unexpected and interesting directions.<br /><br />Stieg Larsson gives as much attention to his characters and their development as most mystery novelists do to their plots. As a result, you can relate to these characters quite well . . . as though you had already read ten books in which they interacted. He also takes the time to make these characters as unique as real people are, making them more vivid and rewarding to contemplate than the two-dimensional cutouts that serve as \\"characters\\" in most mystery novels.<br /><br />His plot is also very fine: He usually doesn't telegraph what's coming next. People act as unpredictably as they do in real life . . . making the plot messy . . . as real life is messy.<br /><br />I was delighted to learn that although Mr. Larsson has died that there are two more books coming.

0385340990|4.0|This book made me laugh and cry.  The amusing stories about the characters made it bearable to also read about the horrors of the war.

But it turned out to be a quick read for me.
B00005JLKB|5.0|I've watched this series over and over.  If you have the slightest interest in Superman, you don't want to miss this saga.  I will admit, there are a few episodes every season that hiccup the main plot, but the cast of characters makes you angry, sad, and happy.  You owe yourself to give it a try.  Buy the whole series through season 7 and keep watching the tv program.  It won't last forever.
B001GKYBXA|4.0|Quite the opposite. VERY UPLIFTING!  First things first.  I am a very big McCartney fan.  That being said, I am also a realistic fan that says when something smells like, well, garbage!  Driving Rain (in my opinion) was not one of Macca's best.  I have the first two Fireman CD's and I find them pleasant enough but this new CD blew me away.  I am not a fan of the opening track but beginning with track 2 until the end, this is a \\"Psychadelicatessen\\" (thank you Rutles) of sounds and melodies.  Highlights for me are Sun Is Shining, Dance Till We're High, and Highway.  And George Harrison is channeled as well on this CD on Lifelong Passion. But the rest of the songs are all really good and catchy and I am so glad he added vocals to this CD.  I defy anyone to listen to Sing The Changes and NOT admit that it was in their heads for good.  It is THAT catchy!  My only regret is that this was put out under the name of The Fireman and not McCartney because it is better than a lot of his solo CD's and some people may not know who The Fireman is and will miss an opportunity to hear a master at work!  I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because there are a couple of \\"less good\\" traks but overall it is a very strong CD.
B001GSV3EC|5.0|Steve Lukather after watching Jeff in concert stated, \\"GOD plays guitar with Jeff Beck's hands!\\" This LIVE CD proves that statement.

BUY THIS CD! You will not be disappointed!!!

B00005JOFQ|4.0|I read the short story before watching the film  Both are excellent and both stand on their own as original works of art.<br /><br />Everyone knows all that has been said. You either understand its message and like it, think it's okay but not outstanding, or are totally turned off. Opinion and diversity makes the world what it is and Brokeback Mountain shows us another part of the world that many people still, unfortunately, want kept in the closet.<br /><br />Annie Proulx's purpose was to expose homophobia in that time and place. Heath Ledger did an excellent job of internalizing his character's homophobia. Only those who have been there can truly appreciate the depth presented here.<br /><br />Homophobia destroys not only the person who is homophobic but all those around them, family, friends, and as so brilliantly and vividly portrayed by Jake Gyllenhaal, their lovers too.<br /><br />This movie gained wider appeal also due to its message of unrequited love. Anyone who has ever experienced lost opportunity for love can identify. An emotionally powerful film.<br /><br />Highly recommended!<br /><br />However, I docked 1 star due to Ang Lee's lame attempt to make this beautiful film more acceptable to a wider audience by cutting out the male nudity that made the film distracting and feel less natural than the short story.<br /><br />Even after that, there was high political motivation for the film's R rating. This fine film should have been rated no higher than PG or PG-13 at most. It's R-rating is a pure political rating with absolutely no basis in fact from the CARA's own rules for ratings.<br /><br />Jake Gyllenhaal did a much better job for an actor in a supporting role than did George Clooney in Syriana. Another AMPAS snuff at a politically controversial film.<br /><br />Those who say that the lack of a Best Film Oscar or Best Supporting Actor Oscar were not due to Hollywood's well-known homophobia are naive or just plain stupid. Well known actors have been in the closet since the birth of Hollywood and continue to influence its peer voting to this very day.<br /><br />I cannot recommend the Special Edition released on Jan 23. It appears to be a case of \\"double-dipping\\" by the production company as there is little, if anything, new on this version. However, also released is the HD version that, for die-hard Brokie fans, will be a pleasure hearing the enhanced HD sound as well as the stunning photography.<br /><br />Regardless of how you feel about the topic, you should not cheat yourself from seeing one of the last great performances of Heath Ledger.peer voting to this very day.

B00005JNS0|5.0|[[ASIN:6305133468 Doc Hollywood]]  Don't get me wrong - I loved the movie!  Animation was great, characters were lovable, etc.  I just couldn't help thinking that it was a re-vamped version of \\"Doc Hollywood\\".  In \\"Doc Hollywood\\", the big-shot doctor(Michael J. Fox) on his way to Beverly Hills to be a plastic surgeon and has a car accident which destroys a fence in a tiny little town in the middle of nowhere.  He's stuck in this town while his Porche is being fixed, and to make up for the damage to the fence, he must help out the town's only physician (an aging guy about to retire) as community service.  In short, he ends up falling in love with the town, the townspeople, and a certain lady.  He ends up going to Beverly Hills to do the plastic surgeon thing, but ultimately misses the town and the girl so much, that he returns to be the town's physician.  Sound familiar?  Yeah, that's what I thought too.
B001GQACGO|2.0|At first, I thought that Beyonce was kind of corny for referring to her alter ego as Sasha, but I must say that Beyonce has created a monster!   I totally agree with some of the other reviews regarding Beyonce's (and her team) horrible idea to stretch out the album onto 2 discs.  The total recording time for both discs is only a little over sixty-two (62) minutes - 62:26 to be exact.  All of these songs plus a few more could have fit on one disc!      I didn't enjoy listening to Disc 1.  With the constant radio play, I'm already tired of \\"If I were a Boy\\" and the other songs are somewhat depressing.  They aren't romantic or sexy at all.  In fact, Beyonce's voice is monotone throughout the entire disc, she doesn't show any versatility at all.  It's like one long cry.    Now, Disc 2 is a different story.  Thank God for producers Bangladesh and Darkchild.  The beats on this disc are sick - Back to back total club bangers.  And Beyonce is just riding the track ever so lovely.  Ignore the repetitive and nonsensical lyrics and just dance the night away!!  Actually, I would probably enjoy the instrumentals of Disc 2 even better.    Finally, Beyonce is a great entertainer but I think she should reveal less of herself  (I AM) and stick to her regular booty shaking tracks that people have loved time and time again.      Originally, I gave this CD two and a half bright and shining stars solely for Ms. Fierce, but I took away half a star for Beyonce's choice to gyp her fans by having a \\"standard\\" cd and a \\"deluxe\\"  edition.   As I mentioned earlier, that was totally unnecessary as all of the songs could fit on one disc.
B00176X7X8|1.0|I cannot believe how awful this transfer is from Synergy Entertainment. Someone actually took a BAD VHS recording and slapped it onto a DVD-R. I just realized after complaining to Amazon's customer service that it is briefly mentioned under the Editorial Review that it is a DVD-R disc that the company made based on \\"demand\\". BS. Had I known this, I could have ordered the OFFICIAL out-of-print DVD for even less than this piece of garbage cost. I am very surprised Amazon is selling such a \\"bootleg-like\\" item.    Until something better comes along, take my advice and buy a used copy of the out-of-print Lion's Gate release. That's what I am going to do. It has to be much better than this.
B00004VXF2|5.0|This album has all my respect for several reasons:  1. It takes a lot of guts to release an album of pure feedback, specially back in the mid 70s.   2. Lester Bangs crab loved it  3. It broke boundries and has been very influential, clearing the way for many other bands  4. It's the noisiest and most annoying album I've ever heard, so credit to the man for that. Plenty other guys try to do the same but just end up being lame. not Lou  Now, I won't discuss wether this is music or not. It might not be, but it's for real. About a year ago I read Fitzgeralds \\"The great Gatsby\\". I flapped the last page. The book had seemed empty to me, phony. After that I needed some real emotions. I put on MMM and it did it for me.   I understand very well that many people hate this (I do get a kick out of the angry 1 star reviews posted here, haha). I myself don't play it that often and never more than one track. But I'm glad I bought it, if only because it comes handy if your housemates, like mine, have the habit of putting REALLY loud dodgy music.   Perhaps 5 stars is going a bit too far, but there are far too many 1 star ratings, so I'm compensating a little
B00127RAJY|5.0|WARNING: THIS DVD IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS...I REPEAT...THIS DVD IS NOT FOR BEGINNERS. For those of you who have been working out for years and you are looking for a challenge this dvd will do.  Each level (there are 3) amounts to about 27min., but you will feel like you have been working out for an hour.  While you're actually doing it you feel like \\"This is so Hard\\", but by the end you feel great, you feel like you have acomplished something.  For the record, all of Jillian's DVDs are great challenges!!!
0375826726|2.0|I dont need to state what most people allready have that the first 600 pages were boring and there was no real plot or climax to this book. Paiolini could have done alot better at this one. The first two books were much better but it was a boring read.
B0009IW88A|5.0|Awesome. The track titles are too cool. Hans is the mans! Kind of dark for everyday listening,but great \\"I'm on a mission\\" driving music. The price on this one spikes so be careful.
B001KQICHG|5.0|Every one of the prime albums of Genesis available not just as a box set, but as a downloadable box set with ten extra rarities? Phenomenal! I will readily admit that I have not heard this particular issue, this review is based upon familiarity with the original albums. For those who savor the years when Genesis featured Peter Gabriel on lead vocals, yes, this might be the holy grail.<br /><br />The compilers judiciously excised two albums from consideration, those of interest only to completists - Genesis Live and the primordial efforts of \\"From Genesis to Revelation\\". These are available elsewhere to those for whom every scrap of recording tape is a precious legacy. My friend bought both of those back in the day and having heard his purchases, I was grateful that I dodged those bullets that afflict completists.<br /><br />For the rest of us, this summarizes the entire Genesis+Peter Gabriel canon, all five albums complete. Trespass, Nursery Cryme, Foxtrot, Selling England By The Pound, and The Lamb Lies Down On Broadway. From Trespass the only tracks I'd need are \\"Dusk\\" and \\"Stagnation\\", but the other four of these five albums are indeed a holy grail of 70s prog-rock.<br /><br />I would anticipate that to some degree this box set would be \\"selling to the choir\\", those of us who relished the original albums as they came out, but for those newly delving into the classic era of Genesis, you'll find that Nursery Cryme and Foxtrot are both strong, and the final two albums of the set, Selling England by the Pound and The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway will become two of your ten favorite prog albums. This is a great way to scoop up the entire legacy at once. I hope that those ordering the physical CD set find that the box set pays due respect to the Genesis legacy for the additional cost of physical media.<br /><br />One added note - don't assume that separation rendered irrelevant the careers of either Genesis or Peter Gabriel (or [[ASIN:B000TERHOE Steve Hackett]] when he left two albums later). Listen for yourself via Amazon's song samples but I think you'll find that any of [[ASIN:B0043XUXS4 Peter Gabriel's]] first four albums are well worth your time, as were the next two Genesis albums, [[ASIN:B00122PUS2 A Trick Of The Tail]] and [[ASIN:B00122TDAS Wind & Wuthering]].eft two albums later). Listen for yourself via Amazon's song samples but I think you'll find that any of [[ASIN:B0043XUXS4 Peter Gabriel's]] first four albums are well worth your time, as were the next two Genesis albums, [[ASIN:B00122PUS2 A Trick Of The Tail]] and [[ASIN:B00122TDAS Wind & Wuthering]].
B001FBSMW6|3.0|Keane's new CD \\"Symmetry\\" takes the band in a slightly different direction from their previous discs. The beautiful melodies, melancholy atmosphere, and beautiful piano of their earlier CD's are replaced on Symmetry by an 80's-type sound with new wave synthesizers and a more peppy, upbeat feel. The CD really takes me back to MTV of the early 80's. After several listens I can say that I like \\"Symmetry\\", especially because it's always such a pleasure to hear Tom Chaplin sing. But fans of the band's earlier music might struggle to connect with the new style. I like it but I hope it's temporary and they return to their previous sound on the next disc.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|\\"Dance Til We're High\\" alone makes this album worthwhile. It's one of the most beautiful melodies Paul, who is by far the greatest songwriter of his generation, has ever written. I am not a huge fan of \\"Nothing Too Much Just Out Of Sight\\" but am amazed by the vocals of someone who is 67 years of age. \\"Sing The Changes\\" and \\"Sun Is Shining\\" show Paul at his pop best.
B000B7BRMM|5.0|Diana Krall's Christmas CD is one of the best Christmas CD'S I have ever had the pleasure of hearing. Diana sings the traditional songs in a soft yet forceful voice that will have you believing your hearing old favorites like \\" I'll Be Home For Christmas \\" , \\" The Christmas Song \\" and \\" White Christmas \\" for the first time . My favorite \\" Christmas Time Is Here \\" from A Charlie Brown Christmas is beautifully done. I recommend you get that certian someone, A glass of your favorite beverage, sit by a fire and listen to This Christmas CD and toast Diana Krall, you will not be disappointed - Mike Pittaro

0143034901|5.0|So it was recommended to me by my fiancee who loved the book so I figured I'd give it a try.  It turns out this is probably one of the 5 best novels I've ever read.  It's simply an incredible book with beautiful writing, amazingly crafted story and just so F-ing good that it had me cracked out each night for 3 days while I tried to put it down.  It's on par with Victor Hugo, Garcia Marquez, etc. and some of the finest writing ever.  It's hard to describe but it's about as intense a novel as you'll read.<br /><br />I'm not going to give the story away, but go get the book.  If you're looking for a masterpiece, this is it.  This book is going to be an instant legend.  It's his first novel and I can't imagine how Zafon can follow it up.
B001F7MSG6|1.0|What a HUGE diappointment.  Del Toro took the characters that we fell in love with, in the original Hellboy, and made them each drink a pot of coffee and take a bottle of No-Doze thinking it was going to give us more of what we wanted.  So wrong. There were certain scenes that looked like ripoffs from \\"Lord Of The Rings\\", \\"Never Ending Story\\" and even a Star Wars Mos Eisley Cantina bar scene thrown in for good measure.  One cheesey scene after another.  I haven't been this disappointed in a sequel since Highlander II when Russell Mulcahy turned our lovable earth bound immortals into whacko aliens from planet Zorg.  Don't waste your money on this one, wait for it on TV - then watch something else.
B000UBMWG4|2.0|It is amazing that so many people voted for this film, so overwhelming that I thought it must be given a try.  If only judging from the cover design and the year it was taken, I would never buy it.  It turned out to be so boring and dull after about 10 mins of starting.     The director was successful in making a good start, but failed to make a good development and entangled in slow paced acting & dialogue in dark & disgusting environment and so on.      To rent before buying is my advice.
0385340990|5.0|One of the best books I've read in quite some time. I found myself so drawn into the story, so in love with the people, the setting, the time period.  Even with all the heartache (keep a tissue box handy) you'll find you love so many of the characters, cheering them on, while hating others because of their own spiteful and selfish natures.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|First and foremost...THIS IS AN ACTION FILM!!! You may find some hidden depth to it, you may feel a little pumped up and ready to take on the world by the end of it, but it is an action film. Compared to the disaster that was Shoot 'Em Up, this film should be up for Oscar nominations for best script, acting, and effects. It is eye candy, but that doesn't mean its not worth your time. If you're looking to watch a movie that will take you out of your everyday routine for a couple of hours then watch and enjoy. Yes, this movie is not kid friendly, but hollywood makes action flics for kids. This is grown up time.  For the comic fans, I'm right there with you in wishing they stayed more faithful to the comic, but there is no way it would have made it to the big screen, and it would probably have gotten an NC-17 rating anyway. Take the movie for what it is, something that may have been inspired by the comic but not derived of the comic. All that said, it was one of the most enjoyable movie viewings I've had in many a year. If you can't just let go and enjoy then go watch Die Hard or something like that, but if you want fluff and pretty people doing fun stuff with guns, and rooting for the underdog, then sit back with your bag of nuked popcorn and enjoy.
0553381687|5.0|I have been reading SF since the 60's, and have been a fan of Martin's for many years.  His Ice and Fire series is the best stuff written since Dune, in my opinion.  This book, volume one, is truly great.  Book two is very good, book three is the best so far in the series, and book four is a huge disappointment.  Hopefully book five due sometime in 2009 will recapture the greatness of the first three books.  This most recent purchase from Amazon is a gift for a nephew.  Hopefully he will enjoy this superb storyteller, too.
B00005JLWN|2.0|My teenage son brought this movie from the library.<br /><br />Judging from the cover, I was concerned that this would be a low-budget rip-off of the Matrix. (As an aside, some reviewers have protested the comparisons to Matrix. Please. Just compare the jacket covers.)<br /><br />It wasn't a blatant rip-off. It wasn't as bad as I thought it would be. But it wasn't nearly as good as it could have been.<br /><br />To his credit, Christian Bale had some interesting scenes. IMHO, Sean Bean was wasted in this movie. The 'Gun Kata' was, as several other reviewers have pointed out, simply silly. Intriguing notion, but silly execution (if one will pardon the pun).<br /><br />I found myself in agreement with most of the other two star reviews, especially Gautner's.<br /><br />This is a B-level movie that had potential. Unfortunately, it missed.<br /><br />Tim Warneka, author<br /><br />[[ASIN:0976862700 Leading People the Black Belt Way: Conquering the Five Core Problems Facing Leaders Today]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0976862743 The Way of Leading People: Unlocking Your Integral Leadership Skills with the Tao Te Ching]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0976862778 Healing Katrina: Volunteering in Post-Hurricane Mississippi]]<br /><br />[[ASIN:0976862794 Black Belt Leader, Peaceful Leader: An Introduction to Catholic Servant Leadership]]
B000FCKC4C|5.0|It is really an inspiring book. This happens to all people, what is the real desire in our heart, how we can follow the inner voice in the heart. The author has used a shepherd boy to show us how we could live our life, it is always a matter of thought, of how we relate to the people we met.  The author also shows how God works in our lives. I think it is really true in the way he told us!
B000P12LWY|5.0|I couldn't stop watching the show on showtime and was so excited when I was able to purchase the complete season. I loved the second season just as much as the first and can't wait to buy that either.
6304479689|4.0|This documentary shows Elvis as he starts to go down a destructive path. You can sense in certain scenes that his health is in decline. It gives a \\"behind the scenes\\" feel as to what life on tour with Elvis was like. He sings great and looks cool as only he can.
B000000HHE|5.0|Since nobody has mentioned it, this album is probably the only classic hip hop album with a title taken from the lyrics of a Johnny Cash song.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />This speaks to the sense of humor, play, and eclecticism that makes this album one of the best I've ever heard in any genre.
B001EVPBY4|5.0|Cadmus & Hermione, Lully and Quinault's first collaboration is given extraordinary treatment in this glorious, historically precise production led from the podium by the remarkable young French conductor, Vincente Dumestre with mise en scene by Benjamin Lazar.  The idea behind this production, a result of the overwhelming reception that greeted their \\"Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme\\" two years ago, was to recreate, as exact as possible, the spectacle as it would have been seen in Paris's Jeu de Bequet in 1673, with all stage lighting provided solely by candles, replicas of the stage machinery, costumes, body language, pronunciation and dance.  The result is a triumph both musically and visually.  The sort of experience that few will ever have a chance to enjoy first hand.  There are times when you feel that what you are witnessing is a tableau vivant or better yet, a baroque painting that has sprung to life. The all-French cast could hardly be improved upon, with sublime singing from everyone involved.  Needless to state that Dumestre's own band, Le Poeme Harmonique is sheer perfection.  Period sensibilities definitely extend beyond just the visual.  This appealed to me from both a musical and historical perspective and if you, like me, are fond of the French baroque, this is an absolute must have.  Gorgeous from beginning to end.   For a brief glimpse, please visit cadmus.fr.

0316017922|3.0|About: Gladwell proposes that self-made success stories are a myth and that outliers - people who do things out of the ordinary are produced by other means besides just talent. By examining hockey players' birthdays, Bill Gates' early experiences, Chris Langan, whose IQ is 195 (Gladwell notes that IQs over 120, don't mean much in terms of success, smart enough is smart enough as intellect and achievement are not highly correlated), Jews in the garment industry in the 1930s, feuds in the southern U.S., Korean airplane crashes, a school for low-income kids and even his own parents, Gladwell posits that success is a product of predictable means. These things that lead to success are: practice (he notes it takes at least 10,000 hours of practice to become a master at something), timing (what time / era you were born), opportunity (If Bill Gates didn't have access to a computer when he was young, he probably wouldn't be the guy we know today) and cultural legacies (Asians might be good at math because their forebears value hard work and persistence gleaned from working in rice paddies).    Pros: Well-written, quick read, interesting.    Cons: Some may disagree with his definition that success equals achievement, as I bet some humble, modest folks consider themselves successful. No in-text citations. Cites Wikipedia in the notes at the end. Did he really need to profile his own parents and grandparents to support his point? His conclusion that hard work + opportunity + timing + what traits and ideals have been passed down to you = success, is not really a shocking theory.
B001GQACGO|3.0|C'mon, what is she thinking? Why split this into two CDs when it could have easily fit on one? So she has an alter ego. That accounts for the sassy, danceable, hip-hoppish vibe of the \\"Sasha Fierce\\" cd, and the Beyonce cd is more top 40, poppy, with ballads? Uhh excuse me, but don't all of her albums alternate between pop, r&b, and ballads? This amounts to nothing more than a gimmick. And the \\"Sasha\\" side just sounds like noise. \\"Single Ladies\\" sounds like \\"Crazy In Love\\" part 2,(I don't like and I wish she'd put a sock in it!) All the rest (Radio, Diva) are hard to tell apart. The lone exception is \\"Sweet Dreams\\", which is more dance oriented than the rest of the album. The Beyonce cd does have some nice ballads, (Halo and If I Were A Boy) so all is not lost with this CD. But who would have thought that ex-Destiny Child member, Michelle Williams would put out the better album this year? Just sayin....
B001E95ZNI|5.0|From a true western fan, I felt the writing in this movie was great. The actors were awesome. Ed Harris and Viggo Mortensen need to make more westerns. I felt their acting was as good as most in \\"Lonesome Dove\\" and that is THE classic western to be compared to. One of the best things about this movie, it is realistic and the props were exact for the time period. If you're in to the Hollywood hype, bogus explosions and new fangled slang this won't be a movie for you. The cast delivers the witty lines with perfection. Viggo's character armed with the eight gauge double barrel shotgun was brilliant. This will go down as a classic !
B000F39M9W|5.0|The first thing that came into my head about this recording was the sound quality. The most significant part of me that liked this recording was the fact that the base (esp. when the percussion play) blew apart one of my headphones. Whenever the base drum comes in, instead of a loud thump, you'd hear a loud BLAM!!!!! Hope you enjoy, and sorry I'm not that helpful at the moment.
B000WTNCYA|5.0|All I need say about this album is, if you love a soothing, sultry voice and are looking for something a little bit different and unpredictable, this is the album for you. My two top tracks are the title track and 'Love me like a river does', which never fails to get those goosebumps going.
B001KPK6Q2|5.0|Alright, first of all, this is Karen's daughter. I LOVE this album so much. This is my plsy-by-play:    1.Fearless (10/10)   Very cute.    2.Fifteen (8/10)  Relatable... but it drags on and on forever.    3.Love Story (7/10)  Too themed, and WAY too overplayed.    4.Hey Steven (10/10)  This song just goes to show you don't need anything really crazy to have a great song. Bravo!    5.White Horse (10/10)  Amazing. It's just Taylor coming back down to Earth and realizing that life isn't a fairy tale.    6.You Belong With Me (10/10)  \\"She wears short skirts,  I wear T-Shirts.\\"  I can relate!    7.Breathe (7/10)  Doesn't Colbie Caliet sing back-up in this song?  WHY?!?!  Good gosh, I hate Colbie.    8.Tell Me Why (8/10)   Just O.K., it's pretty average.    9.You're Not Sorry (10/10)  Beautiful song. It's almost like her song \\"You Don't Have To\\".    10.The Way I Loved You (10/10)  Great Song. One of my personal favorites.    11.Forever and Always (10/10)  Hmmm... Who could this be about? JOE JONAS maybe?  I think she went a little overboard with that whole situation. So I'm Team Joe, all the way.     12.The Best Day (7/10)  Too mushy for my taste.    13.Change (8/10)  This doesn't seem very \\"Taylor Swift\\"-ish, but good, I guess.    Average:almost 8.45    Best Songs:  Hey Steven  The Way I Loved You  Fearless  Forever and Always  White Horse  You're Not Sorry    There you go.  Adios.
0312944926|4.0|I enjoyed this book and it was not horrible, but not great either.    It starts off well enough and I liked the concept of how the story develops, namely trying to stop a computer virus from wrecking havoc and the intrigue surrounding it.    And for the most part the first part of the book was very strong and entertaining.  None of the technical aspects or character actions were something that made me lose interest, but it did start slowing down somewhat towards the later third of the book or so, though there was enough elements to keep me interested in how it was going to work out.  Some things were a little overboard, and without playing spoiler, the sequence in the main computer area and offices around it when people start getting a little more revealed about who is who, well it did fall apart a bit there for me.    It is far from perfect, and Brown's other books were better and more consistently gripping, but this one is still a good one to read on a airplane and I think it is and I think it is worth 3-1/2 to 4 stars because the pros outweigh the cons.
0316017922|5.0|An easy read providing a wide ranging overview of life patterns which have fostered success (or dysfunction) by integrating subjects as diverse as sports achievment, airline safety, rice farming, IQ and college admissions, childhood learning, language and numbers.  Economic, cultural, and family origins are combined into a historic timeline of immigration to illustrate how historic circumstance has dominated the development of cultural groups and individuals.  Critiques of a lack of originality, or of Wikipedia as a reference, seemingly wanted the book to be something else.  Is is quite simply a world view of how cultural markers influence our learning and talents.  Perhaps randomly, it is the confluence of culture, learning, time, and circumstance which play a key role in the life patterns of many 'successful' people.  The book isn't about success or cultural judgments, but about understanding the cultural markers people carry.
0425188809|5.0|A man is hiking in a remote area of California when he discovers a dog. As Travis attempts to continue along the path, the dog blocks him. When he tries to \\"outsmart\\" the dog, it seems to be a step ahead of him, refusing to allow him to continue. And then the woods get really quiet. The dog growls. The hair on the back of Travis' neck rises, so does yours. Something very unpleasant is out there, watching, stalking. Thus begins an incredible journey for Travis and the dog (later named \\"Einstein\\" by Travis).  Einstein is one of two genetically engineered products of a secret lab in the California foothills. He was developed for his advanced learning and thinking abilities. The other product was developed for war. And both have escaped from the lab. While the one is hunting Einstein, the dog helps Travis out of his depression and back into life.<br /><br />Watchers is arguably one of Dean Koontz' best works. While it can be viewed strictly as a suspense/thriller, there are a few more facets to this story. In the Einstein/Travis arc, Koontz deals with loyalty, trust, and friendship. As Einstein reveals himself as more than \\"just a dog,\\" Travis connects with him and will do anything to prevent him from returning to the lab or to the government. With the evil product, \\"The Outsider,\\" he adds suspense and fear, and makes a statement about engineered genetics. And using an assassin, who is dispatching high level scientists associated with the lab, he increases the tension as this is an unknown person, stalking Einstein. If I have one complaint, it is that the ending was a little too \\"neat\\" for the build-up. Koontz has written an excellent novel but when some characters intersect at the end, I expected more.<br /><br />Overall, this is a fast, entertaining read and is highly recommended.
B000W04S6U|5.0|The HALO music is mathematical genius on a base-8 scale. The way Marty has induced variations into the orginial themes that we've all known since the first game are truly nothing short of brilliant accomplishment. Nothing bad can be uttered about HALO's music.    My favorite album so far has to be HALO 3. The dynamic range of instruments and their amplitude during crescendoes is just awesome to listen to. The music is epic, very moving and tells a story. I can just picture the game as I hear the music.    I could never get into classical music without hearing this stuff first!    The HALO 3 soundtrack is more of an orchestra type of sound more so than the others before it. HALO 2 soundtrack had a lot of popular rock music in it, as well as techo.    This soundtrack brings a return of many of the strong themes present in HALO and HALO 2, as well as Marty O'donell's talented use of variation, just like a master composer. I can find no fault in this soundtrack. The music is more riveting, more vivid and clear and has a great dynamic range, especially in the vocal choir. The Flood portions of music were truly horrific, while titles like Tribute or Greatest Journey are really touching.    In my opinion, this soundtrack is the epitome in soundtracks. It's what you'd expect to hear in top-budget movies. This represents the culmination of catching themes and beautiful music in a 7+ year long series. My hats off to the sound team at Bungie Studios, and whoever they may have worked with. And a big congrats and thank you to Marty to creating such great music!

1595141979|5.0|It's Rose Hathaway's third year at the Vampire Academy where she is attempting to be normal dhampir. She is in training to become a Guardian for her best friend, Lissa - the last Dragomir princess. But along her training trouble arrises. She is seeing glimpses of people and things that should not be there. She is uncovering lost stories and is finally realizing what it truly means to be \\"Shadow Kissed\\". All the answers she recieved could make her world as she knows it end fatally.<br /><br />Dimitri is her teacher, her mentor and...the love of her life. She'd do anything for him but he is a guardian while she is only a student - their love is forbidden. Rose will have to decide between three people she loves: Lissa, Dimitri or herself.<br /><br />Many people interested in this series have probably read other Vampire novels in the past. Especially since the new \\"Twilight\\" movie came out in theaters there has been a huge Vampire fad going around for adults and teenagers alike. Although \\"Shadow Kiss\\" and the other Vampire Academy novels may remind you of the \\"Twilight\\" series they are very different. Of course you should still enjoy them if you liked the others.<br /><br />The differnces in these books arise in the characterization of Vampires. Richelle Mead has truly changed the definition wonderfully. I'll always love the old, evil blood-sucking ones that kill 24/7 but Ms. Mead's characters will always have a place in my heart. You'll see that they are not all \\"bad guys\\". They are just like ordinary people with differnt thoughts and outlooks on lives. I hope that you enjoy the new Vampires!<br /><br />Personally, I find Richelle Mead to be a very interesting and exciting writer. I honestly have no clue how she gets some of her ideas. The main plot and smaller plots are all quite complex, making you puzzled at what's really happening. Along with her highs in writing, Mead also has her lows. For example: many of her smaller problems were solved much too quickly for my taste. If two of the characters were to get in a fight somebody would say, \\"Please stop.\\" and they'd just say, \\"Okay.\\" I love her writing style but sometimes I believe that those parts were a tad unrealistic.<br /><br />Despite that I believe that \\"Shadow Kiss\\" and all the other Vampire Academy novels are great books to try. I'm sure that you'll be surprised by the ending of this book and I truly hope you like it. The author did it wonderfully!ers were to get in a fight somebody would say, \\"Please stop.\\" and they'd just say, \\"Okay.\\" I love her writing style but sometimes I believe that those parts were a tad unrealistic.

031606792X|5.0|Was this book perfect?  No.  But it was highly enjoyable and a great continuation of the Twilight series.  I understand some of the plot twists that fans didn't like- but I thought they made it interesting and fairly unpredicatable (well, for teen fiction).  We got lots of time with the Cullens, which was fun, met new vampires, and finally *spoiler* got to see what Bella was like as a vampire.  It wasn't the best in the series but I actually liked it better than Eclipse.  Please give us more Bella & Edward Stephenie!
031606792X|5.0|I read \\"breaking dawn\\" before \\"Twilight\\" and \\"New Moon\\". It's the best of the series and the author is absolutely a genius.
B001GKYBXA|4.0|I love this cd! OK, I confess I am a huge Macca fan. I own everything he has ever done and love his music. Just being honest here in my bias!    I gave it 4 stars because, well, it isnt my *favorite* McCartney album (Back to the Egg) or even Ram... but it is interesting and very well done. Paul needs his own separate rating system, because nothing he does is less than everyone else's 4 stars. He has so many classics it is impossible to compare them all. So I won't, and that is tedious anyway. Everyone compares everything he does to Band on the Run... whatever. That was 30 years ago. He has moved on.    So back to Electric Arguments. The catchiest, most obvious \\"hit\\" is \\"Sing the Changes\\". This song is chock full o' melody. Despite its electronic influence, you would pick it out as Paul's anywhere. \\"Highway\\" is a bouncy little rocker. I also love \\"Dance Til We're High\\", a jangly, soaring ballad. The \\"Sun is Shining\\" will burrow itself into your brain and stay there. \\"Lovers in a Dream\\" is very cool--a dance/trance beat that let my mind unwind into it. \\"Travelling Light\\" is delicate and surprising.    I have the first two \\"Firemen\\" cds. and this one is much more of a complete musical experience. Those were more typical trance/dance experiments. This album will keep revealing interesting musical textures every time you listen. BTW, I also like other things Youth has done (especially The Verve's \\"Urban Hymns\\").    Much to like on this cd. Go Paul!
6305127646|3.0|Freed from knowledge of this popular character and left to enjoy THE SAINT on it's own merits, I enjoyed this light escapist spy flick back in the 90s. And not having known previous portrayals of the merceny spy I liked Val Kilmer's turn as I happen to like just about anything he does. Plus I liked Elisabeth Shue. The plot is kinda weak, lacking in logic in the tradition of fantasy action films. Sometimes, for one reason or another, that is annoying and sometimes it isn't. It would be nice if the world had an energy source like cold fusion right now which is what Kilmer's thief is after. Buy it? Can't say I would, but if ya dig spy/thief movies or think Val Kilmer is a talented cat it's at least rental worthy.
0486274268|5.0|this is a great book for any artist, or anyone who wants a better understanding when trying to draw animals.  It gives several different views as well as basic anatomy! I would highly recommend this book.  The only animal i wish it did have would be birds.
B001GKJ2DO|5.0|I went to see this movie with my Mom and sister. Or, maybe I should say they went to see it with me!<br /><br />To begin with, my Mom didn't know it featured ABBA music - and who knew - she doesn't like ABBA! Oops. So, this movie was not her favorite thing. In fact, she left the theater before the great credit performance. One of the best things, IMO.<br /><br />My sister doesn't like musicals. Oops, I did it again. Guess I could have chosen some more likely-to-like-it companions for this theater visit, eh? Well, at least she was a great sport and laughed at herself - and maybe even at parts of the movie!<br /><br />Now, me. I. LOVE. THIS. MOVIE.<br /><br />It is, as my title says, a total cheese-fest. It is. But when you're having so much fun, who CARES?!? It's campy and silly and there's some definite over-acting going on, but so what? It's brilliant. I haven't felt so good leaving a movie theater in a long time - but Mamma Mia put a smile on my face and a bounce in my step, and that my friends is the mark of a great film.<br /><br />The scenery is beautiful (I want to visit Greece!). I think the actors (especially \\"the girls\\" of the movie) had fun doing this, and it shows. Baranski is over the top and the whole thing is just the best. I can't wait for it to be on DVD so I can watch it again and again. I've never before used the term \\"feel-good movie\\", but this one fits the bill.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|This blu ray dvd series of Planet Earth is fantastic.  The colors and video are exceptional, and it's easy to get lost in this for hours.  Anyone can enjoy this series, especially those who really have a respect for animals and for mother nature.  I watched a few hours of this show when it aired on Animal Planet, but seeing it on blu ray is much better.  The quality is amazing.  I would recommend it to anyone interested.
B000F7CMRM|3.0|So it ain't perfect and maybe it's kinda preachy, but it is a sincere attempt to look at a very serious problem and you get the impression they gave it their best shot. Trying to create an accurate depiction of the many realities and complexities of oil politics using the medium of film in which to do it is monumentous task, is it not? Basically SYRIANA's complicated plot is a take on the world's oil addiction the same way the film TRAFFIC deals with America's addiction to drugs. We see the situation multi-perspectively, all those involved shown and connections made between them. SYRIANA is successful I think in giving the sense it's a small, complicated, corrupt world filled with delusions, lies, and violence. Nobody is innocent, and for better or worse, we're all in it together.

B001E75QH0|4.0|As of this May I became an Indiana Jones fan. When I was younger the movies scared me away because of their more gruesome scenes (specifically the opening of the Ark). Since the fourth movie was coming out this year I decided that it was finally time to watch the series... and I had a blast doing so. These are fun, campy movies.     This set is ideal for new fans such as myself or for fans who don't own any of the movies on DVD. You get all four of the movies in a nice-looking box set plus the second disc from the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull Special Edition DVD.     My only complaint would be a lack of special features from the original three films, but that's to be expected with older movies before all these behind-the-scenes features were the norm.     Anyway, if you enjoyed all four of the Indiana Jones movies and would like to own'm then this is exactly what you want.

0679720200|5.0|This book, at first, seems plain.  The simplicity and clarity of the writing is what makes the book unique.  The main character does this and that, describes what is, objectively, and goes about his life.  He is detached, content, accepting, in touch with life as it is and doesn't taint existence with novel interpretations.  Rather, he doesn't interpret anything.  He is never swayed by what he views as pointless, although he does look for reason in what others are passionate about.  He admits that he has considered being less honest to appease others, but decides against doing so.      I read this book because I am interested in existentialism.  I found that it helped me understand the philosophical movement better.  Also, this book has helped me feel that my logic makes sense, and is shared by others after all.      I definitely recommend this book to anyone who values rationality, objectivity, simplicity, and loathes senseless novelty.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|Robert Downey Jr.'s best movie EVER!!!!    Action packed, almost a little to much love story but not to much.    Very thing you would want in a \\"super hero\\" movie      \\"I AM IRON MAN\\"
1416562605|5.0|When \\"The White Tiger\\" won the Man Booker Prize this year more than a few of the world's literati were shocked that this dark horse of a novel triumphed over the work of other, better known writers.  More than a few reviewers questioned whether \\"The White Tiger\\" was worthy of the honor that had been bestowed upon it.  Although I haven't read the other novels that were shortlisted for the prize, so I can't say how it compares, I can say that this is one of the best novels I've read this year.  And I read a lot of novels.<br /><br />Among this novel's many favorable attributes is one that I prize above all others in fiction: honesty.  \\"The White Tiger\\" is unfailingly, brutally honest as it casts a gimlet eye upon Indian society, politics, capitalism, and its characters.  And honesty is, I think, the primary responsibility of a novelist.<br /><br />I won't summarize the novel because many others have already done that and I see no sense in covering familiar ground.  Those who say that the characters are more caricature than flesh and blood humans may be right, but characterization is not the best reason to read \\"The White Tiger.\\"<br /><br />The best reason to read this novel is the insight it will give you into a social, political and economic system that relentlessly seeks to keep the poor in their predetermined places.  Balram Halwai, the main character, comes from a social and economic background so impoverished that when he rises to level of driver for a rich landlord's son, it seems to him a stroke of unbelievable good fortune.  A roach infested room is paradise in a country where entire families live on the sidewalks.  Gradually, however, Balram's eyes begin to open to the realities of the world around him, like the Buddha, he awakens.  But what he does once he is awake is a whole different thing.  Think Manil Suri meets Jim Thompson.<br /><br />This novel has a lot to offer the thoughtful reader: lively writing, trenchant wit, a page-turning story, and a charming, but deadly anti-hero in Balram.  Its shortcomings are minor by comparison.  Congratulations to Aravind Adiga.  I look forward to reading his next novel.ram.  Its shortcomings are minor by comparison.

B000KJU1MS|3.0|I was a Kiss fan in the 70's, so I go way back. The problem I had with this DVD is that it is mostly all concert footage. I like to see documentary type stuff also. Backstage footage, interviews, background, new insights. You get none of that here. A highlight is Gene Simmons appearing on a 70's talk show in full makeup and costume, and a short story about Kiss visiting a Michigan high school in 1975. Other than that, it is mostly just several hours of concert footage. Good DVD, but not great.
B0015L5B1Q|5.0|Crafted by true masters of METAL. This album showcases the songwriting capabilites of Testaments classic lineup with a seasoned outlook of true thrash veterans. Although the cd sounds crisp I highly recommend the double vinyl release. It definitely has more punch than the cd, and better instrument seperation in the stereo field. I had to buy two copies so that I could archive one of them. I will wear them out.         P.S. Welcome back Paul Bostaph, Solid as always.
B001EO2UKO|4.0|Like other reviews, I was underwhelmed by Dido's third album, with the exception of her lead single and a few of the pop-sounding songs. But as I do with all new albums I purchase, I just let it spin for a few days without paying complete attention to it in order to get a true, concrete feel for the music. Thankfully I did, as Safe Trip Home is another Dido classic. Sure, it may be a bit more muted than Life For Rent and No Angel, but the touch of somberness and melancholy makes the music that much richer. Where before I sang along and bobbed my head absently to LFR and NA, the softer tone, which forced me to take a really good listen to the album, raised my awareness of the actual words much greater, and I now savor each morsel of lyric. A true masterpiece in a time where life can be loud, fast-paced and uncertain.<br /><br />Stand-out tracks include: Never Want to Say It's Love; Grafton Street; It Comes and It Goes; Northern Skies; For One Day.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Very well done.  Excellent.  The thing that caught my eye was how they didn't pretty up the sets & people.  It looked hard & dirty.  You could even hear flies and bugs buzzing.
B001KPYNR0|5.0|I had no idea that Enya was about to release another CD.  I was resigned to the habit that it would be probably 2 or 3 more years before we were blessed with another dose of her angelic voice and instrument arrangements.<br /><br />On a lazy November Sunday morning watching the news, I am turned away from the telly when I hear sweet tones pouring from the speakers and think \\"OMG! That sounds like Enya!\\" Lo and behold on my screen was an image of her new CD \\"And Winter Came\\" due to drop on Nov. 11th, 2008.  I was SO excited my eyes started watering!  No, I didn't \\"cry\\".  I was just so happy my eyes watered!<br /><br />Of course I bought it the day it came out! Two Copies!! One for me and one for someone I deeply cherish.  I really hate it when the store puts their bleeding price tag over the sticker on every copy so I never get to see it. Grrrr!!!  What the heck is up with that?!?! Why do they do that?!<br /><br />Observant folk will see the number \\"7\\" in red in the lower left corner. This is her Seventh studio release. Kewel. Nice touch!<br /><br />I waited a week to listen to it because I didn't want that \\"day after Christmas\\" feeling. Sigh.  I'm still enjoying the ride.<br /><br />Upon first listen...we get an opening number of the title track. Instrumental. Quite a lovely tune indeed! Then \\"Journey of The Angels\\". I swear, God has lent the world angel!  When I go to Heaven this is exactly what I anticipate music will be like! A somber song that makes a great lullaby. As does \\"O Come, O Come Emmanuel\\" and her re-re-re-re-re-release of \\"Oiche Chiuin\\" [Chorale]. Not that I'm complaining. I'm not. She just must *really* love that song. How many times has it been released on her other CD5's? I have lost count.<br /><br />\\"White Is In The Winter Night\\" is a bouncy, descriptive song that can easily become a new contemporary standard Christmas Carole. I get the shivers every time I hear the last 3 words of this song!!! By now you've figured out this is a concept album. There is a theme to it. It is a collection of winter and Christmas songs.<br /><br />ALL of the fast songs should be released at the same time as singles like RIGHT NOW because it's very befitting of the season! \\"Trains And Winter Rains\\" is another \\"WOW!\\" song!  The video (as seen on Enya (dot) com) goes well with the song! Great visuals as per usual!  Man! When will there be a collection of all of her videos on one DVD?!<br /><br />\\"Dreams Are More Precious\\"....makes me so happy inside...like a nice warm blanket and a nice hot tea and biscuit on a cold winter night. Exquisite!<br /><br />\\"Last Time By Moonlight\\" is another gem of a song with a landscape of tones and arrangements of a multi-layered sweet cake more juicy than a Tres Leches Biscocho!<br /><br />\\"One Toy Soldier\\" is whimsical, fun and seasonal. A story song with a cadence that one would hope for and furnished with a happy end to the tale!<br /><br />\\"Stars and Midnight Blue\\"....another slice of Tres Leches por favor!<br /><br />\\"The Spirit Of Christmas Past\\"...Yum Hum Yummy!<br /><br />\\"My! My! Time Flies!\\"....Oh-my-gawd!!! Enya's lyrics to this song channels the Beatles! The guitar is very Eric Clapton! A happy go lucky bouncy number that finishes up the *new* material from this collective of Christmas. Is there a clue as to when her next CD will be out in the ending lyric? Let's hope so!<br /><br />Final thoughts.....BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!! True Enya fans....buy that second copy for the car already; you know you're going to!  To the curious consumer... This album will touch your soul and heart (assuming you have either or both) and if you've yet to be put into the spirit of Christmas, this will have you getting there in style!

0061537934|5.0|I was in SEATAC one evening waiting on my redeye flight when I saw this book.  I am a really big pet lover and a racer so I felt like this book was written for me.      This isn't a reinvention of fiction as some of the reviews may have you believe but it is a fantastic story. I usually only read funny books as I am kind of a softie and don't like sad or dramatic books, but I had to read this one.  It is a quick read (I read it in 3 hours and I am a SLOW reader) but I really enjoyed it, it has a great balance and the discussion of Enzo's tv fascination and encyclopedic knowledge of actors is wonderful.    I gave this to my girlfriend to read who is not a racer and even she absolutely loved it.
B001L4NJIO|1.0|Great shows, some say the best of the tour.   But the audio was mastered by a VIP (very incompetent person) and sounds \\"too loud\\", compressed and lacks detail and dynamics.   Volume stays the same all along the concert...sad
B000UJ48O0|4.0|quick shipping. this is a christmas gift so have not viewed yet. looks like everything seller said.
B001LRICM4|5.0|I have been with the Supernatural series since day 1 and I have yet to be disappointed. For those that have been with the show this long or have knowledge of the occult/supernatural, you will see the correlation of things as the plots build upon each other. The writers have done research and though for society sake have to change a few \\"truisms or myths\\" to make acceptable tv viewing for the masses they are really cutting edge close to alot of supernatural beliefs/superstitions and knowledge. A good reason that they play the intros from past seasons before the current show is to set up the correlations. As for the actors,GREAT choices on the Winchester boys--they play well into the whole good boy/bad boy thing being soft and harsh as the plot calls for.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|This is a great spontaneous album that soars like a rocket. Powerful edgy vocals juxtapose against whispers and haunts. With producer Youth, who produced U2, you hear the Bono type vocal right in your face on songs \\"Sing The Changes\\" and the absolutely brilliant uplifting \\"Dance 'Till Your High.\\" You want Rock? \\"Nothing Too Much Just Out Of Site\\" rocks so hard it will split your eardrums (I am not joking that small children should leave the room when playing it).I won't go as far to say it is better than \\"Helter Skelter\\", but I will say with the lyric \\"The last thing to do was try and betray me\\" and a growl at the end Bigfoot would be proud of, it may be a touch more wicked. You be the judge. \\"Highway\\" moves along with a power bass-line that will rock your socks off. \\"Lifelong Passion\\" is a mystical and trippy mid paced ballad, smooth psychedelica done 2008 style. Nothing old sounding on this song. You want some \\"old\\" 60 sounding songs? You have \\"Light From Your Lighthouse\\", a folksy, guitar twangy, toe tapping song, with a gospel chorus. \\"Two Magpies\\" is a quick step back to RAM. His dog had \\"Three Legs.\\" Now you have a couple magpies(birds) to join him.. He throws a a little Wings or 80s sound at you with the bouncy, yet not wimpy at all \\"Sun Is Shining.\\" For fans of the first two Fireman albums Paul will take you on a hippie trip for three consecutive trance flavored songs before the closing song.\\"Don't Stop Running\\" perfectly finishes the album off beginning with haunting spiritual vocals that lead into a manic paced vocal/guitar/drum finish. Though that is the last \\"song\\" on the album, it isn't finished...wink...wink. These songs are not constructed for earth shattering songwriting techniques. They just bulldoze you over and slap you in the face. And for those who say Paul is back. Truth is he never went anywhere. PS By the way the guy who one starred the album wrote the EXACT same review for \\"Chaos & Creation\\" in September 2005. Check it out. He has no merit.Edd

B0013FSL3E|5.0|The creators of Pixar have topped themselves again. This is a light-hearted, warm and loveable movie. The roughed up little robot, Wall-E, has an adorable little personality as he falls in love with the high-tech E.V.E.<br /><br />Human beings have trashed the planet Earth to the extent that they had to evacuate into space. Robots like Wall-E were built to clean up the planet and make it liveable again. Something goes wrong and human beings are forced to spend hundreds of years in space, until a chance encounter between two adorable robots promises to change everything.<br /><br />You will instantly fall in love with the personalities in this film.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B001ED7C58|4.0|I wasn't sure what to expect. Both my husband and I really liked this CD, and felt that the music choices brought the appropriate feel to the movie. It also introduced us to some bands we hadn't heard of before (Paramore and Iron & Wine), which we are really enjoying now.
B000ZLFALI|1.0|I am a die-hard beatles fan and I absolutely hate this movie. The songs chosen are the generic Beatles, none of the true good ones (come on, no A Day in the Life? or Sgt Peppers? or Norwegian Wood? or Back in the USSR? the list goes on and on). They throw in random Beatles songs that don't fit into the plot what-so-ever (Blackbird, Come Together, While My Guitar Gently Weeps just to name a few). Oh, but there are plenty generic Beatles songs: Hey Jude, I Want to Hold Your Hand, Something, All You Need is Love, and the list keeps on going. Don't get me wrong, those are some great songs, but the Beatles defiantly have better songs. If you are not a beatles fan or a somewhat beatles fan, I'm pretty sure you will enjoy this movie. If you are a die-hard, like myself, you will not. All of my other die-hard beatles fans haven't liked it either, but those who aren't will like it. If you truly love the Beatles, don't waste your time or money.

0060567503|5.0|I'm a human resources manager and use this book and CD to help first-time supervisors understand the power of managing people properly.  Not an intimidating, theoretical book that they will never read, but a real world \\"how-to\\" manage people.  It's a great first step as they make their foray into management. Plenty of time for the heavier stuff later in their careers.
B001E1DJD4|4.0|First of all this CD is great. But not as great as her las CD.  I think that when Rachael signed with warner  have to sell more and sacrifice the soul of he music. In the last EP we get a beautiful song that now is not included in this CD. What happened?
B001KQKC0Q|3.0|I was disappointed when I heard recently that Mutt Lange had joined (taken over) Nickelback. These guys have released some of my favorite music - until now. Why does Mutt have to make every band sound like Def Leppard in the 80's. This sounds like what Def Leppard would have been if Chad sang for them instead of Joe Elliott. As much as I loved that then, it's been done. I agree with those that say it's over produced as well. This band is (I hope not \\"was\\") raw - when music sounds more like the guy behind the board than those on the floor it takes away from it. Mutt, you made great music, but get toss the cookie cutter. I want the old Nickelback back.
B0014DZ2VO|3.0|The first sequel in the James Bond canon of films, \\"Quantum of Solace\\", the second Bond film to star Daniel Craig, picks up pretty much where \\"Casino Royale\\" left off.<br /><br />Bond is set on revenge for the death of Vespa, his love. He braves the windy mountain roads in Italy, trying to outrun another car filled with gun wielding villains. When he arrives at a secret headquarters in Sienna, he pops the trunk and removes Mr. Whyte (Jasper Christensen), who was captured at the end of \\"Royale\\". M (Judi Dench) and a few other agents are on hand to interrogate Whyte who simply laughs at them. \\"You really have no idea who we are.\\" Bond is soon chasing a mole through the crowded streets and across the shingle rooftops of Sienna. Then, before you can say, \\"No Mr. Bond, I expect you to die,\\" Bond is off to Haiti to follow a lead. He spots Camille (Olga Kurylenko) who wants to get close to her former lover, Dominic Greene (Mathieu Almaric, \\"The Diving Bell and the Butterfly\\", \\"A Christmas Tale\\") so she can get even closer to General Medrano, the deposed Bolivian dictator who is eager for Greene's help in reinstating him. Camille wants revenge and Bond soon thwarts her plan. But they quickly realize they have similar goals and should work together. Bond soon follows Greene to Austria where he spies on a very secret meeting between Greene and the rest of his group. M begins to lose patience and tries to stop Bond, but he turns to Mathis (Giancarlo Giannini) who is eager to help for a little adventure. In the background, it looks like the CIA is trying to establish a relationship with Greene, despite Felix Leiter's (Jeffrey Wright) misgivings. Then the action moves to Bolivia for an explosive climax in the Bolivian desert.<br /><br />With each stop, Bond learns a little more about Greene and his highly secretive organization. But director Marc Forster (\\"Monster's Ball\\", \\"Finding Neverland\\") working from a script by Paul Haggis (\\"Million Dollar Baby\\", \\"Crash\\"), Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (co-writers of \\"Die Another Day\\", \\"Johnny English\\" and \\"Casino Royale\\") has created a very lean, mean Bond vehicle for Craig to glower his way through.<br /><br />Most Bond films run over two hours and I was shocked to learn \\"Quantum\\" would run about 105 minutes. Interesting. Now, after watching the film, this makes sense. There is a great 'economy' at work in \\"Quantum\\". No, it isn't a cheap film. In fact, it has the largest budget of any Bond film ever. No, the director and writers have created, at times, an almost impressionistic piece of filmmaking. In one scene, we might see Bond arguing with M about the course of action they should take. In the next, we see a quick shot of a new locale, with the city's name superimposed on the screen. Bond is already driving to his next locale. It almost seems like a couple of shots were cut out of most scenes, shots the filmmakers didn't think were necessary. But the absence of some of these moments helps to create a less than smooth story; the flow is off. We need to see Bond and M talk more, we need to see him reveal some of his plan to us, and we need to feel we are a part of the story, too. When we are simply watching Bond travel through a new location, we feel more like a voyeur than a participant in the journey. And this isn't such a great thing. Most people will tell you they love James Bond films because they are exotic and we feel like we are taking the journey with Bond. This<br /><br />The locations are exotic, as always, and the action is fast-paced. In \\"Quantum\\", the action continues to take a harder edge, presenting even more brutal fistfights and car chases. The film opens with Bond trying to outrun a car of gun toting villains following him through the windy roads of the Italian countryside. This is an intense sequence, but it ends too abruptly and doesn't deliver the sort of ah-ha moment we used to get. Remember when Bond skied off a cliff in \\"The Spy Who Loved Me\\" and his parachute revealed the British flag? Don't get me wrong. I like most of the changes they made to Bond's character for the relaunch in \\"Casino Royale\\", but in \\"Quantum\\" they take these changes to an extreme. They want to make Craig a grittier Bond but does that mean he has to get cut, bruised and scraped in every altercation? Director Forster seems to think so.<br /><br />Forster, best known for the films \\"Monster's Ball\\" starring Billy Bob Thornton and Halle Berry and \\"Finding Neverland\\" starring Johnny Depp and Kate Winslet seems an odd choice to helm a Bond film. From small, intimate films to a big budget movie filled with extensive, complicated action sequences. It seems a big jump and I'm not sure about the logic of the choice. There are some nice moments of character development between Bond and M and Bond and Camille. But do these happen because of the director or because of the writers?<br /><br />There is another significant shift in this new Bond film. Bond always tries to stay current, even if he sometimes seems a few years out of sync (given the production time for one of these films, that seems understandable) so in \\"Casino Royale\\", Bond chased a suspect who leaped onto balconies, grabbed walls, bounced off concrete in a technique known as Parkour. This was a major step in bringing the type of action in a Bond film into the current century as well. And it was thrilling to watch. It made the hunt and the fight seem more immediate, more visceral. In \\"Quantum\\", they take that a step further. Clearly recognizing the success of the \\"Bourne\\" trilogy, the filmmakers have adopted a very similar style; a lot of hand held camera work thrusts us into the middle of the fights, giving us larger images of fists connecting with flesh, of teeth getting knocked out. This technique puts us right in the middle of the action. As Bond chases a suspect through the streets of Sienna, they eventually make it to the roof and continue the chase. At one point, Bond and his suspect fall through a glass ceiling and crash through scaffolding erected to restore the interior. As they fall, the camera falls with them, following their trajectory, taking us with Bond. This is a highly successful trick and it was also used in \\"The Bourne Ultimatum\\" when Bourne follows his suspect through the window of a Moroccan building. As Bond falls through the scaffolding erected at the worksite, we fall with him, making us a part of the journey.<br /><br />But this technique is very different from what we are used to in a James Bond film. Bond films take a lot of time and money and much of the fun of watching the newest installment is to see the beautiful, exotic locales or the mind-numbing action choreography. When the action is filmed so close, we aren't able to appreciate the choreography, the skill it takes to make these scenes work. With the exception of the climatic fight between Greene and Bond, all action seems to have been filmed with handheld cameras. It thrusts you into the action, but it would have been nice to see a little variety.<br /><br />There also seems to be an economy of action. \\"Quantum\\" has the largest budget of any James Bond film so you would think they would go over board and make it very over the top. But director Forster seems to take a page from his independent filmmaking background and keeps many scenes small in scale, cutting extraneous bits of dialogue and exposition here and there. For instance, we might see a brief scene between M and Bond and the next scene shows him in a new city, with a title card telling us where he is. What is missing is the bit of dialogue where M tells him to go there and follow the suspect. This is just a general example to give you an idea of what I am talking about. Because we are literally not seeing Bond get into a car, or enter a hotel, or walk someplace, the film seems choppy. And the title cards are necessary because we would be lost with out them.<br /><br />I know it seems strange I am pondering the loss of extraneousbits of dialogue and exposition, but they add a fluidity to the film which makes the Bond films seem more lush, more exciting somehow.<br /><br />In \\"Quantum\\", Bond is out for revenge. Because of this, he is also working 'off the grid' for a significant portion of the film. And because of this, Craig amps the intensity of his portrayal to a new degree. In \\"Casino Royale\\", Craig shows us a grittier Bond, a less refined Bond than we are used to. In \\"Quantum\\", Craig very nearly glowers his way through the entire film. When he falls in bed with a girl, it isn't so much that he is attracted to her, it is that he needs some information and needs some release. From the moment he sets eyes on Greene, we learn a new definition of the term \\"If looks could kill\\". Surely, Greene can't mistake the animosity in Bond's eyes and knows something must be up so why does he even bother having any interaction with him? Bond forces himself upon Greene and his organization. And because Bond seems so hell bent upon revenge, he seems less refined and less dignified. But I guess we probably all would in the same situation.<br /><br />What all of this points to, in my opinion, is a Bond film that almost seems like a Cliff Notes version of another Bond film. I like the changes they have made in the franchise, but in \\"Quantum\\", they take these changes too far.restore the interior.

B000V86OKG|4.0|Although season two is not as good as season one, Dexter remains my favorite. Still abiding his \\"code\\" (Don't kill anyone who doesn't REALLY deserve it), Dexter is now learning that he has feelings after all.    Dexter lives what many of us barely dare to dream, avenge the victims of killers by showing them what they did and then taking the same thing they had taken from their victims before: Their lives.    And he still remains a friendly, sympathetic guy, all the way.    Just... SLAMMIN'!

B000ZOXDFA|5.0|If you enjoy great acting performances, stunning direction and cinematography and more (sets, costumes, etc.) you should be entertained for most of the two hours. The story was pretty interesting, too.     It's tough to beat a foursome like Cate Blanchett, Geoffrey Rush, Clive Owen and Samantha Morton for good acting but - for me,  the star of the film was the photographer. In this case it is Remi Adefarasin. Between his camera-work, the direction of Shekhar Kapur, and the production design by Guy Dyas, this film is a series of pure visual treats.    I'm not one who usually pays much attention to costuming but Queen Elizabeth's attire in this movie is spectacular. A nod to the great costume design efforts of Alexandra Byrne.    Some people complain Elizabeth isn't portrayed as a strong-enough woman in this movie. I'll use a British response for that: \\"rubbish.\\" Not only is she strong, she is shown as human - not some cold-blooded machine, but as someone with feelings like the rest of us. All her emotions - and I mean all - are on display along with inspiring leadership of her country, with the latter's welfare her number one priority.

0930289234|3.0|What would happen if small-time vigilantism and all its collateral damage went universal all at once?  Would those vigilantes approve of the ultimate conclusion to the code they practiced ineffectively, until now; would the people they protect? The complex character histories provide the clues to these answers which the rather abrupt ending completes.  The slightly goofy mad scientist elements aside, this story highlights some interesting ethical conflicts and shows their effects upon a diverse set of characters.<br /><br />I've read several reviews expressing a preference for novels.  However, this graphic novel presents a story in a way a conventional novel never could.  By layering multiple storylines from different places, times, and even other comics, it evokes a sense of time and action unlike most novels and comics I've read.  And for this experience alone, I think it's a good read.
B0013FSL3E|2.0|I know a lot of people apparently like this movie, but I particularly didn't enjoy this. The story just seemed kind of bland to me. The world gets shot to hell and we have to live in space as fat people that can't do anything, and the only hope for our survival is a robot that has a plant. No offense here, but the whole movie seems kind of soulless to me. WALL-E, by the reference of the protagonist, is meant to just clean up trash his whole life for 700 years. What were we doing in space for that long without even bothering to send anything down to earth to investigate the Robot's progress? Why wait that long until you decide \\"Hey, maybe we should check and see how our home is doing?\\" Did it ever occur to anyone that at some point in time, you should have checked sooner before you became gelatinous blobs stuck in floating chairs? To show that I do not hate Disney movies, I have to say that \\"Bolt\\" was a far better movie than this. Disney was able to pull off something amazing without Pixar and I was extremely impressed with the results. Sure \\"WALL-E\\" will probably get into the nomination for \\"Best Animated Feature\\" on the Academy Awards, but it most definitely does not deserve to win. \\"Bolt\\" or \\"Kung Fu Panda\\" deserves to win it. Show the world that Disney and Pixar's tag team is not the only company capable of making award winning movies. Dreamworks and Disney by itself are fully capable.

B001FB4W0W|4.0|The books are always better.  Always.  Yet I feel compelled to watch any movie or show based on a book I liked and usually spend the whole time cringing.  In this case though, the show managed to provide some solid entertainment without mutilating the characters and the story.  There are definitely places where it slips into melodramatic corniness but for the most part its really enjoyable and definitely worth watching.  I'm excited about season two and will be buying this season for dvd.
0307269752|4.0|This book has a really nice pacing and generally a very good style for a mystery novel. There is perhaps too much emphasis on Swedish recent history (at least for those of us not familiar) and plenty of \\"message\\", but that rarely detracts from the story and the pacing of the story.<br />The main focus is clearly on mistreatment of woman in Sweden; but, it is not preachy or anything. My chief issue with it is that it is really pretty gruesome in places. It is hard to put down for the story as it is very engaging, but some of the descriptions are really hard to read. I am not sure that much detail was needed.<br />If you can get past that, the character development of one of the main two characters (Lisbeth) is really amazing - she is Autistic or Asbergers or something (although the author does not say that, the symptoms are well described). The character development of the other main character is not as well developed, but he is more than a cardboard character.<br />The process of the story unfolding is very nicely done with paths colliding. The reader is no farther along than the characters, unlike many mysteries where you get extra clues they do not. This means that you get pulled along with them vs. being apart from them. This works very well in this story.<br />I think it is a great read.
1400079179|4.0|I knew better than to take this book at anything more than what it is: A work of fiction. With that approach, I found it very fun to read. The plot is interesting, the characters are well written and believable, and there is enough back-story to help suspend disbelief.
0312944926|2.0|While I really enjoyed this author's other 3 books, this one was a struggle. For months I read and re-read the first chapters, trying to get past my annoyance of the main characters, especially Susan. Susan is a completely one dimensional character and throughout the entire book, she proceeds to whine about missing her new boyfriend, her worries about him, etc. etc. I genuinely wanted the \\"good\\" characters to not make it out alive, and that's not a good sign.<br />Check out Deception Point instead.
0375826726|3.0|A bit stiff at times, but overall very enjoyable. The politics, intrigue and plot we're well done. The cast of characters are still compelling, well written, and believable. Definitely worth it if you've read the previous entries in the series.

B000VR824S|3.0|Firstly, I thought the MC, Mr.Bill Murray was hugely irritating. Especially as he referred to John McLaughlin as the founder of the \\"Mahi-Mahi\\" Orchestra (!). Funny ? Go figure.     Secondly, the production quality, especially the sound, editing and overall stage aesthetics were not a patch on the earlier Crossroads DVD. It's a big let-down. Also, the `Audio' option does not provide for a 5.1 option, only 2.1 is available.    Coming to John McLaughlin, he plays a rather tepid composition, unlike his electrifying duet with Zakir Hussain on the last show.    Even Buddy guy looked a bit jaded. Was it because he came on at the very end ?    The only bright spot was Jeff Beck and his amazing girl-woman bassist (Tal) who played with the same open-mouthed gleeful enthusiasm as a Ronaldino playing soccer. Both the tunes were crackling and left me craving for more.    All in all, I certainly wouldn't go  goo-goo ga-ga like all others here. 3 stars will do.     If you really want to see great `live' concerts check out `Concert for George' (featuring Clapton) and `Live in Paris' (featuring Miles Davis !).    Thanks you and goodnight.    Ranjiv Ramchandani.
B0002XNSY0|5.0|A very intelligent yet hilarious look at the insanity of war and those responsible for waging it in the nuclear age.  Full of 4 Star performances by Peter Sellers (in multiple roles), Sterling Hayden, George C. Scott and Slim Pickens, the epitome of the commie-fighting cowboy    The behind-the-scenes companion DVD is just as much of a treat as the film itself: the set designers made educated guesses as to the interior of a B-52 bomber, and turned out to be so accurate that the Air Force got concerned and Stanley Kubrick was worried that the FBI would come after him; Peter Sellers was originally set to play the Slim Pickens role in addition to the President, Group Captain Mandrake, and Dr. Strangelove -- but a dispute with Kubrick, Sellers own near-exhaustion from playing 3 other roles, plus an \\"accident\\" all conspired to allow Sellers to bow out as the B-52 commander, and in came Slim Pickens in perhaps the most memorable film role of his career.  Pickens, as Major Kong, upon being told by his radio operator they've just received orders to bomb the Russians in reponse to an attack on the United States, responds: \\"Well I been to one World's Fair, a picnic and a rodeo, and that's the stoopidest thing I ever heard come over a pair of earphones!\\"  Do not miss this classic!
B001FSDOZO|2.0|I was not very impressed with this CD. Out of the 11 tracks I only liked 4! I was not impressed with all the talk about sex.

B0018CWEYY|5.0|Although I liked Season Three, it was a bit slow.  Lost overcame the writers strike with a short fast hitting season with lots of action, plot twists, flash backs and forwards.  You were wondering what was coming next.  And really, who was the guy in the box.....?  Well, you find out the last scene of the last episode.  You learn how Jack degraded in his time back home and you see the progress from a few years back to the present, or just about the present.<br /><br />Setting us up for this season?  What happened to those on the boat, are they alive?  How about the island, where did it go?  So where is the island originally from or part of, my thought recently, Atlantis.  Well you have old statues in places that we saw in previous seasons and the Dharma Initiatives logo looks a little like out of a Jules Verne novel.<br /><br />Anyway, we had three new additions to the show in season four and we got a little closer to what the 'Thing' is.  Still, there are some questions to be answered.  Hopefully season 5 will lead to a season 6.  Lost is still a great show with an incredible cast.

B001GAOY5U|4.0|I am a 3D devotee.  I have sampled the shutter-glass TV technology, and the various 3D available in the movie theaters.   The blu-ray format for Journey uses a red/green anaglyph rather than the more common red/blue.  This may be a matter of taste.  The concept of 3D is used best used to draw the viewer into the action.  This was done well in the movie \\"Spy Kids 3D\\".  There is always the use of \\"coming at you\\" in the 3D which should be used with discretion.   Journey over-uses this concept in a very predictable manner.  Nevertheless, it is used well in the action scenes.
B000O77SRC|5.0|In case you've never seen this one--and it's really a classic, so unless you don't watch action movies at all, you really should see it--Bruce Willis is John McClane, a NYC cop in LA to spend Christmas with his kids and estranged wife. At her office Christmas party in a big office building, he's freshening up in the bathroom when terrorists, led by Alan Rickman's character, take over.    Since hardly anyone knows he's there, it's up to McClane to save the day. Tons of action, a good dose of humor, and even some realistic emotional stuff. This movie doesn't miss a beat.    Most action movies... heck, most movies period... skimp somewhere. They'll focus on the action scenes and neglect the plot, or the emotional stuff will be tacked on as an afterthought, or any one of a number of other complaints. This one doesn't do that. Everything's well balanced and logical and just sucks you right in.    From the walking-on-glass scene that I can never watch (ouch, ouch, ouch) to the good-hearted but not terribly gung-ho beat cop to the dozens of great quotes, there's too much I like about this movie to list it all.    I was impressed with the portrayal of Holly, John's wife (played by Bonnie Bedelia). I don't like her in the beginning, but later on, she shows her character, and you can see what John sees in her. This is highly unusual in action movies--mostly, the women are inexplicable.    And the terrorists. I loved the terrorists. That doesn't sound right. I loved that they were thieves, not ideologues. It was such a great twist, and so very believable. And Alan Rickman does evil so well.    And of course, it's got both Bruce Willis and Alan Rickman from my short list. I'd probably enjoy this even if it wasn't such a good movie.

Fantastic (but don't dare peek or the rest will be ruined).<br /><br />This is a not-so-serious book about falling in love with reading, learning what you can from it, and then getting on with what's next.  If you are a reader, you'll recognize yourself somewhere in this story.  If not, you just might be tempted into reconsidering.  Bennett treats Her Magesty gently but still has a bit of fun at her expense.  The rest of the court...well, they don't fare so well.

B001LMRCP2|4.0|I think my view of this EP would be different if I paid full price for it. At 99 cents, surely anyone who has the slightest afinity for Coldplay can find something to like here.     The EP sounds very much like the \\"Viva\\" album, with the same instrumental, studio, and mixing techniques applied. The exception would be the Jay-Z mix of Lost+, which really doesn't work, as far as I'm concerned.  The harsh rap denudes the song of any elegance it had in Coldplay's hands.     The EP is appropriately titled Prospekt's March, since that is the best song in the collection. It's a somber and appropriately atmospheric piece. It could find a comfortable place over the closing credits of an epic war movie. And it's good enough to have been on Viva La Vida.     Coldplay is trying to stretch out and move in different directions. Not all those experiments will be completely successful. But they want to try, and I'm not going to knock them if they don't hit everything out of the park. Most of the items on this EP are a little weaker than the material on the Viva album, but it's all very listenable, and you can't legitimately call them throwaways, as you could about so many releases by other bands when they recycle and release songs that didn't make the cut for a major album. Even the semi-classical piano interlude, Postcards From Far Away, is a tasty little musical tidbit, perhaps a hint that we will be hearing more ambitious piano work on future Coldplay releases.

B001H9MWW2|5.0|For those who love Coldplay's latest offering, this is a great way to round your Viva experience out with the new EP, especially if you got the original album electronically. While it's not the most red-carpet edition imaginable, it is stylish and quite affordable. For those wondering whether to buy the EP, do so - it's a nearly seamless addition to the inspiration of Viva, with the sole exception of a couple dozen seconds of silly rapping overlaying \\"Lost+\\", unnecessary since it's the same version of the song on the album. Listen to it once.
B000092Q4U|4.0|Back in Summer 2001, nu-metal was the rage.  Yes, there was an interest in bands like Slayer, but that was largely due to them getting exposure from hipsters who were more into fashionable pop-punk than metal.  While going through articles in magazines, in between ads and articles for KoRn, Limp Bizkit, and Kid Rock, I found an article on a little-known band called Lamb of God and what they were doing to make themselves distinct from what was considered metal at the time.  Instead of having all sorts of piercings and multi-colored hair, these were dudes had the more traditional metal look with the long hair and genuine grit.    Well, while their more critically acclaimed New American Gospel came out to little fanfare, when this album was released, all of a sudden the trends started shifting as to what \\"metal\\" was.  The kids who were rushing out to cover \\"Blind\\" stopped and started covering songs like \\"Ruin\\" (Think I'm exaggerating?  I've seen exactly that happen, more than once, and I couldn't make it up if I wanted to.)  This new alternative to nu-metal didn't have to be straight noise and reinforced the idea that both NWOAHM and metalcore could be musical.  Not long after the album was released, the trends shifted, and the kids who were previously listening to bands that had roots in mainstream music (such as Korn, Tool, and Deftones) were now starting to find roots in bands that were a bit more underground, such as At The Gates, Carcass, and other acts associated with grindcore and extreme metal.  Does that mean some of the kids who listen to this aren't necessarily \\"tr00\\" to metal?  Maybe, but there's probably a lot of other kids who got into great metal thanks in part to this band and their efforts.    This CD rocks.  While there isn't a dull moment on this album, the songs \\"Ruin\\", \\"11th Hour\\", \\"A Devil in God's Country\\" and \\"Vigil\\" are what I feel to be the standout tracks on this album.  I recommend this to metal fans, fans of music who understand the need tosing in aggressive tones, and anyone who needs to take a cross-country drive but is allergic to caffeine.
B000HIVOFU|4.0|When I bought this sacd by Chesky recording it really opened my ears.This disc is in two channel only.Not multichannel.But the stereo sound is so real in the room when you hear the vocals from these artists. Very moving and touching when listening. How pure can a stereo sacd can be?I would say that Chesky records did a great job making this two channel format. I would truly recomend this. Theres a true variety of music on this. good jazz vocal,some vocals have good sounding strings in the backround.If any of you audiophile listeners are thinking of listening to different brands of speakers if your at your friends place or buying new ones this is a good disc to  tag along with ,to hear all the different vocals it  gives You. You love good range of vocal acoustics ?than I highly recomend this music.
B000EOTEPO|5.0|Let's start with the drama that happened before this recording.  Abbath and Demonaz found their new drummer Horgh and released Blizzard Beats, which didn't fare as well as the group hoped.  Well, the band regrouped to start working on this album when Demonaz suffered career-ending tendinitis.  With the future of Immortal in doubt, the group forged ahead with Demonaz writing the lyrics, Horgh playing drums, and Abbath having to sing, play guitar, and play bass on the recording.  The recording process was tedious and frustrating.  All and all, Immortal needed to come out with that magnum opus just to stay sane...    ... well, they did it, and this is that album.     You wouldn't think of it due to the 6-track length, but the album is over 45 minutes long.  I can't single out a single track on this album as to which is more superior than the other because the album tells like a story.  \\"Withstand the Fall of Time\\" is the perfect opening track because of how grandiose the opening of the song is; while \\"Years of Silent Sorrow\\" have the perfect ending because it brings down the house just like any live metal show.  Remarkable riffs and some of the most intense drumming put to tape is all found here and everything that's right about metal is demonstrated on this album.  The only way it could be more metal is if it started rusting, but then you couldn't listen to the CD so that's probably a good thing.    I recommend this album to all metal fans and all fans of music.  I also recommend getting the CD as opposed to Amazon/iTunes download because while these guys made one of the best metal albums ever, they also shot some of the most unintentionally hilarious promo photos ever too and those can be found in the liner notes!

Although the book had been previously used, it looks pretty much new, it's in pretty good shape, and it arrived to my door unscratched. I recommend buying through this seller.
B000005GWE|5.0|I picked up this CD used, primarily based on my familiarity with Pat Metheny, and was extremely pleased with my purchase. I'm an unabashed jazz lover, and this one satisfies. I agree with a prior reviewer that the bass could have been emphasized a little more, but overall a great CD.
0385335997|5.0|So much has already been said about this series of books, but I can't help it, I have to add my two cents just in case there are still people out there who have put off reading this series because of the time-travel aspect, (which is why I didn't read them for so long as a big fan of historical fiction). Stop resisting, start at the beginning, go out and pick up a copy of Outlander and I promise you will not stop until you have read all of the books in the series!<br /><br />The first part of Voyager covers the time Jamie and Claire spent apart and we learn what has been going on in Jamie's life. This is the first time we get to go inside Jamie's thoughts and feelings as chunks of the story are told from his point of view. I had to fight so hard not to skip ahead to their reunion, but it was worth the wait. This book has so many twists and turns and I thoroughly enjoyed their adventures in this book. Never a dull moment!<br /><br />One of the things I love best about Ms. Gabaldon's series is the beautifully written dialogue. This book in particular features many excellent scenes involving heartfelt conversations between Claire and Jamie, and their words to each other are always so true, so real, their voices are always consistent.<br /><br />Outlander is still my favorite in the series, because I love reading about the beginning of their relationship, the trials they go through and watching their feelings for each other develop, but Dragonfly in Amber and Voyager are both wonderful, too. All of the books in the series are excellent, but the first three are the best.
B001ED7C58|5.0|When I first recieved this soundtrack I was a little dissappointed. I could only picture a few songs going well with the movie. But, after listening to it a few times few it really grow on me. I now love it! I listen to it everyday and the music goes so well with the film. Also, I liked that it had bands that are not so well known like Mutemath and Collective Soul. I also ordered their albums as a result of enjoying their songs so much! I would deffinitly recommend the Twilight Soundtrack to anyone who likes good music.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Okay - I cannot wait for the second (and more to come I hope) installment of Ironman.  Loved it!!!  Very action packed and entertaining on all levels...funny, fast-paced, romantic...everything you could ask for.  I really recommend this flick!!
B00005JMK0|5.0|To \\"the powers that be\\"--please release ELECTRIC DREAMS on DVD!  It is an absolutely WONDERFUL film!!!
B001DTPZNY|4.0|Indiana Jones - all the movies - have always been favorites of mine.  This one was no different.  Shia LeBeouf was FANTASTIC and Harrison Ford - awesome as usual.  Terrific movie.....
B001CDLATE|5.0|One if not THE film to see on blu-ray.      Simply put, the film is jaw-dropping spectacular.  A visual feast for the eyes and soul.  Though beware, you cannot only watch five minutes of this film.  Once you start, it pulls you in and before you realize it, an hour has passed.  But what an hour.      No other documentary comes close to showing the beauty of our planet and people.  And oft, the sadness we bring to ourselves.
B001G1ACVY|5.0|This is the BEST CD of 2008 Hands Down...MRAZ delivers. If you thought you loved Jason Mraz before this latest CD tops them all.. a must have!
B000R7HY0K|4.0|Tarantino did it again. [Grindhouse: 'Death Proof'] has everything you need in a movie and if you're a TV junkie like me, that's more than enough. It's got action, sexual appealing, and a cool, simple story line that gets right to the point.
0679809015|5.0|When I was tutoring an otherwise bright person who wanted to learn word processing, I noticed that she needed help with grammar and reading, too.  This book is an excellent choice for an adult who uses poor grammar and has a low reading level.  This person is middle-aged, 50-something, and loved the charming farm animals. She enjoyed using this book immensely herself, sharing it with her little child, too.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|Angelina Jolie rocks in both of the Tomb Raiders, but my personal favorite is 1. Though the second is great too, it Definitely tones down a bit as in hype. The first one's got everything from action to comedy. I definitely recommend this action flick to anyone who likes seeing bad guys and monsters getting their a-hole kicked...by a beautiful woman in tights.
B0013ND30W|5.0|I was actually impressed with this movie in Blu-Ray format.  Extremely clear and colorful, it really is a masterpiece from the old Disney studios!  Maybe better than the original??
1582406723|5.0|ok, first of all, Kirkman wrote his first draft including the coma storyline way before 28 Days Later, so you people crying about \\"plagiarism\\" can go point a finger at Danny Boyle, and while your at it, tell him rotting corpses can't run.       Second of all the people crying that he was in a coma for a month with no care can go climb a tree. IN A GRAPHIC NOVEL ABOUT ZOMBIES THAT'S WHAT YOUR GOING TO HIGHLIGHT AS BEING UNREALISTIC? Your a joke. Also, it never says he was without care for the whole month. Who knows when the hospital cleared out, NOBODY WAS THERE WITH HIM TO KNOW.        Lastly, for those complaining that it follows the motions familiar with Zombie Outbreak story lines, there is a simple reason for that. Romero spent his life perfecting the story line. They go with the obvious outcome and follow the obvious chain of events. How do you think it would  happen? What do you think the government would do? What do you think people would do? I'm pretty sure it'd be something close to what Romero, Krikman, and all the rest have already written or filmed. Kirkman does an amazing job. The first book sets up what happened, which is why it seems familiar.                Someone complained about the white knight saving the black family, but that's just ridiculous. The family he helps happens to be black. If those morons would've made it any farther into the story line they would know that a black man becomes a major character, and saves the white devils plenty of times.                 I have loved Zombies more than any other horror film villain, or literary antagonists my whole life. I have studied the greats, (yes I took a college course in Zombies, you say wasted education, I say the only good reason to go to class in five years). My exposure to this storyline is probably far greater than any other reviewer and I say emphatically that this is some of the best work I have laid eyes on. You feel for the characters. You get to know them in a more intimate way thana 90 minute movie could ever allow. You are along with them until the bitter end. Zombie movies end too fast for every fan, leaving most with a what the hell happens to them now feeling, Kirkman understands that, because he is just like anyone else enthralled with the Zombie story line. Comparing it to other graphic novels this one surpasses anything I have read. As far as entertaining characters, and amazing artwork, there is no comparison. 30 Days of Night doesn't hold a candle. I Am Legend might as well be used as tp. Not that that story isn't great, but the graphic novel has the artwork of a third grader's scribbles xeroxed in black and white three times over. But I'll leave that to my I Am Legend review. Other people have said he spends too much time dialogging every thought and decision, and I'm willing to believe if it wasn't set up that way they would complain that there is no explanation. Some people are going to cry, and judging by the reviews those people never gave this book a chance because they couldn't see past the obvious similarities between 28 Days Later, and this, and that's just sad. They never gave the book a fair chance and they screwed themselves out of an enthralling experience. This series gets more and more amazing as times for the survivors get more and more desperate. Please, get past what those small minded people couldn't and give this book a read. It's the best graphic novel in the last ten years, and I honestly hope it never ends.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I had never seen the entire \\"Matrix\\" collection before but have to say it's really mesmerizing to watch, especially in Blu-Ray.  An excellent value for the price at Amazon.
0471267554|4.0|Overall, a pretty good diet book which is easy to read and understand and follow.      However, in the book Dr. Cordain claims that milk/dairy is bad for you.  He claims that our Paleolithic ancestors did not drink milk, which is probably true, but what he fails to mention is that the European and Near Eastern Caucasian people underwent a natural selection process that enabled them to digest milk.  Meaning, that ancient individuals that couldn't digest milk died off, and the ones that could digest milk thrived and reproduced, and thus furthered their genetic makeup of adult milk consumption.  So obviously, mother nature thought it best to consume dairy products.    No, I refuse to give up dairy products.  Milk, yogurt, ice cream, creamer for coffee is what I live for.  I hate chalky tasting soy.
B001HDO4Z6|5.0|Suprised how good this is for an EP. Can't wait for the next album in 2020!
1569242739|5.0|This book is amazing!  Full of humor and great tips, not to mention wonderful recipes that turn out perfect every time.  I am buying a copy for many of my friends and family for Christmas this year.
B0014DZ2VO|2.0|Quite frankly this movie was a dismal follow-up to Casino Royale. I loved the story driven Royale but Quantum was two hours of shiny objects and pointless characters. The bond girls looked and acted like teenage girls trying to be tough guys. What on earth was the point of the redhead who &#34;was an office worker&#34; being sent to bring Bond in? He's a &#34;Double O&#34; and they send the gopher from the secretary pool to pick him up in a kinky Eskimo-hooker-boot and raincoat outfit? Good move. I guess if we followed that logic in real life we'd send girl scouts after Bin-Laden. Throw the cookies at him girls! Get him! Get him! I do have to admit, however, that Craig and Dench really work well together and their scenes together are spectacular. Aside from that this movie really didn't even seem to try. Maybe because people complained about the long run time for Royale they chopped this one up into tiny bite-sized action shots and shortened it by cutting out all the quieter moments that give us time to breathe and reflect on why that last action scene was necessary while giving us a scene with actual acting and dialogue. Keep the longer run time and give us more intrigue and less explosions. And a less annoying opening montage would be better too.  I have read reviews where some have said that the theme song for Quantum was wonderful because of the two vocalists involved. I hope you realize how flimsy that is. Even Beethoven did some second rate work. I thought that the entire opening sequence from song to visuals was a sad throwback to what made some (just some, not all)of the old bond films laughable in the first place. What is the point of a reboot for a series if you are going to repeat the mistakes of the past? I loved the visuals and music for Royale as they took the old theme and blended it together with some very interesting ideas. Quantum's opener features naked women gadding about to music that seems to have been created by recording two cats being smacked together.  As a closing note I would like to say that this movie, despite comparisons to the contrary, did not remind me of the Bourne films in the slightest. At least those movies kept a thread of dignity and actual plot mixed in with the hectic &#34;Shakey-Cam&#34; action sequences and car chases. What I wouldn't give for a genuine spy film these days.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I was delighted by all the music on the soundtrack.  This album gets me hyped, centered and relaxed.  I would recommend it to all.  If you are not into alternative/rock, maybe not for you.<br /><br />Also, Robert Pattinson, who plays Edward Cullen has a track on it 'Never Think' it's GREAT!  He's very talented.  It's my husband's favorite track on the album.
B0018KLJ06|5.0|So much of what is called neo prog all sounds the same.  Beardfish has a sound which is unique.  Most of the album is, at worst, entertaining progressive rock.  But the main song Sleeping in Traffic is excellent.  If I were to rank the current top progressive rock groups, these guys would be in the range of IQ, The Watch, Pendragon, etc.  The only caveat is that they are not as well tested as IQ and the others.  They need to put out more music before they can enter the higher ranks of progressive rock.
B001PPLIEG|1.0|Cobra-faced actor Daniel Craig--the fifth to play James Bond--is in better shape than the new 007 epic \\"Quantum of Solace.\\" If the previous Bond outing \\"Casino Royale\\" struck you as abysmal, the threadbare \\"Quantum of Solace\\" scrapes the bottom of the barrel. David Bradley's rough & tumble second-unit action sequences and Simon Crane's stunts provide the only bright spots. Unfortunately, neither Craig's virile 007 nor the gripping fisticuffs can salvage this mundane melodrama that resumes the narrative where \\"Casino Royale\\" left off with Bond confronting one of the villains. Subsequently, if you missed \\"Casino Royale,\\" \\"Quantum's\\" plot convolutions may mystify you. Since Bond producer Cubby Broccoli died, the Bond movies have hit the skids. \\"Quantum\\" is the briefest Bond in history and the least compelling if you're a traditional 007 fan. In fact, \\"Monster's Ball\\" director Marc Forster looks like he is making a Jason Bourne thriller rather than a James Bond movie.<br /><br />Ian Fleming's James Bond debuted in 1962 with Sean Connery in \\"Dr. No.\\" The Bond movies revolutionized spy thrillers. Before most people could buy the next Fleming novel, United Artists churned out a sequel \\"From Russia, With Love.\\" The third 007 caper \\"Goldfinger\\" created the template for Bonds, and \\"Thunderball\\" ensured the longevity of the franchise. No sooner had Bond redefined spy thrillers than everybody cloned them. Of course, Bond extravaganzas have always embraced adventure more than espionage. Incredibly, in the Cold War era, the Bond producers refused to censure the evil Soviet empire. Instead, 007 battled S.P.E.C.T.R.E, a.k.a. Special Executive for Counter-Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion with larger-than-life villains straight out of old cliffhanger movies like Ming the Merciless from the Flash Gordon serials. The Bond movies displayed no qualms about occasionally slamming the Red Chinese. After \\"You Only Live Twice\\" in 1967 the Bonds backed off Mao's minions.<br /><br />Since \\"Casino Royale,\\" the new Bonds have forsaken everything that made the longest running franchise original. Audiences watch Bond movies for 007's gadgets, the girls, the exotic locales, and the outlandish stunts. Not only were Bondian foes arch villains who sought to destroy society, but they hatched bizarre plans to achieve their ends. Sometimes, Bond movies scuttled credibility to keep up with the times. For example, \\"Star Wars\\" inspired \\"Moonraker.\\" Nevertheless, 007 gallivanted from one bed to the next for nymphs with naughty names, trumped a gallery of heinous henchmen, and saved the world from extinction.<br /><br />By 1989, Cubby Broccoli overhauled the series with the gritty, hard-as-nails \\"License to Kill.\\" The strategy backfired, and United Artists refused to promote the picture. After the \\"License to Kill\\" debacle, Pierce Brosnan donned the tuxedo and Cubby restored the Roger Moore formula. When production costs escalated, the new Bond producers sacked Brosnan and started from scratch. \\"Casino Royale\\" harkened back to the level-headed \\"For Your Eyes Only,\\" but the success of prequels--primarily George Lucas's second \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy --prompted daughter Barbara Broccoli to re-start the franchise with Bond earning his license to kill.<br /><br />\\"Quantum of Solace\\" breaks more rules that \\"Casino Royale.\\" The trademark gun barrel opening scene that started the 20 previous Bonds now precedes the end credits. Actually, \\"Quantum\\" qualifies as a sequel to \\"Casino,\\" something the Bonds have never done. Neither Ms. Moneypenny nor Q return. \\"Casino Royale\\" wrapped with Bond getting the drop on the villainous Mr. White. \\"Quantum\\" opens with 007 careening in his Aston Martin through scenic Italy with a carload of trigger-happy thugs blasting away at him. Bond has Mr. White of \\"Casino Royale\\") stashed in the trunk. He delivers White to M for interrogation. No sooner has their interrogation begun than M's bodyguard Mitchell (utility stunt man Glenn Foster) starts shootingand White escapes. Before he does get away, White chuckles about how the anonymous criminal syndicate that he belongs to has infiltrated virtually every intelligence agency in the world.<br /><br />Bond chases Mitchell and kills him. Meanwhile, British Intelligence traces the money that Le Chiffre, the \\"Casino Royale\\" villain, used to a geologist in Panama. Bond tangles with a goon hiding in the dead geologist's motel room. He recovers an attach&eacute; case that leads him to a mysterious dame. Camille (Olga Kurylenko of \\"Hitman\\") has been sleeping with Dominic Green (Mathieu Amalric of \\"Marie Antoinette\\"), a hypocritical megalomaniacal environmentalist. Every time 007 collars a bad guy, Green's people ice them and frame Bond for the killing. Green plans to topple the Bolivian government so he can buy up the country's water supply and resell it at higher prices to its new president. Green installs the corrupt General Medrano (Joaqu&iacute;n Cosio of \\"Hitgirl\\") in the presidential palace. Medrano, it turns out, murdered Camille's father, strangled her mother and her sister. Camille's pursuit of Medrano resembles the Roger Moore Bond movie \\"For Your Eyes Only.\\" Bond teams up with Camille to thwart Green and Medrano.<br /><br />Just as the villains in \\"Casino Royale\\" were lightweights, the \\"Quantum of Solace\\" villains are twerps who endanger their own people more than 007. Green wields an axe against Bond but is so incompetent that he whacks his own foot. Green's scheme to monopolize natural global resources is negligible compared with better Bond villains. The fights and the shoot-outs grow monotonously repetitive. \\"Quantum of Solace\\" barely registers on the Richter scale of excitement.es get away, White chuckles about how the anonymous criminal syndicate that he belongs to has infiltrated virtually every intelligence agency in the world.

1400032717|5.0|I loved the different approach of hearing the story from the perspective of an autistic character. It certainly added a fresh element to the humdrum of a lot of modern fiction. This book was captivating, and I not only wanted to know what happened next, but how it would be perceived by Christopher. If you want something different that's a relaxed and entertaining read, then pick this up.
0198326769|5.0|A great book that makes you sit up and think. I cant wait to see the movie, if it is half as good as the book.<br />The best book I have read for a while.

B00012QKSI|1.0|Other reviewers have noted songs missing from the soundtrack version they purchased, and songs recorded by no-names instead of the original artists.  But the worst transgression has not been mentioned yet - and it is huge.  I wanted this CD in order to have a recording of Olivia Olson's standout performance of \\"All I Want for Christmas.\\"  Not only is the version on the CD a studio recording - not the version from the movie - but the sound quality is simply heinous.  It is like listening on AM radio to music that was originally recorded in a metal room from two microphones placed on the floor.  It is tinny, there are echoes, and the sound from the instruments mixes all together in a cacophonous mash.  What a disgrace, and what a disservice to Ms. Olson.  And at this writing, the movie version of the song is not available in either of the two most popular download formats.  Amazingly, a version posted on YouTube (www dot youtube dot com slash watch?v=VkihOkI_7eM) has far superior sound quality.  Now I'll be buying the DVD, and I'll have to figure out how to rip the music from that to add to my playlist.  I can only guess that those who raved here about this CD could not care a whit about this cut, the missing cuts, or the cuts by no-names.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|The more I listened to this Cd the more I find myself liking nearly every song.  It is so rare these days for me to like more than one or two cuts on an album.  David is extremely charming and in truth has the voice of a Rock Angel.  Highly recommended for all except the close minded 'it can't sound even a little commerical' crowd.
B000ULQV0W|5.0|I am usually not a huge fan of soundtrack albums, but while watching \\"Into The Wild\\" I was captivated by the performance of Eddie Vedder.  In fact I found it one of the best parts of the movie.    On this record he harkens back to acoustic Pearl Jam style songs, so Pearl Jam fans will like this.    The songs are well written and his vocals are emotional and captivating.  Highly recommened as a soundtrack record as a addition to Pearl Jam fans collections.
B001GJOL22|5.0|In a word, the Blu-Ray release of Snakes and Arrows is: Amazing.  I will caveat this review with the fact that I am a Rush fan, and have been for twenty years.  That being said, this concert, this show(s), this chapter in their career is a benchmark for others to follow.  In an interview I read, Geddy Lee indicated that this release was done for the fans.  To the viewer and fan, it is immediately evident.  Shots are much longer and cut to catch a fill of Neil's, the fretwork of Alex, or the plucking of Geddy.  Gone is the jerky editing of Rio and to a lesser extent R30.  If you never had the chance to sit in the front row (like me!) of a Rush concert, while still taking in the atmosphere of the stage from high in the back (much more like me!), now is your chance.  The HD imagery shows off details either us as fans, or concert goers, have not seen before.  You can almost count all of the hairs underneath Geddy's lower lip and read the label on Alex's jeans (Not that I really was trying mind you).  The image is simply impeccable and the view it gives you of their musicianship is phenomenal.  The DTS-HS audio puts you front and center.  Geddy's base is firmly to the right, Alex is on the left and Neil is all over the place.  The mix provides just the right amount of atmosphere from the crowd too.  During the Main Monkey Business, check out the crowd clapping along.  It is subtle, but brilliantly done.<br /><br />For a Rush experience, I know this is a disc I will go back to again and again.  This is not Rush flogging another live disc out there for the money, this is Rush throwing one out there for the fans. As a fan, I am glad that they did.

B000H5TH1Q|3.0|Is this really a 'wide Screen' version ? It is a 16/9 image,  but not a 2.38 as it should be
B000286RNY|5.0|If subtitles are not an issue, then by all means consider this fine selection.  It has it all, drama, comedy, action, adventure and my 5 star rating. I could bore you with details but that is pretty much useless for this type of movie. What you need to know is that it is loads of fun!  BTW, I also loved his other film, Kung Fu Hustle.  Chow is currently in production on Kung Fu Hustle 2, and pre-production on The Green Hornet (he will star as Kato!).

The staff at my local store are gonna be very frustrated if I take another copy back!  What to do?  There are many many postings about faulty discs (and I have tried the discs in different players, so it must be a manufacturing defect or copyright technology issue...).<br /><br />Help!
B001KVZ69I|4.0|I just returned from taking 3 young boys(ages 9-11) to see this film.  They are all pretty mature and know a lot about the Holocaust already, but I think that this film made them realize the actual horror of the Holocaust in a way that books can't.  That the story is told through the eyes of a very precocious 8-year-old kept their interest, even though virtually all the film's violence is implied or happens off-screen. I had no idea the film ended as it did, and we all walked out in silence.  Yet, the more we discussed it on the way home, the more we saw the irony--well, perhaps poetic justice, in a sense-- of the film's message of evil and the way it takes root, and how you can't participate in it and still keep yourself and your family separate from it.  The message is transferable to so many modern situations that this alone makes the film worthwhile.  Yes, the boys' conversations would have been spotted very quickly--yes, the ending requires you to take a leap of logic...but the performances and the moral of the movie render it worthy of a viewing.  By the way, Vera Farmiga as Bruno's mother is superb.
B001GKYBXA|3.0|After the heavily electronic and instrumental-oriented first two Fireman CDs, this third disc takes a 180, veering sharply into wilder and more psychedelic territory.  I feel somewhat generous giving Electric Arguments three stars.  That's probably about one star too many for this collection of experimental music pieces. (The word \\"song\\" doesn't quite apply to most of the tracks on this album.)  I guess I'm giving him credit for making a musical expedition of the headphones variety, one that plays like the soundtrack to a bad acid trip but still has more than its share of interesting moments along the way.  McCartney and producer Youth haven't completely abandoned the electronics - they seem to pop up more often on the later cuts - but the musical fragments that make up the CD also employ other styles including blues (the opening track and a couple of other places), quasi-gospel (on \\"Lighthouse\\") and some actual rock here & there.  Before deciding on this CD, though, I suggest you preview the music by listening to the song samples in the Amazon listing or elsewhere.  You should NOT expect anything like a traditional McCartney pop record!
0375826726|1.0|I really can't say more than what was already said in the reviews by Christopher Lingel or racapowski.      I have been reading fantasy and science fiction for the better part of fifty years, and I have seldom not wanted to finish a book. this is one of those times.  I started this series in the hopes of finding something new and different, but it wasn't too long before it was clear that the races, places, and plots were borrowed from truly notable fantasy titles, and only given a very thin veneer of originality.     I was really done with this series before the end of the second book and never intended to buy the thirdr. as luck would have it, a well meaning friend gave me this third book as a present, and I felt slightly obligated to at least open it.  i should not have bothered. its either insane violence where religious fanatics are cutting off pieces of themselves, a long litany of roran's hammer blows to various body parts, or page after page after page or Eragon's navel gazing.    when this book isn't disturbingly violent, its depressingly dull as we spend close to a century learning how the dwarves choose a new leader. the author must have watched the newer star wars movies too often; eragon is the masterful rider one moment and a whining teenager who hasn't learned even the simplest lesson the next.    random characters are inserted in equally random places, unnecessary subplots clutter the landscape, and the dialogue is about as clear and interesting as urgal grunts.  when i realized after the 300 pages covering the trip to the dwarves that this was NOT going to be the last book in the series as we were led to believe, i closed it for the last time about 150 pages from the end. it now resides in a box for donations to the local library.    its obvious that paolini's true talent is in sales and marketing- it took a true genius at both to get this published.
6305076995|4.0|This is a good video record of one of Yes's concerts at their peak of popularity and arguably, their peak of musical greatness. The video and sound quality of the video is good for 1972. Steve Howe is showcased particularly well by this video. My main frustration, and main criticism is the conspicuous lack of justice done to Rick Wakeman; the video didn't even focus on him while he was playing his keyboard solo for Close to the Edge, one of the most memorable solos in progressive rock. Considering how few good videos available of Yes in the 1970's, it's a must-have for major Yes fans.
0805028846|1.0|I returned a popup book which didn't fulfill my needs.  I received a full refund.  I'm very happy with Amazon, and have bought mny thing over the years.  Thanks for all you do.
0345350499|5.0|This is one of the most beautifully written and crafted books I have ever read. The characters are so real you feel as if you know them, the narrative so well woven that you want to read the whole novel in one sitting. I was sad when I finished it because I didn't want it to end. From start to finish, an incredibly moving, enchanting masterpiece. There is nothing I can say that would praise this book highly enough.
B001GKYBXA|5.0|The new Paul McCartney is the biggest musical surprise I've had all year. I was expecting yet another disappointment in a long line of disappointments or mediocre releases and was hoping there would be one or two good songs.    To me, this sounds like Sgt. Pepper mixed with the White Album. Add liberal doses of dance, trance, elecronic and pop and you have a mind pleasing and teasing mix. For my money this is his best musical release since 1975's Venus and Mars or 1973's Band on the Run. It's the sound of creativity not channeled with commercial expectations. It's melodic and fun, odd and enchanting, foot tapping and mind expanding.    I found myself looking at the CD to get the name of almost every song as I listened because the music interested me enough that I wanted to know the name of the individual song. Surprise yourself and pick up this CD. Put it on at a quiet moment and sit back and enjoy the ride.

B001ACH4DS|3.0|In my opinion, most of the songs sound overproduced.  Tracks 8-11 are the best of the bunch but I believe he is capable of putting out something much better.  I hope a follow up CD has more edge to it.

0307120007|5.0|My little brothers and I all had our own copies of Pat the Bunny. (Fifty or 60 years ago the books were made of paper and didn't last long enough to be handed down to another child.) Now I give Pat the Bunny to all my friends' babies for their first birthdays. The mothers are always thrilled to receive the books, and the babies love them! (For second and third children, I give Pat the Puppy and Pat the Cat; from the fourth child onward the cycle begins again with Pat the Bunny.) Highly recommended!
031606792X|5.0|I loved the book and thought it was the best of the Twilight series. I loved Book 3. The book is broken into 3 books. They're all the same story just book1's narrative is Bella, Book2 is Jacob, and book3 is bella again.!!! I don't want to spoil, but you must read it!!!!!!!
B001EOQWEO|5.0|As much as I loved 'Finding Nemo' I never thought another animated film would surpass it by way of entertainment.  However, Wall-E has achieved exactly that.<br /><br />First, I was gob-smacked to realize in hindsight that there is no spoken language for a considerable amount of time at the beginning of the film.  It's substitute is the body language between a very antique robot and the cockroach that he befriended.<br /><br />Second, the interaction between Wall-E, the cockroach and later, Eva, another robot, though a very high tech one, is captivating beyond expectations.<br /><br />I don't want to give away any of the story, but would like to say that this film is a gem in it's genre and sure to collect an Academy award in 2009.<br /><br />Go and watch it.  You won't be disappointed.  There is something for everyone here.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I WAS THRILLED TO RECEIVE \\"THE WEST WING THE COMPLETE SERIES COLLECTION'.IT WAS AN OUTSTANDING SHOW - well written, well acted.  it is so enjoyable to put on the dvd and watch the show with no commercial interruptions.  I have been watching one dvd a night which includes 3or 4 episodes plus commentary by the director, the writer, the producer and the outstanding actors.  This collection is well worth the money and is utter enjoyment.
B001ED7C58|4.0|So, I don't actually own the soundtrack, but going into the movie I didn't really expect much as far as music. Instead I was surprised by The Black Ghosts caressing my ears as the movie started. I think their choice of music was quite excellent, I for one am thankful for the lack of evanescence...  I notice however that they left Radiohead (which was playing during the credits) off of the soundtrack, a band which I personally thought would be fitting for this movie.
B001DHXT20|4.0|Better than \\"The Hulk\\" of 2003. Great fight scene toward the end. Yet a little short and could use more depth even for an action movie. Edward Norton does an exceptional job as Bruce Banner.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|IF YOU LIKE \\"BROKEBACK MOUNTAIN\\", THAN YOU WILL DEFINTELY LOVE THIS FILM. ALTHOUGH I AM A BIG FAN OF BROKEBACK, THE ACTORS IN \\"SHELTER\\" I THOUGHT WERE MUCH MORE INTENSE...AND NOT TO MENTION MUCH MORE SEXY. FOR NOT BEING HOLLYWOOD ACTORS BRAD ROWE AND THE GUY WHO PLAYS HIS BOYFRIEND ARE VERY TALENTED INDEED. THEY DELIVER A POWERFUL PERFORMANCE IN THIS BEAUTIFUL COMING OF AGE STORY THAT CAN REALLY BRING TEARS TO YOUR EYES. THE ACTING IS SO PERFECT THAT ITS ALMOST AS IF THE ACTORS ARE REALLY BOYFRIENDS. HEATH LEDGER AND JAKE GYLLENHALL DID AN EXCELLENT JOB IN BROKEBACK. BUT SHELTER IS A MUCH MORE SWEETER LOVE STORY. ALTHOUGH AT FIRST GLANCE THE GUYS SEEM STRAIGHT AND ACT AS SUCH, ITS AMAZING TO FIND THAT PEOPLE ARE NOT ALWAYS WHO THEY SEEM TO BE. THE ENDING IS AT LEAST VERY SATISFACTORY. ANOTHER BONUS TO THIS FILM IS THAT NOT ONLY ARE THE MAIN CHARACTERS GOOD LOOKING, BUT SO IS THE ACTOR WHO PLAYS BRAD ROWE'S BROTHER. THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER \\"EXTRAS\\" WHO ARE EQUALLY GORGEOUS. THIS MOVIE IS PERFECT FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE IN THE CLOSET AND WANT TO FIND YOURSELF. IT TEACHES A LOT ABOUT BEING TRUE TO ONESELF AND OTHERS AND HAVING THE COURAGE TO FIGHT FOR WHAT YOU BELIEVE IN AND WHO YOU LOVE.
B001FSDOZO|1.0|This band sucks, they have always sucked and will always suck as they keep remaking the same album like AC/DC except worse.  The lyrics are childish and stupid, the music is predictable and usual useless nickleback sounding and just plain tired.  This band needs to go away for good.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|1) excellent, stellar audio mixing  2) thanks Rush for giving us the 4 tracks from the second leg, and giving the fans what they want, not many bands do this, am grateful  3)funny, can do without spendthreft off S&A, funny the 4 songs not played are probably the best on the cd (i.e. Good News First....,,,)  4)also, whoever is in charge of the video, you are missing Neil's best fills/drumming, not sure how you are doing him justice, totally surprising when you are focusing on the wrong member  5) props to the audio engineer though...2nd to none, the 5.1 is superior to the pcm  6)the bonus 4 songs from Atlanta,video guy got it right, unlike the main show; they should have just filmed the dvd in the states; hopefully next time!  7) thanks again Rush for giving us the ENTIRE and COMPLETE show AND MORE!!!! unlike some other bands (i.e. Live)  :)
B000EF7W3Y|5.0|This edition of Fishermans Blues was and is a lot of fun to listen to. From the title track to their cover of Dylans Girl of the North Country on the bonus disc, i've found this album a lot of fun to have and enjoy. I'd recommend this cd to just about anybody that's a fan of good music. Strange Boat, We will not be lovers, Sweet Thing, and  Nobody 'Cept you are all good ones! I only wish that the short 30 to 50 second versions of \\"This land is your land\\" and \\"The Good Ship Sirius\\" were full length.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|I've never enjoyed a television series as much as The Gilmore Girls.  It is clever, smart, funny, timely and relative - a perfect choice for a household with pre-teen and teenage girls (and their mother.
B001GQ2TGA|5.0|Okay. Other reviewers have said it. This is more of the same, but for me that's a good thing because I love Enya. One Toy Soldier is my favorite, possibly followed by  Journey of the Angles. If you're an Enya fan, you probably won't be disappointed.
192076920X|3.0|Having lived in India for about a year now, I find this book to accurately depict the real country, warts and all. It is not the normal romantisied version of tea and croquet on the lawn. I don't live in Mumbai so was very glad to get a first hand description of the city and would love to spend some time there exploring it all.<br /><br />The characters were well created, even the unlikeable ones, which is realistic. I didn't like the main character Linbaba. He came across as a wounded bird who was pretending to be a strong silent eagle. He needed some serious therapy, but being such a macho man, would never seek it. The love of his life, Karla was equally as annoying because she was just plain high maintenance and needs just as many therapy sessions to get over herself. Honestly!<br /><br />The story is well written and a great journey through a land of intrigue, violence and war. Linbaba's world is not a safe place and he made some seriously dangerous decisions, which I suppose is easy to do when you are wrapped up with the mafia types in any city. He did, however manage to do some good in the slum areas and I loved the characters there the most. They are far more likeable than the stoned and drunk westerners who all seem to be hiding from the law for various reason.<br /><br />Anybody who wants to travel to India should first read this book, because it explains the culture and mindsets very well.
B0000035E7|5.0|Great hard rock debut, this was the guts of grunge and a revolutionary time in music.  Hard and heavy, yet soulful and unique, truly amazing.
B00110K62U|5.0|I've always loved Les Miserables as the music has been so invigorating and the storyline so challenging! If you loved the original musical when it came out in 1985 then you've got buy this as it has many of the original actors singing those roles again such as Colm Wilkinson as Valjean, Alun Armstrong as Thenadier and my favorite, the gorgeous Michael Ball once again as Marius!  Not meaning to leave out any of the women being Ruthie Henshall, Jenny Galloway, Judy Kuhn, Hannah Chick and the beautiful Lea Salonga all sung their roles with great power and beauty.   The prised part would have to be when Cameron Macintosh and Co got together 17 men who sang Jean Valjean around the world and it's great fun listening to 'Do you hear the people sing' being sung in their native voices.
B001GQACGO|1.0|I cant say i was dissapointed because I am not a fan of Beyonce. I bought this album because I fell in love with it's first release \\"If I Were a Boy\\", and also because the preview of disc 1 sounded like my style. If I could give this album a 5 and a 1 at the same time, I would. I love the soft sounds and ballads of disc one while I hate SASHA FIERCE. (Becides, what kinda stupid name is Sasha Fierce? And why do you need another name for the same kinda music you've been doing all along) Also, why release two versions of an album at once. Seems like they just wanted to find a way to charge us all an extra 5 bucks. Who would buy an album without all the songs?<br /><br /> I am Sasha Fierce is Beyonce's approach to show she has range in music styles. It's supposed to be her most personal album, yet it sounds like a compilation of love songs and club songs. Disc one is songs of relationship and of a girl in love. Part two is very annoying, the first part with horrible songs that sound like every other rap song on the radio. As the first reviewer on amazon said, it was pointless to have this album on two discs, and plain annoying.<br /><br />Disc One starts with the beautiful, emotional ballad, \\"If i were a boy\\" which beautifully displays Beyonce's voice range. It just feels right at all points. Unfortunately it is the best track on the entire album. Halo, also strong, has a feel-good rhythm, kinda like R.Kelly's \\"I believe I can fly\\". The music however, reminds me of 2004 U2. [[ASIN:B00004Z0LW All That You Can't Leave Behind]](one of my fav bands) She kinda sounds like a female, better sounding Bono. I like it, a lot. Dissapear, soft and smooth, (still reminds me of U2 somehow) is calming, and definately a stress reducer. It is very un-beyonce, at times she seems bored with the song herself, like they had to drag her to the studio to record it. Broken-hearted girl and Ave Maria are okay. It's pretty much a nice song about nothing. Probably would mean more to the person it was written for. To the rest of us it makes no sense. Kinda boring after the first 2 times. The rest of Disc 1 is competely forgettable. Sattelite and That's Why your beautiful would put you to sleep. I like mainly because the music reminds me of U2 (did i mention that before?)<br /><br />Disc 2 = GARBAGE<br /><br />All the single ladies is one of the most annoying songs you ever heard. I cant describe it better than noise and shear grief. Radio is also quite annoying. Its possibly something you could dance to in the club. Diva is the dumbest song i've ever heard. I sounds like Lil Wayne's \\"a Million\\" but like a cheap, effortless, sensless, repeatative, ghetto, and uninspiring version. I would be embarrased to have my name on this song. I kinda like sweet dreams. It's like Beyonce' singing one of Natasha Beddingfield songs. Video Phone is also garbage, and really forgettable. Hello sounds like it belongs on disc one, but it has urban edge in the verses only. Possibly the only song worth listening to on disc two.<br /><br />Don't buy into the hype. This album is not worth buying. I should have just downloaded \\"if i were a boy\\". Beyonce has a beautiful, one of a kind voice. I feel like she's not reaching her full potential with this album. Beyonce fans, don't waste your money. Female U2 and Natasha Bedingfield fans, get it, then throw away Disc 2.r. To the rest of us it makes no sense. Kinda boring after the first 2 times.

B000AP04OM|5.0|I've loved this movie since I was very young and was so happy when I could buy it on DVD for such a cheap price! I love the music and the story but what I loved about this version is the reunion of all of the actors and actress' still around in 2005! Julie Andrews, Christopher Plummer, Charmain Carr, Nicholas Hammond, Heather Menzies, Duane Chase, Angela Cartwright, Debbie Turner and Kym Karath.  They all looked so happy to be with each other again and they made it look like they were the Von Trapp family again!
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|This is the best Rush video to ever come out I have seen most of them and this one has better sound and quality than previous Rush videos. So if your a Rush fan or just curious about the best live band around get this one!
B00000I0XW|5.0|I'm a huge fan of Sarah Brightman's and listening to her sing all of these amazing Andrew Lloyd Webber songs is great! My favourite song would have to be Amigos Para Siempre the song she sings with Jose Carreras which always gets repeated a couple of times.  I was also happy to finally find an album of Sarah Brightman's with Michael Crawford on it too as the phantom and not Steve Harley for a change!  Recommend this album to anyone who love's Andrew Lloyd Webber's music or the voice of Sarah Brightman!!
0525478183|5.0|...That is my suggestion to readers of John Green. \\"Paper Towns\\" begins as an exploration of the restless angst of a group of high school seniors in Florida as graduation approaches, but it morphs into something considerably deeper, a dark mystery that may not be entirely solvable. This novel is a bit deeper and more complex, for example, than Green's earlier \\"An abundance of Katherines\\". As I read, I found myself comparing it to THE hot young adult novel of the moment: \\"Twilight\\" by Stephenie Meyer. The comparison reveals the shallowness and unrealistic romaticism of Twilight, which invites teen or adult women to forget the real world for a bit. By contrast, Green asks young people to look at life and relationships in an adult way, to learn a few things about human nature, and to perhaps mourn. Real mourning, about real life.     That is not to say that this story is dark and dismal start to finish. There is a great deal of humor in this tale, as Quentin and his best buds throw caution to the winds in seeking their destinies at the end of high school, and jump into a van together on an epic road trip to rescue the near mythical Margo Spiegelman. But the thing of it is, Margo is not a myth, she is a real girl, with real problems.     It is wonderful to read a young adult novel in which the protagonist seeks to solve a complex puzzle by using Walt Whitman's \\"Leaves of Grass\\" as a roadmap. It is wonderful to read a book for young adults that is about important things, real things, complex and painful things. As Quentin learns, we all have cracks in us that let in the light, and let our own light out. We are all broken, and we can all survive.     For a thoughtful teen reader this is great stuff, and adults can enjoy it too. While Green has certain characteristics (road trips, nerds, boy bonding, complex boy/girl romantic entanglements) in his works that mark them as his, he is also exploring fresh territory. Hitch a ride, it is worth it.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Director Andrew Stanton (Cars, etc.) does it again! [[ASIN:B00005JNS0 Cars (Widescreen Edition)]]<br /><br />What a great film and a great DVD that's been put out by Disney-Pixar.<br /><br />Yes, of course there are messages about the environment, but critics to the contrary (the one star wonders) this is a message that needed to be said.  And said in a very entertaining way.<br /><br />It's a love story -- the little trash compactor Wall-E who is the last of his kind, achieved sentience and collects all kinds of stuff.  Talks to my inner pack rat.  And EVE, the female robot with the electronic giggle who shoots straighter than Annie Oakley and though at first run by her \\"directive\\" can bypass her programming and make things happen.  Gee, I might be set up in my \\"programming\\" too -- Internet, TV, commercials, etc., etc.<br /><br />It's a sci fi nostalgia:  Otto the Wheel auto pilot of course is an echo of HAL in the great film 2001: A Space Odyssey -- they even play the theme from it![[ASIN:B000UJ48SG 2001 - A Space Odyssey (Two-Disc Special Edition)]]<br /><br />It's a film of discovery:  I don't just want to survive, I want to live.<br /><br />It's a wake-up call that there's more to life than shopping malls and insincere mega-corporations (B&L)....  And are we blocking out so much human contact through the internet and sucked so into our iPods we forget there are people out there to meet and greet.<br /><br />It's a seamless animation piece.  The sound effects, live action and animation are so seamless, so perfect -- Pixar has really raised the standard.<br /><br />The DVD:  Interesting box, funny reticular cover.  Little cardboard holder for the DVD itself with a list of scene selections.  Burn-E, another little robot droid who gets sucked into the adventure of Wall-E and EVE.  Presto, a fun animation that harkens back to the good old cartoon days of Hanna Barbera and Chuck Jones films of the fifties and sixties.<br /><br />Deleted scenes add a bit more to the story but nothing spectacular.  Wall-E's tour of the universe takes us out there, gives a bit more animation.<br /><br />The legends of Disney sound effects and animation go into fascinating detail.  If you're a history buff of Disneyania, then this is for you.<br /><br />Sneak Peeks gives us the low-down on the newest DVDs coming out: Prince Caspian, the 70th anniversary of Pinocchio and more.  Actual NASA space shots in a lot of sequences.<br /><br />And of course the advertising and the yada yada we're Disney blah blah.

B000EWBKKI|3.0|Let me start this by saying Terminator 2 is one of my all time favorite movies. When I purchased a Blu Ray player, this was one of the first movies I picked up. Unfortunately there is not much difference between this and a regular DVD. It was so disappointing I nearly returned the Blu Ray player. After some research I found this was a poor example of Blu Ray.     Unless they come up with a better quality transfer I would save my money and stick with the DVD - although at $[...] for the blu ray there is not much savings.     I would suggest checking out this thread before purchasing blu ray movies.    (...)
B0013ND30M|5.0|I love this movie~  Sleeping Beauty is a must-have for any disney collector and this is a great edition to have!
B0015AARJI|5.0|I'd always been an XBox guy. One of the things I preferred about the XBox compared to the Playstation was the controller. It's got a big, meaty controller that fills out your hands nicely, while I always felt like previous Playstation controllers felt light, cheap and flimsy. Well, a couple months ago, I bought a PS3. I needed a Blu-ray player and I figured I might as well spend a little extra and get a gaming system with it too. What I like about the Dual Shock Sixaxis is that it's a little heavier than previous controllers, and it just feels solid and sturdy in your hands. The buttons are nice and responsive, and they're well-placed from an ergonomic standpoint. Highly recommended.
B001ACH4DS|3.0|I find it pretty irritating, when the majority of people who have written reviews here, would give David Cook 5 stars if he burped into a microphone for 60 mins straight.  This is by NO MEANS a 4.5 star album, as the current amazon rating system suggests.  I love David Cook more than anyone else (and voted for him 100's of times), but let's be serious about this review, shall we?<br /><br />I've waited a few weeks, waiting for the album to really absorb into me, before writing my views on it.  I didn't want to jump the gun and write a review on the first day, like so many did, because that's just a first impression.<br /><br />With that said, while this debut David Cook album wasn't a complete BUST, it's not very good.  I'd give it 2.5 stars out of 5, but I'll give DC an extra half star, since amazon's voting system is faulty in that regard.<br /><br />This album has a rushed feel to it.  Seems like all of the songs were hurried together, and David isn't emotionally connected to any of them, for the most part.  The only exceptions are \\"Life on the Moon\\", and \\"Permanent\\", which he definitely had a connection to.  The other songs, he's just merely going through the motions.  Basically, looking at a song sheet that someone else wrote, and singing Karaoke-style over music that he didn't come up with either.  He was able to pull it off terrifically on Idol, but not on his debut album, sorry to say.<br /><br />That's basically the theme of this entire CD... just no connection to any of the songs.  I wanted to LOVE this album.  This was honestly one of my most anticipated albums in several years (besides Guns N' Roses Chinese Democracy).  Unfortunately, I feel like this album should have been delayed a number of additional months, so he could develop some kind of emotional bond with the songs.<br /><br />Stand out songs on the album, like I said, are \\"Life on the Moon\\", which is truly a great song, \\"Bar-ba-sol\\", which is the only 'hard rock' song on the CD, and \\"Permanent\\", which is a gut-wrenching song, most likely written about his cancer-stricken brother.<br /><br />\\"Light On\\", as we all know from being his first release, was actually a Chris Cornell throwaway.  He didn't write it FOR or WITH David Cook.  He tossed it, just like Avril Lavigne tossed \\"Breakaway\\" to Kelly Clarkson.  Light On is a good song as well.<br /><br />2.5 stars out of 5, in my opinion.  David Cook can do SO MUCH better.  It's a shame they released this album prematurely, before David could get a feel for the songs, and develop an emotional connection with them. I wouldn't recommend this album to anyone but a HARD CORE Cook fan.  Don't believe the many 5-star reviews.  This is one of the only legitimate reviews on here, as far as I see it.<br /><br />As of right now, I have 1 of 6 helpful votes -- for telling the truth.

The bonus tracks are enjoyable as well, in particular \\"games people play-the original version is interesting for the little scat like wale at the beginning that was later refined and moved closer to the end of the song. The songs are great, the melodies are strong, and the lyrics are intelligent and moving. A real high point for the project, and very possibly their best!
B001DJ7PQ4|4.0|I'll admit, I was NEVER a fan of the original Dr Who series. I thought it had some great ideas, but such poor production value (and horrible acting) that it was hard to sit through. What I love about this new show is how Russell Davies has been able to keep the same great ideas from the original (as to please old fans) and push the special effects through the roof (to make it MUCH more watchable for the casual viewer like myself)! Oh sure it's got it's silly moments...okay sometimes VERY silly moments but I think that was done to make it more accessible to younger viewers and they never seem to get in the way of the great story telling.<br /><br />Also what's terrific is the casting choices. David Tennant makes the Doctor character classic from his first episode (I'd go out on a limb and say it's like Harrison Ford and Indiana Jones!), and every companion is instantly likeable from Rose to Martha to Donna.<br /><br />Now, after three seasons of greatness comes this fourth season. If you're a Dr Who fan, purchasing this DVD is a MUST. It again has everything that makes the series great and seems to add some more physical action this time around. If you havent seen the show yet, obviously you have to start with season one (2005).<br /><br />As I said before this season has the same great elements as the previous ones (and I love Catherine Tate as the Doctor's new companion), but I have to admit things seemed a bit more typical and by the book this time around. This isn't neccessarily a bad thing but after the last three seasons, each topping the one before it, I thought that season 4 felt a bit more redundant. It just didn't WOW me like it did in seasons 1-3 (though they did set the bar pretty high). Again this isn't a bad thing at all, just the same great story-telling as you'd expect (though the resolve in the last episode was a BIT over played).<br /><br />If you're a Dr Who fan: buy it (while the price is still low on Amazon), if you're new to the series: start with season one. This show is not to be missed!to be missed!
B0007PLLQ0|5.0|This DVD was a great buy. I paid an excellent price for \\"Legend\\" and was very satisfied with the picture quality. The movie was brand new and in perfect condition. This is a classic old school fantasy flick. It has mythical creatures, fairies, magic and is a timeless tale of good versus evil. You will love the effects, wardrobe, and costumes, as well as the storyline.
B00005JNJV|5.0|I keep forgetting that before the Dark ('DORK') Knight and after the Keaton/Kilmer/Clooney crap there actually WAS a good Batman film made. Not only that, but it's one of the best movies centered around a superhero I've ever seen.<br /><br />Batman Begins takes the usual trademark elements of the Batman mythos (cape/cowl etc) and gives everything an origin that to this point had never been done before. The story involves two underknown Batman villains, retells the origin of Bruce Wayne becoming Batman and knows how to balance seriousness and fun (something the second film FORGOT to do...).<br /><br />The acting in this film is top-notch with Christian Bale making a terrific Bruce Wayne (and a fun over-the-top Batman). Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, and Gary Oldman take on the iconic roles of Alfred, Lucius Fox and Commissioner Gordan while adding a certain class to the movie that was severly missing in the other Batman films.<br /><br />The special effects are great and includes some exciting action sequences (most memorably involving the tummbler through the streets of Gotham).<br /><br />The DVD has the standard bells-and-whistles but nothing seemsto be able to over-shadow the movie itself. Again, to me this film is superhero perfection and more than worth the now cheap price on DVD.
B000Z27HLS|5.0|Okay, I'm a big Jane Austen fan. I watched this movie before I read the book, because I expected the movie would disappoint me, and I knew I would be constantly comparing if I watched it after reading Ms. Austen's masterpiece. However, reading the book afterwards, I was pleasantly surprised by how close to the book the movie really is. The only differences are, of course, the imagined dream sequences and proposal scene, and slight variations towards beginning and towards the end. I thought the dream sequences were very clever and worked with Catherine's character. As to the other liberties taken, they were minor and/or accurate with what I think Ms. Austen would envision. Of course, the book is the ultimate way to experience the story, but I loved this adaption as well. For one thing, it's wonderfully cast. I can't think of a single person that doesn't fit the character they play. JJ Field and Felicity Jones are absolutely perfect! I strongly recommend at least renting or borrowing this adaption. It's one of my favorites!
B00006JIA4|4.0|I received this powerhouse collection of Queen hits as a gift -- which I love. I would have given it five-stars if it had included my favorite track, \\"Keep yourself Alive\\". Nonetheless, I enjoy this collection immensely.
B000YIGNKE|4.0|I thought the movie was pretty good, if unfaithful to the book. The only things (besides various liberties taken with the plot) that were irksome were: 1) Sally Hawkins. I didn't dislike her overall portrayal of Anne Elliot, but there were things that bothered me: for example, she seems to be constantly kind of wavering, or on the brink of panic, or something. I just got tired of her little panting, helpless moments. This leads to the second (and more serious) annoyance: 2) The Kiss. I don't want to give anything away, but seriously, that kiss made me feel slightly sick. I just kind of felt like, if you must start kissing in the middle of the street, DO it already before anyone sees you, don't spend like five minutes hesitating and panting and darting you heads back and forth. Actually, the whole last ten minutes or so were a bit problematic.   Aside from these little issues, though, I really enjoyed the movie. Rupert Penry-Jones is smokin' as the hero and, besides her little hesitancy issues, Sally Hawkins is a very good Anne. I would say if you're a die-hard Jane fan, you might not like this adaption so much, but as an ignorant viewer, you'll probably find this a pretty enjoyable film.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I'm not going to repeat the premise of the show (which is very helpful, but already pointed out by others) These actors are truly gifted in making their characters come to life.  I have watched and re-watched every episode. While my husband was stationed in Iraq, I had to promise I would record every episode for him, which I did. Afterward I happened to notice the first season for sale. There was no hesitation - I bought it immediately (eventhough I had them all recorded) so I could watch it as often as I wanted, with no fear of data loss. This show is very unique and an absolute pleasure to watch. The intertwined relationships of these characters has so much potential. I truly hope this show will last many years. I find myself actually smiling while watching each episode unfold. Big Bang Theory is exceptional entertainment.
B001DU8T6S|2.0|What would motivate the two remaining members of Queen (Brian May, Roger Taylor) to record a new album under the \\"Queen\\" moniker some 17 years after the passing away of lead singer Freddie Mercury? (Original bassist John Deacon passed on continuing.) They recruited Paul Rodgers (of Free and Bad Company) to be the new lead singer, a curious choice, given the stark differences in vocals and theatricals with the late Freddie Mercury, and after a live tour in 2005, they now come again, with new studio material. Let me state upfront that I was highly skeptical.<br /><br />\\"The Cosmos Rocks\\" (14 tracks, 59 min.) starts off with a terrible \\"Cosmos Rocking\\", wanting/trying to prove that the band is a happening, partying band. But things get much better with the hard-charging and romping \\"Time to Shine\\" and \\"Still Burning\\", which to me sound like Bad Company-era tracks, but they works quite nicely. The album really falters with ballads like \\"We Believe\\" and \\"Some Things That Glitter\\" (with the horrible opening line \\"Once I believed in butterflies\\"). But then \\"C-lebrity\\" is a nice surprise, rocking hard.<br /><br />In all, this is not the disaster it could've been, but that's not saying much. For one, the album would've been hugely helped if the running time was toned down to, say, about 40 min., weeding out the worst 4 or 5 tracks. But my biggest beef is that this is not a Queen album, period. It is an ensemble piece of 3 guys, 2 of whom used to be in Queen, and the other in Bad Company. There are some nice tracks on here, but to release this as a \\"Queen\\" is a disservice to the fine legacy of that vintage band (which doesn't sound anything like this album, incidentally).
B0017ZB8M6|3.0|There's a few killer, bouncy dance tracks here including the first two singles, but the remainder is a mixed bag, not quite as catchy, but worth a listen.
B001IB63KQ|5.0|The cd is awesome. You feel like you are at the concert again. Everything you loved about the live versions are in here. Hayley's vocals are great. If youve ever been to a show you know that she runs, jumps around and headbangs the whole time and it's incredible that her voice can still sound so good. The crowd sings the lyrics A LITTLE, not half of the time.
B00127RAJY|5.0|To be perfectly honest I'd never even heard of Jillian Michaels until last week. My sister was raving about her after watching her on the Biggest Loser. I desperately needed a change from my usual workout, read all the reviews here and bought the 30 Day Shred.    Holy freakin' moly! I consider myself a fit person. I do Jari Love's Slim&Lean 3-4 days a week and my job keeps me physically active everyday but I needed more cardio in my life. This DVD delivers! There are 3 different levels starting with level 1 for beginners and progressing to level 3. All are 20 minutes, about 1/2 hour with warm-up and cooldown. All combine strength and cardio and all that is required for equipment are a mat and a set of handweights. Start with a light weight and work your way up! I started with level 1 today and it literally kicked my butt. There is NO resting, if you need a drink of water you better have it right there and make it fast. There were a couple of times when I just could not finish the set even though there were only about 5 seconds left. I think she's very good at cueing and also a great motivator. She does have two others with her, with one demonstrating modified moves if you're just starting out. She also shows you the correct form for some of the moves you might hurt yourself with if not done properly.    This is my new workout DVD. I'm looking forward to progressing to the other levels to see what she has in store for us. The time absolutely flies because you're not stopping but you feel great when it's over. Really gets those endorphins flowing! It is hard but it's quick and it's fun and it's a workout that anyone can do.
B000UBMSB8|4.0|Before seeing this movie i had a lot of different assumptions about it. I knew that it was somewhat of a classic now and i knew i really liked Ridley Scott so i expected to really like it. I also thought it was going to be somewhat of an epic sci-fi action film. It turned out to be a lot different than i expected. The film was on a smaller scale than i expected. The setting of the film was less important than the story unfolding in it. Admittedly i didn't like it as much as i was expecting but it was still really good. Even though the style or genre of the film was different than i was expecting i liked it for that very reason. The way i look at it there are the films that have extraordinary settings and the plot sort of shows it off. Star Wars is a good example of this. The plot involved many aspects of the setting like light speed travel and large space wars. Blade Runner on the other hand was simply a detective story that just happened to take place in the future. Most of the events in the story could very easily happen now. Again, i didnt like it as much as i thought i would but i liked it a lot, just in a different way i was expecting. I definitely want to watch this film again to see i how like it, knowing what to expect.
1596912863|3.0|I love Jane Austen books and the movies that are inspired by her novels ... and when I was younger, I would have loved to live in those days of genteel lives. I am too jaded now to appreciate the wonder of those times (really love my modern comforts these days!). However, this book is a respite from everything that is going on. It's perfect for that but it is just a novel and not a very well-written one at that. I have wondered throughout the entire book just where it was going since it's not your typical chick lit.<br /><br />Jane was bequeathed by an aunt in her will to have three weeks at Pembrook Park, Kent, England, where time has stood still and women like Jane can retreat to a different time and place ... away from the real world. She wanted to get rid of her Darcy obsession once and for all so she is free to move on and marry the man of her dreams ... that is if he ever appears in front of her. Once there, she surrenders all outside contact with the world and stepped into an Edwardian time where manners reigned supreme. Just maybe her Mr. Darcy is there waiting for her. Then maybe not.<br /><br />It is a very sweet and cute novel, but one that no one should take seriously. There is a lot of references to Austen's books and the time period in which she lived as well. It is very predictable and the ending does fall flat on its face but if you like Jane Austen or if you like romances, this novel will fit the bill. There are much better books out there so don't buy it, borrow it from the library or from a friend (like I did). If you're heading home on a long plane ride over the holidays, this book is fluffy enough to keep you entertained.<br /><br />11/26/08
014305841X|5.0|Like any really great natural history, The Omnivore's Dilemma is not so much about what we eat, but who we are.  The book has three main sections - highly-processed (corn-driven) food, local/organic food and self-caught food.<br /><br />The first part on processed food is a thoughtful expose of how culturally removed we've become from the vast majority of the food we consume - removed from its irresponsible calorie content, desensitized to the lives of the animals we consume, and out of touch with its underlying often senseless economics.  Like with Morgan Spurlock's \\"Supersize Me\\", your perspective on McDonald's will be forever changed.<br /><br />The second part of local/organic food is more uplifting.  Pollan shows the difficult, but also bright future, for organic and local eating.  The lesson seems to be if government got out of the way of small producers, they could blossom and grow more significantly.<br /><br />The third part - hunting and foraging for one's own food - is a wonderful look at the joys and moral conflict of catching one's own food, from the perspective of doing it for the first time.  Pollan's reflections on the grace of nature's bounty are thoughtful and grateful.<br /><br />The author concludes with a short meditation on what's he's discovered researching how we eat.  The ending seemed terse, with much left unsaid, but is still satisfying.<br /><br />I listened to The Omnivore's Dilemma unabridged on audio CD narrated by Scott Brick.  Brick gives a fine performance, confident but questioning, appropriately humble for the author's ambitious search and thoughtful reflections.<br /><br />I especially recommend this book to anyone in the food and beverage industry.
B001GQSY5U|2.0|STOP SCREWING WITH THIS FRANCHISE, I BEG YOU. Episodes 4 - 6 practically re-invented the sci-fi genre, but then Episodes 1 - 3 took a serious downturn, due in no small part to the mis-casting of Hayden Christensen and also the violation of what you had set up in 4 - 6. George, what was the point of this film? Where in the timeline of the series does this movie fall? Why didn't we see Anakin's padawan in any of the live-action films? Why have plot and character been sacrificed at the altar of the aciton sequence? Granted, this is an animated movie, which usually means a kid's movie, and with their short attention spans, things have to be kept moving, but understand their parents are the same people who saw Episdoes 4 - 6 when they were kids themselves and are ruining it for them. You are ruining this once-great franchise, so PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE STOP SCREWING WITH IT!!! Thank you.<br /><br />PS: May the Force be with you again, because you've certainly lost it.
B001G5ZKZS|5.0|Ouroboros, the Serpent Holder.    The sign of the Suntelia Aion is the sun rising out of the mouth of the ouroboros, which will occur on the solstice December 21, 2012 which links with the Mayan Calendar as a symbolic date the evolution of consciosness in the alchmey of time. This also goes to Quetzalcoatl and accelerating Earth changes in the Ring of Fire.     The Greeks called the end of the age Suntelia Aion. Plato refered to a cycle of catastrophe at the end of the age. The Suntelia Aion was symbolized by the Ouroboros. The myth of the Ouroboros refers to a serpent of light that resides in the heavens. The Milky Way galaxy is that serpent and when viewed from galactic central point it eats its own tail.    Astrologists say we are entering a new age now, 2010 said by some to be the first year that we spend more days in Aquarius than in Pisces.
044661758X|5.0|The Concrete Blonde is a masterfully told story featuring LAPD detective Harry Bosch.  Author Michael Connelly is as comfortable writing about the courtroom as he is a murder case.  And, he combines both of them in this novel.  Connelly's characters are believable and the details are rich.  In Concrete Blonde, Bosch is trying to solve what may be \\"copy cat\\" murders while he's on trial for shooting \\"The Dollmaker,\\" a serial killer.  But did Bosch kill the right person?  Is the Dollmaker still out there somewhere?  New murders and taunting letters seem to suggest Bosch shot the wrong man.  The evidence points to a couple different suspects, but Connelly keeps you guessing the entire time.  The Harry Bosch series is great.
B0012BX062|5.0|This is the best The Notorious B.I.G. album next to Ready To Die album. These albums are classics and these peoples shouldn't write mean reviews and they don't have a great taste of rap music. These two albums are influentials upon on hip hop history.
B001CZVVVO|5.0|It is like being there, time and again. The images are incredible crisp and bright and the sound is wonderful. Three of the greatest voices of today perform well selected areas of operas and popular songs. You will enjoy every minute of it. Bluray technology really proves itself.<br />I strongly recommend this DVD to watch and listen alone (and may be sing with your favorites singers) or with your friends and family and have a great time. Just like being there.
B001AKTZOG|4.0|I've always thought it odd that the album cover for the original vinyl release of this record showed the songs in a completely different order than they appear on the disc itself. The LP cover starts out with Chameleon, Molina, and It's Just A Thought. The actual record starts out with Pagen Baby, Sailor's Lament, and then Chameleon. A few times the tracks follow each other in the same order but not often.    I have the 20K bit CD of this album, and the songs follow each other in the same order as the original record, with Rude Awakening as the final track.    The new Digipak CD runs the tracks in the same order that they appear on the back cover photo, with an extended version of Hey Tonight as the final non-bonus track.    I wonder which one is John Fogerty's preferred version?    I actually like the 20K version a lot more because Creedence albums are so complete a listen in their original versions. Creedence albums, even when they were only 30 minutes long, had a start-to-finish vibe that really gets messed up by the bonus tracks, most of which seem to be recorded after Tom Fogerty quit. Digipac Pendulum does include one essential bonus track, 45 Revolutions Per Minute. Very whacked out.    The only other Digipac where the extra tracks add anything is their very first record with Susy Q, which has some ABSOLUTELY KILLER bonus tracks that really augment the album.
B00003CXSP|2.0|Hannibal starring Anthony Hopkins and Julianne Moore is a disgusting sequel to The Silence of the Lambs. Jodie Foster refused to reprise her role as Clarice Starling, she sure made the right decision! Moore is awkward as Starling, she has a hard time tackling the accent. Hopkins is still creepy but that scene with the pigs is so vile, I covered my eyes, ugh! Horrible movie, Red Dragon is better than this.
0312370849|3.0|\\"Sarah's Key\\" tells two stories; the first is of a ten year old Jewish girl named Sarah living in France. She and her parents become part of the roundup of Jews conducted by French police in Paris in July of 1942. Because her parents have tried to protect her, she has little understanding of the increasingly perilous situation facing Jewish people. When the police arrive at her apartment, she agrees to her little brother's request to lock him inside a secret hiding place they often used as a play area. She is sure the French police can't really mean them any harm and that they will be allowed to return home soon. What follows for Sarah is a nightmarish journey where she is not only separated from her beloved brother but will soon be separated from her parents as well. The reader watches Sarah change from a loving young girl to one who is filled with bitterness and hatred as she grows in understanding of her situation.<br /><br />The second story takes places sixty years later and involves a woman named Julia Jarmond. She is an American journalist living with her French husband and their daughter in Paris. Julia is assigned to do a story on the sixtieth anniversary of the Jewish<br />roundup. She finds a personal connection to the story when she discovers that the apartment where her French husband's grandparents had lived for years was obtained because the Jewish family that had been living there was taken away in the roundup. She becomes obsessed with finding out what happened to Sarah, the ten- year old girl who had lived there with her parents and her younger brother.<br /><br />Tatiana de Rosnay chooses to structure her novel by having alternating chapters for Sarah and Julia. While I enjoy parallel structures, the chapters were so short that it took awhile to feel fully involved in either story. Without a doubt I felt that Sarah's story was the more successful of the two. I thought the author did an excellent job of showing the reader Sarah's growing comprehension of the horror of her situation. Had the book been about Sarah alone, I would have easily given it four stars. The problem with me was more with Julia's story. While for the most part I found it interesting, I really felt the author tried too hard to tie everything up in a neat little package with a bow on top at the end. I felt it was not needed and in a way it even detracted a bit from the power of Sarah' story. I also have a few minor quibbles; in a couple places the author seemed to contradict herself, and even though it wasn't on anything major it was still a bit jarring. Also, there were some repeated grammatical errors. Again, maybe not a big deal except Julia makes a point of letting us know how educated she is. Maybe in the hands of a more accomplished writer \\"Sarah's Key\\" would have had more resonance; certainly the story had potential.her situation.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|David Cook's debut album is probably the best from all the winners of American Idol. As soon as I saw David Cook on Idol, he was my favorite and I am so glad he won! He and Kelly Clarkson are the only Idol winners that are the real deal. His voice on this album is stellar, I was worried his strong lungs would not translate well in a recording studio - boy was I ever wrong! David belts his rock/pop heart out on tracks like Declaration, Bar-ba-sol, A Daily AntheM, and Life on the Moon. My favorite tracks include Permanet, Avalanche, Come Back to Me, and the first single Light On written by Chris Cornell. Cook's songwriting isn't brilliant but the melodies and his voice make this album a standout. I highly recommend it!
B000002UAX|5.0|Most of the songs on this great album were written in India while the Fab Four were studying Transcendental Meditation with the Maharishi Mahesh Yogi in early 1968. This is also the first album in which not all four Beatles participated on every track. Yet from an artistic standpoint, they remained very strong, although not every track here necessarily was.    Back In The USSR-A rock song by Paul. One of the albums' better tracks. Ringo had temporarily walked out so it's Paul playing the drums here.    Dear Prudence-Written by John and named after Mia Farrow's sister who John said meditated too long. Again, Paul plays the drums.    Glass Onion-A throwaway song by John about people reading too much into his songs.    Ob-La-Di,Ob-La-Da-A cheery song by Paul about two people who marry and raise a family.    Wild Honey Pie-Arguably the album's weakest track. They just chant \\"honey pie\\" during this 52-second song.    Bungalow Bill-Based on someone in India who hunted tigers. Yoko Ono sings a line here.    While My Guitar Gently Weeps-Of the four \\"Harrisongs\\" here, this is definitely George's best one. Eric Clapton of Cream also plays.    Happiness Is A Warm Gun-This is a song containing four parts, each with different tempos. John took the title from a magazine article.    Martha My Dear-A pop song by Paul named after his sheepdog.    I'm So Tired-While in India, John meditated all day and couldn't sleep at night.    Blackbird-An acoustic song by Paul with bird sound effects.    Piggies-A humorous song by George.    Rocky Racoon-A fictional story by Paul set in the Wild West.    Don't Pass Me By-Written and sung by Ringo and featuring a fiddle at the end.    Why Dont We Do It In The Road-A song with just three lines. Paul is solo on this track.    I Will-An acoustic song by Paul.    Julia-An acoustic song by John named after his late mother.    Birthday-This upbeat song was written in the studio. John called it \\"a piece of garbage\\".    Yer Blues-This is John feeling suicidal.    Mother Nature's Son-The lyrics were taken from one of the Maharishi's lectures. Only Paul plays on this track.    Me and My Monkey-A throwaway song by John. It's about him and Yoko.    Sexy Sadie-This is John lashing out at the Maharishi.    Helter Skelter-A rock song by Paul named after an amusement park ride.    Long, Long, Long-The weakest of George's songs on this album. John is MIA on this track.    Revolution 1-A slower, acoustic version of the B-side to \\"Hey Jude\\"    Honey Pie-A novelty song by Paul about an English woman who becomes a Hollywood movie star.    Savoy Truffle-A song by George featuring a horn section. Again, no John on this track.    Cry Baby Cry-John's tale about the goings on in a fictional kingdom. He thought so little of it that in a 1980 interview he said of this song, \\"Not me. A piece of rubbish.\\"    Revolution 9-An 8-minute musical collage assembled by John. You can also hear Yoko and George here.This is more like a John/Yoko track than The Beatles.    Good Night-Written by John and sung by Ringo featuring a choir and orchestra. In 1980, John said this song was \\"possibly overlush\\".    TT Disc One-46:21, Disc Two-47:13
0634049011|5.0|from a purely academic perspective, a guitarist would have a hard time doing better than this bk. like building a wall brick by brick, every chapter adds to the last, re-enforcing the previous lessons as they are applied to new ones. this allows one to build a strong foundation from which to expand understanding of the mechanics of guitar theory and how to apply that info in a functional way.   the amazon entry is a \\"look inside\\" type, so I won't go into the specifics. it's pretty self-explanatory. for me, approaching this info as a lifetime player looking to fill in gaps in fundamentals, a workbook like this was exactly what I needed. if you're serious about your obsession, you will benefit from this book
B00063EMJ6|5.0|I love this CD, I put this on as I drive to work and smile all the way and I do the same thing on my way home. It makes me forget about all the crazy people on the roads. If you are a Neil Young fan you must add this one to your collection.
B001DHXT1G|4.0|This is a review of the Blu-Ray (some of these reviews were simply ported over from the SD), tested on a 42\\" Panasonic Plasma and BD30k BD Player. PQ 4/5, Sound 4/5. The picture had some noise in it, but nothing too distracting; overall, the picture was very sharp, but not the best transfer I've ever seen. The sound was powerful at times, and the DTS sound was powerful and effective during shooting and \\"thunderous/base\\" portions. It was not as powerful as some other Blu-Ray films I've seen.<br /><br />I prefer a gripping story over over the top effects, but you expect the latter when you watch a super hero action movie. I am a fan of Ed Norton and thought his portrayal as a meager guy engulfed in his superpower worked for the film. His \\"every-day guy\\" look worked to express the juxtaposition with the hulk. Liv Tyler continues to be flat in her affect for most of her films, so I just could not sympathize with her character.<br /><br />I do wish that the movie was paced faster. Aside from 3 action scenes, this was a slow moving film in the super hero genre. The last 20 minutes of the film were a standout, where effects are concerned, and the tie in with Iron Man was a welcomed tidbit at the end, which showed continued promise for the franchise.<br /><br />I had hoped that they would take an opportunity to share more info about how the Hulk had gotten his superpower and what research had been done with Betsy's character. I realize this is an action movie, and is not supposed to be a scientific examination of gamma rays and its effects, but I think it would have been interesting to add another dimension.
B000PWQPAC|5.0|Loved it, loved it, loved it.  If you're a GOS fan, while it's different from the series, it's still fun to watch. It's an alternative story line to the series and the other movies but it's still GOS no matter how you look at it. Motoko is just as fiesty as ever, the Tachis - well, they're different but they still have that sense of fun about them, especially in Tachikomatic Daze that is available on the dvd.<br /><br />If you're new to GOS - watch it and watch all the other GOS series. I think you'll enjoy it... especially the Tachikomas.
0930289234|5.0|ok, I'll admit - the main reason why I got interested in the book was because of the teaser trailer that came out before The Dark Knight (which by the way was AWESOME!!!).  I had never heard of Watchmen before and all I kept reading was, \\"most celebrated graphic novel of all time\\", so that added to the intrigue.  Who were these characters?  Why had I NEVER before seen any merch, Saturday morning toons, ice cream truck popsicles even!?!  I had to find out.  I started looking it up online.  First it began with buying the iTune for Smashing Pumpkin's 'The Beginning is the End is the Beginning'.  Then I hit the fan sites hardcore style until I finally found the official Watchmen movie site.<br /><br />The site contained abridged plot schematics of each of the 12 books.  I didn't want any spoilers, I wanted the MEAT of the story!!  So I decided to buy the whole thing.  Mind you, I'm a comic book fan just like the next guy, but I had never actually purchased my own books before.  I was the guy who had friends with boxes full of them that would either recite them to me, or drop the geek guard long enough for me to flip a few pages at a time, but mostly I got my dose of the scene from cartoons and tell-tale.  The fact that this book supposedly was THE book that shaped modern comics as we now know them, also helped in the decision to finally buy my own books.<br /><br />I plunged in, and hard!  Immediately I found out that the trailers for the movie were absolutely deceiving.  I started realizing why I hadn't seen the Ozymandias line of action figures in stores... That toy story-line in and of itself was masterfully scripted with gushing satire spewing all over the pages!  These weren't super heroes!!  These were ordinary Joe's and Jane's with, quite frankly, EFFED up lives... AWESOME!!!  Alan Moore had to have been real upset with somebody in his lifetime to come up with some of the darkness that envelopes this book.  From the dramatic suspense of the mystery aspect, to the down-right freakiness of the Superhero aspect of it with Dr. Manhattan, this book had everything I could have imagined from a sci-fi or suspense drama movie from today!  No way this was written back in the mid-eighties!!  Each character is so incredibly rich and dynamic, that on the last pages, you feel absolutely cheated and begging for more.  The moral implications it leaves you with are enough to make your head spin for days to come, and it only makes you crave just a few more pages to justify your mixed feelings about the ending!!  By far, the most extraordinary book I've ever read.  I believe it's safe to say, that if Dave Gibbons wasn't involved, this book very well could have been acceptable as an ordinary black and white cover to cover novel.  An are-you-kidding-me?-you-haven't-read-it!? kind of book that MUST be in everyone's personal library.<br /><br />I won't say I'm a die-hard fan (mostly because I just found out about it existing and only because of the teaser trailer).  I will say I'm a Watchmen fan who can't wait to see the film's interpretation.  I've heard much about the ending being different, changes made to appeal to the masses, fan rage for even considering making this a film - but all I can say is it's important for this film to come out.  If not for the fact that sheep are going to flock to it expecting the next Batman franchise and coming out totally disappointed (which I can't wait to see myself!!) but because it's a new generation exposed to the greatness of this book.  Go out and buy the book, read it, and then watch the movie.  Get as much Watchmen as you can.

0743289684|4.0|Ayaan Hirsi Ali has, in less than forty years, managed to live the experiences found in ten life spans.  This celebrated and controversial public figure has worn the hats of many a trade:  that of author, politician, activist, translator, teacher, and secretary.  Born in Somalia to a revolutionary-minded father and fierce-willed mother, Ali saw and lived through events most Westerners only dimly remember from ancient evening news stories.<br /><br />We travel along with her as she recalls the day of her circumcision--which occurred against her father's consent--and the subsequent weeks of pain as her body adjusted.  We sit with her in Islamic-studies class, and watch as she initially attempts to imitate the teachings of the chaste Sister Aziza, before then succumbing to doubt.  We read with gritted teeth--aware of future events yet powerless to prevent them--as she recounts the sense of pervasive fear on the streets on Mogadishu in the days before full-blown clan slaughter began.  We shoulder past thousands of Somalis in an enormous refugee camp, hoping along with Ali that we catch a glimpse of a lost relative among the human morass.  We adjust with her as her parents move from Somalia to Saudi Arabia to Ethiopia to Kenya, learning languages and new customs.  We share her heartbreak as her family is washed away by a series of tragedies.  We lose faith:  in our religion, in belief of God, in the possibility of a love marriage, and in independence.  Finally, we bear witness as she takes her life into her own hands for the first time, escaping into the Netherlands--out of the grasp of suffocating family, clan, and unwanted spouse, and into the pages of history.<br /><br />At face value, \\"Infidel\\" is a memoir of a captivating woman who defeated the bonds of female denigration and dehumanization to become one of the world's most outspoken advocates of equal rights for women.  Her key target is her belief in the misogyny inherent in the Quran, and the causative effects thus seen:  forced marriages, wife beatings which seem more recreational than correctional, the afore-mentioned female circumcision, and \\"honor killings.\\"  An honor killing is the practice by which family regains honor via the murder of a female relation, having first lost it because the woman--be it sister, mother, or daughter--had premarital, extramarital, homosexual, or another such \\"dishonorable\\" sexual encounter.  This can occur regardless of circumstance, including in the setting of rape or incest.  Ms. Ali argues that while most of the above injustices against women are not necessarily exclusive behaviors of Muslim men, they are consistent with Quranic teachings that women are little more the chattel.  Therefore, she argues, it follows that radical Islamic tenants are, among other things, anti-woman at base.<br /><br />As we follow her into Europe, we see her beliefs change as she witnesses how a society primarily made up of non-Muslims is not the chaos she expected.  Buses run on time, houses are immaculately clean, gardens are symmetric bits of paradise, and police officers are there to help, not to bribe.  She is given asylum, a stipend, a job, housing--all much more than she had been taught she would receive at the hands of the \\"godless.\\"  She attends university, attains a degree in political science, becomes an outspoken critic of Islam, and is elected to the Dutch parliament.  As one follows the book, however, one finds that not all immigrants seek naturalization and success as Ali did.  The author makes the disturbing observation that many immigrants bring their old prejudices and traditions with them; thus, ever-expanding pockets of individuals who despise the very tenets of democracy--freedom of speech, freedom of religion, equality--are allowed to thrive within the auspices of the very nation that welcomes them.  Ali notes that the grand irony is that the Netherlands' ideas of democracy are contributing to their own demise:  misogynistic traditions regarding female clothing, discipline, and punishment are allowed to continue under the myopic principles of religious and cultural freedom.  Fear of appearing racist has paralyzed Dutch society to such a degree that it in incapable of doing anything about the inherent hypocrisy:  Dutch democracy is protecting the barbaric traditions of those who would like nothing else than to witness the death of the Netherlands' permissive government.<br /><br />Following these realizations, Ms. Ali decides to become an even more fierce advocate of equal rights and immigrant integration, so she join forces with the inflammatory Dutch filmmaker, Theo van Gogh.  Together they film \\"Submission,\\" a short movie with the abuses suffered by several fictitious Muslim women as its focus.  With that, the snowball which has been gathering mass for so many years finally starts its trek downhill, with deadly results.  Gogh was brutally murdered in the streets of Amsterdam by Mohammed Bouyeri in 2004.  Ali was quickly placed in protective custody following this tragedy.  Enduring constant bodyguard protection, frequent moves designed to mask her true position, and the loss of her position in parliament by opportunistic and cowardly former friends, Ali has yet managed to continue her message:  to be compatible with the modern age, Islam must change, or be changed.<br /><br />This glimpse into one woman's life is very good reading, indeed; however, some ideas are explored excessively, occasionally the bit of redundant rumination shines through, and one gets the impression that too much detail was lavished upon rather unimportant aspects of her childhood and early life in the Netherlands.  Regardless, \\"Infidel\\" is fascinating reading as the memoir, literary magnum opus, and diary of Ayaan Hirsi Ali.  To the average Western citizen, the hardships endured by this woman are simply unimaginable.

B001E1DJD4|5.0|Again [[ASIN:B00022KF1A Happenstance]] i'm speechless ..... to good to be true!  Amazing vocals and the atmosphere is emotional and creepy at the same time.     Listen to it 3 times and the only music you hear this year is Rachael Yamagata!!!!    Greeetz from the netherlands!
B00129H7VS|5.0|There's already enough reviews out there regarding this epic mini-series, so I won't go into details here. I will mainly focus on this Blu-ray package instead.    My cousin owned the DVD version of Band of Brothers and I borrowed it, watched it, and loved it when it first released many years ago. So when the Blu-ray version released, I decided to buy it and watch it ASAP. I was immediately reminded of the super-high production value, special effects, quality acting, story-telling, realism, attention to details, engrossing sound, and emotional aspects that made this mini-series so good.    The Blu-ray version is definitely worth the purchase for anyone wanting to experience one of the best mini-series ever filmed and arguably, the best on-screen depiction of World War II... ever. I was amazed at the picture quality and sound. Most Parts (episodes) have highly-detailed, crisp, and clear images. The only instance where I found some \\"graininess\\" was during the bombardment Easy Company received during Part 7: The Breaking Point. However, this was probably an intended artistic decision choice made by the director and not an issue with the film itself. I personally didn't find it a problem, but I thought I should mention it here. Besides those scenes, most of the episode had near-perfect PQ on a 1080p display.    The sound is just awesome. I don't have a good enough sound system to take advantage of the DTS-HD Master Audio feature, but I do have a system that supports regular DTS audio. You will feel like you're actually there on the battlefield with Easy Company if you turn up the volume, trust me.     The only minor complaint I have is the fact that it takes a while to load up each disc. You have to sit through all the warnings, brief \\"HBO Video\\" introduction (can't skip), and loading session each and every time you pop a disc in. I haven't timed it, but I estimate that it takes roughly 2 minutes to actually view the first episode each disc (2 episodes per disc, 10 episodes total).     The metallic box it comes packaged in is sturdy, just like the DVD version. It is slightly smaller and shaped slightly differently compared to the DVD box, but is very similar to it.     Overall, this is a must-buy product for anyone that likes this genre. If you own a Blu-ray player, you need to get your hands on this boxed set NOW.
B001ED7C5I|3.0|When I say I'm a Tracy Chapman fan, that's an understatement. The last time I saw her was in Tucson for the Westward Swing Vote. She was, once again, amazing. I think I'm simply the fan of Tracy and her guitar. I think her past two albums, Where You Live and Let It Rain are my all time favorites and I haven't loved one of her albums that much since Crossroads. They both left me singing the tunes and every song had such an emotional message that made me think. I was INCREDIBLY excited for Our Bright Future and I can't figure out what happened.    Every song blends into the next and they all sound the same. It has many religious undertones, which is fine if I wanted a Christian album. Her voice is IMMACULATE and still gives me goosebumps. I guess I miss the variety of all her songs on an album. The same thing seems to be said on most of the songs on this album. I do like I Did It All and Conditional but I can't find my place in the others because they all sound the same. This is SO hard for me to say. I guess I miss those heart wrenching and simplistic acoustic songs like The Promise, Be Careful Of My Heart, Don't Dwell, Goodbye, In the Dark, The Love That You Had, or For You. They were greatly missed on this album and that is classic Tracy. I still plan on going wherever she is close to KC but I hope she does much from her past albums. Still love her!
B001GZ6QDS|5.0|This movie leaves you speechless when it's over. The acting is great, the storyline and the character build up is very exciting. The movie is so dark in a sadistic way especially when it comes to the joker. What is scary is how real it is because all the things the joker does could be done to any city, state etc. Its emotional, its fun, and it gets your heart rate going. This is one of my if not my favorite movie of all time! Don't listen to the negatives people put towards this movie. See it for yourself first if you haven't already.
0307265730|5.0|Jhumpa Lahiri is a writer's writer.  These stories are very romantic about missed loves.  She uses stream of consciousness, changes of point of view, description, storytelling, and other writing techniques very well.  I am amazed at her style.  She writes what she knows. She is a Bengali immigrant.  Her characters and stories reflect that heritage.  Her stories contain culture but are not limited to the culture.  She is describing the human condition that is universal to all: A father who is trying to make a new life and trying to make up to a daughter for past ills; a flat-mate who falls in love with another but dares not express that love;  parents that set unrealistic standards for their children. The situations are real and universal.  I learn about the Bengali people but I also learn about life through her writing.  I was expecting a full novel instead of short stories in the first part of the book and a novella in the second part.  She writes about the different garments and dishes but explain them well.  Her purpose is not to do that.  Her purpose is to tell the story and detailed descriptions of the foods and garments would distract.  The reader can always go to Google for more detailed information.  The book kept my focus.  A good read as they say.  But more importantly for me, I found myself smiling at the style and techniques in admiration and jealousy.

B001C46P2A|4.0|\\"Australia\\" may in fact be Baz Luhrmann's most ambitious film, a love story about as epic in scope as the country itself. It's in some ways a departure from his first three films--\\"Strictly Ballroom,\\" \\"William Shakespeare's Romeo + Juliet,\\" and \\"Moulin Rouge\\"--all of which were told in the language of theatrical opulence; \\"Moulin Rouge,\\" for example, was a delightful sight and sound frenzy, with an operatic tragedy set against the backdrop of flashy sets and creative special effects. Even though it took place in 1899 Paris, it's about a time and place that could only exist in the imagination. Now we have \\"Australia,\\" which doesn't go for all-out fantasy but instead pays homage to the period melodramas of yesteryear. It presents us with a fabled but not wholly unrealistic setting, and despite a number of cumbersome details, the plot follows one of the most basic love-story formulas ever conceived of, namely two people from very different worlds falling in love.    Some may criticize this film for its lack of originality. But keep in mind that we're talking about a fable, which is to say that Luhrmann never needed to reinvent the wheel. Every character is a tried and true archetype, and they're part of a story that's essentially a sweeping romance, the likes of which haven't been seen since \\"Gone With the Wind.\\" The sentiment is reflected in the film's cinematography, which is striking to say the least; many shots are majestic bird's-eye views of distant landscapes, all obviously meant to fill every square inch of the broad Cinemascope format. And then there's David Herschfelder's grandiose score, which is clearly evocative of a love that will carry on no matter what. Such a love blooms between an English aristocrat named Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman) and a rugged Australian stockman known only as the Drover (Hugh Jackman); they have virtually nothing in common, yet on a cattle drive across the Outback, they discover that they have feelings for one another.    Allthis is completely expected and very well done. The only real flaw is that, at 165 minutes, the film is too long. Beginning in 1939 at the height of World War II, \\"Australia\\" interweaves a few too many themes and subplots, meaning there always seemed to be a lack of focus. Prim and proper Lady Ashley arrives in Australia to retrieve her husband, who owned a cattle station called Faraway Downs just southwest of a town called Darwin. She inherits the station when she discovers that her husband has been killed. She then learns that a rival group of English cattle barons, led by the wealthy King Carney (Bryan Brown), are plotting to steal her property; Carney relies on a ruthless Australian station manager named Neil Fletcher (David Wenham), a villain in every sense. Faced with the prospect of driving an entire herd of cattle through the Outback, Lady Ashley enlists the help of the Drover, who makes it clear that he only works for commission--no one hires him, and no one fires him.    Tagging along is a half-blooded Aborigine boy named Nullah (Brandon Walters), who doubles as the film's narrator. His inclusion represents Luhrmann's personal disapproval of Australia's former racial policies, specifically the forced enslavement and brainwashing of Aboriginal children (which, appallingly, wasn't stopped until 1973). It's quite possible he made this film partially in response to the fact that his government formally apologized to indigenous peoples this year. A well-rounded social commentary to be sure, although I can't help but wonder how relevant it is given the fact that the film is, above all, a classic period drama. Still, Nullah takes part in some of the film's best moments, not the least of which is a beautiful scene featuring Lady Ashley telling him the story of \\"The Wizard of Oz.\\" Watching their feelings for one another grow was certainly satisfying; for all intents and purposes, she becomes his mother by the end of the film.    Nullah also was a nice counterpartto his grandfather (David Gulpilil), a wise and mysterious Aborigine who is both a spiritual guide and a physical protector. It may seem he has the ability to appear and disappear at will, although it's more likely that such moments represent Nullah's state of mind. Because he often yearns for his grandfather, it's almost as if he's right there with him.    As with \\"Moulin Rouge\\" and \\"Romeo + Juliet,\\" \\"Australia\\" begins in the spirit of good fun, only to grow more and more serious. By the time we reach the final forty-five minutes or so, the Japanese have begun bombing the country, which puts Lady Ashley, the Drover, and Nullah in an entirely new dramatic situation. It becomes less of a western and more of a war drama. As with the rest of the film, the climactic last act was visually splendid and wonderfully structured. There was, however, a creeping sense that it belonged in a different film, which is worrisome considering the skill employed by the filmmakers. But in no way does it ruin the entire experience. Despite some length, focus, and pacing issues, \\"Australia\\" is a stirring film, at times fun, at times touching, always adhering to the traditions that defined some of our more famous Hollywood romance stories. For characters that are deliberately broad, the actors give very enjoyable performances. It was especially nice to watch Jackman, who has so rarely been allowed to use his natural accent. And as for Kidman, well, the fact that she's such a talented actress should tell you everything.
0823015033|5.0|If you're interested in sculpting in polymer clay, there's really no excuse for not having Katherine's book on your shelf. This book is clearly written, with great photographs and tons of invaluable information, from making our own tools to basic anatomy and proportions to the distinctions of race, ethnicity, and age.     I doubt that there's anybody who knows more about sculpting with polymer clays such as Sculpey and Fimo, and this book gives you all the information you need to get started, including precise information about the relative masses of various body parts and lots of techniques for accomplishing common tasks.    I initially avoided this book, thinking it was a book about making fairies, which didn't appeal to me. I had the opportunity to look through a friend's copy at one point, and realized I was depriving myself of a great resource for foolish reason. I bought the book the next day. As long as you're interested in sculpting humans, or human-like figures using polymer clay, this book is a must-have for you.
0307236722|5.0|I read this book looking for ways to WOW my guests with my baking. There are plenty of ideas, pictures and instructions in this book. I am a fairly good cook and do not need instructions on producing the \\"basic\\" baked goods. I wanted to find new tools like the cannelle mold and new ways to use the mundane like using a stainless steel bowl to make a birthday cake (with piped meringue frosting browned with a brulee torch). Now you are talking my language. That is what I look for in Martha's magazines and books. I am not actually a fan, I find her kind of annoying to listen to but she has great ideas & photographs. Buy this book if you want to take the 'next step' don't bother if you are simply looking for new ways to use cake mix.
0553582038|5.0|After coming to the end of the book, the author states that he originally planned for this and the forthcoming \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" to be in the same book, but due to the size of it, he was forced to split the books into two.  \\"A Feast for Crows\\" veers from the path beaten by the previous three books in the series, as not all the characters we have come to know and love (or hate) have points of view.  We are not privy to exactly what is happening at and beyond the Wall or in the fart east.  Some events in these places are hinted at in conversations between characters, though the full story is never truly heard, just bits and pieces.  New territories are explored and new characters introduced, which serves its purpose, but also is cause for some of the backlash towards this book.  Some old favorites are still there and their stories are captivating as always.    Personally, I thoroughly enjoyed this book as it gave a different point of view of the kingdom, progressed the story along, and laid the foundation for bigger and better things yet to come.  I would not look at this book as a sequel to \\"A Storm of Swords\\", and those expecting the same level of suspense, scheming, and twists might be a little let down.  This book seems to be akin to taking a deep breath after the all out assault that was the third book.  That is not to say that this book does not have its moments though.  I hope that all readers of the series will overlook the negative things they have heard about \\"A Feast for Crows\\" and read it for yourself.  This was not my favorite book of the series, but it is still A Song of Ice and Fire, which at least for me, is a good thing.  In my opinion, regardless of the overall feeling towards the book, it is a must read for any fan of the series, though I can understand wanting to wait until \\"A Dance with Dragons\\" is closer to being finished before diving in!
B001GQACGO|3.0|Now I realize that Beyonce's first album was a flook.  You would think after Dangerously In Love she would be able to carry that kind of talent and creativity through to the next level of her career.  I thought B'day was a dissapointment and now, Sasha Fierce trumps that with this travesty.  I don't know what's going on with Beyonce.  Her music has hit a wall and become souless, dull and ordinary.  Where is the magic from her first album?  Alot of her upbeat music follows that same formula with the fast talking and attitude from hell. The song \\"Diva\\" is unlistenable and annoying like most of the tracks on B'Day.  When I was playing the cd in my car, my eyes were glazed over as I was driving, and music is NOT supposed to do that to you.  the only high point was when I was blasting \\"Video Phone\\".  The bass is always turned up in my car so the song had a cool effect by making my seat and my whole car vibrate.  But then an old man next to me in his car heard the music blasting out my window and he screamed  \\"turn that f-ing garbage down!!!\\" so it ruined the moment.  The ballad cd was a skip-over parade.  It's as if I couldn't wait to skip over to the next track as each new song started.  the only song, I repeat THE ONLY song I liked off that disc was \\"Ave Maria\\", which is the best song on the whole deluxe edition.  That's pretty sad, and ironically it's not a completely original song it's a borderline remake.  The only other noteworthy song on the cd is \\"scared of lonely\\".  And I still wonder how could this be?  Beyonce tried to do this cross-over \\"coldplay\\" type music that just does not work for her.  She should stick to r and b, real r and b.  Beyonce needs to re- think what direction she wants to go artistically and work with all new writers and producers.  Re-team with the Dangerously In Love crew!
055357342X|5.0|I tore through this series, and while I would obviously recommend all the books, as they are essential to progressing the tale, A Storm of Swords seemed to stand above the others just slightly.  I will not get into spoilers, as I would have hated to been spoiled on some of the plot twists that occur (there are quite a few!).  I will say that at one point in the book I couldn't get to sleep because my heart was pounding so hard from the dismay and utter disbelief of what turn the plot took.  A Storm of Swords is one of those books that you will pick-up to read before bed, look at the clock, and suddenly it is 3am in the morning... which seems like a great time for just one more chapter.  If you have made it this far in the series, you owe it to yourself to pick-up this book, and continue on the epic journey through Westeros, the far east, and beyond the Wall.

0553381687|5.0|Not normally a fantasy reader, I was skeptical when a friend recommended this book (and series) to me.  I put off reading it for some time, but finally ordered the book.  I struggled through the first 100 or so pages of A Game of Thrones and it was on the verge of getting lost in the pile of never to be completed novels I have lying around.  Luckily, something \\"clicked\\" once I got past the initial setup of the novel and I became truly hooked.<br /><br />George R.R. Martin paints an amazing tale of a medieval time, set in a fictional world.  The story advances through the points of view of various characters scattered throughout the enormous world.  This allows for the reader to become close to some characters, while coming to despise others.  This makes their downfalls or triumphs that much more satisfying or heart retching.<br /><br />A Game of Thrones takes a more realistic path, as opposed to something like Lord of the Rings, initially, but the seeds have been planted for fantasy elements to emerge, and by the end of the novel, they begin to sprout.  I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a well written novel that has twists, turns, and everything in between.  By the time I got three-quarters of the way through this book, I placed an order for the next three books in the series, so I wouldn't have to wait to start them.  Though they are long, it is not a chore like some bloated novels, but is truly captivating from cover to cover.
0316017922|5.0|Few books cause me to think differently about the world. This book did. I can't stop talking about it. (Just ask my wife.) Bestselling author Malcolm Gladwell has gifted us with an absolutely fascinating book that will make you think, ponder, discuss and wonder.  He asserts, \\"I will argue that there is something profoundly wrong with the way we make sense of success.\\"<br /><br />The author continues, \\"The culture we belong to and the legacies passed down by our forebears shape the patterns of our achievement in ways we cannot begin to imagine.  It's not enough to ask what successful people are like, in other words. It is only by asking where they are from that we can unravel the logic behind who succeeds and who doesn't.\\"<br /><br />Titled \\"Outliers,\\" the book defines an outlier as \\"something that is situated away from or classed differently from a main or related body.\\" And with one fast-reading example after another, story teller/commentator-on-life Gladwell is off and running.<br /><br />Why are Asian students seemingly more successful at math? Go back to the rice paddies and observe the rigorous work ethic. Why do college students in the south get more rattled when confronted? Check out their Scottish and Irish ancestors and their \\"culture of honor.\\" After an alarming number of airline crashes on the formerly named Korean Airlines, how and why did management change the culture of the cockpit?  (Don't read \\"The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes\\" chapter at 30,000 feet, as I did last week. Yikes!)<br /><br />What does the \\"Matthew Effect\\" (per the first book of the New Testament) have to do with hockey players born in January? Teachers, parents and grandparents will be amazed at his data on I.Q., education and school vacations--the U.S. school year is 180 days long. Japan's is 243 days.<br /><br />You will insist that Gladwell's conclusions cannot possibly be true. Are they? You'll sense sadness at how we fail to understand culture--and the incredible harm of wasted years and lives--all preventable, claims the author. He makes a compelling case about luck, timing--and the extraordinary power of the 10,000-hour rule and how it contributed to the success of Bill Gates and the Beatles.<br /><br />Read the book and then host a team discussion on the vast implications for your organization, such as what to consider when recruiting new team members and how professional development programs might need to change based on a person's ethnicity. For example, Greeks and Guatemalans are in the top five of the \\"uncertainty avoidance\\" countries (high reliance on rules), while Swedes and Jamaicans represent the top-five cultures best able to tolerate ambiguity.<br /><br />On work, Gladwell writes, \\"Those three things--autonomy, complexity, and a connection between effort and reward--are, most people agree, the three qualities that work has to have if it is to be satisfying.\\"  I would add leveraging your strengths, as discussed in the Team Bucket, one of 20 competencies in my book, [[ASIN:0830745947 Mastering The Management Buckets: 20 Critical Competencies for Leading Your Business or Non-profit]].aims the author.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|This movie was so funny and Wall.E is so cute the animators have done a brilliant job of making this movie i would say one of the best animations since shrek. The sound effects are great with there being no dialogue within the first 30 mins of the movie everyone finds themselves focusing in on the sounds of others. Its a fantastic movie and you will fall in love with Wall.E in the first 5 mins of the movie.

B001DTPZNY|2.0|I love the Indiana Jones movies and really looked forward to another in the series. I am beginning to seriously think that Spielberg and Lucas are living off their reputation or are legends in their own minds. Neither has made a decent movie in quite awhile. After I watched it a second time (theater first, dvd second), my disappointment really became apparent. What I overlooked the first time became painfully obvious during the second viewing. Harrison Ford is an excellent actor but somebody forgot to do his makeup and he looked very old. Too old for some of the action he was supposed to be doing.   The biggest problem is that the basic premise/plot for this movie doesn't really make sense. The previous three Indiana Jones movies at least had a slight plausibility and realism though it takes a stretch to get there. This one was way too far gone and reminded me of some of the B-Movie clones of Indiana Jones. If you are a fan, you will be disappointed. If you have to see it, borrow a copy, don't waste your own money on it.
B001L7NWQA|4.0|Good album. Certainly mixes blues, 80's alternative, and some ambiant material in some mixture that never comes out as a clear distinction. Part of that is to its advantage as its something unusual and keeps one listening. The other part is to its disadvantage due to its variability causing a bit of a difficult flow in the overall album from start to finish. Some songs work great, others dont. But thats usually the way Macca is. But Macca does keep trying something new and that in itself is always respectable.
B0011XW74W|5.0|There is a lot to be learned from The Shock Doctrine; in its pages one may discover many of the whys behind recent events. For example, I was mystified as to why President Bush could sink so low as to veto a bill forbidding torture. Now I understand that veto, albeit I certainly can't condone it. Torture is a major tool used to destroy someone's ability to comprehend what is going on while control of his or her property, and/or  means of livelihood is being turned over to someone more influential.     The facts Naomi Klein reveals will make you angry, and sad, and ashamed.     There is the little-known story of why, in Iraq, we snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, by suppressing the Iraqis' spontaneous excercise of democracy, replacing the representative bodies they elected with unrepresentative bodies appointed by Paul Bremer.     There is the story of why Federal aid after Katrina was delayed and misdirected, so that New Orleans' city government could be almost completely privatized.    And there is the story of the evil genius behind all of this and more, the mild-mannered Dr. Milton Friedman, late leading member of the economics department of the University of Chicago, whose public words were gentle and humanitarian, but whose private advice to dictators such as General Augusto Pinochet were more reminiscent of Dr. Josef Mengele of Aushwitz, except that Dr. Mengele didn't even appear mild-mannered; perhaps a better comparison would be to Oscar St. Just.     Several have commented that one should read Johan Norberg's critique of Klein. I have read it and found it worthless. It consists solely of unsupported assertions, whereas Klein cites her sources with 74 pages of notes (more than 10% of the entire book).     Norberg begins: \\"Naomi Klein's The Shock Doctrine purports to be an expose of the ruthless nature of free-market capitalism and its chief recent exponent, Milton Friedman.\\" [Norberg correctly put 'The Shock Doctrine' in italics, which Amazon's text box does not permit] But Klein's book does not purport to be an expose of free-market capitalism; she does not claim that free-market capitalism is inherently ruthless or evil. What she amply demonstrates is the ruthlessness of a particular variety of free-market capitalism which she calls disaster capitalism, or Friedmanism, after its late leading exponent.     Norberg writes: \\"Klein's analysis is hopelessly flawed at virtually every level.\\" but it is Norberg's critique that is hopelessly flawed. Norberg seems to be, to borrow a phrase from Eric Flint, 'logically challenged.' He writes: \\"Friedman's own words reveal him to be an advocate of peace, democracy, and individual rights. He argued that gradual economic reforms were OFTEN preferable to swift ones and that the public should be fully informed about them, . . .\\" [emphasis added] And whose own words revealed him to be a fervent advocate of freedom, which he extolled in almost every speech? Why, none other than the late Adolf Hitler! Also, what is often true is not necessarily always true. There is no logical inconsistency between \\"gradual reforms are often preferable\\" and \\"these circumstances (e.g. strong popular opposition) require that changes be made swiftly, without informing the public until it is too late to stop them\\"     Norberg writes: \\"Klein's historical examples also fall apart under scrutiny. For example, Klein alleges that the Tiananmen Square crackdown was intended to crush opposition to pro-market reforms, when in fact it caused liberalization to stall for years.\\" Even if the consequences of the crackdown were as Norberg claims, that in no way disproves what Klein said about its intention. (Could it be that Norberg has led such a sheltered life that he has never heard of unintended consequences?)     Norberg goes on to write: \\"She also argues that Thatcher used the Falklands War as cover for her unpopular economic policies, when actually those economic policies and their results enjoyed strong public support. It is Norberg's argument, not Klein's historical example, that falls apart under scrutiny. On page 168, Klein writes: \\". . . by 1982, the number of unemployed had doubled under [Thatcher's] watch, as had the inflation rate. She had tried to take on one of the most powerful unions in the country, the coal miners, and had failed. After three years in office, Thatcher saw her personal approval rating drop to only 25 percent . . . .\\" But then came the Falklands war. On page 170, Klein writes: \\"From a military standpoint, the eleven-week battle appears to have almost no historical significance. Overlooked, however, was the war's impact on the free-market project, which was enormous: it was the Falklands war that gave Thatcher the political cover she needed to bring a program of radical Capitalist transformation to a Western liberal democracy for the first time.\\" And yes, the Falklands victory did give her strong public support that enabled her to get her proposals enacted, and that support continued for a short while afterwards, until the public had time to experience the full effects of Thatcher's 'reforms' and realize how badly they had been snookered. Norberg deceptively implies that the 'strong public support' was there all along, but it wasn't.       But at least there is some hope. As we see in the final chapter, there is hope: shock wears off, and some of those who survive have a tendency to trade places with their oppressors, putting the oppressors in jail and returning their country to the people.     watziznaym@gmail.com
B001IRUCFM|5.0|A rather strange album that demands multiple listen throughs.  Not really an MTV-style \\"listen to these 3 tracks...\\" type of album, but something that should be enjoyed start to finish, over and over again.  Buy it: I mean really, 8 bucks is a rather small price to pay in order to support an artist and tell them they're on the right track and keep doing what they're doing.
B0009A40ES|1.0|This movie was terrible.  Barely a plot, horrible acting.  I don't know what all the humdrum was about.  I hated it.
B001FB4W0W|5.0|If there is one television show that you watch on dvd or watch religiously it should be this. True Blood is so different and a breathe of fresh air. It definitely is not your stereotypical vampire show.
B0012IWHDW|5.0|I've owned maybe six copies of this album & they all disappeared (to New Mexico?) when I loaned 'em out in late-party generosity.  So I again bought a copy & will not loan this'un!  But the music is haunting, \\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door,\\" though covered my many, never sounded this good.  The film (Pechinpah) is finally beginning to get serious attention amongst the DVD bunch & the music fits most any element.  A must for any Dylan collection.  Great price, too.
B001A3AA0G|5.0|Heard a snippet of this album on WFUV.org - fantastic college radio station.  The song White Winter Hymnal immediately caught my ear but I missed the name of the artist and song.  Luckily I heard it again the following day and made note of the name. I went to the band's website and heard more.  I was astounded!  Clearly, openly, and lovingly influenced by 60's pop sounds and harmonies of the Beach Boys, Simon & Garfunkle, John Lennon, and so many more (all thanked in the liner notes), this young band takes those sounds as a foundation and weave their own modern sound into them.  As a baby boomer myself who grew up on those 60's artists, I can tell you that this band - and it's lead singer/songwriter Robin Pecknold - are worthy heirs to those familiar icons.  Fame cannot be far off for these young guys with so much originality and obvious love of many different syles of music.  This album is wonderful, and I've been recommending it to everyone I talk to!
B001ED7C5I|5.0|What can i say aobut this amazing artist.  Her lyrics, music, are some of the best tested around.  If you are a Tracy fan you will love/like this album.  I recommend it.  I to think this album is alittle sad in tone so I hope that she is enjoying and experiencing life to the fullest.
B001EO2UJK|5.0|I suppose the negative reviews complaining about compression and loss of dynamics are based on the CDs (side note: I wish reviewers indicated better what version they're basing their opinions on). Personally, I have not bothered listening to the CDs, opting for the 5.1 surround sound versions of these fantastic albums. and I don't hear any significant compression artifacts. The surround sound mixes have made gorgeous music even better! If you have a surround sound system and are a Genesis fan, you may safely purchase these. Especially if you, like me, enjoyed the two box sets released earlier; I think the surround sound makes a bigger difference on the earlier than on the later albums.    As with the previous box sets (1976-1982 and 1983-1998), the surround mixes often allow you to hear numerous things you never heard before. For instance, I can now clearly hear *both* acoustic guitars during the verses of \\"The Lamia\\" (my all-time favorite Genesis song), whereas earlier I could only hear one.     That said, occasionally there are things \\"missing\\" in these mixes. A few examples: the flute during the fadeout of \\"The Lamia\\" is now inaudible. The nasty \\"tearing\\" or \\"ripping\\" sound when Raels penis is cut off in \\"The Colony of Slipperman\\" is missing (and I've always thought of this sound as integral to the story!). During part of the keyboard section of \\"Riding the Scree\\" (the section that would later resurface in live versions of \\"The Cinema Show\\"; i.e., the section that follows \\"here I go...\\"), what used to be the primary melody has been pushed in the background, in favor of what used to be the accompanying melody, giving the illusion of a different melody altogether. Finally, there are moments throughout this box set when the bass guitar is too far in the background for my taste (this also goes for the 1976-1982 and 1983-1998 box sets). Overall, these are relatively minor complaints, and I think Nick Davis and Genesis have made spectacular surround sound versions of their music, and I'm very, very grateful to them!    Now, let's hope for a box set with the live albums! Genesis Live, Seconds Out, Three Sides Live, The Way We Walk, and the stuff in the Archive box sets (including the entire Lamb!) would all sound fantastic in 5.1.    As an aside, the interviews are quite fun. They're much longer than the ones included in the previous box sets (which were about 15 minutes each, while this time around they are about 45 minutes each). We get to hear from all band members, including Ant Philips. My favorite moment is when Phil Collins talks fondly about \\"The Waiting Room\\" ... (!)
B001ED7C58|4.0|I have been waiting for this to come out for awhile, when I first listened to it I was initially disappointed. After listening to it several times over the last couple weeks I am now a fan. I didn't like bellas lullaby at first because in my opinion (like many others) it should just be a piano piece but i have to admit I like the song itself it just doesn't fit with expectations. I appreciate the soundtrack much more after seeing the movie.  I really like Paramore's I caught myself, Pattinson's Never think, Spotlight Mutemath and All the way into the twilight by Farrell
B001FB4W0W|4.0|I'm not sure that any good series on the supernatural has ever tried as hard to be simply good fun.  It isn't the masterpiece that BUFFY THE VAMPIRE SLAYER was, but I don't think Alan Ball set his sights that high.  While Joss Whedon strove in BUFFY to create an icon and redefine television narrative, Ball just seems to want to tell a compelling story filled with memorable moments.<br /><br />TRUE BLOOD is, of course, based on the series of novels written by Arkansas writer Charlaine Harris.  The series was originally known as the Southern Vampire Mysteries, but has since come to be better known as The Sookie Stackhouse novels.  The premise is that a Japanese corporation has successfully created artificial blood, a product so like the real thing that vampires, previously relegated to feeding off humans in the dark, come \\"out of the coffin\\" and into society, intent on living off the new fake blood.  The series' title comes from the name of the artificial blood marketed and sold in stores.  The television series wisely does not try to hew too closely to the novels, though for the most part Sookie's story does.  And the way things turn at the end of the season, it is clear that Season Two (the show was renewed very early in the season) is going to pick up with the second novel in the series, though the action most likely will be in Bon Temps and not in Dallas (the second novel is entitled LIVING DEAD IN DALLAS).<br /><br />The major difference between the novels and the TV series is that while the novels focus almost entirely on Sookie, the series has elevated a number of secondary characters and padded out their story.  The focus on Sookie in the books is inevitable given that she is the narrator.  But since few shows attempt to tell a story primarily from one character's point of view (an exception is Season One of VERONICA MARS, in which the title character features in very nearly every scene), elevating several characters was a necessity.  Tara is a very minor character in the books (and white to boot), but on the show she is black and one of the most important characters.  Sookie's brother Jason is a moderately important character in the books, but definitely not as central as Bill, Eric, or Sam.  Tara was promoted on the show partly to balance out the show in terms of race and gender.  I'm not quite sure why Jason was made more important.  The story arcs that are given to these characters are not always successful, but they do give the show some diversity.  Lafayette, Tara's flamboyantly gay cousin and short order cook at Merlotte's, the tavern where Sookie is a barmaid, likewise is a major character on the TV series, but barely makes an appearance in the novels.<br /><br />I'm not always comfortable with the additions the show makes to the story and they usually are the weakest part of the show.  For instance, the long story of Tara's mother and her demon possession is an addition that I feel clutters the show, even as it raises the question of why Tara herself struggles with relationships.  The character of Amy, who is weirdly involved with Jason in the latter half of the season, sits on the rest of the story like a weird, disconnected appendage.  In fact, the entire obsession with V (or vampire blood, which is taken like a drug) is unique to the show and not the books, I think to the show's detriment.  Terry Bellefleur is a slightly more important character in the series, and about 20-30 years younger (and played by Todd Lowe, who played Zack, Lane's band mate/boyfriend/husband in THE GILMORE GIRLS), and a veteran of the Gulf War instead of the Vietnam War.  I don't expect for a show to be especially true to its source material.  I don't look for a scene-by-scene recreation.  But I do think that the additions show actually add something of value to the story.  All in all, I do not think the completely original aspects improved the overall story.<br /><br />There is a lot of controversy on boards where fans of the books linger about Anna Paquin.  Physically she isn't quite like how Sookie is described in the books, where she is far curvier and extremely busty.  I personally love Anna Paquin's performance.  She has a haunted, hunted look that someone who has had to struggle for years of hearing the thoughts of others might have.  She does very much seem to embody \\"Crazy Sookie,\\" as she is known to everyone in Bon Temps.  I also like all the actors who played the three other major characters from the books, Stephen Moyer as Bill, Alexander Skarsgaard as Eric (who will, given his stature as an actor and the precedent of the books, become a more important character in Season Two -- and let me just add, could anyone have been found more perfect to play Eric?), and Sam Trammell as Sam Merlotte.  My favorite performer to play a major role on the show but a minor one in the books is Nelsan Ellis, who also had a recurring role on the sadly short-lived THE INSIDE and was on an excellent episode of VERONICA MARS, and who on TRUE BLOOD plays Lafayette.  Though I have to add that he is s completely unbelievable character.  I've lived three years in a town not terribly distinct from Bon Temps and I can assert that you simply will not find many if any openly gay people and definitely not one a flamboyant one.<br /><br />All in all I really enjoyed the series TRUE BLOOD, though on the one hand I prefer the books (and I strongly recommend anyone who loves TRUE BLOOD to give the books a try, though I also warn them that the show does seem to be following to a greater or lesser degree the books -- Season Two is already set up to follow many of the second novel's storylines) and on the other I prefer Alan Ball's earlier show SIX FEET UNDER.  Still, it is a good, fun show.<br /><br />And can I just add that this show has my all time favorite opening credits.  It is filled with one astonishing image after another, from a coiled water moccasin to a Holy Ghost inspired preacher doing a 180 jump in church to lasciviously dancing strippers, all to a wonderfully appropriate song by country performer Jace Everett entitled \\"Bad Things.\\"ysically she isn't quite like how Sookie is described in the books, where she is far curvier and extremely busty.

B000OY8NII|4.0|We took a chance and ordered the \\"Eureka - Season One\\" set without ever having seen an episode on TV. We found Eureka to be a very entertaining Sci-Fi series, complete with a strong cast, great writing, and good use of humor and action. We watch this together (son 12, daughter 16, wife 47, me 44) and only once or twice found an \\"adult\\" situation that we made our son close his eyes for (really not bad).<br /><br />One of the best parts of the series is the time spent on strong character development, it did seem to get the series off to a slightly slow start but it was worth it as the show progressed. By the end of the first season, the characters are fully fleshed out and very \\"real\\".<br /><br />This is a very funny and smart series! Highly recommended!
B006BG7RI0|5.0|\\"Casablanca\\" is a motion picture classic beloved by millions.  Warner Home Video has honored this wartime romantic drama with an elaborate box set to commemorate the 70th anniversary of its theatrical release.<br /><br />World War II is raging and the Nazis are occupying North Africa, but Rick Blaine (Humphrey Bogart) is sitting out the war in Casablanca as proprietor of the most popular nightclub in town.  The cynical Rick comes into possession of two letters of transit permitting their carriers to leave the country.  To placate Nazi Major Strasser (Conrad Veidt), local police Captain Renault (Claude Rains) detains Czech underground leader Victor Laszlo (Paul Henreid), who is accompanied by Ilsa (Ingrid Bergman), Rick's former love.  Old flames are rekindled and Rick plans use the letters of transit to leave Casablanca with Ilsa.<br /><br />The film could have turned out to be a standard wartime drama, but everything clicked:  Michael Curtiz's direction; a fresh and clever script; colorful characters; the chemistry between Bogart and Bergman; a first-class supporting cast (Rains, Peter Lorre, Sydney Greenstreet, Dooley Wilson); a haunting song, \\"As Time Goes By,\\" that runs through the film as Rick and Ilsa's love theme; and the immediacy of a war whose outcome was still undetermined.<br /><br />Humphrey Bogart, who had previously played gangsters, took on his first romantic lead in \\"Casablanca.\\"  George Raft had unsuccessfully angled for the role of Rick.  Ingrid Bergman, under contract at the time to David O. Selznick, was borrowed by Jack Warner to co-star with Bogart.  Composer Max Steiner was against using \\"As Time Goes By\\" and Warner finally agreed to let him write an original song for the movie, but by then Bergman had cut her hair for another movie and couldn't re-shoot the scenes in which the song was heard.  Sam, Rick's singer-pianist, who performs the song, was nearly made a female, with Hazel Scott, Lena Horne, and Ella Fitzgerald considered for the role.  Dooley Wilson, the eventual Sam, was a drummer and faked playing the piano.<br /><br />No movie has more memorable dialogue.  \\"Here's looking at you, kid\\" was voted as the Number 5 most famous movie quote by the American Film Institute.  Other lines that live in memory include \\"We'll always have Paris,\\" \\"Round up the usual suspects,\\" \\"The problems of two people don't amount to a hill of beans in this world,\\" and \\"I think this is the beginning of a beautiful friendship.\\"  But Bogie never spoke the line \\"Play it again Sam.\\"  That was the title of Woody Allen's 1972 homage to \\"Casablanca.\\"  Rather, Rick says to Sam, who had performed the song at Ilsa's request, \\"You played it for her.  You can play it for me.\\"<br /><br />The 3-Disc 70th Anniversary Edition box set contains Blu-ray and DVD versions, reproduction of the original 1942 French film poster, 60-page production art book, and collectible drink coaster set.  Among the 14 hours of bonus material are two new documentaries: \\"Casablanca: An Unlikely Classic\\" and a look at the career of director Michael Curtiz; full-length documentaries on the history of Warner Brothers Studio and its founders; outtakes; a vintage cartoon; two radio broadcasts; several short subjects; audio commentary by Roger Ebert; and an introduction by Lauren Bacall.
B0017ZB8M6|4.0|This cd is pretty great for a debut album. Katy Perry knows her direction and she has her own style, and thats WAY BETTER than the other generic teenage pop stars who just pops pops pops.     Highlights of this album are (in order): Hot & Cold, Lost, I Kissed A Girl, One of The Boys, Ur So Gay, Waking Up in Vegas.    Recommended.
0425223523|4.0|Amanda Grange's writing style is always very pleasant to read and this book was no different. She continues her theme of writing some of Jane Austen's stories from the hero's point of view, supposedly in diary form (although I doubt any gentlemen of that era would have written diaries quite like these!)<br /><br />Captain Wentworth is the hero of 'Persuasion', a book which starts eight years after the characters had first met, become engaged, broken the engagement and moved on to separate lives. In Amanda Grange's book almost half of the text is given up to that time in 1806 when Wentworth and Miss Anne Elliot first meet and fall in love. We see how they meet each other, how they get to spend a little time with each other and how Wentworth gradually begins to realise the value of Anne and that she and he have compatible minds and ideas. The second half of the book follows Austen's story from Wentworth's point of view with many scenes and dialogue the same and others extended. Much less attention is paid in this book to some of the other characters (for example the younger Mr Elliot) and in fact the book seems to go by quite quickly.<br /><br />Although we are reading events and feelings written by Captain Wentworth I didn't feel I knew him any better after this book than I had from reading Austen's one, and Anne less so. However the story was very enjoyable to read, even if one knew how it would end, and I didn't feel the author took any liberties with Austen's ideas. There were a few little slips into American English (the verb 'to quit' was used a few times and the concept of 'visiting with' someone used in a non-English way) but mostly this was a very successful read and one that would appeal to most Austen fans, particularly those who would have liked to know how Wentworth and Anne Elliot first got to know each other.<br /><br />Originally published for Curled Up With A Good Book © Helen Hancox 2008

The premise is that a Japanese corporation has successfully created artificial blood, a product so like the real thing that vampires, previously relegated to feeding off humans in the dark, come \\"out of the coffin\\" and into society, intent on living off the new fake blood.  The series' title comes from the name of the artificial blood marketed and sold in stores.  The television series wisely does not try to hew too closely to the novels, though for the most part Sookie's story does.  And the way things turn at the end of the season, it is clear that Season Two (the show was renewed very early in the season) is going to pick up with the second novel in the series, though the action most likely will be in Bon Temps and not in Dallas (the second novel is entitled LIVING DEAD IN DALLAS).<br /><br />The major difference between the novels and the TV series is that while the novels focus almost entirely on Sookie, the series has elevated a number of secondary characters and padded out their story.  The focus on Sookie in the books is inevitable given that she is the narrator.  But since few shows attempt to tell a story primarily from one character's point of view (an exception is Season One of VERONICA MARS, in which the title character features in very nearly every scene), elevating several characters was a necessity.  Tara is a very minor character in the books (and white to boot), but on the show she is black and one of the most important characters.  Sookie's brother Jason is a moderately important character in the books, but definitely not as central as Bill, Eric, or Sam.  Tara was promoted on the show partly to balance out the show in terms of race and gender.  I'm not quite sure why Jason was made more important.  The story arcs that are given to these characters are not always successful, but they do give the show some diversity.  Lafayette, Tara's flamboyantly gay cousin and short order cook at Merlotte's, the tavern where Sookie is a barmaid, likewise is a major character on the TV series, but barely makes an appearance in the novels.<br /><br />I'm not always comfortable with the additions the show makes to the story and they usually are the weakest part of the show.  For instance, the long story of Tara's mother and her demon possession is an addition that I feel clutters the show, even as it raises the question of why Tara herself struggles with relationships.  The character of Amy, who is weirdly involved with Jason in the latter half of the season, sits on the rest of the story like a weird, disconnected appendage.  In fact, the entire obsession with V (or vampire blood, which is taken like a drug) is unique to the show and not the books, I think to the show's detriment.  Terry Bellefleur is a slightly more important character in the series, and about 20-30 years younger (and played by Todd Lowe, who played Zack, Lane's band mate/boyfriend/husband in THE GILMORE GIRLS), and a veteran of the Gulf War instead of the Vietnam War.  I don't expect for a show to be especially true to its source material.  I don't look for a scene-by-scene recreation.  But I do think that the additions show actually add something of value to the story.  All in all, I do not think the completely original aspects improved the overall story.<br /><br />There is a lot of controversy on boards where fans of the books linger about Anna Paquin.  Physically she isn't quite like how Sookie is described in the books, where she is far curvier and extremely busty.  I personally love Anna Paquin's performance.  She has a haunted, hunted look that someone who has had to struggle for years of hearing the thoughts of others might have.  She does very much seem to embody \\"Crazy Sookie,\\" as she is known to everyone in Bon Temps.  I also like all the actors who played the three other major characters from the books, Stephen Moyer as Bill, Alexander Skarsgaard as Eric (who will, given his stature as an actor and the precedent of the books, become a more important character in Season Two -- and let me just add, could anyone have been found more perfect to play Eric?), and Sam Trammell as Sam Merlotte.  My favorite performer to play a major role on the show but a minor one in the books is Nelsan Ellis, who also had a recurring role on the sadly short-lived THE INSIDE and was on an excellent episode of VERONICA MARS, and who on TRUE BLOOD plays Lafayette.  Though I have to add that he is s completely unbelievable character.  I've lived three years in a town not terribly distinct from Bon Temps and I can assert that you simply will not find many if any openly gay people and definitely not one a flamboyant one.<br /><br />All in all I really enjoyed the series TRUE BLOOD, though on the one hand I prefer the books (and I strongly recommend anyone who loves TRUE BLOOD to give the books a try, though I also warn them that the show does seem to be following to a greater or lesser degree the books -- Season Two is already set up to follow many of the second novel's storylines) and on the other I prefer Alan Ball's earlier show SIX FEET UNDER.  Still, it is a good, fun show.<br /><br />And can I just add that this show has my all time favorite opening credits.  It is filled with one astonishing image after another, from a coiled water moccasin to a Holy Ghost inspired preacher doing a 180 jump in church to lasciviously dancing strippers, all to a wonderfully appropriate song by country performer Jace Everett entitled \\"Bad Things.\\"ysically she isn't quite like how Sookie is described in the books, where she is far curvier and extremely busty.

B000TGCR38|5.0|\\"Black Book\\"  is the story of  Rachel Stein (Clarice van Houten),  a beautiful Jewish woman hiding out in Holland from the Nazis.  When her plan to escape goes terribly wrong,  she manages to take on a new identity, work for the Dutch Resistance, and infiltrate the enemy.  But working for the enemy takes its toll when both sides turn against her.  Directed by Paul Verhoeven, \\"Black Book\\" is an exciting, beautifully crafted World War II thriller.  The script is always way ahead of the viewer as it takes unexpected twists and turns along the way.  Van Houten is excellent, and the movie has the look of an expensive Hollywood epic, despite its far more modest budget.  The movie is fast paced, and contains plenty of action, but it's the story of Rachel that remains central.

0670020745|2.0|I had a difficult time with this book.  This book was selected by my book discussion group, so I had to read it. It was very tedious and I felt as if this was required reading for a class. I understood a little of the first part about how the brain works. That was good.  I was told by a friend that the book becomes more intersting during and after Jill Bolte Taylor's stroke. It didn't. How could Taylor remember what was happening while she was having a stroke?  I still don't understand what she was talking about when she talks of \\"fluidity\\" . This could have been a great story about recovery.  Taylor mentions that she relearned to drive a car. I was interested on the techniques she used to relearn this skill. I found it interesting when she wrote about relearing how to use the laundrymat.  I wish she had addressed more her relearning of tasks.     Taylor  wrote how she is a better person now because she 's using her right brain. I found this to be mumbojumbo. Who knows- msybe she's a better person because she had time to examine herself and maybe because she was humbled by the fact that she became dependent on people.    Taylor repeated herself often and she wasn't a good writer. The information about the Havard Brain Bank was fascinating. I would not recommend this book .
0316017922|3.0|Finished Outliers last night and I found it to be consistent with Gladwell's two previous popular works, Blink & Tipping Point.  I think Gladwell is a great DESCRIBER. He has a knack for identifying interesting trends and relationships and describing them in unique ways that get the reader to consider non-standard explanations for why things happen. I often find that his conclusions, however, sometimes take a leap of faith or a sympathetic perspective. Gladwell is unabashedly liberal and the \\"there are no special people, only special circumstances\\" theme that underlies Outliers will probably not sit well with people who believe in the concept of self-reliance and the individual. Outliers is a pseudo-scientific \\"It Takes a Village\\" which does a great job of legitimately undoing typical rags to riches and tragic hero stories. But by assigning credit or blame for success and failure to large systems or mere chance, he undermines the importance of an individual's ability to Capitalized on Opportunities or Overcome bad Circumstances.  Outliers is a good read to learn about how the big picture must be understood to truly grasp the way successes and failures occur, but I'm afraid that his message may be a bit too egalitarian. While he gives brief nods to individual ability, the idea that Bill Gates and Wayne Gretzky are simply products of lucky timing or birth dates is a bit hard to swallow. People are not created equal, but suffering through or making the best of the cards your dealt may be more important factors of success than a few points of IQ or having rich parents at the end of the day, and Outliers does a good job of reminding us of that.
B001GF8WPI|3.0|\\"Stranger Than Fiction\\"  is the newly released Blu-ray Special Edition containing numerous impressive bonus extras.  Will Ferrell stars as Harold Crick, a lonely IRS agent whose mundane existence is transformed when he suddenly hears a mysterious voice narrating his life.  With the assistance of Prof. Jules Hilbert (Dustin Hoffman), Harold discovers he's the main character in a novel-in-progress and that the voice belongs to Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson), an eccentric author famous for disposing of her characters in unusual ways.  Harold must quickly track down Eiffel and stop her before she conjures up a way to kill him.     Director Mark Forster creates a fascinating world within a world in \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" and has elicited top performances from Ferrell and especially Hoffman, who looks as if he's having a ball with the role.  Unfortunately Queen Latifah, who can shine on screen in the right roles, is pretty much wasted here as Eiffel's assistant.  Bonus extras include commentary by Forster, Ferrell, and Hoffman; deleted and extended scenes; featurettes on filming in Chicago, writing the script, and the film's visual effects;  and a montage of funny on-set moments.

B001GKJ2F2|3.0|\\"Wanted\\" is a mile-a-second action picture that never lets up.  Wesley Gibson (James McAvoy) suddenly finds that his life as an ordinary office worker is over.  A beautiful woman, Fox (Angelina Jolie), crashes into his life and introduces him to the Fraternity, a secret society of assassins led by the mysterious Sloan (Morgan Freeman).  Wesley is informed that his long-lost father was murdered while working for the Fraternity and Wes has been chosen to target the rogue member who did it.  Before he can complete his assignment, he must first uncover the dark secrets behind the Fraternity to understand why he was selected and how he figures in its plans.<br /><br />The main attraction of \\"Wanted\\" is the amazing use of CGI special effects, from glass panes shattering as bodies fly through them to bullets redirecting their trajectory in mid-propulsion.  Jolie manages to look as comfortable in action flicks as in serious dramas like the recent \\"Changeling.\\"  She is quite the action babe and easy on the eye.  McAvoy, who showed his acting chops in \\"The Last King of Scotland\\" and \\"Atonement\\" seems an odd fit for \\"Wanted.\\"  He looks as if he's doing this one to pay for the new swimming pool.  He's fine in the early scenes as a drone-like worker lost in a huge company, but his transformation into this almost-indestructible super assassin is harder to accept.<br /><br />Bonus extras on this two-disc DVD include an extended scene; behind-the-scenes featurettes on the film's stunts, visual effects, and origins in the graphic novel; and a making-of documentary.
1400064287|5.0|This book is a must-read for marketing and/or advertising professionals. I'm new to my position as a marketing coordinator, and this book is actually on my required reading list for work. I'm so glad it is because I have some new insights into making an actual idea \\"stick.\\"     I won't go into the details of the books SUCCESs checklist, but it is a handy guide to keep in mind when you're promoting a new product or idea for your company. Some of my favorite parts of the book were the discussions on how the \\"my kidneys were stolen!\\" urban legend came to be, the tale of the nurse who helped save the baby because she recognized a fatal condition before the doctors did, and the legend of Jared the Subway guy who lost hundreds of pounds by eating Subway sandwiches every day. All of the stories were meant to illustrate how vividly these ideas \\"stick\\" with us while others--such as boring checklists and bullet points--simply fade into the background.     If I could say that I took one thing away from this book, it'd be that you should always be looking for ideas and recognize them when they're presented to you. And if you can create a story from that idea, you'll capture more attention than by using your Curse of Knowledge to explain yourself. Ordinary people don't understand jargon, but they do understand tales, examples, and stories.

0060723513|5.0|When a friend lent me this book, recommending it, he mentioned the controversy around it. I looked up the author on Wikipedia and read the scathing commentary, which almost put me off reading the book. I'm glad my curiosity prevailed, because it's worth reading. The book conveys some important messages about the way Western \\"civilisation\\" needs to recover our connection with the natural world, and it does so with great poetic simplicity.     The Wikipedia entry makes it sound as though this is a bit of corporate marketing literature, when it is quite the reverse - and the author is a natural writer: there are some really beautiful passages and perfect descriptions (for example, describing the rare sight of heavy rainclouds: \\"Occasionally we could even walk under the big overhead shadow, catching the same view an ant might see from the sole of a boot\\").    If books such as Robert Lawlor's \\"Voices of the First Day\\" are taken as a reference point, then it's not inconceivable that a tribe exists that lives in this way. In a way, though, does it matter? Although the outrage about cultural misappropriation is understandable, the heart of this book is clearly sincere, and if it's fictional then it is only employing a well-worn literary device that goes back at least as far as the Bible.     This book may well be a consolidation of the wisdom of various indigenous cultures, from Aboriginal to Native American, but distilling that wisdom into such a direct and beautifully written story is probably just what the doctor ordered when it comes to guiding a way out of the mess we've made - which we urgently need to do, for the sake of our planet and our species.
B000002LFU|4.0|Warner Brothers took home the trophy when R.E.M. reached the end of their IRS contract, and before \\"Green\\" was even released, the [[ASIN:B000001I0A murmurs]] of \\"sell-out\\" began. Oddly enough, the band had been consistently slouching towards the mainstream since \\"Radio Free Europe\\" first snuck onto college radio playlists and [[ASIN:B000002UW1 Document]] scored a top 40 single. When \\"Green\\" dropped with an even slicker production and (frankly) the band's sappiest single yet, \\"Stand,\\" a lot of earlier fans had their worst nightmares seemingly come to life.<br /><br />They could not have been more incorrect. Years down the line, it is apparent that [[ASIN:B000002UVZ Lifes Rich Pageant]] was the album where R.E.M. became a band that had a frontman as opposed to a quartet of guys who rocked. As Michael Stipe moved more to the front of the band, they became more conventional sounding, if only because the words, however incomprehensible the lyrics may have been, were now legible. The band's social views became more obvious (\\"Orange Crush\\" was a rant about untreated war vets), and the songs more straightforward. \\"Green\\" became the first R.E.M. album with a printed lyric, if only because they thought \\"World Leader Pretend\\" deserved recognition.<br /><br />This was also the album where the prominent alternate musical arrangements took a greater spotlight. Peter Buck strumming his mandolin on \\"You Are The Everything\\" showed where \\"Losing My Religion\\" would spring from once the band re-emerged with [[ASIN:B0006ICF9A Out of Time]] tow years from \\"Green.\\" \\"Hairshirt,\\" \\"World Leader Pretend\\" and \\"The Wrong Child\\" are terrific folk styled songs mixed among the pop tunes, and \\"Orange Crush\\" really does crush, with some solid guitars. As major label leaps are concerned, R.E.M. stayed true to their peculiar vision, without compromising it.
B001EOQWEO|4.0|This movie is very good and memorable. It brings tears but not whole lot of happiness. I like this movie because it is now reflecting to our true reality of saving the earth. However, compared to the other movies, I would say that this movie is not really funny. In fact, it was a bit boring. There are some improvements. First, make more dialogues and second is to make more funny scenes. If these two elements are existing, it is going to be a lot better. But overall, it is a great movie but there are rooms for improvements.
B000KX0IOA|5.0|Watching Richard Attenborough's masterpiece bio-epic is both an uplifting and draining experience. The performance of Ben Kingsley as Gandhi is one of those rare moments in film history where an actor seems to inhabit the character so completely allowing the viewer to get a deeper personal experience of an historical character.<br />Perfectly blending the political history with the personal story , this movie at 3 hours is an investment of time that pays dividends rarely found on a screen. I recently  watched this again after several years and was just as moved by it as when it was first released.<br />Many filmmakers  would go for the sentimental approach and try to create myths around their subject. In Gandhi there is a an element of that but the film will stand up to time because the portrayal is historically accurate and the subject at the heart of the film is a mythical character beyond the need of a boost from the movie.

Jeff Young absolutely shines on this one. His solos are melodic, catchy, and terrifyingly beautiful!!! I could do without Anarchy In The U.K., but they more than redeem themselves with Hook In Mouth, Liar, and In My Darkest Hour. Those 3 are the standouts.

B001F7MSFW|1.0|What a disappointment.  It is hard to imagine that the same director who put together Hellboy would allow this confused production into public view.  From the very beginning the script was contrived and confused.  The depiction of Hellboy as a \\"Young boy\\" was laughable and silly.  From there we go into contrived story about a underworld with no real basis in plot. Talk about the inappropriate use of gratuitous monsters...one is reminded of the MIB and the bar of star war fame on several occasions, but not in a good way.  The movie does no real character development except for a love development that is to say the least embarrassing. Not worth watching and a real disapointment for those of us who really enjoyed the real Hellboy.
B001GJOL22|5.0|Absolutely flawless!  This BD has absolutely stunning camera work, and incredible sound, especially watching it in DTS-HD Master Audio.  Amazing that they are only charging $20 for the BD version...This could easily be priced at $30.  Every fan needs this in their collection. Rush n Rio was great, R30 was Excellent,  this hands down tops both of those.
B001C46P2A|5.0|Baz Luhrmann spent five years down-under and now comes up for air with a thrilling, epic love story; it could have been a Warner Bros. Errol Flynn movie. But Flynn is gone. Doesn't matter. Here is Hugh Jackman(sexiest man in the world).  Nicole Kidman stars as a prissy Englishwoman who finds her husband engulfed in dire financial problems at his cattle ranch in Australia. Being self-willed, our young lady travels all the way to the ranch, to settle the problems, and sell the whole property. Arriving in Australia, our missy finds her husband murdered by a local native known as King George(or did he do it?), and her cattle ranch in an uproar. She fires the leering foreman, and considers hiring the dark, husky young Drover to help her get her cattle to market. But she doesn't like him. He's so pushy. He's so arrogant.... then again...Sound familiar? Well, there's no particularly new ground here, but there is a sprawling, colorful, sweeping saga filmed on location in Queensland, Wales, and Australia, surrounded by loving, masterful cinema strokes from one of our finest directors. CGI and rotoscope effects anchor beautiful, majestic shots of the baking desert and high country. It's hot, and things heat up as Kidman starts to melt, starting from the first night on the trail, when Jackman takes his shirt off to shower.  At almost three hours, \\"Australia\\" is too long, but boredom is not an option. Baz Luhrmann's 2001 musical classic \\"Moulin Rouge\\" was held captive in a Parisian dance-hall. Luhrmann's new \\"Australia\\"  explodes with the same quick-cut, self-confident magical movie-making style. Here is an honest, touching, magical journey. Here is a young boy and a native king, both born of the desert, and bound not to live without it. Here  is a story not bound to a wooden Parisian stage(\\"Moulin Rouge\\"). Here is a story not bound at all. Here is a story 'bout all of \\"Australia\\".
B001C46P2A|5.0|Australia is the movie that all movies wish they were. Nicole Kidman gives an Oscar worthy performance, easily one of the best of the year. Hugh Jackman and Brandon Walters are also great, and so are the supporting players. The film is STUNNING.

The melodies of Drown Out give me goose-bumps. The power of When Your Minds Made Up is ecstatic. The words of This Low are as moving as the best poetry. I haven't been able to stop playing this CD since it arrived today and I just can't believe how unknown it seems to be.

B00192KCQ0|4.0|This album is about as good as Metallica could have done RIGHT NOW.  The key is to go in not expecting a master of puppets II or And justice for all part II.  I really like this album and I put it on par with their 90's material, which is pretty good.  The main letdown for me is Kirk's solos.  They sound lazy and uninspried most of the time.  They're are a couple decent ones on tthe album, but most of the time he has something good going, then he'll come in with that obnoxious wah pedal and pretty much ruin the solo.  Wah just sounds so out of place on a metal album like this.  Also, the production is shoddy at best, but I don't think this is the band's fault really.    PROS:    -James vocals are great and it sounds like he put some thought into his lyrics.  -great guitar harmonies, something that has been missing since AJFA.  -drums are pretty good, Lars actually remembered he has toms to use.  -definatley no shortage of riffs, so the songs aren't repetitive like St. Anger.  - Album cover is cool and creative, best since Justice in my opinion.    CONS:    -The production is not very good, there is clipping abound.  -the bass ins't loud enough  -Kirk's solos are nothing to write home about, but at least there are solos this time I guess.  -I also hate how they cut a big hole in the booklet so you can't read the lyrics, very annoying.

B001FSDOZO|5.0|What a great album. This brings us back to the good 'ol days of the 80's. All about sex, drugs, and rock n' roll. produced by Mutt Lange, I have to give them a lot of credit to this great album. Ear sensitive people should listen to this rock n' roll, loosen up a 'lil will ya?
B001HDO4Z6|5.0|'Viva La Vida' was an album that took many different angles towards Coldplay's musical attitudes. They experimented with different instruments, beats, and all the while the lyrics stayed the same. The album as a whole was a genius move by the band as they knew they had to challenge themselves and channel a different thought. 'Prospekt's March' is the rest of the tracks that didn't make it onto 'Viva la Vida' for one reason or another. However, the tracks on this EP are done with the same careful planning and unique production as everything else this band does. Throughout this EP, the general vibe is that Coldplay took the same musical liberties it did on 'Viva la Vida', and it did nothing but engross me further into the music.    For example, putting words to 'Life in Technicolor', in my opinion, makes the song that much better; Although I'm not a fan of rap, bringing in Jay-Z to do a cameo on 'Lost+' is the creative push of a button that really works for the song. The all-acoustic 'Now My Feet Won't Touch the Ground' brings the tone of 'Til Kingdom Come' but is a stable avenue that they use with good success; Every song on this EP brings something different with touches of what has become Coldplay at its best.    My overall verdict is that this is a must-have as the band is still progressing while they remain at the top. The one thing that I have finally realized about this band is that there's nothing they won't try. And in my opinion, I don't think there's anybody that can pinpoint what they're going to do/try next. That's the surfacing mystique of this band, and it's simply awesome to see.
B001DHXT2A|4.0|I missed it at the Theatre so I was excited to see the DVD and it was awesome.  A great edition to my comicbook movies!
B00003JA7P|5.0|It's sort of amusing to write about an album that (1) has long been reviewed to death, (2) most everybody already has an opinion about (mostly positive, I'd gather), and (3) which, near as I can tell, you haven't been able to buy on vinyl in a little under a dog's age. Whatever...<br /><br />Right about the time EMI and the Boys sorted out their differences and greenlighted the CD release of the Beatles' catalog (anybody remember the feeding frenzy THAT created? Wait till you can get the stuff via iTunes and/or here at Amazon...oh yes, it's no longer *if* it'll happen, just exactly *when*), there was also a limited-edition, Direct Metal Mastered reissue of The White Album, serial-numbered on the cover, like the original, and, for good measure, pressed in white vinyl, and included a poster and additional Beatle-tchotchkes. I skipped buying the CD release in favor of this LP set, wondering if I was making a dumb move.<br /><br />Now I'm wondering how much this thing is worth right now, although I'm not keen on getting rid of it. (Yep, I still love vinyl, even though I've been down with the CD and iPod thing for a while, too).<br /><br />The music? After all this time, what can *I* add? :-)<br /><br />The quality of the pressing, as to be expected, is whisper-quiet. The remastering job was well-done as well.<br /><br />Something for collectors (and would-be collectors) to keep an eye out for.
0812974786|5.0|Hilda Rosner's translation for Bantam is the standard as far as \\"Siddhartha\\" is concerned, but this new translation by Susan Bernofsky captures the spirit of Hesse's work equally as well, if not better. Her wording is less detached, less archaic, and ultimately more involving than Rosner's, while not as close to the original tone of the novel. Translating is rewriting, as we all know, and Bernofsky does a very good job of rewriting \\"Siddhartha.\\"
B000Y2WAKM|5.0|I love this CD.  I'd heard the Eels before but didn't realize it.  I heard them on the PBS show \\"Parallel Worlds, Parallel Lives\\" and like the music so I decided to try this best of CD.  I love nearly every song.  Mr. E's Beautiful Blues, Flyswatter and Trouble With Dreams are my favorites.  Good stuff!
B001GQACGO|1.0|This cd was horrible!  I tried to listen to it twice and just couldn't. I noticed that after her major success w/Dangerously in Love (which was an excellent album), Beyonce just went downhill. BDay was a mess and this is total garbage!   Disc 1 has only 2 good songs (Halo and Ave Maria).  Disc 2 has only 1 ok song (Sweet Dream) And you see how she made 2 cd's out of one?  Both cd's combined equal 63min!  Beyonce's just becoming 1)less creative, 2) greedy, 3)shallow, 4) a fake...I can go on and on.  To sum it all up- just negative  thanks partly to her new husband.  She loves him so much, she's trying to become him!  Solange's album was so much better!  Spend your money on that cd instead!  Or if not, just download the few songs from Sasha Fierce!  (what a corny title)
B00169N0BK|1.0|Several issues with this product, all software related.  I haven't gotten far enough to qualify the icc results.  First of all, the CD you receive has nothing on it except a small application that downloads the actual software. So, no internet connection, no calibration. I was installing on a laptop, and luckily was at home.  Second, you only get three machine activations of the software.. after that I guess your Colormunki becomes an expensive paperweight. Good thing my camera isn't restricted to 3 machines, or I'd really be in trouble. You also need that internet connection to \\"activate\\" your software. Under OSX it seems to only activate it for a single account. Thirdly, I was only able to calibrate one of my two monitors, the software produces an errors for the second. I'll finish testing, but the 3 machine software installation limit for an expensive piece of hardware is asinine, and will most likely result in a return... especially since I have 4 machines at home.
B000J0UD94|5.0|Although I never saw the movie, I fell in love with the sound track the first time I heard it.  For about two years I checked every video shop I could find with no luck.  It never dawned on me to check Amazon.Com for a video but there it was.  Everything went as promised and the video arrived two days early.    Many thanks, I look forward to more purchases, you make it so easy.
B001HUSHL6|5.0|First, no television show could possibly recreate for viewers exactly how things are inside an OMC (outlaw motorcycle club). I think that SoA goes as far as it can in the re-creation but then, by necessity, stops. An example of that would be how the family atmosphere inside Samcro is overly sugar coated in some scenes. On the other hand, showing the sweeter side of the club members is essential to developing their characters. How well that is done may be reflected in the eventual success or failure of this show.       Sons of Anarchy is good entertainment if you aren't too picky about occasional scenes that are just plain vulgar. You'll also have to be able to tolerate characters such as Tig, who is being revealed bit-by-bit as a more complicated character than many viewers would have suspected earlier in the season. I cannot forget or forgive that was Tig who said, \\"No wonder I beat up hookers,\\" when he was feeling exasperated by Gemma. But it seems the real threat from him isn't to hookers, it is the level of resistance he has against Jaz's attempts to legitimize the club. That may show an even darker side of Tig than we have already seen.     I can't wait until next season!! By the way, in case you don't know, each episode of SoA is available for purchase for less than $2 here on amazon.
1427200882|5.0|Not being an economist, I found this audiobook understandable and interesting. The author made the concepts clear, a point of view everyone should consider within the mix.
B00005RHGL|5.0|[[ASIN:B00005RHGL Tombstone - The Director's Cut (Vista Series)]]  As opposed to the DVD Tombstone which is a single DVD cased in a black box contianer, the \\"Director's Cut\\" provides us with a wonderful \\"Silhouette-Beige\\" Earthtone - Double-folding Jacket which contains two (2) DVD's. Wow! Next, this double-folding jacket slides into a TOMBSTONE color-portfolio box! The earthtone colors are simply amazing to view; I was so moved by the professional artistry that it took me almost an entire hour to cease reviewing its breath taking beauty.<br />  Once inside the jacket, one discovers a continuing theme of this same earthtone artistry. Director George A. Cosmatos provides us with surprize after surprize and his cut answers one of the most lingering unanswered questions that the regular single DVD encased in black doesn't address -- \\"What ever happened to Kate, Doc Holiday's woman?? If one recalls that once Doc Holiday has entered the sanitarium, Kate is nowhere to be found! Well the Director's Cut provides a answer but beware the answer will \\"shock\\" you! I didn't mention the hand drawn map of the shoot-out at the \\"OK\\" Corral that is drawn in Wyatt Earp's own hand. (opps!) The Director's Cut is well worth the price but I could not bring myself to purchase a \\"used\\" copy - no way!

B00005JPS8|5.0|Fantastic movie.  I have been a Marvel fan since I could read comics in my home town's Rexall store.  Now that dates me, I am sure.  Anyway Robert Downy Jr. is terrific as \\"The Iron Man\\".  Hope to see more sequels with  equally great performances. Sorry to hear that his buddy won't be played by the same actor, but oh well that's Hollywood for you.
0765342294|5.0|It is difficult to write a review on a book considered by many to be a modern-day classic of science fiction. I risk either falling flat in an attempt to give an honest, insightful review, or raving in a manner which invariably leads to disappointed hopes. I will err on the cautious side, therefore.<br /><br />I think what draws people to Ender's Game is that it is as much psychological suspense as it is science fiction. Thus, readers who rarely enjoy SF are enthralled by Orson Scott Card's imaginative prose and engaging characters. Ender's Game is a fantastic introduction into a genre that is often classified as \\"nerdy.\\" It can be enjoyed equally by hard core sci-fi fans and pedantic literary critics.
1400031524|5.0|This was my 1st Henning Mankell book and I thought it was great!! I couldn't put it down.  I like Inspector Wallander's down to earth, everyman kind of approach to life.  And this is coupled with a strong policeman's street sense and the natural innate ability to come up with the right conclusions every time.  I like how the author often refers to his dead and departed police friend and asks himself how he would see a particular situation.  I'm definitely going to buy more of these books.
0380977273|4.0|\\"Something Wicked This Way Comes\\" is a dark tale about weakness in the face of temptation. A tale that is a moving commentary on youth and relationships, as well as being unsettling when it depicts how regrets affect our attitudes and actions in maturity.      The book centers on two boys moving into adolescence, Jim Nightshade and Will Halloway, best friends born two minutes apart.  When Cooger & Dark's Pandemonium Shadow Show rolls into town with its carnival attractions, the boys natural curiosity for adventure lead them to discover the sinister intentions of the show.  The boys, as different as light and dark but complimentary to each other, must work to save the community (and themselves). To stop Mr. Dark they must fight their own desires and growing impulses.    Ray Bradbury's writing style is lyrical and poetic which takes a few pages to get accustomed to, but ultimately enhances a book that if written in a more direct style would feel slightly empty. The tone is dark and brooding in a beautiful way that carries the novel to heights above where it should be for the story alone.  Although the story has wonderful coming of age yearnings, mystical and dark action and a lovely father and son awakening, the theme of loving yourself and accepting your fears is slightly bland. It is Bradbury's lyrical writing that creates an emotion on the page that leaves the reader mesmerized.      There is much to enjoy with this book.  Although the book is developed around the two boys and their relationship, I found myself routing for Will's father to shed his fears of being irrelevant and not miss the opportunity to show his son that it is his maturity that will be needed to beat back Cooger and Dark.  I also loved some of the really spooky possibilities of how Cooger and Dark's carrousel could create situations where innocence of youth may not be so innocent.      A good book with some very beautiful writing and scenes, but overall it seems slightly incomplete with many themes just touched upon leaving the reader wanting more.
B000YABYLA|4.0|My husband and I rented this on a rainey Saturday night, not expection that great of a film, but my daughter gave it such great reviews.  I have to say that Ellen Page is the actress that made this film better than a TV movie. She played the part of JUNO like she actually lived it in reality. The ending is unexpectably sad. Good performance from Jason Bateman.  Jennifer Garner played the part of the lame and pathetic wife of Bateman who in the end loses her husband to get the one thing she has always wanted in her  marriage a child.  Rent it it is not bad for not quite a two hour time.  The writing is the real winner in this movie.
B000BHHVPO|5.0|If for no other reason, buy this DVD set while you can. It contains the last time the original members of Pink Floyd played together since the early 80's.  Now with the passing of Richard Wright they will never be a concert with the Original Line up (I'm not counting Syd)  Floyd songs are:  Speak to Me / Breath  Money  Wish You Were Here  Comfortably Numb  Disc 4 has a mini documentary of Pink Floyd reheresing for the concert.  This is a must for all Pink Floyd fans

B000AU9UYC|1.0|I suppose Hollywood producers could not leave Batman alone in the current revival of every existing comic figure, even if the last filmed series had already exploited most of the possibilities with one peak achievement, the beautiful \\"Batman returns\\" with the superb Michelle Pfeiffer as the deadliest and most convincing Catwoman ever.<br /><br />So, to find something new, we have here a \\"let's go back to the beginnings\\", hark! hark! such a novelty this is, trying to explore what was purposefully left unsaid by the creators of the character.<br /><br />There is the usual sticky-sweet story of the poor soul wronged by men and fate who after a long wandering in the dark discovers his real self, hark hark in the far east, among kung fu teachers.<br />There is the usual town corrupted to the core, where all people are desperate or desperately evil but where a group of righteous souls still works for the greater good (taking an airplane to some more reasonable resort?)<br /><br />Ethics are trite and commonplace, completely uninteresting, so is character development and interaction.<br />Christian Bale is as intense as grated parmesan and so is Katie Holmes. The others are fairly good, each up to the not much required trying to give sense to the senseless lines they are given.<br /><br />Situations and atmosphere are convincingly gloomy and desolate; this film appears to have many very vocal fans but can only be seen switching one's synapsis off.
B000RPTQ1C|4.0|When I first heard Coldplay's Viva Vidla (sorry bad spelling) I couldn't but to think of one band U2!! And I like U2!! I mean, I am familar with Coldplay's music like \\"Clocks\\" and \\"Yellow\\" but Coldplay's latest CD sound so much like U2, I just had to get it!!! I mean, I even saw Chris Martin perform on SNL, and I kept thinking \\"He's the next Bono!\\" lol Not dissing this band, they are great in their own right, great CD, but they need to shed this U2wanna-be image!
B000MNP2K8|1.0|This film features Judi Dench and I love her. She is one of those British actors who conceal their enormous skill (clarity of speech, mimic, postures) under a deceptive ease. When acting Shakespeare they can be operatic but when they play \\"normal\\" characters they appear real, everyday. But try and ask a lesser professional to play an everyday part and you shall see the difference.<br /><br />Daniel Craig is not such a novelty. I loved Timothy Dalton and he was a very physical Bond as well. I am not saying that Mr Craig is a miscast: he seems an excellent actor (I know no other movie of his), he has a beautiful muscular body that the authors display throughout the film, an eastern European (Polish or Russian I should say) look that is peculiar and easy to remember.<br /><br />The authors tried to offer the public an updated 007, very physical, gory, even crude but casting Mr Craig has been useless because they left the rest unchanged. The famous opening scene, Bond and the bomber jumping from a crane to the other is just as improbable as similar scenes in the past Roger Moore movies were.<br />The situations are trite, the villains are mono dimensional, the women are just beautiful and meaningless.<br /><br />And please, the dialogues?<br /><br />These movies are intended for the general public, allright, but do the lines have to be idiotic? Do they have to convey the usual \\"Me Tarzan, you Jane\\" content and ethics? The only really good exchange? That of Bond tortured by Le Chiffre, but perhaps I was distracted by the sight of Mr Craig's naked body.<br /><br />There are a lot of beautiful actors in this film but the rest is unchanged.
630512762X|5.0|I am so happy with my dvd. Not only is it a great movie, the seller got it to me super fast!
B000UBMWG4|5.0|Sometimes you just need to give a film a second chance, even if it is 20 years later!  Only some rave reviews about the picture quality of this new 5-disc \\"Complete Collector's Edition\\" enticed me to watch this again. Wow, I am glad; this was a very entertaining and a tremendous visual and audio treat.    I actually appreciated the audio best because, even in this new Blu-Ray era, one doesn't often find a film with very active surround speakers. However, this \\"restored\\" version did and the sound is, at the point, the best I've heard on a Blu-Ray disc....or any DVD, for that matter.  The visuals? Well, fans of Blade Runner know all about them. They are fantastic.  Scene-after-scene reminded me of a Stanley Kubrick film or another bizarre 1980s movie called \\"Jacob's Ladder.\\"    I can see where people would watch this film mulitple times and enjoy it very much each time.  The \\"Collector's Edition\\" has the best picture ever, according to director Ridley Scott, and \\"is the version I'm most pleased with.\\" That's good enough for me.  The rest of the DVD has those earlier versions,  including the original theatrical release with Harrison Ford doing  narration, like out of a late `40s film noir....so I am anxious to hear that - and this time, appreciate this movie.    Is this five-disc version worth a few extra bucks? Yeah!
B001GKYBXA|5.0|I bought this cd expecting the worse, but was pleasently surprised at what Paul McCartney here has to offer.  I never knew about his other two Fireman cds, less alone never heard any music from them and now I read that they are hard to find and are collectors items!  That is the real reason I bought this in the first place and I'm a big fan as well!  But the music stands up, I enjoyed it immensely!  I thought it would just be a shelf burner but in all reality, I'll be giving this one a listen all too often!  Now I need the story why he is using the name of Fireman???
1400063515|3.0|1. The prose was EXTREMELY BLOATED. He took 5 sentences where two would have done just fine. One gets a sense of deja vu here. Ayn Rand is also someone who took at least 3x as much space as she needed to say anything. It is amazing that after all that space, she still didn't have that much to say. Even after all this, it appears that Taleb didn't have that much to say. I guess that you can't use book sales to predict how good/ useful a book will be. (But I guess we already knew that. Look at Danielle Steele.)<br /><br />2. In continuing with the point about how long winded this book is: Was it really necessary to go on for *34* (!) pages before introducing the thesis of the book?<br /><br />3. He could have taken some lessons from Malcolm Gladwell in how to pull the book together. (As in, how to take some observations that may not have been too interesting by themselves and connect them in some interesting way that makes a good book.)<br /><br />4. The book, by rights, was about a 175-200 page book. (Did I mention how annoying it is to have to search through a book for the points?)<br /><br />5. The best way would have been for this book to start off with a couple of examples that needed explaining and then develop the ideas from that. So, in a nutshell, the author wanted us to know about how some randomness is non Gaussian and therefore describing something as having a \\"fat right tail\\" (a common term to describe Gaussian distributions) is really a misnomer-- and that the randomness is actually Mandelbrotian. OK. All well and good. Did he really have to go through something like 250 pages before getting to the centerpiece?<br /><br />Good points:<br /><br />1. The author really does have some interesting material. The only problem is that the reader has to search through SO MUCH rubbish to be able to find it.<br /><br />2. There are a few witty quips here. Not many, but a few that had me laughing out loud.<br /><br />Overall, this is definitely not worth more than a secondhand purchase. And if you are someone that is very judicious in using your time (=not searching through a book for the point), then this is not the book for you.cious in using your time (=not searching through a book for the point), then this is not the book for you.
B001GQACGE|5.0|I'm shocked that so many people gave negative reviews for this CD.  She's changing her style a bit and I love it.  It's a great CD - give it a chance.
B000P0I4O4|5.0|Can enough good things be said about this man? He is a very versatile actor, and brings good things to whatever he plays in. It is no understatement to say that his face on the cover of a movie is evidence enough to know that it is good.<br /><br />As for this movie: The plot was interesting, and the action was intense. After watching it, one did ask the question of how a gym teacher took such a profound interest in returning a captive professional killer-- at the risk of his life. And one does wonder how someone got in touch with just the right governmenet official that wanted to see this hitman snuffed out.<br /><br />But, other than that, it was quite good.
B001GQACGE|1.0|This CD is the worst CD I heard all yr.  Beyonce you should be ashamed of yourself putting out GARBAGE like this.  WTF were you thinking.  I would like a refund ASAP
B000002I8H|3.0|It wasn't all that great. The best point of the whole thing was listening to the jazz like arrangements and interpreting what was possibly meant by this or that different voicing/ chord substition. A lot of songs take on a whole different meaning when they are reinterpreted (which explains why some people have bigger hits when playing other people's music), but these songs didn't take on all that different of a meaning from the original pieces.<br /><br />The strongest track was \\"The Fool on The Hill.\\"<br /><br />This is worth a secondhand purchase price and not much more.
0446581348|1.0|I found this book to be a very basic makeup book for maybe a pre teen, since it covered brush types (which most makeup users already know about). This would normally be okay, but there are lots of detailed pages on brushes which I found to be unnecessary.  The book also covers the basics, such as, mositurizers, toners, and cleansers.  What to use for your specific skin type (which we all know by now, so why have several pages in the book for this purpose). It also talks about some no's in makeup, which is not really a no for makeup artist anymore. It covers which colors are best for which eye color or skin color, but I found this to be untrue. It's all aboout how you blend your makeup and the quality of your makeup (I'm speaking of eye shadow). I don't recommend this book for purchase. Go by your local library and look at it first before you buy, because I think this book is for pre teens only.
B00005JNQA|4.0|It's a story that happens all the time in Sub-Saharan Africa. Some corrupt government comes to power and executes its opponents.<br /><br />This is worth a rental, but not a purchase.<br /><br />The acting was decent. One big goof was that it looked like Africans from several different parts of the continent were used and it showed. (People from one region tend to favor one another in spite of the fact that they are from different tribes.)
B000002UZ1|3.0|I have had this one for thirteen years, enjoying a love/hate relationship with it. Half the cuts I can live without, and the other half is essential to every collection. To give you an idea of where my tastes lie, I have always hated the bubble gum pop prior to their drug-inspired hippie days. I have also considered them to be highly over-rated, since my tastes in progressive music leaned towards early Yes and Genesis. Many would say that the Beatles introduced art and creativity into rock, albeit with drugs as their vehicle. Yes, this is true, but so many other groups took this much further. With that in mind, this set and the stellar Abbey Road was all that I needed for many years. Then the Yellow Submarine Songtrack was released, which brought back memories of many trippy midnight movies. I consider that one to be a much better and cheaper introduction to the best of The Beatles, since it represents some of their best from late 1965 to early 1969, with only a few new songs (when it was released). So I have sufficed with just three Beatles releases up until now.<br /><br />Well, I got to wondering today on how much it would cost to add some more good Beatles songs to my collection. For my tastes, this was surprisingly affordable. This also led me to identify why I have the love/hate relationship with this collection, which also had put me off with the Beatles in general for all these years. All of my own favorite cuts are not represented enough here, and too many of the overplayed and annoying cuts are on this one. I have finally decided to complete my Beatles collection of favorites and donate this puppy to my girlfriend.<br /><br />So if your tastes run similar to mine, here is what I recommend in chronological order. Start off with Past Masters Volume 2 (which contains all of the 1965-1970 non-album singles), then Revolver, Sgt. Pepper, Magical Mystery Tour, Yellow Submarine Songtrack, The White Album, and Abbey Road. I will throw in Let It Be just for the sake of completion.  I plan to make my own compilation for my car and leave all of my hated cuts off. Judging from most of the reviews, all Beatles fans need to do the same, since no one compilation can satisfy anyone. They put out a lot of good stuff, but due to their willingness to experiment, they could never satisfy everyone. A lot of their later stuff even makes me cringe, but a lot of it still stands the test of time forty years later.<br /><br />If you want a good compilation to start with, try the Yellow Submarine Songtrack, but not this one.I plan to make my own compilation for my car and leave all of my hated cuts off.

B000069I1H|5.0|A few things:<br /><br />1. Robert DeNiro shines as the gruff officer in this movie.<br /><br />2. The movie is good when you are in the mood for something light and not too involved (in terms of plot).<br /><br />3. Eddie Murphy is funny, as ever. It is a testament to this man's versatility that he is a good actor, a comedian, and even does a good job acting like an actor who can't act.<br /><br />4. Mos Def was even able to redeem himself after his horrible performance in \\"16 blocks.\\"<br /><br />Very funny, and it kept me laughing for the whole time.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|Ratatouille was a great movie in my opinion. It follows the story of a Rat living on the outskirts of Paris, France and his desire to become a Chef. Disney and Pixar have a fairly decent tag team going on here, but not every movie they make is good. Back in 2006, they released \\"Cars\\", and to me that was a bad movie. Someone told me that with \\"Cars\\" Disney and Pixar attempted an overindulgence of humor, which cost it winning the Academy Award that year because no one took it serious. \\"Happy Feet\\" won the award that year and it deserves it because of it's deep and emotional story that the message was mainly trying to say that our world is changing and we need to save it for the lives of others. Now to get back on topic, Ratatouille wanted to remove to excessive amount of humor and add more of a story to the mix. It was able to successfully pull this off and still was able to throw in the right amount of humor. It's a fairly long movie to, so you get your moneys worth by watching this. There was a time where I had no desire to see this movie what so ever, but I saw it after many people told me it was pretty good, and I was surprised that I actually enjoyed watching this movie.
B00005JLZN|4.0|Kevin Spacey does a great job with his character acting.<br /><br />There was enough suspense in the movie to keep me interested for the whole thing-- and enough to make the movie worth watching twice to see what was missed the first time around.<br /><br />It is a bit hard to believe that someone would allow himself to be executed just to make a point about the death penalty. It is even harder that to imagine that he would fake a rape just to put himself in jail as a way to make him easier to execute.<br /><br />The parts of the plot were MOSTLY resolved at the end, but it is still not clear in what way was the \\"student who would do anything\\" tied to the whole plot. A bit of clarification would not have taken that much extra time. And it is on this account that the movie loses one star.
0812932293|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this autobiography, a great look behind the scene. I realize this is just a one sided account of events but I found it to be very candid, inspiring and often humorous.    Richard shows us that fun and joy should be the foundation of creating your life, because life is going to happen anyway. There is no such thing as can't, unless you believe in it. It really is good to feel good.
B001GKJ2FC|4.0|Wanted is pure entertainment! What makes this film unique is its ability to execute over the top scenarios while still remaining polished and coherent. Wanted is a story that sucks you in and gives you something to chew on for two hours, afterwards spitting you out and wanting (no pun intended) more. The movie has a minor plot twist but mainly focuses on the action and sticks to it. Its unbelievable action scenes are over the top but remain tasteful. It can honestly be said there is nothing like it. The textile mill scene at the end keeps you on edge as you root for the protagonist and cheer!    The great thing about this movie is its sense of humor and the ability of the director to suspend the audience and make the action believable. Too often action movies have special effects that aren't convincing or take away from the experience. I'm not saying flipping a car to evade a car chase is convincing but from an entertainment stand point you find your self thing \\"cool\\" rather than \\"cheesy.\\" When people are flying around screen with wire harnesses connected to them and moving in abnormal ways then the suspension of disbelief starts to fade. Wanted uses special FX you want to hate but you find yourself smiling instead?! That are truly top notch and the editing is as well.    With that said, buy this movie! It will leave you with a smirk on your face. Wanted is a mixture of Fight Club, Spider Man, and the Matrix. If you like any of those films this movie is for you. I would have rated this film as a 5 star must have but I am disappointed the ending wasn't left open for a sequel :0). I also here that in the actual book the protagonist had a cool leather outfit that failed to make an appearance in the film. Oh well, the soon to be released video game will make up for all of that as you can play with the suit or without!!!

B000K7VHQ4|4.0|It's odd, but in the year 2006 there were two major motion pictures to feature stories about magicians and/or illusionists. The first film was The Illusionist, while the second film was [[ASIN:B000LC55F2 The Prestige]]. In my humble opinion The Prestige is a superior film mainly because of the film's technical execution under the watchful eye of director Christopher Nolan.<br />But I digress.<br />The Illusionist is a surprisingly engaging suspense film with strong supernatural or \\"fantasy\\" elements. Writer/director Neil Burger made the film on a relatively small budget, but this doesn't have a negative impact on the end result. On the contrary, The Illusionist is a better film than most supernatural thrillers because it relies on characterization to carry the story, rather than over-the-top action and unnecessary special effects. The few special effects in the film are subtle and understated, which in some strange way only makes them more impressive.<br /><br />The story is set in Vienna, during the dawn of the 20th century, where an illusionist named Eisenheim causes a commotion with his startling magic tricks. He soon attracts the intention of the social elite, including Vienna's own Crown Prince Leopold. Leopold, an arrogant, ambitious, and cynical man, feels threatened by Eisenheim's extraordinary abilities. He is outraged that Eisenheim knows more than he, and so as a ploy to reveal Eisenheim's methods, Leopold offers his fianc&eacute;e, the beautiful Duchess Sophie von Teschen to participate in one of Eisenheim's illusions. However, Crown Prince Leopold is ignorant to the fact that Eisenheim and the duchess were once childhood sweethearts and that Eisenheim made her a promise that they would one day be reunited. After Eisenheim's uncanny performance, he and the duchess rekindle their romance. When the jealous Crown Prince Leopold learns that the duchess has been unfaithful to him, he is consumed by jealousy and rage. When the duchess' body is found to have been murdered, the public suspects the crown prince has killed her, though they dare not voice their suspicions. But Leopold suspects Eisenheim's trickery played some part in his fianc&eacute;e's death, so he assigns Chief Inspector Uhl to uncover Eisenheim's secrets. Yet, Uhl is confounded when Eisenheim begins summoning disembodied spirits during his performances, and when Eisenheim conjures Duchess von Teschen's spirit on stage, the audience cries out that Crown Prince Leopold has murdered her. Fearing that a revolution against the monarchy may be at hand, Uhl doubles his efforts to unravel the growing mystery surrounding Eisenheim's abilities, the duchess' death, and what part if any that the crown prince had to play in her murder. But Uhl's investigation takes him deep into a world of illusion and conspiracy, where nothing is what it seems.<br /><br />One of the film's greatest strengths is the extraordinary ensemble cast, which features [[ASIN:B00003W8NM Edward Norton]] as Eisenheim the Illusionist, [[ASIN:B0007TKOAA Paul Giamatti]] as Chief Inspector Uhl, [[ASIN:B0018O4YT0 Rufus Sewell]] as Crown Prince Leopold, and Jessica Biel as Duchess Sophie von Teschen. While Norton, Giamatti, and Sewell give typically strong performances, the real surprise is Jessica Biel, who gives what may be her most complex and convincing performance yet.<br />Where the film fails ever so slightly is that director Neil Burger seems to be attempting to make some sort of a statement about the role that spirituality plays in politics. But this shortcoming is outweighed by the film's many superlatives. Employing numerous sleight of hand tricks to manipulate the audience's perception of the storyline, Neil Burger creates an ambiguity, which will leave viewers questioning whether anything truly supernatural occurred or whether the seeming magic that took place was just an elaborate deception. I'll let you decide, but remember: Don't believe what you see.<br /><br />Also recommended:<br />[[ASIN:B0012OSGJK Houdini: The Movie Star]]<br />[[ASIN:B001BGS17Q Time After Time]]<br />[[ASIN:B0011E5M66 The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]<br />[[ASIN:B0000AUHQR Fairy Tale: A True Story]]<br />[[ASIN:B000BB152A Criss Angel: Mindfreak: The Complete Season One]]<br />[[ASIN:B000HDR8BO Criss Angel: Mindfreak: The Complete Season Two]]001BGS17Q Time After Time]]  [[ASIN:B0011E5M66 The Adventures of Baron Munchausen]]  [[ASIN:B0000AUHQR Fairy Tale: A True Story]]  [[ASIN:B000BB152A Criss Angel: Mindfreak: The Complete Season One]]  [[ASIN:B000HDR8BO Criss Angel: Mindfreak: The Complete Season Two]]
0307346617|5.0|It's rare that I come across a book that I just can't put down, but this was one of them.  It is organized like a series of short stories, and each one was so vividly realized that I wanted to know more about that vignette's character.  Together, the stories paint an incredibly detailed and believeable picture of what such a conflict might be like.  So much so that I found myself occasionally caught in the reality of the book's world when I wasn't reading it.  Handled properly, this could be adapted into an incredible film.
B00004YA66|4.0|In the thriller Frequency, directed by Gregory Hoblit ([[ASIN:6305127697 Primal Fear]] and [[ASIN:0780622537 Fallen]]), audiences were given an unexpectedly well-made science fiction/suspense film. The film is an expertly directed piece of entertainment that will have viewers so absorbed in its thrilling story that they may have trouble coming back to reality after the end credits have rolled.  The film, which was written by Toby Emmerich, explores what happens if a person could alter the past by communicating through time. And while dealing with such heady quantum conundrums, the story also allows for moments of genuine emotion.    Troubled New York detective John Sullivan's life is changed forever when he contacts his father, Frank Sullivan, with an old ham radio. What makes their reunion so extraordinary is the fact that Frank died in a fire thirty years earlier. When John realizes that the Aurora Borealis (or Northern Lights) is enabling him to communicate with his father in 1969, he warns him of his death, thus giving Frank the opportunity to save himself and change the future. But altering the timeline proves to be complicated and dangerous as the Sullivan family soon finds out. When John discovers that his effect on the past has changed the future sequence of events, resulting in his mother's death at the hands of a serial killer in 1969, he must uncover the truth about who killed her so that his father can stop her murder before it happens. Utilizing his detective skills, John guides his father on a search for the killer, but the more they disrupt the course of events in the past, the more they find themselves endangered in the future. It's not long before the entire Sullivan family is under threat and their only hope for a life together is dependent upon Frank's resourcefulness and John's guidance. Can they solve the murder of John's mother before she's killed or will they be forced to watch as their temporal interference costs them that which they hold dearest; their family?    The film stars Dennis Quaid as Frank Sullivan and Jim Caviezel as John Sullivan. The supporting cast includes Andre Braugher, Elizabeth Mitchell, Shawn Doyle, and Noah Emmerich (the screenwriter's brother). Both Quaid and Caviezel give strong performances, as does the entire cast. Adding to the power of the performances is the subtle aging makeup that it is skillfully applied to the actors to help viewers differentiate between the characters in 1969 and 1999.  One of the things that makes Frequency truly unique is that it manages to root itself in the foundations of multiple genres. Being part science fiction, part murder mystery, and part family drama, the film could have easily fallen apart if it weren't for the concentrated efforts of its director.  Another interesting aspect of the film is that it's essentially a time travel film in which no one actually travels through time. Only information is relayed back and forth through the ham radio, which limits the opportunities for action and the visual effects set pieces while heightening the suspense.  Now the film isn't perfect. There are some serious flaws in the story's logic when it comes to quantum physics and the disruption of the space-time continuum, but the story is absorbing enough that this shouldn't bother many viewers.  Also adding to the film's overall impact is the exciting score by master film composer Michael Kamen, who combines taut, suspenseful musical cues with haunting themes that echo the emotions of the characters.  All in all, Frequency is an exhilarating thriller that should not be forgotten.    The excellent DVD includes an audio commentary by director Gregory Hoblit, an audio commentary by writer Toby Emmerich and actor Noah Emmerich, a trivia track, The Science Behind Frequency documentary, deleted scenes, image galleries, and more.

0596522347|4.0|[[ASIN:0596522347 slide:ology: The Art and Science of Creating Great Presentations]]    I enjoyed the book. It is well laid out with some really nice graphics and images to illustrate the points. The book covers basic design concepts with good examples on the do's and don'ts. I found the different iconic representations of abstract concepts in Chapter 3 particularly useful. The book is inspiring and by the time I reached the last page, I was looking forward to applying the new knowledge on my next presentation. The challenge though, would be to create amazing graphics like those in the book to inject the \\"wow\\" factor. I would have appreciated some mention on the tools used to produce the graphics in the book and how readers with no professional graphic design skills could bridge this gap.
B001GKJ2DO|4.0|Yes, the critics are right. It's cheesy. The plot's an embarrassment. And Brosnan can't sing. But it was GREAT!<br /><br />This movie is meant for audience participation. That's why there are sub-titles/lyrics when the singing starts - Sing along! After the movie was released, ABBA's music had a revival.<br /><br />And this is not really a movie - just an excuse to sing along to ABBA songs. And a reminder of when you used to know these songs so well.<br /><br />And Pierce Brosnan's role in the movie is simply so you'd know that at least you're not the worst singer of the day!
B001GQACGE|1.0|Wow, I purchased this cd the same day it came out thinking that It was going to be her best so far. Boy was I surprised...I keep hearing the Deluxe album is much better. I guess I should of got that instead. But Bey, what happened with this album? The Slow tempo songs are way better then the fast, so-called \\"club\\" songs. I'm very disappointed in this album...
0060558121|4.0|I am new to Neil Gaiman.  I never read Sandman, and first read his novel Neverwhere (excellent).  I really enjoyed American Gods, but less than Neverwhere.  It is definitely more of an urban fantasy, taking place in our real world with fantastical characters mostly taken from obscure foreign mythology.  While Neverwhere toggled between our real world and the fantasy underworld, American Gods takes place all within our real world, implying that the fantastical is happening all around us.  I missed the creation of the fantastical world done so well in Neverwhere.<br /><br />In American Gods I did particularly like the interludes in the early part of the book that told the stories of foreign gods as they arrived in America.  I found the lead up to battle between the gods to be too drawn out and in the end anti-climactic. But Gaiman's style makes the book very readable.
B0014I4KIK|4.0|In the newly-popular 60s genre minted to perfection by bad Winehouse grrls, Duffy stands out from the rest of the pack with her brassy tones in the megahit 'Mercy'.     Her smoke-tinged vocals in 'Warwick Avenue' and'Serious' also recall the finer moments of Lulu and Dusty Springfield... all good fun and nostalgia...
B001EOQWEO|4.0|The movie itself is awesome.      The disney \\"digital file\\" on the other hand is lacking.  This review would be 5 stars if the digital file wasn't so crippled.  You can only transfer it once from the CD to your laptop/computer.  And then you can only transfer it once from there to your digital device.  If you lose your code, out of luck, call Disney.  If your computer crashes and you lose your digital file, out of luck, you can't even call Disney.  If your download didn't work from the CD to computer, out of luck again.
B0000047CX|5.0|I discovered Astrud Gilberto quite by accident when rummaging thru my sister's extensive jazz album collection...     Really wanted to hear her defintive interpretations of 'Corcovado' (after being captivated by EBTG's brilliant drum 'n bass remake) and the seminal standard 'The Girl From Ipanema', and am really enjoying this album.
B000KKPN5C|4.0|This is a great little flash for the 40, 40x, and 60. It gives you the ability to bounce the flash upwards to reduce the dreaded white face of normal flash. It does not however rotate sidways to allow side bounce. It is also not compatible with the CLS that Nikon is famous for. That said, it is much better than the built in flash but does not compare to the sb-600, sb-800, or sb-900. If light weight and low cost are paramount the sb-400 is great, if not at least consider the sb-600 or it's bigger brothers.
B000057DON|5.0|I purchased this LP even though I own the digital version via iTunes.  This LP certainly does sound different.  It sounds, as most people would describe, warmer than the digital version.  It's also a lot more fun to play since it takes manual work to enjoy.  The LP has excellent information on the jacket (lyrics, photos) and is in brand new condition.  All in all, I'm glad I purchased the LP version since I will probably listen to it a lot more this way than from iTunes.  It was a good purchase.
B0019X3ZZY|1.0|I first heard about this film in college, during a sociology of film course.  My professor lauded this film as being a work of genius.  As a lover of political cinema, my curiosity grew and I tried to get a copy, but at over $1,000 dollars, my dreams of seeing this political masterpiece seemed bleak at best.    For years, I scoured the internet with no success.  Salo had become my holy grail.  So you can imagine how excited I was when this was finally re-released.    Anyone who has read my other reviews knows that I usually go into at least a little detail.  However, for the sake of good taste, I wont.  All I will say is that after seeing this film, I was left feeling repulsed, empty, and sick.  The images were so graphic that I could not eat breakfast the next day.  I was so disgusted, I returned the movie.      I can see what Pasolini was trying to accomplish, however, the film seemed more like a childish mockery of fascism rather than a well thought out critique.      When I returned the film, the manager asked me why.  I said to him...\\"If anyone can watch this film more than once, there is something psychologically wrong with them.\\"

B00003CXRM|5.0|[[ASIN:B00003CXRM O Brother, Where Art Thou?]]  I wasn't sure I was going to like this movie.  I LOVED It!  Once I started watching the movie I was glued to it in disbelief.  I laughed so hard I was crying.  To coin an old phrase, the movie is a scream!!!  If you like movies that keep you laughing and on your toes, this is a definite winner.  The movie really takes you back in time, the scenery, language, etc.  The acting is the BEST!  The actors were at their very finest.  Highly recommended.
B001C08RHA|5.0|Morton Downy Jr. plays the lead in a film that transcends the comic genre. He portrays Tony Stark; the creator of Iron Man.  Tony inherited the legacy of his father's company; a weapons manufacturer.  All the core elements of the comic are there. Jarvis is a computer in this one.  Happy Hogan, the chauffeur.  Gweneth Paltrow was extraordinary as Pepper Potts; IM's executive assistant.  Gweneth added dimension to what could have been a throwaway part.  Being his close confidant, she was privy to the issues that needed his attention.  The details of the original were all there.<br /><br />Over forty years of continuity of didn't bog down this story.  Unlike Hulk, Spidey and X-Men, Iron man wasn't one of the more popular characters.  Being true to form, following the comics \\"Demon in a Bottle\\" tale, Tony has a drinking problem.  However, the movie deals with that aspect without turning the character into a joke.<br />Fans of S. H. I. E. L. D.  take note.  There's a surprise in store for you if you watch the end of the credits.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Taylor Swifts, sophmore album \\"Fearless\\" is a must have for any country/pop fan, any age!  It is an awesome follow up to her debut album.  You can't go wrong with this purchase.  All thirteen songs are catchy and infectious.  I haven't found one song on this album where I had to go change the track, it's that good.

B000YABIQ6|4.0|I am amazed about the amount of smoking and drinking going on. I really like all the female characters - January Jones reminds me of Grace Kelly, Christina Hendricks is as delicious as Marilyn Monroe. The intrigues, affairs, and secrets are positively tasty. And yet I can not find one single thing I like about Don Draper. Sure, Jon Hamm is a great actor, and a quite handsome man, but the character is very unlikeable. It is hard to feel sympathy, pity, or compassion toward him. The show is pretty juicy and well worth watching though.

B001DTPZNY|1.0|Aliens and russian psychics are a major misfit for the Indiana Jones movies handled in the usual wooden, badly conceived, ham-fisted Lucasian fashion with Spielberg up-talking the whole crap-fest ... as usual. Seems these hacks just lucked out a couple of times inthe past and are living off of their reputations while mutilating everything that made their previous successes...successes.  The movie itself is non-stop action (basically one long chase scene) which relies heavily on over-the-top CG effects. The few references to the past movies was fun but the reveal at the end is well to add to just about every other review both pro and amateur...sucked (freakin aliens!?). This resembles so much of the really bad B-Movie knock-offs of Indiana Jones in the 80's just with a massively bloated budget. Don't bother with this Star Wars Prequel/War of the Worlds type garbage; download it and stick it to them like they stuck it to Indiana.
B001GKJ2E8|3.0|I really enjoyed the action scenes - shootouts, car chases, etc. But the overall story of the movie is absolutely absurd. The scenes with Wesley and Janice reminded me of Office Space. :)

0440539811|1.0|To be honest, I bought the book many years ago, after it came highly recommended by a friend. I did not read any reviews before I started reading it, because I wanted to keep an open mind. And oh boy, was I in for a surprise. I really, really, really tried to stick to it, but all I could get through was the first 130 pages. I must say that once in a while the narrative is quite interesting, but... Overall, it seems like the book was written by a undermedicated paranoid schizophrenic, who's been smoking something very illegal. I feel very sad and sorry for people, who thought this book was intellectual and profound.
1416594884|3.0|John Le Carre was the true master of the Cold War spy novel. Beginning with [[ASIN:0743442539 The Spy Who Came In from the Cold]],  and contining thorough the Smiley novels, Le Carre has been synonymous with the inner spy, the brooding, betrayed spook who is both entrepreneurial and bureaucratic as the dangerous game is played out.    For years I have wondered, who is the new Le Carre? Sadly, it is not Le Carre.It is not for want of talent or imagination, because this book displays his prodigious talent. It is just not very interesting. I do not think modern day terrorists and their chasers are within Le Carre's world. It is something editors and publishers want, and to some extent the author himself may want, but it does not work on the level we expect.
B0000VAFO0|4.0|Synthesize elements from famous film franchises like \\"The Crow,\\" \\"The Matrix,\\" and \\"Blade\\" to forge a bullet-riddled, revisionist vampires-vs.-werewolves urban war epic, and you'll have a pretty good idea what to expect from the exciting, new, fantasy chiller \\"Underworld\\" (*** out of *****) starring \\"Pearl Harbor\\" beauty Kate Beckinsale. This supercharged but synthetic British horror thriller with R-rated heaps of blood & gore and a touch of Shakespeare plays fast and loose with vampire lore. Not only do the vamps refrain from shape shifting into bats, but also these pale-faced bloodsuckers can stare at their reflections in the mirror! Were that not enough these fangsters don't have to shack up for the day in their caskets. On the other hand, rookie director Len Wiseman and stuntman-turned-scenarist Danny McBride adhere to the lycanthrope legend with no radical departures.<br /><br />Action-packed from the outset, this darkly-lensed, tragic melodrama laid in a rain swept contemporary setting provides enough different things along the way with a couple of major plot revelations to boost \\"Underworld\\" above its formulaic origins. For example, the vampires load their automatic weapons with silver nitrate slugs, while the werewolves pack cartridges filled with ultra-violet light to literally let daylight through their sworn enemies. The special effects sequences that depict the transformation from man into werewolf look super cool, and the sight of these scary creatures hauling butt on the walls in pursuit of their prey make for vivid, memorable images. One especially clever scene shows a werewolf as he uses his bodily powers to pop the bullets out of his wounds!<br /><br />Although it runs a little over two hours, \\"Underworld\\" maintains enough momentum in its melodramatic narrative and features strong enough villains that it entertains you without giving you nightmares. Surprisingly, though it looks like it should have descended from a graphic novel, \\"Underworld\\" boasts no previous source material aside from an original story penned by black stuntman-turned-actor Kevin Grevioux, former \\"Stargate\\" art director Wiseman, and McBride himself. When the bullets aren't thudding noisily in your ears, \\"Underworld\\" features a deafening, industrial-strength, orchestral soundtrack written by ex-Tangerine Dreamer Paul Haslinger with songs written by David Bowie and Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist John Frusciate. Get ready to rock out!<br /><br />Kate Beckinsale plays a super-sexy leather-clad vampire warrior named Selene who cannot kill enough werewolves to satisfy her thirst for vengeance. Vampires and werewolves have been fighting a no-holds-barred civil war for centuries, and the vampires finally appear to have gotten the upper hand over the Lycans. According to Selene, these hideous Lycans wiped out her entire family and would have killed her too had it not been for vampire elder Viktor (Bill Nighy of \\"Hitler's S.S.: Portrait in Evil\\") who saved her life and turned her into a vampire. Meanwhile, as Viktor rests in his tomb, his hand-picked prot&eacute;g&eacute; Craven (Shane Brolly of \\"Impostor\\") appears to have turned traitor to his own kind. Secretly, Kraven has been negotiating a truce behind the scenes with the Lycans who are trying to develop a serum which will enable Lycans and vampires to mate.<br /><br />Naturally, when Selene awakens Viktor and reveals Kraven's insidious plot, all hell breaks loose. Furthermore, it doesn't help matters that the apparently whipped Lycans are far from whipped as Selene learns in an opening shoot-out in a subway tunnel. No, human society doesn't know about the millennium war happening right under their noses, because the vampires and werewolves conceal themselves so well. In fact, the vampires maintain their own blood bank, so they don't have to bleed humans dry. Once a rebellious Selene resurrects Viktor to punish the treacherous Kraven, the action really slams into high gear.<br /><br />Despite Kraven's assurances to the contrary that the werewolves have been eliminated as a threat, Selene sets out to convince Viktor that the werewolves are staging a comeback. Nothing can stop our hardnosed heroine from proving her point, even if she must turn against her own breed. Apparently, the Lycans have found a human, Michael Corvin (Scott Speedman of \\"Duets\\") who can assimilate both vampire and werewolf DNA so as to reproduce. Complications arise when Michael saves Selene's life, and she finds herself attracted to him. In \\"Underworld,\\"<br /><br />Director Len Wiseman, who served as art director not only on the theatrical \\"Stargate\\" but also \\"Independence Day,\\" makes the most of his threadbare $20-million production so that \\"Underworld\\" can compete with the films that inspired it. Set amid gloomy, Gothic castles where the elitist vampires huddle in their fight against evil, \\"Underworld\\" stresses adrenaline-laced action with just enough time out for the exposition to keep audiences on track about who's who. While the characters aren't as substantial as they could be, each shows a different side as the plot approaches its climax. Selene changes from a mindless werewolf killer from the get-go when she learns the truth about her family and the heroic vampire who saved her from sure death. Tucked away in the flashbacks is another story that revolves around the villainous Viktor that explains his hatred of all things Lycan.<br /><br />Surprisingly, for a British-produced movie, \\"Underworld\\" ignores sex, nudity, and romance in favor of bloodletting and mutilation. Although it cannot compare with \\"The Crow,\\" \\"The Matrix,\\" and \\"Blade,\\" \\"Underworld\\"manages nevertheless to carve out a niche of its own, if only because it is a British production. The fact that the Brits were able to produce their own variation on these popular, special effects laden spectacles is reason enough to watch it. Unfortunately, like the vampires here who refuse to countenance interspecies breeding, nearly 90 per cent of American film critics have staked out this well-made thriller because they feel it offers nothing new and lacks the polished production values of those other film franchises. Truth is that getting a large scale action film like \\"Underworld\\" made in England by Englishmen amounts to something like a miracle.<br /><br />While it doesn't look as polished as \\"The Crow,\\" \\"The Matrix,\\" and \\"Blade,\\" \\"Underworld\\" still ranks a good horror thriller that you can sink your teeth into and enjoy for its vitality.ves have been eliminated as a threat, Selene sets out to convince Viktor that the werewolves are staging a comeback.

In \\"Underworld,\\"    Director Len Wiseman, who served as art director not only on the theatrical \\"Stargate\\" but also \\"Independence Day,\\" makes the most of his threadbare $20-million production so that \\"Underworld\\" can compete with the films that inspired it. Set amid gloomy, Gothic castles where the elitist vampires huddle in their fight against evil, \\"Underworld\\" stresses adrenaline-laced action with just enough time out for the exposition to keep audiences on track about who's who. While the characters aren't as substantial as they could be, each shows a different side as the plot approaches its climax. Selene changes from a mindless werewolf killer from the get-go when she learns the truth about her family and the heroic vampire who saved her from sure death. Tucked away in the flashbacks is another story that revolves around the villainous Viktor that explains his hatred of all things Lycan.    Surprisingly, for a British-produced movie, \\"Underworld\\" ignores sex, nudity, and romance in favor of bloodletting and mutilation. Although it cannot compare with \\"The Crow,\\" \\"The Matrix,\\" and \\"Blade,\\" \\"Underworld\\"manages nevertheless to carve out a niche of its own, if only because it is a British production. The fact that the Brits were able to produce their own variation on these popular, special effects laden spectacles is reason enough to watch it. Unfortunately, like the vampires here who refuse to countenance interspecies breeding, nearly 90 per cent of American film critics have staked out this well-made thriller because they feel it offers nothing new and lacks the polished production values of those other film franchises. Truth is that getting a large scale action film like \\"Underworld\\" made in England by Englishmen amounts to something like a miracle.     While it doesn't look as polished as \\"The Crow,\\" \\"The Matrix,\\" and \\"Blade,\\" \\"Underworld\\" still ranks a good horror thriller that you can sink your teeth into and enjoy for its vitality.

B001ECQ75A|4.0|Dreamworks's new film Kung Fu Panda is a hit to be sure, but it didn't deserve as much hype as it was originally given.  When I first heard about Kung Fu Panda, it was being hailed as one of the best movies of the year. I finally got a chance to see it, and it somewhat delivers on these claims.     The movie teaches some great lessons in Dreamworks's creative manner, such as working hard to pursue a dream and never giving up. Another plus was that the movie was almost completely clean of allusions to lewd or immoral behavior, as you are bound to find even in many \\"children's\\" films nowadays.    The only downside was that the storyline was quite predictable from about halfway through the film. That's why I gave the film only 4 stars.  However, that's coming from me; most kids, such as my 5- and 7-year-old cousins, would almost definitely give this movie five stars.
B001EYGOEM|3.0|Taylor Swift really impressed me with her self-titled album mostly because there was a wide variety of songs: from heartbreaks to the sweetest relationship a girl could ever have with a boy. There were a few times that I thought she could improve her vocal skills but her first album was solid. It was a breath of fresh air.    So when the news of her releasing her sophomore album started to buzz, I was excited. Her single \\"Love Story\\" caused me to wish \\"Fearless\\" would be released sooner than November 11th. However, on the day of its release, I listened to song samples on iTunes, and knew that there was no way I was going to purchase \\"Fearless.\\" For sure, songs like \\"Love Story\\", \\"Breathe\\", \\"Change\\", \\"Fifteen\\", and \\"Hey Stephene\\" are definitely hits but the rest? To me, they were boring and slow: not the same Taylor that released her freshman album. If you really listen to the songs, you realize that the lyrics are more mature and full of depth but you can't make it through those songs without wondering if her voice is going to give out at one point: her voice is constantly cracking and never on key. It's distracting: she barely had this problem with \\"Taylor Swift.\\" The song \\"Breathe\\" on \\"Fearless\\" is so good but she does sing on key: that key is her voice range: she's screaming on most of the other songs on this album: like she's straining her voice.     I am very disappointed in \\"Fearless.\\" People say that Taylor Swift is in competition with Carrie Underwood but don't believe them: Carrie Underwood only has released two official albums but \\"Carnival Ride\\" ended up being a bigger hit than \\"Some Hearts\\" because the fans can see the growth and maturity in Carrie's voice as well as songs. Carrie's voice is more mature and solid and she chooses a wide variety of song subjects: such as losing a loved one in a war (\\"Just a Dream\\") or how if one takes a step back to look at the bigger picture, love is all what matters (\\"So Small\\").     Hopefully Taylor Swift can do the same thing on her next album. She's a talented musician and I still am a huge fan of her: but \\"Fearless\\" is a disappointment.
6305744793|5.0|The black and white TV show was hugely well done..and competed well against the equally outrageous Munster's(also in black and white)which had a  more commercial value off the screen.The characters of the movie are so nicely replicated or even reanimated from the original dreary mood of the Addams cartoon of the New Yorker magazine that its almost a shame that it was in color. There are no clunky performances and its a movie for all ages and any time of the year. Elegant and still crazily derailed..Amazing fun.You will get a  very good glimpse of Christina Ricci's future star power as she brings Wednesday Addam's to morose life.

B000UR9T7I|5.0|I'll open by saying I love this movie.<br /><br />I'll continue by adding that I don't understand why some complain about \\"too many villains\\" when that alone captures the very essence of your friendly neighborhood spider-man - he's just a busy guy!<br /><br />All the aspects of the story were powerful and compelling, and I didn't lose interest for one single moment. I loved every minute of \\"Spider-man 3\\" and I'm glad that the finished production turned out the way it did.<br /><br />The Blu-ray presentation of \\"Spider-man 3\\" is fantastic, both visually and acoustically.<br /><br />It's easily a favorite!

B001GQACGO|5.0|This is a remarkable album. She did what Kayne West should have done, a mixture of her original style (which is upbeat and energized) and her more maturing style (slower ballads). She has the vocals to pull both and she does it very well. The lyrics are so deep in itself. She has depth as an artist and I love where she is headed.
B000NJVWTQ|5.0|While some of the earlier remasters, particularly [[ASIN:B000IOM1YG Pyramid]], suffered from a compression of dynamic range in an effort to feel out the mp3 versus redbook compact disc music buying market, the last batch of SONY/BMG remasters by The Alan Parsons Project cater exclusively to those of us concerned with audiophile quality. And that is as it should be because there were only a select few producers who could create a polished gemstone quite like Alan Parsons. While better than many others, the original 1987 Arista compact disc is sterile in comparison to this remaster. The brass section, in particular, has a transistor-like quality to it on the original whereas the remaster sounds convincingly real and full of life. Once again, a tip o' the hat to Sony's Direct Stream Digital sampling from the best source material available. This is one of the best sounding redbook compact discs I have ever heard, even rivaling many Super Audio CDs!<br /><br />The album itself developed from the inspiration songwriter Eric Woolfson experienced upon seeing the singularly unique structural designs of Catalan architect Antonio Gaudi while on holiday in Barcelona. So inspired was Woolfson that he even composed an entire musical, also called GAUDI, that was successfully staged in Germany. While the crown jewel would unquestionably be the lavish [[ASIN:B001HC10DQ La Sagrada Familia]], both [[ASIN:B001HC7846 Closer To Heaven]] and [[ASIN:B001HC3PSY Inside Looking Out]]/[[ASIN:B001HC56HC Paseo De Gracia (Instrumental)]] are almost equally astounding!  Throw into the mix a terrific radio hit like [[ASIN:B001HC784Q Standing On Higher Ground]] and you have a worthy, albeit premature, swansong from The Project. Even [[ASIN:B001HC7850 Money Talks]] which I have been rather cool to receive over the years takes on a whole new life in remastered form.<br /><br />And the bonus material is exceptional! The vocal flourishes of an alternative take on [[ASIN:B001HC785A Money Talks (Chris Rainbow / Percussion Overdubs)]] are just fantastic.  If only there could have been someway to work those into the original! From the live saxophone of Richard Cottle to the vocal overdubs of Chris Rainbow to even a glimpse of Eric Woolfson's humorous vocal stylings on [[ASIN:B001HC56HM Standing On Higher Ground / Losing Proposition (Vocal Experiments)]], the bonus material, to the delight of ardent fans, leaves no stone unturned.  However, the most important bonus track would have to be [[ASIN:B001HC3PU2 La Sagrada Familia (Rough Mix)]] which incontrovertibly proves The Project wasn't just a studio creation; they were keenly adroit musicians who should have touted those talents with more timely touring for all the world to see!ion Overdubs)]] are just fantastic.

B001GJ3VYG|4.0|In my experience, my favourite music takes a little while to love. However music i hear and love instantly grows old very quickly. With Dido's new release I was at first disappointed by samples I heard on Itunes. Once I bought the CD however, I fell in love with it. Every song is just sensational, beautiful, haunting and meaningful. This is another of Did's CD's to last the ages.

B000BTGY1O|4.0|Updated on January 13, 2009 --<br /><br />Why do people who love \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" -- also think it's a bit of a let down?<br /><br />In my view, a lot of people reflexively label director Blake Edwards's picture a \\"classic\\" -- because of just two things -- Audrey Hepburn's appearance, which is indeed iconic -- and the sensational melodic power of \\"Moon River.\\"  I think it's a classic too.<br /><br />The film has a spectacular beginning and a spectacular ending.  But without \\"Moon River\\" -- and without the star power of adorable Audrey -- there isn't much else to propel today's audiences through a series of many dated, mediocre and \\"comedic-but-intended-to-be-satirical\\" scenes.<br /><br />Combine this with the emotional setback that occurs everytime Mickey Rooney's character appears on screen -- one better understands why \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" never makes any film group's list of the \\"top 100\\" films ever made.  Henry Mancini's \\"Moon River\\" score bails out the script many times -- and I find myself more \\"moved\\" by scenes that would otherwise never work.<br /><br />-----<br /><br />However, the two-disc Centennial Collection of \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" is still spectacular -- a vast improvement that stands head-and-shoulders above all single-disc editions previously released on DVD.  While most of the special features have been taken from the [[ASIN:B000BTGY1O single-disc Breakfast at Tiffany's (Special Aniversary Collector's Edition) issued in 2006]] -- there are enough important differences with this new [[ASIN:B001HPP2XW two-disc 2008 Centennial Collection]] -- that make it a \\"must have upgrade\\" for your permanent DVD library.<br /><br />In particular, the audio and video have been remastered -- hence significantly improved to accommodate the aspect-ratio formatting and high-end audio features so prevalent in today's home entertainment systems.  The video isn't Blu-ray -- but it does have more sharpness and clarity than all previous editions.  A glossy souvenir booklet and handsome packaging befitting of this classic -- are included.<br /><br />But best of all -- the special features in the [[ASIN:B001HPP2XW 2008 Centennial Collection edition]] -- both new and old -- have been spread across two-discs in a way that place the significance of \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" in their proper creative and historical context.<br /><br />-----SPECIAL FEATURES-----<br /><br />** \\"Commentary by Producer Richard Shepard\\" -- is the same as what's found on the 2006 DVD -- and is so superb that I'm glad Paramount didn't change it.  Shepard, who brought all of the elements together, including hiring all cast and crew principals -- hits everything out of the ball park with a great mix of enthusiasm and restraint.<br /><br />** \\"A Golightly Gathering\\" -- is a new 20-minute documentary featuring interviews of the surviving \\"little-known\\" cast members in the picture's famous apartment party scene.  These cast interviews were obviously filmed during a \\"anniversary reunion party\\" hosted by Paramount -- and have been interspersed with clips of their scenes.  Everyone is rightly proud of their contributions -- even though in my view, that party scene -- with which Mr. Edwards remains proud because it contains the most creative material for which he can claim credit -- is overrated.  To be fair, the party scene in \\"Tiffany's\\" is reflective of \\"early\\" Blake Edwards.  His later work is better.<br /><br />I don't think the party scene is funny or as pointedly satirical -- as the office party in Billy Wilder's \\"The Apartment\\" -- a comedy which won the 1960 Academy Award for Best Picture during the same year (1961) that \\"Tiffany's\\" was released.  In \\"Tiffany's,\\" the party is too broad and out-of-place from the A+ \\"set-up\\" -- that Mr. Edwards gives us during the film's beautiful first half-hour.  It's always here when I start saying to myself, \\"OK, move it along, we get it.  Please take us back to Audrey's troubles.\\"  But don't let my views discourageyou.  The documentary itself is still great.<br /><br />** \\"Henry Mancini: More Than Music\\" - is a 20-minute documentary that firmly establishes Mancini as one of the greatest composers of the silver screen.  Yes, in my view, he absolutely BELONGS in the same pantheon of Hollywood immortals with Max Steiner, Bernard Herrmann, John Williams, Miklos Rozsa, and Franz Waxman.  I strongly feel Mancini has never been given the credit he deserves because his legacy has been disproportionately defined by his work in \\"Tiffany's\\" and in the \\"Pink Panther\\" series.<br /><br />** \\"Mr. Yunioshi: An Asian Perspective\\" -- is a 17-minute documentary that is NOT a weak accommodation to political correctness.  As an Asian-American who has long been conflicted about \\"Tiffany's,\\" this featurette sling-shots this [[ASIN:B001HPP2XW 2008 Paramount Centennial Collection]] over the moon.  It's very instructive about the acceptance of yellow-face casting, e.g., why it was \\"OK\\" then and why it's \\"not OK\\" now.  It is NOT sanctimonious -- and it does NOT carry a \\"holier-than-thou\\" tone that's so common and irritating from \\"too-sensitive\\" interest groups who want to revise everything they find objectionable in art today.  This documentary is loaded with interviews and film clips that compare yellow-face casting during the decades before the 1960s.  They all have the effect of placing Mickey Rooney's role in better context without excusing it.  It may still be uncomfortable, but Paramount is to be lauded for finally addressing the \\"elephant in the room\\" that \\"Tiffany's\\" critics have loudly complained about for almost 50 years.<br /><br />** \\"Behind the Gates: The Tour\\" - is a four-minute commercial that says, yes, Paramount also has a studio tour.  No, it's not as gigantic as the Universal Studios theme park several miles north -- but the tour of Paramount's lots on Melrose Ave. is less expensive and just as historic.<br /><br />** \\"Galleries\\" - is a mix of old and new -- it's broken up into three sections -- production, movie and publicity.  Hands down, the best stuff is in the \\"production\\" section, because it shows cast and crew members relaxing, working or goofing off on the set.  These are the type of \\"candids\\" that really complete the package.  The stills in the \\"movie\\" and \\"publicity\\" sections could've been combined -- as most of them have been seen elsewhere in press kit photos or on promotional lobby cards.<br /><br />** Five other special features are \\"carry-overs\\" from the 2006 Anniversary Edition:  1) \\"The Making of a Classic\\" -- 2) \\"It's So Audrey:  A Style Icon\\" -- 3) \\"Brilliance in a Blue Box\\" -- 4) \\"Audrey's Letter to Tiffany\\" -- and 5) \\"Original Theatrical Trailer.\\"<br /><br />-----THE FILM-----<br /><br />I think the film version of \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" is about \\"posers\\" of all stripes -- struggling to hide their flaws, their past and their embarrassments -- while searching for something that grounds them.  So we get all this stuff that threads throughout the picture, e.g., Holly \\"doesn't belong to anyone,\\" Holly calls \\"her\\" cat -- \\"Cat\\" -- because it sounds \\"hip\\" and independent.  Holly can be \\"bought\\" for extravagance -- and believes materialism is better than true love.  Leave love for sentimentalists, she seems to say.  She throws away her identity (i.e., the Lula Mae bit) -- for present day pleasures -- and for a future that will include security and prestige.<br /><br />But Holly's behavior betrays her true feelings about the family she left behind -- and betrays the way most young single people feel about love.  (Enter George Peppard as a different type of \\"poser,\\" a kept man, a failed writer who's the voice of reason.  He's a straight-man who doesn't deliver punch-lines.  We instantly want him with Holly.)<br /><br />Even if this is a \\"romantic comedy\\" that's not meant to be deep -- \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" is too slap-sticky in spots when it shouldn't be, and I'm not just talking about Mickey Rooney.  We watch Audrey as a flighty clothes-horse who dismisses love -- going through a lot of silly stuff -- before she finally comes to her senses, recognizing at the end that she indeed has been a phony -- and is tired of being a \\"poser.\\"  She wants love after all.  The rain (and tears) pour down, \\"Moon River\\" swells up, and the film ends happily.<br /><br />But this story doesn't play consistently well on the screen.  Without \\"Moon River,\\" how much less is George Axelrod's script?  (Ironically, Axelrod collaborated with Billy Wilder on the superb adaptation of \\"The Seven Year Itch.\\")  \\"Tiffany's\\" never tops its visually spectacular and moody opening, featuring Audrey amid Manhattan's deserted streets, eating a croissant at dawn, gazing into Tiffany's windows.  Only the scenes of Audrey singing \\"Moon River\\" on the guitar -- and the film's happy ending in the rain -- come close.<br /><br />In sum, \\"Breakfast at Tiffany's\\" is not, in my view, great -- but it is \\"essential.\\"  It is a classic on several levels.  No film better captures the legend of Audrey Hepburn -- and forever links that legend to a tune we can hear repeatedly without complaint.<br /><br />P.S. -- In September 2008, an 87-year-old Mickey Rooney told the Sacramento Bee that in the nearly 50 years since \\"Tiffany's\\" was released -- he had received \\"not one complaint\\" about his performance.  It doesn't matter.  Audiences did laugh at Mr. Rooney in this picture, even though many don't laugh today.  Again, despite my discomfort with his scenes -- applying today's political correctness to the past -- would alter history \\"as it was\\" in 1961.e it shows cast and crew members relaxing, working or goofing off on the set.

0316017922|4.0|\\"Outliers: The Story of Success\\" is well worth reading, especially for folk like myself not entirely familiar with the subject matter.  There were times when I wondered where the author was going with his discussions, but in the end this is a short book that was well worth the time and effort.  The essays may be a too brief for serious reviewers, but they were certainly thought provoking enough for me.  Heartily recommended.
1433502410|5.0|I have recently purchased this ESV study Bible and found it a very helpful and exciting guide in helping me dig deeper into Gods word.  I love the readability of this version and how it is pointed out in notes on every page of different word or phrase interpretations that may be reasonable.  I've found the study notes to be helpful and enlightening while doing my personal Bible Study time also. The easy references to scripture other supporting scriptures is also very handy. A very well done work~!
B000002GKT|5.0|Back in the early days of the seventies I was a CSNY[collectively and individually] fan with my main foci on Neil Young. In high school you get wrapped in musical values and prejudices and just plain ignorance. That perpetrates forward.    I remembered vaguely how strange Eat It was. When I inadvertly stumbled into it on Amazon.com I decided to marry it with Rockin' At The Fillmore.  I was summarily impressed with the reviews.    I'm not a Peter Frampton fan(that is why this confession comes grudgingly), Rockin' At The Fillmore belongs right up there with the other \\"classic\\" live albums of the seventies. It took me many years to get here(owned ABB At Fillmore East, Live At Leeds, and Yessongs in the seventies).     This CD presents a different twist on the truly majestic live concert recording. It's the ambience, the songs they chose to cover, and the guitar interactions between Frampton and Marriot anchored by the solid rhythm bass/drums. The deep grooves are here and the subtle embroidization are evident.    These guys kick butt!
0920668364|5.0|Like others, I choke up with tears every single time I read this, but I also don't think it's truly appropriate for very young children who still don't understand death or have a developed sense of time. I would think this would be appropriate for ages 4-5 and up.<br /><br />That said, I think some of the complaints are misguided: they are missing the story's innocence and the veiled humor in the persistence of the mother. I also think that at some point even children have to learn about death, and what better way than through the story of a mother that loves her child no matter what?<br /><br />However, I want to add another angle: the repetition of the main \\"chorus\\" \\"I'll love you forever, I'll love you for always, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be.\\" As musicians, my wife and I sing these lines to our son, and the repetition of these lines is heightened when sung. You don't have to be an opera diva or even sing in tune, but if you're musically inclined even a little bit, try softly singing it to these pitches (transposed up or down, one note per syllable):<br /><br />I'll love you forever, I'll love you for aways, as long as I'm living, my baby you'll be.<br />G-C-D-E-E-D,  A-D-E-F-F-D,  B-B-C-D-D-B,  B-C-D-E-C.<br /><br />Crazy idea? Maybe, but it makes singing these repeated lines touching rather than boring.<br /><br />All in all, I absolutely love this book and think it's innocence and presentation of the continuity of life through the love parents have for their children transcends any strange implications others are reading into it.
B000E6EHGI|3.0|I actually bought this album on vinyl on the day it came out. This after physically breaking my new copy of Mars Hotel over my knee in front of my high school friend. It sat many a year unplayed until sometime in 1981-82 when I dumped the vinyl.    The Grateful Dead were on hiatus when the all conviened in Bob Weir's studio to cobble this album together. Picture Jon Anderson and Co. trying to make Tales Of Topographic Oceans. I own both versions of this CD: Grateful Dead Records/Rhino remaster/reissue.    My musical horizons have exponentially expanded since I consigned this album to non-play status in the late seventies. Hey, I didn't like Deep Purple's Machine Head at first. It took a Gov't Mule album to re-appraise that album.    Admittedly it took a while for me to fully appreciate this album. Bookended between two rather lengthy suites: the concise \\"Help On The Way/Slipknot!/Franklin's Tower\\" trilogy and the dense audio-verte' 'Music Concrete' \\"Blues For Allah.\\" is \\"King Soloman's Marbles.\\" A natural growth out of \\"Eyes Of The World\\" jams. See Dick's Picks. A little \\"pop\\" confection by Bob Weir called: \\"The Music Stopped\\" and the rather oblique Garcia/Hunter composition: \\"Crazy Fingers.\\" \\"Sage & Spirit is a simple Bob Weir instrumental. Effective.    I'm rather perplexed that I still have the Grateful Dead Records 1990s version around. Other then it's a nice 40 min play in a pinch. But the scholarly version is the Rhino remaster/reissue. And the strange outtakes make this CD all the more fun.    I did eventually learn to appreciate this CD for what it is: A closer live Dead attempt to convert their sound in the studio. \\"Blues For Allah\\" waxes and wanes by turns. A naseant \\"Dark Star\\" replacement? Wake Of The Flood started a whole new re-definition of Grateful Dead improvisation. Blues For Allah takes Wake Of The Flood's enuciations and converts them. And this is stated Grateful Dead dogma. Nothing new here.    The reissue explores some new territory that most of the Grateful Dead afflicted can easily pick out. Hints of \\"Fire On The Mountain?\\" After all isn't \\"Scarlet Begonias\\" and \\"Fire On The Mountain\\" the same song with different changes, time signatures, and lyrics? Just like the relationship between \\"Uncle John's Band\\" and \\"Playing In The Band\\".    Yeah. Buy this CD if you dare!?!    p.s.: Gets three Stars because the live versions of most of this material are far superior to the studio versions presented here. But what does three stars really mean? What is the definition of is?
B0017MO10U|5.0|Having been a huge fan of Stargate when Richard Dean Anderson was still involved, I loved the return to classic Stargate battle to save Earth from the Goulds.  I wasn't a fan of the Ark of Truth--and was hesitant to watch Continuum.  I am very glad I did.  There were many beautifully written scenes throughout, Landry's speech, Daniels attempting to contact himself, the President, the full lineup of the classic Goulds of the past, including Apophus and Ra (from the Stargate movie).  What a treat!
B000071K5L|5.0|To Kill A Mockingbird is regarded as a time-honoured classic for its moral message of equality and preventing the innocent from being corrupted. Harper Lee does this very well, displaying how a small, rural town thought to be the perfect symbol of purity and excellence can, in a matter of days, turn into the epitome of a scum-filled town consisting of hypocrites. Now, although she writes a very good novel, the some of the characters she uses to do this are not great representations of her almost perfect novel. Mr. Bob Ewell is one example that ruins the believability and the ability to enjoy the novel. But, Lee's great story, main characters and timeless message prove this book to be one of the greats of the Twentieth Century.      The novel To Kill A Mockingbird is thought of as one of the best modern novels about racism and purity. Harper Lee certainly holds the problems of the society during the Nineteen Thirties and the Great Depression up to the metaphoric light and exposes the deep-seeded racism. In her novel, Harper Lee describes her focus town, Maycomb, Alabama, as \\"... an old town, but it was a tired old town when I first knew it. In rainy weather the streets turned to red slop . . . [s]omehow it was hotter then . . . bony mules hitched to Hoover carts flicked flies in the sweltering shade of the live oaks on the square. Men's stiff collars wilted by nine in the morning. Ladies bathed before noon, after their three-o'clock naps, and by nightfall were like soft teacakes with frostings of sweat and sweet talcum. . . . There was no hurry, for there was nowhere to go, nothing to buy and no money to buy it with, nothing to see outside the boundaries of Maycomb County. But it was a time of vague optimism for some of the people: Maycomb County had recently been told that it had nothing to fear but fear itself.\\" In this description, she shows the slow moving pace of her hot, little rural town. But underneath this fictional, almost typical, `Thirties town lies a deep, dark secret: a prevalent feeling of racism. Minus select people, most of the townspeople have an feeling superiority over the common African-American citizens. According to Jean Louise (A.K.A. Scout), the novel's protagonist, \\"I heard...[Miss Gates, a citizen of Maycomb] say it's time somebody taught `em a lesson, they were gettin' way above themselves, an' the next thing they think they can do is marry us.\\" Throughout the novel, signs of racism appear and whittle down to a court case in which a obviously innocent African-American is accused and convicted of raping a white woman, a charge that eventually leads to his death. Maycomb's ugly racism, as shown by actions and words from minor characters,  portrays the extremely racist society of the Nineteen Thirties.       Harper Lee also took the metaphor of the title of her book, To Kill A Mockingbird, and used it as a common theme throughout her novel. Jean Louise learns this when she states, \\"`Remember it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.'\\" That was the only time I ever heard Atticus say it was a sin to do something, and I asked Miss Maudie about it. `Your father's right,' she said. `Mockingbirds don't do one thing but make music for us to enjoy . . . but sing their hearts out for us. That's why it's a sin to kill a mockingbird.'\\" This action, the killing of a mockingbird, is metaphoric for the loss of innocence due to another's actions. During the length of her novel, this theme appears many times. This goes from the very small, the killing of a \\"Roly-Poly\\" [Armadillidium], to a larger scale of a man's innocence, such as the death of the accused African-American rapist and the almost exposure of a legend-filled recluse on the outskirts who preforms a heroic deed. This theme is one of the most major and important in the novel.     On the polar opposite end of the greatest characters in this novel, Mr. Bob Ewell is the stain on the face of Maycomb that not even the citizens like. Comparatively, Ewell is just a more radical form of the common citizen: über-racist and more uneducated than all the rest. In this novel, Bob Ewell is shown as a despicable character, cheating the Government out of relief checks during the Great Depression, harassing the local African-Americans and even going as far as to convince his daughter to accuse one of them of rape to cover up Bob's beating. His terrible demeanor is most clearly seen through his final act, to attempt to harm the Finch children. His ability to mentally handle the harassment of innocent victims proves that he is a horrible individual. But, in her attempt to personify Mr. Ewell, Harper Lee overdoes it quite a bit. His over-the-top actions and his coldheartedness are a little too stressed in her novel, and distracts the reader from the main plot of the novel by introducing him in little, completely meaningless, subplots. He takes away from the ability to enjoy the novel knowing that around the corner comes another Ewell escapade which will obviously not end in his favor. If altered a bit, his character could help the book's progression instead of taking away from it.     When looked at as a whole, Harper Lee's To Kill A Mockingbird is a brilliant work of historical fiction that has the ability to greatly alter the life of almost any reader. Her themes and morals shine through in this novel and expose the bad qualities of life during the Great Depression. Although some of her characters take away from the premise of the novel, they do not block out the strength of her message that will ring true throughout time.

0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has done an excellent job in explaining the backgrounds and events leading to success in life. He emphasizes on hard work, cultural and family values,  and being there at the right place at the right time as the key factors. And he demolishes the myth of a \\"self made person\\" or high IQ persons  dominating the successful group of persons.    There are myriad factors contributing to a person's success. He quotes that the tallest Oak tree in the forest is the tallest not because it grew from the hardest acorn, because no other trees blocked its sunlight, the soil around it was deep and rich, no rabbit chewed thru its bark as a sampling, no lumberjack cut it down before it matured.     Like the examples he quoted about working for 10,000 hours to become really proficient in any field. Like Beatles performing upto eight hours a day in Berlin for a few years. And Bill Joy and Bill Gates spending lots of time programing computers. Of the three books he wrote so far (The Tipping Point and Blink are the other two), this is easily his best work. Probably because, like his theory, he spent more than 10,000 hours writing other articles and books ! Another example is the case of Kids who are exhorted by their middle or upper class parents to study and engage themselves in academic activities during summer vacation, gain significantly while the others who do nothing come out as loosers.     He explains the Mathew effect which deals with cutoff dates and distribution of birth months of the selected people for any subgroup. In Canadian hockey league, the cutoff date is Jan 1. A significant number of players are January born and very fewer of them are December born. The people born in January are physically and mentally more matured than the ones in December because the latter are about a year younger. At young ages, one year of age difference makes a big difference. The older kids start off with a bit of advantage. And that gets amplified because of their selectionand better coaching, more facilities etc.     He states that beyond a certain threshold, IQ does not contribute much to a person's success. And cites the study of Lewis Terman at Stanford which selected a group of high IQ kids and followed their life. None of this group made it to the top like winning a Nobel Prize. And probably not so surprisingly, two of the eventual Nobel prize winners  William Shockley and Luis Alvarez were rejected by Terman while they were kids and he was selecting his elite group, on grounds of insufficient IQ !    He traces the backgrounds of some of the most successful Jewish lawyers in New York. Through the origins of their forefathers being involved in garment making in European countries. The forefathers became successful immigrants doing meaningful work of garment manufacturing and sent their children to very good schools and colleges. And more importantly these lawyers took up mergers and acquisitions which the WASP lawyers did not touch. As the mergers and acquisitions took off in the 1970s, the Jewish lawyers were at the right place at the right time to exploit the opportunity and climb the ladder.    He talks about another group of people whose cultural background made their descendents very successful. The rice farmers from the Pearl Delta of South China. These farmers are the most hard working, making use of small tracts of lands diligently to produce the most rice per acre. And using the off season time like winters to involve in other productive activities like planning. Their descendents are very successful in Math and made it to the top Universities in US.    He quotes a couple of airline crashes which happened due to the pilots coming from a cultures which are deferential to age and authority. A Columbian airliner which crashed a few miles short of JFK due to fuel exhaustion. The crew in this case were not aggressive enough in explaining their dire situation, caused by stormy weather and its consequent enroute delays, to theAmerican air traffic controllers. And a Korean airliner which crashed into a mountain in Guam in bad weather. Presumably because the pilot did not question his Captain, due to a cultural barrier. Korean airlines later trained its crew to be proficient in English, the universal language of air traffic control, and to be very aggressive in questioning authority. And there has been no crash since then.      Finally, he himself proves to be an Outlier (a statistical observation that is markedly different in value from the others in a sample) due to a strong work ethic and cultural values espoused by his Jamaican parents and forefathers.

B001F2W4Y2|4.0|This isn't rocket science. They aren't trying to create the next great masterpiece. After 30 years of listening to AC/DC, I know what to expect with each release; AC/DC sounding like....AC/DC. There's no mystery here. They aren't fixing what's not broken.<br /><br />If you want to stomp your feet and just listen to fun rock and roll, AC/DC is your band. If you want to hear Metallica out-do their last album, they are your band. And I like them, too.<br /><br />I love this album. I knew what I was getting when I bought it. If you are still buying AC/DC after all these years and are surprised and ticked off at what you got, then you need to stop supporting them and quit complaining.<br /><br />In the meantime, my feet are stomping as I type this to a great, fun new album by AC/DC. Rock on, guys, and thanks.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|This had all of the possibilities of another great Indiana Jones movie.  The startup was very good, and the plot was looking interesting.  Then in plopped Shia LaBoef.  His character, although mildly interesting, was pretty useless.  The quest was good with all of the usual fighting on cars stuff.  Unfortunately it ends with a ridiculous reincarnation of the long dead aliens when the skull is returned.  It was worth watching, but not of the some quality as the Harrison Ford and Sean Connery team.  Karen Allen was very good in her supporting role.  Cate Blanchett and her role were over-rated.  Harrison Ford delivered, but the story faded to fantasy-land.
B001AJVR5M|5.0|Love bug is my favorite song ever!I used to sit around in my room listening to High School Musical Cds on my Cd player but ever since I got this Cd its like the only thing I listen to!

B0013D8LCW|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It's much more than a love story; its also a coming of age story that's filled with inclusive family values.  The movie has some great scenes of surfing and skateboarding, as well as \\"bombing\\" the suburbs with graffiti art.  In many respects, the movie combines various subcultures in a new and innovate hybridized form.  Surfing, graffiti, and the gay world meet and intermingle in this novel refreshing film.  The love scenes and the kissing are so tender.  The emotions of the actors are so intense that I felt as though I was a participant in the movie.  I was not merely a spectator, but was involved in this film completely.  Seeing Zach's evolution was truly uplifting and inspiring.  This is not simply a \\"gay film.\\"  This is the kind of film that anyone and everyone should see.  No matter what your sexual orientation, you should definitely see this movie.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|Yes, it's long. SO long in fact that it never made theaters in the US. It was the longest running film in theaters in France. If you can appreciate the cinematography, it's amazing. This is the kind of flick that you would like if you like Citizen Kane.

0061537934|4.0|The author's choice of making the dog the narrator was refreshing.  It takes a bit of an adjustment at the beginning of the book, but once you get into it you can identify with the dog.  The dog is loyal, fair, a concrete thinker, and has wisdom to share without the ability of the spoken word.   The book was difficult to put down.  It merges a dog, family, and racing.  The dog's intellect and primitive instincts were thought provoking.   Definitely a book to read for the story line and to do some reflective thinking. Would be a great book reading group choice.
B000QEIORG|5.0|While the Foo Fighters have seen their popularity grow as time progresses, this album is by far their masterpiece.
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell has done it again.  His new book Outliers is well worth the read and is already #9 of all books on the USA Today bestseller list.  Outliers  brilliantly challenges our assumptions about success.  It makes my short list of stimulating reads about success.  It is extraordinary for a growing a global perspective by learning new insights about success in other cultures.   Gladwell again comes up with stimulating and surprising examples that are thought provoking and help develop our lateral thinking.  It is a great book to inspire us to get better and rethink our level of play and effort.  I was particularly moved by the concept that it takes 10,000 hours to master success.  Another unlikely insight I gained was about educating my grandchildren and helping them step up to the future. Well done Malcolm.
B00000G3PA|5.0|People love to dump on this movie...namely for the unrealistic plot and action.  The first time I saw this it was in the theater and I felt like everyone else...I was dissapointed and it just felt like a big letdown.<br /><br />However, this movie has grown on me like no tomorrow.  Forget the plot and how its totally unrealistic.  This movie has some of the best and funniest dialogue.  It you watch the Gag Reel on the Criterion edition you'll see how much fun the actors had making this.  The dialogue in this movie is funnier than most comedies out there, you just have to ignore the plot and pay attention to it.  The humor is very dry and the characters all gel really well together.  Its the little lines that make this movie..like when Bruce Willis is having an argument with his daughter, and to distract the Japanese clients that are visiting he says \\"look at those nice pipes up there\\".  Its said so quickly that I didn't catch it after the first few viewings.<br /><br />Give the movie a chance if you're on the fence about it...it really is entertaining.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|Great album! I like each and every track...I haven't taken it out of my cd player since the release date. My favorites are Come Back To Me, Avalanche, Heroes, Declaration, Barbasol, Kiss On The Neck, & Light On. David Cook has out done himself, no wonder he is heatin' up the charts!     (New York - NY) - David Cook enters the Billboard charts at 3 with his self-titled debut album (19 Recordings / RCA Records) selling 279,578 units. The Rob Cavallo produced album is also the 1 album on the digital album chart and is the best debut from an American Idol winner since 2006.      \\"Light On\\", the first single from the album, has been dominating the AOL Top 40 Songs chart at 1 for the past 6 weeks and is currently 1 on the ClearChannel On Demand Chart. It was also the 1 gainer at adult radio and debuted as the breakout track on this week's American Top 40 with Ryan Seacrest. In late September \\"Light On\\" premiered on AOL Music's pop culture news site, PopEater.com, receiving over 1 million plays in less than week.     The ClearChannel premiere of the Wayne Isham directed \\"Light On\\" video became their best performing video premiere ahead of Linkin' Park, The Eagles and Ne-Yo.     American Idol single \\"The Time Of My Life\\" (which is featured as a bonus track on David Cook) has reached platinum status with over 1 million tracks sold.
B001F0VHEM|5.0|I have been a Pink fan since she first came out.....i am a little obsessive. All of her albums just keep getting better and better....I thought I'm not dead was the best cd ever and now so if funhouse! I listen to it constantly, ever track is great....If you're a pink fan you know, she cant do wrong! I love the emotional songs like I Dont Believe You and Crystal Ball, her voice is so raw and beautiful. The lyrics in crystal ball are amazing, about her not being afraid for what her future holds. Bad inlfuence, Ave May A, One Foot Wrong, Funhouse are awesome, Mean (her country song) is awesome, i dont need to list the rest, every song is AWESOME!!!!!

1567184855|4.0|I just finished reading this book.  I read Life Between Lives a little while ago.  This is a much better read, in my opinion.  Newton gives a lot of information and its obvious that he cares deeply about his work.  I've just read some of the critical as well as the complimentary reviews here and it strikes me that some folks are inherently open to this kind of material and some are inherently sceptical.  Perhaps a few are on the fence and this book will convince them.  For those who insist on \\"science\\" and \\"proof\\" they may not find what they're looking for here.    I've read widely in the field and have studied and practiced past life regression so obviously I'm a true believer.  Newton's focus on the interlife is relatively new although many \\"traditional\\" regressionists have included the interlife while doing their past life regressions.  I give him enormous credit for this huge body of work which has spanned decades and includes many sessions.  His contribution to this field is vast and very significant.    The conclusions that he draws from these sessions are deeply spiritual and ultimately very encouraging.  He claims not to be a religious person and goes to some length to avoid using traditional religious terminology but the findings certainly support the teaching of great spiritual traditions of the ages: karma, reincarnation, the Golden Rule.  There is justice in the order of the Universe, according to these teachings and Newton's findings support that.      I could quibble about some of the details of his findings as they do differ from others I've studied and from what I've seen in my own practice.  However I give the man enormous credit for his contribution to the study of human consciousness.

B000YABIQ6|3.0|I was really looking forward to this series after reading the rave reviews but I have to say I was disappointed by this tepid view of the heyday of advertising.  The series certainly scores high style marks but substance is woefully lacking in this rather narcissistic view of 1960 Madison Avenue.  Once past the good looks, crisp lines and jaunty banter, I found myself wondering \\"where's the beef?\\"  The directors seem to revel in this decidedly man's world where women seem little more than muses, except for Peggy Olsen who finds herself quickly rising up the ladder with her honest view of products.<br /><br />The firm of Sterling & Cooper comes across as a sexist bastion during a time when many women were breaking through such barriers.  You get the sense that Peggy is a younger version of Helen Gurley Brown who had worked herself up from the mailroom of the William Morris Agency to become one of the highest paid ad copywriters of the early 60s, eventually taking over Cosmopolitan and turning it into the magazine we know today.  Sexism was pervasive at the time, but this show seems to revel in it, with little sense of irony.<br /><br />The episodes are painfully slow and Don Draper is painfully boring.  It takes 12 excrutiating episodes to find out about his hidden past, which in the end doesn't appear to make the slightest impact on the story as Cooper dismisses Peter Campbell's revelatory scene out of hand.  Seems Don Draper can do no wrong, although he appears to have an increasingly hard time at home as his lovely wife Betty comes apart at the seams like Sylvia Plath in the Bell Jar.<br /><br />After 12 episodes, I feel like I've had enough, although fans of this series keep telling me how things pick up in season two.  Maybe so, but the first season didn't do much for me.
B0013D8LCW|4.0|I knew a film maker who died very suddenly and I remember thinking: \\"What does a film maker leave behind?\\" This thought was the seed that sprouted the movie: Beatific Vision.    I found myself thinking of a secret film that a character would leave behind when he dies. Not one he wished not to be found but one he planned to be found. More than a final will and testament this film was a \\"Beatific Vision\\", a view into the future of all characters and a clear mapping of the coincidences that would occur.    As I began to write the screenplay the voice of the Angel started to speak softly and occasionally. Upon many re-writes the Angel voice was vieing for main character status. I tried to reel in the angel but he (Angel Chad) wrestled control away from me.    When another close friend was passing to the other side, she added a strong dose of acceleration to the writing process. There now are so many Angels (most recently my Mother) involved, I feel I am at best the living hands to this project.    When I was a small boy my parents used to call me: Angel Michael when they wanted my behavior to change. I actually grew up thinking I was an angel including my sprouting scapula wings. Today, I do not think I am an angel but I surely believe that I am their vehicle for expression on earth.    Thank-you angels for this \\"angels on earth\\" experience!    [...]

031606792X|5.0|I believe that this book series was tied together very well. Breaking Dawn was a beautiful finish to the wonderful series. The birth of Renesme was both riveting and heart-breaking. Stephanie Meyer painted pictures so vivid, you almost felt like your in the book. The banding of vampires was both interesting as well as unsettling. Throughout the book, the author continues to combine conflicting emotions together;; interest and suspense;; understanding with stupidity aka Bella protecting Renesme even though she is killing her. This book was so well written I'm so confused why fans are upset.
0307454886|4.0|As noted author Philip Roth has gotten older, so have his main characters, which lead to the themes of aging, death, and diminished capabilities that now predominate in his novels. David Kepesh, a noted NYC university professor, conducts a senior seminar in critical writing called Practical Criticism. The course is a chick magnet which accords perfectly with Kepesh's near obsession with beautiful younger women. He has an uncanny ability to know which girl in a class is predisposed to becoming intimate with him at the conclusion of the course.<br /><br />Kepesh had led a conventional life through the 1950s, including being married. But he was profoundly affected by the revolutionary openness of the 60s and was determined to escape a past where men were forced to \\"cajole, beg, flatter, or insist\\" on intimacy. It was a time when neither men nor women \\"had any sense of an erotic birthright.\\" In his view, marriage for men was \\"like priests going into the Church: they take the vow of chastity, only seemingly without knowing it until three, four, five years down the line.\\"<br /><br />At age sixty-two, Kepesh is totally stunned when twenty-four-year-old Consuela Castillo, an elegant, buxom beauty, shows up in one of his seminars. She becomes his mission in life. At first glance, his dealings with his selected female students seem completely exploitative or one-sided. However, in his view relationships are \\"not fifty-fifty like a business transaction. It's the chaos of eros we're talking about.\\" There is not much doubt that his relationship with Consuela over the next year and half demonstrates clearly her power advantage. \\"To give oneself over intimately to a much, much older man provides this sort of younger woman with authority of a kind she cannot get in an arrangement with a younger man. She gets both the pleasures of submission and the pleasures of mastery.\\"<br /><br />But having a relationship with such an exquisite creature is not unproblematical for Kepesh. The inescapability of her youthfulness and his aging are always present. The worry that it could all end suddenly engenders a scarcely concealed jealousy, as well as a tendency to want to precipitate an early end to the affair. However, for Kepesh, such intimacy is \\"the revenge on death. Don't forget death. ... Yes, intimacy is limited in its power. But tell me, what power is greater?\\" One wonders whether Kepesh is going to have some adaptability issues when he truly becomes elderly.<br /><br />For many, Kepesh's obsessions may seem disgraceful; obviously different avenues are chosen by other older individuals to keep feeling alive. But such a response does not delegitimize the work. Kepesh clearly demonstrates his humanity in his behavior towards Consuela some eight years later when she calls upon him for support in her battle against a serious form of cancer - hardly the actions of one who felt taken advantage of. Roth continues to be a writer that explores so well the disconnect between our prurient interests and our social constructs that constrain our abilities to achieve satisfying intimacy.

B00005J6UR|5.0|Don't expose them to sunlight. Don't let them get wet. And under no circumstances feed them after midnight.<br /><br />Those are the rules for the now-legendary mogwai, adorable little fuzzballs who transform if you break the last rule. And \\"Gremlins\\" is a gloriously unconventional Christmas movie -- a postcard-pretty view of suburban middle-America, splattered with gore, nasty little gremlins and a truly wicked sense of humour (expressed often in movie send-ups).<br /><br />Randall (Hoyt Axton) spots a tiny adorable creature -- a mogwai -- in a small Chinatown shop, and wants to buy it as a Christmas present for his son. The owner refuses, but his grandson secretly sells it to Randall.<br /><br />Randall's son Billy (Zach Galligan) is delighted by the fuzzy lightphobic mogwai, whom he names Gizmo. But it soon becomes clear that Gizmo is full of surprises: when water is accidentally splashed on him, he spontaneously generates a litter of NEW mogwai. The ringleader \\"Stripe\\" tricks Billy into feeding them after midnight, transforming them into scaly, dangerous \\"gremlins.<br /><br />And after a gremlin tumbles into a pool, Billy realizes that the town is about to be swarmed with them -- attacking vicious old Mrs. Deagle, ramming snowplows, murdering kindly teachers, and trashing a tavern with Billy's love interest Kate (Phoebe Cates). As the town descends into gremlinized chaos, the two humans (and Gizmo) must find a way to wipe out the horde... and if they miss only one, it'll start all over again.<br /><br />Personally I find most Christmas movies a little too sappy and sentimental. So for people who feel that way, a Yuletide horror/comedy is simply ideal -- it's sort of a mad hybrid of early Peter Jackson splattergore, Frank Capra snow-sprinkled Christmastime, and a bunch of sly movie homages and send-ups (\\"Forbidden Planet,\\" \\"Wizard of Oz\\" and \\"Snow White\\" amongst others).<br /><br />But the real fun is in watching the movie's balance between nasty and cuddly -- Joe Dante happily veers between sweet moments and grotesquely funny violence (such as Billy's mom messily killing gremlins with a variety of kitchen implements), with the best example being the malevolent Mrs. Deagle being flung out an upstairs window by fa-la-la-la-LAing gremlins. Completely sick, and gutsplittingly funn.<br /><br />And Dante sprinkles it with more G-rated comedy that borders on cartoonish without quite crossing, such as the kid in the Christmas tree costume (\\"Don't ask!\\") and the gremlins destroying a local pub when they aren't watching Disney movies (is this a message about Disney?). It all climaxes in some literally explosive showdowns with the gremlins -- and particularly with Stripe, their ghastly little leader.<br /><br />Galligan and Cates are thoroughly solid as the teenage heroes, especially when Cates gives her heartbreaking speech about the horrible experience that made her hate Christmas. In fact, all the actors do a solid job -- the evil old landlady who serves as a sort of Wicked Witch of the West/Scrooge hybrid, the cranky old veteran, the crackpot inventor and the wise old Chinese guy.<br /><br />But the showstopper is Gizmo -- tiny, round, fuzzy and wide-eyed, with a babyish squeaky voice and a liking for toy cars and 3-D glasses. Rarely has a puppet been so bloody cute and endearing. His complete opposite is Stripe, a gremlin amongst gremlins -- malevolent and gleefully sadistic, he seems smart enough to revel in the idea of destroying the town.<br /><br />\\"Gremlins\\" is a brilliant horror/comedy that infuses a perfect American town with a little mayhem and gore, as well as some wickedly funny little nasties.

0920236162|5.0|The Paper Bag Princess, by Robert Munsch, is a must for any girl's library. On the first page, we are introduced to Elizabeth, a princess who lives in a castle with expensive princess clothes, who is going to marry a prince named Ronald. Then comes the shocker on the next page: \\"Unfortunately, a dragon smashed her castle, burned all of her clothes with his fiery breath, and carried off Prince Ronald.\\"<br /><br />Princess Elizabeth has to wear a paper bag as she goes off to rescue her prince. For most of the book, she uses her brain to outwit the dragon and rescue Ronald. But instead of thanking his rescuer, he haughtily scolds her for her unkempt appearance and tells her to come back \\"when you are dressed like a real princess.\\"<br /><br />Elizabeth realizes that he may look like a prince, but he doesn't have the heart of one, and the book concludes with a picture of her skipping off happily into the sunset with the line, \\"They didn't get married after all.\\" I love Munsch for planting the seed with little girls that they should never settle for a man who isn't good enough for them. Yeah!
1590710037|5.0|I had seen the book The War of Art: Winning the Inner Creative Battle by Steven Pressfield recommended by quite a few experts in the field of creativity and productivity.  I finally got around to putting it on hold at the library, and I eventually worked my way to the top.  That should tell you something considering the book was released in 2002, and it still had a hold backlog.  After finishing it (it's not very long), I'll be buying my own copy for reference.  I felt as if I was looking at myself on most of the pages.<br /><br />Contents:<br />Book One: Resistance - Defining the Enemy<br />Book Two: Combating Resistance - Turning Pro<br />Book Three: Beyond Resistance - The Higher Realm<br /><br />Pressfield's premise is that resistance is our enemy that fights and prevents us from living the life and becoming the person we want to be.  Most observations occupy just a page or two, with titles like Resistance and Trouble and Resistance Never Sleeps.  The style is reminiscent of the book The Art of War (hence, the title...), and the flow progresses from identifying how resistence affects your creativity and progress, to how being a professional means going to war against resistance every day, to accepting the existence of \\"muses\\" that will appear and help you create if you put in the time and effort to be professional and fight resistance.  Since Pressfield is a writer, you often see examples centering around that particular creative outlet.  But in reality, these concepts apply to all creative pursuits.<br /><br />Since I tend to relate well to the concept of \\"going to war\\" with elements in your life that hold you back, The War of Art resonates with me.  Add to that a real problem I have with resistance, and this book felt like it was written explicitly for me.  On top of understanding and relating to the effects of resistance, I also thoroughly understood and accepted the concept of \\"going pro\\".  Think of it being a soldier who doesn't whine and complain about how things are.  They simply do their jobs, commit to excellence in their core skills, and know that the creativity muses will show up if they've done their part in the process.<br /><br />This is another example of a book addressing an area of my life at the exact time I'm struggling with it.  I'll be ordering my own copy of The War of Art and internalizing many of the concepts.  I'll then be able to close the gap between the life I live and the life I could be living, if only I didn't succumb to resistance on a regular basis.jobs, commit to excellence in their core skills, and know that the creativity muses will show up if they've done their part in the process.

B000YABIQ6|5.0|Mad Men is an absolute masterpiece. I agree 200% with all the rave reviews here.     I'm not going to add to the ample reviews of this show. Instead, I would like to comment on the generous extras included in the DVD set.     I debated a long time before buying the DVDs since I own the season on iTunes. I'm glad I bought the DVDs -- the commentaries and extras make it worth every penny.     Each episode has at least one commentary track, usually two separate commentary tracks. And there are other extras - a 20-minute piece, \\"Advertising the American Dream\\", a 10-minute video on scoring Mad Men, and the hour-long 'Establishing Mad Men'--all excellent.    A word about the commentaries -- the ones by creator and writer Matt Weiner are superb, very insightful and interesting. I haven't listened to all the other commentaries yet. Of the ones I have listened to, Weiner's are definitely the best, Vincent Kartheiser, January Jones, and Jon Hamm also provide interesting depth. The brilliant costume designer Janie Bryant also provides wonderful commentary.     I wish some of the other commentaries had been edited, though. For instance, in Jon Hamm's, January Jones', and Elizabeth Moss' commentary on the last episode, 'The Wheel', Elizabeth Moss' comments on the padding used to show her weight gain. This is an interesting aside, but Moss' commentary goes on far too long and it's all trivial, with no insights into Peggy's character. She repeats the same stories again and again--for well over 10 minutes. Her commentary drones through an important part of the Draper story (Don looking at old photos of his brother). It's a shame that we miss Hamm's commentary during that emotionally moving portion of the episode.       But that's my only criticism, one small quibble. The DVD set is marvelous and if you're a Mad Men fan it will add substantially to your enjoyment and insight into the show.

0385339682|3.0|John Grisham is one of my favorite authors; however, I was a little disappointed in this novel.  The storyline was basically good, nonetheless, somewhere in the middle of the book; he strays off the subject and wastes a lot of unnecessary time and pages on subjects not really relevant to the main storyline i.e., visiting every church in the county and the history of same.  The murder and subsequent trial and the background information of Clanton, Mississippi in the 70's was very good reading and I believe had he stuck with the main plot of jury, trial and revenge, I definitely would have given the novel at least four stars.  His friendship with Miss Callie and the Ruffin clan was heartwarming, yet again, he put too much into the problems of Sam and his unfortunate affair, adding nothing to the main plot of the story.  There was entirely too much irrelevant verbiage on unrelated subjects.  I also felt that after spending quite a bit of time explaining how rough and tough and revengeful the Padgitt family was, the resolution to the antagonist of the story came much too easily.  I am not giving up on Mr. Grisham, because I have read many an excellent novel by him; however, \\"The Last Juror\\" did not meet the high standard of work that I expect from a Grisham novel.

031606792X|2.0|From a discussion with author Stephenie Meyer on \\"Breaking Dawn\\":<br /><br />\\"I really don't know why my book has gotten the response that it has.  I'm not sure what it is that drives readers to be so excited about the characters.\\"<br /><br />Stephenie, color me confused as well.<br /><br />This fourth and supposedly final book in Meyer's wildly popular Twilight Saga continues with these same tumultous characters and contains plot twists that are insanely ridiculous.  It begins with Edward and Bella's extravagant wedding, leading up to their honeymoon on a privately owned island where they finally - and VERY carefully - consummate their relationship.  Where the story goes from here becomes a melodrama the likes of which I've never read and to express my utter amazement at how LUDICROUS it gets would reveal too many plot points.  All I'm going to say is that whoever dares to go forward with \\"Breaking Dawn\\" after the last three installments may, as they come to the end, wish they'd never started reading the series.  By the time I reached the end of Chapter 22 (Promised), I was ready to put the book down and dismiss it as worse than the most outrageous soap opera (think of a much more convoluted version of \\"Passions\\" with vampires, werewolves and demon spawn thrown in and you're pretty close).  However, I forced myself through to the end on account that I don't like to think of myself as a quitter, only to feel strangely dissatisfied when Meyer's so-called happy ending played itself out after an exhausting 754 pages.<br /><br />The only thing that sets \\"Breaking Dawn\\" apart from Books 1-3 is Meyer's decision to switch voices a third of the way through and tell the story from Jacob's perspective for a little over 200 pages.  Bella is still her irritating self, so expect little personal grownth and persistent annoyance on that front.  Edward isn't really one to be sympathized with either, even though his sound judgment is drowned out by Bella's utter selfishness.  In the eyes of most of the characters (and readers too), Rosalie becomes Public Enemy #1 after some shocking news gets broken, though she was never much of a likeable character to begin with.<br /><br />Things for Jacob Black have never come easy ever since he haphazardly fell in love with Bella in Book 2 and Meyer manages to make everything a living hell for him here with a few shameless and brazen strokes of her crooked imagination.  As if his being lovesick wasn't enough of an emotional hangup, Meyer does him one worse midway through the book with this whole \\"imprinting\\" thing that his people are subject to, a sick joke on her part.  You'd think the author had some sort of personal vendetta that was being sought vicariously through his character's suffering.  Were he able to physically manifest, I've no doubt he'd grab hold of her throat and dispatch her quickly with those hulking extremities he calls hands out of revenge for such a grievous existence.<br /><br />Bottom line: There isn't much more to say about \\"Breaking Dawn\\" except that it's the final piece of escapist fantasy in Meyer's literary quadrangle and most certainly the one that requires the highest suspension of disbelief.  Though I have dared to read through the entire series to see what all the fuss is about, I don't think I will be picking up these books again unless I need an absolute departure from the mundanity of my life.s (and readers too), Rosalie becomes Public Enemy #1 after some shocking news gets broken, though she was never much of a likeable character to begin with.

B001DTPZNY|4.0|I went into the theater with a smile on my face and left with one, too. Sure there are a few moments in there that I could do without, but when you look at the big picture, KotCS is a damned good film. I've since seen it three more times, and it doesn't get boring for me. It's almost non stop action.<br /><br />I feel like this movie gets unfairly treated by an audience that not so much dislikes it, but outright refuses to accept its extra-terrestrial plot. For some reason, we can accept that a giant pillar of flame and smoke can melt a bunch of nazi's faces and then whisk them away to heaven or hell, or that a man can pull out another man's heart and have that man still live while being lowered into a pit of lava. However, we refuse to accept the possibility of alien life and its possible influence of early man and his view of \\"who your god is\\".<br /><br />Another complaint I hear alot is that the CGI is \\"bad\\". Watch the 2nd disc and you'll see that, save for the ending, a majority of the action was done on giant sets with real stunt men. They actually built that entire retracting stairwell near the end. It's pretty cool.<br /><br />Another gripe is \\"Ford looks too old.\\" Are you even watching the movie? Of course he's older! They go out of their way to tell you that. He's even referred to as \\"old man\\" more than once by Mutt. Lucas and Spielberg did the smart thing and made that his character. Indy's getting on in years, and things aren't what they used to be. It was a conscious decision to make Ford play Indy much more like Connery played his father in The Last Crusade.<br /><br />So is KotCS a \\"great\\" movie? No, its not my favorite of the series, and it wasn't even my favorite flick of the year, but god damned is it a good film. For me, it has held up to multiple viewing. I think KotCS will eventually be seen for what it is over the years: a lighthearted, action packed adventure with awesome visuals and sound, a great cast of characters, and yes a solid story.
B001GJOL22|5.0|I am a recent addition to the Rush army, I was 17 when I first heard \\"YYZ\\" in Guitar Hero 2. It didn't really get to me until I began to play the drums and started to really listen to a lot of prog from bands like Porcupine Tree, Dream Theater, and of course, RUSH. I must say that hese three guys really rock. Hard. Like, way harder than Green Day or Nickelback or whatever other garbage is out there. I have started my collection of Albums (Still Buying CD's to get that high-fi quality!) and am about half way there. When I saw that Snakes and Arrows was being released in Blu-ray, I immediately put it on my watch list and then rejoiced as the price went from $29.99 to $22.99 to $19.99.     Enough with my rant though, here's the real review:     VIDEO: After attending the Milwaukee show myself, I can say first hand that this is the way to watch a concert. You can't really go wrong with full 1080p high def video, and when you are getting multiple angles from on stage rather than a single angle from Section 311 row 18 seat 4, the experience is exponentially better. Watching it made me remember the great time I had at that show. Keeping in mind that this quality is standard with Blu-ray, the video work is average in my opinion; sometimes cutting too fast or ignoring solo events from one member to another, but overall is competent and captures the action nicely. B+     AUDIO: Unless you want to debate about the difference between Dolby TrueHD and DTS-HD, they are the best that audio fidelity can offer right now, dependant on whether your reciever can decode it. I plan on upgrading soon, but my reciever only decodes regular DTS, so the sound was not as good as it could be, but everything sounds like it should. At times I was wondering why they chose to mix certian sounds into certian channels (Neil's kit is admittedly hard to find a good mix for from multiple camera angles) but the sounds are great otherwise. A-     VALUE: You get the entire first leg of Snakes and Arrows, plus all of the songs that the guys played on the second leg. Together that represents a surprising variety of their catalogue and, of course, all of their new stuff. Additionally, you get out takes from the videos that they filmed for the tour (funny to watch once, but forgettable) and what seems to be an HD transfer from the R30 tour of Red Sector A. (Since R30 is already playing on the high definition cable channels we get here, it makes me wonder when the R30 Blu-ray will be out! :p) That's 3 hours+ of Rush and all on a single disk. For $20 you are definitely getting your monies worth! A+     Overall: As I said, every Rush fan capable of playing this disk should have it. If you close your eyes with a good 5.1 audio system, you can literally feel like you are at the concert and you can actually see the sweat beads on Geddy's arm at the same time. Need I say more? A-

If anything, the picture was even 'crisper' than the B&W version, and the coloring was realistic and natural. Bing & Fred are always a class act whether in color or Black & white, but it was great to see this perenial favorite as close as we'll ever get to how it would have looked if filmed this way. Hope Universal commissions more of Bing's [and Fred's] early films to be treated this way! Of course there are certain Bing Crosby films I'd love to see on DVD in any form, namely 'Sing You Sinners' [my personal favorite], and I think 'Holiday Inn' proves it's a worthwhile venture. On this occasion, Top Marks to Universal.
B001H5X7I4|4.0|... and mostly a riot! Tropic Thunder fails, only insofar as it falls short of all its ambitions, and in failing it is still one of the most original and audacious comedies of the past few years. There is so much to love about this movie: the writing, acting and execution of Robert Downey's character is fantastic. Tom Cruise is not only everything he needs to be for the satire to work so savagely, but his playing against type in the makeup he has to wear for the part...well, love the man or hate him, he is one hell of a movie actor!     There are no war movie cliches left standing and the pretensions of \\"method actors\\" are hilariously skewered in the courageous presentation of Downey's \\"white-guy-trying-to be-Black\\" Sargeant and Stiller's \\"I am Sam\\" satire.     I was on the fence about Ben Stiller, but this movie has made me a fan. The bravely non-PC in your face outrageousness of this film is refreshing, even when it doesn't quite work as humour. The only negatives I found were the mis- (under?-) use of Jack Black in a poorly written role and the anti-climacitc and formulaic ending. Stiller is trying to keep one too many satirical balls in the air, so the result does sometimes seem unfocused and the ending a bit tacked on and forced.    Jay Baruchel, Nick Nolte, Matthew McConaughey and Steve Coogan deserve special mention, particulalry Baruchel for being the \\"straight man\\" who highlights the over-the-top antics of the prima donna actors.    It's refreshing to see a comedy that has the guts to go after sacred cows. I hope Stiller keeps it up!
B001C08RHA|4.0|Great movie, enjoyed teh story which was backed up by great sound effects. When watching it at home with the home movie system, it almost took the pictures off the wall. Robert Downie Jr's best movie since Chaplin, just shows what a good script can do for your career. Gwyneth Paltrow played her role as the female butler exceptionally well.  Movie ends with the it set up for a sequal.    You won't be disappointed with this movie
B00005JPAO|4.0|This 2006 film tells the story of those dark days in 1997 when Princess Diana was tragically killed in a car crash and the world mourned the loss.  Queen Elizabeth, however, did not react immediately.  Because of the scandal surrounding the Princess's divorce from Prince Charles, royal protocol ruled, and there was a conspicuous silence from Buckingham Palace.<br /><br />In the role that won her the Academy Award, Helen Mirren's Queen Elizabeth seems absolutely real. Something magical happens and she actually \\"becomes\\" her royal highness herself.  It's not just that she looks like her; it's much more than that.  She has mastered the accent, the nuances, and the fleeting emotion in a self-controlled countenance.  She is also humbled and confused but this only comes through in fleeting moments of personal soul searching.  Otherwise, she embodies proper behavior as befits the tradition of the monarchy.<br /><br />Michael Sheen is cast in the role of Prime Minister Tony Blair and the early scenes depict his awkwardness in the presence of the Queen of England.  As the story progresses, however, he actually helps her to understand that the world has changed in the fifty years since she was crowned. This is all done very subtlety and I couldn't help be moved by the Queen's personal turmoil.<br /><br />There were strengths in the screenplay and but there were also weaknesses.  A lot of the story was told through newsreels that we have all seen over and over again.  Also, we know how it all played out.  And so I found myself a bit impatient at the slow pace.<br /><br />I do recommend this film as I think it shows a particular piece of history and some absolutely superb acting.  But it does drag on a bit so try not to be too sleepy when you see it.

B001EOQWFI|3.0|Let me first say that I was very pleased with the technical aspect of the movie.  It rivals Kung Fu Panda and Ratatouille on that level.  There were times I thought I was watching a real robot trekking through a real landscape.  I wasn't this surprised since Final Fantasy : The Spirits Within first came out a few years back.  Pixar definitely earns high marks for not skimping.  For someone looking to add a reference quality movie to their collection, this is a must.  Hands down.<br /><br />With respect to the story, let me first say that I was warned the first 30 or so minutes contained very little dialogue.  That's fine, Castaway proved that if you have a good story, you don't need to say a lot.  However, once the movie started it came off as preachy and a little holier-than-thou.  To sum up, we're pigs that made a mess of our own world to the point that we have to abandon it.  We become so caught up in convenience items that we turn into stupid, fat mooshy leeches caught up in our own narcissistic world.  The only one that can save us is an endearing little robot named Wall-E.  It sounds cynical, maybe it is, but I've seen this story before.  I've always thought of Pixar as the source for entertainment for young and old.  Someone that brought something new to the table.  They did provide, but it was, in my opinion, the worst movie they've done.  That said, it's still better than most other animated movies currently available.  Now some may disagree, and that's fine, I think it's a Coke/Pepsi/ Mac/PC mentality.  So rent it first and make up your own mind.

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|As a male, I probably shouldnt say this in public, but I'm a big fan of ABBA's music and you shouldn't feel embarrassed about seeing this film. It is such feel good fun, you will love it.<br /><br />In this brilliant, joyful film adaption of the hit stage show, 20-year-old Sophie Sheridan (Amanda Seyfried) lives with her mother Donna (Meryl Streep) on the small Greek island of Kalokairi where Donna runs a hotel called Villa Donna.<br />Sophie is about to be married and discovers that any one of 3 men could be her father. But is it Sam (Pierce Brosnan), Harry (Colin Firth) or Bill (Stellan Skarsgard)?<br />Sophie invites all 3 men to her wedding without telling Donna, who was the singer in a group called Donna and the Dynamos.<br /><br />Glorious music and songs, imaginatively staged numbers and a fine sense of fun are present in this film. I loved it!<br /><br />While Pierce Brosnan sounds awful, and sings like a lawnmower - and Colin Firth sounds rather nasal when singing \\"Last Summer\\" on guitar - in a funny way, the casting of actors who sing like us plebs works and adds to the fun and charm of the film. The wedding setting also works because you can imagine everyone at a wedding getting up and dancing or singing.<br />Meryl Streep has an excellent singing voice which will astonish sceptics, and I also thought the actress playing the daughter sang well!<br />The passionate renditions of The Winner Takes It All and Thank You For The Music are my highlights, and yet some uptempo songs are great too (Waterloo, Lay All Your Love On Me etc). I also think there are 1 or 2 touching moments in the film.<br />Yes the screenplay is very cheesy, and it may be camp as Christmas, but you will surely leave the theatre smiling.<br />Delightful.

B0011HOEY4|5.0|[[ASIN:B0011HOEY4 American Gangster (2-Disc Unrated Extended Edition)]]<br />GANGSTER MOVIES COME IN VIVID SPURTS, like machine - gun fire. In the early '30s, hard guys like James Cagney, Paul Muni and Edward G.Robinson paraded the sick dazzle of Prohibition - era thugs. Forty years later the Corleones ruled, but on the margins were the subgenera of African Americans gangster films: SUPERFLY, BLACK CAESAR and their bloody kin. Beneath the violent fantasies of these films was a historical fact: African American mobsters were seizing power from the Italians, who had run the underworld. AMERICAN GANGSTER, is the real - life microcosm of that story. Frank Lucas (DENZEL WASHINGTON) was a Harlem drug lord who, the Vietnam era, revolutionized the Heroin trade by importing the nasty white stuff directly from Southeast Asia, often in the caskets of U.S.soldiers. As Lucas amassed a $50 million fortune, investigator Richie Roberts (RUSSELL CROWE) pusued him. Their story was told in a magazine article that is the source for this film. Director RIDLEY SCOTT and scriptwriter, STEVEN ZAILLIAN (who last collaborated on HANNIBAL) aren't your standard shoot-em-up types, so they'll be painting Lucas as a prototype of white-collar criminals and, even more crucially, highlighting<br />the element of race in the heroin business. The Mafia, considered African Americans as its customers, not the rivals. Lucas and the more notorious NICKY BARNES(played by CUBA GOODING Jr.) changed all that. The movie surely has another motive. The three actors and Zaillian, are all Academy Award winners, as is producer, BRIAN GRAZER( for A BEAUTIFUL MIND ), and Scott helmed GLADIATOR to a BEST PICTURE statuette.

B000J233SK|5.0|I bought this CD for the song \\"Dante's Prayer\\" but fell in love with the the entire CD and all the music of Loreena McKennitt. Dante's Prayer is the most beautiful song I have ever heard. I am not exaggerating at all. Loreens's music is like food to the soul. I bought other CD's by Loreena McKennitt and they are all great and well worth buying. \\"The Book Of Secrets\\" is still my very favorite. Great for relaxing. Let Loreena take you back to a time when chivalry and romance was at it's peak. Enjoy poetry by Tennyson and other great poets and feel them like never before with the heavenly voice of Loreena McKennitt.

0316017922|5.0|The key ingredient to success in life is an individual's willingness to work hard and make the most of the opportunities they are given.  This is the basic premise of Outliners.  The information in this book is not new, but Gladwell presents his ideas in such an interesting way.  This makes Outliners a good read.  Intelligence is not just an individual's score on an IQ test. Intelligent people are creative people who do well on convergence tests.  A convergence test requires a person to use their imagination to come up with as many answers to a question. Certain people are born at the right time to take advantage of opportunities.  Gladwell provides the example of Bill Gates who came of age in mid seventies to become the most successful person in the computing world.  According to Gladwell, it takes 10,000 hours of practice to become an expert at something.  This is true in the case of Bill Gates who started programming when he was 13.  Gladwell makes the assumption that Asian people are good at math.  I am asian, and I am horrible at math. Gladwell also addresses the idea of concerted cultivation.  This is the belief that a student succeeds in school if they are surrounded with educational opportunities outside of school.  Another interesting idea in this book is that a person's work ethic and behavior are passed down from their family and rooted in their culture.  Gladwell presents Chinese people as persistent people who work hard.  I won't go into specific details, but the chapter on cultural legacy is fascinating.  I really enjoyed reading Outliners, even though I might not agree with everything Gladwell says.
B00005JLKN|3.0|Red Dragon starring Anthony Hopkins is a extremely suspenseful thriller. The ending is a bit disappointing and I notice other reviewers have stated that complaint as well. Edward Norton and Ralph Feines bring great energy to this film. Much better than expected, gotta see it!
074322454X|5.0|Stephen Ambrose's Band of Brothers has been much praised and I want to add my praise to that chorus.  It is the story of Easy Company, 2nd Battalion of the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, from their training at Camp Toccoa, Georgia to the capture of Hitler's Eagle's Nest in Bavaria.      They were at the tip-of-the-spear in numerous key engagements of the European Theater of Operations - Normandy, Operation Market Garden, the Battle of the Bulge, and beyond.    By the end of the war, Easy Company had spent well over 120 days on the very front lines in combat conditions.  The size of the company at full-strength was 140 men.  Of the men who fought in the unit, 48 were killed in action, and over 100 wounded, some wounded multiple times.      Several themes run through the story.  One of them is the tight camaradery of soldiers fighting side-by-side: \\"Comrades are closer than friends, closer than brothers\\" (p. 19).  Another is the vital role of leadership in battle.  Lt. Harry Welsh's opinion was: \\"officers go first\\" (p.  36).  That was Capt. Dick Winters style as well-the story revolves a great deal around him-and it was recognized by all: \\"'Follow me' was his code. He personally killed more Germans and took more risks than anyone else.\\" (p. 155).    One should not assume that Ambrose is denigrating any other unit that saw action in the key battles Easy Company participated in.  Rather, understand that he is providing a view into the experiences and actions of combat for the American fighting men of the Second World War through the eyes of a small-unit that fought in numerous key engagements of the war and proved their mettle in battle through their leadership, comradeship, lives, and blood.    Band of Brothers renewed and deepened my appreciation and thanksgiving for the men and women who fought to end the evil that was the Nazi Empire.  There is a reason that the Nazi Swastika does not fly over the capitols of Europe today and it is in large part due to the willingness of warriors like the men of Easy Company.  Citizens who loved peace and yet responded to the call to arms.  They were willing to pick up a rifle and learn to stop the enemy and drive him back.  And in battle, when home was distant and ideals driven from the mind, they always found a reason to stand, fight, and sacrifice if for nothing else but the brother standing next to them.    I commend to you, Band of Brothers, it is well-written, flows easily, and is a wonderful testament to the American fighting men of the Second World War.

B0014DZ2VO|1.0|Having been a fan of the Bond series since its inception, I have to rate this one as one of the worse ones ever.  It felt like a remake of License to Kill with Timothy Dalton.  It seems as if Craig was suffering from the sophmore jinx that all his predecessors suffered from, save Sean Connery.  The plot is mindless and when one of your highlights is Dame Judy Dench applying facecream, you know they were stretching for content.    The Bourne films are far and away superior, despite the fact that they probably don't spend as nearly as much on special effects.  It is so obvious that the producers of the Bond series are trying to copy Bourne it is ridiculous.  \\"How much time do I have?\\"  Give us a break.  I'm sure Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass are beside themselves.  It is like watching a heavyweight fight in the late rounds and you just know the loser is on the verge of getting knocked out.  Mark my word, if they decide to do another Bourne film, they will make sure that it exceeds the quality of this latest Bond installment once again.    I read somewhere that the highlight of going to see this movie was the preview for the next installment of Star Trek.  I couldn't agree with them moore.

B0010DRYPA|4.0|If you wish to learn more about the operations of the four major studios from the 1920s through the 1950s, I suggest you buy Thomas Schatz's excellent book, \\"The Genius of the System.\\"  Schatz's detailed research of the making of \\"Grand Hotel\\" clearly shows why MGM was considered Hollywood's top studio.  Prior to going into production in January 1932, there were dozens of story conferences with producer Irving Thalberg, director Edmund Goulding, and several top MGM personnel. Complicated rewrites were needed before production could begin. Problems with the script remained even after dozens of rewrites. In mid January production began.  There were no problems on the set due to such a professional cast under the supervision of Edmund Goulding, MGM's top director. In early March upon completion of the film, there were several previews held in the suburbs of Los Angeles. Much to the surprise of the studio and its cast, the film was not well received. Back to the rewrites, reshooting and editing. A month later, the film premiered and this time the audiences' reception was quite different. MGM proudly saw this film nominated for Best Picture--which it won months later.
B000P0J0AQ|1.0|I just purchased the newly-in-a- keepcase (not a snapper)edition which has  ©2008 on the back cover fine print (Amazon says 2007)  I had held out because I had heard rave reviews of the remaster for the box set back in 2003-which you could only buy in the set at the time . I already had the 1999 disc-so I could wait  So, 5 years later a new package, with new package design work, current year copyright,-and WHV sitting on a nice RM for  a few years I thought \\"Aha! Now  is the time to get it it!\\"=thinking that after all the years they would ditch the 1999 transfer.  I watched the movie and thought, hmmmmmmmm nothing here that outstanding-almost looks like the old disc.  So I put my disc into my iMac, opened it on the desktop-nothing!  I use this trick to determine when a discs is remastered.  They can press the disc for 5 years but the transfer date is the constant on file creation.    WTF? I open to a blank page! no TS_AUDIO, no TS_VIDEO  no .VOB files nothing-these would show dates of creation on them, so one can tell the last time a disc was remastered.  My long used trick didnt work.  Then I get the idea to do a 'right click' to 'get info' from the menu    Lets party like it was 1999!  August 2-to be exact. Seems like they were hiding something?  an 8 year old transfer  in a 2008 box......\\"File creation date-Aug 2, 1999\\" hmmmmmm is it just me?  I also notice on the inner ring, a different catalog number-and MADE IN CANADA printed on the plastic)  Curiously, nowhere on the label is a visible  date or place of manufacture-which I thought to be law.  And the box has the ©2008 date only    Misspackaging? They should destroy back stock, or stop printinng them-not reship it at this late date as if 'new'  I dont think the marketseller will refund me-\\"Whaaaa! I got the 1999 pressing I want my money back\\"-he couldnt know    This has me pi**ed because they have been sitting on a remaster for several years-and it should have been made available as a single disc by now- I didnt want the whole box-back then, or now  After all, it would not be two far out of reason to expect it with  new box/design change, that they would use the new transfer,no?  With an economic meltdown happening right before our eyes-$175 Trillion in bailouts (total so far), consumer spending dropping like a stone,- and the deficits-we sit in a trance and allow this    I would not offend the still very large S-DVD market which is still 90% of your revenue-BR can never quite keep a continual average of 10% in monthly sales (source: videoscan/endgadget-industry gerbils- for past 6 months ZD Net-a popular widely read IT i-zine' -say 5% 0f the market)-and now you can bet that will drop with the economy.   a 10% sales drop in DVD sales could be absorbed-a 10% in BR would finish it off   Sales of players are slow now and will be dead in Jan-you can see the writing on the wall-\\"BUY ANY 1 BR title AND GET 3 FREE!! Not exactly confidence building- which i s why Ive held off- and who knows how long I will  have my job?  And YOU?  So Warner-dont pull tricks like you did to 'force' us from LD to DVD-namely-by either giving the BR the special features ONLY, and for SDVD, sloppy pressing and packaging-or not even manufacturing the disc at all.   BOTH SONY and WHV were guilty of this when DVD started. Some will chime in \\"Nobodies forcing you to go to BR...\\"  Well, if I like watching moves or getting SEs-and they no longer press them on DVD-I AM forced-into BR-not a very good marketing idea when we may soon see 25% unemployment*-and people will only buy NECESSITIES (nobody in finance  the fairy tale calculation models that BLS use seriuosly-which curiuosly make things look 'rosier' than they really are-they ONLY count you as UE if you are COLLECTING  UC..the rest of you can get lost for all they care) They say 6.5%! ha!

B001GQACGE|2.0|I really enjoy Beyonce's music.  I own Dangerously in Love and B-Day.  When she dropped \\"Single Ladies\\" I was hype to purchase her third album.  Unfortunately, this third work is very disappointing.  I bought the deluxe edition.  Most of the songs are depressing and melancholy.  They lack the energy that I expect from Beyonce.  I agree with other reviewers - \\"Radio\\" sounds like a Rhianna song and \\"Halo\\" sounds like a Leona Lewis joint. \\"Video Phone\\" is just nasty.  Out of the whole album, I'd say I like five songs - \\"If I Were A Boy\\", \\"Disappear\\", \\"Diva\\" (although it sounds like a take of Lil' Wayne's \\"Milli\\"), \\"Sweet Dreams\\" and \\"Single Ladies\\". I wanted this to be a great album, but I can't honestly say that it is.  It's just \\"OK\\".

0060537639|5.0|This review adds comments to Menzies' landmark book on how the mediaeval Chinese empire developed ocean-going vessels, geopositioning and mapping systems before the Europeans. The Ming Dynasty developed it at a huge cost overextending itself and ultimately abandoned this effort before triumphantly sheparding the world. Fortunately this legacy was not forgotten in southern China and was secretly perpetuated through Chinese maritime legend and lore.    Recent Sino and Western historians have written a now huge library on why it was Southern China's Guangdong and Fujian's poor and isolated provinces which continued to be the locus of outward-looking vision of the world. This discussion will concentrate on Menzies' American thesis and collaborate modern Chinese topics. The Chinese diaspora originated in Toisan (100 miles west of Canton (Guangzhou) in mid- to late-1800s with the lure of \\"easy-money\\" at the start of California's Gold Rush. Toisan's (Toishan) famine, an agriculturally poor, over-populated mountainous region, started a mass diaspora to SE Asia and the Americas, bound together with the its unique Cantonese-like dialect.    The hc book has a 14-pg index, 100-pg appendices including a 25-pg bibliography, 35 maps & drawings and 32-pg of color pixs. Menzies' unique research adventure curiously starts with being raised in China as a child by a Chinese \\"amah,\\" or old grandmother caregiver p10.    The ships were built from the essential teak and ironwood, a tropical hardwood, which has natural oils that resist weakening when submersed in seawater. The China Empire's Guangdong and Annan regions (now North Vietnam) had the virgin tropical rain forests p63 essential for building a flotilla of 400+ft ships.    \\"Junk\\" or \\"Wangkang\\" boat design and building, so labeled derisively by the UK and Europe, was not low-tech. It had rudders, keel designs and sails with battens needed to efficiently captured wind power. The major deficiency of being able to sail into the wind p64, unlike the deep keels and narrower beams of modern yacht design, was made up for by making huge ships with shallow (<10ft) draft so they could be self-sufficient for year-long voyages and global sailing techniques by set-sail \\"with\\" the prevailing winds and ocean currents (Walker circulation, UCAR). This seasonal geophysical and climatological knowledge was mapped in secret. Thus massive floating cities with appropriate talents for maintenance and exploitation, including shipwrights and masons, cooks and concubines, metallurgy and mining technologists, and huge holds for trading and tribute.    In 2003 the first American-built Chinese junk was launched. The US National Park Service had commissioned John Muir, a young curator of San Francisco's Maritime Museum to design and build a historically authentic junk at China Camp State Park near San Rafael, CA in Marin County. He participated in a cultural exchange program with Southern China resources to authenticate building techniques. It is the single-masted 43-ft junk \\"Grace Quan,\\" a replica of a 1906 shrimp fishing sailboat where many used to ply SF Bay estuaries during the 1860-1910. The junk was christened (YouTube) in memory of the mother of 80+ year-old Frank Quan, the last surviving Chinese SF Bay shrimp fisherman. Muir's collegiate Masters thesis was on archaeology of CN fishing craft.    Then in 2005-8, a Taiwanese group, the Chinese Maritime Development Society [....], underwrote building an authentic 54-ft, 3-masted ocean-going Chinese Junk \\"Princess TaiPing.\\" It was designed and built after an exhaustive 3-year program of shipbuilding research, a collaboration with PRChina, HK, and deciphering Fujian history and shipwright records of the Ming Dynasty (1368-1644). So far with a crew of eight, it has crossed the Pacific in 69 days, first landing in Eureka, Humboldt Cty near the CA-Oregon boarder before sailing south into SF Bay, Youtube (ZfpdWlcwcm4).    The crew was, understandably, cold, waterlogged, hungry for fresh produce and exhausted from surviving endless storms during the first leg of this historic voyage. The return leg to Greater China from San Diego is starting upon this writing (Dec 08). It will use a southern route via Hawaii to take advantage of the equatorial winds and currents of Winter. If successfully completed in 2009, this will be the first trans-Pacific crossing in a sailing junk in modern times.    \\"NingPo (previously Kin Tai Foong)\\" is the oldest (1753, Fuzhou, Fujian) known CN junk in California, sunk off the Catalina Islands [...]. This 138ft, 3-masted, 3ft draft junk was last used in 1938.    \\"Tek Sing (True Star)\\" sunk off the Sumatra, Java coast in SE Asia in 1822 with a full load of trade cargo and 1600 people, mainly field laborers bound for Java. The tragedy is known as the \\"Chinese Titanic.\\" It was a 150ft, 3-masted, 20ft beam junk. The wreck was found on May 12, 1999 according to Nigel Pickford's book [...]. It was built in 1817 at Amoy (Xiamen) in Fujian province.       Another curious theory of Menzies' thesis is that Asiatic chickens (south CN) were present in the Americas before Columbus landed. There is an extended discussion p123 including Rhode Island where he claims that Chinese junks had gifted these chickens to American natives before the Portuguese and Spanish claimed the Americas.    In Traditional Chinese Medicine, a bred of Asiatic chicken has black skin, meat, bones and special medicinal qualities. This Cornish hen-sized melanotic chickens are commercially raised in BC, Canada and distributed fresh and frozen throughout the States at large Asian markets and Chinatowns. The modern breed, a black Silkie, is popular as a pet breed in the UK.    Several TCM-oriented cookbooks include its preparation and herbs. There are many Taipei, Taiwan health food restaurants that serve it. It is entirely plausible that these chickens were raised on mediaeval junks to provide food that had extraordinary nutrition for long arduous voyages.     All-in-all, Menzies book is a fascinating read, easy to comprehend in that many of his theories are determined by careful examining disparate facts and using inductive logic. As in his discussion on how Chinese navigators were the first to discover how to accurately measure longitude in Appendix 4, p177-87 by year 1421.
B0000214F0|4.0|All I know is that this movie mesmarized me as an 18 year old boy in 1982 just coming to terms with being gay.(It explores the homosexual theme a lot)I had never seen a real \\"movie\\" that was almost like a porno film before.I thought it was as funny as it was decadant and violent.

B000069HKH|2.0|Poor Bruce Springsteen, getting old and moving sideways, wrapped-up in leftist political struggle, confused about life...sad, oh so very sad.    His 'glory days' behind him, he pushed this one out.  The music sounds forced, stale;  like a poem without a theme or a rhyme; like a sunset on a clear night.  Nothing fresh here, only confused notes and words.  This one misses the boat (in my opinion, and after all, these reviews are only opinions).      If you can relate to this CD, good for you.  If you can connect to the music, good for you.  But I know what's good and this isn't good at all.    Bruce can do better; he's done oh so much way better!      If you want real Springsteen; real hard, raw, innocent, righteous stuff, you gotta try the 'Tracks' 4-disc compilation.  Now that's what music is!    Thanks for reading this.
B00003CXPJ|1.0|Don't get me wrong, I normally love Ben Stiller and Owen Wilson, but I found this movie to be absolutely DIRE. The humor was so stupid that it went way beyond the realms of funny stupid humor and just in to plain stupid and boring. Ben Stillers acting was appalling, he insisted on using the type of voice a 14 year old boy uses when he's trying to pretend that he's stupid (the duuuuuuuuuh voice) and it gets extremely grating after about 10 minutes and just not funny. His character is so badly portrayed that you have no sympathy for him and just want to turn the movie off so that you don't have to watch this moron anymore, instead of wanting to stay to watch the movie so you could see what happened next to the 'sweet endearing moron' as I guess it was supposed to be    I tried to watch this all the way through, I had to turn it off twice for a few hours to steel myself for more as you might to if you have to visit the dentist for multiple fillings. But despite my mental health breaks, I couldn't bring myself to finish it    Truely awful
B000XCZGV8|4.0|3 1/2 STARS - I remember the news reports when I was a kid growing up in Sacramento and remember how uptight and worried my parents and others were.  When I watched this movie I was so into the story but the movie seemed to be a bit boring and slow.  At least they did not HOLLYWOOD it up too much and add unreal blow um up action scenes.  True real life really is boring so this movie was about right on.  I watched it and dug it but I can't see watching it again...maybe in a couple years i'll see it again.<br /><br />I say watch it and see what you think.  It is good enough to watch at least once.
0307269752|3.0|I must agree with a majority of the reviews here and admit that this is a remarkable novel with a lot of drive and vigor, few paragraphs of filler, and a wild read. Larsson is an intelligent writer, and the continuous feel of his story and characters demonstrates a heightened skill level and the translation seems to be transparent, but as I cannot read the novel in its native tongue, I guess I'll never know. It is with a heavy heart that I downgrade my opinion from four stars to three: the book's shortcomings are tough to ignore. I wish there were a three and a half.<br /><br />First, I'll go ahead and toss in my \\"ignorant American\\" commentary and say that the proper nouns in their original Swedish were distracting at times. The author assumed that I knew that this name was feminine or this place was affluent, whereas I had to draw those conclusions in context. My own shortcomings, you shout? Possibly, but I would have thought a more skilled translator to be able to fix those references. Most notably: \\"gaol\\" is a prison referenced several times throughout the book, though I have no idea what it meant. At first the term seemed to be interchangeable with \\"jail\\" but then I got the impression that it was simply a forced boarding house, or \\"minimum security\\" prison, but as it was never explained, I still have no idea.<br /><br />Second, I will admit that I am a stickler on plot holes and Larsson has very, very few. I did note, however, that Blomkvist and Salander seem to find each other in a very forced way: Frode needs to find a biblical researcher and thinks of the woman who performed a background check? It seemed a little contrived. I also thought Bjurman might make another appearance after his paralyzing thought, \\"I have to get that video\\", but he did not rear his ugly face (and tattooed torso!). It lead me to believe that Larsson left that door open but ran out of time to include him back into the story.<br /><br />Most severe, however, is clearly the denouement. After the climax, things started to drop out of sight quickly. Personally, I didn't understand why Salander didn't want to involve the police, but I guess that's her call. I thought the plot against Wennerstr&ouml;m was far more elaborate than it needed to be, and focused a lot on the procedural process of publishing, which I gather is what Larsson really enjoys. The whole thing seemed too long, except for the final few paragraphs, which gloss over the relationship between the two main characters and rather obviously prepare Salander for the sequel.<br /><br />Where Larsson really lost the fourth star, however, was putting no effort into making Blomkvist a full character. Mikael appeared to be a narrator at times, observing and deducing, but rarely acting. He drudged up a little anger at Frode after the climax, but even that dissolves after a pleasant paycheck. Lisbeth is definitely the highlight of the book and makes it worth reading, but she can't save the sinking ship after it has sprung a leak.<br /><br />Overall, I recommend reading it and think you'll like it, too. But I can point you to countless titles I think you'd enjoy better.tarted to drop out of sight quickly.

079073639X|3.0|With three great actors in it, you would think a movie couldn't bomb?!<br />I suppose it has to do with the novel not being worth much to start?<br />When the final bomb goes off, we are grateful<br />instead of sorry? Science fiction as a B horror movie<br />is just not a very good idea.<br />And when it is on a high budget everybody regrets it?<br />Some of Micheal Crichton's other novels as movies turned much better.
B00005BGV2|1.0|Tool has too many problems preventing them from ever reaching greatness.      The most noticeable problem is their lack of talent to actually write a decent vocal melody.  Instead, the lead singer sounds like someone who just blurts out whatever kind of vocals he thinks is appropriate, no matter how absurd is sounds, which mostly means he ends up either sounding obnoxious for wasting my time, or comes across sounding JUST as generic as thousands of other singers who are attempting the same thing as far as commercial alternative rock music goes.  Choose either one.  The sound of his voice alone is enough to send me screaming in total fear.    Then you have the guitar riffs, that are not only uninspiring and uncreative, but supposedly millions of people hear something interesting about them (which is completely mind-boggling to me).  Wanna hear interesting guitar riffs?  Check out Black Sabbath, Metallica, Iron Maiden, and Led Zeppelin.  The kind of guitar riffs on this Tool album are about as generic as they come.  Very average.  The guitar solos aren't any good either.      The lyrics are sometimes tolerable, but this band is certainly no Bob Dylan as far as lyrics go, but I guess they *are* the highlight of the album.  Not that THAT is saying very much, mind you.  Lyrics about spiritual journeys, escaping reality, or however you want to interpret them.  Sometimes they're alright, but most of the time the lack of any kind of interesting vocal melody makes taking the time to pay attention to the lyrics on Lateralus a complete chore.      This is just forgettable rock music.  Whether people think Tool are an intelligent band, or saving the rock scene, or however you want to think of them.  The bottom line to me is that they are below average, and to me personally, incredibly uninteresting.
B000MV9026|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies. My 6 year old and I watched it probably 50 times, no exaggeration.  The look of this movie is really impressive. It doesn't look like a cartoon, it looks real.  The penguins look real. It actually looks like real penguins talking, singing, and dancing, and of course walking around and swimming, etc. Penguins are beautiful animals.  A lot of things in the movie are factual. The way they care for the egg, and how the males huddle in the cold dark antartic with the egg on their feet, and take turns on the outside of the huddle, etc.<br />Most of the movie takes place in Antartica, and just a bit where Mumble finds himself in a zoo.<br />I thought the movie also had some really good \\"messages\\",  and not just the environmental one.
B00133KFGW|4.0|This is a very poignant and touchy feely movie that aims to appeal to that small part of you that wants to believe there are magical elements at work in our lives.  Freddie Highmore does a decent job, though I loved him more in Finding Neverland.  Terrence Howard seems to be type-cast and Keri Russell is still trying to escape her Felicity image. And I'm quickly becoming a Jonathan Rhys Meyer fan.  For me the point of the film is to reflect the power of music and how it tends to connect people more than anything else in life.  Frankly it punched all my sappy buttons and I just loved it.
0375507256|3.0|I have a penchant for buying books with things like 'map' or 'atlas' in the title and this was on the recommended reads shelf at a bookstore I was in so I just bought it on the spot.    I really really wanted to love this book.  I tried quite hard. As the stories built forward to the center of the book I got more and more excited wondering how this was all going to be brought together. When I finished the center section I felt a little \\"....?\\" I guess I was expecting the stories to be more connected, as if some giant mystery was going to be solved.  For a while I thought the central story, since it was set in Hawaii was going to tie back to the original story set in the Pacific Ocean and have time be circular.  Alas no.    David Mitchell is excellent at writing in very different styles and all the stories were interesting in their own right.  I simply suggest that you approach this book more as a compilation of short stories and less as a single novel.
B00020HEG6|5.0|This movie was the best, the book is the best and the soundtrack of the movie is the best!  I guess it's the power of 3 or something. I've grown up enjoying John Williams music, and now I really enjoy Harry Potter so to have Williams as the composer of some of the movies is one of the best possible combinations of awesomeness I've ever found!

B000AO4NJA|5.0|ive been listening to this album since i was a little girl and sam cooke still gives me the chills when i hear him sing. i have no doubt that he is one of the greatest singers of all time. all of his songs were obviously not classics, but no one can touch him on \\"bring it on home to me\\". that is his masterpiece as far as im concerned.
B001GAPC1K|5.0|My husband rented Iron Man and watched it without me since I'm not a big movie person. After watching the film he said,\\"You have to watch this. It's great!' I thought, \\"Yeah, right\\" and that it would be another boring comic book movie. Well, I was wrong!<br />Iron Man IS great. R.D. Jr. is terrific in the lead.<br />The movie grabbed me from the first scene.<br />This flick has action, romance and humor.
031606792X|1.0|Like everyone has saud before, this book should not exhist. The first three are so brilliant in writing style, plot twists, and charactor development. The fourth book is a poor attempt to make a \\"happily ever after\\" ending. Unlike twilight, new moon, and elclipse (all excellent about tying up loose ends) this book has too many unaswered questions...  1. What do you mean they aren't really werewolves?!!! This pointless twist is just flat out frustrating and uneccessary nd followed up by a lame reason explainting why \\"real\\" werewolves are so rare.   2. Since when did twilight become an epid romance between Bella and Renesmee? Edward totally took back seat and frankly i feel there love was cheapend by the sexual dynamic of the story. What was captivating about there relationship was that Bella and Edward were in love not lust...one scene was sweet and climactic....half a dozen before the middle of the book is just is pushing it way far beyonf the then stnding \\"pg\\" rating  3. What was the J. Jenks angle. Those stressful scenes seemed to be going somewhere ....and then it didn't. The misterious clues left by Alice and the the tension and pain cause by having to let Renesmee go turn out to be a big huge false alarm...haha just kidding of course they live happily ever after.  4. Other than the terribly anticlimactic battle scene..where the day was saved by Alice who on her way around world sent vampires to Forks and looked for every vampires future so that she could find those that she couldnt see the future of (by the way what did Jasper do?...watch? because Alice never even gives him credit for being present)  5. Who is this vampire Jobe who is apparently is breeding a super race? Whats the point...why bring this up? Why are only the male sired by him venimous? What happend to him? Did he sire three kids and then give up or meet his end?  ..........just a few of many many many holes in an already unstable plot
1881273156|3.0|The point of this book, that different people need to be showed love in different ways, is a solid one.  I've been telling my husband that for years!  I certainly wasn't telling him as clearly as Chapman describes in this book, though.    I appreciated being able to clarify my thoughts about expressing love by reading this book.  Chapman's ideas weren't revolutionary to me, but were reassuring nonetheless.      Aspects of this book didn't work for me.  The individual stories were a bit simplistic, full of couples whose marriages seemed totally on the rocks until they tried this easy love language method that fixed everything in their lives.  The book itself, with its pages of pink puffy clouds and flower illustrations, looked a bit like a cheesy greeting card, and as a non-Christian I skimmed over the Bible verses.    So there were some parts of this book that were better left ignored, but the basic idea resonated with me, and gave me a handful of concrete ideas to apply to my own relationships with my husband as well as with my children.
B000TGCR3S|4.0|You must be a big fan of cartoon with high details if come up to love this one.      The plot is extremely empty and even childish, about 2 adolescent boys, orphans I think, who sleep in the street and make a living from theft.  Yet they think they are protectors of the city and the elder one is particularly good in martial art, and both boys can jump up high buildings with bare foot.  It's like listening to the story of a kid that makes you laugh.    Yet the artwork is astounding to the effect that I just forget about the characters or what their are doing and focus to appreciate the surrounding artwork, like you enterd an art gallery, you would not mind whether the doorkeeper is decent in look but care about the paintings only. The artwork just make that from Disney or Pixar look pale and poor in details.      One drawback is that all characters are drawn roughly, including the two boys, like blackspots on a perflect painting.      Bravo for who brought us the fantastic artwork!
031606792X|5.0|Perfect ending to the series.  After the first book, I was a bit unwilling to continue reading once a read in reviews that Edward would leave and Jacob would emerge... but when I learned the movie was coming out, I decided to give it a try.  2000+ pages later, I can't say that I am disappointed.  I lived every moment of suspense, of happiness, of despair, of pride.... Once in a while I even caught myself looking ant the book, looking at the page, and telling myself that these were words on a page, a story... that lasted about 20 seconds and I was back again. I only hope for some kind of spin off story to the series..
0688014291|2.0|Kenneth Blanchard and Spencer Johnson birthed a monster writing style when they published THE ONE MINUTE MANAGER, \\"The Runaway #1 National Bestseller!\\" -- and that style is surrounding a hideously boring topic with clichés, adverbs, adjectives, redundancies, dull characters, and exclamation points. The book is then called a nonfiction fable. Hunh?    When this book came out in 1981 it used a new, perhaps fresh, approach to teaching management skills, but since then it has been copied and copied and copied ... when it should be put in a cage. It's time to stop dumbing down and start smartening up books for managers. Enough already!     Note: You'll only need 1 minute to get what's useful out of this book.

B001GQACGO|5.0|I've been listening to this CD since the leak, I actually just bought it the other day.  I've really liked the CD, I've listened to other Beyonce CDs but I was never moved enough to go out and buy it.  I'm loving the \\"Sasha Fierce\\" CD.  Beyonce is showing that she has the musical talent to expand beyond uptempo club songs.  She's setting herself apart from most other female artists and showing that she is right there with the strongly talented female vocalists like Alicia Keys.  Any female artists can make a song like \\"Put a Ring On It\\", but lets be real...in a song like that the producer does more work than the vocalist.  But in a song like Heart Broken Girl or Satellites, she is showcasing how gifted her voice really is and singing over very soft beats, that emphasize her voice more than rhythm of the song.  But lets face it, Beyonce hasn't really magnified this side of her resume in the past and that may be the problem she is getting a mixed ovation.  But any hip-hop/r&b fan knows that whenever an artists makes change, they also create controversy....Jay-z on Kingdom come, it was a good CD with solid sophisticated lyrics and soft beats...but it wasn't Jay-z so it got bad reviews.  Nas on I Am...it was different from Ilmmatic and It Was Written so he faced criticism, but more recently Usher...he grew up on his new CD and left a lot of the pop in the past and was criticized for his change.  If you're a fan of MUSIC, buy this Beyonce CD.  If you're looking for something uptempo, dance, or club songs...this probably isn't as well suited for you when comparing it to other Beyonce CDs.
B001H5X7JS|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie, it is packed full of laughs. If you like Ben Stiller and Jack Black, that is reason enough to run out and buy this dvd. I recommend buying the special 2 disc, it is packed full of extras.

1400063515|5.0|Start with Fooled by Randomness (Taleb's first book), The Logic of Life - similar idea (less business oriented not as technical) and Against the The Gods.  Then take on The Black Swan.  An amazing book (Thank you Taleb for allowing us to leverage for $25 all the hours and brain energy you put into making these concepts cohesive - high ROI).  This publication offers facinating insight into how much of what we don't know about what we don't know can/may/will affect us and helps hedge against the unknown - all the while respecting that there will always be an element of the unknown that simply can not be predicted.  And the impact of the highly improbable lurks.  Irreverant and written with humor it's surprisingly readable for its heady content.  You will be changed.      The only thing I didn't care for was the title of the book.  I get its application, but I think there could have been a more applicable name - but who the hell am I to say?    After you're done with The Black Swan, if you're musically inclined, go grab This is Your Brain on Music - these authors must meet.  Different industries - interesting applications to ideas from both.    Just keep reading! Literacy = Knowledge = Empowerment = Peace
B000002J5K|5.0|\\"Blues Brothers\\" features two of the 70's best comedians, in the midst of a dancing frenzy, backed by the best (and most expensive) session musicians, in a celebration of rhythm and blues.  The brothers don't just sing about a riot in cell block number 9, they LIVE IT!  The talking introductions to songs, jokes, and repartee frenzy, again and again, into a crescendo of fun.  Musically, the horn section gives the party a New Year's tone, the percussion section drives the tempo hard, like a drunk dancer, until the back-up singers lay the frosting on this cake.  Jake and Elliot!  Lou Marini!  Big fun!

0312370849|4.0|I've always been interested in the Holocaust and thought I'd learned a lot about the different horrors that the victims suffered.  But I had no idea that this happened in France and it was French police who arrested their own citizens!  The author did a beautiful job of weaving the stories of a little girl, told in third person and an adult woman, told in first person from chapter to chapter.  I was able to read this book rather quickly and appreciate the book group questions at the end.  My only criticism was that the end of the book felt rushed, like the author was done with what she wanted to say and needed a quick way to wrap things up.  The author was careful to make sure she was accurate with the historical aspects of the book, a quick check on google and I realized that she had done her research.  I look forward to reading more books by this author.  All in all, I would definitely recommend this book to everyone as none of us should ever forget.

B000FPWXUA|5.0|Kiss, who desperately needs to put out a new disc,<br /> really was in top form<br />when they made this album.  This was to be their last great disc until \\"creatures of the night.\\" although the albums between had alot of<br />great songs even if they had lost track of their true direction it seemed.  Back in 1977 this album was well greeted by fans and foes alike<br />and  it wasn't apparent that the band was in trouble for various reasons.<br />Love gun had many great songs that are very melodic and to this day<br />are quite enjoyable.  Kiss continues to draw new fans into it's orbit based on great discs like this one but unless they put out a new cd soon they will be seen as a dead band regardless if they tour or not. They just have to look back to this period and see that they can put out decent songs that the fans can enjoy and that are  melodic and alot of fun.<br />Love gun, is a good introduction to the wonderful hard rock of kiss; who if they wake up will finally get some new songs to us; because we the fans are still out here.  rock and roll over!
B001EYGOEM|5.0|Taylor Swift is amazing.  Who knew that there were still musical artists that could sing and WRITE their own music?  This CD is a must buy for anyone that likes country/pop music!
B001GQACGO|5.0|This is a fantastic album.  Or actually I should say albums since this is a two-disc set and each disk is pretty much a separate album.  The first is titled I Am and is full of nice, wonderful, vulnerable love songs/ballads.  The second CD is titled Sasha Fierce, and is full of the more upbeat and fun songs.      The ballads on the first disc are all really wonderful to listen to.  If I Were A Boy is catchy and really fun to sing along actually.  Halo is great.  Disappear has a sweet, nice melody.  Broken-Hearted Girl is another fun catchy song to sing.  Ave Maria is wonderfully sung.  Smash Into You is pretty touching and sweet.  Satellites is also wonderfully sung.  That's Why You're Beautiful is alright; it's my least fave of the ballads.    The fun songs on the second disc are great too.  I love Single Ladies.  Radio is great fun.  Diva is pretty catchy and interesting.  Sweet Dreams is ok.  Video Phone is sexy.  I love Hello.  Ego is pretty great; lots of innuendo I think is apparent.  Scared Of Lonely is ok.    Overall, I really enjoy this album.  It's different from the B'day and Dangerously in Love.  And I think that's pretty awesome because it's a Beyonce that's fresh and interesting and diverse and still very enjoyable.
1932907009|5.0|This is absolutely the best practical guide to screenwriting you'll ever read.   The material is lucid and compelling and should be read by every aspiring screenwriter.  The author uses recent examples that the reader will be able to identify with which is very helpful.  Although the author uses an informal voice and uses a few corny jokes and puns, no space is wasted. Everything is useful.    If you want to write screenplays for indie films, for purely artistic value then I do not recommend this book. It is for those who wish to screenwrite for the big screens. But even if you do write for artistic value, I still think you might get something out of it.    Remember, this book is for those who wish to write and SELL a screenplay; so it's not just about how to write a good story. It's also about how to sell your good story to studio executives.
B001F290E4|3.0|If anyone was going to cover classic Soul, Seal is one of the singers who's got the chops to do it.  But, I've got some fundamental questions as both a fan of Seal's back in the beginning and someone who came up listening to the original artists who first wrote and performed these songs.     I'm not saying Seal's not talented, but generally a covers CD means an artist is in a slump and I haven't considered Seal in that position.  Well, and hiring a pop producer like David Foster to produce doesn't seem like the way to treat the music.      And honestly, can anyone do \\"A Change is Going to Come\\" better than Sam Cooke?  \\"This is a Man's World\\" just doesn't sound the same in 2008 as it did back when James Brown did it--we've come a lot further.      Don't get me wrong.  The songs are good--and I'm definitely keeping the CD, but I still prefer the originals.  What I'm hoping from this effort is a revival of the original artists and Seal getting inspired to go back and do an original CD, because nobody does Seal better than Seal.

B00169N0BK|4.0|I decided to get the Colormunki after struggling for over a year to get my Canon Pro9000 printer to produce prints that were consistently accurate representations of my photos, as they looked on my monitor - I had a monitor calibrator, but that's only one part of what you need in color management. I had used generic profiles for the paper I was using in the past and did all thing things you are supposed to do with the color management settings to get things right, but still experienced highly inconsistent results. After much reading, I determined that getting custom profiles for my printer/paper combinations might be the way to go.  The Colormunki allows you to profile your printer specifically for the paper you are using, in addition to calibrating your monitor.<br /><br />The profiler controls are easily understood and engaged; in order to profile the printer you will need to use at least two sheets of whatever paper you are profiling, and you will need to profile for each type of paper you use - each paper gets its own custom profile - so there is some initial expenditure of ink and paper to get your profiles ready. But that's nothing compared to the ink and paper you would have wasted trying to get an acceptable print without a custom profile, so I don't see that as a disadvantage.<br /><br />Things did not go smoothly at first though - you're supposed to use the Colormunki to scan a series of color patches and when I first printed out my color patches my printer was apparently low on magenta and did not properly print out the patches that had magenta in it.  I was unaware of that, and as I attempted to scan the patches, the Colormunki would simply tell me the scan had failed and not offer any tips as to where to begin locating the point of failure.  It wasn't until I used the online help and wandered in and out of several articles (their online article resource is not well-organized) that I finally stumbled on a sentence that pointed me in the right direction.  Once over that hurdle, the profiling proceeded very quickly and very easily.  I was then able to make more profiles without any hitches at all.  But my review gets 4 stars instead of 5, as I believe the makers of Colormunki could have done a much better job in creating and organizing the help documentation.  There needs to be more of an effort on their part to address the questions that might arise for a user that has no knowledge of the finer points of color profiling - their help documentation seems to gloss over a number of things, or assume that the user would already know them.  Given that the product is marketed to the general consumer, this is potentially a serious misstep on their part.<br /><br />I cannot speak for the projector profiler feature as I do not have a use for that and have not tested it.<br /><br />In summary, I've seen a vast improvement in the color accuracy of my prints since using the Colormunki, but be aware that troubleshooting any problems with this product can lead to a lot of frustration if you don't already have the expertise that  would help you know where to start looking.t hurdle, the profiling proceeded very quickly and very easily.

B001GQACGE|1.0|What a disappointment, I had a hard time with the title, but then when you looked at the price and what you where getting I have a hard time saying that Beyonce cares much about who has made here popular.  Artist need to remember that with about a throng of fans supporting your work, you are just a good voice at church choir.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Do you like a good board game that requires more thinking than luck? A little skill compared to random success? Then this is the game for you.<br />We love playing Settlers and also have purchased the add ons of Seafarers and also Knights. The game requires some strategy and some planning in order to do well and win. Assessing proper location, stockpiling resources, placing the robber or pirate, undermining other players -- well it all adds up to great fun -- and perhaps even a friendly argument or two.<br />Highly recommended for teens and adults who can grasp the overall concept and outwit opponents to claim victory. It is not usually a fast game and does take awhile to set up and get going. Enjoy!

B00139W3NE|1.0|Wow- I have to be honest and say this is the Worst movie I have seen to date. I had heard about the controversy about this movie & religion...and on a 13 hour flight from Australia back to LA- I thought it would be good to watch. I mean the cast alone- had to be decent. It also would give me a chance to watch it before I showed it to my 6 year old. WOW- was I glad I watched it first! First off- do not let you 6 year old watch this movie.  IT IS NOT A SMALL CHILD'S MOVIE. A) It is scary. It has deamons in it - that are vicious. Not only that the kids are being kidnapped - stolen. Ok- what child ,and parent for that fact, would not be freaked out by that. Seriously - if I let my kids watch this movie- they would be sleeping with us for the next week. Trust me- not for elementary kids.<br />B) It's dumb. The movie goes very fast- and apparently leaves out the majority of the information that a person who has NOT read the book needs in order to figure out what the heck is going on. If you have read the book- then you will get it. The rest of us- just still trying to figure all the weird scary stuff in the movie by reading reviews on Amazon;)<br />Overall- the movie was VERY DISAPPOINTING. I am not even going to mention the entire controversy with the relgion aspect of the movie. That is another can of worms. Bottom Line - Save your precious time - and go rent Narnia. You'll be happy you did. I am still wishing I could get those 2 hours of my life back that I wasted watching this movie.
B0012QE4Q2|2.0|After watching for a couple of weeks, at the rate of one episode per night, Michael Hirst's TV series «The Tudors\\" [[ASIN:B000P12LWY The Tudors - The Complete First Season]][[ASIN:B001EO748M The Tudors - Season 2]], I was appalled by the bad acting, the awful dialogue and the general lack of artistry of this movie. Only the lighting of some interiors, deftly imitated from Vermeer, and a few pretty --yet trite-- open air scenes earns it a second star with me. Otherwise, it can serve only as a foil against which one can better appreciate Hirst's apt and often incisive dialogue, as well as the incredibly lively and attractive acting of Rhys Meyer and Dorman as Henry and Ann (not to mention the splendid performances of the actors who impersonate Wolsey, Thomas More, Catherine of Aragon, the Earl of Wiltshire, and almost every other significant character). Historical accuracy might not stand high in the minds of the authors of either production, but where the soap opera succeeds in providing a quite impressive view of power struggles in 16th century England (and Europe), the present movie does not make it even as a sordid sex story.
B001ED7C58|3.0|I was pleasantly surprised by the soundtrack. \\"Eyes on Fire\\",  \\"Supermassive Black Hole\\", and \\"Bella's Lullaby\\" were some of my faves. I think the real surprise (for me anyway) was Rob Pattinson (who plays Edward in the movie) can sing! And boy does he sound good. \\"Never Think\\" was far and away the standout track for me. It was worth buying the soundtrack for that track alone. Can't wait to see the movie :)
B001GKYBXA|5.0|Is this Paul McCartney trying to not sound like Paul McCartney? Or is this Paul McCartney's alter ego? Either way, it's Paul McCartney sounding fresh, alive, and better than ever. A departure from the two previous Fireman CDs and quite different from his last two, yet fabulous, solo releases. I say buy it.
B00066VUPM|4.0|Best songs from most albums, songs 1 thru 10 are my favorite. Listen to this album often !!!
B001DU8T6S|5.0|I was always able to appreciate the enormous and indisputable talent of Queen. However, they were never really my cup of tea. Bad Company w/Paul Rodgers however is one of my all time favorite bands. I never owned a Queen album and never owned a Bad Company album without Paul Rodgers.    Combining Queen's virtuosity with the likes of Paul Rodgers actually makes sense after hearing the result. This CD to me is heavily flavored with Paul's (Bad Company) influence and Paul finally has the band to equal his level of vocal perfection and writing skill.    Rarely do the remains of two magnificent bands come together and hit a grand slam like this.
068815333X|5.0|Prayers for Rain had been in my TBR pile for quite a while--several years at least. Surely not since 1999, though my copy is a new, non-remaindered hardcover, so probably since 2000. I don't feel that bad about leaving it there, because there are still no new Kenzie/Gennaro stories, and it's a bit sad knowing I've read the last one in my TBR pile.    The series is about PI Patrick Kenzie, his complex professional/romantic relationship with his partner Angie Gennaro, and their psychotic but extremely loyal pal Bubba Rogowski.    This 5th book in the series starts with Kenzie & Gennaro split up, both personally and professionally, and Patrick's not taking it well, reevaluating his life as Angie had. A young woman comes to him for help with a simple stalker, and he solves the problem without breaking a sweat, or even seeing her again.    Six months later, the same young woman, who'd been the epitome of \\"sweet girl next door\\", has committed suicide. The fact that she'd called him 3 months earlier and he'd forgotten to get back to her makes Patrick curious, so he starts to check things out. The more he learns, the more curious he becomes.    Before long, he's enlisted Angie & Bubba's help, and they find themselves afoul of the local mob, and embroiled in a case that's looking more sinister by the minute.    It's dark, with no easy answers, and Kenzie's brand of solution is always satisfying--violence when necessary, but always with a psychological angle, never pointless brute force. There's also humor in the darkness, like Bubba complaining when he doesn't get to just blow something up.    What grabs me about this, and the other books in the series, are the complex characters. We get the motivations of everyone, not just the main characters, and they all ring true. And yes, I've really enjoyed the ups and downs of the Kenzie/Gennaro relationship. It's not a sweet, happy ever after one, but it sucked me in.    I guess I'll have to break down now and get Lehane's non-series books. I'm assured they're just as good, though having seen the movie version of Mystic River, I'm a little wary of reading it.
B0013FSL3E|1.0|I am just about ready to give up on Pixar.  Go back and look at the depth of the stories in Toy Story or Bug's life--the humor and the grand themes.  The last 3-4 Pixar offerings are straight out of the worst of Hollywood conformity and unoriginality.  Are people confusing great animation with great stories?  Wall E was maudlin, predictable and Cars rewritten. Boy, car,  or male robot is lost--female of same type helps him find his way or himself.  Pixar has run out of good ideas, and maybe even ideas.  They are currently at the point where they need a new direction, having used most of the usual environments, space, ocean, nature, imagination, and industry.  They could try fantasy next.  Whatever they do, they need to  get rid of the tired formula that has taken them from \\"infinity and beyond\\" to mediocrity and the bank.
0060764899|4.0|I put the series in my TBR pile when it dawned on me that I'd never read them. My kids have, and I'd read this one aloud to them several times, but it seemed like a cultural thing I was missing out on, so in they went. The Lemony Snicket books are in there, too.    I have no idea what to say about The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe that hasn't been said. I don't even know how I feel about it, because the story's so very familiar. There's the heavy-handed Christian allegory, I suppose, which doesn't take much to uncover. And there's really not a lot of depth to it, nor are the characters all that well-developed.    But it is, after all, a children's story, a fast-moving tale of adventure and imagination, and Good vs. Evil. Hopefully, I'll have more to say on the subsequent books, which are new to me.    One aside: reading this always brings to mind my daughter's kindergarten best friend, who maintained that she did have a doorway to Narnia in her bedroom closet. This frustrated my realist daughter no end, because she couldn't convince her friend that it was just a story.
B000003TAW|5.0|Luis Mejia - Weezer debut album is a perfect swing from a classic 90s' experience. When everyone was producing independent, underground, distorted garage-like rock, Weezer twisted this tiresome face of music with their melodic power pop, specially noticed due to the album's heavy guitar use; and yet it is simple and catchy. And rather than used-up rockers, the band's mood was fresh and innovating, with their classic-guy looks (some may say it's geeky, but the music is very distant from this) mixed with normal laid-back style gives off the band's unique and lovely personality. Songs like \\"Buddy Holly\\" \\"Undone-The Sweater Song\\" can stick into your memory very smoothly, and so both became later recognized icons in 90s' music, while the greatly arranged pieces, specially \\"My Name Is Jonas\\" and \\"Holiday\\", break the monotony and makes the album much more worthy and delightful. The band's honest sense of humor, chill-out mood, mixed with a non-usual power pop style makes Blue Album simply perfect; take it as you may, it always ends up being incredible. Even if you don't go far with Weezer from here, this is the album anyone can listen to in their repertory.
B00169N0BK|3.0|We have a custom studio with many monitors, a printer and a projector.  Our Spyder is long in the tooth and won't do projectors, hence the Munki.<br /><br />Numerous other posters complained about the crummy software, but didn't dissuade me because I never saw all the problems listed in one place.  Here we go:<br />Disc doesn't have actual code, just sends you to their site to download 250MB of file.<br />Link didn't work, had to go directly there to get it. Download gagged twice before success.<br />Limited to load on 3 machines, which is not enough for us, but I figured a way to cheat it.<br />No \\"CRT\\" choice in cal menu, use LCD.<br />Only 3 fixed color temps.<br />Won't handle multiple monitors in Win XP without a prog from MS called Color Tool.<br />No gamma control.<br />No profile naming.<br /><br />After fighting thru all that, then the hardware fun starts:<br />Hang straps are a joke.  Most people who cal also have a screen hood so they CAN'T work.<br />Device frequently gets in an endless CAL/SET loop and has to be reinitialized.<br />Who thought of this stupid zipper case that must be removed and replaced during the CAL sequence?<br />The profile created is pretty good on both my displays and the projector.  Probably better than the Spyder BUT, the \\"measure room light\\" option is whacko.  Turn it off and the profile looks like a 60's album cover even in complete darkness.<br /><br />The fact is, I know of nothing near the price that will do all this.  Version 2 probably will be fine , but be prepared for a load of hassle.
B000002VQQ|5.0|Patti Smith's classic \\"Horses\\" is as much a theatre piece in audio form as it is a rock n roll album. Smith's instances of spoken word poetry certainly make you feel like you're listening to more than a rock album. And this album really did bring me to understanding of the true powers of music, a revelation that I've never realized until I heard this album. In this album, it truly is the best of times, it truly is the worst of times; it brings out the best and worst that life can give you, through the powers of poetry and music. It can make you happy, sad; it can make you laugh, cry. As I said before, this truly has the dimensions of a grand theatre piece, just in the form of a rock album.<br /><br />I'll never look at any other album the same way again. Patti Smith's \\"Horses\\" is a truly life-changing album.
B001LMRCP2|5.0|I was disappointed when I first heard the \\"Viva La Vida\\" version of Life In Technicolor... it had such a GREAT beat but it ended so soon...    It's great to hear the \\"full version\\" with lyrics!  It's such a great song, it's worth it to buy this EP just for that one song... but the others are great as well!    'Postcards' is a beautiful piano piece.  'Lost+' with Jay-Z is kinda weird, but interesting.  'Lovers in Japan' is one of my favorite songs on \\"Viva\\", and this remix is almost identical... but without the extra song tacked on the end, and a slightly different effect in one part.    I haven't listened to the other songs completely but they sound like classic Coldplay, especially the beautiful 'Prospekt's March'...  but this album is definitely worth 5 stars for this price!!
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|Don't be misled by some of the comments on this page.  This is NOT, I repeat, NOT the 3D version of the film.  Apparently, you can only get the 3D version on blu-ray, assuming of course that you own a blu-ray DVD player.  According to Amazon, 85% of customers buy this version, while only 4% by the blu-ray version.  Maybe that 85% thought they were buying the 3D version, too.  Warner Home Video should be ashamed of misleading fans of the movie in this way.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I love this soundtrack!! Especially the song Eyes On Fire by Blue Foundation. I think that song could not of been more perfect for this Movie. I listen to this CD everyday. Robert Pattinson's song is also great!!! I think they did a wonderful job in making this Soundtrack!!!
B001HDO4Z6|5.0|If you're a fan of Viva la Vida, this is a no-brainer. I liked \\"Life in Technicolor\\" on the original album, and having the vocal version on this album knocks it out of the park! For that song alone, this album is worth the purchase.
B000ZN802W|3.0|First, I'll get my admitted bias out of the way: Whenever 'Hollywood' gets a hold of something that is hawked as \\"based on true events\\", this should be a huge red flag to viewers that they should make it their business to research the alleged \\"based on true events\\" in order to separate the Hollywood tendency to engage in both directorial \\"creative license\\" and \\"for the sake of the plot\\" alterations. Unfortunately, there are folks who see the proverbial 'Silver Screen' [or book [Jon Krakauer] for that matter] version of the alleged \\"facts\\" and that's the end of it.<br /><br />So too, there is in this particular case both in the book and in the subsequent movie to 'romanticize' Chris McCandless and that his eventual death by starvation, yes, I said 'starvation' and not plant poisoning, and his venturing into the wilderness only to die there was somehow a \\"noble cause\\" [!] and, what then, worthy of emulation?<br /><br />Take the time to read the autopsy report and the additional [which later morphed to 'moldy seeds' which purportedly prevents the digestion process and hence 'kills over time'] when the plant poisoning per se could not be scientifically supported [after analysis] and note the differences in the plant 'culprit' between the book and the movie] with regard to the alleged death via accidental plant poisoning. Some even suggest it was on purpose for the, and I quote now, \\"ultimate self-sacrifice statement\\" [sic]! Look at the list of those things found in Chris's possession when he was found dead in the bus by moose hunters 'including' a map and including, inter alia, money found in a compartment of his pack. And while some may actually 'relate' to previous wordage from McCandless where his parents were relegated by him as \\"idiots\\" [sic], it remains interesting that his otherwise close sibling relationship to his sister finds her written off for two years as well ... along with the rest of society in general save for those who could assist Chris in his singular quest for both Thoreau-like isolation and Jack London type wilderness living albeit in a most unforgiving environment. And no prior experience in such endeavors.<br /><br />There is a DVD out by Ron Lamothe [Terra Incognita Films -- see their website and read the Krakauer book rebuttal piece] based on a Chris McCandless documentary and decidedly worth a look. It's called \\"The Call of the Wild.\\" Hence my Paul Harvey analogy and \\"the rest of the story.\\" So too, there are countless essays on the matter but various of which offer 'documented' input [versus conjecture] that was not incorporated into the Jon Krakauer book nor the subsequent 2007 Sean Penn film nor corrected therein [although Krakauer 'modified' his view on the plant poisoning to a matter of inherently poisonous 'moldy seeds'] when the 'rest of the story' was related. There have also been essays with regard to psychological/psychiatric issues and worth reading. Interesting here too when such 'mental' facility issues are discussed at various and sundry websites with regard to the actions of Chris McCandless, there is almost always various voices 'countering' such psychological/psychiatric speculation and protracted discussion as \\"pure hogwash\\" [sic] via the old chestnut defense of \\"medicalizing dissent\\" as if to suggest that McCandless actions were perfectly normal and \\"entirely sane\\" and \\"happen all the time\\" ...]. What may also amaze readers is the myriad of websites out there where everything from Alaska folks 'per se' are supposedly \\"all anti-McCandless haters by nature\\" [! -- sic] or \\"Society 'is' sick, overly materialistic and evil [...] Chris did what he had to do!\\" [! -- sic] but then as more than a few wags put it, \\"... when you abandon your family, your car, your friends and you give away all your money [$24,000 grad school savings] and burn the rest on hand and head for the wilderness for which you are totally ill prepared to deal with and survive in the process .. this is not so much an attempt to 'find yourself', as much as a matter of already being quite lost!\\"<br /><br />Read 'the rest of the story' -- it's out there and if 'only' to get a balance between the book and the movie.

B001F0VHEM|5.0|I've never paid much attention to Pink before.  I know she came out a long with a lot of other cookie cutter singers that I found rather boring and not worth my time to listen to, so I basically brushed Pink off too.  Until I heard her new cuts off her new cd on a couple different TV shows and they got stuck in my head and were quite enjoyable, like 'So What' and 'FunHouse'.  So I went out and bought the cd for those two songs alone and was very happy to find that most of the cd was pretty good.  I like her fun songs and I really like her ballads, which really surprised me.  Pink can really sing a ballad, her 'I don't believe you' and 'Sober' are excellent.  I had to work on Thanksgiving so I took the CD in with me and listened to it about 3 times.  If you buy this CD I don't think you'll be disappointed, it's fun, emotional and heart felt, it also I feel shows Pink's maturity.  I think I'm a new fan.

B0014VPFTA|3.0|John Mayer couldn't have come to me with less of a negative vibe than he did when I was gifted this cd by a friend who is a huge fan. I have always liked her choices in music but she didn't help Mayer's cause by professing that she has often envisioned humping his leg during the many times she's seen him in concert. Her lust only underscored a common criticism of this artist; that he is more college girl heartthrob than cool guitar hero. It doesn't help that I'm beyond sick of seeing this guy's mug every time I stand on line in a supermarket and come face to face with the bathroom journals that scream at you from their perch next to the jerky and candy bars. On top of all of this, a particular interview I read revealed him to be arrogant and buying into his own hype. Therefore, I would have to say that I was not thinking much of what John Mayer's music would be like.<br />Well...I like it! John Mayer is not the second coming of anyone, he isn't the greatest guitarist I've ever heard, and he's exceedingly derivative in tone and vocals. It's easy to imagine the casual radio listener mistaking one of his songs for a handful of others who he sounds almost copyright-infringement like. But...it's good stuff nonetheless.<br />I like this one better than other cds I've subsequently listened to as there is a maturity and a bit less of the pop-idol-to-heartbroken-women vibe going on. \\"Belief,\\" \\"Vultures,\\" \\"Stop This Train,\\" and \\"Slow Dancing in a Burning Room\\" are all really nice songs full of sweet beats, his vibrato-laden Strat licks, and intelligent if, at times, a bit overly-earnest lyrics (but, hey, if it works for Don Henley...).<br />This is a cd that is easy to listen to, guitar-rich, and sometimes poignant and you rarely get all of those traits even from some of the many masters that Mayer seems to mimic. Ignore the E! gossip, his legion of lusty fans, the wannabe comparisons to Hendrix, Vaughn, et al, and even his unfortunate lack of humility and just give the music a chance. John Mayer's music is good stuff...but I still don't have the slightest interest in humping his leg.John Mayer's music is good stuff...but I still don't have the slightest interest in humping his leg.

0765342294|5.0|Imagine a futuristic earth-world where buggers and astronauts has replaced cowboys and Indians as children's make-believe game of choice, space travel has replaced automobiles, and the planet's citizens' primary concern is to defeat an alien race before it can annihilate them.<br /><br />After the powers that be decide that his too cruel brother, Peter, and too mild sister, Valentine, don't have what it takes, a third Wiggin child, Andrew \\"Ender\\" Wiggin, is created in hopes that his intelligence, abilities and temperament will prove to be just right for his sole purpose in life: to become an officer in the International Fleet capable of defeating the enemy. Constantly watched (through the use of a device implanted in his brain) and tested, at age six, he is strong-armed into choosing to attend Battle School, where, they tell him, (p 24) \\"It's like playing buggers and astronauts-except that you have weapons that work, and fellow soldiers fighting beside you, and your whole future and the future of the human race depends on how well you learn, how well you fight.\\" And where he won't be eligible for his first leave until he is twelve-years old. Might one small boy have what it takes to survive the rigorous training, defeat the buggers, and save the human race?<br /><br />Ender's Game, especially in the detail and visual descriptions of the battle scenes, is a wonderful sci-fi story about a brave little boy who holds the future of the human race in his hands. With a relatively high incidence of profanity (illegitimate male, the hot place), violence (including death), and enough references to flatulence to tire even the silliest of children, the suggested age of \\"10 and up\\" might be a bit in the low side. Also good: The Giver by Lois Lowery, Stranger in a Strange Land by Robert Heinlein (though sexist), and Flowers for Algernon by Daniel Keyes.

B00104QSOM|5.0|More than an epic tale of an early 20th Century oilman, this is a fascinating study of the greed for power and what it does to a man.  We meet Daniel Plainview down the bottom of a mine, exerting himself in mind-numbingly monotonous and backbreaking work, looking for gold or silver.  He is a man willing to endure pain and humiliation to grasp more money, or more power.  As he quickly moves from gold to black gold, he becomes more powerful, and his ruthlessness and underhandedness become more and more apparent, combined with the charisma required to persuade landowners to part with the mineral rights of their property.  We learn about how he sees other people when he adopts a boy who he finds useful to put a kind face on his activities, and how he treats a man appears claiming to be his half brother.  The movie kicks into gear though when he meets an equally power hungry man in the unlikely form of the young faith healer and preacher, to whom he takes a seemingly instant dislike.  With the relationships with these three characters, we see his dilemna- his power is only something if he can pass it on, but when he sees only the worst in other people, how can he?  Who will be worthy of the three to take on his mantle..?  The style of the movie has some stunning direction which tells us much of the story through scenes and images, rather than words, yet this is married with an intelligent, absorbing and uncompromising script.  The music is daringly inventive, although with me the jury is out whether it is a success or a distraction.  Daniel Day-Lewis turns in yet another 100% authentic and believable performance, creating a chilling and yet at times charismatic character, and Paul Dano is remarkable as the young preacher.  Sure, women are given little to no role in the story, and it is unremitting in its bleakness, at times feeling like it has been designed to within an inch of its cinematic life.  It's not going to be to everyone's taste.. However the authenticity, stunning performances and script that demands the viewer engage in some thought, have created what might just be a bona fide masterpiece, even with its flaws.
B0000X2DMA|4.0|A few months ago I got into Epica from their newest album \\"The Divine Conspiracy\\" I really loved that album so I decided to buy \\"Consign To Oblivion. I never got into that album, I found it really weak and generic with no songs whatsoever that stood out. That made me very wary of getting this album, but I did anyway and I was pleasantly surprised.    The songs on this are quite original and all stand out in their own way. This is a great album well worth your money. I can't fault it in any way. I'm giving it four stars because it is not a \\"perfect\\" album, but realistically, this is about as good as it gets.    Maybe Epica's Best!

1416550518|5.0|The House at Riverton reminded me in some ways of a Rebecca DuMaurier novel in its setting and atmosphere--an old house, a wealthy family, long-kept secrets.  Where it differs is in the main character, not a member of the family but a long-time servant who observes the interactions of the family members and their guests in their gilded environment but is outside of it.  The story is a fascinating glimpse into the time that young poor girls went \\"into service\\" and became full time members of great households, who took the notion of duty to that family seriously, and kept their secrets carefully.  The story is told in flashbacks from the current day, as a modern day researcher carefully pries the truth about a mysterious death and the role of the two daughters of the house in that event.  This adds the dimension of the narrator herself remembering what seems to be an impossibly distant world, having lived through the latter 20th century life of Britain as well, and yet she had been a part of it, and no one thought to ask her her thoughts on it and memories of it until it was almost too late.  I found the main story suspenseful and the framing story to be touching and interesting, but most of all I came away from this book feeling like I had soaked in the atmosphere and reality of a world long gone from the scene.  Very enjoyable.

B001GZ6QDS|3.0|So where do I begin?    I, like many, many other fans, was so excited about this movie that I scoured the internet looking for any tidbit of information about The Dark Knight on a daily basis. I was excited about Heath Ledger as The Joker, and Christian Bale is one of my favorite actors as well.  Also, after seeing Batman Begins, I trusted Nolan to do this movie right. When I went to see the movie on opening day, the digital projector at the theater wouldn't work, which set an ominous tone for the day. I remember about halfway through TDK, hoping that it would get better, and to a certain extent it did, but I will say that overall it did fall short of my expectations, and didn't come anywhere close to the \\"masterpiece\\" that I kept hearing people call it. Here is a list of the pros, and cons, of TDK, in my opinion:    First of all, the movie was too long. Now, I don't mind watching long movies, but the truth is, that after the story arc of the Joker trying to force one of the ferries to blow the other up, it should have ended there (albeit with an ending apropos to the overall story). I don't believe that the two-face story arc (at least him going on a killing rampage) should have made it into this movie at all. In the comic books and graphic novels, two-face is a main villain, and his arc probably should have been the main story line of the third movie, if there is one. I know that there has been speculation that he may not be dead, but the whole two-face \\"revenge\\" thing was too jammed together to fit it all into this movie.    The other \\"con\\" about TDK ties into my first point, and that is that Heath Ledger did such an amazing job as The Joker, that he could've, and should've, carried this whole movie (really, he kinda did that anyways), without having Nolan introduce two-face as a secondary (thirdly, if you count Scarecrow's cameo) villain.    Thirdly, and I know the fan-boys will crucify me for saying this, is that Katie Holmes should've been brought back if at all possible.  I've heard the rumors that she wouldn't commit to TDK because she knew her character would be killed off, but still, a change of actressed mid-stream disrupts the continuity of the film.  Overall, I do believe that Gyllenhall is the better actress, but I don't believe she was right for this particular role. With Holmes as Dawson, we as viewers would've had more of an emotional investment in her story line, and I for one just didn't really care about Gyllenhall's Dawson at all.    Fourth, I thought that the ancillary characters, such as the mob bosses, were not developed to their full capacity.  Again, in the books, Maroni is a fairly important character, and Nolan kind of turned him into a pussy in TDK, at least near the end.    Finally, let me just say that the whole \\"bat-sonar\\" or whatever the hell that was, was just a horrible idea.  It looked really unrealistic, didn't make any sense (spatially), and wasn't believable.  From that point on I just kinda checked out of the movie and realized that it was really overhyped.    Now, to the smaller, more petty stuff that really bothered me about TDK:    I really hated how Nolan deviated from the books regarding how two-face's face was scarred; c'mon, why have Sal Maroni in the movie if he's not going to be the one thrwoing the acid?  Also, I for one did not like the makeup job they did with two-face...I know its a comic-book movie, but it just didnt look real at all.    The helicopter crash was horribly done using CG, which is surprising, because there was very little (readily recognizable) CG used in Batman Begins.    A bit more screen time for the Scarecrow, perhaps a face to face meeting with the Joker or something would've been nice.    I really don't enjoy Aaron Eckhardt as an actor, and I still think he was wrong for the role.    The whole \\"Gordon gets shot and fakes his own death\\" story line was unnecessary to the overall plot line.     What was up with Dawson and Batman falling from the building, landing on the car, and simply walking away? That was a long ways down. Also, why did Nolan show Maroni falling off the roof, breaking his legs/ankles, and walking shortly thereafter? Those kind of missteps, in my opinion, were small, but really detracted from the film as a whole.    Now, the good:    Heath Ledger's Joker was amazing.  I know that some people do not believe that his joker is what the joker \\"should\\" be, but c'mon, it more of a \\"21st century\\" joker. At the same time, I don't really believe he deserves an oscar for this performance though.  That being said, he really did carry this movie; without his portrayal of the Joker, it would've been worse than it was.    I did really like the Bat-Pod.  When I saw it in the trailers for the movie, I wasnt sure if Nolan could pull it off, but he did, it was a good addition to the franchise.    Michael Caine, Gary Oldman and Morgan Freeman were good as always, although a bit more from Freeman would've been nice.    Now, all this being said, I'm still buying the movie, and I undoubtedly watch it many more times, but I will always think of what could have been.
6305754969|5.0|\\"They laughed at him, Mississippi. That'll make the difference.\\" -- Wayne to Caan regarding Mitchum<br /><br />Director Howard Hawks once again hooked up with John Wayne to revisit the moral codes and deep loyalty of good men to others who live by this code. As in nearly all films made by this great director, the theme of women being the downfall of good men who still cannot live without them remains prominent. This remake of Rio Bravo is fabulously entertaining and as such stands as one of the truly great films in the genre.<br /><br />Wayne may indeed be marvelous here in one of his best performances, but he has stiff competition from Robert Mitchum and a very young James Caan. The mere fact that Hawks could assemble such a cast is in itself astounding. To have Robert Mitchum and John Wayne together is tantamount to having Gable and Tyrone Power share the screen at their zenith, or Garbo and Sherarer appearing together. Whereas many great films might have one larger than life star whose character you can't take your eyes from, this film has two and a half.<br /><br />The half is for a young James Caan, whose charming and magnetic performance showed his niche in films, and catapulted him to the upper ranks in the minds of many. There is a bit more backstory than in Rio Bravo, as Hawks shows the relationship of  gunfighter Cole Thornton (John Wayne) to his old pal, Sheriff J.P., (Robert Mitchum) who have a long and storied history of riding the trail together. They are two of the four best guns in the west, but the different paths they've chosen has not diminished their friendship or loyalty to each other because they live by the same moral code.<br /><br />Cole inadvertently becomes involved in a range feud in El Dorado over water and gets shot by spunky and very pretty Michelle Carey as Joey, a member of the MacDonald family J.P. is protecting from rancher Bart Jason (Ed Asner) and his hands. Though it doesn't kill him, the bullet cannot be removed, and the spasms it brings to his gun-hand on occasion will come into play when months later he runs into one of the other four fast guns who is heading for El Dorado to work for Jason. Since J.P. has become a drunk and the laughingstock of the town, it seems an easy task.<br /><br />Two of Hawks' favorite themes immediately appear at this juncture; the moral code which binds good men together and the women that can make them crawl into the bottle. James Caan is used for the former as a young riverboat brat avenging the death of the gambler who raised him. He attaches himself to Cole as he heads back to El Dorado. Simply called Mississippi because his real name is of such length and formality, he lives by the same moral code so instantly knows Cole will be heading for El Dorado after hearing about his pal J.P. from slick and dangerous gunman, Christopher George.<br /><br />It is a conversation between George and Wayne which brings out the latter theme; Cole knowing even before George tells him that a woman was the only thing which could have derailed J.P., even knowing the type he would have been such a fool over. Though Rio Bravo had some humor, and a great performance from Dean Martin, El Dorado has more, and it is quite fun for the viewer watching Cole sober up J.P., with help from Mississippi's concoction, and J.P.'s old Indian-fighter pal, Bull (Arthur Hunnicutt).<br /><br />There is the usual stuff here we've seen many times, but here it is done in such entertaining fashion we can't wait to see the outcome. The conversation near the end between J.P. and Cole, who may have reversed roles due to lovely Charlene Holt as Maudie, is a riot! Also hilarious is Mississippi's inability to shoot straight, even with a shotgun! Almost lost in the male camaraderie and bonding is the smaller role of Marina Ghane as Maria. She was quite lovely, however.<br /><br />Hawks seemed to return to these themes again and again in his films, albeit in westerns or crime dramas. This is truly one of the great westerns. It does not get touted like some because there is no hidden symbolism; it is straightforward and everyone can see what Hawks is saying. For my money, however, I prefer Hawks to the more heralded western makers like John Ford. A nice western score by Sinatra arranger Nelson Riddle, of all people, and some great western art by Olaf Wieghorst used for the opening credits add to what is already one of the most fascinating films in the genre ever filmed. A must have film for fans of Hawks, Wayne, and Mitchum.ere is no hidden symbolism; it is straightforward and everyone can see what Hawks is saying.

B000VNMMQG|4.0|Not what I expected but an excellent true story of one man's long struggle to end the slave trade in England.  The acting is very good and the director gives viewers a small taste of the horrors of slavery without being too graphic.  Not recommended for young kids and even tweens without parental presence; some scenes are very depressing.  Highly recommended viewing, especially in light of recent world events in Darfur and similar locations.  There still exist people who need help to survive.

0312427999|5.0|For the first nine chapters of the SHOCK DOCTRINE by Naomi Klein I could not put the book down until I had finished reading it word for word.  Having been suitably impressed I immediately purchased three additional copies and have given them out to professional colleagues who I know enjoy reading about history and economics, especially in regards to humanitarian and development issues in third world countries, and their volatile causes/treatments.    I work in a team of people providing business advice on risk, governance, financial viability, and management issues within government circles.  We rely on evidence based information and examples of best practice standards in an attempt to form meaningful, arms length, positive future based recommendations to safeguard the needs of various stakeholders.  This is done to uphold a particular values and belief system within the culture we operate in.    Naomi Klein's SHOCK DOCTRINE provides a stunning example of all of these factors - the theory, the principles to be applied from this theory, the political element, the execution, the results, and the feedback and refinement of the theory.  The context is the way in which free-market economic revolutions require the subjugation of the psychological free will of the people to form their own consensus, and their own democracy, to be accepted.  While I'm still slowly digesting the rest of the book, one of the most compelling observations I think KLEIN makes early on, is that purist capitalism does not allow for the presence of competing or tempering world views; it requires a monopoly on ideology.  This monopoly condition is a total contradiction in the free-market theory which is supposed to actively encourage competition so that ALL consumer's utility can be maximized at the \\"bliss point\\" under Pareto Optimality conditions i.e. having the ability to execute CHOICE is the defining benefit of liberalism, and free-markets over state run command economies.    If you're interested in the use of university silo economics based research, psychological trauma, their theoretical underpinnings and how these have been imposed on real people and communities, and the variable results (some negative, some positive), the SHOCK DOCTRINE is essential and excellent reading.  You don't have to agree or disagree with everything presented here; the value of a good non-fiction book like Klein's is in the evidence base, and how carefully linked the conclusion is made to this base. Definitely food for thought.

0517548232|4.0|Particularly appropriate for these times (even many decades after it was written), Hazlitt's Economics in One Lesson offers an alternative to the traditional Keynesian economic theory of the 20th Century. This book is a fairly easy read for non-economists and, though a bit repetitive towards the end, quite enlightening. I'd recommend this book strongly for any student of macro economics or anyone curious in what is happening to the global economy.
B000Y179KO|3.0|Long Road Out Of Eden is an album the Eagles may as well not released. It is far from \\"classic Eagles\\". The best song on the disc is \\"Busy Being Fabulous\\" which is also the closest to the Eagles style, though more the flavor of a Don Henley single. Timothy Schmitt is good on \\"I Don't Want To Hear Any More\\", but the rest of the set is pretty much like a \\"tamed down, ready to retire Eagles sound\\" in my opinion. This is far far from the \\"Hotel California\\" days. If you buy it with expectations based on past Eagles songs, you will be disappointed.
B001GQACGO|5.0|What can I say? This album reminds me of a \\"sophmore\\" CD as it relates to trying out something new. In my opinion, it works big time. If you are expecting the \\"Crazy in Love, Upgrade You, Bootylicious\\" Beyonce of old, you will be surely dissappointed.     In this one album, she has quieted her critics. The lyrics are great and while some of the ballads don't show the true extent of what we've seen from Beyonce, they are nonetheless performed nicely. What I hear is growth and maturity. Admittedly, some of the songs could have been very easily sung by Carrie Underwood, Kelly Clarkson or even Faith Hill. However, there is only one Beyonce. I appreiciate the cross-over appeal on this album. Unlike other albums, she really makes use of her lower register and shies away from her usual vocal gymnastics.     BY FAR, this is her best album to date. The question is whether her fans (not the haters) will appreciate the non-formulaic approach to this album.

044024238X|2.0|Kinsella drops the ball on a novel that, in its last fifty pages, cannot sustain its own plot. With a promising premise and a quirky enough female protagonist, The Undomestic Goddess starts off as a vaguely amusing escapist adventure. Everything about the novel is average - the situations and humor are enough to keep a reader interested but unhappy at the conclusion. The sentiments are transparent and treacly, and the funny situations don't quite hit their mark. Kinsella's work is usually hilarious, but the book is soon lost to plot twists that become overwhelming, as they all occur in the final act. The awkward moments that are supposed to carry the novel are unnervingly contrived and absolutely unimaginable. A suspension of disbelief is unbelievably hard to procure. The romance is sweet and comfortingly moves along to its obvious finale. The entire text is a piece of cheap chocolate: soothing yet bland, fun while it lasts, but in the end, doesn't keep you satisfied.

0439023483|5.0|This is the first Young Adult book that I've read in a long while and I must say it was awesome.  This book hooked me right from the get go.  It's set in the ruins of North America after wars and rebellions have destroyed the states and now they are split up into 12 different districts.  In order to show control over the districts the \\"Capitol\\" requires each district to send one boy and one girl between the ages of 12 and 18 to compete in a competition called \\"The Hunger Games.\\"   In these games the contestants are taken to a wilderness arena and are forced to fight to the death while it's all being captured on camera for the Capitol's entertainment.    This book was great.  The characters are written very well and the author goes outside the norms with the story and kept me guessing for pretty much the whole book.  The society in which they live in is very original and just really fun to read about.  This is a very fast passed book with lots of action and not tons of descriptions that bog down the pace.  There is just so much imagination in this book that you can't help but get lost in this book.  I read this really fast and can't wait for the next one to come out.
0316017922|5.0|Before reading Outliers, I would have said, \\"Malcolm Gladwell is a literary genius.\\" Now I have to take it down a notch and acknowledge that Gladwell is a hard-working and somewhat lucky person who took full advantage of the opportunities afforded him by his upbringing and environment. Between The Tipping Point, Blink and Outliers, Gladwell has created a trilogy of stimulating and thought-provoking works that shine light on otherwise unexplored ways our world develops its people.<br /><br />Outliers is a nine chapter piece that builds a case for how \\"Outliers\\" (people who seem to live outside everyday experience) truly develop. Common wisdom says geniuses are born that way. Gladwell debunks that myth, with a mixture of serious studies and anecdotal stories to balance our understanding that \\"It takes a village,\\" to raise an extraordinary person.<br /><br />The Introduction, \\"The Roseto Mystery,\\" and the Epilogue, \\"A Jamaican Story,\\" are as compelling as the actual chapters. From the city of Roseto, Pennsylvania, we learn that longevity of life need not be solely a factor of good genes or good health, but also good community. From the Jamaican story we learn that Gladwell himself is a product of a wonderful set of divine circumstances.<br /><br />Chapter one, \\"Opportunity,\\" builds the case that early advantages (such as being born January 1 and playing a sport whose cutoff date enables you to be oldest in your league) accumulate and often build on one another over time. Accumulate enough advantages and you've got an outlier.<br /><br />Chapter two, \\"The 10,000 Hour Rule,\\" points towards the secret of success for anyone who is willing to work hard enough. Investing 10,000 hours in something you're good at will make you an extraordinary talent. Few people will work that hard on any one sport, hobby, instrument, or discipline. If they do, they almost invariably succeed. In my mind, The 10,000 Hour Rule is so profound that it ought to be classed with other universal numbers like Pi, Planck's Constant, and Avogadro's Number.<br /><br />Chapter three, \\"The Trouble with Geniuses,\\" demonstrates that it takes more than pure smarts to become a success. Chapter four, \\"The Trouble with Geniuses, Part 2,\\" fills in the missing piece: brains plus people-skills learned from our home environment is the winning combination.<br /><br />Chapter five, \\"The Three Lessons of Joe Flom,\\" observes that being born in the right place, at the right time, to the right family system is a key component in developing as an outlier. Chapter six, \\"Harlan, Kentucky,\\" begins a new thread that points towards \\"the village\\" aspect of personal development. That is, the culture we are born into has a huge imprint on our temperament and outlook, whether we realize it or not.<br /><br />Chapter seven, \\"The Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes,\\" introduces a very interesting theory on cultures and their \\"Power-Distance Indexes.\\" (America is the lowest Power-Distance culture, which explains in part our straight-forward communication and problem-solving patterns.) Chapter eight, \\"Rice Paddies and Math Tests,\\" argues convincingly that people who work hard year round in meaningful labor, have a far greater likelihood of success than slouches who take the summer off. The chapter also explains from a purely linguistic standpoint, why Cantonese-speakers find math easier and more fun than English-speakers do. Chapter nine, \\"Marita's Bargain,: points to some solutions for leveling the field of opportunity and producing higher percentages of outliers.<br /><br />Every time I read a Malcolm Gladwell book, I feel better informed and better equipped to understand and interface with the world.

B0011NVC9I|5.0|When I heard Angelina Jolie was playing Grendel's mother, I gave up on this \\"Beowulf.\\"  Then yesterday, I noticed the Red Box machine (this is a rental DVD vending machine usually found at supermarkets in the U.S.) had it for rent; at $1, I figured what the heck, and brought a copy home.  We watched it.  Okay, I was wrong.  The movie is one of the better film versions of \\"Beowulf.\\"  So good in fact, I put it on my wishlist this morning.<br /><br />I didn't see \\"Polar Express\\" so I had no preconceived notions about the look of the picture.  My impression on the whole was good, I only noticed the CGI once or twice and wasn't particularly bothered (after decades of seeing massive anachronism in Hollywood products, I may be a little hardened).<br /><br />I'd also suggest \\"Grendel\\" by John Gardner and J.R.R. Tolkien's essay on \\"Beowulf.\\"  Gardner looks at the story from the monster's point of view and Tolkien shows he had a life away from elves and hobbits.
031606792X|2.0|Of all four books in the series, this ranks above the second book but definitely isn't my favorite. This one actually tells the story from multiple points of views, not only Bella's, and we get a glimpse from Jacob's side of the story for a part of it. However, this book is distressingly romantically sappy and the story gets rather convoluted beginning from Bella's new \\"condition\\". For fans of Meyer, I'd recommended [[ASIN:0316068047 The Host: A Novel]]. Twilight is a nice series, but overrated, and this book doesn't even live up to the first book's standard. The ending is probably the better part of the book.

While I'm not very familiar with this musical, I thought, \\"Just the cast makes me wanna see it.\\" Long story short I finally saw it on DVD and pretended to be disgusted by the blood because my mom would've been horrified if I'd told her I liked it. I really loved the movie, especially the final scenes. I won't give it away. You'll be glued to your chair watching this well-executed tale of a man seeking revenge after years in prison on a false charge (\\"The Count Of Monte Cristo,\\" anyone?). I admit, I was surprised that Johnny Depp, Helena Bonham-Carter (sorely underrated; see her magnificent performance in the classic \\"Mary Shelly's Frankenstein\\"), Timothy Spall & Sacha Baron Cohen (aka \\"Borat\\") could sing. This wonderful movie shouldn't have been rated R. Should've also gotten nominations for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Score and Best Cinematography. Rated PG-13 for some violence.
B0014DZ2VO|5.0|I won't describe here this movie many flaws, as other reviewers already did in length. But despite all of them, I enjoyed the movie tremendously. I believe this is mainly due to Daniel Craig mesmerizing presence and acting. As in Casino Royale he maintains the perfect balance of rough, cruel power, together with surprising sensitivity and softness. The action scenes are thrilling, and the creators of the rebooted series succeed again to keep the movie fresh and in par with the most updated new hi-speed action movies out there. At the same time, there are still many hidden gems and small gestures to be enjoyed by die-hard legacy Bond lovers, although admittedly less than in previous movies. It so happens that I just recently read Fleming's original Casino Royale, and the movie contains a complete word-by-word quote from that book - see if you can find it ! (hint: it relates to one of the most famous Bond icons). Overall, great movie, even if not perfect. It is not better than it's masterpiece predecessor, but still a great Bond movie never the less.
B00003CX8V|5.0|Very, very good and a bit sad.  And most frighteningly there is a scene early on in the movie that shows show Jack Lemmon working in an insurance company in a sea of desk.  I would say \\"pre-cubicle days\\" but it was nearly duplicated at an insurance company in New York in real life around 1989.  Had I seen the movie beforehand I would not have been able to work there without giggleing every time I entered that gigantic room.    Fred MacMurray was wonderful, and in this movie I can really see what people saw in Shirley MacLaine.  And it really started me off on watching more movies by Billy Wilder.  Which are adult films in the right sense of the word.  If you are 16, the odds really are that you are just going to \\"get it\\".  There are things to laugh at, but the horror aspect of it all might not be apparent.    The black and white film will put people off, but it suits it.  It was the last black and white film to win \\"Best Picture\\" (at least I think so) and it deserved it.
0385340990|5.0|I limit five star reviews to books I rearrange my life around. Such was the case with \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Pie Society.\\" I kept pushing back my schedule to read further into it; I almost skipped out on Thanksgiving dinner until logic got me back on track. This is one of those books you want to savor and not rush through because it is a rare treat, but you just can't help yourself either.<br /><br />I can't put my finger on what I liked about this one so much. It isn't the most original idea; in fact it bears a certain resemblance to those quirky British comedies about outsiders from the city being won over by the charms of country life. The lead character, Juliet, didn't seem entirely British to me; she could just as well have been an American character. And it's all a little too perfect, as these books always are. And, yet, I thoroughly enjoyed it, including some very creative twists towards the end.<br /><br />This is going on the list of favorite books of the year.
B0015RWCVM|5.0|Well, Abbado latest wandering in Mozart music (these 5 symphonies, violin concertos, The Magic Flute) brings a lot of new and fresh wind into interpretation of Mozart. If I have to make simplification then Abbados's Mozart is 1. very well articulated and 2. dramatic, fully-blooded music. Here in the symphonies he missed something from the lightness and playfulness of period instrument interpretation like this one form Pinnock, but he supplied it with great sound (also thanks to recoding engineers) and with beautiful palette sound color. Abbado interpretation of Jupiter symphony in this recording is one of the best I've ever heard. I also very like Mozart \\"Prague\\" symphony (38) and opposite to reviewer Osvaldo I need to have repeats in the first movement in place. Here you get all of them, so the first movement takes over 17 min! and the whole symphony is then even longer than Jupiter. This is rarity for sure! But if you do not listen this music to make quick fulfillment of your musical needs but want to really indulge and \\"swim\\" in music, here you can get \\"drink deep\\" :)) So just be careful not to choke! :-) ... so if you are open to broader your view how Mozart can sound and be interpreted, do not hesitate and buy this great recording now!
B000005RY7|4.0|This is a album that was not released in the US but as some good songs & some new ones. But I'm bias I have a  KISS fan as long as I can remember.
B0016K40KY|5.0|A great movie. One of the all time best. We all know that! Even all the Ebert wannabees that clog these pgs know that.    This 'Collector's Ed' has the intermission 20 mins into the second disc! I realize there are tech reasons for this. I think so anyway. It's still a pain. If only the intermission was at the end of the first disc. Perhaps in the near future they can put the whole movie onto one disc. Transfer is pretty good to my non-techie eyes.
B000V8I2QU|5.0|This album sounds great.  Songs are of all styles: fast/slow, hard/soft.  None of them is to skip, and Bruce's voice still work its magic, hence the title!
0375842209|4.0|This is an unusual book. The sentence structure, the frequent bold print announcements, and the copious German language profanity were quite unexpected. The early chapters were a bit slow, and the perspective was so strange that it took me a while to get used to it. This novel did not hold my attention unfailingly, but in the end I was glad that I read the whole thing. It is a wonderful and worthwhile story.<br /><br />I became fond of Liesel, papa and Rudy. They are fully believable, fully human characters. The author writes that they were the first characters he actually missed when the writing was done. I certainly miss them since I finished the story. Their love for each other was a wonderful thing to experience. The feelings between Liesel and Max were especially poignant. Zusak describes them in a realistic and heart wrenching way.<br /><br />The choice of death as the narrator gave the book a unique flavor. While sergeant death is actually quite morbid at times, he or she is a sympathetic and understanding observer of human nature. In the early chapters I found this narrator to be a little too judgmental. I thought that some characters were typecast before I had a chance to know them. However, as the book progresses, these characters are revealed in more complex and  realistic fashion. Zusak is a capable writer.
B001KWN5CW|1.0|The Doors and Warner Music Group issued a press release to promote this CD, stating: \\"Restored and carefully mastered from first generation tapes acquired by Elektra Records and The Doors 40 years ago, these historic shows never sounded better.\\"     However, at least 4 tracks here were sourced from 3rd generation or higher bootlegs. The remaining songs were mastered from an edited 2nd generation 1/4\\" reel to reel copy of a cassette dub made from the master reels.     Neither the Doors, nor their corporate record label Warner Music Group (aka the Rhino and Elektra imprints) own the original master recordings.     The master tapes are owned by Peter Abram, who had the foresight to record the band at The Matrix (with the band's permission)--more than two years before Elektra and Paul Rothchild got around to recording The Doors in a live setting at The Aquarius theater in 1969.     These legendary 1967 live tapes were well engineered by the young Abram and find the rock band at the peak of their prowess as an improvisatory unit.     However, the tapes Warner Music Group has published on this 2 CD rip off are vastly inferior to the master tapes, brief samples of which are circulating on the Internet with Peter's permission for comparison purposes.     Some fans may choose to believe that Abram is being greedy by asking for cash for his tapes. However, The Doors manager Jeff Jampool has publicly stated the Doors' policy about acquiring live tapes is that they will only provide a small royalty based on sales.     According to Abram, he wasn't even approached to sell his tapes to the Doors for this release. And what about all those bootlegs on the market? According to Abram, all bootlegs derive from the missing first generation cassette copies in the Doors archive, which vanished in the 1970s.     The fans get a sonically subpar, incomplete product. The legality of this release is suspect since Peter owns the master tapes. Peter Abram receives zero money from this product,even though he owns the master sound recording. Meanwhile, your purchase of this material will make Warner Music Group and The Doors a little bit wealthier.     And this is the same rock band that recently sued itself for $5 million dollars over issues of \\"integrity?\\"     By the way, how much money was cover designer Stanley Mouse paid for his Matrix album cover art, while they guy that actually recorded the show--on his own nickel and made this cash cow possible for The Doors--doesn't even receive a credit as recording engineer in the liner notes?
0061544493|3.0|Waste of money. I love Victoria's style and thought this book would be about how to realistically acquire classic looks on a \\"normal\\" person's budget, and it's really about Victoria's amazing designer clothing and shoe collection. I enjoyed looking at the pictures, but I would have been better off going to the local book store during my work break and reading it there. There's just so little substance here and the book is awfully  impractical.
B001ED7C58|5.0|It's the perfect price, it comes with a poster of a character, I couldn't be happier with the speedy delivery! Just fantastic!
0780626966|5.0|I would just like to say that this collection is the best. It includes all the movies plus more. It has a booklet with great pictures and commentary. There are also a lot of documentary and special features on the disc. It's great for any Krueger Fan!
B001LRG744|4.0|This 10th episode had a few surprises to the casual viewer of Smallville. One good thing was that Clark and Lana finally closed the door on their relationship and Lois and Clark \\"almost\\" kissed.  I never liked the \\"Doomsday\\" character because in the comics he's the one that killed Superman.  The ending of this one leaves a lot un-resolved and we have to wait at least 2 weeks to see the next one due to the Thanksgiving holiday. Smallville remains one of my favorite shows of all times, though. I hope they have yet another season after this one and then go on to make some major motion pictures with all of these fabulous actors.
B001M6KTLG|1.0|Really, really bad...and, just forget that the story is non-existent and is essentially a two-hour chase without end or meaning. No Nazis ths time. It's 1954 so the enemies are Russians. But, get this, our perennial good samaritan Harrison Ford actually climbs inside an abandoned refrigerator! A children's movie for God's sake!--and, Harrison Ford climbs inside an abandoned refrigerator! Oh, btw, the purpose was to protect himself from a nuclear blast. Jeez...need I say more?

B001C46P2A|5.0|You often hear people lament that \\"they just don't make them like they used to.\\"  Baz Luhrmann proves those people wrong.<br /><br />In the early days of World War II, Sarah, Lady Maitland Ashley (Nichole Kidman), has flown from England to Australia to track down her husband, whom she assumes is philandering on his hobby ranch a continent away from his duties and responsibilities.  Ignoring repeated cablegrams from Lord Ashley warning her not to come; Lady Ashley arrives in Darwin expecting to be met by Lord Ashley's representative, the Drover (Hugh Jackman).  When she does not find her expected escort at the gate, Lady Ashley strides into town only to find her husband's \\"trusted man\\" engaged in a stupendous bar fight that has spilled into the street.  Despite this inauspicious introduction, she manages to overcome her distaste for the Drover in her determination to press on and reach the cattle station.<br /><br />Lady Ashley intends to sell off the ranch and bring her husband home.  However, her plans change when she finally arrives at the station to find she has been just made a widow.  The foreman, Neil Fletcher (David Wenham), offers to broker a deal for the Ashley's land and stock with the local cattle baron, King Carney, and take her back to Darwin so she can catch the next plane back to England.<br /><br />Nullah (Brandon Walters), a half Aborigine child who lives at the ranch, lets her know that the best of her unbranded cattle have been driven across the river and merged into King Carney's herd.  When Sarah mentions this to Fletcher, he almost persuades her that the child is mistaken.  But when she sees him raise his hand and threaten the boy she strikes Fletcher with her riding crop and fires him on the spot.<br /><br />Lady Ashley must now bring 1500 head of cattle to Darwin in order to secure a contract to supply beef to the Australian military.  If she fails she faces utter ruin.<br /><br />\\"Australia\\" has a cattle drive, complete with stampede; an innocent man falsely accused of murder; a lovely, aristocratic heroine and a rugged, handsome hero who, while they initially dislike each other, eventually fall in love; a kid who seems artlessly adorable; a magic man; and an extremely hissable villain who plots against them at every turn.  If our cast of characters hasn't endured enough already, there is the Japanese bombing of Darwin.<br /><br />This is a film that will appeal to a wide range of audiences.  It has a coherent plot, solid acting, and the overall cinematography is breathtaking despite some awkward CGI moments and several shots lifted directly from \\"Tora, Tora, Tora\\" reused for the Darwin sequence.  Although \\"Australia\\" is 165 minutes long, it is never tedious.<br /><br />Highly recommended to anyone who yearns for a return to the days of sweeping, romantic epics.f murder; a lovely, aristocratic heroine and a rugged, handsome hero who, while they initially dislike each other, eventually fall in love; a kid who seems artlessly adorable; a magic man; and an extremely hissable villain who plots against them at every turn.

B000005IS1|5.0|This music is a snapshot in time of an era gone by.  The raw energy of the MC5 inspired Detroit musicians and others to \\"Kick out the Jams\\" with their music. I was amazed to find this \\"live\\" recording still available.  I haven't heard or even thought about the MC5 in the past 35 years.  So on the 40th anniversary of this album, I listened to it and a flood of memories came back to me as I revisited the MC5 live at the Grande Ballroom in Detroit.  This album captures the essence of being back at the Grande. At the time this album was recorded, the MC5 was the most exciting high energy rock band around.  For those who remember the counter culture of the 60's, this music epitomizes the frustration of the youth: anti war, anti draft, anti establishment, radical politics, radical lifestyles, turn on, tune in, drop out, etc.  The album cut \\"Motor City's Burning\\" about sums this up. I would recommend this album to anyone interested in rock music history and music of the 60's counter culture. Who knows, it may inspire you to \\"kick out the jams\\" in your own way.
B0013ND30M|5.0|This was my favorite movie when I was a little girl because the princess's name is the same as mine. =-)  I also enjoyed the tour through the castle.  I'd forgotten all about that and it brought back some wonderful childhood memories. \\"Meh\\" for the rest of the extras but the movie is gorgeous and the artwork still holds up today.
1878424602|5.0|A must read. A short concise, yet profound inspirational reading. I found in it a summary of my believes and a practical guide to success. I have already bought more than a dozen copies that I have given to family, friends and those in need of hope. Specially good for those not so fond of reading, because they can do it very quickly while learning a great deal. Thanks Deepak!
0385340990|3.0|I had read the previous reviews on this book and could not wait to sit and read a heart warming book . It was just ok to me . A  good book is one that i feel you cant wait to read everyday , i did not feel that way about this one . I read it because i started it and i thought  that based on the reviews it would get better. I did find the general idea interesting, about what was going on with the germans etc .. i just thought the letters got to me a bit to much and a little boring
B0014I4KIK|5.0|Off the cusp of the Amy Winehouse sound, we're now treated to an immensely talented and soulful singer by the name of Duffy. She has one of those familiar faces that you think you know and one of those voices that you haven't heard for decades, unless you break out your old album collection of course. She flew into the UK charts with her debut single \\"Mercy\\" the backing music was nostalgic and the voice unique. Many compared the woman to Ms. Winehouse, but I would certainly put Duffy in a category of her own easily comparing her to the Etta James' of the world.<br /><br />What annoys me in a way is, she's so talented, I mean that with true sincerity but it upsets me that she has now resorted to the robbing tactics of releasing a \\"Special\\" edition version of the album with about 6 new songs, one to be a single. It seems to be the trend of the music companies now as a way of milking as much money from the fans as possible. I would honestly advise that if you haven't bought the regular album already then wait for the special edition. The extra songs are worth the cash, I just don't think it's right that people should be forced to buy the original album and then should have to fork out again for the special edition.<br /><br />Top 3 songs are the current singles<br /><br />1. Mercy<br />2. Rain On Your Parade<br />3. Warwick Avenue.<br /><br />Buy it and love it (The special edition I mean.)
031606792X|5.0|WARNING:  to anyone who has read some of the books, or is just contemplating getting started, if you are seriously planning to read the series, DON'T READ the reviews on Amazon.  They will tell you the plot and ruin the story and any possible surprises.    Have NONE of you IDIOTS read any of the guidelines for posting reviews?  Or you do you just not care that you ruin the plot for anyone else because you are giving it a bad review?  You are not supposed to reveal everything that is in the book!!!!    I am in the middle of Eclipse, and so far have loved the books--though New Moon tore my heart out in the beginning.  I went to the Twilight movie a week ago and loved it, bought the first two books that day, and borrowed the third. I was on Amazon buying something else, and checking for the last book, curious about the lower ratings for it, I scrolled down to some reviews which appear to give away the ENTIRE PLOT and any surprises I might have had!  I only scanned through and quit reading when I realized what was there.    A person could give a review in general terms, such as citing character inconsistencies, unbelievable plot, etc., without ruining things for those who haven't read the book yet.
B00003CXDB|5.0|It's hard to find a really good Charlie Sheen movie but this one is for sure!    The scenario is great because it is something that can happen to anyone.  Its particularly prevalent in today's environment because we apparently have ALOT of people just like Bud Fox.  A young man finds that in order to get what he wants out of life he has to bend the rules.  Then, in true fashion, BIG BROTHER takes him down so that they can turn him on the big fish, Gordon Gekko.  I have seen this happen a dozen times in life.    Daryl Hannah, Michael Douglas & Martin Sheen all round out this allstar cast.  Put it in your collection.
1558908382|3.0|Plot-wise, 'Grosse Pointe Blank' is about professional hit man Martin Q. Blank (John Cusack) going back to Grosse Pointe for his 10-year High School Reunion. His psychiatrist Dr. Oatman (Alan Arkin) refuses to treat him because he is afraid of him, but he persists in calling him, and uses him for a reluctant sounding board for his own ideas about his therapy:<br /><br />---------------------------<br />[Talking to his psychiatrist about going to his high school reunion]<br />Marty: They all have husbands and wives and children and houses and dogs, and, you know, they've all made themselves a part of something and they can talk about what they do. What am I gonna say? \\"I killed the president of Paraguay with a fork. How've you been?\\"<br />=================================================<br /><br />The real reason he is going to the reunion is actually so he can reconnect with his High School sweetheart, Debi (Minnie Driver):<br /><br />----------------------<br />Debi: Okay. So. You're back... a decade late, and... you're on some sort of therapeutic assignment, and you want to sort things out with me. So the question now becomes, do I allow you access to me or... do I call security?<br />Marty: I don't think that'd be a good idea.<br />=======================================<br /><br />Miss Driver is cute and appealing, and she is especially good with quips. Not only do they meet cute, the cuteness continues non-stop, a veritable cavalcade of cuteness:<br /><br />--------------------------------------------<br />Debi: So, is there a Mrs. Mysterio?<br />Martin Q. Blank: No, but I do have a very nice cat?<br />Debi: Not the same.<br />Martin Q. Blank: Well, you don't know my cat, it's very demanding.<br />Debi: It? You don't know if it's a boy or girl?<br />Martin Q. Blank: I respect its privacy.<br />====================================================================<br /><br />Enough already, with the cutie cute cuteness. How about some substance, some epiphany, some revelation:<br /><br />---------------------<br />Debi: You know what you need?<br />Marty: What?<br />Debi: Shakabuku.<br />Marty: You wanna tell me what that means?<br />Debi: It's a swift, spiritual kick to the head that alters your reality forever.<br />Marty: Oh, that'd be good. I think.<br />===========================================<br /><br />It is kind of a dark comedy, with the juxtaposition of killing for a living with a High School reunion scenario. It is kind of a romantic comedy, with the screw ball reason that the two crazy kids can't be together the fact that he is a professional hitman. Neither of these two kinds of comedies really work for me here. I think that the people who want to see John Cusack are not the same demographic who want to see lots of shooting and things blowing up. The people who want to see that aren't the ones who want to see romantic comedies, not even dark comedies. And they certainly aren't interested in a lot of clever dialogue. And the people who do want to hear clever dialogue don't want to watch a lot of people being shot and see things blowing up.<br /><br />Maybe John Cusack wanted to make a film like this to see how it feels to be an action hero. Maybe he thought it would pull in fans of different genres. 'Grosse Pointe Blank' isn't a bad movie, and it is quite entertaining, but it just doesn't quite cut it for me. As Bob said at the High School reunion, \\"I'm drawing a complete....Blank.\\"<br /><br />Anyway, Debi is a DJ, which gives the filmmakers an opportunity to shower us with soundtrack cuts galore. It is like they just wanted to pay homage to the 80's, and how much better the music was than during the 90's. This is actually the best part of the movie. Joe Strummer wrote some music for the soundtrack, and there is also a lot of The Clash and other great music from the 80's:<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00004YLBC Violent Femmes]]<br />\\"Blister in the Sun\\"<br />Written by Gordon Gano<br />Performed by Violent Femmes<br />Courtesy of Slash/London Records, Ltd.<br />By Arrangement with PolyGram Film & TV Licensing<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00004C4L1 Super Black Market Clash]]<br />\\"Armagideon Time\\"<br />Written by Clement Dodd and Willie Williams<br />Performed by The Clash<br />Courtesy of Epic Records<br />By Arrangement with Sony Music Licensing<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00005GTH3 Live & Let Die]]<br />\\"Live and Let Die\\"<br />Written by Paul McCartney & Linda McCartney<br />Performed by Guns N' Roses<br />Courtesy of Geffen Records<br />By Arrangement with MCA Special Markets & Products<br />(\\"Live and Let Die\\" segues into a 'muzak' version performed by Adam Fields)<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00007CVRE The Jam - The Complete Jam]]<br />\\"Absolute Beginners\\"<br />Written by Paul Weller<br />Performed by The Jam<br />Courtesy of Polydor Limited<br />By Arrangement with PolyGram Film & TV Licensing<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000026MBK Today's Specials]]<br />\\"Pressure Drop\\"<br />Written by Toots Hibbert (as Frederick Hibbert)<br />Performed by The Specials<br />Courtesy of Kuff Records Ltd./Virgin Records America, Inc.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000BPK2G6 Ace of Spades]]<br />\\"Ace of Spades\\"<br />Written by Lemmy (as Ian Kilmister), Fast Eddie Clarke (as Edward Clarke) and Phil 'Philthy Animal' Taylor (as Philip Taylor)<br />Performed by Mot&ouml;rhead<br />Courtesy of Castle Copyrights, Ltd.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000GGSM76 The Head on the Door]]<br />\\"In Between Days\\"<br />Written by Robert Smith<br />Performed by The Cure<br />Courtesy of Elektra Entertainment Corp.<br />By Arrangement with Warner Special Products; and Courtesy of Fiction Records/Polydor Ltd./Elektra Entertainment Ltd.<br />By Arrangement with PolyGram Film & TV Licensing<br /><br />[[ASIN:B0000057BD Introduce Yourself]]<br />\\"We Care a Lot\\"<br />Written by Chuck Mosely, Roddy Bottum, Billy Gould (as William Gould),<br />Mike Bordin and Jim Martin<br />Performed by Faith No More<br />Courtesy of Slash/London Records, Ltd.<br />By Arrangement with PolyGram Film & TV Licensing<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00000338D Message From Beat Street: Best Of]]<br />\\"White Lines\\"<br />Written by Sylvia Robinson and Melle Mel (as Melvin Glover)<br />Performed by Melle Mel (as Grandmaster Melle Mel)<br />Courtesy of Rhino Records/Castle Copyrights Ltd.<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000000OAE Hot Space]]<br />\\"Under Pressure\\"<br />Written by David Bowie, Freddie Mercury, Roger Taylor, John Deacon and Brian May<br />Performed by David Bowie (with Queen)<br />Courtesy of Raincloud Productions Ltd./David R.

B0016PM722|5.0|This is a really cool thing to own if you're a big Star Wars fan.  I got it in the mail a few days ago and have been having fun with it since.<br /><br />The metal hilt is very durable and well constructed.  It's not an exact movie replica, the hilt is a little bigger than the ones they used in the movies because of all the electronics they had to stuff in there.  But it's not overly huge or anything, like those cheap $15 you can buy at any toy store.<br /><br />The blade is just awesome.  The bright blue shines and glows even in well lit environments.  But when you turn off all the lights and turn it on, it just looks really cool the way it glows in the dark.  I thought it was also cool how when you turn it on or off, you can see the glow of the blade expanding and retracting as if it was a \\"real\\" lightsaber.<br /><br />Now as someone else said, this isn't really the type of toy you just want to go around swinging madly and stage your own Anakin VS Obi-Wan fights (even though it will make a clashing noise when the blade is tapped).  That's not to say it's not durable, because it is very well constructed, but I just don't think it would be wise to go bashing the blade into stuff.<br /><br />It sounds really awesome too, just like in the movies.  And the batteries (it takes 3 AA batteries [not included]) are quick and easy to install, you don't even need a screwdriver or anything.<br /><br />I really see this as more of a collector's item (it even comes with a stand to proudly display it), something to show off to your friends, or maybe as a really good costume piece for halloween.  I'm a bit of a sword collector myself, so I kind of see this as a nice addition to my collection.<br /><br />If you've ever wanted to know what it feels like to hold the power of a lightsaber in your hand, this is probably the closest thing you're ever gonna get.

Unlike the WWI and WWII war books which read like ancient history this one hits close to home as most of the events transpired within the last decade.  The author does a great job of telling his story from a boys point of view with imagery that will give you nightmares.<br /><br />If you cannot handle reading about graphic violence, rape, murder, wartime atrocities, then do not buy this book.  Otherwise it is a good companion to the Blood Diamond movie which covers some of the same material.
B00003CWL6|3.0|This is a good film and and I would like it except for two things: The title and the fact there was nothing to feel good about in watching this film--it was depressing.  It is a not-so-subtle attack on middle class American values and institutions.  Targets are the American Military, Marriage, gun ownership, corporate America/capitalism, consumerism, traditional morals and sexual mores etc....The only thing the writers left out was religion--none of the cast of dysfunctional people were church going christians.  I am sure this was a oversight.  The title was off putting because it suggests that Americans have empty, dysfunctional, meaningless lives. This film is a left-wing diatribe with a social agenda to bash american society using many liberal cliches and unlikable, one-dimensional characters.  Maybe I read too much into it.      The only semi normal, healthy people were the two gay neighbors; everyone else is a mess.  Of course, the worst writing came with the new family next door with the father being a Marine Colonel.  He was portrayed as a domineering man incapable of expressing his feelings and love for his family.  He imposed harsh discipline and physical abuse for even minor infractions.  Of course he had a large gun collection and Nazi memorabilia.  His disdain for his gay neighbors is on complete display and of course we find out that this disdain is only there to hide his own latent homosexuality.  How tiresome!  The realtor/wife of the main character builds confidence and feels \\"powerful\\" by learning to shoot a gun.  The only semi-likable character is Kevin Spacey's who is a guy in a mid-life crises brought on by his own sexual frustration and infatuation with---the friend of his daughter.  He quits his job, and tells off those corporate creeps.  He black mails them into a year's salary.  We are supposed to feel okay about that because they deserve it.  Then he pursues and seduces his daughters best friend.  In the process he buys the car he wanted asa teenager, starts smoking pot again and listens to rock music.  The only redemption for him comes at the end when he doesn't go through with the little affair he had been planning--but he comes awful close.  The message of this film is: don't be uptight-express your feelings, smoke pot and have sex.   Sounds a bit like turn on, tune in and drop out.  A classic film for 60's rejects.    The artistry in this film comes in the way it is told on the screen.  It moves along at a nice pace and keeps you off-balance and guessing.  There are a few poetic scenes when the neighbor boy and son of the marine talks about his desire to film and his contemplation of beauty, which gives the film its title.  I don't care to see it again.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|I am a woman who likes her action movies, and this one does not disappoint. Amazing effects, incredible stuntwork, and the casting is perfect! Three of my favorites(McAvoy, Morgan, and Jolie)in one movie, pure enjoyment. Highly recommended for those who are looking for a butt-kicking escape.

045122499X|5.0|A good follow-up to \\"Pillars of the Earth\\".    Very suspenseful story,  Really enjoyed this book.
B00188M5TM|4.0|\\"Changeling\\" is a gripping and at times deeply uncomfortable film that will grab your attention throughout most of its two hours & twenty minutes, which is some commendation on its own. And, it's a genuinely true story - a rare claim for a film to make but one that's fundamental to its power in keeping you glued to the screen.    But is it? Well there's little doubt that most of the key facts presented in the film are true and, if you've seen it, check out the more reliable internet articles covering the case's source material to confirm this (and, if you haven't, don't read them or the rest of this review until afterwards unless you want to spoil the full impact of the film).    So, where's the problem? Well, a key premise of \\"Changeling\\" is that the Los Angeles Police Department, a deeply corrupt organisation at the time, used and then abused a missing boy's mother, Christine Collins, for their own ends. And, beneath this there's a pretty overt implication that the imposition on her of a conveniently available \\"look alike\\" for her missing son was, from the outset, a cynical set-up by the LAPD simply to gain positive publicity. All of which may be a perfectly true interpretation of events.    Or maybe not... for the source information on the case reveals some important elements relating to it that the film omits or glosses over but which could change your view on what actually went on here. First off, it omits the fact that Walter Collins' disappearance was widely reported in the press, including photographs of him and repeated claims by his mother that he'd been kidnapped. Next, it glosses over the background of the boy who pretended to be him: someone who subsequently appears never to have changed his story that he knew of the \\"kidnapping\\" and that, after he'd been told how much he looked like the photos of the boy in the papers, decided on his own volition to impersonate him as a way of getting to Hollywood to meet his favourite movie star. Then, it omits some key facts concerning the imposter: for example, the fact that prior to meeting him Christine Collins had, from photographs, positively identified him to the police as being her son; that he was emaciated because of his poor background; that he was unusually convincing in the role, claiming that he'd been kidnapped & interned and that in addition to losing weight because of this he'd lost some of his memory after being hit on the head by his abductors; and that, because of his emaciated state, his facial similarity and his skill in lying, he convinced a number of people who'd known Walter Collins that he was genuine. None of which comes out in the film.    It is, of course, quite possible that the LAPD did indeed set-up the whole thing; but, it's also quite possible that, presented with someone who looked like the missing boy, who span a convincing story about his disappearance & condition, and who others believed to be him, the police genuinely thought they'd got the right person. And, if so, it's also possible that they had some basis, at least initially, for believing that Christine Collins' refusal to accept him as her real son was a result of his emaciation and her traumatised state. Maybe not, but this missing information does suggest that there's more than one interpretation of the reasons behind this quite bizarre sequence of events.    All very odd, particularly as the inclusion of this information would have made the film much more believable. For example, why cast the imposter as a healthy, almost chubby child when his emaciation was a key reason why he could successfully impersonate Walter Collins to both the police and others who'd known him? And, why not show Christine Collins identifying him as her son from photos when, without this, you're left with the obvious question of why didn't the police or indeed anyone else compare photos of the two boys? Maybe its inclusion might make you question whether the LAPD was quite as bad as it's portrayed to be throughout the film, thereby robbing it of some of its undoubted impact, but then again, there's enough genuinely horrific and genuinely true facts in it - including Christine Collins' short internment by the police in a mental institution and it's highly accurate recounting of the whole story of Gordon Northrop and the \\"chicken coop\\" murders - to make it a sufficiently powerful and shocking film on its own.    Whatever the reasons for these fairly fundamental omissions the end result is that \\"Changeling\\" is not actually what it claims to be: it's not a genuinely \\"true\\" story, rather a powerfully effective dramatisation of one of several possible interpretations of what happened that relies on your belief that it's genuine for it to work. Which, possibly very cleverly, is a bit like it's subject matter... something that's highly effective at convincing you that it's something that it's not.
B0014G5LG2|4.0|Some of the previous versions I've heard of Mahler's tenth symphony have seemed sketchy, a bit disconnected and wandering.<br />The very young (for a conductor) Daniel Harding has brought it all together and kept the music flowing and alive.<br />In a few places I'd have preferred to have a bigger sound. For example, the muted drum sounds are just that--MUTED. Well of course the score calls for muted drums. It's just that these are very much softer than many of us are accustomed to hearing.<br /><br />The Purgatorio movement is its usual \\"spooky\\" self, but the movement seems to flow more fluidly--more like a devils' dance--a sort of Berlioz witches' sabbath atmosphere.<br /><br />Whether this will eventually be considered among the very best versions of Mahler's tenth remains to be seen, but it certainly gave me a new perspective on how vigorous Mahler was even during the last months of his too-short life.  It is brilliantly written, well-performed here, and demonstrates how full of life Mahler still was in the final year of his life.
0375826726|4.0|Considering the size of this book, not all that much happens in it.  Seems like the author really went out of his way to stretch this into two books.  All that happens in this book could easily have been told in 150-200 pages and it would have been much more exciting to read even if it would have been relatively short.  The author is a good writer, but if continues on this trail I won't be reading future books of his after the end of this series.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Though ashamedly I have not read the book, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. It was just beautiful ! :) What woman wouldn't want a Mr. Rochester of her own. *sigh* &lt;3 For anyone who enjoys period dramas, this is a must see!<br /><br />I like to watch movies with subtitles on, especially if it's an English movie in case I can't understand a word or two because of pronunciation... and this DVD, like BBC's Pride and Prejudice, does not have subtitles, grrr. Wish they'd fix that.
1401302378|5.0|A friend of mine told me about \\"The Long Tail\\" a few months ago and I finally got the book.  Chris Anderson gets it right with the transformation of brick and mortar to online...

B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is an amazing piece of work, and was one of the first \\"created for the web\\" creations to really succeed, both artistically and virally. Neil Patrick and the whole cast are perfect, and the entire production is highly original in content, format, and artistry. The songs are great (you'll be singing them for days, if not weeks) and bottom line, it's just really, really good, and worth watching or buying or whatever!

B001G5ZKZS|4.0|This is an excellent DVD. I have a hard time giving anything Rush does since 1990 5 stars so this earns 4. It is the long sought after answer to what should be in the middle of their Grace Under Pressure DVD and Exit Stage Left..., the only reason is because of the inclusion of songs such as Circumstances, Digital Man, Entre Nous, Between The Wheels, Witch Hunt, Passage to Bangkok, Mission and some stunning camera and video quality here. RIO owns the rights probably forever for the concert that makes you wish you were really there. I mean that show is the standard for how all Rush crowds should act.    Holland like Frankfurt on R30 and the UK for A Show of Hands suffers from sleepy crowd syndrome. This feels more like Rush playing to canned applause which takes the excitement away from it at times. Overall though one can't complain all that much. When they can make One Little Victory worth watching and Malignant Narcissism sound exactly like the record...they score big.    Why they chose to pan so far away during Neil's solo however only leads me to believe it was a combo of both nights on audio and had to do so for the sake to sync with video.    This is a must own for any Rush fan whether you like Snakes and Arrows or not. To me personally they played 4 songs too many from the record and could have swapped those out with Jacobs Ladder, Time Stand Still, Show Don't Tell, and Test For Echo by giving us some classics from the band that we do not have on dvd yet live by the band.
0823015033|5.0|This is the best sculpture instruction book on the market.  Don't buy any others all you need is theis one.  The book starts out with instructions on how to make tools to assist in your sculpture journey.  The instructions are clear and easy to follow.  Ms. Dewey even adds information on how to use the tools.  Then on to the sculpture itself.  All the information is included starting with how to make a foil base to how to measure out the amount of clay to use.  Ms. Dewey takes a daunting subject and breaks it down so that anyone can have success.  I can hardly wait to get to my studio to work now that I have this book as a teacher resouce and guide.
1582701709|1.0|Sorry - my review is simplistic and not intended to enlighten anyone who might be interested in reading the book. Frankly, I found it to be nothing short of rubbish and not worthy of my time. It offered me nothing. To those who found the book of value, good on ya! Perhaps I missed the point. Cheers.
B00005JKEC|4.0|I can say that the film has no flaws. Also Ethan Hawke's characters is not subdued, in fact, Hawke's character (Jake Hoyt) while being sensitive and moral, is at the same intense level as Denzel Washington's.    You can't write a review, without describing the plot.    The story is very real and vivid. It concerns a rookie cop named  Jake Hoyt (Hawke) who is assigned to a veteran narcotics cop named Alonzo Harris (Denzel Washington).    During hia first few days on the job. Hoyr observes how Harris does his job of busting crooks and drug dealers. Alonzo is like a Dirty Harry movie, everyone in the city knows who he is and is scared to death of the gritty cop.    However, underneath, that great cop lies a crooked, corrupt policeman who is playing both sides of the law.... This is Denzel Washington best role ever, and he won the Oscar over Russell Crowe for best actor and it was well deserved.    Denzel through Alonzo creates another memorable corrupt villain  in film history.    Ethan Hawke is also great as Jake Hoyt. In fact both actors were nominated for their roles in the movie.    I just checked out the DVD, and it's absolutely fantastic!!!    The alternate ending is actually almost identical to the original ending, the making of features are great though along  with the candid commentary by Antoine Fuqua.    It was the movie of the year in 2001 and still holds up as corrupt law enforcement is still alive today.
B001DHXT20|5.0|I gave the other Hulk movie 1 star. This gets 5. It was better in every way possible. From the story to the special effects to the actors. I really loved Liv Tyler as Betty Ross. I thought she was a major improvement over Jennifer Connelly. This actually felt like a Hulk movie. The other one was crap. And the ending to this movie is priceless. Can't wait to see what is to come.

B001DHXT2A|3.0|This movie is a decent revamp of the Hulk series.  By far an improvement from Ang Lee's Hulk.  The action is great and the CG effects are impressive.  The plot is weak and dialogue practically non-existent.  My biggest problem with the movie is that it doesn't  bring the story of Hulk any further along than the last movie did.  It basically starts wit Bruce Banner on the run and then ends with him being on the run again.  Still, the movie is fun and the Tony Stark cameo is cool.
B001E7OO2I|5.0|John Legend's new CD is terrific. The cd is slickly produced and Legend is at his best.
B0007TKNII|4.0|This film is great.  I love the music from Phantom and this movie is a fun version of the play.  Even with it's weaknesses (sound editing is pretty bad and the Phantom's voice isn't perfect) it is a good rendition of the classic musical.
B0001XAPY2|5.0|It is difficult to describe Porco Rosso. It's so different from the rest of Miyazaki's movies. There's no overt environmental theme being rammed down your throat. This is just a great story told well and by a master storyteller. The animation is fantastic, the visuals are superb and this movie has some of the most evicative music I have heard in a long time. This is a must-see movie.
0307269752|4.0|The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo is a terrific murder mystery/corporate intrigue thriller that keeps the reader guessing.  So many novels like this start out strong, for me at least, and then, somewhere in the middle, the ending will become predictable, but not this one.  Larsson had me guessing and surprised at where he took the narrative.  This is an enjoyable read that will not disappoint.  Enjoy!

0060920432|3.0|A good self help book that will help the reader to understand and order consciousness. The reader is taught how to cope with everday challenges and chaos. The book explains that we must not be sad, angry, worried, ect., despite events that occur outside of our control. Rather, we can learn to accept unwanted events and choose to feel happy, productive, or calm despite those obstacles.     And I think the author would agree that, it is illogical to believe that sadness, anger, worry, fear, loneliness and many other emotions MUST be disordered and avoided. Suffering is part of life and cannot/should not be avoided. An emotion need not be wrong or eliminated from consciousness simply because it is unwanted.     Certain injustices that occur in this world cause many of us to experience a lifetime of deep sadness and suffering. And despite the ability we may have to be productive and happy by means of flow experiences, we must understand that unwanted emotions are healthy and very normal. Unwanted emotions such as anger and sadness help us to realize injustice. If we did not experience anger/sadness in the face of injustice, we would cease being human.

0765360969|5.0|This series is phenomenal. I picked this book up when I heard Brandon was taking over for Robert Jordan to see if he would do the Wheel of Time series justice.  After reading this (and the second in the trilogy and his first novel, [[ASIN:0765350378 Elantris]]) I have every confidence he was the correct person for the job.    As has been mention, the magic system is very original and very fun.    His use of jumping POVs as he gets to the climax can be frustrating, but only in the sense that you are so engrossed you wish he would resolve the climax.  It sucks because it keeps me saying to my self, \\"one more page, one more page, ok, one more chapter then I have to get to bed\\".  His books have made for a few blurry eyes at work in the morning :)
B000LVFDOG|5.0|There are many things American companies do that puzzle me, but this has to be one of the top 5: Why would you (as a company) have a show that is so iconic that people who have never SEEN it would still recognize references to it, and NEVER release it to DVD -- even in the year when you attempt to revive the concept franchise by re-making the spinoff \\"Bionic Woman\\"? (I won't even discuss the incomprehensible decisionmaking process that decides to utterly change the entire basis of THAT show...).<br /><br />When I purchased the first season of The Six Million Dollar Man, I expected it to be a purchase purely for nostalgia. In fact, I was braced to end up being UNABLE to watch the show (I've found it hard, for example, to watch MacGyver or Kung Fu, two other nostalgia favorites of mine).<br /><br />To my utter surprise, in some ways this is a BETTER show than I remembered. The writing is tight, often clever, and LESS stereotyped than I was prepared for. (For example, the first major appearance by the Soviet Union's forces is not as adversaries!) Oh, there's stereotyping and events-of-convenience galore, but they're worked into the plots which are less simplistic than many of the follow-on TV action-adventure shows, and overall better acted. (The early movies are not entirely consistent with the series -- besides a change in some actors, the nature of Steve's relationship with Goldman and the OSI undergoes a fairly radical shift; for that reason I am focusing here on the actual TV first season rather than the movies)<br /><br />It's clear that the producers, actors, and writers were still trying to \\"work into\\" the overall concept and try to figure out a way of keeping the action and the characters balanced. The actors -- specifically Lee Majors and Richard Anderson -- make it work. Steve is a man who has, with great difficulty, overcome the shock of becoming part man, part machine, something he had not asked for and not been prepared for, and has come to accept that he's been given a gift that carries terrible responsibility with it as well. Oscar Goldman is a quintessential spymaster who has, through his interaction with Steve, found himself forced to become more human than is, perhaps, encouraged in his field, in order to keep the friendship and loyalty Steve offers.<br /><br />One very nice touch is that Steve Austin's background as an astronaut is, surprisingly, at least as important as his bionic secret for many of his missions. The \\"superstar\\" nature of astronauts, especially in the era of this show, is recognized and used appropriately. Being one of the astronauts who actually walked on the moon makes Steve special in a number of ways, including the ability (in what was a more relaxed era, surprisingly) to sometimes just gain access to locations and the confidence of people who would otherwise be terribly suspicious.<br /><br />The adversarial relationship of the United States and the Soviet Union, as I mentioned, is present, yet is not overblown. Given the era and the setting, it would have been trivially easy and even understandable to demonize them, make the Soviet Union behind almost every plot, providing Steve with ready-made villains to trash. Instead, the worst enemies are invariably rogue organizations -- terrorists, obsessive scientists, conscienceless weapons dealers, spies with their own agendas -- and, often, simple nature and human error.<br /><br />This is a world in which it's assumed that people are, at heart, not only mostly alike, but mostly preferring to get along. It's the exceptions, the men and women who don't CARE about other people at all, who cause most of the trouble in the world, and one man with dedication, a clear vision ...and perhaps some nuclear-powered additions... can often triumph and make the world a better place.<br /><br />The bionics themselves are more carefully worked out than I had expected. While certain limitations are clearly originally intended purely for story-opportunity purposes, they're generally used consistently. Moreover, the classic opening animation can now be stop-framed and examined carefull, as we could never have done in the old broadcast days, revealing that the producers/designers had put a great deal of thought into the bionic capabilities. The numbers don't *quite* add up accurately, but they're not all that far off compared to what a slapdash and handwavy approach to the technology would have produced.<br /><br />In the first season, many of the iconic features are still being \\"worked out\\". Occasionally we see Steve running, not in the classic slow-motion bionic run, but at the actual speed his running would require. These scenes merely reinforce the CORRECTNESS of the decision to make the 60mph running sequences slow-mo; in slow motion, Steve running looks dramatic. At what would be actual 60mph speed, he looks SILLY.<br /><br />Similarly, the classic \\"bionic sound\\" is missing in most of the first season episodes, and in fact is first heard as a sound accompanying a humanoid robot, rather than one from Steve's bionics. It isn't until the second season that the standard sound effects (bionic strength use, \\"bionic jump\\" sound, and bionic eye) came to be regularly used.<br /><br />Overall, this is a surprisingly good series even today. I really wish that  we'd get a USA release of this -- especially for the WHOLE SERIES, as apparently even overseas only seasons 1 and 2 have been released. This means that many of the classic later episodes are STILL unavailable on DVD no matter where you order from.the classic opening animation can now be stop-framed and examined carefull, as we could never have done in the old broadcast days, revealing that the producers/designers had put a great deal of thought into the bionic capabilities.

B00192KCQ0|3.0|This album is a cornucopia of musical ideas.  Many of the riffs sound pleasantly reminiscent of great Metallica albums from the past.  There are, however, moments that sound a bit disconnected.  Something like listening to a Metallica 'best of' collection where the songs themselves are sliced up and rearranged to form new songs.  Sometimes it works well, and sometimes not so much.    The lyrics are mostly unspectacular.  I suppose I have been spoiled by previous Metallica albums.  At times the lyrics and delivery made me think someone let Dave Mustaine back into the band.    Overall, a good album, and definitely worth a listen.

B0015HOFZI|4.0|This is a great product for its price. It works equally well with both  PCs and Macs, i.e. once you download Audacity for the Mac. The Audacity  software allows audio play-thru without using the RCA connections,  thus only the USB connection is required. Sony should provide Mac   compatibility by including Audacity or indicating Mac compatibility  by its use via a free Audacity download.    Other than a couple of minor changes, i.e. RCA jacks in the rear versus  a hardwired cable and an arm clip to hold the cartridge securely, the  unit is well designed. The provided software works well on the PC,  but the Audacity software is preferred. The unit is very easy to setup,  taking only minutes. The controls, start, stop and arm up/down, make  for a simple/easy operation.

Plus, the extra features and picture quality are second to none.  Worth every penny!
B001GQACGO|4.0|It's not her usual stuff. Yet there is growth in her creativity,singing and writing skills. Creativity is not a piece of furniture which once made sits there in the same form as in the time of its origin. It evolves and takes on new directions some familiar some not. I say keep singing your'e getting better. My favorite of all is \\"Single Ladies\\" so much spunk in the delivery...both in the song and in the music video.
0930289234|4.0|Hands down, one of the best graphic novels I've read, right up there with Sandman and Dark Knight Returns. More than just a superhero novel, it goes in depth into the underlying mentality that motivated these people to wear a costume and fight crime, and how that mentality comes back to bite them in the end. I highly recommend this.
B001DTPZNY|3.0|the end of it did much to spoil the the matter. The special effects were brilliant and Harrison Ford did well for a man of his...er stage. Shia LaBoeuf brought a bit of spice to some of the stunts and Cate Blanchett was smashing. The end aside it would have been so much better.

There are spaceships, cars and bikes.<br /><br />You have seen the ships from Star Wars, now imagine the vehicles are 10 times sleeker. That's what you get in this book.<br /><br />Daniel Simon has also include over hundreds of his concept design sketches for his vehicles. Not only that, he has provided interesting back stories into the history of the vehicles.<br /><br />What is Cosmic Motors?<br /><br />  Cosmic Motors is an independent manufacturer of vehicles of all kinds, located in the center of the Galaxion Galaxy. CoMo, as it is affectionately referred to by its fans, was founded by the famous Redooa brothers in the Galaxion year 8966-B. (From the book)<br /><br />The most amazing part of the book is the super realistic renders. Those sexy models standing beside the vehicles are real life models. They are composited onto the 3D illustration later on. Details are added later, such as reflections of the models and mechanics on the glossy car surfaces. The photos, no, illustrations are printed big for showing off all the glorious details. They are so good I have hard time believing they are not real.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended for concept artists into futuristic designs and vehicles.<br /><br />(More pictures are available on my blog.

B001GAOY5U|4.0|I was not overwelmed with the story line but the 3D version with my Sony Bravia LCD was a visual eyefest.  Especially the parts where the vines and other landscapes are shown. Far superior to The Polar Express 3D movie version. It gets alittle tiring on the eyes since the whole movie is in 3D including the credits but it is a good reference Blu-Ray for your widescreen LCD.
B001CDLATE|5.0|This movie is an amazing experience!  In Blu-ray the visuals and sound are spectacular.  The movie explores the human condition, our shared perspectives and spiritual practices, as well as our frailties, triumphs, and tragedies.  Meaningfully, the film also explores the beauty of nature, and the human spoilage of it.  What a marvelous visual essay about the planet.    MH

B001GQACGO|5.0|As a true lover of music, I must say that Beyonce truly has created an album for mature music lovers. With anything, be it a career or a talent, it is important to expand your horizons and push limits, which is exactly what I Am...Sasha Fierce does. The fact that she is NOT doing the same thing shows her creativiy and maturity as an artist, although the songs could have probably been placed on one album, I think the idea was somewhat creative. Overall, the CD does have a different, yet unique, sound.  It is different from \\"Dangerously In Love\\" and \\"B'Day\\", which speaks for her growth as a woman and an artist. If you are looking for something new and fresh...buy the album.
1439136653|1.0|Vikas Swarup's \\"Q&A\\" (now re-titled \\"Slumdog Millionaire\\") is simply one of the worst novels ever written. Based on the premise of a poor boy winning the Indian version of the quiz program \\"Who wants to be a Millionaire?\\" (\\"Kaun Banega Crorepati\\" in India), the novel is simply a collection of chapters that are lifted straight out of various Bollywood movies, telling a series of improbable tales. These purport to be a sociological explanation of modern India, but are in fact little more than an outsider's version of various news stories about the most gory and obscure aspects of India's dark under-belly (Swarup is a diplomat by profession, and has spent almost all his career outside India, with scant first-hand knowledge of any of what he has written about). Writing awful nonsense (in mediocre prose) about India is a sure way to get rich these days (as the west is much more interested in such tawdry stories than the uplifting, genuinely literary offerings of genuinely great writers like Amitav Ghosh and Vikram Seth).   It is troubling and sad that such trash gets so much press (and is made into Hollywood potboilers too). Hopefully, posterity will know how to separate such chaff from the wheat.
B0012E6R3W|5.0|This is another Testament great, lyrics,musicianship do not pass this album up you will enjoy it if you own and love any other Testament albums this will not disappoint!!!
B00005A0RI|5.0|Nocturne is a wonderful mix of Latin rhythms that both peaks your interest and soothes your soul.  The hallmark for me is the use of different instruments (e.g. violin, tenor sax, acoustic guitar) that support the very solid bass - piano superstructure.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|This has quickly become one of my favorite albums! Taylor Swift is a gifted singer and songwriter. Sure, the themes are repetitive and the lyrics aren't always particularly deep, but they are extremely honest and listening to Taylor's songs gives you the impression that you're reading her journal. And while her voice isn't as powerful as other singers, her personality shines through and she captures the appropriate emotions for every song that she sings. Most importantly, all of her songs are solid and I can easily listen to every song on here, and the majority are incredibly catchy! I also appreciate that her songs are perfectly appropriate for any age group and she sings about topics that are relevant to your average teenager, namely boys.     My review on her songs:     Fearless - 4/5 - This is a solid song where Taylor sings about the best first date she's never had.      Fifteen - 2.5/5 - This song is definitely slow and probably my least favorite on the album, but I do appreciate the lyrics and the advice to other young girls. This shows a lot of maturity on her part.        Love Story - 4.5/5 - Great song where Taylor casts herself as Juliet, but she and Romeo end up married instead of dead! The lyrics are certainly corny, but it's also got a great melody and is overall an enjoyable song.     Hey Stephen - 5/5 - One of the best songs on this album. Her voice is a bit more raw and real on this one and that, along with the humming and laughter throughout the song, make it feel very conversational. This song is very catchy and you'll certainly find yourself singing along.     White Horse - 4/5 - Another fairy tale reference, but here the heroine realizes that there isn't a prince on a white horse coming to rescue her. This song is bittersweet and her emotion comes across clearly.     You Belong With Me - 3.5/5 - This is a cute song about being in love with your best friend and knowing your better suited for him than the girl he's currently with. Her voice is convincing here although it's not a favorite for me.       Breathe - 2/5 - This is my least favorite song on this album. I definitely prefer her more lively songs, but it's still sung well and will resonate with listeners.     Tell Me Why - 5/5 - This is my favorite song on the album. It's about being treated poorly and finally standing up to the other person. The chorus is full of energy. I love it!     You're Not Sorry - 4/5 - Another song in a string of songs about bad relationships. This one is slower, but I really enjoy it. Vocally, it's not her strongest though.        The Way I Loved You - 3.5/5 - This is a solid song and shows a bit of maturity. It's about finding the perfect man, but being dissatisfied because the relationship lacks the passion of her old relationship. It builds, becoming increasingly more aggressive and powerful. Good song!     Forever & Always - 4.5/5 - This is another favorite, about the demise of a relationship. Musically, vocally, and lyrically, it's a lot of fun to listen to.     The Best Day - 5/5 - This is my other favorite from this album. I had to listen to it a few times before it really grew on me. This is a departure from any other songs from Taylor because here, she's singing about her family. I love this song few teenagers are able to express this level of appreciation and love for this families. Her voice is very sweet and innocent on this song. It's a true gem!    Change - 4/5 - This is an interesting song as it seems to have a somewhat political message about not giving up when faced with tough opponents. It was used for the Olympic soundtrack. It's a good song musically, but the theme doesn't really fit in with what Taylor does best which is singing about her life. Still a good song.     As I've already said, this is a great album, completely appropriate for the entire family, and very easy to listen to. Everything I want in my music!

B001G5ZKZS|5.0|This is one of the best concert dvd's I've seen, and certainly the best of Rush's releases. It's about Rush and their performance. It is not about how 'creative' some idiot producer thinks he is when he cuts from one camera to another every second as some I've seen. It shows you camera angles from all over, upclose, and one on the Atlanta disk I 'm watching now that seems to be from the back row of the amphitheatre. If you want to know what it's like to see Rush, buy a ticket next time. For a most reasonable facsimile thereof, buy this DVD. If you're like me and you just love these guys and can't wait till next time, BUY THIS DVD.  THANK YOU ALEX NEIL AND GEDDY.
B001ACH4DS|5.0|I just got this album the other day, and I can't stop listening to it. Cook has managed to create a really eclectic rock record.

Other favorites of mine include \\"Heroes\\", \\"Declaration\\", \\"Avalanche\\", \\"Lie\\", \\"Come Back To Me\\", \\"Life On the Moon\\", \\"Mr. Sensitive\\", and, of course, the first single \\"Light On\\".

B000RW3YYA|5.0|I never watched SG-1 but I caught an episode of Atlantis one day on the SCI FI Channel.  Whoa...the Wraiths had me hooked!  With their nasty habit of feeding off humans you'd think they'd be extremely repulsive.  However, wrap them in black leather coats and striking long white locks, give them audacious fighting skills, and have them go toe-to-toe with the humans and somehow they become the most appealing  \\"bad\\" guys I've ever watched (next to Prince Nuada).  Engaging acting by all--watch my personal favorites of Season 3... \\"Common Ground\\" with Todd the Wraith, \\"Sateda\\",  and \\"McKay and Mrs. Miller.\\"  Skip episodes \\"Irresistible\\" and \\"Irresponsible.\\"   Note: Stargate Atlantis has been cancelled.

038534273X|4.0|The updated version for 2008 doesn't supply anything new other than a chapter on how much richer Brin and Page are, and a more useful chapter on future endeavours.<br />However, if you didn't read the first edition, this is a must read story--especially ten years after the company's debut. As an avid business user of Google, I enjoyed reliving the memories of how simple concepts created millionairs of people like you and me...and how it still does if you just follow the simple plan the boys envisioned.  Even this time around, I still found a couple of things I had forgotten that I immediately incorporated into my current webpage to ensure the googlebot liked me even more. And like clockwork, it worked immediately.<br /><br />If you're new to adwords or adsense, be sure to read the chapters on SEO; it's not as complicated as it seems. If you spend the time and build it properly...they will come!<br />If nothing else, the updated release (as I'm sure it was intended) reminds the online businessperson that this is mandatory reading.

019280264X|4.0|In Mansfield Park, \\"All the world's a stage/And all the men and women merely players.\\" The cast of characters of both the novel and the play within it is drawn from three families and their social circles: the Bertrams of Mansfield Park, the Grants/Crawfords of the parsonage, and the Prices of Portsmouth. Even as she refuses to participate in her cousins' staging of Lovers' Vows, Fanny Price is at center stage as the observer we observe in Austen's social and familial drama.<br /><br />As the poor relation of the Bertrams, Fanny is a natural outsider. Lacking social or financial aspirations, she is free to see the folly of those around her and bound by what seems to have become a quaint form of honor from warning Edmund about his. For all her acquiescence to fate, however, Fanny is not weak. Just as she takes a firm stand about not appearing in the ill-fated Lovers' Vows with its ill-fated cast, she stays on her moral high road even when it requires her to assert herself to Sir Thomas, to whom she is beholden and whose own daughters dare not defy him so directly.<br /><br />Marriage is central to Mansfield Park. Maria Ward \\"had the good luck . . . to be thereby raised to the rank of a baronet's lady, with all the comforts and consequences of an handsome house and large income.\\" Despite the narrator's cynicism, the Bertrams have what seems to be an effective marriage; Sir Thomas is the domineering household head, while his decorative lady provides the services of her busybody widowed sister and her niece Fanny. Lady Bertram's passivity complements Sir Thomas's active nature; she is \\"guided in everything important by Sir Thomas, and in smaller concerns by her sister.\\" She can do without companionship, but only if Sir Thomas reassures her.<br /><br />Motivated by his money and status and her good looks, the Bertrams have established a solid marriage, but its sons and daughters are not its pride. Restrained by and resentful of Sir Thomas's patriarchal hand, his elder son and daughter rebel against and eventually flout his authority and threaten the family's good name. His younger daughter seeks escape through the closest means possible, and even his younger son is spared from his poor judgment only by fate.<br /><br />Unlike Lady Bertram, her youngest sister marries for love, or at least on impulse, and suffers the consequences of ignoring what matters most--money and social standing. Self-condemned to a life of poverty and negligence, Mrs. Price cannot depend on either husband or servants to manage day-to-day life so she can indulge in her natural laziness, as Lady Bertram does. Even as her family lives in filthy squalor, Mrs. Price, could, if she were capable of noticing, take pride in Fanny's personal growth and moral fortitude, William's accomplishments and career, and Susan's promise. Like the Bertrams on their extensive estate, she is trapped in the narrow drama she has written for herself. Those who exit--Fanny, William, Susan--are able, it seems, to craft a more positive narrative for themselves.<br /><br />Like a proscenium arch, the trip to Sotherton and the use of Lovers' Vows frame Fanny's view of the relationships around her. Much of the action takes place out of her sight (to her dismay), but Fanny sees enough to disturb her sense of propriety and to bring to light her own desires. Fanny, and the reader, can only guess what is happening offstage and how it may affect her.<br /><br />Relationships founded solely on money (Rushworths), rebellion or love (Prices, presumably), and lust (Henry/Maria) fare poorly, as does the Crawfords' sister's second marriage (to the admiral). Austen's narrator does not give up on the institution, however. \\"With so much true merit and true love, and no want of fortune or friends . . . happiness . . . must appear as secure as earthly happiness can be,\\" the omnipotent stage director steps in to say after having dispensed justice and wisdom to those characters who require one or the other,just before before the curtain falls on Mansfield Park and environs. In the end and with a heavy hand, the narrator redeems marriage, at least for the deserving (Fanny) and the enduring (the Bertrams).<br /><br />Readers who prefer strong, attractive women may not appreciate Fanny, her apparently rigid morality, and her seeming weakness of will. As a perceptive outsider who understands what she observes, Fanny is a complex character. She knows and respects how Sir Thomas would feel about Lovers' Vows and participates to the extent she can so she can keep an eye on Edmund. She knows where his future unhappiness lies, yet does not deter him although it is in her power. She may be judgmental, as people are, but she asserts herself strongly only when she is herself affected, for example, when she is wanted for the play and when Henry pays his attentions. She is true to herself and allows others the same freedom, succeed or fail, with her real feelings hidden within her inner emotional life.<br /><br />Set in a time of war and slave-supported prosperity that seems remote, Mansfield Park can still reach across the years. In spite of the antiquated social and moral codes that rule their lives, the out-of-touch adults, the rebellious children, and the lonely and unconventional heroine still hold interest today.just before before the curtain falls on Mansfield Park and environs.

B001GQACGE|1.0|What can I say I was anxious to buy the new Beyonce CD and ended up buying the Deluxe Edition. All these songs should have been in one CD instead of two. What a way to rip off your fans. For those that have not purchased the cd stick with the regular cd as the 2nd one was a disappointment. Between the two I can say I only liked about 4 songs. I ended up giving the cd to my cousin...next time I will just download what I like....(: ....very very disappointed here..

Very funny situational comedy called 'The Rounder.'<br /><br />You may have never heard of it, but it is a classic to watch and to share with your friends and family.

This is a must see-don't miss out DvD. Even if you don't like musicals, give this a chance because it is not your \\"typical\\" musical. The acting is fantastic, the story line engaging and the songs very catchy (you WILL find yourself singing many of them days after you have viewed it). This will be worth every penny you pay for it and will be a DvD you will watch over and over and over again.

The acting is impeccable, and the music is flawless. Not a scene, not a song, not a word is out of place. This is a story you won't want to miss.<br /><br />The fact that this DVD has two commentaries -- a typical filmmaker's commentary and, appropriately so, a musical commentary -- is unique in and of itself. The fact that it's the same stellar crew that put together the Sing-Along blog itself guarantees brilliance. The other special features, such as the \\"making of\\" videos, are horribly satisfying.

B001CTA1RK|1.0|Frank Martin (Jason Statham) is a transporter forced into doing a job he doesn't want. It involves delivering Valentina, the kidnapped daughter (Natalya Rudakova) of a politician, to Odessa. His employer is the villainous Mr Johnson (Robert Knepper), who is being paid to have the countryside of Ukraine opened to toxic waste pollution.     If the plot sounds ridiculous well it's implementation is even worse, as Martin fights off one gang of bad guys after another in a series of absurd and very boring martial art sequences. This flick resembles a video game more than a high quality action movie like the \\"Bank Job\\". Martin is like a super hero without any special powers or a low rent (very low rent) James Bond. It's all completely predictable and boring, even the sex scene with Martin and the annoying Valentina is lame. Obviously, this clunker is not worth the time or money.
B0014DZ2VO|4.0|James Bond (Daniel Craig) is seeking revenge for the death of his lover Vesper Lynd, and is also after an organisation called \\"Quantum\\" that no one knew existed - and stopping the environmentallist Dominic Greene (Mathieu Almaric) from taking control of a poor country's supply of it's \\"most precious resource\\"...<br /><br />Not as good as the superb Casino Royale - I might even say a disappointment - but I still enjoyed it! Daniel Craig is excellent in it, his Bond has his own agenda and is out for revenge - and there are some impressive stunts, fights and chases, and bursts of pretty strong violence. It's certainly exciting to watch.<br />However, I felt the plot and story didnt have as much focus as the previous film, and Mr. Greene isnt nearly as good a villain as Le Chiffre in Casino Royale - IMO he didnt seem dangerous enough and there wasnt much motivation to go after him.<br />I did like how the relationship between Bond and his boss M (Judi Dench) unfolds - at one point M gets so annoyed with him she cuts off his credit cards.<br /><br />Also, it occurs to you as you watch Bond chase (like in the superb opening car chase or rooftop free running) or beat people up, you're not really introduced to these people - hence you don't know them or reallly CARE what Bond is doing as much. Also the camera moved so fast it was sometimes hard to see what was going on.<br />You understood why he felt how he did - \\"trust no one\\" though as he was very hurt by his lover's death.<br />I loved Olga Kurylenko who was gorgeous as Camille, she was a great character on the same level as Vesper, as she was sexy and strong but also had emotional depth. However, British actress Gemma Arterton (Strawberry Fields? Oh for the love of...) was a waste as a Bond girl and really isnt given much to do - but in one of her scenes there's a neat reference to an earlier Bond classic, see if you can spot it!<br />The lack of gadgets, stupid quips and sex is refreshing however, and I liked how it picked up where Casino Royale left off (to all intents and purposes, this film is really a continuation, and in that sense a departure for the Bond franchise).<br />You will get more from this film if you have seen Casino Royale before though.<br />I realise I may have sounded negative sometimes during this critique - in my view it is nearly a 4 star movie but I think the reason why I appear disappointed is because I had very high expectations. It was still a good, entertaining film and I will buy it on DVD.ff (to all intents and purposes, this film is really a continuation, and in that sense a departure for the Bond franchise).

B001GQACGO|2.0|A die-hard fan of B's since the early days of Destiny's Child, makes it very painful for me to give her newest album such a poor rating. In the depths of my heart is sadness and disappointment with Beyonce's blatant transition to pop from her R&B roots. I recognize that artists grow and evolve over time--as which is only reasonable and expected-- but it feels as though she ( and maybe her management)is now more intent on making her a Brand that blankets ALL genres for financial and/or egostistical gain, rather than continue to excel in what her fan base knows her for , i.e. hard hitting, major thumpin grroves, and biting lyrics.  I recently read a comment that her father made about Beyonce 'concentrating on becoming an icon'. This, coupled with the fact she is now dabbling in making a country track is giving more indications of her efforts to leave her original, tried and true fans in order to gain unsurpassed fame, fortune, and ultimate diva status. The sad thing is that those efforts have culminated in what is a disjointed, unengaging, and disappointing album ( minus Single Ladies).   Oh B, I thought I knew you...

Joe Seneca is great as an old blues harp player stuck in a New York nursing home for convicted felons. Rediscovered by a young classical guitar prodigy obsessed with the blues, the old man sees an opportunity for redemption and siezes the chance, resulting in an adventure that changes both characters as they travel south toward their destiny. The dialogue can be a little ham-fisted and cliched at times, but most of it goes down easy. Many critics thought the casting of Ralph Macchio as the young guitar player was a disaster, but I have to disagree. Macchio is not a horrible actor, and he conveys the right mix of sincerity and immaturity - you have to believe he's a kid! - to carry his role without much trouble. The film is crafted so it doesn't need to rest on his shoulders anyway. Plenty of colorful secondary characters pop up to keep things interesting, including Jami Gertz in a small but significant part. The climactic scene, featuring guitarist Steve Vai, is alone worth the price of admission. If you keep your ears open, you'll finish \\"Crossroads\\" wanting to hear more Delta blues and that's a reward in itself.
0765356139|5.0|While the storytelling and pacing was excellent, I found myself rooting against Elend though the whole first part of the book.  I was clear to me that the real danger came from the mists, and I knew that Vin wouldn't leave the city until Elend lost his throne.  Instead of feeling suspense, I was frustrated and skimming parts of the book because I wanted Vin to get out there and confront the real threat. (I have a friend who didn't have that problem, though.)  For those who might have my problem, I'll let you in on a secret--preserving the city turns out to be important to the greater battle after all.<br /><br />Other than that, the book was good--good pacing, great world building, interesting characters, and so on. I also found the ending a bit more predicitable than the first book in the series, though I expect most people wouldn't find it so.<br /><br />Genre Reviews<br />[...]
B0001Z36PK|5.0|\\"\\"Happy Goth\\", about the lonely adolescent girl locked in her inarticulacy, costume and attitude, listening to something awful like Nirvana, is deeply affecting in its portrayal of complete communication breakdown (\\"that's what she would say, if she ever talked to you\\")- and it features the bass bassoon: knighthoods all round. I know a young girl like this and she is also lovely inside and out - but her beautiful self has almost sunk to screaming point under the loneliness and image. Desperately sad.\\"    WHAT??...  sorry...  but this person seems to have missed the point of HAPPY GOTH..  the clue being in the title with the first word...    MANY people who the world perceives to be quite miserable because they do not behave in a manner that is dictated by society are actually quite HAPPY!!!  there is great beauty in darkness as well as light...sometimes even more so...  and all the divine comedy music is a great testament to that fact...  finding humour in the darkness as well...  because it's all very dark...even when it is funny..    anyway- sorry if that girl is truly miserable...she might well be..  but this song is not about her if she is..  oh- and goth people do NOT listen to nirvana...      ;-)
B001GQACGO|5.0|I've been a fan of Beyonce for some time now, and she shocks me every time. Now i'll admit the album had to grow on me and B'day to me is still the best, but I Am...Sasha Fierce is good stuff! Up first I Am... the more slower songs, they're intimate and personal and i can relate. They're also beautifully sung, she hasn't lost her touch for slower tracks, Halo, Disappear, Broken-hearted Girl, Ave Maria and Smash Into You are some highlights. You can hear her like you never have before, take everything in, the music, her vocals and the lyrics and there it is. Now for the Ms. Sasha Fierce, fell alittle short to me, but still different, highlands being, Diva, Sweet Dreams, Video Phone and Ego. She still keeps it rolling. Very solid effort from Ms. B-K-C.
B000654YRY|5.0|I bought the CD of this concert when it came out years ago. I was very excited when I found that the DVD had been released and it was well worth the wait. If you like Dire Straits you will love this DVD.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|This is a fabulous series.  I did not watch The West Wing regularly so it is really nice to see it in order by season.  I always wanted to buy the series, but held off due to cost.  Amazon's price was a real bargain!!
B00005N6KG|5.0|Love these headphones, have used these a long time and always go back to them.  Used daily!
B001GQACGE|3.0|I love Beyonce's voice and give her credit for writing her own music, but I must say that this release left me wanting more.  I bought this cd the day it came out.  I honestly can't beleive that she or someone in her camp thought it was a good idea to waste 2 peices of plastic on just 11 songs.  When I first read the back cover and saw this, I figured there must be hidden songs all over the place, but after opening the jewel case, I could literally see how much data was recorded on the two discs. Then there's the deluxe version with 5 extra songs!  I feel like I've been had. I have to say I am actually quite disappointed..
0439023483|5.0|At first I wasn't sure if I wanted to read this book. It just didn't seem like my cup of tea. I'm so glad I decided to read it anyway. Easily one of the best books I read all year, maybe even the last couple of years. I couldn't put it down once I started.<br /><br />I've read that people have called The Hunger Games scary. I don't know if that's the word I would use. I think I would probably call it disturbing. It was hard to believe these young people had to go through what they had to go through. Going into these games knowing the chances of them making it out alive are slim. I felt so many emotions reading this book. Hopefully, sad, disturbed, wishful, etc.<br /><br />I'd recommend this book to everyone. It's truly a great read.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|There is nothing to add to some of these reviews except that a remastering project such as this gives the new production team an opportunity to put their mark on something that was allready accomplished years ago.  First, let me say that I didn't feel it was necessary to -Re-record the original theme.  By Season three the original music was still fine.  Also, Many long time trekker fans have known about the incredible limited budget the original series Had.  Matt Jefferies used almost no money to built the sets and what they accomplished with ambient lighting on the sound stages with the reflective lighting was what it was.  What brought Star Trek to the forefront was the incredible acting and writing that propelled the series.  I was also horrified that the original enterprise was replaced with computer generated media. I think Star Trek should be kept as much in it's original state as possible, flaws an all.<br />I suggest leaving the computer generated graphics and ships for the newer movies and series.......Star Trek is what it was, great science fiction.
B000YABYLA|5.0|Last year, I kept hearing about this movie but I had no idea what it was about. Maybe about Alaska? I don't know. But once I saw the trailer, I knew I had to see it. This movie did not disappoint. It was touching, funny, and had just a hint of romance. I laughed and I'll admit that I cried.<br /><br />Ellen Page and Michael Cera are a believable couple. Absolutely adorable and hilarious together. They're both brilliant actors and I can't wait to see more from the both of them.

031606792X|5.0|This book was the quickest to read fast paced and just the best. It was a good ending and I look forward to other books from this author.
0446579939|5.0|The book was written at a good pace, it kept my interest the whole time I was reading it.    I have been busy being \\"Mommy\\", it's been a long time since I read a book for pleasure and this was a great one to get me back into the swing of reading for fun!  GREAT GREAT book and I look forward to reading ohter Nicholas Sparks books.
B001GAPC1K|4.0|Very good \\"origin\\" superhero movie.  Special effects on the Blu-Ray seem almost flawless.  Like Michael Keaton in Batman, Robert Downey Jr. is a pleasent suprise and can't think of anyone that could have played Tony Stark better.
0374531269|5.0|This book about the boy soldiers of recent wars in Africa was especially meaningful for us because we lived in neighboring Liberia for 2 years just before the wars broke out.  We were teaching school up \\"in the bush\\", and some of the boys thought it would be wonderful to be soldiers when they grew up.  Well, they did not have time to grow up before the wars came and they were conscripted.  The first hand account by Ishmael Beah matches what is published and/or shown about the war events in other countries.  With the current attraction of our boys in the US to video \\"war games\\", they need to read what life is really like for boys in other countries.  Parents need to know and make sure their children  are aware of the plight of children in much of the world.  It would counteract the huge desire for more things and entertainment here, and perhaps would cause our youth to be caring and benevolent to the many causes there are to help the unfortunate of the world.
0756404746|5.0|An amazing read, and will appeal to non-fantasy fans. I've just finished it, and it's easily the best book I've read in years. Kvothe is just such an interesting character, he's a good person who creates a large amount of chaos around him. The writer seemingly knows just how much detail to give, and how much to leave the reader to imagine. I can't wait to read more, and read it over again. It's only just the beginning!
0446613444|5.0|Michael Connelly is one of the best mistery writer and this was one of his better efforts.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This is easily the best Disney/Pixar movie yet!!  It is a really funny movie.  It also has an environmental aspect to it.  This is a great movie that you will want to watch over and over again!!
B001FEO6PK|5.0|Jason Becker has a new album, with some kind of \\"best of\\" compilation plus three new songs. Also the CD has a bonus material if you play it on a computer.    Jason Becker is a true master. With all the bad things he is going through, a new release is a victory over the destiny and a new example of his incredible talent.    Two more things: Jason is an example of the will for life and music like no other, and, by the way, he's still better musician and player than you and me.    Thank you Jason. Thank you for teaching us how to live the life and for the everyday inspiration.
B001CZVVWS|2.0|This was supposed to be a magnificent return of Aida to La Scala. It is very disappointing. The singers and their signing and acting are OK, but far away of being magnificent. The sound of the Disc is certainly not portraying the incredible amount of people on the stage, in Act II in particular. Bluray technology allows for a much fuller sound. The worst of all is the video production and camera movements. The close-ups in the middle of the arias and the ballet make no sense at all and are really disturbing.<br />The only reason to buy this Disc is to see the glitzy production in full Bluray detail. Verdi deserves better!
B00023B1A8|2.0|It astonishes that so many believe the \\"supergroup\\" hype about these guys.  They made two studio LPs, those having the advantage of studio overdubbing and the usual tricks.  They made a double-live LP.  They played very little together, actually, because it's rare a stage is large enough to accommodate more than one of their egos at a time.    Two studio LPS and a double-live in 30-40 years, and they've been sitting on that.  And this shows the weaknesses -- the holes in their harmonies, etc. -- of their live performances.     The same mega-hype applies to \\"Buffalo Springfield\\".  They made -- what? -- two LPs, and the second was mostly tracks left over from the first.  And yet one would think they'd produced a brilliant LP per year for 40 years.  I recall \\"seeing\\" \\"Buffalo Springfiled\\" in 1967: they came out on stage, spent some 10 minutes tuning up, then left the stage.  That was the entire concert.     It can only be that they were from CA, and CA hypes their groups to Heaven, regardless whether they deserve it.    There are few worthwhile spots in this.  But Steven Stills' \\"musicianship\\"!?  Try to recognize his awful solo performance of \\"What's That Sound?\\" -- Gawd-awful in all particulars.
B001DHXT2U|3.0|The movie seemed to drag out a little until the very end and the action took place.
0143143492|4.0|I have been listening to A New Earth, by Eckhart Tolle, for the last two weeks each night before I fell asleep. I must admit, I was a little skeptical about this book, but I found it very soothing and relaxing at bedtime. The first chapter drew me in immediately. When I was finished, it really made me think about the concepts, and how I could immediate apply these concepts to my personal situation.<br /><br />The audio book is read by the author, and is about 8-9 hours of listening time. This book was originally released in 2005, but has become an overnight sensation thanks largely to Oprah's enthusiastic endorsement. In fact, Oprah has hosted a 10-week web based course conducted by Tolle; some two million students participated.<br /><br />According to the author, The key to more joy and purpose is by living in the present moment. Rather, \\"being\\" in the present moment. This is accomplished by slowly dismantling the \\"ego\\". Many authors have written about the desirability of living \\"in the Now,\\" but few have laid out such a clear method that one can understand. The chapters are as follows:<br /><br />  *  Chapter 1: The Flowering of Human Consciousness<br />  *  Chapter 2: Ego: The Current State of Humanity<br />  *  Chapter 3: The Core of Ego<br />  *  Chapter 4: Role-playing: The Many Faces of the Ego<br />  *  Chapter 5: The Pain-Body<br />  *  Chapter 6: Breaking Free<br />  *  Chapter 7: Finding Who You Truly Are<br />  *  Chapter 8: The Discovery of Inner Space<br />  *  Chapter 9: Your Inner Purpose<br />  *  Chapter 10: A New Earth<br /><br />Although I really enjoyed listening to this book, I did find that some of the information seemed to be repeated a lot, but perhaps that was to reinforce the message. As an audio book, some of the concepts were a bit difficult to grasp and retain, so for the serious reader who wants to absorb every detail of Tolle's message, I would suggest getting the paperback copy as well to refer to.<br /><br />This book is highly recommended.
0321525655|5.0|I can't quite remember why I ordered this book--but I have been entranced by it!  To match the simple beauty of this book, I should be posting an intriguing photo with a poignant quote.  Hmm--perhaps it would be that line that goes something like:  People will remember not what you made them think but how you made them feel.  The picture might be a peaceful beach scene with someone sitting cross-legged with a slight buddha smile, feeling the warmth of the sun on her face.  Well, all these words underline the message that getting your audience's attention with a sharp image and putting up as few words as possible is the way to transform presentations.  I'm hard at work simplifying, eliminating as many bullet poings as possible, and transforming my presentations for maximum emotional content.
B001ED7C58|4.0|This was a great soundtrack.  Amazon shipped it in very reasonable time.  No complaints.
076790592X|5.0|This book is awesome. I read it after my mother passed away and I was only 16 yr. This book taught me so much and I carry it as a sort of life guide...when I feel I'm forgetting the lesson I just refresh myself. This is my most prized book and I still have it near after 10 yrs. Buy this book for any youth you love that has lost or is lost in the world and it will brighted their mind to see that there is more.
B001GAOY5U|2.0|My wife and I watched the 3D version of Journey to the Center of the Earth.  She loved it.  I hated it. The 3D glasses gave me a headache, but my wife thought it was special.  So 50% loved the movie, and 50% say save your money.  We both thought that the 2D version might have been easier to watch.  However, we both agreed that the plot was so weak that neither of us wanted to run the Blu-ray DvD again. So I gave this movie 2 stars.  Buy only if you need to see a weak plot with plastic 3D glasses.
1567184855|5.0|Fascinating book! No matter what religion you subscribe to, this book is a must read. This book goes into much more detail than Dr.Brian Weiss'book \\"Many Lives,Many Masters\\". It is a very detail oriented look of many case studies of past life regression. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B000PMFS2I|5.0|Showgirls was never going to win any Academy Awards and I give Elizabeth Berkley credit for overcoming this film and going on to do good work on CSI:Miami and in other movies.    But Showgirls is a scorching hot mess telling the story of Nomi Malone, a down-on-her-luck, ill-bred, poorly educated girl who dreams of being a professional dancer.    It's a hootchiefied Flash Dance, with Las Vegas as the setting. If breasts and bums are your thing, I highly recommend watching this movie with the sound off. If you like unintentional comedy, watch it with the sound on. Nomi's pronunciation of \\"Versace\\" will tear you up.    As far as the screenwriting goes, there were too many subplots. None of the characters were likable except for the chorus line instructor, who ironically starred in the Michael Douglas A Chorus Line years ago.    Showgirls is a five-star movie simply because it's so bad, it's actually good entertainment.
B0000549B0|5.0|Oh wow! I have been looking for this DVD for a long time.  I LOVE this movie.  Jimmy at his best.  It is an old movie but still a great one.  You will not regret watching it.  So Funny!!!
0736063684|5.0|I went through a pile of exercise, weightlifting, and fitness anatomy books before buying this one.  Strength Training Anatomy not only illustrates and describes - in detail - the anatomy involved in each exercise, but does so for more exercises than comparable books.  It also doesn't shy away from using the proper terms.  I particularly like that the exercise coverage hits a number of variations.  You'll find a number of curls, press, and fly variations, for example, with comments on their differences as it relates to anatomy.  There are also sidebars throughout the book on common injuries.     The anatomy is more than just muscles, too.  Bones, tendons and ligaments, and gender differences are covered in detail.  Variations among individuals are touched on where they are important to training (e.g., elbow structures, hip mobility).  There is a 3-page detailed muscular system illustration at the front of the book, and a 2-page detailed skeleton illustration in the back of the book, along with a handy illustration of major muscle groups.      Execution details are given for each exercise, along with comments on training effect and purpose.  Again, these comments are in considerable detail, making this volume a superb source of material for anyone involved in corrective training.      The only thing missing, in my view, is a good index.  A cross-reference of muscle by exercise would also be a nice thing to have.      My favorite single illustration has to be the muscles involved in the deadlift.  If ever a picture made Pavel Tsatsouline's case for his Power to the People book (focused on deadlift and press) - [[ASIN:0938045199 Power to the People! : Russian Strength Training Secrets for Every American]], this would be it.      This is a terrific book - 144 pages that can be used superficially as a quick training aid or for detailed study.  It manages to serve both purposes well without one getting in the way of the other.

B001ED7C5I|4.0|In the twenty-year long run since 'Fast Car' raced into the American psyche, Tracy Chapman has delighted, wooed, soothed, and even befuddled those of us who tend toward meaningful folk-pop. Perhaps the only downfall of Chapman's latest release, then, is simply one of timing.  Released on November 11th, 2008, 'Our Bright Future' could have picked up on the sweeping, historical energy propugated by the election of Barak Obama to the Presidency a week earlier.  Instead, Chapman's CD exudes a quiet, introspective intimacy that, in fact, opines that 'our bright future' is actually 'in our past'... Huh? In this current political context, this rhetoric simply contradicts the newfound sense of hope many Americans felt with the kind of presidential election many of us thought would not occur during our lifetime.  Gone are the sharp, stinging lyrics of people 'talking about a revolution' or requesting that the president be given 'my honest regards; for disregarding me'.  Older now, and understandably more complacent, Chapman sounds like one who has become comfortable reflecting on the state of our world instead of hoping to make grandiose stands on how to somehow change it.      'Our Bright Future' pays equal attention to matters political as well as personal: 'Conditional', 'A Theory', and 'Thinking of You' reveal the uncertainties and the highs and lows where matters of the heart are concerned.  'I Did It All' captures Chapman at her reflective and witty best as she looks back on a life and a career fraught with few regrets (despite the fact that most of her 20's were admittedly 'lived in a haze').  'Something to See' and 'The First Person on Earth' imagine a world without war and an exploration of 'original sin' and how that still impacts us all today.  Stand out cuts, however, are the CD's opening cut 'Sing For You' and the yearning plea of 'Save Us All'.  'Sing For You' manages to wrap itself around the listener with understated and simple lyrics and a melody that is oneof Chapman's most endearing to date.  This song's best quality, however, is its ability to stir emotion and engender contemplation with a chorus that is 'sung' without words... Quite simply, this song must be experienced to be truly and wholly appreciated.  'Save Us All' is Chapman's cry to religion as the vehicle that will (hopefully) one day be our ultimate salvation.  Though she sings of Jesus with commitment and conviction, Chapman also acknowledges the faith of others around the world and eventually comes to the conclusion that it really doesn't matter what God you worship...but, hopefully, one of these Gods will one day 'Save Us All...and love the sinners, too'.  For some, this song, and this CD in total, may come off as a whitewashed, watered-down, weary-minded complacency that lacks the drive and the fire of much of Tracy Chapman's early works.  But Chapman, now in her mid-40's, should be allowed to write from that place in her life where her heart, mind, and soul presently reside.  Understandably, the meteoric zoom and rise of her 'fast car' has slowed to a reflective cruise... The question, though, that many long-time listeners of this gifted singer may be haunted with is 'Has Chapman shifted into a state of cruise control?'...  As for me, I prefer to think not.  I am, however, unable to forget about the notion that music- and especially folk/rock- plays best when it is rooted in the current times and the present psyche of the world at large.  Inevitably, the downtrodden spirit of this disc contradicts with the exuberance of many in this time which may well go down as one of this nation's most crucial turning points of the last half-century.  'Our Bright Future', then, may, in fact, be ahead of us.
B001DU8T6S|4.0|Well being that was/am one of the biggest Queen fans on the face of the earth, I was really depressed when I had heard that Freddie Mercury had passes away. I've seen a lot of musicians kick the bucket over the years, but his death really hit me with a sense of sadness?<br /><br />Well here we are almost two full decades later, listening to a new Queen offering from two of the surviving members (to bad John Deacon wasn't involved?.) I knew before I ever tossed this disc into my cd player that it would not come anywhere near the genius that was Queen in it's heyday, but I had high hopes that it would at least contain some bright spots with them members that were now carrying the torch so to speak.<br /><br />Does it sound like Queen, not on your life, but it's not supposed to. Nothing will ever sound like Queen again! What we have hear is a straight up rock & roll cd that does work. You do get some snippets of that old school Queen vide from Brian Mays playing and Roger Taylor's (very under rated drummer) drumming, but again, it's something fresh and new and if you're looking for say classic sounding Queen, your looking in the wrong place. Paul Rogers is one of the all time best rock singers in history and he does not tarnish his reputation here. His vocals are fantastic and the band itself is very pleasing to the ear.<br /><br />If Brian May and Roger Taylor wanted to try and sound like old school Queen, they would have recruited some Freddie Mercury clone or at least someone who sang somewhat like him. The dude from Wham comes to mind (I can't remember his name?) as he did a fine job at the farewell concert way back when. However I believe that the remaining members believed that replacing Freddie was an impossible job and thus decided after many years to just write and see what happened with it. Paul Rogers comes onboard and the rest is history.<br /><br />I will admit this cd took me about ten listens before I began to truly appreciate it for what it was. Now that I've had it for about three weeks now and have listened to it many times I've really come to quite enjoy it's feel. You wont find any outstanding tracks, but it's all very solid from start to finish and really is an enjoyable listen.<br /><br />If you cue it up and go, \\"what is this?\\" be patient, it'll grow on you like it has me and may even become one of your favorites it time. This cd is a great start to an old band that has found a new groove with a fresh face and some very classy sounding tunes.<br /><br />Well done ladz!<br /><br />John I miss your bass playing, you rocked man!!ee weeks now and have listened to it many times I've really come to quite enjoy it's feel. You wont find any outstanding tracks, but it's all very solid from start to finish and really is an enjoyable listen.

B0019EXZY4|5.0|I didn't know anything about this film prior to seeing it other than that it was based on a true story about a group of English petty criminals who decide to tunnel beneath a bank in order to rob safe deposit boxes. The heist is the idea of a woman played by Saffron Burrows, who has a specific and ulterior motive for wanting to rob a certain safe deposit box.    Jason Statham shows that he's grown as an actor in this one. He's moved beyond simply scowling and karate chopping people in the windpipe. His crew members are distinct and colorful, and they are extremely likeable despite their criminal acts.    This film isn't fancy. It's a sad story told simply and in straightforward fashion. It's not as polished as The Italian Job or as smarmy as Ocean's Eleven, Twelve and Thirteen. It's a no-frills tale that will leave you wondering at the lengths people will go to for wealth and to save their skin when they get in trouble.
B001BKG9SK|5.0|The dvd portion of this boxed set didn't play one track.  An email to Amazon resulted in a new set within two days! We are now enjoying the whole boxed set.  We wouldn't hesitate to order anything from Amazon, excellent customer service.
B000P7V45S|2.0|I've been a big Genesis fan for ages, and \\"Trick\\" has always been one of my favorites.  I was recently in Japan on tour and was very excited to pick up the new 'remastered' version.  But I was shocked when I heard it.  This is not just a sonic upgrade, it is a completely new mix,.  And frankly, it is not as good a mix as the original.  Among the many changes, the keyboards are not loud enough, a noticeable difference.  On top of that, it seems some of the vocals have actually been re-cut, which is frustrating to listen to.  If they wanted to do all this tweaking they should have characterized this release differently, called it \\"New 2008 Version\\" or something... The word 'remaster' is misleading.      This almost reminds me of the spiffed-up new versions of the original Stars Wars trilogy.  A big disappointment.  Look for the earlier 'definitive edition remaster' version from 1994.  2 stars because it's still a classic.
B000KKPN5C|5.0|This is a really great item! Indoor pictures look just brilliant, when the flash is turned up to the ceiling. No more white and shiny faces, long live the true colors!    If you cannot decide between Nikon D40 and D60, take the D40 and buy this flash for the saved money!
B001KQIAXM|4.0|I've always known about Beyonce... she's been hovering in my orbit for years now but never has she touched down like she has with this album. I loved her in Dreamgirls and \\"Get me Bodied\\" makes this late 20something white-boy body do crazy things on the dancefloor. Last week when this album could be streamed over AOL a friend of mine and I listened with our mouths gaping open.  She completly blew us away.  The concept is great with the two disks but like most two disks it should have been condensed into one but out of all these songs there is very few filler. I beleive what she was trying to do with this concept was start it off with a broken girl, and as the disk progreses its like the Pheonix emerges from the ashes.  To finish the album with \\"Scared of Lonely\\" was just brillient (as was the concept of the \\"If I Were a Boy\\" video)..  it shows a strong woman with vunerability.  Pop art doesnt really get any better than this and not since Madonna can I listen and look at an entertainer and think \\"wow, this girl's a superstar\\".  Beyonce, you've come a long way girl and you're only getting better.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|Elf is simply one of the best holiday movies EVER. I put this one right up there with A Christmas Story, A Charlie Brown Christmas, and Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer, the very programme to which Elf plays homage.    Will Ferrell is brillant as Buddy, the human orphan who found a home and love at the North Pole with Papa Elf, one of Santa's employees. When Buddy decides to return to New York City to find his birth father, hilarity ensues.    Elf has wonderfully funny goofy moments, poignant moments, disgustingly funny moments -- like when he eats the already-been-chewed gum from a subway railing -- and a few serious moments.    Zooey Deschanel is great as Buddy's love interest, and James Caan and Mary Steenburgen are solid as Buddy's father and stepmother.    Elf is an intelligent, endearing comedy suitable for the entire family. Just make sure your little ones know that cotton balls aren't food, and that no matter what Buddy says, syrup is not a food group.

055358894X|5.0|Scott Lynch has woven a spell-binding tale set in a detailed fantasy realm.  Locke Lamora lives the adventures most only dream of, and does so in style.  For lovers of fantasy stories like those of Raymond E. Feist's Midkemia or David Eddings, this is a book not to be missed.  Lynch goes beyond the limits of a standard fantasy book and imbues his characters with vivid humanity.  The story combines high adventure with fantasy and a compelling personal tale, switching from intense combat to elaborate schemes in moments.  Be sure to add it to your collection.

B00005JKTF|5.0|I loved this movie! It has war time romance and adventure of a young, bright woman, who was willing to risk her life by parachuting into Nazi occupied France. Her fluency in French, coupled with her keen intellect, made her an instant choice for this mission -- all quite believeable. The varied associations along the way made it so much more interesting. The scenery was so gorgeously filmed and inspiring, that I took a trip to SW France to see it for myself and was not disappointed! I truly admire Cate Blanchett, and her acting in this film was wonderful. The supporting roles were also quite well done. I found the movie very entertaining and would guarantee the same for nearly anyone. Terry(silverwings442002@yahoo.com)
B001F7MSFM|2.0|The best part of Hellboy II: The Golden Army was the first few minutes when backstory was given in The Princess Bride-style with Hellboy's adoptive father reading him the story of The Golden Army. The cuts to the prepubescent Hellboy had me asking myself, \\"Why is Hellboy being portrayed as such a p---y?\\" It was frustrating and annoying to see the child version of the brusgue, rough-hewn character I'd come to like as portrayed by Ron Perlman.    Ron Perlman had me years ago in Beauty and the Beast, and his performance in this film was solid. The problem was the emphasis on the interpersonal relationships between the characters. I think the director and screenwriter strove too hard to marry the fantasy elements with the real-life problems of ordinary people problems.    Hellboy and his companions aren't ordinary people, so they became far too cartoonish and dull when they were behvaving like regular folk.    Doug Jones is wonderful in every movie I've ever seen him in. His Silver Surfer is one of the sexiest figures in an action movies.    Hellboy II: The Golden Army is worth a watch, but don't expect the movie to be as endearing and interesting as Hellboy.    I hope there's a Hellboy III because I love the characters and I don't want Hellboy II to be the endnote to the Hellboy movie franchise.

B001DTPZNY|3.0|I love Harrison Ford, Cate Blanchett and Shia LaBoeuf, but I did not love Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull. I very much enjoyed the nods to previous Indiana Jones films, and the cinematography and special effects were excellent.    This outing didn't have the excitement and cohesiveness of Raiders of the Lost Ark, the sheer spectacle of The Temple of Doom, or the charm and heart of The Last Crusade. That said, this movie had some wonderful high points. If you don't like ants, there's a scene you should skip.    I wouldn't recommend this film for children under the age of five as there are a few scenes that might give them nightmares. This is an ideal adventure movie to watch with your older children.
0670020745|1.0|As a neuro ICU nurse, i could only bare to read about 75 pages of this book. If this woman was truly critical and believed that she was close to death (yeah right) and bleeding so badly that it encompassed (from what she was describing) about 1/3 of the left side of her brain, she would have been taken to the OR IMMEDIATELY, not sent home WITHIN A FEW DAYS without any intervention other than close monitoring. its obvious that she does not fully understand her own passion, the brain, when she complains about the nurses and doctors at the hospital checking up on her every couple of hours. Hello, lady. you had a ruptured AVM. they're monitoring for brain swelling, additional bleeding, midline shift, herniation (at the worst), whatever.    this woman is not only condescending to her audience (spelling out \\"ischemic\\" and \\"hemorrhage\\", like the general public doesnt know how to pronounce it or understand what a hemorrhage is) but she obviously thinks she can get away with pretty much BS.    Sorry, but this woman has proven that although i may not be a Brain Scientist from Harvard, i obviously know more about the brain than she does. Sad.    this book is fiction. or just a joke, period. theres a reason its not on the new york times best-seller list.
B0019IB0II|5.0|I found the book totally engaging. Perhaps it is not for everyone but critics should be reminded that Jill`s personality shines through at the end chapters. By<br />then most of us feel very interested in her personal views even if we dont agree with all of it.  The writing is not amatuerish as one critic posted  Jill has made an exceptional contribution to so many in our society with her memoir.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Beautiful story in every way!  So what if it was completely improbable.  Maybe we could just look at this as a fantasy and sit back and enjoy the story and incredible music that comes along with the package.    Also, Freddie Highmore was adorable in this film.  He is such a talented actor.

0895260131|5.0|Finally, an unabashed and forthtelling perspective on Islam.  While we in the West are comfortable and unassuming, a rising tide is coming our way called Islam.  Over 80% of the world wide terrorism today is being committed by fanatics who use Islam as their justification and doorstop for hate, violence, and death.  And you know, they are right.  Just read the Koran.   Take what has happened in India as an example.   I applaud the writer and I wish more people, especially our Government, would wake up.
0810993139|1.0|\\"Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" sets out to recount what real life is like for young boys, which it does in many ways, but misses every opportunity to present morality lessons for the reader.  The day-to-day actions and thoughts of the main character are not presented as wrong or right, but as the-way-it-is, which does a disservice to young readers and parents searching for books that their kids will want to read.  While adults may laugh out loud at some of the antics in this book, kids may be left with the impression that calling other kids \\"morons\\" is an appropriate attitude and reasonable form of expression.  Bullying younger kids is presented as a \\"right-of-age\\" rather than an act to be discouraged.      I suppose with TV and movies pushing the envelope of good manners, \\"children's literature\\" will naturally follow.  This book does not appeal to the better angels in us, but appeals to the lowest common denominator.    Anyone searching for books to enrapture their young boys should pick up the works of Mark Twain.  Those stories appeal to the mischievous side of boys while clearly demonstrating right and wrong behavior.  They also tackle social issues still relevant today.
B000UJ48SQ|4.0|Since I love this movie I'll limit myself to the issue of the aspect ratio.  In summary: Kubrick wanted the film to look this way--a decision he made while preparing the now out-of-print \\"Collection\\" of his films.    According to an Editor's Note on the 1999 release (found here (Amazon doesn't allow URL-insertion, so you'll have to copy-paste): [...] the Aspect Ratio is exactly the way The Master intended.    According to the WB spokesperson quoted on the above ref'd page, \\"In every respect, the films in the Collection remain as Kubrick approved them.\\"  (who was that decided on these description? 16X9 TVs are more accurately described as full-screen that 4X3 TVs which leave a very large area of the screen unused).    So, while the 4X3 \\"full\\" screen is annoying for those of us with 16X9 TVs, it they way Kubrick wanted us to see it.  (He also favored mono over stereo because of the vast differences in theatrical audio equipment and quality; e.g. the original cut of \\"Star Wars: A New Hope\\" had mono (the overwhelming majority of theaters, back then, had one speaker placed behind the screen), 2-channel stereo, and 5 channel stereo mixes for those tiny number of theaters which had them in 1977 (two years AFTER \\"Barry Lyndon\\"!).    Unfortunately, Amazon's product description of this version frustratingly doesn't indicate if it comes with even a 2.1 stereo version, let alone a full 5.1 mix.    Either way, it's still a great movie, gorgeously photographed and including all the hallmarks of his inimitable style.
B000UR9T7I|4.0|Yes, this movie is a little cliche and has three villains and plots, but is entertaining.  Most people will agree that this could have been at least two separate movies.  With pressure from the studio that this would be the last of the Spider-Man franchise the director tried to fit as much in as he could, with mixed results.  Because this item was once included with Playstation 3's a while back, it is a very common Blu Ray and has decreased in value.  If you don't have this movie in your collection, the price makes the decision to add it to your collection a little easier.
B00005V0X5|1.0|I am so ticked (of course I would use other words) I was so excited about once again having this album (since I first purchased it on cassette in the 80s)and was with the remixes and the new art (although I personally preferred the originals) but these where much better mixes than the so far so good so what those where very disappointing compared to the originals....anyway, what really put me over the edge was the badly bleeped out new version of these boots! It's like they could have just muted the vocal track! or remixed it out but no instead an outrageously ridiculous loud beep over all the music ( you cant even hear anything else! over it) and  he swears through half the song so...its pointless!!! shouldve been mixed out so we could still enjoy the song or removed all together just %$E(&^$)me off! now I realize that Dave undoubtedly wanted us to know and be bothered....and I realize now (since I looked it up) why...but it was unacceptable and ruined the whole of the purchase! yes it ruined it in my eyes! I was very excited about hearing this cover again and Dave should have thought more of the fans then wanting to prove something or vent his frustration all he did was passed it on to us!

B001GJOL22|3.0|I was really looking forward to this bluray version of Rush's latest Concert. The Audio soundtrack is a available in DTS-HA-MA on this disc and so you would expect it to be crystal clear. It wasn't! The sound was muddy, shrill and lacked any bass end extention. Geddy was playing his heart out and yet that obvious enthusiasm just did not come across in this audio mix. This is not the first DVD from Rush that has had a poor mix. Rush in Rio was the same. The Anniversary Concert in between Rio and this one has excellent audio production however, so it seems to be a bit of a lottery where Rush are concerned.    That having been said it is a really good concert with some more obscure songs being played as well as more familiar ones. It is worth getting just be aware that on the bluray disc the audio is not up to par.
0061438294|5.0|'What Every Body is Saying',<br />by Joe Navarro<br /><br />If I could recall correctly, my initial introduction to social behavioural patterns of non-verbal communications probably began with Julius Fast's 'Body Language' during the seventies, followed by one of Desmond Morris' well-illustrated books, 'Manwatching: A Field Guide to Human Behaviours', in the late seventies.<br /><br />My fascination with the subject grew, particularly from the standpoint of developing a competency in reading people, with the acquisition & reading of Allan Pease's 'Body Language: How to Read Others' Thoughts by Their Gestures', & more specifically, Gerhard Gschwandter's 'Non-Verbal Selling Power' during the eighties.<br /><br />I reckon, with the wisdom of hindsight, those were roughly the pivotal books in guiding me to understanding the significance of body language in human interactions.<br /><br />Throughout the ensuing years from the eighties, I didn't pursue any newer books on the subject, until very recently when I have come across Joe Navarro's book.<br /><br />The author is a former FBI counter-intelligence special agent, which somehow has given the book an iota of authenticity, in contrast to an aura of mystery, about speed-reading people.<br /><br />In a nut shell, speed-reading people successfully is essentially learning about the world around us, decoding & determining the meaning of non-verbal communications as manifested through facial expressions, gestures, touching, physical movements, posture, body adornment & even the tone, timbre, & volume of a person's voice - to predict human actions.<br /><br />More specifically, it's collecting non-verbal intelligence to assess a person's thought, feelings & intentions, a competency that can be mastered through constant practice & proper training.<br /><br />This wonderful book, with clear, concise & succinct writing on the part of the author, has been designed to serve that purpose.<br /><br />It starts off in the beginning with the ten commandments for observing & decoding nonverbal communications successfully, followed by an insightful exposition of how our evolutionary triune brain structure contributes to our hardwired responses to the world.<br /><br />For me, just understanding the freeze, flight & fight responses as well as an appreciation of the comfort/discomfort & pacifying routines - in reality, these are parts of our very robust survival mechanisms - has facilitated my renewed journey to becoming a better speed-reader of people. The author has discussed these emotional aspects at great length (Chapter II).<br /><br />From Chapter III to VII, the author went on to discuss the non-verbals of the feet & legs; the torso, hips, chest & shoulders; the arms; the hands & fingers; & the face, respectively.<br /><br />I have never seen such extensive as well as illuminating treatment along the foregoing lines by any of the other authors I have encountered earlier.<br /><br />In spite of all the relevant insights & expert advice which the author has openly shared in his book, he has concluded in the end analysis that there is, however, one type of human behaviour that is difficult to read, & that is deception.<br /><br />Nevertheless, the author has outlined for readers a dozen of important things to do & valuable points to keep in mind in the course of any interpersonal interactions. Reading them, I come to realise that they all boil down to developing acute observational skills.<br /><br />In fact, the first commandment from the author, as outlined in the beginning segment of his book rings very true: be a competent observer of our environment.<br /><br />As a case in point, with the author's assertion in the concluding chapter, paying attention to the synchrony between what is being said verbally & non-verbally, between the circumstances of the moment & what the subject is saying, between events & emotions, & even synchrony of time & space can often provide valuable clues to detecting deception.<br /><br />Additionally, when we speak, we naturally utilise various part of our body - such as the eyebrows, head, hands, arms, torso, legs & feet to emphasise a point about which we feel deeply or emotionally. Observing such emphasis can also provide valuable tips on detecting deception.<br /><br />To end this book review, I like to paraphrase a quote from the author's friend, as a result of the friend's personal experience in navigating the car to an unknown destination (in Coral Gables, Florida), mentioned in the epilogue:<br /><br />\\"Once I knew what to look for & where to look, the signs were obvious & unmistakable. I had no trouble finding my way.\\"<br /><br />That reaction also more or less sums up my sentiment about developing mastery in speed-reading people.<br /><br />[Reviewed by Lee Say Keng, Knowledge Adventurer & Technology Explorer, November 2008], torso, legs & feet to emphasise a point about which we feel deeply or emotionally.

It's really hard for artists to please their fans and critics all the time. In this business if you seem too confident and your not crying, complaining or belittleing yourself or demeaning your character are to please the less confident you usually get a lot of backlash. This artist is already a legend of our generation so let's give credit to the individuals who are positive & empowering. Oh wait that sounds like a personal critique...

B00132GBRA|5.0|I've done a lot of hiking and backpacking, but I've never made an investment in really \\"good\\" hiking boots. Finally I decided it was time when I decided to go on a four day backpacking trip on the Appalachian trail last October. I couldn't afford the higher end boots ($160-250), so I settled on these as it was a brand I knew and they were the cheapest I could find with GORE-TEX and Vibram.     Now, EVERYONE, knows that you never, ever, ever go on a backpacking trip with new boots. Ever. I knew this, so I ordered these well in advance. Unfortunately ShoeMall (whom I ordered from) took a really long time to ship them, and they came less than a day before I had to leave. I didn't really have any choice but to wear them, so I splurged on some Smartwool socks (HIGHLY recommended--backpacking with them is a totally new experience) to try to alleviate the blisters.     Well, I never expected what I got. These boots were very, very comfortable. I have high arches and under-pronate--how they would work for people with other types of feet I can't say, but I suspect it wouldn't much matter.     The boots have good ankle support--not super, but good--and that was all I needed. I'm young and have strong ankles, and I'd rather have less weight than more support. I did sort of twist my foot once on the trip, but I was fine. People who need a lot of support might look elsewhere. This isn't a shortcoming of the product--it's just a characteristic.     The grip is excellent. That's to be expected, they have Vibram. I did slip a few times, but it was on really wet rocks, and it may have been, as my friend put it, a user issue.     As for the waterproofing, well, you could spend $300 and you wouldn't find a more waterproof boot. It rained the first and second days, and I never felt the tiniest drop of dampness. At one point I literally submerged my foot in a river to see if any water would get in. Nada.     Overall these boots have everything I want. They may not be perfect for everyone, but if you don't have special needs (like extra support), this is the best bang you'll ever get for your buck. As I said, I took these on a four day backpacking trip on the Appalachian trail without ever wearing them before. I had a 30 pound pack. On the last day I hiked 17 miles--lots of up and down. I didn't get any blisters. None. At the end of the last day I was starting to get a small hotspot on one foot, but that was all. I'm not suggesting you take these backpacking without breaking them in, but these are as comfortable as you'll get. Just make sure you invest in some good wool hiking socks as well.       Update: I've now had the boots for over a year and a half. I've hiked parts of the Appalachian trail, the high country above Zion Canyon, the grabens of Canyonlands NP, and the Grand Canyon. At the Grand Canyon I hiked from the south rim to the river and back in a day. It's a tad under 20 miles, with 5000 vertical feet of descent on the way down, and that same 5000 coming back up. When I got back up to the top my whole body ached--except my feet. These boots are light, supportive, and 100% waterproof. I've hiked hundreds of miles in them and they're still in great shape with no real signs of wear.

B001GJOL22|5.0|Knowing that most(if not all)Rush fans with blu-ray players will buy this anyway, this latest offering delivers in spades. Many concert videos can get a bit annoying with the constant camera angle changes but they seem to have found a great balance for this one. You really get the sense of being there...front row, backstage, onstage...in the crowd...whatever. The video quality is stunning, definitely reference material.      The DTS-HD mix is superb, I found the balance and punch to be excellent. Great overall mix of Geddy, Alex, and Neil's instruments.  Some of Alex's vocals get lost but hey......nothing tragic.  Some of the reviewers thought Ged's voice has suffered in the later years but I suggest his pipes are in better shape on this recording than on R30 or Rush in Rio.       I was thrilled with this setlist, with some classic nuggets like \\"Circumstances\\" and the revival of \\"Between the Wheels\\" (one of my favorites) mixed in with lots of tracks from Snakes and Arrows.  After all, this is the \\"Snakes and Arrows\\" tour right?     Interesting for me to note how sparse the stage is at this point, meaning back in the day, Geddy and friends had all kinds of cables and cords going everywhere, but not anymore.     Musically these guys are top notch...30 plus years of playing together is evident throughout the show, and by the looks on their faces they still enjoy playing live.     Anyway, I'll add my vote to the \\"must buy\\" category, certainly for Rush fans, but also for any progressive rock fan who wants to experience the closest thing to attending a concert without buying a ticket.
0375826726|1.0|Once again, Paolini writes an entirely predictable book. And does so with absurd language. \\"Wet blotches quickly sullied the virgin cloth\\" (p. 3). \\"A beatific smile graced his face\\" (p. 5). And so on. It's painful to read. After slogging through his first two books, I give up. With so many great writers out there, I can't bring myself to endure any more of this torture of the English language. My hope for Paolini is that he finds a real editor some day who cuts out all of his junk language, calling him on all of his cliches, while sharpening his plot. When I read evidence of that, I might read him again. But I'm not holding my breath.
B000ATQYT2|3.0|I bought this DVD and was SO disappointed when the Love is Gone song was missing! Why oh why? With the song missing from the middle, the significance of the singing of it at the end is lost. I hope there is another release of this with the song included. I really get tired of these dvd companies doing this. If I am purchasing a dvd, I should get the extras or even all of the original...case in point, Carrey's How the Grinch Stole Christmas....where is NOG, NOG, NOG?   Whatever.
B000SEIK2S|4.0|If you have not read Starship Troopers or saw the movie, you will probably enjoy the book more. The book was well written and interesting anyway. I am debating whether to read the next book in the series. I wonder why science fiction writers do not change the basic human motivations and reactions in their characters a little more. Would such a book be very boring for the reader? I was always a fan of Mr. Spock of Star Trek. Does human evolution stop in the future?
B00005YXZH|5.0|I'd given this album a listen a few years ago, and while appreciative of it, it didn't stick, and so I returned it to the shelf from whence it came.  I've been a fan of Uncle Tupelo and listened to both Son Volt and Wilco's earlier efforts, but I just didn't get the attraction.    I recently popped it back into my CD player (yes, those things still exist) and now I can't get enough of it.  \\"Radio Cure\\" may be one of the most beautiful songs ever written, and \\"Poor Places\\" with its driving minor counterpoint is another one of my favorites.  The album is not one with only a few good tracks and is best enjoyed to as a whole.    My only fear is that I love it so much, I may over-listen and grow tired of hearing it.  Let's hope that doesn't happen.
B001AQR3E4|4.0|You blu ray owners that are whining about grain in movies on blu ray should educate yourselves on how the movie was shot to begin with. Time isn't always the culprit for lower quality films. This is why say One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest looks so rich and clean and this one doesn't. A lot of things play a factor, between the biggest which is type of film stock, camera, lenses, lighting. This movie was shot this way. What you are seeing is what was shot. It isn't because Warner is out to \\"get you\\". Trust me, they want to make consumers happy. They want good reviews so people will buy more of their products. It's not like Interview is a small title that they can just throw on an HD disc either. It's a shame the average consumer has this mentality, and if you are a high end movie collector, you should really start taking these things into consideration before posting a review. All in all this film looks great. And blow the other DVD transfers to pieces.
0307269752|2.0|\\"Among the best crime novels ever written\\" (from the back flap)? I don't think so.  Somewhere in there (538 pages, import paperback) there was maybe 200 pages of good crime/mystery.  Blomkvist and Salander are both engaging characters, and when they finally meet (at about page 300) the story takes off and doesn't let up until the resolution of Harriet's disappearance.  BUT, weighted down with the entire Vanger family history, way too much info about Wennerstrom (whom we never meet), all those Vanger relatives who ultimately have no impact on Harriet's story (not even as good red herrings, e.g., Harald), the terrific but totally wasted Dragan Armansky, and Salander's ridiculous \\"mission impossible\\" trip at the end, this story drops from a possible 4-star to 2-1/2 max stars for me.  And the plot holes (where do I start)-- a town so small that everybody sees everything but not the killer among them for 20 years?  The one townie (Suzanne at the cafe) who volunteers information about the family but is never interviewed?  Oh, and \\"the dragon tattoo\\"?  It's mentioned once in passing and has no relevance to the story.  Let's hope for a little tighter editing on the next installment.
B0001I55NS|5.0|I am not one who enjoys an action film. I did find myself drawn to this one though. It has charm and wonderful actors. There is twist's and turns throughout the film. My husband loved it so much that I decided to buy this for him. It's definately worth buying! It takes you through time but in a way that it differs from the rest of the \\"time traveling\\" films. It's the only one of it's kind and Would make a wonderful gift for anyone.
B000002UVZ|5.0|Like a lot of music fans, I have turned completely back to vinyl, and the versions of this GREAT album that I have found are all messed up.  I want Rhino to get the rights from IRS to allow them to do a great 180g pressing as they have done for some other great '80's records, with the  fantastic \\"Pleased to Meet Me\\" by the Replacements as an example.      I am not, nor ever was a huge REM fan, but I have always loved this album.  \\"Fall on Me\\" unlike a lot of '80's music still sounds as good to me today as it did as a sophmore in college.  As I have gotten older and sadly realized that the music from my generation paled in comparison to the one just before us, I take some consolation in the fact that we have a few winners.  Such as this album, Murmur, War and the Joshua Tree.  But let's be honest; REM and U2 are not Led Zeppelin, Black Sabbath, Fleetwood Mac, the Eagles, the Allman Bros, the Rolling Stones, Pink Floyd..... man the 70's sure had a long list of great bands.      Great album, btw.
1416594884|3.0|Unfortunately, John Le Carre has as many problems with modern asymmetrical warfare as do European and American intelligence and law enforcement agencies. Thankfully, his problems are limited to the literary world. There is much missing from Le Carre's classic Cold War novels.  He is also up against a very formidable spy novel standard; his own, established in his previous novels.       A young abused Chechen immigrant named Issa Karpov arrives illegally in Hamburg.  He has traveled to Hamburg from a Turkish prison through Sweden with the objective of obtaining an inheritance which he wishes to donate to Muslim charitable causes. He is at first housed by Melik and Leyla Otay, legal Turkish expatriates living in Hamburg.  Issa eventually is represented by Annabelle Richter, an idealistic lawyer working for a German organization dedicated to helping illegals.    Issa's inheritance is located at Tommy Brue's private bank in a special account.  Annabelle represents Issa in his approach to Brue.  Issa's illegal entry into Hamburg, however, has not gone unnoticed by German authorities.  Issa is suspected of being a terrorist or a tool of them.  One of Germany's best intelligence operatives, Gunther Bachman, has plans to use Issa to gather intelligence about unnamed Muslim terrorist fronts masquerading as Muslim charitable organizations in Germany.  This involves Issa's decision to use a local, well-respected Muslim imam to disperse the funds to appropriate charities.    Tommy Brue and Annabelle Richter are happy to help Issa claim his inheritance for different reasons.  This sets the scene for the inevitable clash between spy and law enforcement agencies after they learn of Issa's charitable intentions. Should arrests be made immediately or should certain people be run as agents in order to gain information on higher-ups?       Two of Le Carre's strengths that set him apart from other spy novelists are missing here.  First, there is not enough description of the city of Hamburg, the ambience of the private bank which Tommy Brue owns, the headquarters of the intelligence services or anything else.  In past Le Carre novel's description is all-important in setting the mood and tone. The lack of it in this novel detracts from the story.    The second element missing is the depth of characterization that would provide the reader an insight or clue to their eventual actions.  This failure also deprives the reader of the ability to empathize with any of them.  This may be due to the unnecessary plethora of characters introduced in this story unlike Le Carre's other novels which focus on a few people, in depth.  Read \\"The Spy Who Came in from the Cold\\" in comparison.       The most obvious example of weak characterization is the American spies. In past Le Carre novels CIA agents were portrayed as overstaffed and overly obsessed with gadgetry in any intelligence operation. This was a credible criticism of the CIA's overreliance on technology at the expense of running live agents.  However, in \\"A Most Wanted Man\\" the Americans are incredibly conceived caricatures; evil, foaming-at-the-mouth amateurs and thugs as fanatically ideological as any terrorist.    Le Carre's lack of knowledge of Muslim countries and culture are marked when compared with his knowledge of the old Soviet Union.  Like the Americans the Muslim imam is portrayed without much depth and the treatment of Islam and the tenets of Muslim charity are superficial at best.  Melik and Leyla Otay go to Turkey for a wedding and never reappear even though a number of chapters are used to develop their relationship with Issa.  It is curious why Le Carre even introduced Melik and Leyla.      The secret bank account which Tommy Brue inherited from his father at their private bank is a good vehicle to bring the various characters and agents to the same place at the same time in order to end the story.  The ending, however, is neither remarkable nor exciting.

0307455378|5.0|Una vez empiezas esta novela, es difícil parar de leer. El libro está escrito en un lenguaje sencillo y de acción rápida - de una sorpresa a la otra.   La descripción de Barcelona y sus alrededores pone al lector en el centro de la acción. El lector sigue el personaje principal a través de sus desventuras e intrigas para culminar en un final que, lejos de explicar el misterio, deja muchas de las historias sujetas a la interpretación del lector.    Este libro lo deja pensando y atando sus propios cabos.  Merece una segunda lectura.
B000056VJ7|5.0|Great remix of most of Meat Loaf's best songs.  Good to prepare for upcoming concert tour.
B000FVBMWE|5.0|the last record from the greatest ever..!! and a fitting end ! there is not one song on this record that is not worth listening to again and again!
B000HEWEDK|4.0|This is one of the best SciFi movies of all time (#1 being \\"The Day The Earth Stood Still\\"). Based (loosely) on Shakespeare's play \\"The Tempest\\", it brings together an outstanding cast (look at the cast list) to tell the story of genius ultimately controlled, then destroyed, by the \\"mindless primitive\\". The special effects are astounding; espcially for the time. I find the electronic music to be sometimes distracting and there are places where it's impossible to tell if the sound you are hearing is a monster, wind in the rocks, or the soundtrack.  The movie, with its award winning special effects and soundtrack and its fine cast of actors appears to be quite rough in places (more on that later) but this is the way the movie was made. The acting is quite good. Walter Pidgeon is perfect as Morbius. Leslie Nielsen as Adams does a credible job in a dramatic role (but you can't help slipping to \\"Naked Gun\\"). I won't run down the rest of the cast except to say that Earl Holliman is, at best, light comedic relief; I could never figure out why he was really in this movie.    The disc set containts the movie, specials, and trailers on one disc with \\"The Invisible Boy\\" (which I have not yet seen) on the second. One special is a set of \\"lost\\" footage which is really a set of test shots of scenery but which is really quite interesting (watch as the camera moves around the planet and note that it looks like you are really circling a planet and not looking at a prop)    The other special contains scenes that were shot but not part of the original release. A couple of notes here. There is one scene of Adams dressing down three of his officers just after the communications officer is killed. The disc has that as a deleted scene and it is missing from the movie on this disc but that scene is included in every version of this movie I have ever seen. Another deleted scene is the \\"unicorn explanation\\" that I have never seen but that perfectly explains why Altaira has the affinity for animals that she does and why the tiger must later be killed. I had already surmised the reason but this was the actual confirmation (after 50 years!!). There is also a scene that seems to be rewritten on the disc (where Morbius asks Altaira to deny her love for Adams. When I watched the disc she just stands there but I recall her as saying something to the effect \\"No, not even if I could\\").    One of the specials also describes how the movie was apparently left roughly cut to rush it to general release instead of waiting for a finished product.  I'd always wondered why there were obvious cuts in the film; now I know.    I bought this set to fill in my collection of great, old, classic, SciFi films. And, while I have seen the film at least 50 times, I still enjoy it and I still see something interesting in the special effects or the sets. It's worth getting.
B000ICM5IK|4.0|If you love the Rocky series, and the music, you'll definitely enjoy this CD! It has classics like 'Gonna Fly Now' and 'Eye of the Tiger' It also has the gangsta' rap song 'It's a Fight' by the Three 6 Mafia! I highly recommend THE BEST OF ROCKY!!!

B0013FSL3E|4.0|The first 40 (or so) minutes of this film are a wonder. There is no point in trying to describe it, you have to see it. It is above and beyond criticism. Chaplin and Keaton (whom the eponymous character resembles) would have loved it.<br /><br />The rest of the film bothers me, which is why I've given it only four stars. I do this because Pixar takes its storytelling very, very seriously, and I see no reason not to critique it accordingly.<br /><br />The idea that a lazy, poorly educated humanity that has been pampered for 700 years would want -- or even be willing -- to return to Earth, to restore it, is not plausible. A single century, during which the original population and its direct memories of Earth, would have passed on, would have been sufficient time. That was all the time the inhabitants of North America needed to realize they were Americans, not British citizens.<br /><br />The \\"moral\\" of the film -- that people can and must stand on their own two feet, and lead their own lives -- is a good one. But had I been directing it, I would have had the humans continue their pointless lives on the Axiom, with WALL-E and EVE returning alone to Earth. The film appeals to what we would like to think about ourselves, not how we really are.<br /><br />I am also obliged to criticize the film's almost overwhelming intensity, particularly during the last half. It moves along at near-breakneck speed, with no ebb and flow, no slackening so that one might build up to an even greater intensity (psychologically, if not literally). Beethoven and Wagner understood this. Andrew Stanton does not.<br /><br />There's a wonderful Twinkies joke, so good it's done twice. Note the absolutely adorable (there's no other word for it) way it's handled the second time. (Pixar tends not to shove things in the viewer's face, so you might miss it.)<br /><br />There are many factual and scientific errors (WALL-E plays a VHS tape in U-matic machine; there is no up and down and space to reference artificial gravity to), but these do not significantly detract from this film's appeal.<br /><br />The entire film is worth seeing once, but I suspect many adult purchasers will, on repeat viewings, shut off the player when WALL-E reaches the Axiom. But this film is nevertheless a remarkable achievement.icantly detract from this film's appeal.

B001ACH4DS|5.0|I remember my initial reaction to David Cook on American Idol earlier this year and it was pretty lukewarm.  Little by little I warmed to his style and personality and ended up solidly in this David's camp.  Now that I have heard his first CD I know I chose wisely.  He is still searching a little for his style but what he has given us here is real and mostly very good.  I love the musicality of Bar-Ba-Sol, the lyrics and the beat stick in your head - and it is different, quite different.  Lie is my next favorite-who has not found themselves in that situation at some time or another.  Let me live my fantasy just a little longer so just look me in the eyes and lie, lie, lie!!  Yes David, well said.  And of course Permanent just breaks your heart and seriously shows off the full range of his beautiful voice.  I recommend it to everyone of all ages and musical preferences--I am sure you will find something you like, I know I did!

B001M5UDGS|5.0|This is a DVD of Doctor Horrible's Sing-along blog. A fun little musical that hit the internet in the Summer of 2008.  The story revolves around the anti-hero Dr. Horrible (played by Neil Patrick Harris) and his Nemesis, the 'Good' Captain Hammer (played by Nathan Fillion). Both end up vying for the same woman (Felicia Day) while Dr. Horrible tries to gain entry into the Evil League of Evil.  Assorted henchmen appear periodically to align Dr. Horrible's goals and to sing some catchy little tunes.     I have not yet seen the DVD but am pre-ordering it. I did see the video as it was released on the Internet. I am purchasing the DVD for the extra things being put into it.  Joss Whedon is known for the extra content in his DVD releases and I am sure this is no exception. The story about how the making of this Internet released musical would also be worth it.    A contest was posted on the Evil League of Evil website stating that 10 fan based videos would be placed in the DVD.  Over 1000 applications to the Evil League of Evil entries were posted. I am interested in the outcome.

B000H0MKOC|3.0|\\"Thank You For Smoking\\" is a movie about suckers. Suckers who are willing to forgo every piece of information available as long as they have one person telling them what they want to believe is right, as long as it's what they want to hear. Into this void steps Nick Naylor (Adam Eckhart), a lobbyist for Big Tobacco, whose job is convincing everyone to take a rolled up tube of paper stuffed with carcinogens, set it on fire and suck the fumes into your body because you have the right to do so. Naylor is the best in the biz, making everyone around him take pratfalls while he tries to be a good dad to his precocious son (unfortunately a clich&eacute;d part, played up by Cameron Bright).<br /><br />While predominantly a satire on spin and the gullibility of consumers, \\"Thank You For Smoking\\" often misses the bulls-eye for the very thing its premise is based on: SPIN. No-one in the movie smokes. Even the wizened old Patriarch of the firm (played great by Robert Duvall) never lights one up, even as he tells everyone about his great discoveries. Naylor is momentarily seen fidgeting with an empty pack, but that's as close as it gets. It gets difficult to believe the bleating about being too PC when everyone in the film as politically correct as they can be. Even Katie Holmes, as a sleazy journalist, gets one-upped by the ever cunning Naylor.<br /><br />This is a deep and darkly funny film, but it just doesn't go far enough. The best film in this genre, the Political Satire [[ASIN:0780622561 Wag the Dog]], both hit the funny bone and slugged your gut, while TYFS pulls the final punches after about 2/3's of the way in by taking away Naylor's smarminess and turning him into a Disney Dad. Satire can be outrageous, but there also has to be an endgame. The feel-good ending here seems tacked on rather than thought through. It was fun watching Nick spar with the hapless Senator (William H. Macy, delightful as always), but had his name been something less convoluted than Ortolan Finistirre, it might have been less of an obvious ploy. (Ooo look! All American Lobbyist takes on nerdy Gov-Wonk with dopey name!)<br /><br />\\"Thank You For Smoking\\" wussed out when it really could've taken the Spin-Zone to task. Otherwise, it might have been the dark comedy it wanted to be. By trying to have it both ways, however, it simply goes up in smoke.been less of an obvious ploy. (Ooo look!

B000002LOE|4.0|The first voice you hear on R.E.M.'s second album for Warner Brothers wasn't even a member of the band. Rapper KRS-1 asks a question about what's on the radio before Michael Stipe intones \\"The world is collapsing around our ears.\\" If that didn't give you notice that something was up in the R.E.M. camp, then Bill Berry taking lead on \\"Near Wild Heaven\\" and two more songs should have. Then there is the matter of the international hot single, \\"Losing My Religion,\\" which feature lead instrument is a...Mandolin!?!<br /><br />\\"Out Of Time\\" was the sound of a band that, having hit its stride, was no longer content just to do what was automatically expected of it. The expanded line-up (including frequent touring buddy Peter Holsapple of [[ASIN:B000E112KW The dB's]] on guitar) both fleshed out the band's sound and pushed it away from its core jangle-pop. The second big hit, the Kate Pierson assisted \\"Shiny Happy People\\" was an irony free unabashed pop-song (even with its slowed down break for strings). The band may have eventually tried to disown the song, but stands as one of the band's most unaffected. (Kate showed up later for \\"Me In Honey,\\" one of the album's lesser songs.)<br /><br />While \\"Out of Time\\" was R.E.M.'s most experimental album, it is also a disc more noteworthy for its sounds than for its songs. The final trio of \\"Texarkana,\\" \\"Country Feedback\\" and \\"Me In Honey\\" are weak. The oddest thing about that statement is that \\"Texarkana\\" is the closest song to match the older R.E.M. of the [[ASIN:B000001I0G Reckoning]] days of Byrds-ian pop. It saps the album of its drive, robbing \\"Out Of Time\\" of a fifth star. But offered as the middle chapter between [[ASIN:B0006IIPEY Green]] and [[ASIN:B0006ICF9K Automatic for the People]], it shines in the period where R.E.M. was at both a commercial and creative peak.

0525457585|5.0|Years ago I inattentively watched the (first) movie of this on TV and found it too cute by half. This put me off reading the book for years. One weekend I happened to have a copy by me, so I picked it up and began to read. After 3-4 pages I wasn't that impressed. After 10-12 pages I was absolutely hooked.<br /><br />When I had finished it, I stood up, sighed, put the book down on the chair, and felt a kind of startlement like being struck with a bucket of cold water. I looked down, picked up the book again, glanced at the cover... then  I sat down and began to read it all over again. When I was through, the process repeated and I read it a third time. This is the only time in my life I have ever read a book three times in a row uninterruptedly.<br /><br />Does anyone out there still need to be told that this is one of the best books ever written, and that not having read it is a truly tragic deprivation, like not liking music or never having eaten strawberries? If so, consider yourself told.<br />It is one of those rare children's classics that can be read by anyone, of any age. Once you've read it, you can no longer imagine the Universe without it. You don't feel that Michael Ende ever needed to write it; you feel that he must have just Found it somewhere.<br /><br />His inventiveness is limitless, stupefying: enough material here for dozens of ordinary children's books. Certain scenes, like the part halfway through about the lion Grograman and the Night Forest Perilin, are so truly astonishing that you're left at a loss, not merely for words but for anything at all: your mouth hangs open and your mind goes blank.<br /><br />At the same time this is the most profound investigation ever made into what a Story is, and what Imagination is, their value and their dangers. Just when you think the author has gone as far as he'll dare, he goes further, then even further, and then still further. At least one copy of this wonderful book should be in every home.

B001H5X7I4|3.0|The '08 release `Tropic Thunder' is an outrageous comedy about an inept film crew and cast who travel to Vietnam to make a relevant, contemporary war film.  Ben Stiller does his usual brainless, narcissistic stud routine, Jack Black his flatulent, highbrow material and Michael Downey Jr. portrays his usual articulate, sardonic self. This analysis of the acting styles of these three immensely popular performers is not intended to anger their fan base or denigrate their thespian abilities, I'm just pointing out that the three are doing what they do best.<br /><br />The storyline moves quickly with lots of hilarious moments and memorable one-liners you'll probably use later on your friends. It also parodies a couple of classic Vietnam films, my personal favorite `Apocalypse Now' and `Platoon', which was well worth a laugh or two. There are some moments that one might find offensive but the overall comedic value of the film still makes it an enjoyable evening of entertainment.<br /><br />My Rating: -3 1/2 Stars-.
B001DDBCUA|1.0|Having enjoyed the television series, I was afraid, from all the hype, that the movie would be a big disappointment. Well, I couldn't have been more right. The thing that makes the TV series work is that the friendship among the women is stronger than anything else; all the superficial stuff is just icing. In the movie, the strongest thing is the massive assault of designer label product placement; it's all superficial stuff and nothing else. It's like one long, annoying commercial. And by the way, the movie is all Carrie all the time; Charlotte, Miranda, and Samantha -- far more interesting characters -- have almost nothing to do. The men are beyond an afterthought. The movie is also bizarrely, gratuitously crass. I almost walked out of the theatre. Beyond a dud, this movie is offensive to human intelligence. I hear they're making another.... yikes.

I can't think of a single track that seems out of place or weaker than the others. I'm glad I purchased this CD. You definitely have to be a person that likes traditional R & B, this album is not Pop music.

B00005JOFQ|5.0|Brand new movie. Looks like from the store \\"new\\", which is good. The shipping box was small and compact, environmentally friendly, not like the other huge packets I've received before with my previous orders. Despite the size of the packet, my item was not damaged at all, so don't worry. The shipping service was fast, so really really good.
B001LRICM4|5.0|I can't believe how great this show keeps getting.  And they don't drag a storyline out season after season with a bunch of questions and no answers.  LOVE IT.
B001DTPZNY|1.0|I'm heartbroken by this movie, because the original trilogy is so good and so fun, but this might actually be the worst movie I've ever seen.  Just so bad on so many levels.  Right from the start, it just didn't \\"feel\\" like an Indiana Jones movie.  I kept trying to like it, but the action was so silly and the ending was so dumb.  Ask my wife, I was actually angry after I saw this movie, just so disappointed at what LUCAS did to this.  Thanks for ruining ANOTHER great movie franchise, George.
0307455874|4.0|This book is highly intellectual. Insights are very deep. I would just like to add a few things:    One has to view the race obsession lightly, it is not always someone's experience.   Obama is a wise man who himself has come to these conclusions - policies that are for everyone's good or are at least viewed that way will always be supported more than policies targeted at a community, as this tends to isolate or make individuals guilty.
B00003CWNR|5.0|The story line on this film isn't funny or have necessarily a happy ending...or not that much. But it does touch your heart with a message about finding your own life, goals even if that means leaving everything that has been your whole life with nothing but a bit of clothes and food for the road.<br /><br />It's raw, harsh and even tough to swollow, but nevertheless, a great film with a HUGE cast (left aside that Charlize Theron is the most beautiful woman in the world, and is half naked here) performing brilliantly in a story that narrates an orphan's life who grew up helping the resident doctor in performing abortions and decides to give up his life to find his true destiny which leads him to hop on a journey with a couple which had gone to have an abortion, and lead to an apple farm. Deception, morale issues, passionate love, forbidden love, sadness, happiness and many many moments to capture and take to your heart will make you watch this movie more than once for sure. Must by DVD.
031606792X|4.0|First of all, let me say that this is not a fangirl's perspective. My little sister (who is 12) asked me to take her to see the Twilight movie and this is the first I heard about the series. I'm ten years older than her and thought the book and the movie would be terribly childish but possibly fun. I read Twilight before going to the film and I have to say, I was somewhat impressed. It was a bit juvenile and the sappy romance was a bit hard to swallow, but overall, Edward was just adorable and Bella's stupidity and self-deprecating nature were endearing.    New Moon is my favorite book and you can see my review over there for why.    I am so glad that this series became more than Edward/Bella. It would have bored me to tears if it had all been star-crossed romance. Having said that, of course I depended on the fact that in the end, Edward/Bella would prevail. I love Jacob, loved Jacob's point of view in Breaking Dawn--it was so funny and painful, much as teenage unrequited love is in reality. I was impressed with the fact that imprinting has little to do with age. A lot of people think it's creepy but I mean, really? Eating mountain lions and ripping people to pieces isn't?     Granted, this book's plot was weaker than the first. It had a lot of really well written SCENES, though. Bella's \\"death\\" was heartwrenchingly graphic and emotional.    This is worth reading; it's fun but still thought-provoking. Still my least favorite book because it all got tied up in a neat little bow. Stephenie Meyer is no Lois Lowry; but these young adult novels really entertained this older adult.    One last wistful thought: I really wish Bella had been a clumsy vampire.

B001GQSY5U|4.0|Three and a half stars for this one.<br /><br />- 1st battle droid (during a heavy skirmish): \\"Concentrate fire on sector 11374265!\\"<br />- 2nd battle droid: \\"One, one, three... seven... What was that again?\\"<br /><br />For a bit now, I've nursed a mad-on at George Lucas and his bungling of the Star Wars universe. But, in retrospect and after some years removed, the Star Wars prequel trilogy doesn't quite seem as awful as I thought (although Jar Jar Binks - grrrr!). [[ASIN:B00005JLXH Star Wars - Episode III, Revenge of the Sith (Widescreen Edition)]] went a long way to atoning for some of the sabotage done. Anyway, given that Lucas had already jumped the shark in a galaxy far, far away, I still wanted to approach STAR WARS: THE CLONE WARS with a less prejudiced perspective, and this mindset pays off. Thanks to my super power of compartmentalizing, I actually had a good time watching this animated feature.<br /><br />Chronologically, STAR WARS: THE CLONE WARS takes place between [[ASIN:B00006HBUJ Star Wars - Episode II, Attack of the Clones (Widescreen Edition)]] and EPISODE III: REVENGE OF THE SITH. It also sets the stage for the new STAR WARS: THE CLONE WARS animated television series on the Cartoon Network. As the movie opens, the Republic is at war with the Separatists. Even as Obi-Wan Kenobi is charged with negotiating a safe passage treaty with the galactic crime lord, Jabba the Hutt, who controls the Outer Rim shipping routes, Anakin Skywalker and his new, enthusiastic Padawan learner, Ahsoka Tano, go on a mission to rescue Jabba's abducted baby. Of course, this is exactly what the traitorous Count Dooku is counting on.<br /><br />The vast leaps in moviemaking f/x seem to have an adverse effect in Lucas's storytelling ability. As one improves, the other degenerates. There's no escaping that THE CLONE WARS is strictly vanilla. It takes on the sensibilities of those old matinee serial movies, meaning that it's mostly a series of non-stop action sequences stretching out a bare bones plot. Basically, it's platoon after platoon of battle droids getting smashed, with the film occasionally breaking away to feature lightsaber throwdowns. Obviously pandering more towards younglings, it's no surprise that the movie feels shallow and that character development is quickly defenestrated. And, although the film serves to fill in some gaps during the Clone Wars, nothing really significant crops up to contribute to the Star Wars mythos. Not to mention, John Williams' classic theme score is woefully neglected. But, okay, for what it is, the film is nicely done and it succeeds on its objective, which is to draw in an audience for the then upcoming television cartoon series. For older Star Wars geeks, THE CLONE WARS is something to watch with the brain on park. I cringed a bit, though, during the opening moments, when that newsy voice-over goes into its monologue, ala STARSHIP TROOPERS.<br /><br />Huge chunks of screen time are given to Anakin and his spirited 14-year-old apprentice. They make a hotheaded duo, and their constant, infantile bickerings serve to undermine the film, but, again, the kids will probably beg to differ. I shudder each time Ahsoka refers to Anakin as \\"Sky Guy\\" (he calls her \\"Snips\\"), although that's just another element of their older brother/younger sister dynamics.<br /><br />Although many relevant characters from the live action films appear, it's disconcerting that so few of the original actors lend their voices to this film. In Hayden Christensen's case, this is probably a good thing, as less of him equates to fewer apoplexies suffered by the viewers. Samuel J. Jackson, Christopher Lee and Anthony Daniels do show up, and their voices are invaluable. The CG animation here is angular and stylized. In its look, it veers away from the animation style of the 2003 CLONE WARS television micro-series (see [[ASIN:B0006Z2LMO Star Wars - Clone Wars, Vol. 1]]). In a way, it more resembles the marionette style of those 1960s Thunderbirds shows, although, thankfully, the animation here is much, much more fluid. It's no Pixar material, but I kinda dug it.<br /><br />Boil it down? STAR WARS: THE CLONE WARS offers a subpar story but sort of makes up for it with pretty cool battle sequences and decent animation. I even grew fond of Ahsoka Tano, who, in her eagerness and recklessness, is much like Anakin when he was younger. Probably why they end up getting along. As usual, there's that blend of panoramic space opera and Jedi mysticism. Death rays and magic swords. And the battle robots get the funniest lines.<br /><br />But what happens to Ahsoka Tano that we don't see her in REVENGE OF THE SITH? Or did I miss something?s Thunderbirds shows, although, thankfully, the animation here is much, much more fluid. It's no Pixar material, but I kinda dug it.<br /><br />Boil it down?

B000GIW43M|5.0|These days in many Critical Reading examinations, passages that require the understanding of other cultures (i.e. the African-Americans and the Japanese-Americans) are often found. Entering an American college within two years myself, I asked for suggestions of books that issue cultural conflicts in America - at last, I came up with a hard-back book covered with dragons and clouds with \\"New York Times Bestseller list\\" in bold letters.    Personally with an Asian background (Korea), this book was more than engaging to my life at home and my life tangent to the western culture. Is America flawlessly opened to accept new cultures? If it wasn't for Amy Tan doing an excellent job by fitting in the billions of characteristics of her topic, beliefs, marriage values, changes in America and their life back in China, she would not have succeeded in smashing the brick of race and won her top place leaving behind many other American talented writers.    Although my interpretation and my comprehension of this book may differ to those of American readers due to my Asian background, I'm sure that the heart-touching feeling I received won't differ with any other readers of this book.  The book's title says it all. The Joy Luck Club is club where four Chinese women play the Chinese block-game \\"Majong\\" and tell stories of their own, regardless of how long the story is. One of the four women dies recently and the daughter, Jing-Mei Woo, replaces the empty spot. When Jing-Mei joins the other three women, she finds her true identity and is given with a request that her mother couldn't accomplish before death - finding her real sisters back in China, raised by her mother's first husband.   Typically, the story ends with the reunion of Jing-Mei and her sisters in China. Wait, I'm giving away the ending for a reason! The true inspiration of this book is revealed through the individual stories of each of the characters - and these stories are so peculiar and new that the value of it is beyond those of any other books in the world.    The first part of the book deals with stories of the mothers' lives back in China and to the point how they came to America. The second part, interestingly, deals with the stories of their daughters' lives in America. The mothers believe that they had raised their daughters in a westernized way, but its funny to see that there are parts where they cannot avoid forcing an aspect of Chinese culture in their daughters.    As you read the book, you will realize how old generations are getting reconstructed by the new generations. For example, there is a scene where her American boy friend's tells Jing-Mei Woo mother that her and the family's reputation might destruct because of their son's Asian background girlfriend.    The book is like a portal to another universe. The cute blend of the mothers' wants and their daughters' wants in a non-American culture gives an insight of how things are changing today.

B0002DB52M|1.0|Oh - what a waste of time, talent, and money.  This odious production had such great potential, but it fails on so many levels, I won't bother to elaborate.<br /><br />I don't know you, but trust me, there is a 99.5% chance you won't like this film - honestly.
B001F290E4|5.0|I haven't even bought the CD yet, and I'm blown away... I just watched the 2 videos on this music site of \\"A Change is Gonna Come\\" and \\"If you Don't Know me By Now\\".  Seal is sounding so beautiful, as always, he just gives me chills.  This'll be the very next CD I buy :)

B001EOQWFI|5.0|There are plenty of reviews already written about the movie itself, so I have nothing more to add about that.    BUT, the benefit of getting this 3-disc blu ray set over the 2-disc is that you get the extra \\"disc copy\\" disc.  This disc goes into your PC or Mac, and it allows you to download the entire movie digitally through iTunes or windows media player.  I chose iTunes.  So if we don't feel like watching Wall-E on my plasma through my ps3, I can opt to open up iTunes on my non-blu ray PC and watch it in my room.  Plus, I have now synced Wall-E to my iPhone so that if my son gets bored while we're out, I can keep him entertained!
B000VI6T6U|5.0|Yes, I have to say that this Hendrix performance is quire possibly the finest live performance I have ever purchased. Most certainly, watching Jimi do his thing for the first time in America, \\"Pulling all the stops,\\" as Jimi put it, is a treat for the heart and soul of true rockers. This DVD is necessary for those who love Hendrix, but most importantly, Hendrix's Monterey performance is for those who need a lesson on Rock's finest hour. Buy it for yourself. Buy it for a friend. Buy it for a youngster who needs some rock and roll education. Two thumbs way up!
B001GJOL22|4.0|I hated the RIo dvd so much that I thought of boycotting Rush! Horrible sound, camera angles that shifted every 2 secs as if editing was done by someone with adhd...

Snakes in Blue ray looks wonderful! I just got it yesterday with a blu ray machine and it is like being at the concert again. Only complaints are that the atlanta bootlegs look a bit contrasty, but other wise, it is a good  disc, lots of music. Oh, for those who wish they did \\"Time stand Still\\", when I saw them do it in concert ('90?), it wasn't that great-Getty sang with Manns voice piped in over the speakers while you saw ariel footage of canadian forest on the video screen. \\"Witchunt\\" was a way better choice and heck, \\"Natural Science\\" was awesome as well.

0684803356|4.0|This is my third experience with Hemingway, and while I fully expect to complete the entire Hemingway collection, I can't quite find it within myself to award five stars to any of the works I've read to date.<br /><br />In each of the novels (The Sun Also Rises and Farewell to Arms being the other two) I've been entranced at times by the hauntingly beautiful writing, however there have been periods where the story drags, where the almost stream of consciousness style grinds the action to a halt.  Not long enough to kill the story, but enough to impact the overall reading experience.<br /><br />This novel is set in Spain, during the Spanish Civil War, the idealogical precursor to the Fascist/Communist clash soon to come on the Eastern Front of World War II.  The story primarily involves American Spanish professor and converted Republican partisan, Robert Jordan and the 72 hours he spends with an anti-fascist partisan force in the hours preceding a Republican offensive.<br /><br />The characters crafted by Hemingway are fascinating, most specifically the partisan leaders Pablo and Pilar.  The interaction between the rebels and with Jordan are spellbinding.  The character of Pilar is especially haunting and her story of the execution of the fascists (a/k/a prominent citizens) in her small Spanish village is some of the best and most captivating writing I've ever read.<br /><br />Unfortunately, in my opinion, this 470 page novel is about 100 pages too long, as it is interspersed with periods of inaction, punctuated by stream of consciousness meanderings, which admittedly many may find enjoyable.<br /><br />Some may find the style of language irritating (Thee, Thou, Thy mother, etc.) but I found this to be a minor issue.  More problematic to me is what I can only guess is the censorship (either self censorship in light of the times or editorial censorship) whereby all instances of profanity or coarse language is omitted and replaced by bizarre alternatives.  For example, these beauties from the mouth of Pablo, \\"I obscenity in the milk of all,\\" and \\"Go and obscenity thyself.\\"  I find it hard to believe that Hemingway actually wrote this, and if not (or even if he did), these bizarre omissions cannot be rectified.<br /><br />Despite these minor complaints, this is an extremely educational piece of work, both from the standpoint of literature and for the insight it provides for an extremely important and interesting period of world history.  Highly recommended., \\"I obscenity in the milk of all,\\" and \\"Go and obscenity thyself.\\"  I find it hard to believe that Hemingway actually wrote this, and if not (or even if he did), these bizarre omissions cannot be rectified.

0375701427|5.0|I understand that a movie version of AMERICAN PASTORAL is in production. Great novels are difficult to make into great movies. Roth, who has written several great novels does not translate well to the screen. Interior action has primacy in a book and is near impossible to replicate in a movie. Roth is a wordsmith of the highest order. Each sentence is crafted with a flair and precision that raise the novel not merely through thematic content, but in terms of aesthetics, to a high artistic standard. A major theme of AMERICAN PASTORAL and several other Roth books is helplessness..the futility of trying to control one's destiny. This futility, which inevitably leads to anger, and can lead to hopelessness, and personal disintegration, is due to circumstances beyond one's control. Those circumstances can be either internally or externally generated. One can be a slave to one's own passions and obsessions (Mickey Sabbath in SABBATH'S THEATER), or as in the case of Seymour Levov in AMERICAN PASTORAL, an innocent victim of societal whim, a leaf blown off a tree called the American Dream, and swept off into a terrifying unknown. Written with masterful prose, laced with cynicism, humor, bitterness, and rage, AMERICAN PASTORAL is a great novel. Philip Roth has a distinct style, insight, and sensibility that sets him apart from most of the writers of his generation. He has the ability to present historical events in a new light, with passion and style, through a unique personal vision.
B000F9RB9Y|3.0|This review refers to the BLU-RAY edition ONLY and NOT to the DVD edition.     Well having The Terminitor series on DVD and loving them and having recently upgraded to a blu-ray player I decided to take the plunge and upgrade my collection to high definition blu-ray format.     Boy, what a mistake that was.     Picture quality is AWFUL - well awful for blu-ray anyway. They've taken the same standard definition source as the DVD and upscaled it for blu-ray - but it's still standard definition. Only the menu is in High Definition, the movie is not. I tested my DVD version upscaled against the blu-ray edition and found them identical - if anything the DVD came out slightly on top.     It also only contains 2 extras - the special effects making of and the retrospective - nothing else. My DVD edition contains over a dozen extras.     My verdict if you're thinking of buying The Terminator in blu-ray and you have an upscaling DVD/BD player - forget it. Stick with the DVD version instead, picture is the same and it has more extras. It's cheaper too.     Maybe one day this wonderful movie will receive the treatment it deserves and be digitally remastered and have it's frames scanned with a high definition camera - but until then sit on your DVD's and wait.
B001C46P2A|4.0|Baz Luhrmann's \\"Australia\\" is one of the big movie events of the 2008 Holiday Season.  The movie has a pretty basic girl meets boy, girl overcomes challenges to have a happy ending with boy, storyline, but Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman make the story come alive.  Like all Baz Luhrmann films, Australia is shot in a visually stunning fantasy world, but unlike Baz's earlier films, Australia is a true epic, with the scenery to back it up.<br /><br />Australia lacks some trademarks of earlier Luhrmann films--there are no psychedelic trips or fast camera cuts here--but his vision is still apparent.  There are some things lacking in the film--the storyline could have been more developed, and the end of the movie feels out of place with the rest of the narrative.  But overall, I really enjoyed this movie, and I would certainly say it's one of the best I've seen so far this year.  I would recommend this movie to people who love old epic films--you will certainly enjoy this ode to old hollywood film making.

I'm thrilled that a Marine Officer friend of mine hasn't seen it and will do so now thanks to me; his wingnut friend. Thanks USMC and I'll even say thanks HBO.

B001C08RHA|4.0|Robert Downey Jr. makes the movie for sure - he plays his character to a \\"T\\".  There is a reasonable amount of Iron Man action, but much of the movie seems to be setting up the sequel.  I agree with one reviewer's comments regarding the not-so-subtle political message in the film that powerful people in the business of making weapons delight in conflict and will create conflict if none exist to maximize their profits and power (\\"evil war mongering capitalists\\" versus patriots with a desire for freedom to triumph over tyranny).  Contrasted with Batman, The Dark Knight, in my opinion a better (albeit disturbing) movie - the notion of inherent evil is recognized as a force to be battled with unyielding courage, strength, and ingenuity.    Tony Stark is confronted with the fact that that up close - war is a dirty business and when advanced weapons fall into the hands of ruthless people with a lust to control others - harm will come to innocents.  In his subsequent conversion to a less capitalistic humanitarian - eschewing the advancement of weapons to wage war and the profits that follow - he manages in a twist of irony to invent a weapon more deadly then anything he's ever created.     Overall, it's a very good film - good cinematography, special effect, action, acting, and story.  On the down-side: as a family movie, I would have preferred that the gratuitous sex scene was implied vs. demonstrated (I realize it was relevant to develop Tony's character);  a fairly large portion of the action was Tony perfecting his suit vs. battling villains; and, I would have preferred a less trite portrayal of the defense industry and scientists.    Hopefully, the sequel will get down to the business of heroic action battling evil.

B001GKJ2DO|5.0|What can I say other than the music created by the Swedish musical group nearly 40 years ago is simply to be treasured by all ages.  I love ABBA music and waited years for the popular musical Mamma Mia to make it to the big screen and now Mamma Mia on DVD.  I have never been a huge fan of Meryl Streep but she gives a wonderful virtuoso performance in this movie.  Same for newcomer Amanda Seyfried.  Neither actress is known for their singing ability, but are simply messmerizing in Mamma Mia.  ABBA's music is timeless and pure joy in this romantic lost and found musical love story.  If you look hard one of the original members of ABBA has a cameo in the movie; one of the two \\"BB\\" (Bjorn ans Benny) in the sensational signing group's name.  The on location photography is beautiful in this movie as the story unfolds.  The only fairly deserved criticism is the signing of the leading man (aka 007).  Pierce Bronsan is way below par compared to the rest of the cast, but still nails his character's (dramatic) performance in this who's who of a Father-Daughter-Mother love story.  If you've seen the play, the story is still the same, if not a bit over the top.  Still, the signing and even the dancing in the movie version is just as entertaining and enjoyable to the audience.  One thing for sure this movie cries out to be HEARD, so turn up the volume and delight in all the stirring melodies and lyrical music of ABBA.  This DVD will make you feel good to be alive, and best enjoyed by singing along.  Why not?  Celebrate the music of Mamma Mia!

This post-breakup album is definitely on a par with those, although many of the songs involve processing of the fallout from her recent divorce, so if you're not in the mood to hear anything about love gone wrong, this is not the album to play.  If that doesn't bother you, the songs are well written, many are uptempo, others slower and more heartfelt, but all worth riding to.  Rock on!

Right from the word go Robert is filling you with tons of information, skill, and knowledge about what is good code. He doesn't mix any words, letting you know immediately that you will spend some time with this book, it took me almost two weeks to work my way through with a great understanding of the concepts in this book.<br /><br />I don't want to scare anyone, this book is really important for any coder to read. I will be suggesting it to my employers from now on as a required reading for our developers. The concepts are sound, solid, and make sense. There is no voodoo in this book, and nothing that doesn't come from a great deal of working with code.<br /><br />Clean Code has the ability to turn any good coder into a great coder, and build teams into better coding machines.<br /><br />Robert explains the best techniques if factoring code so that it will be easiest to read, and refactor. If the tips, tricks, and suggestions are followed then any coder would be able to follow in your footsteps and enjoy maintaining your code.<br /><br />There is nothing too outrageous in Clean Code, but instead is a good explanation of why you should code the way we were taught. If you weren't taught to code well, then you really owe it to the coders in your wake to come and read this book.

The lyrics for Debbie's unfinished poem from which the title came show the first three lines out of order (it should read, \\"the lines on the pages, the lines on the screen, the lines I have written that you read between...\\")<br /><br />There are only 2 or 3 photos from the outtakes for the cover picture--aside from these the opportunities for an exciting booklet appear to have been wasted. The back cover picture by Roberta Bayley is a live shot from 1979--when Debbie was playing the shaggy-haired rock goddess, as opposed to the more retro and vampy pop siren of \\"Parallel Lines\\". Can't we keep the eras straight?<br /><br />Lest I sound nitpicky, I'll get to some of the good aspects of this disc. The sound quality is great, just as good as  (but no better than) the 2001 remaster. There are some good bonus tracks, most notably the all-French \\"Sunday Girl\\", although I have to say the mix on this song is vastly inferior to the one available on \\"Once More Into the Bleach\\", which boasts much higher fidelity coupled with a brighter vocal mix on Debbie. When the song fades with Debbie's forlorn \\"I got the blu-u-u-u-u-u-es....\\" you can really hear it on \\"Bleach\\"--here, its all but lost. Still, as they say in the video editing biz, \\"they won't miss what they never saw...\\" and it's still nice to have the song included.<br /><br />The video disc is a nice consolation prize for a somewhat flimsy booklet & lack of extras--although most of them are available elsewhere, there's a great bonus in the form of a 1979 lip-synch appearance on \\"Top of the Pops\\" where the band performs \\"Sunday Girl\\", Debs in her black and white striped sailor dress, oversized sunglasses and red tights, Clem's drumset out front, the boys mugging playfully (Chris Stein was actually a handsome devil at the time!) I've seen this clip on bootleg TV compilations and it's always been one of my favorites. Top of the Pops was an excellently filmed show and I wouldn't mind having all of Blondie's appearances on it. (There's a particularly good live version of \\"Denis\\" with Debbie in red shirt and thigh boots that ranks as one of the bands best live TV appearances ever). Are you listening, BBC?<br /><br />All in all, the low price makes it worth picking up for the video alone. But when is someone going to come up with a beautifully packaged,  comprehensive book or box set on Blondie?s in her black and white striped sailor dress, oversized sunglasses and red tights, Clem's drumset out front, the boys mugging playfully (Chris Stein was actually a handsome devil at the time!)

B001M5UDGS|5.0|So it's nothing short of a miracle that I ran into this webcast musical. I'd never dipped in the pond of Whedon's work and at the time I wasn't a fan of any of the actors, but boy did that change.    I first heard about Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog from a couple weekly podcasts that I listened to and everyone loved it, so I gave it a try. I came out of the experience singing the catchy songs for weeks, seeking out the actors' works, and wanting to be a bigger Whedon fan.    The acting is spectacular. Neil Patrick Harris is one of the best actors of his generation and he shows real and refined talent by both singing and acting as Dr. Horrible himself. It's a shame that Nathan Fillion, Captain Hammer, is not an exploding star. Felica Day, too, exhibits fine acting and singing skills and it's hard not to fall in love with her character, Penny.    The Whedon team (+ Mo) do an amazing job of weaving together fine acting, extremely catchy and well-written songs, and witty, yet thought-provoking dialogue in the tragicomedy that is Dr. Horrible's Sing Along Blog and I, for one, cannot wait for more.

6305428557|5.0|This film is too often dismissed as a light-hearted Hugh Grant comedy.  But it is so much more: inspirational, emotional, and uplifting.  Every scene of this film is a painting, with incredible direction, set design, costume design, cinematography, editing, writing, musical soundtrack, and acting.  While Grant is superb, the performances of Kenneth Griffith as Reverend Jones, Ian McNiece as George Garrad, and Ian Hart as Johnny Shellshocked are superb.  In an age of slick film making with gratuitous meaningless violence and sexual innuendo, shallow scripts and meaningless stories, this movie stands for what is best for this medium, and how a character film can stand head and shoulder above the vast majority of cinemagraphic efforts attempted.  If you like character studies and great writing, watch this film!
B0007MWZEK|2.0|After a few months of using the sweeper, it no longer works for more than 30 seconds because the battery no longer charges properly. I used this on mainly hardwood and on some rug. After a while it's very troublesome to clean because hair easily gets tangled in the vac which in turn breaks the vac down. It is also very flimsy and plastic and so if you push it hard it overturns and all that you vacuumed -dirt, crumbs, etc. flies out, and you're left with an even greater mess to clean up. Rip-off. Get a vac at much better deals on Amazon or at Target.
0141031484|5.0|I would suggest that this book is NOT for someone who has a clear view of where they are going in life, and how they will get there. For in both the large and small events in life, there are unpredictable events. Nassim Taleb talks about how we handle those events, and more importantly, how we can use them in our favour. If you are one I recommend not to start the book, the reading may change your outlook. Permanently.    Taleb is a market trader, with experience of having survived several severe financial storms - `difficult trading conditions'. The book is peopled with real and composite characters from his trading life. Most are no longer working in the market, a result of having `blown up'. The essence of the volume is in the title, describing situations where an apparent underlying order was merely randomness with a semblance of tidiness.    The book ties several seemingly disparate subjects together; market trading (a fairly risky activity in itself), science, history, and philosophy of science. Taleb makes no secret of his own fallibility, reckoning that each of us is regularly fooled into thinking that what are really random actions have a basis in `science'. His standpoint is that he knows he is often hoodwinked, whereas others are not in this knowledgeable position. Sometimes it is using inductive reasoning, with too little information, whereas on other occasions it is faulty reasoning, or the mis-use of probability.      The author frequently cites Karl Popper, and his (when introduced in the 1930's) novel ideas on falsification. Rather interestingly, he gives some instances where Popper (the man) did not live up to Popperian principles. We are all fooled by randomness, and the irrational ways we think. Taleb does not actually use the cliché that the only golden rule is that there is no golden rule, but the sentiments are there.     Examples are frequently tied into the currency or bond market place. Would your current strategy be completely shaken by a`black swan' event, something that has never been seen before? We all develop strategies in life, for small events as well as larger occurrences. In these, each needs to consider what would happen if something that has never been seen before happens.    This volume is highly recommended, as an anti-dote to same-old / same-old thinking. It may not give any answers, but may encourage you to find strategies for yourself. Perhaps you too will become someone who loses a little frequently, but occasionally wins in a spectacular fashion. Compare this to traders who have `blown up'.     Those that do well are those that learn from their mistakes, are fooled by randomness (and know it) and have no personal capital tied up with past decisions (so are not afraid of changing their minds).

B00104W8T6|5.0|I LOVE soundtracks, especially when they include the actual music from the movie. If you have read any of my other soundtrack reviews, you will notice that NOT MANY soundtracks include actual music from their respective movies.    Juno, however, DOES. Not only does the soundtrack include all of the music used, it includes it IN THE ORDER IT APPEARS IN THE MOVIE ... yay!    I considered buying the 2-disc special edition of this, but in the end I purchased this single-disc version. I am HAPPY with my choice.    The liner notes reveal interesting facts about the making of the movie and the selection of music to go into the movie.    Now this CD travels with me in my car at all times. 2-thumbs up ... wizard.
0452289963|5.0|Many years ago before Eckhart Tolle was on Oprah Winfrey, a friend of mine who is Buddhist, highly recommended, [[ASIN:1577314808 The Power of Now: A Guide to Spiritual Enlightenment]].  I respected his opinion so I went to my local bookstore and flipped through a copy.  It looked verbose and boring.  I didn't buy it.    I don't even remember the circumstances, but in 2005, I saw \\"A New Earth\\" in the bookstore and felt drawn to pick it up.  I was floored by the teachings.  It made so much sense and had immediate applications in the moment.  In that moment, I chose to buy the book because it was the right book at that right moment for me.      I agree that Eckhart Tolle is not presenting anything new, but it's not the message, it's the medium that is important.  How many times have we heard things like \\"exercise and eat right\\", yet we don't act?  Sometimes, you just need to see the message presented in a different way and be in the right place in your life to receive it.      I heard a great saying the other day that completely shook the foundation  of smugness that my ego holds.  Here it is:  You don't know something unless you're living it.  So, unless you are truly living in the moment, regardless of what you've read or studied before, you DON'T KNOW what Eckhart Tolle is talking about.    I had the pleasure of seeing him speak live and he was incredibly powerful, yet extremely humble.  I also watched his video appearance on Oprah and from that, I learned what meditation truly is.  I understood what it meant to empty the mind and just be.  I realized meditation is not hard at all, it's insanely simple.      If this is your now, then this is your book.

0895260131|5.0|This is perhaps the most concise and pithy introduction to Islam for Americans. I have only found one error. The author stated that Christianity was not spread by the sword when he ought to have said that it was not intended by its founder to be spread that way, unlike Islam.     This book presents an accurate picture of the basic beliefs and foundations of Islam, though there are many, many different sects with different interpretations of their own. I am acquainted with at least on which does not believe in forcing this religion upon others and seems very spiritually advanced. Never the less, the basics presented in this book are crucial for an accurate and useful understanding of the mindset and cultural differences faced by anyone who wants to understand how we can relate to the Islamic world and protect ourselves from those who desire world domination and use Islam to recruit cannon fodder.

Some of the Special Features on the HD DVD are pretty interesting, including features on the car chase in Moscow and the explosion at the house in Berlin.  On the other hand, the director's commentary is absolutely awful.  He does nothing but tell you what's going on in the movie and what he believes are the characters' motivations.  He says virtually nothing about the actual making of the movie.  I was extremely disappointed.  Definitely not a model for other filmmakers.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I got this game last year after being introduced to it by a friend while going to university. I brought it over the following Thanksgiving to play with the family (2 sibilings in their late twenties and my parents in their 50's) and it ended up being the highlight of the holiday. We bought the seafaring expansion pack and we were all hopelessly addicted. Now my parents are calling me up all the time asking me to come visit them so they can get the 3-person needed to play! I am happy to oblige.    The game can take a little while to set up if you are still familiarizing yourself with the game. A game usually last about two hours as we do a lot of laughing and carrying-on with ridiculous, corny Settler in-jokes we've come up with, but it seems to go by pretty fast and we are usually ready to play another game or two. The randomness of the board layout and their being multiple ways to win has kept the game interesting. The introduction of the seafaring expansion as also been a great addition to the game. We are all eager to try other expansions.    I was a bit disappointed in the durability of the resource cards. Resource cards are constantly going from the bank to your hands and back to the bank. They started to show quite a bit of wear after about four months of playing. We ended up just lamenating them instead of having to buy new ones. The rest of the game pieces are durable and I don't expect to ever need to replace them. Makes sure you keep track of all those small wooden city and road pieces! They are small and could easily be lost.    Also, the cost of the game is a bit high. If you find that you really enjoy Settlers, you're probably going to want to buy some of the expansions, which are all priced just as high as the game itself. Although the Seafaring expansion has been great fun, it only came with the various colored ship pieces, some more water and land hexes and the manual which had some senarios and outlined a few new game mechanics. It didn't certainlydidn't seem like enough to me, but the game has become even more fun with the new game mechanics. If you want to play with a fifth or sixth person, you have to buy another expansion set for the core game as well more for any expansions you have. It's a fairly pricey game if you want to get some of the expansions, but I think it is totally worth it if you do find it addictive and fun.

0670019933|5.0|The year 2007 marked the 50th anniversary of the publication of Jack Kerouac's most famous novel, \\"On the Road.\\"  The event received a great deal of attention with the publication of the original scroll edition of the text, a 50th anniversary commemorative edition, a compilation of five \\"Road Novels\\" by the prestigious Library of America, and several excellent books and articles about Kerouac.<br /><br />The interest in Kerouac (1922-- 1969) continues.This year, 2008, has seen the publication of Kerouac's highly personal tribute to the Buddha written in 1955, \\"Wake up! A Life of the Buddha\\" together with an early novel,\\"The Hippos were boiled in their Tanks\\", written with William Burroughs. With the 50th anniversary of \\"The Dharma Bums\\" Kerouac's most popular novel after \\"On the Road\\", this new commemorative hardback edition of the text has been issued with a short letter written in 1958 by novelist Henry Miller to the publisher in praise of Kerouac's book and a previously published essay introducing the novel by Ann Douglas. The book is attractive and, here on Amazon, reasonably priced. Many paperback editions of this work are available and the Library of America's collection, which includes \\"The Dharma Bums\\" may by the best choice of all. Nevertheless, this volume is a good choice for those readers who love this book or for the lover of Kerouac on your holiday list.  The remainder of this review consists of my review on Amazon, with modifications, of an earlier edition of \\"The Dharma Bums\\".<br /><br />Following the success of \\"On the Road\\", Kerouac's publishers initially rejected his manuscripts such as \\"The Subterraneans\\" and \\"Tristessa.\\" But his publisher asked him to write an accessible, popular novel continuing with the themes of \\"On the Road.\\" Kerouac responded with \\"The Dharma Bums\\" which was published late in 1958. \\"The Dharma Bums\\" is more conventionally written that most of Kerouac's other books, with short, generally clear sentences and a story line that is optimistic on the whole. With the exception of \\"On the Road\\", \\"The Dharma Bums\\" remains Kerouac's most widely read work. I had the opportunity to reread \\"The Dharma Bums\\" and came away from the book deeply moved.<br /><br />As are all of Kerouac's novels, \\"The Dharma Bums\\" is autobiographical. It is based upon Kerouac's life between 1956--1957 -- before \\"On the Road\\" appeared and made Kerouac famous. The book focuses upon the relationship between Kerouac, who in the book is called Ray Smith and his friend, the poet Gary Snyder, called Japhy Ryder, ten years Kerouac's junior. Kerouac died in 1969, while Snyder is still alive and a highly regarded poet. Allen Ginsberg (Alvah Goldbrook) and Neal Cassady (Cody Pomeray), among others, also are characters in the book. Most of the book is set in San Francisco and its environs, but there are scenes of Kerouac's restless and extensive travelling by hitchiking, walking, jumping freight trains, and taking buses, as he visits Mexico, and his mother's home in Rocky Mount, North Carolina during the course of the book.<br /><br />The strength of \\"The Dharma Bums\\" lies in its scenes of spiritual seriousness and meditation. During the period described in the book, Kerouac had become greatly interested in Buddhism. He describes himself as a \\"bhikku\\" -- a Buddhist monk -- and had been celibate for a year when the book begins. It is easy to underestimate Kerouac's understanding of Buddhism. As with many authors, he was wiser in his writing that he was in his life. There is a sense of the sadness and changeable character of existence and of the value of compassion for all beings that comes through eloquently in \\"The Dharma Bums.\\" Smith and Ryder have many discussions about Buddhism -- at various levels of seriousness -- during the course of the novel. Ryder tends to use Buddhism to be critical of and alienated from American society and its excessive materialism and devotion to frivolity such as television. Smith has the broader vision and sees compassion and understanding as a necessary part of the lives of everyone. Smith tends to be more meditative and quiet in his Buddhist practice -- he spends a great deal of time in the book sitting and \\"doing nothing\\" while Ryder is generally active and on the go, hiking, chopping wood, studying, or womanizing. At the end of the book, he leaves for an extended trip to Japan. (He and Kerouac would never see each other again.)<br /><br />\\"The Dharma Bums\\" offers a picture of a portion of American Buddhism during the 1950s. It also offers a portrayal of what has been called the \\"rucksack revolution\\" as Smith and Ryder take to the outdoors.  in In a lengthy and famous section of the book, they climb the \\"Matterhorn\\" in California's Sierra Mountains. In the final chapters of the book, Kerouac spends eight isolated weeks on Desolation Peak in the Cascades as a fire watchman. In an ending reminiscent of the ending of \\"On the Road\\", Kerouac writes:<br /><br />\\"Now comes the sadness of coming back to cities and I'e grown two months older and there's all that humanity of bars and burlesque shows and gritty love, all upsidedown in the void, God bless them, but Japhy you and me forever we know, 'O ever youthful, O ever weeping'. Down on the lake rosy reflection of celestial vapor appeared, and I said 'God, I love you\\" and looked up to the sky and really meant it. 'I have fallen in love with you God. Take care of us all, one way or the other.\\"<br /><br />For all his love of Buddhism, Kerouac remained a theist. He came back from his experience on Desolation Peak, he tells the reader, yearning for human company.<br /><br />Sexuality plays an important role in \\"The Dharma Bums\\", against the backdrop of what is described as the repressed 1950's, as young girls are drawn to Ryder and he willingly shares them with an initially reluctant Smith. The book includes scenes of wild parties tinged, for Smith, with sadness, in which people of both sexes dance naked, get physically involved, and drink heavily. Near the end of the book, Ryder offers Smith a prophetic warning the alcoholism which would shortly thereafter ruin Kerouac's life.<br /><br />\\"The Dharma Bums\\" is a fundamentally American book and it is full of love for the places of America, for the opportunity it offers for spiritual exploration, and for its people. Kerouac's compassion was hard earned. In his introduction to a later book, \\"The Lonesome Traveller\\" he aptly described his books as involving the \\"preachment of universal kindness, which hysterial critics have failed to notice beneath frenetic activity of my true-story novels about the 'beat' generation. -- Am actually not 'beat' but strange solitary crazy Catholic mystic.\\" I found a feeling of spirituality, of love of life in the face of vicissitudes, and of America in \\"The Dharma Bums.\\" The work was indeed a popularization.

B000BBOUD6|4.0|Usually, watching a film adaptation of a book or story is a letdown. But in the case of Legends Of The Fall I'd have to say it is advisable to read the story before watching the film as it is helpful in understanding the motivations of the characters, even though the film differs greatly from the novella.     The film didn't--couldn't--portray character motivation as the story by Jim Harrison does. Watching the film without the background of the novella will have you wondering why the hell Suzanne and Tristan react like they do. It's difficult to catch the guilt of Tristan who fails to \\"take care of Samuel\\" and the manic depression suffered by Suzanne. The film, on it's own, cannot convey the clash of tradition against the new of the industrial revolution and a changing West.     Read the wonderful novella by Jim Harrison, then watch the film.    As an aside, a couple of years ago I went to a book signing of Jim Harrison's and someone asked him about his impressions of the film Legends Of The Fall. His reply was that, apparently, there must have been a lot of nearby laundry facilities in turn of the century Montana; everyone had such clean clothes in the film.

B0016Q2D5M|2.0|this movie has just come out new version of old movie the 3D is ok not really as good as some of my other older movies made in the late 50s  this movie is also out in blue ray 3D i have it and it is fantastic  best 3D movie i have in my collection sharp as a tack and things just pop out of the screen at you right in front of your face. if can get this movie in blue ray 3D it is amazing..............
B00127RAJY|5.0|i like Jillian from the Biggest Loser show and having this DVD is like having her right there in your room. she starts with a warm up then does cardio, weights and abs. she shows you ways to not do it, and ways that are for beginners or for advanced. i've only done this a couple times but i love it! it really get me sweating and out of breath so i know im losing weight. i recommend it!
B000000Y87|5.0|I , like many others, stumbled upon this album several years ago knot knowing what to expect.  I was blown away at the near-telepathic interplay and virtuostic playing all around.  I wanted to throw in my two cents here, having read that Paul Motain is kind of \\"in the background\\" for this album.  I have to disagree.  He uses only brushes the whole set, but he never misses a beat.  Just listen to Alice in wonderland when he follows bill's improvised lines PERFECTLY and kicks back in to the 3/4 feel with ease.  Glorias Step also has great examples of the interplay in the rhythm section.  Also, I think that he didn't really \\"play out\\" because Scott was playing the role of rhythm and lead (somewhat), so steady hands on the traps were needed.      Anywhoo, if you are a Bill Evans fan, a rhythm junkie, a bassist, or just a casual listener looking to expand your library, this is a GREAT choice!
B0010V4TZU|5.0|I/m not going to say I loved this band and grew out of it.  I/m not going to say I/m embarassed about liking them.  That/s because what it is, isn/t that this is a bad band,  or a bad album, or they don/t lack talent, it/s just that  you won/t listen to them after a while.  Just like people get sick of most things after a while.  Except, you/ll get sick of them a lot sooner.  Of course, if you haven/t heard this album,  please listen to it. It/s great.  The songs are catchy, and they/ll be all you/ll listen to for awhile.  I liked every song on this album, especially \\"M79\\".  That/s why I/m giving it five stars.  The other songs were all fine. I had them stuck in my head for a long time,  but now after all that, I don/t really want to hear them anymore.  Their songs were too good, too catchy.  I remembered every part of the songs.  Now they just don/t interest me anymore.  So:  Get the album  Listen   Enjoy  Enjoy   Enjoy  .  .  .  Forget about them.  For instance, they/re on my iPod that has limited space, space that could be used for something else. I won/t take them off because I know I like all the songs, but I won/t listen to them often either.  Dig?
B00005JLEU|5.0|This movie totally blew me away and opened up my eyes to this director. It will change your mind about JapAnimation.
B000002LR3|5.0|With every listen, I feel like there/s some slice of a song I hadn/t heard before. That/s the way great albums go. This album is not like any other I/ve ever heard. It/s a very spiritual experience. This album has me screaming after listening sometimes. I couldn/t believe it. I wanted to tell everybody about it, but I knew they couldn/t hear about it from me. This couldn/t be one of those albums you just hear about from somebody and give it a listen, you have to discover it. I/ve heard it a few times before now and never really got it like I do now. Of course, it always had me groovin before, but now it/s like the whole thing makes sense. It really is a great album. I first heard Primal Scream on the \\"Trainspotting\\" soundtrack, digged it and gave this a listen. I love it. Highly recommended. Of course, don/t listen to it if you/re anxiously awaiting to hear this pleasure, just let it ease on over you.
B001E7OO2I|5.0|This is more of the same from John Legend, which is not a bad thing!  More mellow and harmony with a great flow to the songs.  Really his best effort to date!!
B000001E18|4.0|With \\"Achtung,\\" old school fans thought they got the joke - then U2 embodied its intent to finally smash the mold into irreparable pieces. Broadcast here in blaring quasi-techno Zoosound is an unprecedented message for U2: artifice really is chic.  It was clear that U2 was trying to get away - but were they also trying to get one over?  I mean, it says techno, but finishes like soul.  Bono's falsetto seems to suck you into the truly false on \\"Lemon.\\"  But when the boys break it down (and out) the tune hits like blue-eyed Otis.  They sneak in a brighter, larger message about weathering sardonic imagery and broken hearts, and arriving the better for it on the other side.  No, musically it's not the band's strongest effort, but it takes songs of the personal to a whole other level.  \\"Zooropa\\" shows to still be core U2 - not at their most shallow, but merely their most ironic.
0307455874|4.0|I had a love/hate relationship with Obama!  Years ago before I even heard of him I wanted Hillary Clinton to run for president.  But then Obama won and I ended up agreeing with him just as much as I did for Clinton.  In the Pennsylvania primary I had a tough choice on who to vote for.  I respected both candidates mutually.  I ended up voting for Clinton not because she wasn't black, but because I have been a supporter of hers for years.  Anyhow this book is great for both Democrats and Republicans.  Even Republicans are realizing that we need some change in this country from the current direction of the Bush-controlled white house.  Even McCain tried to distance himself from Bush and coencidentally Bush didn't appear at the Republican National Convention.  This book is a great story of Obama's idea for America.  He showed that his view were popular with Americans struggling to get by and other Americans feeling sympathy for those who were struggling.  Now that Obama is elected we can definately see where he is going with his policy choices.  I was more than thrilled that he considered Hillary Clinton for the Secretary of State position!  I hope with an Obama and Clinton in the white house we can take back our country and start a new direction welcomed by both parties.  Whether you're Democrat or Republican you'll enjoy Obama's book \\"The Audacity of Hope.\\"  Highly reccomended.
B000W74EQC|5.0|This Harry Potter movie is excellent.  Actually, it was better than I expected.      Yes, the movie has cut many, many, small things from the book.  But, this is inevitable.  If everything from the book went into the movie, you would have a five or six hour movie.      I recommend this movie.
B00074DXJE|3.0|We heard about this movie and ordered it to watch on Halloween. Our plans was to pop some popcorn and watch Saw. Forget about eating while watching this show. If you like bloody shows with body parts cut off you will love this movie. Myself I don't care for it.
B000W746GK|5.0|This movie is excellent.      There is so much material in the book that folks should not be suprised that the movie does not have everything in it.  I was happy that so much managed to get in to this movie.  However, in cutting much out, sometimes you must add a smaller, shorter, piece of business to cushion the change.      I am happy to see as good a movie as this is.
B000V86OKG|5.0|With the way the debut season ended, you might think that they people in charge couldn't come up with anything to top that.  But they do and in spades too whether it's Dexter's \\"alleged drug addiction\\", the sponsor that is supposed to be helping him said addiction.  But she really has MANY issues going on with her which will made clear through the season.  I will just say the woman gives Glenn Close (Fatal Attraction) a good name.  Also Dexter is having issues with his girlfriend and a prolonged stay by her mother (JoBeth Williams) only conpounds the problems between them.<br /><br />Also one of his coworkers is on to him and late night murderous dealings and basically lets him know it every occasion whether by stalking him or just being the all around jerk that Doakes is throughout the show.  Along Lt. LaGuerta who's lost her job and is undercover (literally) trying to get it back by any means necessary.  Dex's sister Deb is having her own issues still reeling from her having the Ice Truck Killer as her steady boyfriend.  She finally finds someone and starts second guessing things and all that.  Another player comes in as well from the FBI, Agent Lundy who's task is to be bring in the new serial killer that no one knows is right under their noses.<br /><br />There are so many things going on in this season that its hard to believe that everything will get resolved but just look out for the last 2 or 3 episodes of this season to see how it does just that.  I won't say anymore other than, if your thinking about getting into the show start off at Season 1 and believe me.  By the time you get the second season of this show.  You will know others already know about Dexter.  It's a well done show, with an excellent cast and storylines as well.<br /><br />I can't wait until season 3 rolls around on dvd.
B00192KCQ0|3.0|Metallica shows a good amount of progress toward getting back to their roots in this album with good rhythms and decent build ups to the energy they offer but this is still a long way from the true heart of Metallica which exists in the first three albums: Kill `em All, Ride The Lightning and Master of Puppets; all thrash classics.    The first song, \\"That Was Just Your Life\\", is the closest this album comes to the original \\"real\\" Metallica. The rest of the songs are all just ok. I offer that with some reservation as I do like most of the rhythms but the biggest problem I had with this album is that Kirk is so disconnected from the songs in every lead. Most leads could be recreated by taping a few picks to a mini fan, throwing your fingers across the board in the blues scale and goin' crazy on the wah pedal. I haven't been much of a fan of Kirk's work since he started his constant overuse of the wah and the leads have gotten progressively worse over time. The wah can be a good effect if used in moderation but when overused it's a cover up for a poor connection to the song your creating the lead for. There were probably about 30-45 seconds total between all the songs where there seemed to be a connection between the rhythm and the lead.    I would definitely agree with another reviewer that of all the Metallica albums, \\"St. Anger\\" is a definite \\"no buy\\", hands-down worst album ever. Metallica has done a lot to sell themselves over the years and they've lost the true thrash band that once was through the process. I keep hoping to find the album that will be the return of that band but I don't see it happening.     Another sore point was the lyrics; less entertaining and more dark than in the past. The rhythms showed a good amount of energy but if the lyrics bring you down, the song loses some of that energy.    My message to Metallica: return to more energetic and/or entertaining lyrics and Kirk needs to take a moment to connect with each song he puts a lead into. Therhythms are ok but a little more energy could be worked into them as well. I'm almost certain none of the newer fans would agree with it but this message comes from someone who grew up with Metallica.    The true die hard Metallica fans will appreciate this album to some extent. The newer fans will appreciate it more so with songs more related to the Black album with Load and Reload being stepping stones.  In comparison, this one has less energy than those three but still a strong album.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Brutal, beautiful, relentless...there's cliches, and then there's archtypes...Jimi Hendrix; Pink Floyd; Black Flag; Chemical Brothers; METALLICA!  Please forget the whole download massacre- if you can't feel this, then you can dine on poop! Coming from an old fart who's been around the block too many times- if you think there might be something to the metal mania- check it out.  These guys are masters- think Hendrix, Floyd, the Flag, the Chem Bros.- metal is massive, and all those drug addicts/alcoholics can't be 100% wrong!  At the age of 58, I have to say, these monsters rocked my world! Please, God; MORE, MORE, MORE!       I liked it a lot.
0385340990|3.0|The story is set in the mid-1940's as the UK recovers from WWII.  Juliet Ashton is the central character - she is in her 30's - - lives in London - - and is a successful newspaper columnist who is looking for her next story idea.  By chance, she receives a letter from a resident on Guernsey in the Channel Islands who pulls her into a series of letter exchanges between other residents of Guernsey.  She finds herself building close relationships with Guernsey residents and becomes immersed in the history of the Island and the residents during the Nazi occupation during WWII - including the evacuation of children to England -- the starvation of the residents and the Nazi slaves and the horrors of the concentration camps.  Juliet decides to make a trip to Guernsey to build the foundation for her story.<br /><br />My assessment of the novel:<br /><br />1) It is a quick read<br /><br />2) It is charming, clever, entertaining and enlightening story on a subject that can be best described as dark<br /><br />3) The central characters in the story are colorful - with a deep sense of right and wrong - describing acts of courage, fortitude, endurance and most of all - survival.<br /><br />4) This is a \\"feel good\\" book that is interspersed with horrific stories of the occupation and the evil of the Nazi regime<br /><br />5) The authors have an effective visual writing style - you'll want to visit Guernsey to see the cliffs, the ocean, the gardens, the landscape - and meet the residents of the community.
1400082773|5.0|During the 2004 Democratic Convention Barack Obama burst onto the US national political scene with a speech that included this line: \\"I stand here knowing that my story is part of the larger American story, that I owe a debt to all of those who came before me, and that in no other country on Earth is my story even possible.\\"  Reading \\"Dreams from My Father\\" gives readers an important glimpse of part of that story.<br /><br />This autobiography was originally published in 1995, shortly after Obama became the first black editor of the prestigious Harvard Law Review. Because it was written before he entered politics, we are given an unusually candid account of his youth and young manhood, which included drugs, personal doubts, and a search for his identity as a black man in America. It is the unusual candor of his writing that leads me to recommend it \\"Dreams From My Father\\" to readers of all colors and political persuasions.<br /><br />In \\"The Audacity of Hope,\\" which was published to support Obama's run for President, one gains an appreciation for his unique blend of idealism and pragmatism, but \\"Dreams From My Father\\" provides a glimpse into how he became the man who defied the odds to become the first Black President of the United States.<br /><br />As a white American I gained a new appreciation of the inner struggles of Black Americans, but I also got the impression that because Obama was raised by his white mother and grandparents, he has the ability to see past issues of race. This ability is one that our nation sorely needs to move forward in tackling the problems that face people of all races and backgrounds..<br /><br />Watching the crowds on election night I was struck by the joy and hope I saw on the faces of young people, both black and white. I think this book is the sort of book one should share with young people because it speaks to the search for identity that drives many young people.  One does not get the sense one is reading the autobiography of a future president. Rather it could be any young man's story.<br /><br />What about those who voted for McCain and who are afraid that Obama is some sort of left-wing radical? Instead of listening to Rush Limbaugh (and others) I would encourage them to read Obama's words for themselves.<br /><br />Of course the story is incomplete since it was written while Obama was still at Harvard. We learn nothing of his career teaching constitutional law at the University of Chicago, not to mention his subsequent political career. No doubt that story will be written, but it will be difficult to re-capture the spirit of openness that makes this book a one of a kind.ld be any young man's story.

B0013FSL3E|1.0|I never ceased to be amazed at the greed of the movie studios. \\"Wall-e\\" is a home-run for Disney and they rush out defective DVDs packaged in cheap cardboard. Should you be lucky and receive a disc in perfect condition, it won't take long for serious scratches to accumulate. Its obvious that Disney executives don't give a damn regarding customer satisfaction.<br /><br />After having received and returned two defective discs in succession, Amazon will not ship me a third. I get a refund but not a replacement. So, I'll wait a few months for reports stating that the defective disc problem has been resolved and then purchase another copy of \\"Wall-e\\". I'll also purchase an empty jewel case to replace the cheap cardboard package. Nice.<br /><br />Regarding the people who will mark my product review down simply because they feel that a review should be limited to a pure evaluation of the movie - I say too bad. Although I love this movie, I hate the way Disney has cranked out so many bad discs with read errors. I also don't buy into Disney distributing the product in a cheap package under the banner of \\"going green.\\"  If you were fortunate enough to receive a perfect copy of Wall-e, then how nice for you. My review does not disrespect this excellent movie - it only gives an honest evaluation of a poor manufacturing and packaging process. Their quality control is sorely lacking. Consumers should be aware of this problem. Too many people have purchased this defective product. We paid our money - we only wanted to enjoy this fine movie. Peace.
B00005JMAH|4.0|The movie, \\"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\\", was a very good movie and I did enjoy it.  Soon after the beginning, there is an odd bus ride that I did not enjoy as much as I did in reading about it in the book.  Also, the movie overdoes the warnings of potential dangers from Sirius Black.  Finally, there are some serious changes from the book that appear in the movie.  And, there is a bunch of things in the book that do not make it to the movie.    However, once we are past the first quarter of the movie, it really got much better in my estimation.  The movie is less confusing than is the book for the last three quarters of the story.  There is a serious exception.  We get to the Shreeking Shack and, just when we need clarity, the movie is confusing.  Nevertheless, at the end, I appreciated the story that J. K. Rowling had created more than I had at the end of the book.  On the other hand, I think I would have been totally lost if I had not read the book first.    I recommend this movie but read the book before going.
1594489505|5.0|This is a great story and I highly recommend it to anyone!  It is very emotional and will have you flipping from page to page as quickly as you can just to see what's next!!!  Almost impossible to put down!  This will shed a lot of light on the aspect of women and religious fundamentalism!!!
0307387178|1.0|I feel the same as one of the other reviewers; why summarize the story on the cover and tell me what happens?    I couldn't get to the end of this book, to be honest, I couldn't even read past page 55ish.  I tried, I kept reading as much as I could and as far as I could, but this book isn't worth my time.      I will not finish the book regardless of how strongly I feel about finishing everything I start.  And, I would never recommend this book to anyone.
B001F12J3Y|4.0|A quick review don't get this for the 3D. After about 5 minutes I had to turn it off it was giving me a headache. This is the cheap red and blue glasses. I have a high end home theater with a 73 inch 1080p TV and it doesnt make it any better. Journey to the Center of the Earth has a purple and green lens and it is very good but this 3d is a waste of time, dont know why Warner even tried, they should be ashamed of themselves.    Soundwise in TrueHD this is why you get this. Crank it up it is so clear and quiet yet when the train takes off it rattles your seat but in a way that is loud but so clean. 2D looks great on bluray just dont get this for 3d you will be disapointed.
B00005JLEU|5.0|Simply put, this movie is gorgeous. The story of top notch and full of surprises.
B000001FOL|4.0|but after all these years  why no remastering ? this comes from tapes made in 1990-18 years old at least-and thats assuming they didnt use the LP master-from 1967
B000BTGY1O|5.0|Forget about Capote's cynical novella and enjoy what a couple of master Hollywood craftsmen (Edwards and Axelrod) spin from it. It is pure 24 k Romantic gold. There has never been a more perfect date movie.  Hepburn was never more radiantly beautiful than in 61. And Peppard is quite a piece of male eye candy. Together they are the perfect Upper East Side New York dysfunctional couple: Physical  perfection and infantile neurosis wrapped up in one  beautiful Tiffany Blue box of a movie.
1416594884|3.0|Well-written in most places, but...  The characters (especially the Americans) are cardboard cutouts, the plot plods along toward an all-too-predictable ending which you can see coming from miles away, and it has been done before - by le Carre himself in The Honourable Schoolboy.  Sad to see a master stylist in decline.
B001ECQ75A|5.0|I was absolutely thrilled with the product and the movie was so good and cute. I will order from them again for sure. The movie was in excellent shape and described just like they said.

0316067601|5.0|Never mind the title of my review. Just a little \\"dogging\\" from an old Marine grunt(1983-87). I found the book to be awesome and I usually only read non-fictions concerning the Marines in Vietnam. This book changed all of that . You can't put it down, once you've started.    At times, the author may seem to be a little overboard in his SEAL gung-ho's, but who am I to say that they don't brag a little too much. I was around a few Force Recon guys who never bragged, but I've never been around any SEAL (that I was aware of, that is...)      If the crowd that showed up at his parents home to support his family during his MIA status was as large as the author describes (which I did find to be a little hard to believe), then being a part of the SEAL brotherhood is something to be VERY proud of.      Once again, I found the book to be outstanding, and would recommend it to any veteran and non-veteran alike, no matter what branch of service.      Max Roark  Wpn's Co., 1/6   USMC 1983-87

B001GQ2TGA|3.0|usually I find enya's music to be complex, deep, and heartfelt.  I have almost every album so you could say I'm a fan.  However I really had to force myself to listen to the whole thing.  It's ok but that's it.  It's just ok.  I guess what I use to like was the layered complexity of her pieces, with this album she seems to be going for mainstream sound.  But all I heard was this monotone sound with a depressing overtone.  Maybe I should listen to Kenny-G.
B001DHXT20|5.0|AWESOME MOVIE. EDWARD NORTON AND LIV TYLER ARE SO GOOD PLAYING THEIR CHARACTERS AND THE MOVIE HAS ALOT OF ACTION AND A GOOD STORYLINE. i REALLY ENJOYED WATCHING IT.
B0018RWD1S|5.0|If she lives long enough and keeps developing her craft, Amy will rank among the great female vocalists of all time: Billie Holiday, Dinah Washington, Ella Fitzgerald, etc. On this album she manages to rise above some horrendous arrangements and tedious percussion (is it human or machine-made?) on \\"Round Midnight\\" and \\"Moody's Mood for Love\\" and others. Some of the newer material is outstanding and is brilliantly  executed: \\"I Heard Love Is Blind\\" and \\"F*** Me Pumps\\" come to mind. Curiously, the lengthy title song is my least favorite on the album, but I don't care: There are so many others to enjoy and savor. I wish she would take better care of herself. It is as if she is slowly committing suicide before our eyes...and no one seems able to stop her.
B001C08RHA|5.0|ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES OF THE YEAR. ROBERT DOWNEY JR IS AN AWESOME ACTOR AND THE ACTION IN THIS MOVIE IS INCREDIBLE ALONG WITH JEFF BRIDGES WHO DOES A SUPER JOB AS THE BAD GUY. GWYNETH PALTROW IS AWESOME TOO. I LOVE THIS MOVIE. WE WATCH IT ALL THE TIME.
