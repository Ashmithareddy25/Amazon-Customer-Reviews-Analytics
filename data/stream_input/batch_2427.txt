B00CH87HF4|2.0|I don't mind grinding levels to progress in a game, I'm old school like that, however this game seems to take it to another level. Making the levels so that you can be almost double the level of the mobs that you are fighting virtually impossible on the one hand and dangling (seemingly game-breakingly good items/weapons/power ups) real money costing solutions right in your face. I get that it's a high quality free game and they have to make a profit somehow, this game is just a lot more shameless and a lot more manipulative-seeming about it.<br />Had some fun, but can't recommend it to friends.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Best game ever. Just what I need to relax to and gives my mind something to do besides watching TV all the time.<br />Sincerely, Pam Leach
B005ILWOZA|5.0|James Morrison may share the same name as another legendary singer of decades past, but he stands in no one's shadow. No one could mistake James Morrison for any other artist, past or present. This young Brit put out an astonishingly good debut CD in 2007, followed that up with a solid sophmore effort in 2009 that delivered several memorable songs (and one instant classic that could make the dead dance: \\"Nothing Ever Hurt Like You\\") and in 2011 delivered this third CD, which demonstrates steady steps towards greatness. So many of us have been pushed to despair by music today- the endless deluge of mindless, formulaic, charts-driven crap. Morrison doesn't seem to be composing (yes, he writes all his own music) according to standard chart-success algorithms that seem to have enslaved most \\"performers\\" on the scene these days. As in the case of Adele, Morrison's music completely defies those compulsory formats imposed by radio stations and the charts today, and it soars to unheard-of heights precisely because of that defiance. And because of that voice, one that seems to reach down into your soul and pluck every string. Like Adele, his music influences as a kid came from what surrounded him. In this case, that being his parents' collection of soul, folk, blues and country. Morrison, like Adele, is an original, not some version of someone else. It's that eclectic mix of old school music from his childhood, channeled now through his own modern sensibilities, that makes his music so astonishingly distinctive and irresistible. And it's that old soul in him that speaks through lyrics of remarkable power and elegant simplicity that pull you even deeper into every song. Well, and then there's that voice. There are only a few people on the planet who get a gift that unique. So yeah, go ahead and try to pick a favorite song from \\"The Awakening.\\" Just one. Go ahead and try. I dare you.
B00821OX98|5.0|I am a fan of science fiction and especially alien encounters. This series fit the bill. Good special effects, but also character development and plot.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Its a nice simple book with the basics explained very clearly. Its all that matters really in the long term, to have your fundamentals clear. How to eat what to eat, how to balance meals proportions. Basic core exercises, other strengthening exercises and how to maximise gains. With no background in weight training this was a fresh start for me and extremely useful.<br />Great buy for the price and would recommend surely!. Also Mike will give you feedback personally on any questions or doubts you might have. Thats a big added bonus in my opinion.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Heard about the show from various people and finally watched it on Amazon. It's very addictive and I love it!

B007REV4YI|5.0|A fabulous movie.  Top 10 in the Bond series.  A distinctly British flavor/flavour to the film...not seen in many others!  Hip Hip Hooray for Bond, Sam Mendes, EON productions, Daniel Craig, Judy Dench, Javier Bardem, Ralph Fiennes, Naomie Harris, B&eacute;r&eacute;nice Marlohe, and .Albert Finney.
B00B0U2SEA|3.0|The blue ray disc was fine but the DVD was scratched, so I think the quality control department needs to do a better job.  I'm glad that I have a blue ray so that I don't need the DVD.  But it would have been nice to share the DVD with a friend.

B008AX1HD8|1.0|I have read all Jo Nesbo books and loved them they were exciting all except The Bat it was slow going and I can truly say there wasn't much about the book I liked
B00CDT41RY|3.0|Decent entertainment, and the acting was good. But this was entertainment Tarantino style, which is to say, historically inaccurate to say the least. The plot is formulaic, the dialogue a bit above average: only the acting makes this an above average movie. Well, that and the Tarantino style (somewhere between pulp fiction and comic book) which he does well. Worth watching once.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|i have heard so many good things about &#34;The Good Wife&#34; so i tried it out on Amazon.  What a great show!! So happy this is available to Prime subscribers for free.  I'm going to continue watching this show and definitely recommend it to anyone who is also a fan of shows like LA Law and Boston Legal.
B0002X314C|5.0|Once again, great album, great songwriting, great songs. John Legend resonates deep. This was bought as a gift for a guy and he loves it
B001O1O71C|5.0|My daughter recommend it.  I was a young person when the Nazis were doing their horrible acts.

B005LAIIHG|1.0|They must have made several copies of this DVD to sale because that is the only reason why it would not play in my DVD player. It does not play on regular DVD players. Trust me. I tried it on mine, my parents', and my grandfather's with no luck. It keeps saying bad disc. I could play it on the computer, tv/dvd combo and even my small radio/cd/tv/dvd portable boombox type, though. I returned it, and received a new one that did the same thing. I did not want to go through the hassle to return it, so I had to connect my boombox to my tv in lieu of my actual dvd player to get this to play on my tv. This is terrible. All my other dvds play even one that was new that I had not gotten around to opening.

You need to research the term `bliss point`.<br /><br />The guilt you have been feeling every time you eat something, every time you feed your kids junk food because you're just too tired and it's all they will eat ... it's all been carefully orchestrated by an elite few food, beverage and tobacco companies.  Then they've got the cheek to say that us as consumers need to eat less and more healthy when their products have been chemically engineered to make us completely addicted to them and completely incapable of stopping eating!  Plus bringing out fake healthy alternatives for us that merely drive up their sales. And then topping it all off with misleading and confusing labeling to pull the wool over your eyes about what you're eating.  It's nothing short of criminal.<br /><br />It makes me sick!

But staying in the middle of this perfect storm is nothing short of catastrophic for you and your family. The irony is, if you took the time to change to locally produced, organic, chemical free alternatives, you will have more energy you ever had before and thus more time on your hands.

0812993357|3.0|I've been a Vogue subscriber for 10 years now and I've been admiring Ms. Coddington's beautiful work long before most of the world first discovered Grace from \\"The September Issue\\". Of course \\"The September Issue\\" is a great peek into the workings of Vogue and what Grace does there. Because of her personality and likability, she was absolutely the star of the film. I was glad to see that Grace wrote a memoir because seeing her in \\"The September Issue\\" made me wish to know even more about the woman whose work I look forward to seeing each month in Vogue.<br /><br />However, I was a little disappointed with the result of the memoir. The way the book was written, never really drew me in. There was not much in it that made me want to sit down and read the book cover to cover. Because she seems to be such a private person, she doesn't really seem to let her guard down. There just seemed to be some disconnect, like she wasn't sure that she really wanted to be writing this or something.<br /><br />There were some interesting parts of the book that I enjoyed and I really enjoyed the little drawings that she included throughout the book. I enjoyed getting a peek into the fashion industry. But overall,I was just a little disappointed in the book.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|The book's format was not in the typical fashion. It was very refreshing. I couldn't put down the book. I would definitely recommend this book.

B0034DGPEU|5.0|I found this book hard to read because of the way African Americans were treated but the story is so well written and gives us a picture of what it was like to be a slave.  The story takes unexpected turns which makes for a very interesting read, I couldn't put it down.

0425263908|3.0|Okay here's the thing, both Fifty Shades and Bared to You are elementary novels. They're both an easy read but in my opinion, Fifty Shades flows SO much better while Bared to You is written more sloppy. Basically, Bared to You is like a copy of Fifty Shades. I've only read the first book of the Crossfire series, but so far there is unbelievable amount of similarities that I feel like Sylvia Day is trying too hard to be like E.L.  James (probably because of the insane success Fifty Shades had). Granted there are a few major differences in the main story line, all the similarities make it hard not to think she copied James in some ways. Bared to You is a lot more graphic which could also be the reason I like Fifty Shades more.<br /><br />Anyway, I wouldn't say that Bared to you is a bad book, but when you've read both, it's REALLY hard not to compare them.
B007QDNKQA|5.0|I would recommend the movie SHOOTER to other action movie fans!! Wahlberg is great in title role! The movie was packed full of intrigue and suspense.

B00AE5R2NO|4.0|Gup e is a hard to find and expensive Octonauts toy. Toy Crazes is a mail order company and got the toy from the UK. It shipped very quickly and got here (clear to the US West) within a couple of weeks, which isn't long considering the distance and shipping was free. The cost was a lot lower than what I've seen on Ebay. Using my visa rewards points helped lower the cost further. My son loves this toy and it's made well. The best part is that all the Octonauts toys can go into the tub.

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Before I read this book, I looked at several reviews for this book. I am so glad I decided to read this one despite the reviews. The first thing you must remember is this trilogy is not a love story. It was never meant to be one, never written as one, and was not turned into one. If you are looking for a love story I suggest a Nicholas Sparks book. This story is about War. Point blank.  This is the final chapter in the war. This  book shows us what happens towards the end of a war. People die,  for no reason other than its war, people lose their minds after being tortured,people shut down after experiencing war. An  this author has brought that reality to her characters, she shows how the war changes people an  how even when it's all done and over with for those who experienced it, it is never over in their minds.<br /><br />An amazing Story with a realistic ending for once.<br /><br />An
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|Watching this classical musical, I cannot help but be drawn to the message of redemption and hope throughout the film. The movie is excellent for the entire family and is filled with a positive redeeming message throughout. The struggle of redemption and hope speak to our daily lives. The character of Jean Valjean is filled with second chances and fresh opportunity. The musical creates an inspiration to  become greater then ourselves. When Valjean is caught with stolen silver from the abbey, the priest ultimately provides gives him a second chance. He forgives the theft and even gives Valjean the most valuable silver pieces. This redemption creates a domino effect in Valjean's life, from this act of kindness multiple acts are birthed. Even in the end when Valjean spares Javert the message is one of forgiveness and redemption. While Jevert cannot life with being saved, he nonetheless has been freed. Watching Les Mis forces me as an individual to think about my own life. Have I been in Jean Valjean's situation? When have I extended forgiveness to others or been there second chance? Overall, I highly recommend this film and hope it inspires you as it has hundreds of thousands already. The mistake would be to watch Les Mis and simply call it a good musical, the message behind the story should speak to our own lives as well.
B008M721MS|3.0|Dissapointed. I'd like to know why it is saying I have 20 free remaining video messages left? I thought Skype to Skype video messages were a;ways free?

B00B99KJR0|5.0|I tried this out and now I can't put it down. I play it on the kindle fire and haven't had any problems with it. Best of all it was free! I think it's better than Bejeweled and I really like Bejeweled. It puts you to work to get your pieces out of the puzzle. Plus it gives you a story behind each place which is good for kids that are practicing their reading skills. If they come out with another, I will gladly play it.
0345529057|5.0|This series has certainly been created with the idea that you would read all the books in order; however, each book seems to stand on its own and have its own tone. It is just really good.
B007VUA7VO|3.0|Hi well I think it's an ok app however I tend to believe that it's not really doing anything to help the battery life or the kindle it's just a reminder that your battery is getting low but again it too is taking away from your battery life so basically it either keep checking your battery yourself so you don't need a reminder
B0060MYM7O|5.0|For those of us who do not pay for HBO this is a must have. This series is a really great adaptation of the original book series. The acting in particular is just awesome.
B00821OX98|5.0|I don't know what it is about the show but I'm completely addicted to it now lol but that's one addiction I can deal with.
B00B2QA646|4.0|I read the book for the first time before watching this movie. I was wondering how in the world they were going to fit so much book into one film but I would say they did it very successfully. The whole &#34;as seen on stage&#34; point of view took a little getting used to but I liked it in the end.
1481278738|3.0|There was a lot of photo composition, and not enough how to use the camera, nor enough about why you would choose a particular frames per second and the resolution that goes with it. Still, it's a worthwhile book.
B005HED08I|4.0|Despite the pausings and escapings to the Amazon Prime main menu, this is a great remastering of classic Star Trek. I wish Amazon would fix the bugs that are making the video pause and return to the main screen. This is happening too often especially with movies even in dual band internet setting of 5G.

0393327345|4.0|In the book Fight Club the main characters are the Narrator and Tyler Durden. These two go through a lot of different situations together, and face a lot of different obstacles throughout the book. It's about the Narrators life and he explains how it is a meaningless cycle. Because of this he has insomnia and meets Tyler. Before he meets Tyler, he goes to a different support group for a different type of illness every day of the week. In his mind this helps him with his insomnia. When Tyler comes into the picture he stops going to the support groups and him and Tyler start fight club. The first rule of fight club is to not talk about fight club. Once fight club starts getting popular, Tyler starts something called Project Mayhem. Different people who join are given assignments to go out and cause mayhem. This book has some of the most powerful quotes you could read. Some of them are, \\"I don't want to die without any scars.\\" \\"This is your life, and its ending one moment at a time.' `The things you used to own, now they own you.\\" `The lower you fall, the higher you'll fly.' And last but not least, \\"I wanted to destroy everything beautiful I'd never have.\\" There are millions of quotes throughout that make you realized things or think in a different way and it makes it very interesting to read. Each chapter pulls you in more and more as they go along. It's impossible to get bored with this book, and anyone could relate to it in so many ways. The twists and turns taken in this book will keep you wanting more, and I recommend Fight Club to anybody who wants to sit down and read a book. Trust me, you can't go wrong with this one.
B004SRPXWQ|1.0|I got this app hoping that it would be a time killer but it is rely just a wast of time it would not repeat what I told it to so know all I can do is slap the cat
B00BB8RKH6|4.0|Denzel is the best airline pilot in the universe. He is also an alcoholic.  He crashes his airliner, even though he's schnockered, but his flying prowess saves nearly everyone aboard.  This is in the first 15 minutes.  The rest is<br />about him wrestling with the booze (and drugs).<br /><br />Worth seeing for the acting .. Denzel is great as always ... but you gotta check out John Goodman as Denzel's drug supplier! That's like no Goodman you've ever seen before ... a long way from Raising Arizona.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|Well if u haven't yet uploaded this app yet and you love animals, you're going to miss out.I would highly recommend getting the one that is not free which is the updated version. The free download takes a while to get to the game. I love it and so do my friends and family members who have been in the game on their IPad playing the game. Apparently, my mom makes me do unneeded chores like, clean out my wallet . -_-
B001HZK8FY|5.0|I bought this as a gift.My mother loved it and said it was the most thoughtful gift she has ever received.
B00594XOZU|5.0|This texting app is the best you can change your chat bubble color at least on I products. It's super fast at sending messages and is really good at geetting messages fast!
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|The Ultimate in fan appreciation is when a movie can successfully portray the actual and perceived worth of a character from the written word or a picture. MARVELS THE AVENGERS does this and more and does it for over 2 hours. Amazing.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Doent have all i want but it still has a lot of the videos i want i definently recommend it to anyone who likes music videos
B005WUHAX8|4.0|This case defanetly looks great and works just like it claims. only complaint is you get and echo on the other end of the line , but other than that great case.
B009IEXKXI|2.0|I found the narrative to be slow, plodding and somewhat juvenile in some cases. After a while I didn't much care whether the main character made it back to earth or not. I am a Sci-Fi fan but this one did not ever reach the &#34;I can't put this down&#34; moment.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|I am still reading this book and am enjoying the writing style and how the characters lives intersect during difficult times.  It is definitely a page turner, but I think it could be a bit shorter.  I am still reading this book and while I am sucked in, I could do without some of the details that make this book a bit drawn out.
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|I read the book a couple of years ago and wondered how the story could be adequately told in film.  I was impressed.  It stayed close to the book, the acting was excellent, and the special effects not too invasive.  Still leaves the viewer with the lady or the tiger issue at the end.<br />Judy
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love facebook, I really enjoy, and go on facebook everyday, I have found old friends on there thanks janet
B004QK5N5W|2.0|Looks like it, acts like it, but not genuine. Works sometimes, sometimes not. Ended up paying the $$$ for a real one from the local store.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is awesome because the updates are wonderful and the music sounds good. I like how you get rewarded for completing the daily challenge. Thank God for Subway Surfers!!!!!
B00CHILW64|5.0|great movie!  very scary and thoughtful. realistic, enjoyable entertains all the way<br /><br />&#34;impossible&#34;. that's the everyday in this Obama administration !!!!!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Love this book series so I love this book.  I have read it at least 4 times but still enjoy it.
B00BSBT8M6|5.0|followed the book pretty well -<br />I like how the ending was handled - it did not strip the value of the story. I kind of wish I'd have purchased it, instead of rented it. Awesome Effects.
B005460302|4.0|I Saw This Movie On Cable Way Back In '88 or '89, Can't Remember When Exactly...It Has The Funny Asian Guy From Sixteen Candles In It, Some Good Lookin' Strippers and Deedee Phiepper In It, I Bought It Mainly Because I Miss The 80s And Have A Nice Collection Of 80s Comedy/Dramas On DVD...Plan On Purchasing BETTER OFF DEAD On Blu-Ray Disc Next...
B001XV3LSS|4.0|This isn't the first time I've watched the movie, so I have to give it a good review.  It's nice to see so many famous actors and actresses in a movie when they were so young and already a household name.  I liked the concept of the story (no spoiler), and I think it makes the viewer consider the question about being alone or not in this universe (or on this world).
B007IK44CK|5.0|Say what you will about Tom's personal convictions and off-screen actions, his acting is pretty darn engaging in this action series.  I enjoyed it very much.
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|I enjoyed this movie more than I had expected.  Good watch, funny at times, and nice action scenes. Recommend it.
B001A4LYN2|4.0|In the end, the love of money over people leaves an old man wealthy and ALONE!<br />Hell, we all love money and power, but if all it brings is possessions and bitterness then somehow, you've missed the point!<br />This movie is a clearly written and filmed study of how to accomplish just that.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Great story and cast. Lots of blood so it is not for the squeamish. Vintage Tarantino. Instant classic right here.
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|A surefire way to smack self-pity in the face!<br />If you find yourself taking what little you have for granted, watch this painfully honest life story for an extreme wake up call.<br />&#34;I was sorry for myself bacause I had no shoes, until I saw the man who had no feet!&#34;
B00AHSMDQY|5.0|Some will say it is a bit too long but this is a great way to follow Dark Knight. Very good replay value, a must own title.
B00CDT41RY|4.0|A little retro with a lot of what you have'nt seen before! The &#34;Whippee&#34; becomes the &#34;Whipper&#34; and more. Boy oh boy, is there MORE! About midway through is five minutes of comic relief that will take the wind out of every Clan member's sails!
B00BSBT8M6|4.0|The movie felt a bit long, but the story developed well and the visuals were awesome. I could imagine how good watching This in an imax theater would be.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Love this show and can't wait to see the rest of it.....didn't watch it on TV but heard so many good reviews from friends and family that were keeping up with it.....I just had to see for myself.  Enjoying it so much.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I must say \\"WOW\\" this is super useful application to have on your tablet. It gives you full remote access to any windows based machines using RDP and run all the applications remotely. I attempted this Jump Desktop App on my Samsung Galaxy tab 2 running Jelly bean 4.1 and I am pleased to report that it works like a champ. The mouse pointer integration is super and works great. The rendering of screens works perfectly and you can even use full screen on your tablet and it makes it look like as if you are physically connected to the remote windows machine.<br /><br />The pinch zoom feature on remote desktop is nice to have makes it easy to read. I have tried various other remote desktop apps before and had partial success but this is a truly well designed thought after app and this is one of the very best. Download it today and you will find this app super useful to remotely control your Windows machines using RDP and VNC for Mac OS.<br /><br />Kudos to the developer for a super app - Full five stars from me.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|Very interesting. A real page turner. Definitely a great book for those looking for a real twist. Slow at first but worth the read.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Wanted a clock that I could use in the middle of the night without it shining in the darkness. I only wanted to see the time when I wanted not all the time. I also wanted to have my music to go to sleep by. Found it today. I hope it works as well as it looks and as well as the reviews.
1594484805|4.0|As a marketing person, this has helped me have more leverage with clients and it really explains how different type of jobs and heuristic or algorithmic matter to how one is motivated or not.
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark has written her usual mystery that keeps you hanging, can't put the book down.  You never know who the bad person is till the end, She brings so many people into the story and intertwines them.  I love her writing, wish she would do more than one per year.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Great American military story. It shows why America has the greatest fighting force in the world! Without these guys sacrifice, honor, courage, and strength the United States would not be able to carry out a lot of the mission we never hear about.
B00632HWOG|5.0|It has reduced junk emails when compared to my hotmail or google emails and I like the features in it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is incredibly awesome!!!!! You survive in a world where you need to collect the blocks needed to live. Even better, it UPDATES!!!! I think it's 0.6.1. right now, and I can't wait till the next one.
B00B1ME11U|5.0|From the opening song Earth Rocker, to The Wolfman KIndly Requests... this is vintage Clutch!!! Anyone who's a fan will understand, and for the rest, if you like hard driving rock with sludged up groove and surreal lyrics, buy it!!! Not sure? Buy it!!! You will not regret it.
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|One of my favorite movies. I love that it has a lot of the extra scenes.<br />Great, clean movie that makes you think about reality shows.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|I think it was good I just hope they make a 2nd one!:) so I mean another one please please!
B000SEIK2S|4.0|The concept of retiring to become a super-warrior is very compelling and author Scalzi is good at making it believable.  The fart jokes were a bit tiring in the beginning and mercifully didn't last long. At mid-stride into the book the situations were very engaging.  Towards the end of the book the situations became predictable and contrived, with a lets-get-this-book-finished feeling to the writing near the end.<br />I did enjoy the book and I'm glad I found it, but decided not to continue with the series because of the feeling the follow on books would be too predictable.
B000JIHP88|5.0|My daughter loved it as a mobile and now even better as a music box. She loved it so much she would wake up to turn on the sounds in the middle of the night! We have since taken it out of her crib and she happily listens to it while she falls asleep for naps and bedtime. I would definitely recommend it to anyone!
B00BESM14U|5.0|I read the book before I saw the movie, which I have learned isn't always the best thing to do because you may easily leave the movie disappointed and wishing they could have &#34;just added this one part&#34; of the book. Given time constraints and the cost of putting a movie together, I am still very pleased with how the book was represented in the movie. Sure, there were parts that I wished would have been in the movie, such as the more in depth situation with his sister and her boyfriend. But, given that they had to have a complete movie with no strings out there that haven't been addressed, I am glad I watched it.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|It has singing. Lots of singing. SO MUCH SINGING. LOTS AND LOTS OF GOOD SINGING. I had to write five more words.
B008NW67IQ|5.0|I really enjoy Mumford and Sons and this album is definitely a continuation of the same amazing sound they have. Well done and I can't wait to hear what they have for their third album.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Sub way sufers is nice to play because the diffent bords. Many people say it kid game its not  . I hate people hwo say that
B006LSZECO|4.0|The beginning was a little slow but once you are in it you can't put it down.  Lots of twists and turns
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|What a beautiful story full of sweetness,tenderness, love, sadness, forgiveness, acceptance....what a heart wrenching story.  It made me cry, it made me sad, it made me happy, it made me laugh.  I would definitely recommend this sweet story.
B00498YZH8|1.0|I live in Alaska....sometimes our internet is not so good....in 24 hours I never managed to watch more than 15 minutes of movie....kept stopping. Then my 24 hours was up and I never did get to watch it....
B0039HR5QS|5.0|For anyone who likes the recent barage of conspiracy theory movies - check this one out! Many of the scenario's and situations that this movie inferred over a quarter century ago have come to pass (and then some).
B001CBBGM2|4.0|I honestly stumbled on SG-A after being intrigued by Jason Momoa's performance in Game of Thrones & looking for other things he's been in. Had never seen and SG series despite being a fan of Star Trek and the new Battlestar Galactica. Quite enjoyed all 5 seasons of SG-A; good stories, intriguing characters, and any sci fi show that actually mentions Nikola Tesla is worth it's salt!
B00CDT41RY|1.0|This movie is so stupid. All it showed was every white guy was an ignorant race hating begot. I believe this and many other issues surrounding Hollywood and the media add to the division that keeps spewing out of Washington. I made it through about an hour and had my fill of this race crap run down my throat. Please, If you are reading this to determine if you want to watch this then heed my warning. This is nothing more than a B rated flick at best, (pour, pour acting), designed to stir hatred and descent amongst Americans that spent years working to get along. All Ive seen from this is White man is stupid and blacks are smart and tough. Please don't buy into this kind of cheap theater.<br />Besides, what they show is nothing like it trully was in those days.
B007RCJNDE|4.0|After 18 years it is finally over. Long awaited. I am probably biased, I feel this book deserves a reader who is fresh, unfortunately I am jaded by the saga of Robert Jordan. Too much filler in some books have made me lose my love of the series. Well recommended for new readers, an epic sweeping tale that will suck you in. Personally I would love Sanderson to rewrite some of the books to make them tighter and more focused. Sanderson wraps in up very well. No new plot lines, crisp delivery.<br />Defintely going to read his stuff now.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|After reading the reviews I purchased and have not regretted it. I wanted a more challenging game that involves skill and this is it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|if you like solitare its a good game  has mutilple ways to play just wish it was scored like they do in vagas
B00AFROVQC|2.0|This series is full of one dimensional characters and cliche story lines.  I don't get what others liked about this at all.  I liked the way the story started but it just fell flat after that.  I usually finish even bad series but stopped after book 2 with this one.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Good plot. Lots of twists and turns to keep you interested and make you want to see the next episode.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Of course I love dogs but this one really is special. His family is not bad either. A very enjoyable read.
160774273X|5.0|.........excellent book with the right twist for the home bread baker. Great recipes and some interesting facts make for a great cover to cover read!
B000UZNRS2|5.0|All the Oliver Stone books by Baldacci are fun to read, exciting, definitely hard to put down and well written.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|Exciting fantasy adventure.  Love the series.  Love all the books in the series.  Once you start reading you can't put it down.  Can't wait until the next book comes out!
B007PKSN6Q|4.0|It is a little different hearing the people from the movie singing instead of original artists, but still so much fun!
B001NLL93W|5.0|Exciting fantasy adventure.  Love the series.  Love all the books in the series.  Once you start reading you can't put it down.  Can't wait until the next book comes out!
B00881PTRC|4.0|I enjoy the animated characters play out their roles during the game. This is easily the best hangman game out there.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Really like the challenge of this game, play it about everyday..<br />Loads slow sometimes though....<br />Best part is trying to beat the best time and fewest amount of moves..
B0046B1KHG|5.0|I love this movie.  I watched it on Netflix and when I saw it here, I knew I had to own it.  A really cute and different plot, being from the &#34;villian's&#34; perspective.  Great animation, great actors, great plot.  I'm not sure about really young children seeing it.  Not because there is anything bad, that I can remember, in it but it is perhaps a bit advanced for small children.  Also, for my tastes, it would be a bit dark for me to show to my 3 year old nephew.  But I love it.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|great show, great streaming. very easy to connect and its avalable in HD. i've seen all seasons this way .
B0060CV31C|5.0|I adore this movie.  It's hilarious.  Some of the dialogue is priceless and extremely quotable.  I have seen this movie at least a dozen times and was so excited to finally own it.  It's different.  The characters are very lovable.  All around a great family film.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love being able to find whatever I need just by googling.  Whoever came up with this concept is a pure genius!  Once you google, you are hooked.
1451627297|5.0|This is Stephen King through and through.  I couldn't figure out where this book was going or how it was going to get there.  That is good writing in my opinion.  I highly recommend it.
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|The importance of real relationships, the influence of media and \\"reality\\" shows, and man's search for what is real and true--think Plato's Cave Allegory!
B002VPE1AW|5.0|Exciting, whimsical, great visuals and special effects. A little bit of everything, adventure, romance, action, good guys vs bad guys, imaginative feel good movie.
B00CDSVZHY|5.0|Actually, awesome!!! A great soundtrack to go with the movie as well. Whitty and tons of action never a dull moment!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|This is the second time I have read this book.  I liked it much more this time.  Love the characters.  Facts are so acurate about Versailles.  Toured there after reading the book the first time and knew what the tour guide was going to say ahead of time.  Have read all books in the series and am waiting anxiously for the next one.
B008AYA7WE|5.0|never bored. always entertaining. worth my time and energy after a hard days work. you wont be disappointed. get it
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|I enjoyed the first game. So far this is just as much fun. Looking forward to seeing what the new characters can do.
0810996596|5.0|Kirk is a passionate collector of all things classic horror.  Though I'm not as big into horror themed toys as he is, there is much here to drool over, and the book's design is really creative.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is cool and really fun and the graffics are awesome I just wanted to say thank you for the game oh! And I'm liken timely
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was s very quick read. I enjoyed every minute of this book. This is the first book I have read that was written by Mira Lyn Kelly. I can't wait to read more of her stories.
0439023513|3.0|The Districts are at war with the Capitol, and they want Katniss to be their representative--but, still suffering fallout from the Hunger Games, she refuses to be a passive and compliant figurehead. For better or worse, this series has been fun--it's violent and confrontational, but the reading audience joins the Capitol in appreciating the thrill of the Games. Mockingjay is the least reiterative and grimmest book of the series; it's still full of action, but the Games format and mediatized aspects disintegrate in the face of revolution and what remains is the battle between Katniss's devastated mental state and the realities of war. It's a bold end to the series--bold precisely because it avoids a cinematic victory, instead offering something less consumable and more personal--but it feels a little out of place, and nothing about it is fun. Collins remains a subpar writer who can't meet the emotional challenge she's set for herself, largely because Katniss's narrative is choppy and voiceless. But while Mockingjay didn't capture me, I admire the decision not to take the easy path. In its way, this is a fitting end. I've had numerous issues with this series, but I'm glad I gave it a go and despite my many caveats I continue to recommend it.
0061743526|4.0|The book cover was just a little rough but other than that I'm looking forward to reading the book for the first time. Seen the movie several times. Thank you Amazon.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|If you enjoy the &#34;un-explainable&#34; events and Sci-fy, then you will love this program! The characters and great as well!
B008XKSW7M|5.0|I was looking for something light and happy after a long work day.  This was a great movie.  Not too funny, just right.  Very well done and an accurate description before purchase.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I love this game it is my favorite my whole family likes it!!!!!!!GET THIS GAME ITS THE BEST!!!!!!!go horses!!!!!&bull;eggs h n f2f Dr th j :/ crab c r h huh synth shuts Honda even even evidence every man
B000N90JGI|5.0|I have watched this movie numerous times by accident as it appears on the Lifetime channel often as well.  Very good acting and a nice modeerate type of happy feeling throughout. Each time I see it, I still enjoy it.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|A clean positive show. I love it<br />I could be friends with any of the characters they are all so interesting
B00CHI5F5S|5.0|Great movie with great acting!  THis movie was so action packed that I couldn't take my eyes off the screen!
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|i will give it 10 more stars adding to it for now.  the movie was so great people in it
B00BGIC4I6|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies I've seen.  I could watch it over & over.  It explains married life to a &#34;T&#34;.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put it down.  The story line comes together in an interesting way.  I would read another one of her books.
0765325950|3.0|I was a little disappointed with the final installation of the WOT series. This after having read, and re-read all of the other books several times, was lame. I'm giving it 3 stars because it's not bad, but it's not the WOT I've been hooked on for years (even taking into consideration the change in authors).<br /><br /> The writing was good (I've read other works by Sanderson, WOT and others) but the whole treatment of the book felt rushed. I know, it's hundreds of pages long, but still. Or maybe it was more an issue of there being too many quick paragraph views into various character's POV. It was constantly jumping around, which can be better than endless pages of one storyline (Whitecloak chapters in earlier books were particularly grueling for me), but I felt like I never got to the 'meat' portion of the story. Every time it seemed like we were about to delve deeper into something, it jumped to something else.<br /><br />Also, the ending seemed very out of character for all involved. I won't go into specifics but it wasn't especially believable. And if that's how it was going to end, I think that more buildup and explanation were needed to prepare the reader for what would occur. As it is, I reached the final page with more of a &#34;That's it?&#34; feeling. Nice to have closure for the series, but was hoping for more of a satisfying end.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I've been waiting for this to come on Blu-ray/ Dvd!! I will be purchasing it soon~<br /><br />By the way. where are all you people seeing that it's 3D only? My page doesn't show that it is in 3D you must be looking at the one with the Wicked Witch on the cover...the one I am looking at is Blu-ray/ DVD + Digital Copy ._.
B000LJB9U0|5.0|The old impossible is now becoming possible.  Natalie Wood in her last performance with Christopher Walken. (except on the boat)
B009LH1Y1W|5.0|If you love action and suspens then you will love supernatural. Always keeps you on the seat of your pants and waitting for the next show.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|This series has more plot twists and surprises then you can shake a stick at. Always keeps you interested and wanting more.
B0002TT0NW|5.0|It is Harry Potter, need I say more? Harry potter is a great story that I am sure anyone would enjoy.
B008Y79IUE|4.0|I did like the movie because it does show where crazy bad decisions can lead at the worst case! However, there were parts of the movie that I about couldn't handle because some parts were really graphic and emotionally hard to handle!
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This was a great movie full of action humor. The story line was also interesting and I liked how it all connected. It was a great work of art!
B008XFJEE2|4.0|There were a lot of steamy and drama scenes that kept my interest but not really much of a story line!
B003SXHZF4|5.0|This is a great family film. I really enjoyed it :)<br />If you're looking for a good movie this is it.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I liked this book because it tells history of its time but with different stories of different people, so you can really feel what is happening. For me, it was a slow read, but I loved every minute.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game not bad lot of flying around destroying objects,even though I just<br />started playing the game,I recommend it if you like iron man!on kindle fire it<br />works great,no problems what so ever check it out

B00AYHKIZ6|5.0|Bowie is  back and this album may be his best in 15 years. A must  have for any true rock fan.
B0058SNI58|5.0|This is my first crocs via online purchase, it feels so good, but it is actually a little big, I am in size 6.5 normally, so I ordered size 7, big for me, I think, so if anyone to buy this, it's better to size down.
B00ALYY6ZA|5.0|Michael Mosley makes the case for using this method of achieving and maintaining health. He and his co-author share their own experiences along with testimonials from other early adopters. Fascinating research results from various scientists help to made trying this compelling to me.<br /><br />The authors provide many examples of ways to tailor this strategy to various scheduling challenges. They also include some recipes.<br /><br />After about a month of practicing this, I’m thinking it could last. Some weight loss and some struggling.  No medical tests yet to check for measurable results beyond the weight loss. Mostly it seems like a very reasonable strategy which, if the science proves true, will help me to produce improvement in my health.
145150506X|5.0|The perfect Edgar Allan Poe book.  It has all his stories.  It is a great read.  And I am glad I added it to my library!
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|This book is somewhat a coming of age story of two odd teens' first love. The family life of Eleanor will break your heart at some points, but the deep love she shares with Park will touch you. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a quirky love story. The only downside to this book is that the ending left me slightly unsatisfied.
0316286850|5.0|I love this book it has lots of information. and diffrent pictures .i do recomend this book because there is lot of stuff u could learn
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Anyone who hasn't downloaded this game, download it now. I guarantee you going to love it. I recommend everyone who doesn't have it to buy it!
B007REV4YI|4.0|Its a movie for the love of god, so what can be said about this other than it worked. OK
B007GCY8FS|2.0|Good start, bad finish..a little too preposturous and unreal. I lkie most of his work but this was sub par.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|Very long, a lot set up not enough action. Needed so serious editing. Just didn't feel it like LOTR. Maybe next one will be better.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Amazing deal at $32 bucks for Blu-ray Band of Brothers! If you haven't seen the series and love war documentaries this is an awesome purchase.
0718157672|3.0|As a salad addict, this book is superb, bringing combinations I'd never considered. His recent 15 minute book series make a good combo, although it usually takes me twice as long as he says. But that's okay.<br /><br />My complaint with this book is that it's hard to read and find what you want quickly. The layout is bad. As a 60 year old with fading eyesight the light grey text used means I have to read it under a strong light and strong glasses. The pictures are nice, but it's a terrible, impractical format for a recipe book. Some of his other books have similar issues. Written for young people with good eyesight. Maybe the Kindle version is better.<br /><br />Jamie 5 stars. Publisher 1 star.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|It is hard to find good books these days and this series has started out great! The back-story is compelling and the action speeds up in the last 1/3 of the book making you not want to put it down! I can't wait to read the rest!
B004KPX4W2|3.0|Actions and story line did not show me much me.  It appeared to be too fictional.  Acting wasn't all that great.
B0033AI4PM|5.0|I love this film and fell in love with Barbra afterwards..this blu ray edition is worth every cent...beautifully remastered sound & picture. I highly recommend purchasing this
B006GWO5NE|4.0|Fast shipping cable is not five ft more lik 3-4 great in conjunction with their charger love it works just as stated and charging is fast
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Sooooo fast moving!  But if you like the first one just get all three because the trilogy reads like one book and you'll need it immediately after reading the previous.
B00932A4XE|4.0|I enjoyed this movie.  The cast was incredible.  However, it was not as funny as they made it seem in the previews.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|There seem to be a few grammatical errors in all three books but very fun and fast moving.  You'll need a book cover or kindle so no one knows what you're reading!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|My daughter and I got addicted to this show and watched all the available seasons in a matter of weeks!
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|It was funny, if you like family guy you will differently like Ted and it had a creepy guy with a good ending
B008MPQ0R2|2.0|I am becoming very cynical about screenwriters who insist on directing AND producing.  Unless you are a Fassbinder or a Bergman, you need help to visualize the emotions and thoughts from your pages.  Both couples look, move, and speak alike and little passion or desire shows under their very reserved mannerisms. The best complement I can give is that the peripheral characters are trimmed down.
B0060AY6FO|3.0|This author gave it \\"a go\\" as the British say and didn't do a bad job, but it just didn't ring true for an avid Jane Austen fan who has read her works multiple times. Frequently, when the characters harken back to their past, the author lifts verbatim quotes from Austen's P&P. These quotes jump off the page as vintage Jane and by comparison, James' dialogue does not. I believe quoting P&P was a mistake. That all said, James wrote a good and interesting story and it was nice to re-visit the Bennett's and Darcy's for a time.
B008VBYN80|2.0|I love the gameplay and I have played it a few times a day.  The toughest currency to get is the diamond.  I was hoarding these in order to try to buy needed enhancements. Somehow the diamonds disappeared when an inadvertent button was accidentally hit.  I can't believe that programmers would not have enough intelligence to have a confirmation window.  I am steamed over this and uninstalled this flawed app.  I refuse to go social, nor spend a dime on the pay to win ponsi scheme.  Otherwise, the gameplay was great, but you will NEVER win without diamonds.
B004UHL9EK|4.0|I like having so many options in one app.  I set the alarm Monday through Friday for my work schedule and use the timer for cooking and that doesn't interfere with the alarm setting. I also use the stopwatch at work and like how it works.....the ringtone selections are great as well.
B000FCKGPC|4.0|It can be a little slow moving but this is a fantastic series if you enjoy good fantasy! Cannot wait to finish 5th book
B00499QUK2|5.0|Watch it. What more is there to say. I am a huge fan of Sherlock Holmes and was a fan of the Robert Downy Jr movies and my friend had to force me to watch these because I was so sure that they were going to suck. I mean, come on, a modern day Sherlock Holmes? So many things could go wrong. Well, they didn't, in fact I think just about everything went fantastic. The dry humor, the complicated plots, the references to the old Sherlock novels and so many inside jokes that even the passing fan can get some of them, it's just great. So if you haven't seen it, you should, you really, really, should.
B000002KIK|5.0|To anyone who liked Bkack Sabbath,{when Ozzys' voice was strong} This album is as good as any.If you've never heard it it's like getting a new album from a band that really rocks.
B008133MDK|5.0|I'm absolutely in love with this portrayal of Sherlock Holmes. Not only is it modern for a younger generation to really get in touch with, but they stay true to the heart of all Sherlock mysteries and are hilarious to boot. I can't wait for the third season to come out!!
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|I have seen this movie a few times. I love it. A really good story. Clint has aged, but still really has it.
B003F3NDOO|5.0|I think this show is hysterical. The title is completely unfitting for the show and suggests it is something that it is not.
B002QH2NUA|5.0|what else can i say? get it get it get it! the dvd is fabulous. Paul is fabulous, his band is fabulous. i love live music.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|My family really enjoyed watching this set. The Big Bang Theory is hysterical. I own every season available on DVD each one just as funny as the others.
B006OAB3ME|5.0|How could anyone not like something from Sir Paul? I can't wait for more music from him. He has a beautiful voice and nice lyrics.

B00C7JG0KG|5.0|What's up with you people wanting only the 3D Blu-Ray/2D Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack? If your wanting the 3D/2D/DVD combo for the 3D movie only then why don't you get the 1-disc 3D version with the Digital Copy. You don't need to have a movie with bonus features all the time that go behind-the-scenes or interviews. We don't need a 3-disc or 4-disc combo pack all the time and it does not need to be in 3D for every movie. 3D is not what keeps us alive you know. And they call it a pre-order because they want you to get your copy of the movie before any one else on the day it is released. If you wait for the day of it's release on June 11 the price will go down. And you never know a retail store like Best Buy, Target etc. might do an exclusive where that store only will have a 3D combo available in a limited number.  And Disney has announced that if you buy the 3D Blu-Ray or the 2D Blu-Ray, you can get the other one for only $5.99 plus shipping and handling.  Like if you buy the 2D Blu-Ray, there will be an insert offer in Blu-Ray that you can redeem to get the 3D Blu-Ray for only $5.99 plus S&H.
B00AOOIIVA|3.0|As an adult I found this movie entertaining, my older children sixteen and over did as well. My nine year old however was frightened by this film. I regret purchasing this movie, I should have rented it, as it will likely never be watched again.
B00AE9UYJ4|1.0|My son was not pleased with this game at all. It was not what he was expecting and we ended up deleting it,
B00BF2RTO2|5.0|Great to have this concert on DVD.The xtras are great also!the 12 wasted years is fun,wish they had a show from somewhere on tour though!!!
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Me and my friends play this a lot together. It drags a mob because everyone wants to see us play. It is surprisingly scary and addictive.When I play this at school everyone wants to play EVEN THE TEACHERS!<br /> NOTE: There are some glitches on where you fall off the map. I am not sure if that wad on proposed but if it isn't, then it should be fixed.<br />Other than that, worth your money.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Thor is very well played by Chris Hemsworth.<br />Actually all the characters are well acted, even the Destroyer!<br />The sets and scenery in Asgard are fantastic!<br />Wish there was more!!!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|The family's response strained credulity, but it certainly portrayed the weaknesses of our legal system. An enjoyable read if you're out of more substantive material!
B008645YH6|5.0|Marina Diamandis is one of the few artists who is truly passionate about not just her music, but the \\"whole package\\" of an album. Visuals and a consistent theme are evident in the Electra Heart campaign. She has delivered us a 2-year long story of a character with no backing down. She captured the archetypes images very well and is currently working on her third album.<br /><br />Highlights: Primadonna, The State of Dreaming, Sex Yeah!, Teen Idle, Valley of the Dolls, Hypocrates, Fear & Loathing<br /><br />Marina is the best artist out there right now. Don't miss out on this album if you're a fan of electro-pop music. On par with the quality of Britney's Blackout!
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This series of books was amazing. I loved the story flow and how all of the characters seemed to come alive the more I read.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|I thought it was a good story and kept your interest and the story flowed right along without losing the theme of the story.
B006YRVY2G|5.0|I've listened to it at least 10 times now, it really evokes the emotions of the TV series.  Wish some of the tracks were longer!
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|It was a good movie for all ages. Very funny and entertaining. I would recommend watching it.  Hope you enjoy it to.
B002N5N4M6|5.0|Received in 2 days and product has no problems. We really enjoyed the show. Thank you for everything.<br />Thank you again<br />Ace Weight
B001XV3LSS|5.0|I feel this was a great movie that makes us think and explore our feelings about not only who we are, but why we are. I read the book by Carl Sagan when I was in 8th grade and wished the movie would have been released before 1997. Excellent cast and crew with some good fx, but not enough to distract you. This is an old standby in our family view list, and every time we watch it, it opens up the door to some deep cosmic questions.
B000GYY9VQ|2.0|I had a problem with reading this book due to yellowed pages which made it difficult to read.<br />I believe the book is an excellent book and looked forward to reading it; however because of the print on yellowed pages, it is difficult to read.<br />I will look for the same book that is in better shape.<br />Thank You
B007W1BLN0|3.0|The concept for this film was valid, but this production wasn't for me. Too many &#34;flashbacks&#34; and not enough &#34;character building&#34;, left me guessing; was this man on a quest for an inner peace, or just a confused young man without a clue?
B00632HWOG|5.0|I enjoy my time every day when I get to sit down at the computer and see what's on my email. It's easy to attach pictures, etc. and keep in touch with my cousins around the country.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|I never saw Les Miserables in musical form so I was blown away by the story, songs and acting in this film.
B009R659L8|5.0|I was extremely happy with the story line and would like to read more of the same style in the future.<br />I put off reading this novel during vacation, but read it in just a few days from starting.  Good book.
B003TSEEDY|2.0|Bought this book because there was so much hype about it. Tried reading it three different times and could never finish. Couldn't finish the movie either. Just not that amazing.
B00APJLFEG|4.0|This is a cute movie and my daughter loves it! She watches it about once a month and runs around the house saying, &#34;I do not say Blah, blah, blah!&#34;<br /><br />I recommend it!
B0089LOKHG|5.0|Such a great book. This storyline is amazing and always keeps me guessing about what is going to happen to Lena. Love it.
B00BWJARHO|5.0|The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, is a great movie! It starts out with the same Bilbo Baggins from LOTR telling the story. The use of the same actor is very important to me. To the credit of Peter Jackson, he used a young Bilbo who could very well age to the same looks as the old Bilbo. Fantastic job in this regard.<br /><br />The animation of Smaug is fantastic! I can hardly wait to see all of his glory in the next movie.<br /><br />Some things I'm not too sure about is the introduction of the albino Orc. I'm not sure where this concept came from as if the book did not have enough going on. I understand the need for an enemy, but this enemy really came out of no where when compared to the book. With that said, the inclusion of this character did not take away from the movie. It basically made a central theme driving the dwarves and Bilbo through the adventure.<br /><br />Additionally, the introduction of the necromancer was also outside of the book. However, with the evil things going on in the movie and the book it gave some explanation to certain things not explained in the book.<br /><br />As always, Peter Jackson put together a fantastic fantasy in this movie. The entire storyline, including the added events, draw the viewer into the lands of middle earth. If I had one negative thing to say about the movie it would be that I wish they would have done this movie before LOTR. This is purely for flow and not because of contradictory elements within the movie. In fact, there are many references to events seen in LOTR.<br /><br />In all, great movie! I can hardly wait until the second one comes out and the extended versions hit the shelves. It will be on my must buy list!
B00BNXOMHA|5.0|The Twilight Saga has never looked better.  The movies were well done; much like the book but not as detailed.  I received the disc in a very short time.  Thanks for excellent service.
B008ASLK8A|4.0|It was a good sequel to the first one. I'm a huge fan of these movies and I see where they can go a great deal further with the story line.<br /><br />I recommend it!
B00BWJARHO|2.0|Not as good as LOTR.  My wife quite watching after the 1st hour.  I completed watching it but I am glad that I rented rather buying it.  I loved reading J.R.R. Tolkien as a boy and adult so I know this could have been so much better.  The first problem is that the movies pace makes it boring.  Second the battle gore is just too much and stops being entertaining.<br /><br />Great special effects and the beautiful New Zealand landscape just cannot save it.
B009G41CG2|5.0|It's different and harder than any I have seen before which makes it alot more fun to play. I'm loving it!!!
0307476073|5.0|This was a wonderful book; one of the best I've read in some time!  Cheryl Strayed has written a book that will touch and entertain you.  There are three themes to the story which are interwoven beautifully: her search to rediscover herself after traumatic events, the adventure of taking on an arduous physical and mental challenge, and an introduction to the wild Pacific Crest Trail.  I found this book to be inspirational, funny, sometimes scary, and surprisingly open and honest.
B008SAZHLQ|3.0|I think Eleanor and Park is just okay because I'm not really that in to romance novels. However I kind of like because Eleanor's background and family life is so intriguing and it pulls a different kind of reader into the story. I would recommend this product to people who like a suspenseful romance novel.
B0070DOHQS|5.0|I've used Splashtop Streamer for a while now and that's all I've known as far as using a remote app to access your pc.  Their security isn't too hot and when I did get the courage to try and check out my home's security cameras away from home I never could.  I could never hook up to my pc either.  I could only do so around the house which came in handy once in a while but totally defeats the purpose of being able to take your pc wherever you go.  I'm giving this app 5 stars but on a probationary period.  When I check out the remote capabilities by taking my kindle fire away from the house and seeing if I can access everything remotely I'll come back and subtract a star or not.  We'll see.  Right now from what I've seen it beats splashtop streamer hands down due to its user friendly interface.  So far so good.  I'll keep you posted!<br />Ok here it is on June 30th 2013 and this app passed all tests with flying colors! Quick hook up and everything working great away from home!  Definitely a keeper!
B008D36INE|3.0|It is hard to accept Hester's infatuation with Freddy. It would be, in my experience, an unsophisticated 16 year old. But I guess if you don't go full bore til later in your life this could happen. Weisz's acting was better than I have ever seen it before or since. The Judge was good with the face stuff--you didn't know if he was sad or disgusted or both which was perfect. Watchable. Interesting. I think she saw a ray of sunshine at the end which was also perfection.
1594202842|5.0|I have to say I cringed a little with some of the extreme positions taken by the author. That said, I must declare 2 things: I thoroughly enjoyed the book. Chua has some terrific insights and an admirable will to get the most out of her children, And I think she's honest about a lot of things, including at times her own folly. She self-reflects. The second thing is, the book is a very important warning to westerners who think that this totally permissive culture of ours is leading us down a happy path. Our children (GENERALLY SPEAKING!) are obese, spoiled, soft, entertainment-addicted underachievers. I have been a bit of a Tiger Dad in the last year or so, and it has not been easy, but we now have honor roll where before we had C's. I see confidence and enthusiasm, and a stronger desire to achieve. If Chua can at least inspire parents to stop raising latch-key kids, she's done her job. Regardless of how controversial her methods may seem, it's still a good read and very needed food for thought. Take it with a grain of salt.
1594746168|5.0|In the late 1870s, the son of a resurrectionist - body snatcher and grave robber - was enrolled at the Academy of Medicine in Philadelphia.  Spencer Black was a talented medical student with a special interest in mutation.  As the years pass, the young doctor's studies become more and more unorthodox, until he makes a claim that shocks the medical community: mythological creatures like mermaids, satyrs and centaurs once walked the earth, and humankind descended from them.  Ridiculed by his peers, Dr. Black persists in his belief, and spends the following decades attempting to re-create these ancient ancestors before mysteriously disappearing.<br /><br />The first half of \\"The Resurrectionist is a brief biography of Dr. Black, written like a historian outlining the basic life details of Dr. Black.  To me, it was just like reading the introductory essay in a museum catalog for an art exhibition - there's just enough detail so that the reader gets a general sense of what happened, but it's not a full-fleshed biography with all the answers.  There are a lot of unanswered questions raised by this section: what happened to Black's wife after she was horribly injured in a fire?  Why was his son described as a \\"sleepless man\\"?  Were Black's minotaurs and other fantastic beasts ever alive, or did he create composite creatures from corpses?  Were his \\"performers\\" real hybrid creatures?  On and on.  I liked the ambiguity of Dr. Black's work.  We know that he was a Frankenstein-esque scientist, performing gruesome and horrific experiments, but the exact nature of his surgeries is left unspoken, and the reader's imagination fills in the blanks.<br /><br />Of course, the real beauty and treasure of this book is the second half, which is supposedly a facsimile of sketches created by Dr. Black of his creations.  Eleven different mythological creatures, from sphinxes to sirens, are carefully dissected.  One detailed drawing shows the skeleton, the next the musculature, while another shows the creature whole.  It's just like looking at the pages of a particularly bizarre anatomy book.  Again and again, I was blown away by the details of the images.  They are so freakin' cool - the price of the book is worth it just for these drawings!<br /><br />The one thing that I found wanting was that Dr. Black failed to explain the age-old question: how do mermaids reproduce?  I had hoped for an image showing the sexual organs, just because I've always wanted to know if mermaids lay eggs or have live births!  But alas, this was omitted, and I am left to wonder on.shows the creature whole.  It's just like looking at the pages of a particularly bizarre anatomy book.

0316010669|3.0|Wow, everybody wants to write a book about this book. Here's a nice short review. It's a good read.<br />Will keep you engaged. Has very interesting and intuitive examples, but fails to provide any takeaways.<br />It's kind of like Freakonomics in that sense. You'll feel like its going to give you some kind of an edge, but it doesn't. In the end you'll be left thinking \\"so what\\"?
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is really cool!?!! The Japanese stuff is cooler than Sydney Australia,I think. The setting and tunnels are awesome too!
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I do like the story line; however, I feel the graphic description of each and every detail takes away from the story.  I think we all can picture what is going on without knowing which direction his finger was moving.  I am not a prude and like a good juicy story, but such in-depth details are boring me.

038572179X|5.0|My all-time favorite book.  I definitely recommend the movie, as well.  It's a sad, romantic love story-- but also so much more.  How much can one little lie change?  Read and find out!

B000AYELVA|4.0|Now before my 1st 20 years ago review for the month of May X2 I thought I would review the 1st X Men movie as a kid you know I was a fan of the animated X Men show I had a lot of the toys & of course I was a fan of the animated show from the 90's & I always wanted a movie made about The X Men. So in the year 2000 X Men was released in theaters. Now I do enjoy all 3 movies cause I can get some entertainment out of The Last Stand but I have my problems with it & it's not as good as the 1st X Men movies. But getting to this review X Men was directed by Bryan Singer who directed the sequel to this movie as well as Apt Pupil The Usual Suspects & unfortantly Superman Returns. It stars Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier, Ian McKellen as Magneto, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, James Mardsen as Cyclops, Famke Janseen as Jean Grey, Halle Berry as Storm, Anna Paquin as Rouge, Rebecca Romjn as Mystique & Tyler Mane as Sabertooth. The story is you start off in 1944 in Poland a boy named Eric Lehnsher who is seperated from his parents & they are being taken off to a gas chamber. This scene imo is better than X Men First Class where the guards are holding him back from getting to his parents & his mutant powers are triggered & he bends a metal gate the effects are so much better than those Secret World Of Alex Mack effects in First Class. So Eric goes on to become Magneto. Then you get to 50 years later you're introduced to this girl nmaed Marie who kiss her Boyfriend & she has mutant powers that that can take away peoples life force. It nearly kills her Boyfriend & he was put in a coma for 3 weeks Marie runs away from home & goes by the name of Rouge. She ends up in northern Alberta Cnaada she sees this cage fight going on where Wolverine is kicking a  s  s. Some guys start hounding Wolverine & pulls his claws out & The Bar Tender pulls a Shot Gun out on him Wolverine cuts it in 2. While he is leaving he discovers Rouge hiding in the back of his truck. He lets her go along. They areattacked by Sabertooth who works for Magneto but they are saved by Cycolps & Storm. Then you haved this Senator named Robert Kelly who wants to start up a Mutant Regerstration Program during the hearings he debates Jean Grey meanwhile you have Professor Xavier spot his old friend Eric & as you should know they have different view points Xavier wants peace with Mutants & Humans while Magneto wants a war. Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellen had a good back & forth with each other in these movies. I have heard people say Professor X & Magneto in X Men First Class was better I'm sorry but James McAvoy is a bad actor & Michael Fassbender is an overrated actor & that movie is a crime compared to what was told in the animated series. Then you get to the mansion where Wolverine comes to & tries to escape he looks for Rouge but meets Professor Xavier he is told that this is a school for mutants & how he can help him figure out his past. Meanwhile Magneto hatches this plot to capture Senator Kelly & another of Magneto's hench men Toad is flying the helicopter & Mystique a shape shifter turns into 1 of Senator Kelly's aid's. Magneto infects him with Mutant powers. He escapes & tells The X Men what Magneto is up to. 1 night Rouge hears noises coming from Wolverine's room she goes to check on him he accidently sticks his claws in her & she starts to absorb his power. Mystique transforms into this student named Bobby who is a love interest of Rouge's & tells her that everyone is mad at her & she should leave. Mystique sets up Cerebro the supercomputer of Professor X uses to kill him. Rouge is tracked down to a train station. The Professor has Cyclops & Storm go to get her he has Wolverine stay he fells that Magneto is trying to but Wolverine takes Cyclops motorcycle & goes to get her anyway. While he talks to Rouge Magneto shows up takes Rouge the police try to stop Magneto but that doesn't work out for them. When Magneto turns the cops weapons on them Xavier uses his powers to savethem. They figure out why Magneto took Rouge cause with her he can infect many people. Cause the machine he used on Senator Kelly nearly killed him. When The Professor used Cerbro it nearly kills him leaving him in a coma. You have the team suit up & go after Magneto. There is  this summit going on with all these World Leaders & Magneto wants to inffect them. The X Men fight off Mystique & Toad. Mystique transforms into Wolverine her & Wolverine have a pretty good fight. Meanwhile Storm,  Jean Grey & Cyclops have their troubles with Toad. Toad also spits some kind of slime into Jean Grey's face. Storm defeats & of course she has this stupid line. Then you have this scene where Mystique turns into Storm & she tells Wolverine they need to regroup but Wolverine knows it's not Storm by her scent & he stabs her in the stomach. Then you have scene that I felt this is what animated series Wolverine would say when Cyclops & Storm think Wolverine is Mystique & Cyclops wants him to prove it Wolverine says \\"You're a<br />d  i  c  k.\\" They get to the top of The Statue Of Liberty where Magneto traps them he also uses his powers to to move Wolverine's arms to his chest. Wolverine injures himself to break free has a good fight with Sabertooth he kills Sabertooth. Storm & Jean Grey compine their powers to get Wolverine to the top of the machine where he destroy's it & saves Rouge. Magneto is defeated you have Professor X tells Wolverine that there is this abandoned Military Base in Canada that might hold some secret of his past. The group find out Mystique is still alive & she is impersonating Senator Kelly. You have a great ending where you have Magneto tells Professor X that he will eventually escape & Xavier says he will be there to stop him. Now getting to the things I didn't care for they focused on Wolverine & not the entire X Men which they do a lot in all 3 movies  mainly in the 1st & 3rd. I didn't like what they did with Robert Kelly seeing as his character got important in the animated series. But the rest you had a cast that clikced well humor that worked good directing by Bryan Singer. Patrick Stewart was did a great job. Ian McKellen was great. Hugh Jackman pulled the role of Wolverine off so well. James Mardsen did a pretty good job. Famke Janseen was good. Halle Berry was decent. Anna Paquin was good. Rebecca Romjin was decent. Tyler Mane was ok. There isn't much more to say if you haven't seen X Men go see it along with the much better sequel X2. The next review will be 20 years ago X2 X Men United.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|While I enjoyed the final book, I have mixed feelings of the way it ended. Throughout the series I was always expecting a triumphant and redemptive ending for Katniss, but was disappointed with the way she was ostracized and had to compromise with her emotions.<br /><br />The series was very entertaining overall.
B0000BWVCM|4.0|Ok now I am going to review X2 X Men United for my 20 years ago-2003 in film review series to start off this is my favorite of all 3 X Men films I like the 1st movie I have issues with the 3rd movie even though I can enjoy it. Wolverine is ok X Men First Class or as I call it First Nap can kiss my a  *  *. Now X2 does what I want it to it. It is the closest we will get to the animated X Men show from the early to late 90's another reason I like this movie is cause it doesn't just focus on Wolverine as much more characters have a story. So this maybe another long review-retrospective. Directed by Bryan Singer again. All the main cast is back Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, Famke Janseen, Halle Berry, Rebecca Romjin & Anna Paquin. The newer cast consists of Brian Cox as Colonel William Stryker, Kelly Hu as Deathstrike & Alan Cumming as Kurt Vagner aka Nightcrawler. The story is Nightcrawler goes to The Whithouse tries to sneaks into The Oval Office it looks as if he is going to kills The P resident but he is shot by a Secret Service Agent but he left a note on knife that says Mutant Freedom Now. Meanwhile we learn that Jean Grey is having problems controlling her telepathic powers & is having a series of headachs. Wolverine has returned & is no closer to finding out his past. Then you're introduced to Colone William Stryker who has this ambition to kill all mutants. He he's been having Magneto drugged & he told Stryker where The Mansion is at. Mystique who has been posinhg as Senator Robert Kelly finds out where Magneto is being held at  as well as Stryker's plans. Jean Grey & Storm go to Boston to find Nightcrawler & Professor X & Cyclops go to see Magneto who is in prison. Wolverine stays behind to take care of the kids. Colonel Stryker has Xavier captured as well as Cyclops with the help of Deatstike. Meanwhile the mansion is under attack by Stryker's men. They have to get out of there Stryker's men manage to take some of the kids Wolverine runs into Stryker who starts talking to him the rest of the mutants are esacping Bobby puts a block of ice in front of Stryker & his men. They escape & take Cycolps's car. I did laugh at the part where Pyro turns on the radio & N Sync is playing Hugh Jackman's reaction is priceless. They get to Boston where Bobby lives 1 thing leads to another Bobby tells his parents about him being a mutant his brother who I guess is jealous calls the cops saying they are being held hostage. The Cops arrive Wolverine is shot in the head Pyro goes off & starts attacking the cops with fire blowing up cop cars Rouge grabs a hold of his leg & stops him. The Blackbird arrives they get out of there. Then they are followed by some Air Force Fighter Jets Storm uses her powers to cause the piolets to eject but 1 of them fire missiles at The Blackbird Jean causes 1 of the missiles to explode & tried to destroy the other 1 but it grazed the end of The Blackbird. Rouge is pulled out of The Blackbird & Noightctrawler teleports out of there to get her & bring her back Colonel Strker has Professor X & Cyclops who is being reeducted as he calls it. Stryker has his Son Jason who is drugged & totally messed up control The Professor he has had a 2nd Cerebro built & is going to have all the mutants killed. Magneto escaped from prison with Mystique's help they form a temporary alliance with The X Men. Through the reading of Nightcrawler's mind Jean finds out that Stryker's headquarters is in a Dam. Mystique sneaks in transformed as Wolverine she is caught she beats up the guards & allows the others to get in. Wolverine goes after Stryker he gets in a fight with Deathstrike & this fight was really good I wish it could've been longer but I liked what we hgot. Magneto, Mystique & Jean Grey go to get The Professor but they're attaked by Cyclops who has been brain washed. Jean tells them to go on  she faces Cyclops manages to beat him when she forces his own blast back at him & breaks the mind control that he was under. The Dam is about to collapse. Wolverine stops Stryker from escaping he messes him up pretty good Stryker pleads with him. He tells him he was  the 1 that wanted it done to him. Magneto finds where The Professor is at kills the rest of Stryker's guards Mystique turns into Stryker she tells Jason to kill all the humans. Magneto & Mystique leave & take Stryker's helicopter Pyro decides to join with them. With the help of Nightcrawler Storm goes into The Cerebro room saves The Professor. They try to escape The Blackbird is having problems taking off The Dam has burst & is flooding the area also killing Stryker. Jean gets out she uses her powers to stop the flood to allow enough time for the others to get out of there. So that meant we were going to get The Phoneix stroyling only not what me or anybody else wanted. The X Men go to The Whitehouse & tell The President that Humans & Mutants must work together to stop a war. Professor X supplies The President up of what Stryker was really doing. That's pretty much the movie. Now if I didn't do a good job explaining the plot in my review & retrospective then I'm sorry about that. Not much wrong with it other than Wolverine getting focused on but not as much as part 1 & part 3. BGut the cast is great & worked well yet again. Good fight scenes very good set up for The Phoenix stroyline which they should've done better. Bryan Singer did a very good job. Patrick Stewart was great again. Ian McKellen was great. Hugh Jackman did a really good job. Famke Janseen was good. Halle Berry was decent. Brian Cox did a good job. Kelly Hu served her purpose have a really good fight scene. Alan Cumming was good. Rebecca Romjin was fine again. Anna Paquin did fine again. Not much else to say it's a solid sequel better than the 1st. I was thinking about reviewing X Men The Last Stand I won't I'll save it for 06 in film. So next in this series will be 20 years ago Cliffhanger.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love Minecraft. But this game somehow takes the thrill of survival away. I went to make a wooden pick but i couldn't because it wasn't that high in updates. I love the creative too but i was wishing for a super flat world setting. Overall though this is a very good game. Thanks, Mojang!

B0070DOHQS|2.0|A moment ago I said: When you go to jumpdesktop.com to download your desktop app, it costs $30!<br /><br />WRONG. As N. Zalog pointed out, the $30 standard desktop client is another version of the remote app. Going to jumpdesktop.com/go lets you download the free HOST app. I downloaded and installed it on my Mac, no problem.<br /><br />So far, so good. Then (as it must), the new app asks me to turn on screen sharing, enter my gmail logon and password, and enter my Mac user id and password.<br /><br />The End User License Agreement says, \\"Irrespective of the place of execution or performance, this EULA shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the United Arab Emirates...\\"<br /><br />Trust is not given; it must be earned. The UAE has never done anything either to earn my trust or to raise suspicions. Of course this raises the larger point: how do I know where my most confidential of information is going? I mean, I'm sure several foreign governments could hack into my Mac if they chose to, but why would I volunteer to feed the maw of Eastern European gangsters?<br /><br />It just gives me the willies.

B0070DOHQS|3.0|Unlike Biau's full positive review, my experience was less than stellar. I am running an  Asus transformer prime w/ 16gb and Android 4.4.1 and my pc is running win 8 pro on a Intel I7 with 32GB ram.  The install went easily, although I did have to turn off nfl(?)<br />My first view was my desktop, well a cropped view, not all of my icons were visible.  I Opened my music files and opened a mp3 file.  It played good, but I couldnt find a way to termnate the song without exiting Jump.  I then tried an avi file.  This was so slow it looked like a slideshow. Same situation, I had to exit Jump to teminate.  Now I understand that some of the operation may be my lack of understanding this app, but first impressions are  important to me.<br />I should also point out that when a connection takes place, windows logs out the user.  When I looged back into my pc, the win 8 tile screen wasn't working properly.  I was unable to open any tiles until I rebooted.  I have yet to decide whether to uninstall the app,  I may look at the help and support areas on the web page, even though they use win 7 as their testbed.<br /><br />comments are encouraged.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is the best game on my kindle.I play it everyday.My mommy loves to play it with me so we can win coins .just wish there was more coins and you didn't have to win so much to get another player.But nice game anyways
B00C1BU7V8|1.0|I was really looking forward to watching this and it turned out to be a real snoozer.  Not only was it boring, the movie kept stopping to reload, what was that all about, Amazon?  I've never had that happen before.
0316228532|5.0|The product arrived in a timely fashion and the more I read this book the more I discovered that it was one of those books that's hard to put down once you start reading it. I believe that J. K. Rowling did well in this writing of her first adult novel.
B005HJWWW8|2.0|I am surprised by the relatively high rating for this device -- I found it to be a barely adequate booster (for a Sansa Clip Zip).  Seems like this unit that was likely created simply to fill a price-point/marketing niche rather than being a real innovative amp/booster design.  I wish I went with the E11 instead.  Another issue that annoyed me -- The E6 also uses the older (and less durable) mini-USB plug standard for its charge cable, rather than newer, more durable micro-USB standard that most of today's MP3 players have been using.  This not only makes it's recharge plug and jack less durable, but it also means that you have to be a bit more anal about your recharging config, so you can easily distinguish which USB pigtail goes to which device -- the two standards are not interchangeable.  Having to deal with a mix of both micro- and mini- USBs also makes it impossible to use a USB Y-splitter to reduce the need for using two USB ports for your media player/booster combo.  I know this is a pretty small issue -- but perhaps this info was helpful to some.

B000W8HC8I|4.0|Very interesting, very entertaining read. Amazing story and insight to what took place in the finance industry in the 90's...when you could get away with dirt like this.<br /><br />Wasn't very well written which leads me to believe that the author was incapable of making THAT much money in his career, but still a great quick read nonetheless.
B00006BSC8|5.0|I saw this movie years ago and to this date it has stayed with me.  I've only seen it once and everything about this movie was just so fascinating.  Leolo is a 12 year old boy who believes he is the result of sperm left on tomatoes and his mother falling in those tomatoes.  This is the beginning and it sets you up for how someone can be out of their mind and not know it.  His mean-spirited grandfather is just as insane... I am sorry, but I am writing this from my memory of at least 20 years ago. He is just starting to notice girls and spies on his next door neighbor.<br />But everything is told from Leolo's point of view.  And his point of view is wrapped in the blanket of insanity.  Maybe I like it so much because I was living overseas and I really got to understand foreign films.  This movie isn't afraid to explore some dark areas and it does have humor in it, but don't get me wrong, this movie is not a happy one.
B0000640VN|4.0|we had one part we had to see three times because the line was SO GOOD.<br />watch for the dinner date! it's the best.
1439156816|5.0|I blew through a post-it note pad marking earth-shattering passages, before just giving up and resigning myself to the fact that nearly every passage in this book was earth-shattering. I hate research; I hate studying; I despise looking anything up. Research to me, is the very definition of the word boring. When I get set on doing something, I just want to blast through it and get it done. When I read ‘On Writing’ I was working on my first attempt at a novel. I expected to pick up some useful information. I expected it to pack as much solid knowledge as a hefty textbook and be equally as dry. In fact, it not only held the knowledge of many textbooks, but the wisdom of experience. I did not expect to enjoy it. But I did; -immensely.<br /><br />In the content of this book, there was an assignment. That process made me completely and totally fall in love with writing. Immediately, a story grew and flourished in my thoughts. I couldn’t type fast enough to get it down. One thing that led to my industriousness, had to be the fact that I could simply do just as Mr. King said, and discover fossils as I moseyed along. There were no boundaries, and writing became way more entertaining that reading. It was challenging, fun, and an adventure. I'm now an addict.<br /><br />What a generous gift this book has been to me. It allowed me to discover the joy of writing. Thank you, Mr. King.

B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This was AWESOME! I am 34 and this book was like the best Video Game, RPG, Geek-convention, adventure novel all rolled into one. A zillion other people have already given this book glowing reviews, so I'll keep it short. This is not a literary masterpiece (ie-Clarke, Tolkien, Heinlein), but is more like a nice fudgy German Chocloate Cake. Super sweet, super satisfying, but probably not all that healthy for you. Decadent indulgence, enjoy!
B004Q7DQLS|5.0|Someone recommended this to me, and boy am I glad they did. The story drags and pulls you in to a world that keeps you guessing from one moment to the next. Well written characters and I can't wait to start the next book in the series!

B00AHTYI5M|4.0|\\"Argo\\" is Ben Affleck's third and most decorated directorial effort, winning an Academy Award for Best Picture and BAFTAs for Best Director and Best Film. It is a thriller based on the rescue of six American diplomats who escaped the occupation of the US embassy in Tehran, Iran in 1979. Following the Islamic Revolution, the US embassy is raided by protesters who demand that the United States return the ousted Shah to Iran to face trial. They held the embassy staff hostage for 444 days, but six of the staff escaped to the home of the Canadian Ambassador Ken Taylor (Victor Garber). A CIA agent named Tony Mendez (Ben Affleck) plans to exfiltrate the six Americans from Iran under the guise of a film crew. He enlists the help of Hollywood make-up artist John Chambers (John Goodman) who, along with producer Lester Siegel (Alan Arkin), create a film production that will serve as cover.<br /><br />\\"Argo\\" is essentially a competenet period thriller with a very conventional structure, but it has been praised to the heavens by some critics and criticized by others who see its timing as suspicious. \\"Argo\\" features some bad Iranians and was released around the time that Western rhetoric against Iran reached a level of belligerence not seen since 1980. Both the film's quality and its politics have been overstated, however. \\"Argo\\" is not anti-Iranian. It is sympathetic to the Islamic Revolution, though not to its methods, and it places the blame for Iran's troubles on Operation Ajax, the British and American effort that overthrew the elected government of Iran in 1953 and forcibly installed an unpopular Shah to protect Britain's oil interests in that country. \\"Argo\\" does not focus on Iranians, except to demonstrate the climate of fear, suspicion, and lawlessness that followed the Revolution. Based on what people who were there have said, this seems to be accurate.<br /><br />The facts of the rescue operation have been altered considerably, however, in order to create suspense. In reality, the six, accompanied by Mendez, sailed through the airport in Tehran without incident. There was no last-minute recall of the mission. The fake film crew never scouted locations. The role of the CIA was also enhanced. Those familiar with the operation, including former President Jimmy Carter, have said that the operation was primarily Canadian. The CIA played a junior role. Perhaps these changes are artistic license, taken in order to make the story more focused and suspenseful. But the film claims that the governments of Great Britain and New Zealand snubbed the six Americans, when actually those governments provided much assistance. Why lie about that when the issue is superfluous anyway? The result was condemnation from the New Zealand House of Representatives and Sir John Graham, Britain's ambassador to Iran at the time.<br /><br />There will always be different opinions on how accurate films should be if they purport to represent historical events. Affleck and screenwriter Chris Terrio also took the opportunity to take some light-hearted jabs at Hollywood in the scenes in which Mendez works with Chambers and Siegel to create the illusion of a genuine sci-fi action film entitled \\"Argo\\". This is the film's comic relief. The producer, Lester Siegel, is a fictional character, a stereotype of the world-weary Hollywood player, presumably included to give John Goodman someone to play off of. I like the period qualities of the film. It has good pacing and kept my interest. But I couldn't help but cringe a little every time I noticed this story being straight-jacketed into a very conventional formula with a lot of stock characters and looseness with facts that aren't always a good fit.reality, the six, accompanied by Mendez, sailed through the airport in Tehran without incident.

B00006AW2G|5.0|I originally bought this record in April 1975.  Then in April 2013, I decided to buy it again on a remastered CD.  I always thought that this album was great.  It contains 3 countrified style songs. Now it's time for me to review each song as follows:<br /><br />1.  \\"Gimmie Shelter\\"...This is probably the VERY BEST song & MY favorite song, that the Rolling Stones ever recorded. It is very unique & it also had such an eerie feel to it. Though a small hit, however, I really wish it was a much BIGGER hit single, because it's just that GREAT of a song. I also wanted to add that Merry Clayton is the back-up vocalist here.  In 1970, she also recorded HER OWN version of \\"Gimmie Shelter\\". And she also performed the song \\"Yes\\" on the 1987 movie soundtrack \\"Dirty Dancing\\".<br /><br />2.  \\"Love In Vain\\"...After all these years, it looks as though this song HAS finally GROWN on me. At one time, I really COULDN'T stand this song.  But now, I like the softer guitars & the countrified vocals on this tune.<br /><br />3.  \\"Country Honk\\"...This is the COUNTRIFIED version of 1969's \\"Honky Tonk Woman\\"  This is another song that I wasn't too crazy about @ first either, but it grew on me, real fast as compared to \\"Love In Vain\\".  This song is fun & rather AMUSING to listen to.<br /><br />4.  \\"Line With Me\\"...I've always liked this song, quite well. Beat wise, it could almost remind me, somewhat, of \\"Bitch\\" from 1971's \\"Sticky Fingers\\" album<br /><br />5.  \\"Let It Bleed\\"...The TITLE TRACK, which I always got a big charge out of. It's another one of those songs, that I found quite amusing, w/ the music & lyrics @ times. And I really love the drumming & cymbal clashes @ the end of this tune.  In the mid 70s, I read that THIS song was either tied in with.....Or.....a follow-up single to the 1970 hit, \\"Let It Be\\", by The Beatles. I really couldn't say, in my honest opinion, because BOTH of these songs are ENTIRELY different from each other. \\"Let It Be\\" is quite a pretty song, & \\"Let It Bleed\\"is a rather comical song.<br /><br />6.  \\"Midnight Rambler\\"...On my review of Aerosmith's 1973 debut album, I remember saying that THIS song could remind me of \\"One Way Street\\" in certain parts. I always thought THIS was a real DECENT tune. The 8 min. 23 sec. LIVE version of \\"Midnight Rambler\\" is also pretty good...& recommended for one's listening pleasure.<br /><br />7.  \\"You Got The Silver\\"...Keith Richards performed the vocals here. THIS song could remind me, somewhat, of \\"You Gotta Move\\"...also incl., on the \\"Sticky Fingers\\" album.  But \\"You Got The Silver\\" is ten times better, by far. It is also the very shortest cut on this album.<br /><br />8.  \\"Monkey Man\\"...This song is also pretty good, I've always enjoyed this one.<br /><br />9.  \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want\\"...Another fantastic classic here. It features the London Bach Choir, Doris Troy (of \\"Just One Look\\" fame) & etc. Even though, this song was released in 1969, it didn't become a hit single, until almost 4 years later. It was the SPRING of 1973, when I FIRST heard THIS song on the radio. Then I immediately went out & bought THIS 45 rpm record. On the Flip Side, was \\"Honky Talk Woman\\" & I remembered it, BIG TIME, from the Summer of 1969.  BOTH of these hits singles were great.<br /><br />This Stones album was always one of my favorites.  And this album is highly recommended.

B00CEF014E|4.0|SOLSTICE is a compelling, page-turning thriller, and it adds an overlay of suspicion that there's something more here than just the thrill of the plot and the danger.  As Dana seeks to find the man in her life who has mysteriously disappeared, she is led to a compound inhabited by a cult embracing medieval religious beliefs along with her sister whom she trusts, but she soon finds it difficult to trust anyone. With her survival in the balance, her resolve to live pits her against dastardly odds in an incredible dystopia.  Once you start the book, block out enough time to read it all the way through.  You won't want to put it down.
B00BMKDTNC|2.0|After 20+ years of reading a series, I found this book to be less than satisfactory.  It is over and there is closure.  It should have been great, but it simply wasn't.  It was like he had a check list;  kill off a main character so I can have sorrow, create a ridiculously long battle so I can have action, let Rand live in an unlikely way so that I can seem clever.  Let Harriet edit it and try to seem like Jordan.  Just wasn't very good.

Anywho, book has great ideas, clearly they don't apply, or the publishers don't think they do, to book sales.<br /><br />Great stuff, I like how it's presented for the most part.<br /><br />Bottom line: at times it's a bit Tipping Point-y, with long, sometimes boring anecdotes just to say -- givers do better in the long run, so be or learn to be a giver. If you want the meat of it, that's it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series - it is superb.  And I am so completely in love with the ability to view it wherever I want - whenever I want.  DELUXE.
B000068TPN|5.0|Very close to real for anyone interested in how this era of our involvement in Vietnam happened to men on the ground.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Great read for all ages--well written, imaginative.  The movie is equally entertaining.  A worthy novel for discussing and sharing with friends and family.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|I really liked this book even though it dealt with teenage suicide.  It made me really think and I had a hard time putting it down.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Bought all three, Love them. I to find me time so I could keep reading. wish there was a forth.  Bev
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I wasn't crazy about the very beginning or the very end but everything in between was wonderful.  Can't wait to see the movie.  Hope it's as good as the book.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Bought all three, Love them. I to find me time so I could keep reading. wish there was a forth.  Bev
B005LAII12|5.0|This is such a funny movie it always makes me laugh. Mark is one of my favorite actors. love it
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|I was sadly disappointed with this movie.  I expected so much more.  Paul Rudd needs to stick to acting and let someone else do the storyline/producing.  The basic premise was a good one, and there were some okay moments in the movie.  All in all though, I felt like I wasted 2 hrs.
B007EC27QM|5.0|This is really a super calculator for my use.  I take it with me when I shop and it really helps me keep to my budget.  Thanks for a really great app at a really great price!
B008YKGQR4|4.0|LOVE that I can see Facebook as I see it in a computer, sometimes just need to use the whole Facebook and not just the mobile version.
B009GI8J1O|3.0|I stuppose it is silly to add a review to the hundreds already written, but here goes anyway. The most difficult thing in reviewing this book is how to rate it.<br /><br />The first story is totally marvelous, right on a par with Jack London. Fascinating and extremely well written in the best of the prose of those times.<br /><br />The second is about a young musician and composer. The writing is brilliant and also very amusing at times (\\"...farmers are worried about the harvest, but show me a placid farmer and I'll show you a sane conductor.\\").  His adventuress in Belgium with an old and fading composer are intriguing, and part of the narrative is a number of the young man's letters that include these interactions as well as his feelings.<br /><br />These two stories, which I would gladly rate with six stars, are also continued and concluded at the end of the book. Could not ask for a better read than these novellas.<br /><br />Unfortunately, they are followed by two more than I could only rate three stars, and that is generous. The first is a thriller of sorts with mostly an improbable plot and stock characters: the evil capitalist head of an atomic generating plant that is about to blow California to smithereens, a cold-blooded hitman, a grouchy editor with a heart-of-gold, and a girl reporter who will probably solve the whole thing.<br /><br />The forth novella is about a grossly sarcastic, grouchy and unpleasant publisher who ends up in a nursing home from hell. I could not care a bit what happened to him. Best I could do would be to rate this two stars. The conclusion at the end of the book was somewhat more interesting with far fewer boring and repetitious sections, but still not anything even close to the first two stories.<br /><br />All four of these stories are resumed at the end of the book, each to a logical conclusion. The ratings remain the same as above, with the first two being outstanding, although the second novella had a tragic ending.<br /><br />The next, for some inexplicable reason, is a first person account of noting much I could ascertain, but I gave up on it about a quarter of the way through.  It is in the first person, in some incomprehensible dialect that I could not decide is it was supposed to be just old-time Southern, Caribbean or perhaps something from the depths of Africa, for all I know. I could care less. Unlike the first (and last) four, I could see no connection, whereas the others did have some tenuous relation to each other.<br /><br />The next was some sort of science fiction about which I could not understand a bit, nor care. Fifteen or twenty pages of this depressing drivel and I gave up and moved to the next story. This, and the one above, I would rate about minus one star were it available.<br /><br />This brilliant and gifted author could easily have had a great book here had he stayed with what he did best, but for reasons best known to him, he included so much that was objectionable, boring and irrelevant that it ruined the experience. He is badly in need of a stern and uncompromising editor that could remove all the dross and instead of more than 500 pages, whittle it down to a lean, and excellent 300 or so.<br /><br />I would still have to recommend this for the enjoyment of the excellent stories with the caveat that one should be prepared to quickly page through huge sections of abject boredom, and also skip the two middle stores altogether. You would miss nothing and be able to read a book that made sense, albeit in an unorthodox fashion.>The next, for some inexplicable reason, is a first person account of noting much I could ascertain, but I gave up on it about a quarter of the way through.

B000FC1PNE|5.0|I am hooked on this series... no, I am truly hooked on this author.  I absolutely love the sense of humor that Julia Quinn puts in her books.  I have found myself laughing out loud while reading her books and it is wonderful.  The Bridgerton series is so fun to read and I have looked forward to reading the next one each time I have finished one.  This one in particular was very good and after a stressful day at work or on a long (or short), boring flight, these books are exactly what I need.
B006NFKUF6|5.0|This game will show you the true meaning of being a ninja and learning about their honor of fighting it also reminds me of ninja turtles
B0055PGUYU|4.0|For me, Duhigg`s The Power of Habit was an important and refreshing find. It's not that I agreed with every perspective shared; but yet, appreciated the logical patterns and found the ideas, inspiring. The format of the book made its clarity and easy-read and references also pleasurable. Some of the twists and turns, and definitely, the business comparisons were least inventive- but how welcome to have them all in one book! Kudos, Sir! Encore!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Even if you don't like zombies (uhm, who doesn't like zombies?!) this show is awesome!  Great characters, plot, suspense.....<br />Can't wait for Season 4!!
B009IEXKXI|4.0|The ingenious survival adaptations by the principal character are almost endless, so much so that it is almost fatiguing at times. However, the mix of humor and emotion into the technical soup gives the story a warmth that makes it all very worthwhile. My one gripe is the overuse of profanity; it adds nothing to the story.
B0034DGPEU|3.0|The themes in this book are familiar and left me wanting more and deeper development.  The characters and the setting were well-drawn and interesting.  My favorite character was Mae and my least favorite was Marshall.  We never quite understand Marshall's behaviors, or what motivates or softens him.  The reader is left to fill in the true character of Marshall, Mr. Rankin, Mr. Waters and also \\"the captain\\".  They as well as Belle, Jamie and Miss Martha all seem to run wild. Why does Lavinia, the main character, just let life wash over her.
B004IWF64Q|5.0|This has been the kids choice and they've enjoyed it. Both the story line and picture quality are great too. The total running time is just right to hold their attention for the entire period.
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|This game plays quickly, is simple to learn, but has a lot of depth in deducing the actions and cards of your opponents.  This is a great game that I think a wide variety of people can enjoy.
B001JIA5TS|5.0|good plot,good performing by Bred Pit,and Robert Redford,and good show at important people in our life,take care of people not money....
B00BTYP6QE|4.0|I really enjoyed this app. Just as fun as the first two. I can't get enough. I hope they keep them coming.<br />Sharondesigns@gmail.com
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a challenging game.  I like doing it as quickly as possible.  It is good that we can remix the tiles around.
B008Y79IUE|2.0|Artistic, yes, but I'm not sure what the point was. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood for such disturbing imagery. I did really like the quick sequences of images and sounds to illustrate getting high without actually showing it.
1451695195|5.0|I read lots of near death experience books this one is very good. I liked it because Eben was a non believer until this experience and now there is no doubt in his mind. The part where he saw prays going up to heaven as murky mud bubbling bothered me because I always picture prayers going up as beautiful beams or some sort of brightness. I then had the thought that maybe he saw them this way because he was a non believer at the time.<br /><br />His son Bond was a brave little boy watching his dad go through all of the trama going on with his dads body that I named my new puppy Bond. I had lots of auhah moments reading this book. I read it on the plane. Being in the clouds and seeing our earth from above while reading about Heaven was awesome.
0385528752|5.0|A Worthwhile Read.  Everyone should find some ideas of value in this work.  Change is always hard but techniques and solid examples are well worth your time.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I read it in 5 hours. Amazing! I could not stop reading it, it automatically captivates you. Did I say it was AWESOME?!
B007URVZJ6|3.0|Microsoft Word is a difficult platform to use for Kindle submissions. There has to be a better way and this work doesn't suggest one.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Never watched these on HBO but am now addicted!!<br /><br />It seems to get better as the seasons go! Excellent all around!
0345803485|5.0|Exciting, tantalizing, the beginning of a love story and how love can change us if we let it to make us better.<br />This is not an S&M story!  It is good reading.
B00000ILDF|5.0|Needed this and the last Alien to complete my collection and was happy I could find them here. Love these movies and now my set is complete.
B005HSL626|4.0|My little granddaughter really enjoys using my Kindle to play this game.  We limit her to 15 minutes on it, and that way it increases her dexterity but doesn't anesthetize her brain.
B001HN69AY|5.0|My wife loves this movie so it was a gift for her. It was his last movie too so it's a great addition to our collection.
B00338QENI|5.0|I wish this was mandatory in all class rooms<br />in all countries.<br /><br />Words cannot express the pleasure in reading<br />this.<br /><br />Reminds me how lazy we can become.<br />Read IT.
B004F1F32A|4.0|Story has a simple plot, but the action scenes make it great. Neeson's daughter is taken by bad<br />guys and put in a underworld prostitution ring. Neeson kills all the bad guys and gets his<br />daughter back.<br />Liam Neeson is awesome. The fight scenes are great. It does help make older teenagers<br />more aware of some of the dangers of trusting strangers. Probably not suitable for kids under 13.<br /><br />Overall, a  great action movie.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|It is great fun and relaxing when you are riding in the car or sitting in your living room listening to music.
B000E1YVZU|5.0|I love this movie. I lent it to a friend years ago and I STILL haven't gotten it back, so I'm repurchasing. The story is beautiful and I'll never get sick of the soundtrack!
B008P9M614|5.0|If you're a fan of House, this is the set for you. It includes every season of the show and the bonus features that go with each season. The box is attractive, and as an added bonus, you also receive a small booklet with even more information about the show. As I said, if you're a fan, this set is for you. Toss it in your cart and enjoy hours of entertainment with TV's angriest doctor.
B000HL09MG|5.0|This movie is a classic, if you're of age I suggest that you watch it! You can't go wrong with Tom Cruise!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is interesting to say the least. The author does a great job at taking your emotions on a ride! I have very little time to read, and this was a page turner!
B009K0P10K|5.0|Each episode keeps me on my toes. It gets more and more tangled with secrets coming out how will it end up?
B00A0HQ9GM|5.0|Gorgeous moody tunes. Lana paints a lush landscape of sounds. An excellent deal getting two albums for the price of one and half.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I am totally Hooked on this show! I came to the party late but am all caught up now and ready for season 4!
B0064MGU98|5.0|I was hooked after the first episode. Most women will love this series and the characters are well cast and very dynamic.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|I am so thankful for the smartphones we have on the market today, for if there were no smartphones, there would be no Amazon Mobile app.  That said, I have this app on all 3 of my devices, my Samsung Galaxy SII  Epic Touch 4G/D710, my Samsung Galaxy Tab 7\\" tablet, and my Asus TF300T Transformer 10\\" tablet, its one of those apps that you never knew how you lived without it.  For me, when ever I am out and about, and I may per chance find something I am looking for.  Well now, I just bring up my Amazon Mobile app, being as the app will work on 3/4G and/or WiFi, I'm never without my trusty Amazon Mobile app.  I can open open the app, log on, search for whatever it is I'm drooling over at the time, if I can get it cheaper on Amazon, and chances are I will, if it is something I absolutely have to have, I can order it on the spot, and have it in my hands in a matter of days.<br /><br />If you are on the go, or out and about, if you are anything at all like I am, and this goes for you guys, tools, yea Amazon has ALL kinds of tools, electronic gizmos and gadgets, which I'm a sucker for, Amazon has all kinds of electronics too.  Now you don't need to be on your home computer to satisfy those impulse purchases, or that late night gift for your wife or girlfriend.  You can do it all from the comfort of your smartphone.
B000W4KT6E|1.0|After receiving this product i realize it was scratched very badly so I didnt get the enjoyment out of it, I wrote back to amazon explaining and they never answer me back, my money has totally gone down the drain just like that.  Now am reconsidering if I should ever order anything more through Amazon.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|can't stop playing this game. hard to put down once you start. great that I can play on my tablet, phone or laptop.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Always changing up the story.  Never know where it is going next.  Keeps you in the book!  Love the book!
0871164566|4.0|She does a beautiful job describing how to do the wire wrapping of various pendant styles.  Can't wait to do them.
B00BWBHIUG|1.0|Very disappointed.  Game keeps saying server not connected.  Have reloaded it three times on my Kindle Fire.  If no star was possible that is what I would give it.
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|This is probably one of the better games for the kindle fire for some of the more hardcore gamers out there. It is still very simple, pick up and play for a while or stop if you are just trying to pass the time; however, it can get very in depth as well. It is a puzzle adventure game. The process is very similar to Puzzle Quest, you get resources and attack by hitting certain blocks in the puzzler.<br /><br />You can use your experience to upgrade your skills, and unlock rooms with more upgrades for your character. Once you get the magical 10,000,000 points you are free from the dungeon. This game is very simple but gratifying where you can put as much time or as little as desired.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|This is a really good book. I will not spoil it for those who have not read it, but if you like mystery or books with magic you will like this book.
B008I34YYY|5.0|Steampunk and Nazies on the dark side of the moon WOW! Very good effects, good plot. Captured my attention throughout.
0060254920|5.0|A wonderful present and lovely book and story. A recommended book for children 5 to 6years. Lovely illustrations for children to enjoy.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Love love this game! So many different possibilities for creativity!  Kind of like a virtual lego game! My only want would be to be able to pick my own avatar.  I (female) along with my two daughters play together all the time and we want to be girls on the game. Not a huge importance seeing how I love the game anyway but it would be fun!!! Thanks!!! ;-)
0399226907|5.0|Beautiful story for young children with lovely drawings.  Defnitely a must for little ones.Will recommend it to parents of ages two to six.
B009R659L8|5.0|This book rates right up there with her first novels in suspense, intelligence and pure enjoyment. Kept me guessing till the very end
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Really good GAME AND I'M sure you are looking for a lot of people who want to get this game get this game IT is so ******* awesome get this game IT is so awesome people
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Nicholas Sparks is one of my favorite authors and he didn't disappoint me this time either.  We knew someone had to &#34;give up&#34; but, as always, it is hard to figure out who.  He really did a tremendous job and I will be a fan for life.  I read this on my tablet and it was a great experience.  Of course I got it immediately and started to read right away.  Thanks, good job.
B000JCSBU0|5.0|This movie starts off slow, then seems to accelerate, spiraling quickly towards its extremely tragic end. It will keep you - for lack of a better cliche - glued to the screen.<br /><br />Don't do drugs.
1449410243|5.0|If you know cats, this is a very funny book!  The pictures and sayings are great! Just a light-hearted look at cats!
B004J4WN0I|3.0|But it was entertaining, it's funny I take no issue with a talking dog at all, in fact I enjoy that aspect. It's just some times the dog has no understanding of what is said, then later spouts off some piece of modern slang or complex understanding of pop culture. There seems to be a little inaccuracy, But I will read the next one and probably the one after that.
B009GJBBDQ|2.0|This is easily Brosnan's worst bond movie. Probably because the best actors and actresses in the film aren't used. You have Judy Dench in your movie and you basically write her out? It is also the least believable bad guy of any bond film as well as the most unbelievable plot line (and that's saying something from a franchise with historically porous plots already!)<br /><br />This is a movie for one of those lazy Saturdays where you will probably fall asleep watching it anyway (especially when you watch it for free on prime like I did). Take it from me, you don't need to see the ending.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I hadn't seen the movie,not at all what I expected. So much more and better! I coul not put it down.
B002R2B6NE|4.0|This is one of the biggest surprises I have been given from a movie in a long time. When I watched it I didn't think too much about it, only to find out that it is well acted, and scripted. Its very believable and its very difficult to tell what will happen next. I was genuinely surprised at the ending!<br /><br />This is a classy suspense movie. It doesn't offer cheap thrills, instead it works to make you believe that the ending deserves to be there. Curl up with your sweetheart and enjoy the story!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|A great romantic story with an exciting and gripping twist. I wanted to read it in one day but tried to savor it!
B005K17RU0|4.0|I give this app 4-stars because its a nice app but ALOT of things are do it your self. but the locations are ALMOST spot on, so for instance you have to type in your location and then it gives you varying choices but sometimes it doesn't have where your coming from or where you shearching for. I use this app a lot and like it a lot so you should have fun with it like I do its a nice weather app! p.s. I am 12 not 13-&uarr; :) (: thanks Chloe
B00846REIS|4.0|Entertaining story that really holds your interest and makes you want more! Not just a \\"fifty filler\\"! Can't wait for book three.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This book has been amazing and inspirational for me at hard times I would just pick up one of the books and read away my troubles if not for the hunger games I would not have  been able to make I  through seventh grade this is one of my favorite series so thank you,Suzanne Collins for right in f2f the hunger games and helping me through seventh grade. I can't wait to sing in the meadow to my children.
B005PK57IK|5.0|This is a very engaging, interesting group of characters, with smart dialog and interesting plots. Each episode leaves the viewer wanting to watch the next one.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Wow. That's one word I would use to describe this book. This is a beautifully written story and heartbreaking too. This is an experience you will never forget.
B002CLBJPK|5.0|great movie that my son loves, he's almost 21, came in great condition and nothing wrong with the disc, thanks.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This  game can be really fun when I'm bored but ya its a really entertaining and so u should get it and its only free now thats cool
B001XV3LSS|5.0|This is a little slow to start, but gets better and better.  The actors are good in this movie and you will enjoy it.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Recommended for all lovers of running, including those just thinking of ultramarathoning. Well-written, engaging and inspirational. Great historical and geographical information. Even has Deena Kastor!
B009A9ETFE|5.0|Loving all of their hits songs in one CD!!<br />This brings back so many memories! God I love this band!!! &#60;3
B005OCHOZS|5.0|Captivating narrative of the life of one of the world's greatest runners. Poignant, sad, funny and thought-provoking. I came away with a love and a deep respect for Scott. Recommended for all, particularly those with a runner's spirit.
B00BQHA06A|5.0|There has never been a CD that HIM has come up with that i dont like!<br />Love the new songs!! now i cant wait to see them in concert on May 11th!! &#60;3
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|It was great to see how they got back together and share with there fans the up's and down's of there relationship and howthey got back togehter.It was quite a roller coaster ride.We were glad that they are still putting out music.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I really like that this app has a radar. Nice feature. I also like the hour by hour weather forecast.
B008OJ291W|5.0|I Really enjoy the re-master of these great Hit's Jeff Lynne is still at the top of his game and knows what sounds great These songs are  as good today as they were when they were released when they were for the first time...
B00022GJ4M|5.0|This album would give a dead man a rise! Take a blues master, put him in a studio with a killer backup band and let the magic happen! You can hear the energy created in the empty spaces between songs while the musicians joke around! The classic songs updated for all times!
1439102732|5.0|The book shifts perspectives by chapter & person, basically telling the same story from three people's point of view. It's a great story!<br />The main character works as a music therapist, which I also am, so I appreciate my profession being portrayed in a positive manner.
B001AQR3JY|5.0|I purchased this movie for my son, who is grown and loved this movie as a child.  Of course, once he received this movie he had to watch it.  It was like he was a child again.  Received as expected and earlier than expected.
B00821OW8K|1.0|I came late to this series and only watched the premier because a family member thought it might be worthwhile. As it turns out... the unanimous verdict was \\"let's not waste another hour.\\" There's not really much to say about this feeble effort. The acting is wooden, the dialog is hilariously impoverished, every clich&eacute; is wheeled out in turn. This is just another zombie apocalypse series with CGI aliens substituting for flesh-eating humans. What struck me as most interesting was that the much-feared mythical electro-magnetic pulse wiped out not only modern electronics (despite the fact extensive research has shown the myth of the EMP: stuff works just fine) but also wiped out excess fat (everyone is slender in the series, whereas in real life everyone is either fat or obese) and, most amazingly of all, also wiped out the classic Boston accent. So the gallant band of survivors heads for Marblehead instead of \\"maahblehed.\\"<br /><br />In short this is just another boring me-too apocalypse-with-guns tedious imagination-free CGI rehash with nothing whatsoever to commend it. I can't imagine why anyone would watch this stuff when there's the option to go out for a walk or a run, play chess with a friend, or read a good book. Life is too short to waste on pointless uninspired mechanical Hollywood pulp like this awful series.
B00447G29S|5.0|I purchased this as a gift for my mother.  She had never seen this movie and really enjoyed the quality of this product.  I would recommend this movie and this seller.  Received earlier than expected.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Downton Abbey was very well done.  The characters, the plots, and the scenery are all superb.  We look forward to enjoying Season 3 and 4.
1449410243|5.0|This book is printed on thick, water resistant paper so don't be afraid to read it wherever you go! The included comics are hilarious and many have a certain moral lesson to teach. The Oatmeal is a wonderful author and I would recommend buying his other published books to help support him!
B005S9EKCW|5.0|I bought for my wife who had seen it multiple times in the theater. A must own movie for any household. The best part about this copy is you basically get 3 copies of the movie. My wife put the digital copy on her Ipad and we keep a copy with the standard DVD player and then we keep the other copy with the blu-ray player. I recommend getting this version over the standard because you get more for your money even if you currently do not have a blu-ray player.
B003Y5H57E|5.0|Such a great movie! Great plot and actors good for girls night and even the bf doesn't mind watching it.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|I watched this movie because of all the hype it received and it lived up to it. Worth the 2.5 hours.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I just got my case today and I love it. Top notch quality. I expect it to last a long time
B000QCS8TW|5.0|This is my second reading of the series, which is easily my favorite books I've ever read. Everyone should at least give this series a try.
B00BSBT8M6|1.0|this movie was long and boring, would not recommend this to any one. a real sleeper. If you have hours to waste of your life watch this.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|i love playing this game! Very addicting and very easy to play. My kids even like to help daub numbers.
B005HSL626|5.0|thanks for offering this free, works fine on my little ipad thingy. my son really loves playing this game. A+++
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|I started watching this show on Netflix and was blown away by it.  What drew me to it (other than the really attractive Anna Silk/Ksenia Solo team-up) was that it featured creatures from folklore and myths from all over the world.  It's easy to empathize with the characters.  Anna Silk's portrayal of Bo is great.  But I would have to say that my favorite character is Ksenia Solo's Kenzi.  She's funny, witty, and adds a little extra 'oomph' to every scene she is in.  Plus, I knew someone who acted just like her, so it was easy for me to enjoy Kenzi.  I highly recommend this to anyone who enjoys shows about folklore and myths.
B0063IH60K|5.0|thanks for offering this free, works fine on my little ipad thingy. my son really loves playing this game. A+++
B00AIUUXHC|2.0|I played this game for a while and got my first shark leveled all the way up. Exited the app to &ccedil;heck facebook and h&aacute;d to start all overr again. Every time i leftt the app it reset. Dont recommend for kindle fire.
B00136JS12|5.0|A great album all around from one of the definitive bands of classic rock. So many great songs on this album.
B006TF6WAM|5.0|Really gentle read.  Good insight into human psyche, while being filled with lots of humour.  Would be a really nice holiday read.
B0076XIS4O|5.0|Grimes really comes out as a masterful composer in Visions. Her music is like a symphony wherein each track has a birth life and death of it's own. She has incredible natural talent at blending hooks and melodies, again it sounds like a modern orchestra and not like simple songs. I'm sure it's harder than it sounds but it makes me want to pick up some electronic production equipment and give it a whirl. I can't wait to hear what she comes out with next, and see her live! Side note: if you watch any interviews with her she is very very humble and I really think she doesn't know how talented of a composer she is which just makes listening to her music that much better.
B00846REIS|5.0|I loved this book! Tried this book because I thought it would be similar to the Shades of Grey trilogy, but actually may have liked this better. Can't wait for June when the last book in this trilogy comes out!
B00BQI4AU6|1.0|UPDATED 2/16 WOW !!! Look at all the butt hurt cry babies out there. you people are really pathetic. :) I decided to look at a review that I haven't looked at in 2 years and all I can say is Wow . I will say this though.... Since I wrote the review ( which I still stand behind 100% ) I saw him twice at shows he was at this past summer and he was as awful live as the singing on the CD. I see that their are some people that agree with me ( I guess these are the people that listened to the CD ) like I said, I love Cinderella but after seeing him this summer I know its a ship that has sailed and sunk !!! He just cant Pull it off anymore.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|This is Susan's best so far but everything she has done in my opinion is stunning. I became a fan way back in 2009 when Susan first hit the world stage. \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\" is my favorite if I had to choose one from this 4th album. She dreamed a dream and I am happy I can share in that dream. I listen to her daily and look forward to album 5,6,7 and forever. This star is shinning bright especially in \\"Standing Ovation\\".I met a friend through Susan's music and found we shared so much we became sisters in spirit and we live 3,000 mile apart and share the same name but her name is mine but backward.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|This book kept my attention the whole way through. I had trouble putting it down, then looked forward to my next opportunity to continue reading.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's big, it shows your input as you type it in , what more do you need?  Best calculator app for Kindle Fire
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is an entertaining movie that  holds to high standards of moral behavior.  It models how to love our neighbors as well as the need to  have the words of music encouraging high moral standards as well,  Extremely well done!!!<br /><br /> How did such a rare treasure  ever come forth at this time when so many movies have such low standards of stories and music.<br />Human weaknesses and shortcomings are a definite part of the work, but the way they are handled is what is so superior.  The characters themselves teach by example. No one is perfect, but enough of the community strives after righteousness that the lessons for good prevail.  Every home would profit by these movies.  Well cast, appealing to watch.  We are fortunate to have this treasure.The world needs this.  Interesting because Americans increase theeir understanding of English culture of the perlod.
B009GX7IRA|4.0|Exciting episode, the ending was so climatic that you couldn't wait to see if Tony & Ziva survived.  One of the better episodes of the season.  Will continue to watch this well written and acted series.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|A great movie showing a cultural period we enjoyed learning about.  Such a generally good script.  Clean up several scenes and<br />remove the out of character slips Lord Grantin did with the maid and you would have a jewel.<br />Why are the directors so afraid they will loose their audience if they don't go over the line with  more information and graphics<br />than people need  to make a point.  Some kinds of sensationalism arent appropriate.  The audience would grow were these few offensive scenes eliminatred.  You turned a great movie into a soap opera.
B009A87X80|1.0|I LOVE LOVE LOVE EVA CASSIDY..  BUT the sound quality of this CD was beyond disappointing.. \\"Songbird\\" has so much background static..  The ENTIRE CD lacks richness of sound (mainly the instruments, but at times her voice too).  I get better sound quality listening to her on YouTube...And YES I tried it on several different players...  I was so looking forward to this CD. VERY POOR QUALITY OVERALL.. Completely bummed! the only reason it gets any stars is because it is EVA. Dont waste your $$ on this one.
B009RH9FR6|3.0|Overall, great product! This is my second Kindle Fire HD case. I had the Fintie Slim Fit case before but decided to get a new one because there were some things about the other I was not really a fan of. ANYWAY! My one problem is that the \\"soft magnets\\" in this case's cover that are intended to put the Kindle to sleep weren't quite strong enough to do that. What I had to do was dig the magnet out of my old case and slide it into the new case to make it strong enough to put the Kindle to sleep. THat bummed me out because my old case was going to be that backup in case something happened to this one, but I guess now it is spare parts. Unfortunately that is a big deal because in the long run it will do a number on your battery. Obviously you can still push the sleep button on the top of the kindle to put it to sleep, but if I buy a case that is supposed to be able to do that for me I don't wanna press the button. Other than that little hitch I love my new cover. I love it's ability to rotate. The leather is comfortable. I love the hand strap. Some people complained about the Kindle flapping around when the hand strap is on, but all you have to do is use the elastic strap that holds the cover shut (It even shows that in the picture) and the Kindle doesn't flap. But yeah three stars because the magnets weren't quite strong enough...
B005KJJ4F8|5.0|That was so awesome I loved the action it was a awesome book everyone should read that book it is so cool
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As usual, very entertaining, concise, and creative.  Grisham is such a good story-teller!  I couldn't put this book down.  The ending doesn't drag on either... suspenseful till the end.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|These stories are so great.  I had so much fun reading them and now I am reading them to my daughter and she loves them so very much.  They are filled with excitement and intrigue.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Absolutely loving the series.  I only am watching it on my iPad when I am running on treadmill..makes the time go by quickly
B0042TV4IW|5.0|A step into the past in a small town with all the drama and joy that comes in a loving but normally challenged family.
B003MC5N28|4.0|I think that it's an interesting book, and the thematic is good. Actually I like this kind of books because it trying to let you thinking. You could get and interesting opportunity to enjoy.
B009H5IS1W|5.0|Love it! Like a great book I just can look away! Writers with some messed up minds :)  Can't even say I have a favorite, I love all the characters.
B004LQEYAG|5.0|It is one of the great movies of all time, and appeals to almosst everyone whether you like action (not computerized), western, comedy, romance or musical (great soundtrack). It certainly is in my list of the top 20 movies of all time
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|One of the best books I've ever read. I wish there was more!<br />I guess I will just have to wait for the rest of the movies.
0374275637|5.0|This is a collection of several things that Kahneman has been writing about on his research papers.<br />It is great to have them all togheter!
B00007BKVC|5.0|Had be a long time since I watched this movie, but it's a classic and one that I never get tired of watching.<br /><br />Plus a hot, young Brad Pitt, definitely adds alot to the movie!
074322454X|5.0|Some WWII history books cover a particular battle or a particular individual.  This WWII history book follows a paratroop company, specifically, Easy Company, 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 101st Airborne Division, from their initial training in July 1942 to their first combat jump (on D-Day) and on through all of their subsequent battles until  the unit was inactivated in November 1945.  It is that focus on a group of individuals, forged under the rigors of training and tested by the stress of combat, that differentiates this book from many WWII history books.  Note: The HBO series was based on this book.
B0015RFCZ0|5.0|I really enjoyed this &#34;love story&#34;, love of two adults for each other, mother for son, son for music, son for parents he has not yet met.
0446585025|5.0|I love this book... Ellen DeGeneres is amazing.  This is a very easy to read, and I laughed out loud many many times.
B00B7PIRIE|5.0|I am enjoyng these very much only one regret that there is not closed captioning for my husband who is hard of hearing
B009KEN87O|5.0|This game is great. I spend almost an hour playing this. It's totally worth getting, and its free on top of that. Must have app.
B00BF11STU|1.0|I downloaded this movie to my Kindle and the movie didn't work.  I wasn't able to watch it, but paid for it.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|These build a town types of apps are really more like projects than games. This is a bright and cartoony game that kids and fans of the movie will enjoy. But unless you are willing to shell out a lot of money for the rare stuff, it will take a LOT of time to earn enough to get them. Patience most kids probably lack. Overall a good town -Sim game.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I have really enjoyed this game. But, now I am in stage two and stuck. The Help isn't enough for me to more forward. I believe I found what the clue is telling me, but my found item isn't working there. Though I am not done trying to figure it out. I hope I get further because I have really enjoyed it to this point.
B0094M2S5A|4.0|This was not my first time. It is a favorite movie. I liked the fact that they were all U of M alums.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This is a moving. keep you guessing type movie.  I really liked it a lot.  In fact Ben has never disappointed me in all the movies I have seen him in.  Keep it up please.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This is a wonderful show with a unique subject matter. The actors are very good although the lead sometimes overacts.<br />Really fun show.<br />Highly recommended if you like historical drama.<br /><br />Lots of sex and violence but not too much nudity.
B00CEK9OTM|5.0|Old time dexterity game fun with a modern twist, this game keeps you rolling with so many levels you will never run out of fun.  The graphics are great and the levels are challenging.  I can't put it down.
B009A9EPLM|5.0|i love it great movie i have the dvd now the cd i will let my friends listen to it
B0089LOKHG|5.0|These three books are great. I really loved them. The love story in them are wonderful. This is a must read for fans of love stories, some adventure, and sci-fi.
B00BKTFABE|4.0|Like this one improved over the past choices.great for iPad. Easy picture taking. Will like this one a lot.Do this one over others
B008GXHOFW|5.0|He is my favorite hero and I think you should try it out. I know when you get to the last level you will be upset.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This series is top-notch (witness the author getting deals for physical books, movie, etc.). At the start, I thought, &#34;Arrgh! Don't do that to me!&#34; But the author pulls into the future &#34;world&#34; of multiple silo bunkers. Why people have to live in them, how they keep alive, who &#34;watches over&#34; the system, and what the social fallout is makes for fascinating reading. You will enjoy the books in the Silo series more if you read this Omnibus edition, then First Shift, then Third Shift. Reading them out of order would &#34;give away&#34; too much information.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Page after page I just wanted more and more. Kept me on the edge of my until the very last page.
B0041T4ML4|4.0|Wow. Talk about dystopia. This is it! The author's prose rubs your face in the squalid conditions that we caused ourselves. Genetic manipulation gone wild. The outcast &#34;Windup Girl&#34; is the common thread throughout. Don't expect a Hollywood type ending, but do expect it to be as positive as practical in the imagined future earth. Corporate politics, some violence, and a lot of societal examination is mixed well.
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I honestly was very doubtful I was going to like this movie when I first heard about it. I now wish I would have seen it in the movie theater.
B007SYWFRM|1.0|After spending a decent amount of money (by choice) a whole bunch of animals (dinosaurs only, coincidence?) After I added Dino world. Now I have to repurchase again. Wrote company, they responded until I told them the issue, then I was ignored.
0062082353|5.0|I bought this book several months ago before Chris Kyle was murdered, and it was great read. I wish he was still alive to write more books and help the veterans the way he has over the past few years. rest in peace Mr. Kyle
B005723JSQ|4.0|Some parts were a bit too dragged out and it took the heroine a bit too long to realize what was really going on but the characters are so enjoyable and vivid. And as I do with most Kinsella books, there were some scenes that had me laughing to the point of tears (jewelry shop for one).<br /><br />Great book. Couldn't stop grinning towards the end. Finished it in 2 days. Highly recommend it.
B00B5P37IG|1.0|This app took over my Kindle Fire HD displaying religious shows. Even after closing the sound continued even while trying to run a different app. Couldn't believe this is even available to customers.
B008JFLWLE|5.0|Very simple function and easily mastered. Had a little trouble drawing pi but once I learned what it wanted it was easy to use
B001BANK32|5.0|Great and gritty. One of King's best works, makes you scared not only of unnatural forces but of humanity itself.
1594203334|5.0|It should be required reading of all new and existing mothers,,,,,,,,,especially the part about potty training and teaching them how to be contented
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|It's going to take a great deal more than a sleeve and two Oreos to get over this book. I have read it twice now in four days, and it was even greater the second time! I also cried twice. That is all.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|Pretty interesting. I like hitch. history of movies.. personality and character of industry and individuals,  fun to watch.<br />Actors were just primo... direction and production on a par.<br />Worth the rent for sure!
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Peculiar is one of those fine words that sounds just like it's meaning, and that is particularly helpful. Imagination is a word that most adults cannot grasp the concept of. Riggs held onto the concept of the imaginary and added to it the concept of history and education. MPHFPC is a perfect and precise mixture of these things. It is intriguing, and I find it wonderful.
B0040UAYI4|2.0|Tried it out on two TV's, a 1080p HD projection bought 10 years ago and a digital flat panel bought a couple of years back.  Played several game sessions, about 2 hours each, probably a total of about 8 hours.  Tweaked and tweaked the settings.  Some settings had to re-do once a new game started.  Biggest issue I had with it is not being able to scope a weapon.  Attempting to scope weapon would show the weapon repeatedly glitch back and forth from non-scoped to scoped.  Tweaking made the movement of the weapon not so bad at scoping but could never eliminate it.  Even tho the focus of the weapon was dead on when it was doing that rapid scope/unscope movement, it was too distracting, affected my ability to play.<br />Sent it back after a couple of weeks.  If I could scope my weapon without the glitch, would still be using it today.  Using the controller is still difficult for someone who has PC gamed for about 15 years with keyboard / mouse.  Old dog is still struggling to learn the controller trick.  Will probably stick to PC games for now and use PS3 for Netflix, Amazon Prime and Blue Ray.
0812550706|5.0|Wow, what an interesting story.<br /><br />The suspension of reality was very easy for this book.  Most good sci-fi books have a foundation in reality and this is one of them.<br /><br />My only gripe with the story is the PC game.  That was a big stretch and speculation was a load.
B00BD2DRHW|4.0|I would have given it a rating of 5 stars if it had worked on the Galaxy too, but it just crashed repeatedly.
0061900656|5.0|My soon to be 3 year old loves this book.  I think it covers all of the important aspects of bringing a new baby into your family but stays light and entertaining. I would highly recommend it for toddler aged children.
B006GECE9Y|5.0|The bookmarks are a thousand times better and the browsing seems quicker.  The history feature is better than the Android default browser too.
0525952926|5.0|For myriad reasons, books set during WWI are not on the top of my list, however, this book held my interest from the first sentence is the last. I  actually spent two marathon days reading this, because I could not put it down.  The characters--some from the Fall of Giants, others the children of characters in Fall of Giants, were well drawn and intriguing.  This book covered the period of WWII from some different than usual viewpoints.<br /><br />There is one downside of this book, and that is that book three is not due out until 2014!
B00AB7HESI|2.0|Our grandson (age 7) wanted this game and since it was only $.99 we said that was fine.  He went up a level or to a different level and we were charged $.99 for each of these.  The game is cute, hence the 2 stars, but just be sure you know what you're doing or you'll keep getting charged extra fees each time you do something.
0451232577|5.0|Ken Follett has done it again--he has made history captivating.  The history is spot on as far as I can tell.  The characters are well drawn and three dimensional. Once you start reading, you don't want to put it down.
B003KGBISY|4.0|The packaging that this classic Kurasawa film comes in really puts a nice touch on this movie.  I like the effort that the Criterion company went to in providing a bit of a nicer touch than your standard dvd case.  It really makes this more of a collector's item.  Yes the packaging ultimately goes into the closet with the other boxes once the movie is loaded into the blu-ray carousel.  However, flipping through it upon initial viewing provided a nice introduction to the film before viewing it.
B001VIMCW4|3.0|I like James Bond and if your reading this you may also like him or know someone who does.  Craig was a fine Bond, but the script and story was not easy to follow for younger viewers or someone getting-up and down for popcorn.  If your a Bond fan, add it to your list of &#34;Yes, I saw that one too.&#34;  If your introducing Bond to a younger and new viewer, keep looking.
B00A0MJ9ZA|4.0|Anytime you can find a Disney movie combo pack for your kids buy it. This movie provides a blu-ray disk for at home, a DVD for a laptop or friend's house, and a digital copy for the road. Combining all these formats allows for maxmum viewing options based on a family's rapidly changing schedule. I recommend anyone grab a Disney movie while it's out of the vault. It might be a decade or two before you get another chance. Yes it's a marketing ploy, but it works. That's why Disney continues to do it.<br /><br />As for this movie our kids love the storyline of Peter, Hook, and, for whatever reason, the crocodile.  The timeless story is worth getting for your own Kindergarten/Elementary aged children.
B003YHSE7W|5.0|I thought it was a great movie, huge Iron Man fan. Recommend to others they will love it  I am sure
B002RL7W9W|4.0|We bought this as a gift.  It got a great reaction from the little boy we gave it to.  So I guess that's a good product endorsement.
B0086700CM|5.0|Bought this for the kindle and my kiddos ages 8 and 5 have been entertained by Temple Run on many occasions.
B0061QD7YS|4.0|Anytime you can find a Disney movie combo pack for your kids buy it.

It might be a decade or two before you get another chance.  Yes it's a marketing ploy, but it works.  That's why Disney continues to do it.<br /><br />As for this movie our oldest can't get enough of it.  If there's one movie that he'll watch over and over it's this one.  He's 5 now.  So I'm glad to let him watch it whenever we get on the road for those long car trips.  Our youngest is more of a Thomas fan, but he's coming around to the Disney addiction.
B007RCJNDE|4.0|The book was OK, a little too battle-centric with variety provided by flicking from one battle front to another.  So it is relatively dull compared to the colour and movement of earlier volumes.  Unfortunately, I don't understand the bit about Rand's pipe lighting at the very end nor the people who appeared to fight and die one day and then return the following day ... but apart from that a lot of loose ends were suitably tied up.<br /><br />It probably lends itself to another small epilogue volume a bit like the prequel volume, New Spring,<br /><br />I found the suggestion that a couple of minor characters were gay, a little unconnected to the Jordan originals - not that it was gross - just out of keeping with the earlier style.<br /><br />Oh, but the discovery of anti-balefire was most implausible.
B004UA8D1O|5.0|I have no complaints about this purchase at all. I love the movie and it came flawless and I didn't have to wait long!
B0006J28L4|5.0|The item arrived on time and it was in great shape. I really enjoy dealing with you and I will continue buying from you and recommend you to my friends. Thanks!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|As I have only just begun to read this author I was pleasantly surprised by the depth of character development and the wonderfully descriptive narrative.  The story is well constructed and leads to a climax that only makes you rush into the next book to see where the characters are heading.
B000NVL1XQ|5.0|The item arrived on time and it was in great shape. I really enjoy dealing with you and I will continue buying from you and recommend you to my friends. Thanks!
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|I bought this app a couple months ago, and I love it! You can write whatever you want and keep track of things easily. And there are different awesome notebook covers too! You can even set a password on it so you know that it is protected.
B005PSG4JS|5.0|The item arrived on time and it was in great shape. I really enjoy dealing with you and I will continue buying from you and recommend you to my friends. Thanks!
B008N1V11U|5.0|the dark knight rises is a great game and is worth every penny. the game is fun and it is just like a city. sry for spelling it keeps autocorreting
B000FA5SMK|4.0|This book grab my attention while I was trying to decide what to read next. I would recommend this book for people who like to read suspense.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|Incredible story with a great sound track.  Even the &#34;Making of the Movie&#34; is a good story.  This is a nice movie to own and share with friends.
B0068MNO4S|5.0|... \\" I have made my life's work : to know the the character of mankind ...you may have betrayed me but you will never betray my words \\" ... says Edward de Vere ... thru this  grandiose tour de force set by R. Emmerich ... in such a splendid art direction & fully detailed recreation of this TUDOR period film ... indeed not easely simple to follow but thanks to digital recording one can rewind as many times to repeat & enjoy its full content ...  a superb film that displays many aspects of mankind's journey since middle ages to nowadays human ambitions ... for example was intriguung  to learn that people from royal status were not able publishlish and actually were force to seek a \\" messanger \\" ... an amazing cast under a great point of view of this somewhat block-buster oriented movie director .
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was a really sweet story, good romance. I would recommend it to someone that is looking for a good light read.
0064400557|5.0|She reads books like these because they are interesting to her. The service and condition was great. Thank you for another good experience
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Thiz game helps me with my speed and my agility.it also helps me wit my reflexes and reactions. thankyou to who Eva made this game
B004SBQGHS|5.0|My grandson is four and loves it. it is a good electronic game for my him, he enjoys playing it and will not put it down
B00B8WXG9G|5.0|I have always loved the artist and his music so what can I say.  This product has surpassed all expectations and I love it
B00003CXBK|5.0|A good the message it gives. I enjoy very much Miyazaki films. This movie gives you a sense of respect for all.
B0094K1JPC|4.0|A chick flick with a twist that makes it fun for everyone.  My honey and I watched it to fill some time and it was fun.
B001GMQALY|5.0|Hollywood classic FOREVER! It will turn you on in the most stylish way possible! Too bad Rourke completely use up his nocking look.
B0044CE682|3.0|Much of what happens in season 3 was really interesting and enthralling.  I watched the final episodes in a marathon streak.  And then the last episode was super disappointing.  It wasn't even good.
B004SRPXWQ|5.0|We all laugh when Tom Cat repeats what we say to  him!  Giggles from grandchildren each time  we play.  I love it!
B00CHI5B7A|4.0|It had everything I was looking for in a movie: action, suspense and more action.  Plus the bad guys lose.  I remember a lot of suspense for me was around whether Cohen would discover the undercover cops.  And I guess the drama could have been better when bad things happened.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|the long and winding road finally comes to an end. Thanks to Robert for a grand story,and to Brandon for finishing it.<br />An epic series indeed.
B000002MG1|5.0|AUTOMATIC FOR THE PEOPLE has to be one of the greatest albums of the 90s. I love this album the songwriting is beautiful, mature, emotional, dramatic, its everything an album should be. While the content of the music is more acoustic guitar driven and has that sad feeling throughout the album it also has that positive messege and thats what i love about REM and this album. Everyone knows this album is on many lists and a mark in rock history and once you listen to this album you'll understand why. GREATEST OF ALL TIME!
B000002O4X|5.0|Again, these are great melodies, that have hauntingly beautiful appeal.<br />So romantic and I can picture myself reliving each scene, but now, I get to<br />hear the whole tune.
B002ZOHVN8|3.0|Editors has to be one of my favorite bands today, they are very unique and great songwriters. I remember randomly buying their first album and instantly falling in love with the sound. On their third cd they almost completely got rid of the guitars and attempt to make a synth album. To me the band at times sounds very DEPECHE MODE and i dig the sound at times the songs sound tiring and you also get tired of them. They are some great songs on here \\"YOU DONT KNOW LOVE\\" , \\"RAW MEAT\\" \\"RACING RATS\\" AND \\"THE BOXER\\" are the best tracks on this cd. If your expecting the sound of their self titled then dont buy if your expecting their sophomore album check it out its just not as good. Hope their next album is better, way better.
B004J4WNL2|4.0|Found this to be a thoughtful read in understanding yourself as well as others. Also, terrific for any extravert parent with a clearly introverted child.
B000002LOE|3.0|OUT OF TIME to me is their weakest album I dont understand why it was so praised or such a big success other then of course \\"loosing my religion\\" being the biggest song of the 90s. Some songs have a very country sound to them which is not a bad thing and michael stipe has an amazing voice just like in all of his work, but to me this album was the weakest. SHINY HAPPY PEOPLE has to be one of the worst songs they've written and so annoying along with a couple of just random boring instrumental songs and that is why i give this album 3 stars if i could i'd give it 2 1/2.
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Always lots of action. Between the acting and the story plot you'll be drawn right in.  If you only watch one episode per sitting i'll be shocked.
B000002UVZ|5.0|I LOVE THIS RECORD IT IS GREAT ROCK RECORD AND HAS THE SAME SIMILAR SOUND TO ITS PREVIOUS ALBUMS. I RECOMMEND THIS IF YOU HAVE \\"MURMUR\\" AND \\"RECKONING\\" YOU HAVE TO OWN THIS AND YOU WONT BE DISSAPOINTED. REM AT THEIR BEST
0385349831|4.0|a wonderful novel of faith and belief during the most difficult times the book shows us that a simple thing can give us hope
B000EDWL82|5.0|I remember buying this album at random at a local record store. And the results when i heard it was \\"what is this\\" and was in my player for months, i couldnt get enough of this album and still can't really it has to be one of my favorite cds to come out in the past decade. Sure alot of people say ever since INTERPOL, BRAVERY, FRANZ FERDINAND, KILLERS, ETC came out you had all these other bands follow that sound, sure that is true, but the editors sound like a band that listens to alot of ECHO AND BUNNYMEN and REM and record some music instead of listening to JOY DIVISION. In my opinion this band sounds more like ECHO AND BUNNYMEN,REM,CHAMELEONS then JOY DIVISION. Highly recommend this you won't be dissapointed.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|Without reservation, the best book on corporate IT ever written. And a strong contender for the best business novel ever written. In the style of Eli Goldratt and Patrick Lencioni, this book clearly lays out the story of how corporate IT works today, with all its incredible dysfunction and farcical comedic incompetence. As the story progresses, we see the Parts Unlimited organization transformed using modern management and operations methods like Lean, DevOps, Kanban, and continuous deployment.<br /><br />It is both a scathing critique if the status quo in corporate IT, and an inspiring message of hope for what is possible. I cannot recommend it highly enough, and I plan to buy and give away many copies of this book.
B000002MU3|5.0|WHATS THE FREQUENCY KENNETH? who knows what that means but it is one of the catchiest songs by rem. On MONSTER rem takes a look back almost but with a 90s alternative/indie/rock and even some grungier guitars. Monster is very strange and unique in its own sound that you cant hate this album. A very enjoyable listen.
B00CBKXGPI|2.0|I only gave it 2 because within mins of playing you have to buy it and when you change cities it would force close but when you went back into the game you were in the city you flew to. Either way uninstalled and NO way I'm buying. Save your money. Samsung galaxy note 10.1
B00C5ZORES|5.0|I don't normally write reviews for albums, but I've been listening to this one for the past few days and I really like it! You can tell the band put a lot of themselves into the music and lyrics. I highly recommend it for fans of FOB - new and old.
B009O07NDY|5.0|There are so many classic songs on here, I don't know how to begin rating it!  My 14-year-old, 10-year-old, 9-year-old, 7-year-old and 4-year-old nieces and nephews love it ... ask to listen to it, and sing along with Thorin, the Dwarves and Neil Finn.  Buy it today!
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|I love having this handy as I love word games!!!:) It comes in handy and very helpful!!! I has many uses and is easy to use which make that much better!!
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Yes, I love the Hobbit (the book).  I saw the Hobbit in the theater 14 times (at least 1/2 were paid for by others).  I love Richard Armitage in North & South & MI-5.  I love Martin Freeman in Sherlock & the UK Office.  What's not to love about this movie?
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Eash movie is better than the previous one.  I can't tell you how many times I have watched all of these moview.  I will continue to watch them over and over!!!!!
B001E9641K|5.0|This gave is worth it if you like the US (or any other version) of Ticket to Ride.  It's worth the money.
B0055PGUYU|5.0|Excellent informative book, well written, full of good insight.  A bit wordy but needs to be to make the case.  I would suggest this book to anyone that wants to understand the nature of human individuals and groups and how habits evolve and how to change them.  The graphical illustrations need to be improved and increased - my only critical comment.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've tried many keyboards and SwiftKey is by far my favorite. I'd like additional themes or custom kins but that is very minor. 5 stars!
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|A great family-friendly movie that everyone (especially gamers) will enjoy time and time again. The 2 disc is worth the little extra, especially considering that one day DVD players will be as obsolete as VCR's and you'll want that blu-ray disc when the time comes. It makes sense to invest in the two-disc combo packs at this time so there isn't a need to upgrade later like there was with the incoming of the DVD player.
B00B2QG3K2|5.0|I'm not gonna lie; when I started listened to this CD all the way through, I was thinking, \\"Huh. It's not bad, but it's not particularly good either.\\" This was my feeling for the first three songs. They just didn't do it for me.<br /><br />That being said, WOW was I surprised when I found myself absolutely adoring every single other song on this album!!! From the free, catchy, fun strumming of \\"Moving On\\", to the furious energy on \\"Anklebiters\\", to the sexy hooks and symphonic features of \\"Crazy Girls\\", to the epic, crescendoing conclusion that is built-up in \\"Future\\", this album is a non-stop musical gem that I'm definitely going to want to sing along to in my car like an awkward lunatic.<br /><br />Well done, Paramore. You have truly impressed and enchanted what was once a casual listener and is now a devout follower. I wish you good luck and good times in all of your shows on tour. :)))
B005DOJ68K|5.0|Feel good, get going, wholesome rock/country banging fun. From the first time I heard them, I was hooked-40+ years ago!
B006IYG5HE|5.0|If you like Stieg Larsson's series and, like me, you've gotten into Northern European writers because of him you won't be disappointed in this novel or this author.<br /><br />Alternating the story between WWII and today, the author tells the story of a possible killer on the loose that could have major repercussions to Norway. Extremely interesting, keeps you guessing until the end. Great plot twists and amazing writing. Takes a little to get into it but once the two stories connect you can't put it down and don't discover what is really going on until the last pages. Highly highly highly recommend it!
B0033VUH6A|4.0|Well made movie. I enjoyed it but not quite five stars. Worth watching if you like war movies. No regrets.
B009NG1Q96|5.0|This book was so good! I couldn't put it down. A great second great book in the series. Can't wait to read the third one and see where the story goes!
B009R659L8|4.0|I always look forward to the new MHC book.  This was another good one.  My only issue with it was that it seemed to have too many &#34;main&#34; characters, each of them becoming involved with one another.  I don't see that happening in real life New York, especially when their interactions seemed to be fleeting and shallow.  But, I don't have much experience with New York, so what do I know.
B00280LYIC|4.0|The book has very good detail of is like you are there. I would recommend this book to everyone. Even small kids.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|This is a great version of Mahjong.  I've played many and I absolutely love this one.  I use it on my kindle
B00B2V66VS|3.0|so EVERY time I go on temple run i do the tutorial i go to the settings and turn it off but then it wont let me go back so i have to go home other than that GREAT GAME
B00005KAQP|5.0|One of Whoopi Goldbergs best movies. I thoroughly enjoyed it again. For me this is a classic. Highly recommend it.
B005HSG3VK|5.0|The quality and price was excellent since I am on a fixed income .I have a cousin that bought a more expensive one he thought this one good
B005IQ39AY|5.0|I really like this game. I have almost become addicted to it (in a good way). I would definitely recommend it.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|For a free app, this one's quite enjoyable. I personally prefer the &#34;mineral&#34; mode of the game, which requires you to &#34;dig&#34; to deeper levels -- that get more and more challenging, the farther you go.<br /><br />Bottom Line: Highly recommended. The ads are unobtrusive, and gameplay doesn't get crazy-difficult until much later levels. And it's free, so you can't beat the price!
B001CDZZI6|2.0|This book promised a lot but did not deliever. The actual read is very short and the rest of the book is just all kinds of description for different strengths, most not related to your strengths. This product is more a test to get to know your strength, than it is a book. Not very useful.
B001R4MEYI|4.0|I kept hearing these guys pop up on Pandora and I kept thinking how awesome they sound so I bought this album.  Definitely have been enjoying it the 30 or so full listens so far.<br /><br />There are some really bad ass riffs sprinkled through out the album. The only thing I don't like is that it is only seven tracks, it feels short.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Plus :  Great writing.  I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />Minus - Horrible subject matter.  I wish I had been able to put it down.
B00985E3UG|5.0|Another case where reality surpasses fiction, depicting how food companies target their customers using science to make food addictive. The book is like a page-turner thriller where the victims are all of us.
0802473156|2.0|repeats itself in the content.  not helpful.  overrated by Oprah.  the test at the back of the book was OK.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|The alarm is more than adequate for me. The first time I used it, it woke me out of a deep sleep. It was really odd because I was dreaming about having to hurry for an appointment.  Out of nowhere, the sound of Big Ben chiming went off. I immediately woke up and found it was the alarm!  :-)<br /><br />I would definitely recommend it for anyone..
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This was a very good game. Enthralling until the last second. Big Fish has done it again. cannot wait to play the sequel.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|Loved the artist as he shines with his vocals and being unique on American Idol. He also has a beautiful personality.
B008XG1X18|4.0|PINTEREST GIVES YOU A BROAD WAY TO FIND DIFFERENT THINGS TO MAKE, THINGS TO DO, WORDS FOR THOUGHT, HEALTH AND BEAUTY TIPS, LIFESTYLE AND INSPIRATIONAL TOPICS TOO.<br />I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A BUTTON TO CLICK ON THATS SAYS..&#34;TRIED THIS&#34; OR &#34;DONE&#34; AND IT  WOULD STAMP ACROSS THE MAIN PICTURE TO SHOW THINGS THAT I HAVE ACTUALLY TRIED.
B000FA675C|5.0|Loved the first page till the end. It opened my eyes to so much I never know but still felt all is possible. Recommend everybody to read.
1878424319|5.0|Transformational reading for anyone who would like to better their life.  I have learned a lot about myself and how to make my life better.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|Worth it! Great acting and enjoyable story! I would highly recommend this given how much we enjoyed watching it! Enjoy!
B006ZDS7CE|5.0|Seriously. Buy this album and listen to it. You probably won't be too disappointed. I only bought it because I have way too much Amazon gift card credit, but it's just about all I've been listening to the past week.
B00C1BU7V8|5.0|Fascinating story telling.  It told of how the Historical event came to pass, and while showing the personalities, motives and difficulties of the men who were invovled.
B002722R64|5.0|Good action, story and believable characters.<br />Its one of the Bond movies that will go down as a classic.<br />It is what you expect a Bond to be and the rest is history.
B001F6ZIXW|3.0|Only in a few episodes.  The story line is developing slowly and the acting is poor.  I will give it a fair shot though and stick it out for a few more episodes.
0817439390|5.0|There are at least 6 ways to achieve the correct exposure, but the effect of the picture determines when to hunt for a specific setting.  This book teaches the reader when to use certain apertures and shutter speeds.
B004CFBMRY|5.0|As a novice runner, I was advised to read this book before going any further. my friend was right- it totally alters your attitude to running, makes you think about how you run, and why you run. A good read, the story is told well, interest is kept up, the facts are well researched, and the conclusions logical.<br />Throughly recommend.
0553801473|3.0|I have enjoyed the series but this book was long and did not answer questions. It is 1000 pages of dull and maybe 20 pages of something worth reading. The best part of this book was the end.
B009AMANBA|5.0|Again, Spielberg turns out a masterpiece. The music, which of whom I personally know, adds the authentic music of the era of which the film depicts. That music is still played today in Appalachia, much as it was in the 1860's.
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|Wow. I have been a Trent Reznor fan since my youth, and I was sad to hear that the recent &#34;wave goodbye&#34; tour was the final one for Nine Inch Nails. When I heard he was married to the Asian Madonna, I was certain his creative career was over. Thankfully, this was not the case Mr. & Mrs. Reznor have started a band with Atticus Ross & Rob Sheridan. The result is incredible, an atmospheric sound complimented by Mariqueen's hauntingly beautiful voice and Sheridan's kaleidoscopoic live show. Highly recommended.
B001AQQR2S|5.0|I love this movie. My children love movie. I love the way it shows that good can triumph evil. What I don't like about this movie is it portray girls can get buy on their looks and does not have to be intelligent. It is a funny movie and I give it a five star two thumbs up.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Diana continues with gusto and wonderful &#34;heart clutching moments&#34; to boot. I have Never Ever been able to put her books down easily. That's how real they are.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Charlie is an emotional, mature 15-year-old going through his first year of high school. In this book, he take us through all of his hardships that a lot of us have probably gone through at one point or another. I thought the book was a quick read and enjoyed it.
B000SEGUDE|4.0|while it took a while to get into the book I found myself really enjoying it. Similar in some ways to Time's arrow by Amis, though not as clever, it weaves interesting stories. I though the character development could be stronger for the mariner character.
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Excellent wide angle view of women's options, cultural and psychological limitations, and history of women leaders at top levels of US companies and corporations. Full of honest personal examples, and well documented research.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book was the 2nd best book of them all because the other book( book 1) was a littleless dark
B00B4804KS|5.0|This review is for the 3D version.  I am a big fan of the 3D format and after seeing some of my other favorite movies brought into the third dimension, I couldn't wait to see Jurassic Park and all of its dinosaur-attacking fury!  The image (on my 55&#34; LG) is crisp and clear and all the scenes I expected to be awesome in 3D totally were.  The surround sound is great as well.  As far as the movie itself goes, sure some of the science is outdated, and yes, it's kind of cheesy in places, but hey, that's what makes it great.  If you're a fan of 3D and giant man-eating dinosaurs, I highly recommend this new version!
B009JZTOG8|4.0|Unlike season 1, the season 2 split that happens because of winter hiatus also causes a split in storyline. the first half of S2 focuses a lot on the &#34;heroes&#34; of the story, their new found family dynamic, their past, etc. The second half focuses a little too much on the villains. As interesting and fun as they and their episodes are, there is also a lot of drama and upset happening with our heroes, and we barely get to see them. It's an odd balance this show has to make, and those episodes were necessary as well as great, but the price is that they ignore primarily Emma for about 4 episodes.<br />The main character additions were Captain Hook and Cora (Queen of Hearts). Amazing characters and interesting storylines that follow in their wake. Rumplestiltskin and Queen Regina get more evil as we see more flashbacks, but they also get more sympathetic. There were about two dud episodes that very few of the fans enjoyed, but they're made up for with the other phenomenal ones.<br />Overall, an amazing season, though for those of us watching it now rather than later on DVD, it's a little awkward to follow because the second half of S2 is constantly cut up by hiatus's (football, march madness, movie awards, and other Sunday things that a tv show can't compete with).
B009ZFPQOQ|5.0|Best little program. Not the most accurate but it has come a long way. Just need more people to help out.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Have bought all three seasons and have them on my Kindle.  Every time I watch the series, I pick up some new detail I had not noticed previously.  Am impatiently waiting for January 16, 2014, when Season Four premiers
B00BVYLBP2|4.0|Promising new series based on intriguing plot. Look alikes discover they are clones and they are being hunted and picked off one by one. Great characters well played!
B00AI5AQPQ|5.0|I read this book before passing it along to my 9 year old granddaughter expecting to just get through it.  To my delight, I read it straight through and enjoyed every page.  It was well written, fast paced, insightful, and intriguing all the way to the last page.  Any child from 5-50 would enjoy it.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|this book is AWESOME. it was very in depth with all of the character descriptions and progressions through the novel.
B002RI9X8S|5.0|When it was written this novel may have seemed polemical and political delineating as it does the horror of hopelessness in the face of forces both natural and human and demonstrating the dispassionate immorality of economics as a science. Today taken out of its historical context the story takes over carrying the reader into the valiant while still futile efforts of a family to remain in control of their destiny. As the family slowly disintegrates each member somehow manages to survive and grow attempting with insouciant courage to face and overcome the inevitable collapse of every single feature of their known world. Mama maintains her optimism despite the family being thwarted at every succeeding step of their odyssey. She emerges as a feminist prototype decades before feminism was a word let alone an ethic and in her fatuous daughter Rosasharn who is so continuously infuriating throughout the saga we finally see the epiphany of true humanism and compassion.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love it this is my favorite bingo ever , it is great!! It is so easy to play on the kindle and just an overall great game
B00BGIBVP8|2.0|unrealistic and vulgar. was embarrassed watchin it with my adult daughter. would not recommend it to any of my friends.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I found this game very interesting. I love hidden object games but when you add the adventure to it it becomes five times better. Its good to play a game that you can use your brains as well as yours eyes. After all thinking is good for you.
B00AQA94M4|4.0|The \\"Mystery Of Time\\" is the sixth studio album by Tobias Sammet's rock opera project. Avantasia offers a very good new album that rivals some of its past achievements. The use of a real orchestra proves to be a welcome addition, creating a bigger and more captivating sound.<br /><br />The cast of musicians includes Tobias Sammet (Edguy) on bass and lead vocals, Sascha Paeth (ex-Heaven's Gate) on guitars, Russell Gilbrook (Uriah Heep) on drums and guest guitarists Bruce Kulick (ex-Kiss, ex-Meat Loaf), Oliver Hartmann (ex-At Vance) and Arjen Anthony Lucassen (Ayreon). The Mystery Of Time is also the first Avantasia album to feature the German Film Orchestra Babelsberg.<br /><br />The list of guest vocalists is expectedly impressive and includes Joe Lynn Turner (ex-Rainbow, ex-Yngwie Malmsteen), Biff Byford (Saxon), Michael Kiske (ex-Helloween, Unisonic), Ronnie Atkins (Pretty Maids), Eric Martin (Mr. Big), Bob Catley (Magnum) and Cloudy Yang.<br /><br />The album offers a variety of hard rock, symphonic rock, power metal and pop-rock. The overall sound doesn't differ a lot from The Wicked Trilogy releases, but the orchestra surely makes things more interesting and the vocals are more evenly distributed.<br /><br />There are many highlights among the songs and only two of them sound rather weak or filler-like. There are several longer songs and even two ten-minute epics, but surprisingly none of them gets tiresome or boring.<br /><br />The best track is probably the longest song, entitled \\"Savior In The Clockwork\\". This is a varied track, with several tempo changes, but it is essentially a hard rock epic with some doses of power metal. The song is vocally dominated by Tobias Sammet and an impressive Biff Byford, with Joe Lynn Turner singing the first verse and Michael Kiske joining for some short passages towards the end. A strong chorus, several memorable guitar riffs and a good guitar solo, by Bruce Kulick, round off the track perfectly.<br /><br />\\"Where Clock Hands Freeze\\" is the mandatory Michael Kiske fronted power metal track and it is definitely one of the best songs on the album. Besides the short orchestral intro this is a fast and melodic double-bass driven song, with one of the best choruses on offer. Kiske probably delivers his best vocal performance ever on an Avantasia song. The track also features vocals by Sammet on the second verse, background orchestration and memorable guitar solos by both Sascha Paeth and Oliver Hartmann.<br /><br />\\"Black Orchid\\" is the darkest song and another highlight. A slower symphonic rock epic, featuring a successful duet between Sammet and Byford. Black orchid includes many orchestrations, a great chorus with big choirs and is probably the most atmospheric track on the album.<br /><br />\\"The Great Mystery\\" is the second longest track and the perfect album closer. A big ballad type of song, with several tempo changes, that combines influences from Magnum and the Trans-Siberian Orchestra. The vocals are shared between Bob Catley and Sammet, with small contributions from Turner and Byford. The song features a very memorable chorus and a well arranged and bombastic orchestral passage. A major theatrical highlight.<br /><br />\\"Dweller In A Dream\\" is a catchy up-tempo melodic hard rocker. It features a strong duet between Sammet and Kiske and another memorable chorus. Nothing mind blowing, but still very enjoyable and another stand out.<br /><br />\\"What's Left Of Me\\" is one of Avantasia's best ballads ever. A very nicely arranged track with strings, piano and choirs, which includes a very addictive chorus and is dominated by an emotional vocal performance by Eric Martin.<br /><br />\\"Spectres\\" does a good job as the album opener but ultimately fails to amaze. A mid-tempo rock song, with prominent orchestra backing and a good chorus. The orchestral intro is truly captivating and the vocals are dominated by Sammet, with a small contribution from Turner. The song looses points due to some strange arrangements.<br /><br />\\"Invoke The Machine\\" is the heaviest song on offer and features a rough and very fitting vocal performance by Ronnie Atkins. The track includes memorable guitar riffs and good solos by Paeth and Hartmann. Unfortunately the chorus is rather unimpressive and drags the whole tune down. It is still a good up-tempo melodic heavy metal song that many will enjoy.<br /><br />Besides the album's strong points there are also some flaws. The biggest flaw is the absence of longer and more technical guitar solos and the low mix of the guitars (in parts). Another disadvantage is the weak pop ballad \\"Sleepwalking\\", which ruins the flow of the album. The up-tempo hard rocker \\"The Watchmaker's Dream\\", is overall mediocre and another low point. The final minor flaw is the use of certain tempo changes, on some songs, that don't necessarily work for the best.<br /><br />In conclusion, The Mystery Of Time is a great rock opera release. It flows better than the previous three Avantasia albums and includes only two weak songs. Most guest vocalists do a great job and their roles are overall more prominent. The orchestra proves to be a very good addition to the sound and is used wisely. Personally I view the new installment as one of the stronger Avantasia albums, which surpasses both Angel Of Babylon and The Metal Opera part II.<br /><br />Tobias Sammet should be congratulated once again for this achievement. The Mystery Of Time is surely a contender for the album of the year.
B007SGM084|5.0|I've only made it to chapter 10 but my oh my. This author really does kino9w how to paint a picture!!!!!!!!!!!! It's a must read.
B0000UJDLM|4.0|old movie I've wanted to see.  Good for family movie night.  nine more words, three, two, one, zero, blast off
B005LCECU6|5.0|Was looking forward to hearing an old Rush performance for a concert I was not at - bonus! there are previously unpublished songs on here!  Well worth it for the serious Rush fan - didn't even care about the recording clearly reflecting it's AAD quality ... probably not for the casual Rush listener though ... rockin'!
044024157X|4.0|While The Last Juror is still part of the legal thriller genre, the main character is not a lawyer but the young owner of the Ford County Times, the local weekly newspaper in Clanton, MS.  In another departure from the legal thrillers of John Grisham, the story is a historical one, occurring during the ten years that J. Willie Traynor owned the newspaper, during the decade of the 1970s.  By using a fictional town as the setting for his story, Grisham cultivated characteristics of his stories that he extended to actual locations such as Chicago and New York in other novels.  The characters of Clanton are as real as if Baggy Suggs, Lucien Wilbanks, and Harry Rex Vonner were real people.  For all we know, they are based on people that Grisham knew when he was a lawyer.  Grisham used Ford County and Clanton as the setting of [[ASIN:0440245915 Time to Kill]], the sequel [[ASIN:0385537131 Sycamore Row]] and as part of the setting of [[ASIN:0385503822 The Summons]].    Wilbanks and Harry Rex were also introduced in 'A Time to Kill.'  Regular Grisham readers will also smile when Judge Ray Atlee is mentioned attending the housewarming party of Traynor at the renovated Hocutt mansion.  Atlee is introduced in `The Summons' and his two sons are the primary characters of that story.   Judge Atlee is one of the main characters of 'Sycamore Row.'     The main story of this novel is the murder of Rhoda Kassellaw, a single mother of two young children.  There is no doubt that Kassellaw was raped and killed by Danny Padgitt.  The defendant came from Padgitt Island, a remote island surrounded by the Brown River.  The desolation of the island provided the clannish Padgitts shelter to engage in criminal activity.  For example, the Padgitts were moonshiners during Prohibition and marijuana growers in the sixties.  Their expertise in illicit commerce made the Padgitts wealthy.  Getting a conviction in a trial of Danny Padgitt, backed by the resources of this well-connected family, was a formidable task.    Padgitt is a loathsome character, and his image is only exacerbated by the wealth and pull of his family.  He is a natural villain and a `usual suspect,' which Grisham used to create a diversion and surprising outcome in the third part of the novel.     The primary character, Willie Traynor, is a flawed hero.  He managed to get his work done even though he found it hard to wake before noon.  Traynor made wonderful strides in race relations by befriending the Ruffins and publicizing the remarkable achievements of their children in the local newspaper.  Traynor was an example of the New South.  The most visible symbol of the New South during the era was an energetic peanut farmer from Georgia who was elected governor in 1970.  That governor, James Earl Carter, was elected President of the United States in 1976.    Traynor promoted race relations in a subtle way by increasing the coverage of the high school football team.  People found it hard to get worked up over busing when one of its implications brought to the local high school a genuine football star who dominated headlines with his gridiron heroics. Granted, Traynor's motive was profit but think of all the major league baseball organizations that passed over talented black baseball players before 1946 because they would rather adhere to an unofficial color line than field a winning ball club.    Grisham mentioned that Traynor graduated from Syracuse University about ten times during the novel, but he could have attended any northern school that staged protests against the Vietnam War.  The Newhouse School is well-known for its graduates in journalism and communications, which fit neatly with Traynor's profession.      Grisham keeps the reader's interest by resurrecting a mystery from the first part of the novel (How did the jury vote?) with a new crime related to the trial of the first part of the novel.  While the reader can notice the limitations of John Grisham in the craft of writing, theyare overshadowed by his excellence at telling a story.  The best-selling author of the 1990s is also a top-seller in the 21st century because he has not lost his knack for storytelling.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|What a great read. From the 1st few pages I could not put this book down. There are many twists and turns that lead you to the surprise ending.
0385535147|4.0|Some people say `The Racketeer' is different from the other legal thriller novels of John Grisham because the main character is a black man.  Yet, the Racketeer is not about race and the novel has a number of tie-ins to his previous legal thrillers, especially `[[ASIN:0385497466 The Brethren]].'<br /><br />Malcolm Bannister serves his time as a jailhouse lawyer in the Frostburg Federal Prison Camp, much like the time served of the three judges in `The Brethren.'  Max Baldwin lives in Jacksonville for a while, also a location for `The Brethren.'  Money is wired to a Caribbean Island with tight banking secrecy policies, also a topic in `The Brethren.'<br /><br />The story behind the story is the unjust conviction of Malcolm Bannister, which is another common theme of several Grisham novels.  Even if one can make a case that Bannister was delinquent in his duties, the time did not fit the crime.  Bannister was swept up in the rush to convict anyone associated with his client, Barry the Backhander.  Even the nickname of this client is similar to another character in another Grisham novel.  That other character is Benny the Blackmailer, who made Kyle McAvoy an offer he could not refuse in `[[ASIN:0385517831 The Associate]].'<br /><br />The miscarriage of justice is a common theme of Grisham's novels, with `[[ASIN:0385528043 The Confession]]' being the most egregious example of a man tried and convicted for the wrong crime.  Readers of `[[ASIN:0385339666 The Chamber]]' may also feel that Sam Cayhall had been handed too harsh a penalty for his crime.  Both of those novels make a statement against the death penalty.  One of `The Brethren' also felt that they were maligned by overzealous prosecutors.<br /><br />The ingenious twist in the story is presaged, not only by an action of Bannister, but also by his feelings of disdain toward his FBI handlers.  We realized that Malcolm had other plans beyond his use of Rule 35 when he sent the letter.  Just to clarify, Rule 35 actually does exist.  Some of the drawbacks of reading John Grisham's novels are that he does not like to research details of his novels, and he will change the facts to tell a better story.  When Malcolm revealed his true feelings toward the FBI, this reader wondered whether or not he actually knew the killer of Judge Fawcett.  Was his scheme a bluff to earn a get out of jail free card?<br /><br />Even so, there was enough unfairness in the prosecution of Bannister that the reader feels his plan of revenge is justified.  The reader roots for his escape: from the thugs who seem to be pursuing him, to the feds who seem to tail him.  Bannister even manages to administer justice through his clever manipulation of the killer of the judge, the event that triggers all of the action in this story.<br /><br />Grisham abhors research and he is not very good at fitting actual locations into the story.  Those are not the reasons why you should read John Grisham.  Read him because he has a knack of knowing how to keep the reader invested in the story.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|this felt long. I'm not saying it's terrible but, I almost fell asleep reading this. I think the whole Javert chasing Viljean after he served his time thing was a bit ludacrous imo
0061906220|5.0|This was given as a gift, but I did read it before wrapping. It's a fun little story with a message to always remain positive. I love the James Dean stories, but &#34;Pete the Cat and His Four Groovy Buttons&#34; is by far my favorite. You won't regret having all his books in your child's collection.
B000JQU1VS|3.0|I don't mind mysteries but, as much as wanted to like Sherlock Holmes, I couldn't like it enough to give it higher than a 3. It's decent but it feels long.
B008ZOHCKE|3.0|just ok not happy or unhappy just not that great for what I wanted to us it for thats just me
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I would love to see more like it. Very addictive. Excellent graphics and story line. Couldn't put it down so I was depressed when it was over.
B0063IH60K|4.0|like it and it keeps you coming back the pop up ads are really annoying and dating ones are not age appropriate.
B00BHMETKC|3.0|This movie looks like a documentary movie with  twisted facts, I have no idea how it was nominated to so many prizes..<br />someone needs to investigate  Hollywood..
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|This is a great show considering it was done on the history channel and not History 2. It has a great story line.
1616550414|5.0|Let me tell you, this book is great. A godsend of any LoZ book to ever have. It has a massive amount of developer artwork, a big storyline of the legend of zelda (all the games) and each one to be individually described. I couldn't have asked for more!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|LOVED IT...KEPT ME GOING FROM BEGINNING TO END ..HARD TO PUT DOWN WHEN TIME TO SLEEP..LEFT YOU WANTING MORE AND MORE
0062059963|2.0|Let me start off by saying - I don't like America Singer. After reading The Selection and being thoroughly annoyed by the discrepancies in her character, I only came back to The Elite for Prince Maxon. This book though, is more like the show Bachelor than even the previous one. Only, they're both seeing other people. America is kissing Maxon in one scene, then promptly running into Aspen's arms the next. She's dancing and flirting with Aspen, only to end up in Maxon's arms the next minute. Then Maxon is kissing America, but having heavy make-out sessions with Celeste in the corridors (just coz it feels good) - not to forget he's also stringing Kriss along in case America doesn't work out. All of this was really off-putting.<br /><br />The only positive thing I can say about this book is that by the end, America has decided (FINALLY) that she's going to win her Prince and his trust back (better late than never). I was so afraid we'd have to be put through another five books of indecision before she can choose who she wants for real. I just hope she doesn't regress by the next book. In the next book, we can look forward to seeing Maxon scurrying between Kriss and America, unsure of who he wants to marry anymore (not a surprise after America's shenanigans in this one cause him to lose his trust in her). Yeah, bet you can't wait either.
B0088WFZQG|5.0|I highly recommend this movie! Doesn't come in over the top but will make you feel pride in our armed forces.
B00821PCJS|4.0|I love this show. Started watching on amazon prime after hearing about it on the radio. Couldn't stop watching until I got through all episodes. Only took me a week of watching in the evening. Really like getting to know the characters. Show has suspense, romance, and action.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|It does what it is supposed to do! Great for doing simple calculations. Just keep a widget and it's at your finger tips.
B008N1LL42|5.0|i thought it was highly entertaining, liam neisom was great, my favorite was beast john tui im waitng for battleship 2, very thrilling action, suspense film
B004WGIXX4|3.0|Some people hate it, some love it.  It's ok, it's actually interesting and entertaining.  I watched the whole thing.  It was kind of funny in parts.  It's not great like the old movies were, but compared to modern movies, it's ok.  \\"No strings attached\\", the euphemism, is all you really need to know.  Someone says \\"write a movie with this title\\", and there you have it.  Casual sex, but where does it lead?  I can't say anything else or I'll give away the whole movie.
B008133MDK|5.0|Awesome series; very pleased with product; was as described & on time. The modern Sherlock is classy and engaging. Love it!
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I think this is his best work yet. Love it. I have purchased all of his albums and videos. I love his songs and his personality.
B001AGNMIU|5.0|... one of the most provoking movies I have seen.  It opens your mind's eye to wander a bit... and the cloak wraps around you.
B008LC8TJI|5.0|Some of their best. I love Maroon 5 music and Adam Levine. His music rings real. I play it all the time together with his other albums.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|Great show, lots of action. Will invest in the whole series. I wish the show was not ending. Worth the buy

B00A9T1HUO|5.0|If you are a fan of Josh's wonderful voice, you will like the CD.  It's smooth, relaxing and a wonderful addition to his work.
B0073TZ1AA|1.0|If for some reason you need to have off files converted to speech it does an okay job.  Problem is I can read them faster.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Game is so much fun! I love it. It is very entertaining and can keep me occupied for hours. And it doesn't get old highly recommend!
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Addiction is the central topic of the movie, and that makes  it brutal to watch at times.  It is too realistic.  If you are renting a movie for some escapism, this isn't it.  But it is very well done.
B000JIHP88|1.0|I thought this was a really cute mobile and had to have it. Unfortunately it did not live up to my expectations. First off, it is a resource hog using 4-D batteries and 2 AA batteries which need replaced way too often. After using it for only 4 days without anything to obstruct the movements, the mobile stopped turning and would only play music. I returned it and the replacement only worked for a week before making an aweful squeaking sound as it rotated (crickets. Very loud obnoxious crickets.) I again returned it to toys r us. The 3rd one lasted a whopping 3 weeks before making the same squeaking sound. I am completely astonished at the poor craftsmanship coming from Fisher price these days, but this mobile takes the cake.
B005FFW46S|4.0|Snuff is simply a good Discworld-based novel. For people who already know Pratchett's style there won't be any surprises. Irony, puns and all other typical features are present (and I must say that the reading is enjoyable). However, I wouldn't recommend it for somebody who is not familiar with the series. There are too many references to earlier events and heroes to appreciate the plot without some background knowledge.
B0042J6VUS|3.0|Pros: its a tripod.....<br />Cons: super cheap and no moldings for volume buttons (meaning when you put it in the holder your phone zooms or powers off)<br /><br />I bought it for a cheap recording I did, to which it did decently. I had to put my phone in the other way than I wanted, which recorded my videos upside down. This wasnt a big deal as almost everyone knows how to flip a video, its just that the moldings that hold the phone take in no account for volume/power buttons (like samsung phones). I wouldnt buy again, but for $3 it wasnt too much of a loss.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|What a touching story! Garth Stein is a simple and great writer with a way To tell a story. I loved this tale.
B000PTYP7U|5.0|Thia is an awesome CD. I still have it. I bought it used and I love paramores songs. I will buy the next CD. I love the girl with the orange hair!
B000IZ8DZQ|4.0|Fun and entertaining period movie, with one of the best car chases ever. Makes ya just want to go driving in the Alps.
B0014C0BMU|5.0|This is a great movie, very emotional and lots of messages for life. Great understanding of sacrifice for humanity. Love it.
0316212377|4.0|I am a great fan of Iain Banks science fiction especially the \\"Culture\\" series.  The \\"Culture\\" is an advanced civilization where there are people but artificial intelligences are in charge.  His writing is clever in that snarky British style.  His intelligent space ships really steal the show.  I do agree with many of the other reviewers that Banks has gotten a little stale with this series.  This may be a hazard of being so good that less than perfection gets you marked down.  Nevertheless I really enjoyed this book and recommend it.
B004QYTRRS|5.0|I loved the story line and great actors, but It did have cussing.  I wish it didn't have the f word.
B005XT10YS|5.0|The Conspirator is a excellent movie to see. Everyone should see this movie. I've enjoyed this movie very, very much.
B008BQ8VOC|4.0|I love this show! The actors are good, the interactions are believable, the story-lines hold my interest. The 2 main guys are very attractive - one's a young Paul Newman knock-out!!  :)
0440237688|4.0|It took just over 2 weeks to receive this. I was pretty disappointed about that.<br />Still, the book itself was in pretty good condition.<br />The edges are slightly frayed, but nothing too terrible.<br />I wanted the book because I remember having liked it so much in middle school and wanted to read it again. Glad to add it to my bookshelf!
B00992CF6W|5.0|how the $:!&quot;&amp;# could you not give this a 5 star rating.  oh wait, by being a hater.  minecraft has to be the greatest game of all time.  I have the PC version but I know that this app is far superior to anything anyone else could possibly come up with.  so stop your hatin'.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Absolutly loved this book! Couldnt put it down! Fell in love with the characters and the story. It made me purchase all the books in the series! Cant wait for the next one! Bravo
B000002MTU|5.0|I am a huge Clapton fan, and this is without a doubt, one of his best complete works of nothin' but the blues!  Eric pulls no punches and gives his whole heart and soul in every song.  Great guitar work and great emotion in every song....this is a MUST OWN for any Clapton fan.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I  had a little trouble at first  getting it all set up,but once I did I was very pleased. I can change the<br />music  each  night if I want to. The wake up music or whatever  I choose, and  it doesn't'  scare you<br />on waking up
B007HACDLK|5.0|This is a flat out fun and engaging read!  Prepare to lose some sleep! Not that I expected anything less!
B0062NAVXA|5.0|This movie is great! Amazing story and a really great cast. I recommend this movie for families and not just families who are heavy into faith based practices as there are lessons to be learned from even the most petulant of people! Check it!

B008QE9XD2|4.0|This was a fun take on a classic show.  I watched the original series and loved the movies' approach.  My entire family loved it.
B005LAIHPE|3.0|this was played but it is not a true film as it would have been in the war as we say its okay but sorry no good
B005USZYDU|3.0|I found this book uneventful and predictable.  I appreciated how clean it was.  I would recommend it to a young adult.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This book definitely kept me guessing as it unraveled a mystery surrounding a woman's accident years ago which left her without a memory so that she was forced to start everyday anew like it was her first.  I liked the way it was written in the first person.  The only disappointing part of the book was the end which was simply tied up neatly in a bow.
B003B02O7I|5.0|The best reading I've done in a long time. A must read by everyone! Glad I chose to get it on my Kindle
B001AQO3QA|5.0|The presentation of these movies is beautiful! This is an easily displayable case that you'll brag about to your friends.<br /><br />The main thing I remember about this awesome series outside the movies themselves is a bit of history you may not be familiar with. You see, serious Sci-fi back when these movies were made almost NEVER had a Female lead that survived. This was the BEST of an extremely limited group. So, when Alien-3 killed off the Ripley character there was a some Big Time noise from the female side of the Sci-fi fan world. Resurrection, with the return of HER was almost demanded by the female fans. Of course the series was so popular, another movie made financial sense. But I would like to think that Alien-4 bringing back Ripley had, at least, a little to do with the need to bring a strong female lead back to the Sci-fi world.<br /><br />IMHO Alien-3 (despite the death of Ripley), was the worst of the bunch. It felt static, stuck on limited sets. Each character standing around waiting for their queue to speak again. It not only killed Ripley but attempted to kill the entire series with it. This followed two of the most awesome Sci-fi/Horror movies I've ever seen. It felt like the Writers/Director/Producers were done with the whole idea. AND they killed off Ripley to say \\"WE don't want to do any more of these movies\\".<br /><br />Alien-4 was for the fans. Better than 3 but not really that good. It brought Ripley back and attempted to blend the 1st movie with the 2nd. It failed. The monster really sucked. The blending of human DNA with Alien DNA ended up looking stupid, not scary at all.<br /><br />Alien and Aliens are kick-A awesome! Each are stand alone movies that complete their stories. Enough is told that a sequel is possible but not required.<br /><br />You would think that the way I feel about 3 & 4 would pull my rating down some. I thought about that but I must give this release 5-stars. Four movies were made and the complete collection must be owned. This Boxed 6-disc release is just too full of extras. Looks too nice as a display. Even if I hardly ever watch the last 2 movies, I'm glad to own this amazing tribute to the entire saga.wned. This Boxed 6-disc release is just too full of extras.

B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|this is basically just a hog.  go to a scene play the hog go to another scene play the hog.  no trying to figuring out where to go or what to do next.  boring.......there were some mini puzzles that were ok tho.
B005CAATXG|5.0|This Christian Rock band is amazing and I don't know why I waited so long to buy the cd because it is good. You can't find it in stores and got it for a good price.
B0050AV5MW|4.0|The first  3 books kept me in their grip for a whole month.... I could not stop reading and work was an irritating interruption.<br />The last book - A feast for crows - on the other hand ......Introducing long stories of until now unknown characters.. As if we did not have enough persons to keep track of already.<br />And the persons we already know as ruthless and cruel - suddenly tries to appeal to our good hearts.<br />I haven´t finished the book yet - I found my mind wandering - instead of being focused.<br />But the first 3 books - The best I have read in many, many years.
B000NY12LO|5.0|A story for today - I was not able to book the book down - As a mother I connected with both Alex and Lacey - This book is a must read
B008EKMB82|4.0|Like the story but wanted more in the ending which was somewhat disappointing or I would have given 5 stars.
1601251505|5.0|I'm not going to delve too much into the layout of the book.  However let me say as a graphic designer this book tops any work that I have ever done and I now look to pazio for inspiration on layout.  The book is THAT well done.  I am a scathing revewer on anything design related and I find my list of complaints about this book so overshadowed by its amazingly well organized nature that only one comes to mind.  I wish this book had a step by step guide to creating a PC.  Its not that its hard to do (I'm a hardcore veteran of 3.5) but for newer players I found that they had a few issues with this.<br /><br />However I recommend this book.  Actually you need this book if your a tabletop gamer.  I find pathfinder to be an excellent game for even players who normally scathe tabletop gaming.
0763644765|5.0|I got this book as part of my introduction to potty training with my two year old son. He is in love with this book! It talks about kitty using the litter box, and doggy going potty outside, and as a huge animal lover it really grabs his attention! There are not a lot of words in the book, which I like because i can fill in my own discription of the photos. It has really helped him with his training. When he has to go he runs to find the book, and then runs down the hall to the bathroom lol. I highly recommend it!
B007JMW46U|5.0|What a pleasant change after having just finished The Adventures of Arthur Conan Doyle!<br /><br />  I enjoyed all the stories in this book, and the illustrations were wonderful.  I didn't find any parts that I thought should have been omitted as I did when I read the biography of the author.  Although I had not read any Sherlock Holmes stories for many years, I enjoyed them all very much.<br /><br />  I did find the Kindle dictionary help a bit lacking.  Sometimes I didn't know what a word meant in the late 1800's in the British Isles.  However, when I requested that my Kindle dictionary help me with the word Bradshaw, I was told about a football player from the United States who was not alive when the book was written.<br /><br />  For the price, though, I cannot complain.
B004UJAOLM|5.0|Always loved this story but could never get the story straight. Read it again for the first in 35 years.......wow! What dark thoughts were in Emily Bronte's head!
B00AFG6HWO|4.0|This is a good album of electronica from the ex-Kraftwerk member. It's not groundbreaking or especially innovative, just good. Recommended.
B00AVXSOSG|5.0|Another classic I am reading as an adult and not a teen! Still not yet finished but I am enjoying the story.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|There have been thousands of near death experiences recorded but this is the first one by a neurosurgeon and skeptic. A doctor who regularly surgically invades brains developed a bacterial infection of the lining of his own brain and &#34;died&#34; for seven days.  Virtually flat lining, he made a miraculous recovery to return with the story of his experiences while &#34;dead&#34;. A wonderful hopeful experience.<br />I remember hearing that Steve Jobs last words as he was dying were &#34;Oh, Wow!&#34; He must have been seeing the same view as Doctor Alexander.
B00A7Z8KAU|4.0|It turns your tablet into a Wacom. You'll just need a stylus, as it is a bit too cumbersome drawing on a tablet with you fingers.
B000LTAY1U|5.0|I bought this watch for a friends birthday and she really liked it. I keeps perfect time and the green color was a nice switch from most of the common watches out there.
B0073TZ1AA|3.0|It does in fact read aloud off files. Though the monotone voice that was used gets a bit annoying to listen to after a few minutes.
B000SEKNUK|5.0|This guy epitomizes passion -- to inspire excellence and growth in OTHERS.  What an incredibly human being.  This book is Chicken Soup for Your Soul.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft is a very nice game on the computer. I thought I should give this one a try. It is very fun tags first but after a little while it got boring.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Nice easy to use and free. Would recommend in a heartbeat. What more could you want....Plus....<br /><br />GREAT BIG NUMBERS FOR OLE FOLK LIKE ME!
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I enjoyed this book. I love the connection between the main characters, but it is also deals with some very serious issues and is quite heart breaking.
B008V8FVTI|1.0|Not a movie worth viewing.  I felt it wasn't worth my time, in fact I didn't even finish it.  Should have rated zero.
0061733199|5.0|Covers a vast array of topics. Get a few copies and put one in your bug out bag, back pack, vehicle, whatever.  It's a good size for this and pretty durable.
B0028IDXDS|4.0|Unfortunately, our little guy doesn't really take a pacifier, but this would definitely help to keep it in/near his mouth if he did want the paci. I don't think I'd feel comfortable putting him to bed with this toy (early on, at least), but it's great for in the swing, car seat, etc.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|On many levels, this book struck a chord.  As a parent, and a lover of mysteries, I recommend it.  Great twists through out.
B00CKOYVG8|1.0|Can't review because it never showed up on my tablet.<br />Tried to re-order and got a \\"you already have this app message\\" :-(
B00153ZC8Q|5.0|This movie was a favorite from my past and re-watching it with my kids was fun.  The visual effects were pretty good for such an old movie.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this series because you become so attached to the characters that it's hard to let them go in this last book which by the way is amazing .
B000BNI99K|5.0|Great music sung by a great voice!  Love listening to this while cooking a nice dinner with family and friends!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|Slow start, but I was hooked before long. Can't wait to read Book 2 of the series. Matthew & Diana are wonderful characters that I want to keep reading about. I highly recommend this book to all readers of supernatural fiction.
B004W1GCNC|5.0|This series is the scandalous, grandson of Downton Abby! So well written and acted... love the grit and lead up to the second world war and how historically accurate it is!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|I find I am enjoying the Junior books about as much as the Ryan novels.  While Clancy has others helping him, the quality is still high enough that I look forward to each release.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I already have this movie as I bought it when it first came on DVD about 25 years ago.  It has been watched so often I bought the restored copy.  There is a big difference as all the colours are brighter and clearer.  This one will probably get worn out too.  It's the movie I reach for whenever I need a lift in my spirits.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|This has to be my favorite series ever.  Even all these years later I can watch the whole set and it brings back so many memories of my life at that age.  And it's still relevant to young people now.
B00B1OWEVC|5.0|This is music that evolves over time and sounds completely different depending on your mood. This is the opposite of pop music. With pop music, I dislike the song a bit more with each listen, as it plays out quickly and makes you feel the same way each time. With this album, however, I discover something new (a subtle nuance, a hidden emotion) with each successive play. It's almost as if this album was brilliantly formulated to get a little better with each listen! Although pop music is easy to appreciate, you don't get much out of it. Music such as this takes a little more work to appreciate, and you get more out of it in return :) Enjoy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I was a little skeptical when I started to watch this series. But once I did, I was hooked. The character development, pace, story, production etc. are all very nicely done. The best part is cheeky and understated humor. I also liked the way this series tries to connect audience with changing political and social trends of that time. One of my favorite shows of all time now!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I've been waiting a long time to find out how this series ends.  One of the best series I've read.  Love it!
B00BG08FKK|5.0|I loved Les Mis even before the movie came out but that is when I fell in love with Hugh Jackman. I think he did a phenomenal job as Jean Valjean. I listen to the sound track in the car. I almost know every word. I got the abreviated cd before the sound track came out so couldn't wait to get the dvd and movie sound track. I wish the cd was the entire sound track however.
0374533571|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this.. it was for a book club with some friends. We had a good time discussing it and plan to see the movie.
B007Y56JDQ|5.0|I like Richard Marx's music but really like this dvd because Hugh Jackman is one of his guests and he sings one of my favorite songs with Richard. (To Where You Are). I'm glad Hugh sings two songs with Richard but I wish To Where You Are was on the audio cd instead of She Wrote Me a Letter.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book made me want to not stop reading until i knew what happens at the end. Now i am eager to read the last book!
B002LBGBR2|4.0|Good album with great bonus tracks and features!  It arrived quickly and with everything it said it would, I really enjoy listening to it!
B0042UF4O6|5.0|As human as these wonderful characters are, they also exalt the higher morals that we would all do well to see more of on screen.  Loved it.<br /><br />If there are more programming like this, there would be less crime and fewer family breakups.<br /><br />Heart warming!
B0095P31L6|4.0|Thouroghly enjoyed the concept behind the movie even though the characters were animals. I recommend it for watching!! Good movie
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I found myself literally laughing out loud quite often. Tina fey is brilliant, I did not want the book to end.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is absolutely amazing!! Absolutely the best book series I have ever read. Ever. Highly HIGHLY recommend this to anyone and everyone. It offers something for every reader.<br />Amazing!
B004TI5N38|5.0|This is a great book--another baldacci winner. We need more John Pullers in real life. Everyone should read this book.
034580404X|5.0|These series is very provocative and intriguing, ones i started reading it I couldn't put it down, If you like erotic/romance i would recommend it
B006VFLIYK|5.0|It is sad that in the real world slavery exits today. Wish it could be dealt with like John Puller does in this novel. Especially the sex trade of children. Exciting read.
B002XXLKHY|5.0|Will Ferrell is hilarious in this movie. Great for kids and adults, you'll look forward to watching this movie every Christmas!
B008602KQI|5.0|riveting story and very interesting.  I find that books are way better than watching the movie....more details of thoughts and feelings
B001EN71CW|4.0|liked the set the only problem is there was no booklet with the episode guide included. if not for that, this would have gotten 5 stars.
B00CATSONE|5.0|Sean Patrick shares his extensive research and most importantly the motivation needed to find the pieces to the puzzles of whichever we choose to complete!!!!!!! EXCELLENT READ.....HIGHLY RECOMMEND
B00CHI5B7A|1.0|What a terrible movie. I had to forward it. Plain stupid. Hollywood will never be the same. The old was the best
B008KMHFJY|5.0|I can not, for the life of me, point this book down! Love it to pieces and can't wait to find out what happens but at the same time, don't want it to end! Enjoy!!
B008FYZIVY|5.0|After hearing all of the excitement about this series, i purchased it and did not get away from it until I watched EVERY episode in TWO DAYS! It is PHENOMENAL and I would recommend to anyone that likes &#34;period pieces.&#34; The costumes, furniture and period of this drama are so great and the story lines which follow NUMEROUS people is something I have never seen before. MY NEW FAVORITE SERIES! Can't wait for it to start up again!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have seen Les Mis 7 times, and now that I have my own copy, I can see it whenever I want. Amazon delivered it promptly and I'm always happy with Amazon.
0425263916|5.0|This is a great series! A must read if you enjoyed the 50 shades series! I cannot wait for the third book!
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|She really is happy to have received this from me on her 16th Birthday.  She and I always introduce other movies to each other and usually are thrilled.  Me more than she.
B007FH9GA6|5.0|This is one of the Best novel I have every read. If you love a story that holds you, you will love this trilogy.
0385349947|5.0|Every woman should read this and use it as their professional bible.  Even if you're not in the work force, you need this to help others who are.  Buy it as a gift and you will be remembered and can change lives for the better.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|I was in my 20s through the 80s, what a decade! Although not a big gamer, the movie, music and sci fi references really resonated with me. It is a fun read on one level but still manages to make a statement about where our world may be heading if we are not careful on another deeper one. I finished the book in 48 hours. Anything that can include def leppard 's \\"Pour Some Sugar on Me\\", Wilma Deering, and Monty Python 's Holy Trail and have it all make sense is nails in my book. I look forward to Mr. Cline's next offering. Wocka on, sir.
B004BSFC46|5.0|I saw a picture of my new niece with wrist rattles and thought, that's a good idea.  So I ordered these for a shower that I'm attending.  These are so soft and well made.  I'm going to arrange leaves inside the box with these little creatures on them.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|I recently got this game, and I have already finished it! It was so much fun, I played hours in a row untill I finished it! If you are a scribblenauts fan, You HAVE to get this game.
B008Z9YLV2|5.0|Love futuristic anything and it's scary to see that this could happen and hope it doesn't.  Mind blowing, great characters.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game!! It is so fun and I rate it 5 stars. I have no words because it's so great. I enjoy every day! I hope you all like it
B00005JMCN|5.0|I Love Seabiscuit--and, I love this movie, so was very glad shipping didn't take very long at all!--the DVD arrived in great shape, no problems at all--I honestly recommend both this movie and the book by Laura Hillenbrand on which the book is based--she is a wonderful author and the movie stayed pretty close to her biography of the Biscuit and his extended human family.
1421550644|5.0|really nice. so nice it made me come here and review something on amazon for the first time.  beautifully bound and quite large, everything you could want if you want a quality version of this amazing manga.
B00003CXCQ|5.0|Wonderful film, it has stood the test of time well and is very appealing to adults and kids alike,, I couldn't say that about the current crop of rubbish that Disney pumps out
B003ODIZL6|2.0|It really ducked and invite you to girl kisses but he gets used in the time that it wouldn't be there is a lot to do with the Skype's new book of it wouldn't be to know what I am how he talks with them<br /><br />Bakersylvia0@gmail
B0042L78MG|5.0|Bought this CD for my girl friend and she hasn't stopped listening to it. This is one of her favorite CD's
1419701533|5.0|Hilarious. Really hilarious. I just love all of these stories and the box set made a great gift for my boys.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Great game!!! I play a lot of puzzle games and this shows the advancements that are being made everyday. This game is not too hard but makes you think.  I agree about not using the hint button to make the game last. I will be closely watching for the next chapter. Hurry please !!!!!! I need more!!!!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this app its so fun. I wish I had more gems.<br />I gave it a five star rating
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|This was a great but sad tale with a bit of a surprise & happy ending for Jamie & Lily. I came to care about the characters and would have loved to hear more about their lives after the story ended.
B003F5WOEC|3.0|There is nothing wrong with this product. The LP sounds amazing and the inclusion do the CD and even a cool poster makes this a purchase well worth the money. The problem I have is with the Autorip feature. This purchase was supposed to include the mp3 version of the album, which would be added directly to the cloud player. Due to the fact that I clicked the box that said this purchase was a gift, the Autorip mp3 album was excluded from the purchase. This is mind-boggling! How can that possibly make a difference? If I wanted to give the record to one person, the CD to another while keeping the mp3s, I should be allowed to do this.  I am very dissatisfied. The Black Keys rock, though.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|I thought this was a great story with great music. A movie you can definitely watch more than once. Highly recommended.
B0070DOHQS|1.0|Abandonware, not updated in years. Does to work with PCI compliant servers. Support promised a fix months ago and did not deliver. AVOID product isn't maintained.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a very good game but to addicting. You should also make one where you can go fast on your feet!
B001PJRAUS|5.0|I absolutely adore Jane Austen, and this BBC production of a &#34;what if&#34; scenario is great!  The cast of characters are BRITISH PERFECT, when it comes to producing something equivalent to Downton Abbey, but here, they are all inversted into to Austin's greatest work. Reading Pride and Prejudice beforehand is an absolute necessity, as the dialogue is extracted, twisted and repackaged in this funny and beautifully realistic depiction of Austen's novel of early 19th century English gentry.  OK, you can get away with NOT READING, but to see how the script writers have cleverly reshaped the characters and even extracted dialogue from Austen's other works is truly an added delight.  Amanda Price is our 21st century &#34;Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court.&#34;  She is also independent, very sharp (like Elizabeth Bennett) and comes into the story at the very beginning. Her opportunity to be IN her favorite novel early on in the plot is so much the adventure of a lifetime.  Little does she realize the equally frightening potential to screw everything up!  Enjoy.
B007ZXK08C|3.0|Very good topic, and well explored, but I was very disappointed with the ending.  It stumbled to the finish.  I kept thinking it was the end and then there was more and a bit more.
B003DZX44I|1.0|The DVD in Blu-ray skips and you miss the last 8th of the movie. I should not have purchased the combo pack and wish that I hadn't.
B00BZODDYU|5.0|I loved if it is an amazing movie i wanna watch it again i hope others can like it just as much as i did
B004UHL9EK|5.0|I got this app as a FAOTD a week or so back and it virtually instantly replaced my old paid timer/alarm. Looks great and super configurable, but the preset settings are great if you just want to set it and forget it. My only suggestion would be an option to disable logging because really why do I need to know that I woke up for work last week? Bottom line, great choice to be your timer/alarm app.
B009MYARIK|5.0|As usual, Sophie Kinsella writes a funny and &#34;engaging&#34;?story.  (Pun intended)<br />What a fun weekend read this was, I stayed up late because it was quite compelling.
1451696191|5.0|This book is aimed to younger readers and I read it because my daughter enjoyed it so much. Well guess what?? I also enjoyed it! It was an interesting read and no matter how old they are everyone can relate at some point.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Many different types of puzzles. Have to think to do this game but hints are available if you get stuck. Lots of fun!
B00004UEDQ|5.0|My family and I enjoyed this movie.  Would recommend it for anyone going through something or not just a good family movie.
B000J1AGQI|1.0|You will only like this movie if you are REALLY into battle scenes, since 80% of this movie is blood, bullets, and lots of noise. If you are the slightest bit interested in seeing the deep range of emotions and politics surrounding Vietnam, skip this one at all costs.
B00871C09S|3.0|My mom remembered this movie as being one of her favorites  from when she was very young. We couldn't believer that we were able to order it and watch it. Hitchcock classic
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|I love horror movies, but rarely actually am scared by them This one was an exception - truly scary and well-done. I will say that the mythology of the &#34;evil character&#34; is kind of unbelievable, but other than that give this movie a very enthusiastic thumbs up! Well done!
1451695195|1.0|This was one of three books ordered and the top in box.  The cover and first page were caught in the box flap/packaging tape and torn about an inch and a half.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|...and the ring of truth give this dramedy an infinite depth and satisfaction comparable to \\"Billy Elliot\\" and \\"The Full Monty.\\" If the Broadway production cleans up at the Tony Awards [or if there's any won at all], credit must go to the compelling and charming Chiwetel Ejiofor's unstinting, all-out musical numbers, in drag on stage, which make this film feel like the updated \\"Cabaret,\\" with credible, lifelike post-2K issues and late-20th Century kitschy disco oldies like \\"Together We Are Beautiful\\" by Fern Kinney and \\"Yes Sir I Can Boogie\\" by Baccara. I'll miss these songs if the Broadway song score is entirely Cyndi Lauper originals.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Out of the blue my son (he is 8) told me that temple run 2 is much better than the first version.
B0050DIWFC|4.0|Definitely worth reading.  I couldn't put the book down and while some at our book club didn't like the ending, I found it to be very believable.
B003BW0CB6|5.0|I have been slowly building my Kindle library, and this author is one that is making his way into that library.
0743297334|4.0|In my recently published novel E Train to Masada which takes place in 1968, the main character compares Hemingway's lost generation of the 1920s to the protesters of the 1960s.  While Hemingway's Jake Barnes in The Sun Also Rises has been made impotent by a WWI wound, he bears his fate with stoicism, dignity and even detachment, whereas the draft card and Vietnam medal burning protestors and soldiers of the `60s express pure rage.  Hemingway's code of demonstrating manliness by standing one's ground \\"with grace\\" as the Cape Buffalo charges would be viewed as absurd and insane by the spectrum of 60's activists from students to professors to clerics to housewives.<br /><br />Which is not to say Hemingway's people are ethically decent at all times.  Robert Cohen is treated shabbily notwithstanding his Princeton education and championship boxing ability.  Jake Barnes and his waspy cohort refer to Cohen's pushiness, hang-dog tagging along and even his nose in conversations both direct and implicit regarding his Jewishness.  The bullying and belittling of Cohen to a significant degree drives the plot, making it impossible to avoid reading Cohen as a ready-made character that relieves Hemingway from the labor of character development.  One also wonders if this shortcut reflects the author's personal view of Jews?<br /><br />I have read The Sun Also Rises at least a half dozen times since the 60s but only lately have thoughts of the author as bully occurred.  Which raises the question, do the attitudes of the times affect ones reaction to literature or does a text deemed great in one era succumb to cultural shifts in another?
B00AYR2FOI|5.0|Went to see Bozz Skaggs and Michael McDonald in southern Oregon,and I was not disappointed at all.This album has been along time coming.There was a brief in Rolling Stone which they thankfully put on Twitter.the Bozz runs the gamut.The album will be here soon.And we won't be disappointed.well,I've only had a small amount of time to listen close and the music transcends all genre.I wish I could have played guitar the way he does.Back to Monkey Time.Jazz. Blues .Boogie.Rock and Roll.He's got it all.
B004DLPXAO|2.0|The beauty of ebook readers such as Kindle is the ability to use hyperlinking, note-taking, highlighting, and other features which rely on actuation via touch.  Sadly, the newest version of Kindle seems to have lost many of these functionalities.  As a reader, I find it extremely frustrating that I can no longer tap on a link to a chapter, word to highlight, or whatnot.  This makes the reader very clumsy and not user-friendly in the least.<br /><br />As an author with work published on Kindle, I am very upset that those who have purchased my work cannot navigate through the work as they were in previous versions of this app.  With the number of people who have complained of these non-functioning features, Kindle is making the experience of my readers (and all the other authors) a frustrating one.  Not good!  I had to revert to a previous version just to get the tap functions back.  I love the carousel, but I prefer the tap functions more.
B00APUYN0I|4.0|Fat amy really makes it but for the most part, this movie is simple fun and has several moments that will make you bust up laughing.
1250027624|5.0|Read it through before wrapping and particularly liked the pictures of objects of the time and the historical background on WWI.  I gave it, along with the Series III DVD, to my 24-yr-old granddaughter.  She loves the DVD and can't wait to read the book but doesn't want to come across a spoiler so she will not start reading until she finishes the DVD.
B007SSDS24|3.0|Ordered by accident and found ourselves pleasantly surprised. Not much of a story line, but pretty decent graphics. Worth it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I loved the original on PBS.  Told my granddaughter (24) about it, esp. Maggie Smith.  Granddaughter & roommate watched Series I & II free on special Netflix offer and loved it, esp. Maggie Smith.  She is now watching the DVD and loves it, too.  Isn't it great that Maggie can be loved by the twenty-somethings.
1451695195|5.0|Great book written on a controversial subuct, proof of heaven. Although the author didn't demonstrate actual proof, he did open many doors to think about.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|It is so addictive. I love it.You can play so many different<br />kind of games. And every time you try and fail five games you get points.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Favorite movie this year so far.. Best Actrress Award was well deserved.<br />.Not the usual romantic comedy. for a welcome change.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My 9 year old: \\"It has Cool people. Really awesome hover boards and different kinds of cops. And cool city's too. I like all the powers!\\"
B000I8FTY6|4.0|I watched this movie before...not the theaters, maybe on demand at home...? Anyway- I really liked this film. Actors are great, subject is comical and the soundtrack was just amazing- introduced me to another awesome band that I'll die loving!<br /><br />Great movie, not so appropriate for younger kids but maybe teens, esp the mother having some depression issues.

B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|As a man I am not one of those who can cry when watching a sad or heartfelt movie.  This movie really got to me, and I found myself starting to tear up at one point.  This was an awesome movie and I am happy that my wife made me sit through it.  I had to Google the family name and see if they truly existed, and they did.  This movie makes you think about what Mother Nature can do to people.  I would HIGHLY recommend seeing this movie, I am.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|Wonderfully addictive!  The clever design makes this so much fun!  Requires dexterity, thought and a bit of daring to work thru the entire maze.
B002X3V4P2|2.0|This is just a matter of different strokes for different folks.  There are two great and famous songs, but the rest all begin to sound the same to me.  Beautiful voice, great music, just gets old after a while.
0525953728|4.0|A fascinating account of life and training of Navy SEALs.  From the mundane building of a 60-lb pack to their justification of intense violence, the book captured the nature of these brave and dedicated men in a clear and understandable way.  The account of the Bin Laden mission was great theatre, but not the whole story of the book.  These men, their training, their bravery and intensity for me were the center of the book.  Hard to put down.<br /><br />Too bad it came along at same time as Zero Dark Thirty.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Evernote is my life saver! I use this all the time, I can access it from my phone, kindle fire, and from my computer. It really helps that I can have special or certain notes all the time.
B00CEF014E|3.0|This was a decent story and a pretty easy read, I read it in just one evening and it kept me interested. There were some good plot twists and the girl really stands up for herself, so overall, I liked it. I think some parts were kind of jumpy and it could have been expanded to make it smoother and a little more comfortable to read.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|I love to save pictures to my kindle then edit them with this app. It is by far the best one to edit pictures with! when i first downloaded it i sat on it for two days for literally 4 hours both days, just playing and learning all the ins and outs of picsart. I also have it on my phone but my kindles screen is much bigger and a lot easier to use and edit with.
B004KPX4W2|4.0|This is not an intellectual film. It's not a mind-blowing action film, and the story is not the shiniest. However, this movie is extremely enjoyable. I definitely recommend it if you are in the mood for some (slightly sick) action-comedy.
B003097ABA|5.0|If you like The Cars, this is all their best stuff in one collection at a great price! In my opinion, their first two albums, are what The Cars are all about, every song is Awesome!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|A challanging, fast moving game that tests ones dexterity to the hilt.  Changing obsticals demand close attention and coordination.  Hard to stop playing once into it, darn it !!
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I love this app.  Fun but with limits on your lives....it keeps me from spending too much time goofing off.  I play til my lives are gone and then I get on with life.  A++++
0385535147|5.0|iT WAS A PLEASURE READING A BOOK WHERE A SMART GUY GAMES THE SYSTEM AND ISN'T SCREWED IN THE END.
B004ZMWUCU|4.0|I got a slow start on this story because it was a bit hard for me to get accustomed to the Irish dialect and phrases.  As I caught on to the characters' language, I found it to be charming story.
1616550414|5.0|I am a huge Legend of Zelda fan. This book has a lot of information about the history and making of this video game series. It has a lot of beautiful illustrations of the characters, landscapes, and concept art of all of the LoZ games. I enjoy owning this book and I would recommend this product to anyone who likes The Legend of Zelda games.
B004H6G0TI|4.0|The concept and gameplay is pretty excellent.  However, there are a very limited amount of levels and the unlockable planes aren't unique enough to waste time grinding to unlock them.  It would have been better if you were given a base plane and then play to unlock the speed, armor, design, and weapon upgrades to customize your plane.  Adding achievements, as is the current trend for casual mobile games, would also add a bit more longevity to this title.<br /><br />But for what it is, its a good, cheap time-waster for the week or so it takes you to beat it.
B004WR125O|1.0|Refused this item!
B0064X7FVE|4.0|It works. Sometimes it is off but so is the weather man. And you can look at multiple locations which is always so so nice.
B00BSBY38A|5.0|A welcome change from the plot-challenged, FX-driven movies so prevelent today. Not a chick-flick romance either. Something new and original.<br />.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I love facebook but this one seems to not update enough for me. It like moves things around and it isn't in the correct order by time and I hate that.
B00BLGXL3U|2.0|I did not like this movie.  I kept waiting for it to get good.  The actors did a great job, but the movie was so strange, it had no purpose and it was like watching somebody's nightmare.  I was glad when it was over and the ending was terrible.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|That is what the books are. They are just so emotional. I just cant put it down! I stayed up till like 4am to finish!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|I loved this movie.  It was a complete surprise from the usual violent movie formula. It was very well done, tastefully done, artfully done.  The acting was so good, unbelievably good.  My family and I watched it three times when we rented it. We cracked up all through the movie.<br /><br />I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 14.
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I play this when I should be working heehee. I love UNO though but I like not having to actually hold the cards. I feel so lazy!
B000UR9QGW|5.0|This is the second to the Evil dead. Another scary and campy and fun movie. A great movie with Bruce Campbell.
B004SD5GZ4|1.0|I didn't use it enough to know whether I liked it or not. I think it is ok though. Check it.
B003IY48PS|5.0|I remember seeing this on tv and thought how funny it was. A comedy horror and great camera work. I am so glad that it came out on bluray. I love this movie. It might be a low budget movie but it is one movie that became a classic.. So check this scary and campy fun movie.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|Beautiful ending, though I wish it kept going and going and going! I liked that everything worked out pretty well.
B00AZNEW5G|5.0|This certainly gives you a window and bird's eye view of the events leading to Osama bin Laden's death. For history buffs, I highly recommend it.
B004GHNIRK|2.0|Eh, I am just not into it. I didn't even watch the movie that is how blah about it I am.
B000VDDDY6|5.0|Packaging is very impressive. The film quality re-mastered is truly superb and beyond comparision. The product is excellent and I highly recommend.
B008ZOHCKE|4.0|It is neat that you can have like a gazilllion different notebooks! And make them look how you want! I used it for dreams and then just as a diary.
B0017VG69U|5.0|Packaging is very impressive. The film quality re-mastered is truly superb and beyond comparision. The product is excellent and I highly recommend.
B004UNX1LS|5.0|Sometimes youTube wont let me watch on my phone but VEVO allllllllways does! Heck yea! And it has all the new stuff!
B005J9ZFQG|5.0|Love this movie! It's better than the first one. Definitely a horror classic and the first of its kind in that time.
0736041850|5.0|This was very detailed in an easy to remember manner which helped tremendously with my PT certifications. Also a great aid to have on hand for refreshers courses.
B004774D14|5.0|Este libro es casi mágico. La historia de amor mezclada con eventos y celebraciones especiales y tradicionales de un país lleno de riqueza culinaria como México lo hacen simplemente mágico. Me encanta la comparación de las situaciones con la forma en que reaccionan los ingredientes de cada receta. Es sensual, es rica en cultura, es una historia deliciosa.
1592537251|5.0|I really like the variety of information on this subject; as it is one of the subjects that I have most difficulty drawing. It gives helpful tips as well as shows different examples how several different artists approached different subjects and conditions.
0767812166|5.0|Starman is a fun space movie, incorporating the human possibilities of us being observed by other observers from other planets.
B005IT0V8O|5.0|For writers of all kinds, the necessity of perfect grammar will get your point across. This book will keep you in check. Read it often so no one misunderstands your point
B002HWRYJE|4.0|Being an old lady of 63, I prefer the G-rated status of the original Star Treks. However this is an excellent updated version.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|not gonna lie wish it was free, but I really like this game. It actually gives you a pretty good amount of free game time. Absolutely worth downloading
B002I9Z8I0|5.0|I have always enjoyed the Star Trek original movies. These are fun for the whole family and even the young teenagers of today enjoy them.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have been playing this on my kindle. It works great and has given me many hours of entertainment. Would reccommed it for older folks also.
B0001I562I|5.0|The young actor was tremendous in making the robot-run ship come to life. This is a fun movie to show at home or school  for reward time.
0061906220|5.0|Everyone loves Pete the Cat and how cool he is when stuff happens to him. He won't let it ruin his day.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|Archer has done it again, twists and turns unexpected, characters we must meet again, can't wait for the sequel to this one!
B0095P29EG|5.0|Great movie, and watching it on instant video with my playstation was an easy way to watch it on my tv. I like not having a DVD to get messed up, this is an issue for me because my job requires me to move a lot
B00BHNR1KQ|5.0|Movie was a lot scarier than I thought it was going to be. See it as soon as you can.
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Liked the movie very much but it kept buffering which was annoying.<br />Would recommend to those that like this genre.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I cannot decide whether I like this album or his latest better. Every time I listen to &#34;If I Walk Away&#34; it stirs my emotions.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|This movie is amazing, it has an amazing soundtrack, action scenes, dialouge, acting, scenery, and very funny at times, BUY IT.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|I really enjoy this music.  I've played it over and over! I like his voice and the combination of styles.
B0070DOHQS|3.0|App works great under local WiFi, but receives a Connection 4.103 Error when trying to use 3G/4G (I used VNC Automatic setup).  Support showed other users having the same problem from 2012, but no resolved answer was given.  This error might just be with Moto phones, I notice that 3G/4G gets turned off on my phones temporarily after receiving the error.<br /><br />The TightVNC app that they use is just shady in general, even after closing the app I could still control my PC over WiFi, and Task Manager showed that it did not close completely. TightVNC will not close from task manager either, I had to completely uninstall the app.  Something like a remote program should be EASILY TIRNED OFF to stop all connections.<br /><br />Also no Right Click quick option on the bottom of the screen, just keyboard quick options.<br /><br />Sorry for grammer, on cell phone.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Loving this game for my 5yr old son great game for for free...thanks so much for making this game for the kindle fire love it love it....thank u thank u
B008J05EL8|5.0|. . . . . about not getting free stuff or having to pay for something a) generally are driving pretty nice cars b) generally make an adequate amount of money to serve their needs and c) have a high sense of entitlement.<br /><br />I also remember having to pay for extra fonts, back in the day.  I appreciate all the hard work that goes into software--even apps--and am happy to fork over the cost of a cup of coffee so someone else can have a paying job that feeds a family.<br /><br />So, nice additional font package.

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I am a professional writer and have been pleased with this suite so far.  I have only used the Word function, but have had no problems with crashing, freezing or losing anything. (Knock on wood.)  I like that the &quot;save&quot; function is prominent and easy to access.  Many people have complained about the lack of  included fonts, and the fact that you have to pay extra, but, honestly, I remember having to pay extra for fonts when I was first using PCs.  I am sure they did a study on price points and figured they had to go that route.  Anyway, not having the font package when I started using this in no way detracted from my ability to outline a novel.  The font package may be great for when I am editing, so I paid for it.  Also works great so far.
B00BSBUZPK|4.0|I purchased the 3-DVD BluRay package back when they were announced.  I had already seen the documentary on Showtime, so I was paying $40 for the bonus disc (ie, the \\"exclusive concert\\" mentioned in their description). Popped in the concert disc, and was absolutely blown away by the quality of the audio / video.  Then the \\"concert\\" ends after eight songs.  WTF!!!!!  The Eagles website NOW says:<br /><br />\\"Apr 30, 2013 History of the Eagles, the iconic band's acclaimed documentary, is now available on DVD, Blu-Ray and as a limited edition super deluxe box set.

B00BAXTYDK|5.0|Genesis, I want it!  Finally we get to see this great movie in Blu-ray and it looks great compared to the depressing video tape.  I can't believe I paid the same amount of money for the VCR tape as I did for this Blu-Ray ($10) and that was in 1980's dollars!  \\"Your request is not Logical.\\"  This is also such an improvement to my old single layer DVD which didn't even have any bonus features.  The video quality is 10 times better!  \\"Perfect!  Than that's the way it shall be!\\"  The aspect ratio is really 2.35:1 even though Amazon keeps getting it wrong and says 1.85:1.  It better be 2.35:1 \\"or I shall be very, very angry.\\" (The Squire Of Gothos).  And the lossless Dolby TrueHD 7.1 soundtrack sounds very good even with headphones.  \\"How can you be deaf with ears like that?!\\"  You get a lot of the bonus features in HD including BD Live.  It's also great that they upgraded the Theatrical Trailer to HD.  \\"That's not your usual poison.\\"  Buy this movie and \\"You're going to get a nice long rest doctor.\\"  I highly recommend it.  This isn't reality, this is fantasy!<br /><br />I have what you want.  I have the secret of Genesis!  You're going to have to buy this Blu-ray to get it!  You hear me?  I'm waiting for you!  What is your answer?  Maltz... Jol yichu!

B00A83075M|2.0|Wreck-it Ralph was a film that dared to dream big.  The premise, according to all the commercials, was about video game characters coming to life when the arcade closes and meeting with one another in their off hours.  In the midst of all this, a video game bad guy named Ralph decides that he's sick of being a villain and wants to become a hero and earn a medal, but where would a big, tough, giant of a man with enormous hands be able to earn a medal?<br /><br />Showcasing Ralph's quest, and the many encounters with characters from -real- video games, the ads for the film promised the story of a strong, powerful protagonist who faces insurmountable odds and achieves his goal of truly getting the recognition that he deserves.  There were also some brief clips of some little, candy brat doing a stupid and un-funny routine where she insults him for no reason, but at worst, we thought, she'll be like Timon and Puumba; a latecomer who's annoying at times, but doesn't disrupt the movie.<br /><br />Big mistake.<br /><br />As I saw it, there were four big factors in this movie; four things that it seemed to be trying to accomplish.<br /><br />1. Ralph's impressiveness as a main character.<br /><br />2. The fun of the journey and the search for the reward.<br /><br />3. The reforming of Ralph into a hero, and the handling of heroism in general in the movie; its moral center.<br /><br />4. The presence and relevance of the other video game characters from other video games.<br /><br />I'm going to be judging the film on its handling of each of these areas, since, when you get down to it, these are the areas in which the movie had a chance to really shine.<br /><br />1. There's no doubt that Ralph had a lot of potential as a hero, and it's been a while since we've seen a hero of his type.  He's 9 feet tall, weighs over 600 lbs, and his fists are larger than his head.  Not only that, but given the length of his arms, this is clearly the sort of bruiser who you don't want to tangle with in a straight-up fight.  Ralph has the potential to be a terrifying enemy, or an incredible hero; a man's man, who gets the job done, and almost threatens to bring the notion back into the public eye, that men can be heroes too.<br /><br />The only question is; how much of this potential was used?  Sadly, the answer is \\"hardly any.\\"<br /><br />Ralph does get to use his great strength, speed and smashing powers on a semi-regular basis, but as for coming across as a bruiser, or a manly guy, who one might actually want to be like, there's almost none of that here.<br /><br />Ralph is played up, from the very start, as a comedy fall guy.  In his early attempts to acquire a medal, he blunders around, panics, trips, falls, gets yelled at, sets off traps and activates dozens of deadly enemy bug-eggs.  Still, these things can happen, even to a very impressive hero.<br /><br />Unfortunately, Ralph's personality is done little better.  He's portrayed largely as an unthreatening, sitcom oaf, who has his desires and all that, but never needs to be taken too seriously, and sure enough, the other characters don't take him seriously at all.  He complains about not getting cake, whines when he's stopped by the embodiment of a surge protector, and generally acts sad and mopey over his lot in life, and even when he decides to take action, it's done in more of a \\"ah-ha!  I have a plan!\\" way, rather than demonstrating real, strong determination to change his life.<br /><br />However, perhaps the worst thing about Ralph's presentation as the main character is that he's really -not- the main character.  That honor is reserved for Vanilly... Vanelly...  Sarah Silverman, who plays a bratty little girl from a candyland-inspired slot car racing game called \\"Sugar Rush,\\" (which, like \\"Fix-it Felix Jr,\\" Ralph's game, is not a real game at all.)  About a third of the way into the movie, Ralph finds himself in Sugar Rush, and then that's pretty much it.  The part of the movie that you wanted to see, about Ralph struggling to attain his goal and being a cool main character is pretty much over.<br /><br />The Sarah Silverman character steals Ralph's medal and runs off, trouncing and outdoing him in climbing, running and pretty much everything else with embarrassing ease.  Try to imagine your favorite baseball player getting up to bat, and being just -utterly humiliated- by a five-year-old girl with a squeaky voice, who thinks she's funny, and isn't.  As spacious as Ralph's faults may be, he's still supposed to be the main character, and we don't want to see this done to him.<br /><br />However, you'd better get used to it.  Sarah Silverman continues humiliating Ralph.  She's annoying and bratty, never learns a single lesson of any value, and yet, the director wants us to believe she's always right.  Sarah Silverman is annoying, even when she's -not- saddled with this kind of role.  Frankly, the whole thing from this point on made me wince, particularly since we're apparently supposed to start caring about her, and want her to succeed, even though she's already proven that she's a liar and a thief, and doesn't care about Ralph -at all.-  No.  Just no.  This movie fails to make Ralph an impressive, manly main character, because he's not nearly as impressive as he should be, comes off as more oafish than manly, and isn't even the main character.<br /><br />2. Is the journey any fun?  Are we excited to see whether or not Ralph will get his reward?  Well, no.  Not really.  Even at the start, Ralph's motives for wanting the medal are a little materialistic and unsatisfying.  He seems less concerned with being appreciated than with medals, and cakes and penthouses; things that you can touch.  His reasons for going on the quest just felt too physical to me.  It's not like Aladdin, who wants to be treated as more than just street scum, or Belle, who wants some excitement and something transcendent;  beyond her normal life.  These are purely material desires,and frankly, I can't sympathize.<br /><br />As I said, Ralph tends to panic and flee when he's confronted with difficult and dangerous circumstances, which puts a massive damper on the excitement and fun of the quest.  You might as well just admit that Ralph; whatever his potential, isn't much of a hero at this point, and of course, a fun quest that does not make.<br /><br />If it's not fun at -that- stage, it's certainly a great deal -less- fun when Sarah Silverman is introduced, and the movie takes a hard left turn away from the quest that it was supposed to be about.  Eventually, it's completely forgotten.<br /><br />Now, this is not necessarily a bad thing.  In many movies, the initial motivation is for riches, or power, or recognition, and the character ultimately learns that these are not as important as family and happiness, and doing the right thing.  All well and good.<br /><br />The problem is that in -this- movie, what replaces the medal is -not- good, wholesome values, but just Ralph's desire to be \\"liked\\" by Sarah Silverman, and doing things that will make her feel better.  This is a problem for two reasons.  1. Being liked is not a virtue.  2. Doing things that make people feel better is not a virtue.  This movie replaces shallow materialism with the slightly-less-shallow motive of wanting to be liked by at least one person.  A fun quest that does not make.<br /><br />3. What is the moral center of the movie?  Is Ralph a hero?  Is he made into a hero, and does he reform?  Is this a story of a person reforming from their evil ways?<br /><br />Well, no.  It's not.  The premise of the film is that all characters in video games are essentially actors playing roles.  Therefore, the heroes are often not terribly heroic, and the villains not terribly villainous, once you catch them off-duty.  Therefore, no real reforming needs to be done.  Ralph isn't a -real- villain.  He just plays one on TV.<br /><br />Of course, this raises several questions.  Why do thehero and the NPCs treat Ralph like an outcast outside of work hours?  Isn't that -actually- evil?  I mean, he didn't do anything wrong.  He just did what he was supposed to do; wreck the building, so Felix could fix it.  Ralph was just doing what he was hired (essentially) to do.  The reaction of the NPCs is essentially elitism on the basis of the pre-determined caste system that was programmed into them, and ultimately, that makes them the real bad guys for most of the movie.<br /><br />Strangely, many of the other video game villains seem similar to Ralph in that sense; not horrible people; just actors doing their jobs.<br /><br />Here's the problem.  Throughout the entire movie, they continue using the word \\"bad\\" to mean \\"the role of villain in a game,\\" and \\"good\\" to mean \\"the role of hero in a game,\\" and that is -not- what those words mean.  I almost got the impression that the movie was trying to imply that -real- good and evil were as insubstantial as the roles that one plays in the acting profession, which is just a total rejection of the most basic foundations of all true knowledge.  It's a false as false can be.<br /><br />This aspect of the film really comes to a head when Ralph performs a truly heroic act near the movie's end, while reciting the \\"bad guy affirmation,\\" about how he'll never be \\"good,\\" and the only thing he wants to be is himself.  If there is one line that can utterly kill the substance of an act of heroic self-sacrifice on the part of a main character, this is it.<br /><br />In the end, of course, people start to appreciate Ralph a little more, and treat him a little better, but through it all, the substance of -real- good and evil is lost in the dust.  Heroism is demonstrated, but not addressed, and the movie's moral core seems to aim, rather, at a sort of Hollywood, rich-people, anti-moralism than any sort of actual moral message that a kid could understand or benefit from.<br /><br />4. That brings us to the final area on which this movie should be judged; the video game characters who make appearances.  I got the impression that this movie wanted to emulate \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit,\\" which had a lot of guest-appearances by other characters from other cartoons, from Bugs Bunny to Mickey Mouse.  This is, in fact, the aspect of the film that's showcased most in the trailers; the video game guest stars, but I hope you enjoyed those trailers, because they covered -nearly all- of the guest appearances by real game characters in this movie.<br /><br />The bad guy meeting has a bunch of guest characters, then there are the brief scenes in game central station, and a scene in the Tapper video game.  Q-bert and his pals show up in a few more scenes, but aside from those, that's pretty much all the guest appearances you'll see, most of which, as I said, are in the film's first third, before the Sugar Rush debacle.<br /><br />Yes, it's charming to see these characters rendered in 3D.  Yes, it's fun to see them in a high-profile movie.  However, they don't act like the characters in the games, because they're not.  They're just actors playing roles.  As for the rest, it's a minor thrill with little or no substance behind it.  I got that thrill from the trailers, but the film had little to offer after that in this area.<br /><br />The other aspect that I thought would be a mainstay of the plot was traversing one video game world after another in Ralph's quest.  Guess how many he travels to.  Go ahead.  Guess.<br /><br />Two.<br /><br />Ralph goes to the bad guy meeting in the Pac-Man game, though it just looks like a blank room during the scene itself.  He then spends two scenes in the video game \\"Tapper,\\" where he drinks and talks to Tapper about his problems.  Apart from this, none of the worlds that Ralph visits are based off real video games, except for Fix-it Felix Jr itself, which I'm not going to count, because it's just an online game that was made to promote the film.  I'm not counting that.<br /><br/>The only other worlds that Ralph visits are Hero's Duty and Sugar Rush, and there are no games for those.  You will never play Hero's Duty.  You will never play Sugar Rush.  They don't exist, and they never will.<br /><br />Roger Rabbit was a multi, mega cartoon crossover masterpiece, and a darn good story in its own right, and that's what Wreck-it Ralph could have been.  A multi, mega, video game crossover masterpiece, and a darn good story in its own right.  However, it sank its own story when it decided to be about Sarah Silverman, rather than an awesome, heroic title character, and it's certainly not the massive video game crossover that the ads suggest.<br /><br />Conclusion<br /><br />In the final analysis, this movie fails or does poorly on nearly every level.  It's not -that bad- compared to some recent animated films, allegedly for kids, but this says more about the state of modern children's entertainment than it does about Wreck-it Ralph.  I give it a nearly halfway grade for this reason, but I have to be honest here; I consider this film to be a major disappointment.  It seemed to have great promise, and whatever else you can say about it, you can't say it made good on that promise.
B00CL68QVQ|2.0|In the beginning the movie was very good and realistic, and then, it just fell apart and became corny and stupid in the end I'm sorry to say. Also, Jennifer Lawrence was good, but, she didn't deserve an Oscar for this role, but, I do think she is a very good little actress though. The film in and of itself I'm sorry to say just became very stupid, and corny. If, you want to see this film, I kinda have to suggest that you should wait when it only cost $1.99 or when it's free on prime I'm sorry to say, Hollywood, has lost it's originality! They're just not worth listening to anymore! I'm so sorry if I sound mean or hateful, but, it just wasn't an overall good movie. Sorry.

The sound and video are beautifully done.  The arrangements are spectacular.  I just can't say enough good things about this concert.  I would, however, suggest you get the DVD rather than the VHS tape.

I will probably become a loyal fan<br />of his now as well.

I have to now figure out if I can get my money back!
B0094K1MH2|5.0|This was a nice surprise. The animation was fantastic and totally intriguing.  The story was good, with some twists and turns, a little humor now and then.  Good movie for families with kids about 8 and up.  (8 because the story line was just not for little kids.)

B0050DIWFC|5.0|Couldn't put this one down. Thought about it a lot even when I wasn't able to read it. Questions the concept of unconditional support for our children, indeed anyone, the separation all parents go through as our kids grow from children to adults, and the blind idea that we know what's best for them. Nurture v. Nature is an ongoing dilemma!
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|This was a tall order to finish in one book while trying to meet all expectations... given the circumstances I think it was an excellent conclusion.  It leaves you wanting more, but in a way that is how it should be... after all \\"there are no endings in the wheel of time.\\"

B0091IMFF0|2.0|I bought this product a few months ago for work. I work in the security industry and the product fell apart since I used it all the time. The pin at the end of the cord was loose and wiring extruded from the end of it. It also makes a very \\"cheesy\\" plastic clicking sound every time you hold down the push-to-talk button. I got a refund for it, but if you are going to rely on a speaker mic don't rely on this one. Camping once a month is about the extent this product can endure.

B00BF123WG|5.0|While I knew what this was about, I wasn't sure how the story would be told.  The story of the CIA analyst is compelling, and I think it worked through all the controversial issues surrounding the last 10 years in a fair manner.  I watched this alone since my wife isn't big on blood, guns, and guts, but there was much less of that than I expected, and I thought the story was well told.  Worthy of the awards it's gotten.

B001UTW7QU|5.0|I really like watching this!  Didn't start until it was over and really glad it is on Amazon Prime.  I have to watch at least 2 (really like to watch 3) episodes at a time.  There are a couple of episodes I don't like (not a bug fan and let's just say, they appear where they shouldn't), but overall, very entertaining show!  It's got me hooked!
B0055MBQOM|3.0|I have a Dell Desktop with an regular Dell monitor(1), and a Dell laptop that is sometimes hooked up to a different Dell monitor (2).  I  installed and read all the instructions and watched a few youtube videos describing the process.  I tested the product on my Dell Laptop and the Dell monitor (2).  I followed the video instructions, and went with Easy adjustments.  It calibrated for ~5 minutes (per the on-screen prompt), and when it was finished my screen came out nuclear green.  I furrowed my brow, and tried advance calibration next.  About 5 minutes later, it was no longer nuclear green, but the whites were definitely not &#34;white.&#34;<br /><br />I gave up on my Dell monitor (2) and started working on my Dell laptop monitor.  Again, about 5 minutes later, it finished calibrating, and I get a muddy mess of brown and over adjusted whites and blacks.  I tried to save and I got a LUT error.  I furrowed my brow again, and tried again.  Same mess of brown, and LUT error.  I gave up, and switched back to my default profile.<br /><br />Next, I tried to calibrate my Dell monitor (1).  I went with Easy, adjusted for ambient lighting, and went through the paces.  This time, my monitor came out slightly warmer, which is what I felt it should have done, and everything looked great.  It was very simple.  About a week later, the little tray icon reminded me to readjust, and I did it again.  There was no noticeable change, and I was happy with the result.<br /><br />In summary, it's a great product when it works, and it's frustrating when it doesn't.  I was very close to returning it.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|I loved this book.  It was a good study of dysfunction in human interaction, with good 'twists and turns'.  It was a book club selection for my book club.  Thoroughly enjoyed the book.
B008OOYALE|2.0|Sorry to say it but this game is tipped heavily toward ios players. It would be a better game if there was more equality between the different formats.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I know most people liked this book, but I did not find it very interesting.  I did not like either of the main characters, did not like the story line, and found it impossible to relate to any character in the story.  I think a good story pulls the reader into the plot, making you believe the story on some level, but I found this story line completely unbelievable.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|Laugh out loud funny if you have that British sense of humor. Also terribly sad, terribly real. A very original story.
B002V0GZ9M|5.0|Awesome movie about love and patience.  Great characters, great story and a big life lesson!  Love, love, love this movie - great music too!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Loving this game.  Started in Sydney now in Tokyo.  The missions and daily challenges are fun.  I am always going one mord time cause I have to beat my last time.  FUN FUN FUN!![[ASIN:B009UX2YAC Subway Surfers (Kindle Tablet Edition)]]
B003JUGQ38|5.0|The last Doctor Who I watched was Tom Baker.  I only recently discovered they were doing it again.  I like all the new doctors - hard to pick a favorite.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Very pretty, enjoyable and requires a little bit of thought.  I really am looking forward to the next installment. This game is like a cross between a rubiks cube and a strange dream.  Quite surreal.  I like it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I liked this book so much that I read Dark Places immediately after. She's a really good writer. Probably one of my new favorites.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game has beautiful graphics.  Much better then the games where the figures move just there mouth or they just sit there and do nothing.  I think this game has just the right amount help.  I like the pinch and zoom and maps features.  There isn't anything I have complaints about.  Did I mention. how beautiful. the graphics are?
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Wow amazing if u love action!!! Full of exciting battles ( not really any blood all of the blood is made by rocks or something)  ( my kids LOVED it same with me)
B00821PCJS|5.0|One of the best Syfy thrillers I have seen in a long time! The action, acting, and story line will keep you coming back for more!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It's definitely one of my favorites. The graphics are great and I've never had any trouble with it. It's a vet addicting game that is a lot of fun. I highly recommend this game. So buy it now.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I love the Big Bag Theory so of course, I love this DVD! The price was good, it was in stock which isn't always the case in stores and it was shipped quickly so I could start watching right away!
B003TSEEDY|4.0|pretty good, kind of slow. and the ending i felt was lackluster. very depressing I will say. felt bad for main character.
B009R659L8|5.0|Mary Higgins Clark books are always my favorite books.  She is the best author.  I lo e the surprise at the end.
0307352153|4.0|The author definitely wrote this book like a lawyer giving an argument.  First she used quite a bit of anecdotal evidence to try and suck you in. However, her exaggerated language about extroverts was over the top and at times inappropriate.<br /><br />However, this book redeems itself after the first third as the author starts to dig into actual data regarding introverts vs extroverts and all of the gray areas in between.  The education section at the end was a bit lacking in breadth, but the part on introvert/extrovert relationships, as well as parenting introverts was very interesting.<br /><br />This book kept my attention, but the author didn't leave me feeling like I could trust her educated opinion on the topic, since she seems to be so adamantly opposed to all things extrovert.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|She has this game on several different platforms, and it just doesn't get old. Recommend for anyone who likes casual games.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|The seller is great although the product is not easy to use. Find it comes apart easy when trying to cut bottle.<br />Shipping was great. The three star rating is for the product only. Not for the seller.
B0011UGLK6|3.0|I read this book for my Book Club and didn't realize that it was just a collection of short stories when I started reading.  That, in itself, would be ok, but only two of the stories were somewhat connected through the characters.  None of them were a complete story with a conclusion.  The story would just end abruptly leaving the reader asking the questions &#34;what happened?&#34; and &#34;is that all?&#34;  I quickly understood the author's message was to show the social structure in India and how it continued throughout other countries, but it was repeated much too often with no new information or insight.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|....was no surprise for me!  I missed the first episode of this season so I ordered this DVD and watched the entire season in two days.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|The only reason I am giving this game 3 stars is Gameloft trying to line their pockets and the constant glitches in the game. I'll be damned if I'm going to spend money on a pretend pony. I love MLP but this game can get expensive if you don't have a TON of patience. Way to try to line your pockets Gameloft.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|There are cool obstacles you have to avoid, jump over or roll under.  The music is easy to listen to also.
B003VIWO8Y|4.0|It was interesting.  Didn't know much about Dave, now I do. It was interesting to read of his journey from Metallica to Megadeath and his struggles.
0618918248|5.0|The God Delusion is a provocative must-read book for all. It has been described by many as life-changing, and while it didn't change my life, I can attest to it's ability to do so.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I have this game on my Kindle Fire and it is awesome, the only downside is that it freezes sometimes.
0345308239|4.0|As a Vietnam era Vet I was interested into her incite into some of the pre-war mistakes in judgement that led us into the misadventure in Vietnam. These lessons could applied today with regard to IRAQ and Afghanistan.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Many ways to describe subway surfers. All of them good. Fluent non laging game. But sometimes my kindle doesn't update it regularly like it It's supposed to. But that might just be my kindle.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Her cousins have it on their Kindle and she wanted it (i thought it would just be a boy thing) but she loves it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Seeing how Katniss as the Mocking Jay and her risking her life to save Pests and as many people in Panem is so Epic!
B00992CF6W|5.0|its an all and all good game only you can mine redstone but u don't get anything out of if!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is the bestest series I've watched in a very long time.  What is really neat about it, to me, is that I sit and knit while watching, and sometimes I don't follow the story as carefully as I should, so when the next season pops up, and they review the previous season, I see I've missed a lot of important story, so it will give me great pleasure to have a reason to watch it all again.<br /><br />The scenery is wonderful, the costuming is wonderful.  The characters are wonderful.  There's nothing better than a thorough disliking of a character and hoping he/she gets their just desserts!<br /><br />Life is good.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is the first Nicholas Sparks book that I have read and I couldn't be more pleased!!<br />LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT! :)
B008YU0AOE|4.0|I like it.  I can see it and it does all the calculations I need it to because I am no good with Math after I've counted my 10 fingers.
B0070DOHQS|3.0|After playing around with this program, purchased as a FAotD, I have to say this is almost but not quite a great app.  I've only ever used Splashtop so my comparisons can only be made against that program.<br /><br />This app has several positives in its favor:<br /><br />* Setup is relatively easy.  In my case, the installer had to download a second program called TightVNC since my copy of Win XP doesn't have RDP built-in. This process was entirely automated.  The only hitch here is if you're using Google Two Step authentication, which is a pain in the rear.  You'll need to generate a custom password just for this program for it to work if you use 2-step.  The setup instructions for the desktop client mention this under the troubleshooting section and link to the two-step help page on Google, which is nice.<br /><br />* The connection appears to be secure.  I'll be honest, I wasn't aware that Splashtop didn't use a secure connection.  I'm not sure how much of a threat this could be, but if security is an issue for you, this is definitely the pick over Splashtop.  For me, I'm not sure it's really something to worry about.  Besides needing your Google password to log in to this app, you'll need to pick a password to access TightVNC.<br /><br />* On-screen tools in the app are well thought out.  Compared to Splashtop, this layout and setup are awesome.  I especially love the enlarged cursor and it's \\"bubble\\" that make precision pointing/clicking easy even when zoomed out a good bit.  The text on some keys is very small, though, on my phone's 1080p screen.  Those keys are hard to read but the button size is good so it's difficult to hit the wrong button.  And the three-dot Android menu button hides/shows the special app buttons for a full screen experience.<br /><br />* CPU use on the desktop side.  One aggravation with Splashtop is, when it's active on the desktop, my poor little decade-old CPU is running 75-85% just for the remote access program.  This makes everything else run slower than molasses in January.  Jump DOES take a CPU toll, but not nearly as much as Splashtop.  I found it easier to edit large audio files remotely because of this.<br /><br />* Doesn't resize the desktop's screen when in use.  For whatever reason, Splashtop resizes my desktop to a lower resolution when it's in use.  This is not something one would normally notice when using these apps as intended, but it still bugs me because it seems so unnecessary.  Jump doesn't touch the screen resolution.<br /><br />This app also has several negatives working against it:<br /><br />* It's not exactly a pretty interface.  OK, I'm starting off with the most trivial aspect.  The Android app looks like a direct copy of the iOS version.  Yuck.  We have our own design standards!  On both the app and desktop sides, it's rather bland looking, graphically.  It's obvious the folks who created this have mad programming skills, but not mad art skills.<br /><br />* No audio, and slow video.  RDP supports audio, so if you can use it, go for it.  VNC does not.  I know it's not the app's fault, but its biggest competitor (Splashtop) managed to work around this.  Regardless of who's fault it is, it detracts from the user experience.  Unless you don't care for audio, then never ye mind.  Despite proclamations of fast and smooth rendering, I found it to be choppy on the app-side of things.  There's certainly no way you could watch a video or play a game through this, whereas Splashtop can do this.  In-browser content during my test painted on the phone very slowly and an animated Flash ad came across as a slideshow instead of as smooth video. For the record, the PC is wired directly to the router and the wireless was running at 72 Mbps throughput during tests.  The cellular network tests were done with 4G LTE which clocked a speed test of 51.25 Mbps before testing commenced.  I don't think it was network speed that caused the slow rendering.<br /><br />* TightVNC seems iffy.  It'savailable independently on Sourceforge and seems to be well respected, but I don't like the fact that it and Jump leave two icons in my taskbar when running.  It's inelegant.  I exited TightVNC and tried to log in and was still able to access my PC remotely, even when NOT on the same network.  This is troubling.  Like VNC's lack of audio this may not be THIS app's fault, but it mars the user experience.  Killing the Jump and TightVNC processes is futile, they come back automatically.  This to me seems like a MAJOR oversight.  Splashtop may be less secure, but I can turn it off and it's really off.<br /><br />* Cheaper alternatives.  If you trust TightVNC, they recommend their own remote desktop program, called Remote Ripple, for Android devices.  It's just $1.99 in the Play store, although it appears to lack the userbase and panache of Jump.<br /><br />Overall, this is not a bad program.  It does what it says, is easy to set up and has a few usability tricks up its sleeve that are hard to look past.  But the persistent behavior of both TightVNC and Jump on the desktop side are cause for concern.  Perhaps if you have a high end system at home and a high end Android smart phone, video and audio will work smoothly for you.  For the rest of us on \\"compromised\\" systems, Splashtop remains the better bet for smooth rendering and audio pass-through capabilities.  If your work doesn't involve video or audio work, then this is probably a better choice since it's much easier to use.available independently on Sourceforge and seems to be well respected, but I don't like the fact that it and Jump leave two icons in my taskbar when running.

B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|A movie about a tsunami in Thailand...and yet for a long time into the movie all we saw was white people and it was a contest to see who could spot a non-white person in a scene.  We aren't just talking the family, we are talking whole scenes of people at the place of lodging.<br />Then when the Tsunami hits...all you see for the majority of it is members of the same family. No bodies in the water floating, no other people.<br />And the lengths they went to show Watt's boob was actually funny.  Dance-like scene at the beginning...boob.  Tsunami scene, oops boob is out.  Operating scene...there it is again.<br /><br />Overall, it's a decent movie but I expected something more realistic being that it was based on a true story.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book left me wanting more just like her I can't wait to read the second book along with the third
B008TUDI2A|5.0|This CD/DVD set delves deeply into Wispelwey's thoughts on the Bach Suites.<br /><br />I loved his Suites at Tanglewood a few years ago, even though on his &#34;modern&#34; cello.<br /><br />I have to say this is the oddest performance of the Suites I have ever heard.  I keep listening and it's growing on me,  I wish I could hear it live and give it a chance.<br /><br />You will be surprised, excited, gratified and mystified.  I'm glad I have it, and listen often.

B0049J0CTM|1.0|Couldn't get this to work on my kindle. I know it's only $2, but if I am going to pay for something, I want it to work. I want my money back.
B00BSBUZPK|4.0|Only misses the 5 star rating because it's an 8 song partial concert.  I'm sure they will be releasing the full concert at a later time to cash in.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love playing this game it's fun and relaxing. My husband and I are in a race for top score position he's beating me right know but its a close game.
B00BWJ6JO4|5.0|My husband and I really enjoyed The Hobbit. We've read the book and know that there are some (okay, a lot) of things in the movie that are not present in the book, but it was still simply a very enjoyable movie and none of the additions took away from the plot or characters-- some rather complimented it I think. Excited to see the next installment.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It was my daughter's first request for games. She and my nephews are having a blast. Doesn't seem to have any problems.  IDK

B00C9V5JOU|1.0|This lame movie was on NETFLIX and then it was removed!!! I started watching it when it was on NETFLIX and about thirty minutes in I stopped like most everyone else.  Crappy movie and as you can see- ratings are not that great. Don't be fooled.  This movie is best suited for one of the many crappy cable channels or FOX TV. Hard to believe it showed up here as a pre-sale for 17.00.  REALLY?
B0037VNX44|1.0|Wonderful, wonderful acting; thought the premise was interesting.  Clear to me after watching for thirty minutes that this man's life would have been 100x better if he had access to the psychiatric drugs available today.  The film appears to celebrate this man's mental illness and treat his actions as comic.  I work with the mentally ill and will agree that some of the things I witness on a daily basis are funny.  I never saw anyone (SPOILER ALERT!) kill another individual.  Where is the joke?
B00005R24K|5.0|Just a great movie. With gory shock-moments and over the top demons, for sure the movie looks a little cheap but that's ok, the budget for the movie was 360.000 $. This movie is worth the money.<br /><br />Strongly recommended
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|this app is so awesome! I enjoy battling all kinds of enemies and villains! I also like the armor that I can unlock! I enjoy saving the world as iron man! since the movie is already out, I can enjoy this app even more! I'm glad I got this app for free! keep up the good work!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|I found this book very good and realistic (apart from the magic of course) due to the fact that anyone can die at any moment throughout the book. It is thrilling and a good read. I think that it is rather bloody but it depicts very well medieval times. Overall, I believe this book was well written and I am looking forward to reading the next books. I recommend this book for a mature audience.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|The story of Lark Rise to Candleford is told from the view of 16 year old Laura Timmons (think Little House on the Prairie UK style).<br /><br />Laura is the eldest of several Timmons children who is sent from her over-crowded home in the working class hamlet of Lark Rise to the up and coming town of Candleford.  There she lives and works with Dorcas Lane the local postmaster, and there's no better venue for meeting the locals than the post office.<br /><br />The characters in this story are both poignant, quirky and some even unforgettable.  There's Twister, an old man who claims his rheumatism flares up every time his wife Queenie asks him to go earn some money; the Pratt sisters (Ruby & Pearl) who own the local boutique and if they weren't so comical they'd be scary; and there's the pregnant Caroline who gets sent to jail for buying (and drinking) a barrel of beer that she couldn't pay for.<br /><br />The characters unfold and you realize there's so much more than what you see on the surface - just like in real life.<br /><br />Interesting, funny, sometimes predictable, but always, always entertaining.
087033039X|5.0|This how to book on braiding is very well illustrated.  I hope to be able to progress to the more advanced braids soon.

B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I your this as a FAOTD and I love it.  I originally uploaded it for my granddaughter but have been playing it myself..  lots of fun decorating the reef and watching the different fish swim.  I think everyone would enjoy it.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|This game was so much fun that I decided to purchase pearls, which you need in order to attract all the fish in the game.  My reef was so beautiful.  I was collecting sand dollars and algea when the tally stopped totalling everything up.  so, I did what I always do when an app has issues, I uninstalled it and reinstalled it.  It started out as a brand new game.  I not only lost all the work I put in, but also the money I spent on pearls!  I'm not happy about it.  Don't spend money on pearls because if the game freezes you will lose everything.
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|Loved it. The ending with Robert Duvall as a gun range owner reluctantly roped into helping a maiden in distress makes it well worth the price of the movie, even to all those crybabies who say it's not like the book. They are right about that--the movie and its characters are better than anything in the novel.
B00BMKDTNC|5.0|I was worried the last book in the series wouldn't be as good as I had hoped, it was better.<br />It's an excellent read.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|Everything looks vivid and lifelike with this new remaster. One prime example that I never noticed with the old master is when Kyle Reese lands in the alley from Time Traveling all the details in the sweat and bloody scars on his back from his trip come to life with this new master. This is the best the movie has looked in years and my sincere thanks to the director for making this remaster reference material for all the hardcore fans.

1451668945|5.0|Sometimes authors plots and characters get weak the more books they write, but this newest one by Mary Higgins Clark is solid.  The picture on the cover has nothing to do with the story.
B002OFWG7E|5.0|It's the Foo Fighters!  All good songs.  I've always liked them.  My wife and I came across a documentary of them, just as it was starting on TV.  I commented on how much I liked their music.  She asked, &#34;Who are the Foo Fighters?&#34;  I said they did a bunch of songs, and tried to sing (in my non-great renditions) a few lines, from a few songs.  She thought she might recognize them.  I told her that she would recognize a bunch of the songs if we watched the show.  She agreed, so we did.  It was an excellent documentary, from before Nirvana, all the way to present.  By the end of it, she was stoked, and wanted to get some of their music.  I bought this for her, as a gift, since it had so many of the songs they are known for.  A great collection.  Thanks, Dave Grohl, and crew, for so many great songs over the years!
B00BN3DPQ4|3.0|He's baaaaaaaaaaack!!!  Arnold Schwarzenegger returns with his first starring role film in 10 long years.  However, during that ten year span, Arnold did make several cameo appearances in various films, all while running the state of California as governor.  Since leaving office in 2011, he's had a rough couple of years in his personal life.  But, like many celebrities, he used the publicity to his advantage and now continues on with his career.  With his career in politics over, Arnold is jumping back on to the big screen, starting with the action-packed film, The Last Stand.<br /><br />In The Last Stand, Arnold stars as Sheriff Ray Owens, a small town sheriff trying to catch an escaped Mexican drug kingpin, Gabriel Cortez (Eduardo Noriega).  Owens, assisted by his deputies, Frank (Rodrigo Santoro), Jerry (Zach Gilford), and Sarah (Jaimie Alexander) - and their crazy gun-toting friend Lewis (Johnny Knoxville), this small town police force is on a mission to stop this dangerous kingpin from crossing back into Mexico.  Forest Whitaker and Genesis Rodriguez also star in supporting roles as FBI agents.<br /><br />Like so many of Arnold's films, there's very little that stands out about this film.  It is - by all definitions - a violent action film with very little substance or goals other than to shoot a lot of guns and blow things up.  Even though it's nothing new for Arnold, it's great to see him back in the saddle.  Granted, he's never been the perfect actor, but he's never really strives to be.  He has always brought a certain comedic charm, along with gun shells and explosives, that's still very enjoyable to watch.

B000O8OTNC|5.0|I wanted something light, compact, good quality, and could be used to sharpen more than a flat blade.  This is it.  This little gem fits all those requirements.  It has two sized slots for flat blades, plus a tapered sharpener for serrated blades.  I have two of these that I keep in emergency bags.  If you have knives, you should be able to sharpen them.  If you plan to carry knives long-term, in the field, you should carry something to sharpen them in the field.  I would recommend this item for that purpose.  If it were a brighter color, to help locate if dropped, is the only improvement I could possibly see at this time.  Good product.
B00947N6UG|4.0|Since when are Santa Claus, the Easter Bunny, and the Tooth Fairy superheroes?  As children, it's not like the majority of us put Batman, Spider-Man and the Tooth Fairy in the same conversation - but, who needs Captain America and the rest of The Avengers when Jack Frost and The Sandman are watching over you?  As it turns out, novelist William Joyce believes folklore characters from our childhood would make for interesting superheroes.  His popular book series, The Guardians of Childhood, are the basis for the 2012 DreamWorks Animation film, Rise of the Guardians - which turn Santa, the Tooth Fairy, the Easter Bunny, and the Sandman, into heroes.  Not only does Santa and the rest of their characters bring children presents on the holidays, they are also collectively members of a super group that protects children (good or bad) - known as, \\"The Guardians.\\"<br /><br />Adapted to screen by David Lindsay-Abaire (Robots) and directed by Peter Ramsey (Monsters vs. Aliens: Mutant Pumpkins from Outer Space), Rise of the Guardians stars Jack Frost (Chris Pine), a super-powered young man (but at least 300 years old) with the ability to control the winter elements - including snow and ice.  Struggling to remember the person he was prior to becoming Jack Frost, he is reluctant to become a new member of \\"The Guardians,\\" a group that protects children.  The Guardians, led by Nicholas St. North, aka Santa Claus (Alec Baldwin), are alerted that the Boogeyman (Jude Law) has returned to fill children with fear.  Along with Santa, the rest of the Guardians - E. Aster Bunnymund, aka the Easter Bunny (Hugh Jackman), the Tooth Fairy (Isla Fisher) and the voiceless Sandman, aka Sandy - take on the task of convincing Jack Frost that he must become a member of The Guardians to help them stop the Boogeyman before he makes the world's children forget about all of them and force them to live in fear, forever.<br /><br />The Rise of the Guardians plot features the typical good vs. evil conundrum, with colorful characters and a slew of laugh-out-loud moments.  These characters stay true to their reputations and are wonderfully written and charming.  Alec Baldwin is the most notable in the voice acting department since he does such a stunning job of disguising his voice for the role of Santa Claus.  Hugh Jackman is clearly recognizable (and the rabbit/kangaroo references are quite funny), as is Jude Law in his role as the villain, the Boogyman - a dark and dastardly `avatar' look-a-like.  The third tier supporting characters are quiet, yet effective - which include a large group of tooth fairies, elves, walking eggs, and wookie-looking creatures.  As it turns out, the elves are relatively useless in Santa's workshop, with the majority of the work being done by these Chewbacca-like wookies (that also speak in a similar manner as a wookie).<br /><br />In principle, this film feels like the animated holiday version of Marvel's The Avengers.  Santa is the leader, and it takes a major super villain to bring the entire team together in order to fight for the same cause:  protecting the world's children.  Aside from the plot, this film is simply one more film, like Toy Story or any other children's film that centers around one specific character, where the main character is inevitably surrounded by a wide-range of supporting characters with very different personalities.  However, in the case of The Guardians, you really couldn't find a group of characters with less in common (different jobs) and more in common (children) all at the same time - which is the dynamic that makes the premise of this film such a unique idea.<br /><br />It's difficult to find any outstanding issues with Rise of the Guardians and overall, it's a very well-rounded film.  Not only does this film feature a majority of the beloved holiday characters - it's a film that everyone can easily enjoy.  The film makes for a comforting trip down memory lane - a trip that the whole family should sit down and enjoy together.  There's a bit of humor, a handful of action scenes, and some of the most recognizable names in Hollywood doing the voice work - all collectively creating a memorable movie experience.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  B<br />FNDNreview.comwn and enjoy together.

B005LAIIKI|5.0|Quentin Tarantino is a revolutionary filmmaker that has completely changed the landscape of writing and directing in Hollywood.  For the most part, that statement is probably true, but at the same time, it's very difficult to prove that statement to be false.  For better or worse, Tarantino has created a unique style of Hollywood film.  Still, when we think revolutionary figures in Hollywood, we think Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Wells, Stanley Kubrick, and Steven Spielberg.  But, does Tarantino belong on that list, and if he does, should he be one of the people at the top of that list?  These questions are a debatable topic, that's for sure.  However, if he keeps making films equal to or better than Django Unchained, he could cement himself as the greatest filmmaker of all-time.<br /><br />Taking places two years prior to the American Civil War in Texas, Django Unchained stars Jamie Foxx as Django Freeman, a freed slave turned bounty hunter searching for his enslaved wife, Broomhilda (Kerry Washington).  Django and his partner, Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz), locate Broomhilda on a plantation called Candyland and attempt to free her from the ownership of Calvin J. Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), a wealthy slave owner.  Samuel L. Jackson, Walton Goggins, and Don Johnson also star in supporting roles to round out the cast.<br /><br />True enough, Jamie Foxx is in the leading man in Django Unchained, but Christoph Waltz and Leonardo DiCaprio quickly steal the show with their roles.  Foxx plays the role of slave turned killer well, but being the overbearing gunslinger character that it is - it's far from a memorable role or his best acting performance.  Waltz, on the other hand, has never been better, as he once again plays a charming, yet deadly German character reminiscent of the Nazi officer Hans Landa in Inglorious Basterds, Tarantino's previous film.  DiCaprio also stands out in his role as slave owner Calvin Candie, with the only drawback being DiCaprio doesn't appear until nearly an hour into the film.  Waltz and DiCaprio both portray cleverly quick-tongued characters that are equally loveable and hate-able in their respective roles.<br /><br />As for the topic of slavery - it wouldn't be a Tarantino film without controversial subject matter.  This film depicts obvious racism throughout in the spirit of being true to the time period.  The depiction of slave whipping and torturous acts are difficult to view at times, but Tarantino brings these travesties to light just enough to embed the merciless degradation by slave owners into the eyes of the audience.  And, once again, it wouldn't be a Tarantino film without some gore to go along with the shootout scenes.<br /><br />Overall, this film is an entertainment-filled joyride through a troubling period in American history.  Regardless, this film is overly charming with a variety of memorable moments for audiences to enjoy.  History, comedy, action, drama, and beautiful scenery all contribute to make this film a no-brainer, must-see film.  And, while rarely ever mentioned in these reviews, Django Unchained also contains an ear-pleasing soundtrack that fits perfectly with the film.  Tarantino has truly created a work of art that will be appreciated for many years to come.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  A<br />FNDNreview.comuntil nearly an hour into the film.

B005LAII80|3.0|Transferring a comic book character to the big screen can pretty tricky business if the right people aren't at the helm.  If the script doesn't get the tone of the character right, it doesn't matter who the director or actors are in the film, because it's doomed to fail.  For example, Green Lantern (2011) was always doomed to fail.  It didn't matter if Ryan Reynolds sucked as Hal Jordan or not (and he did) because the script didn't do the character justice.  In 2012, Judge Dredd returned to the big screen in Dredd, which was recently released on DVD/Blu-ray, and it's perfectly evident that screenwriter Alex Garland didn't do this comic book character any favors, either.<br /><br />Before we get to the review of Dredd, let's do a quick review and background check on this character, known as Judge Dredd.  For those that don't remember or didn't bother to watch Sylvester Stallone's portrayal of Judge Dredd in Judge Dredd (1995), this character is a masked (helmet) street judge in Mega-City One, a variation of a New York City-like urban area after it has been devastated by a Soviet nuclear attack.  Judge Joseph Dredd is a famous/notorious street cop (known as a judge) that patrols the streets and serves as judge, jury, and executioner after apprehending a criminal.  He carries a multi-function gun, known as a \\"lawgiver,\\" and patrols the city on a motorcycle, called a \\"lawmaster.\\"  He is a ruthlessly affective officer, unbending with his judgments, and incorruptible.<br /><br />In Dredd (2012), Judge Dredd (Karl Urban) is given the task of evaluating a rookie judge in training, Cassandra Anderson (Olivia Thirlby).  Anderson, a powerful \\"mutant\\" psychic, must pass a final test and assist Dredd in the investigation of a new drug, \\"Slo-Mo,\\" which severely hampers a user's concept of time.  Responding to a building after a drug-related murder, they apprehend a drug thug for questioning.  Dredd and Anderson identify Ma-Ma (Lena Headey), a drug lord, as the one responsible for the spread of \\"Slo-Mo.\\"  And, while attempting to bring the drug thug suspect in for questioning, Ma-Ma traps Dredd and Anderson in the building, ordering their deaths.  Cue the action scenes.<br /><br />Unlike the 1995 rendition of Judge Dredd, this new version of Dredd doesn't delve into the past of the Dredd character, or even the Dredd universe.  This 2012 rendition feels more like a sequel than it does the first film in a reboot series.  That's not to say Dredd is a horrible film, but you have to question the thought process of making this film prior to bringing it to the big screen.  Aside from a short monologue at the beginning of the film or unless viewers have read the comics and/or saw the Stallone film version, viewers will be scratching their heads asking themselves if they missed something.  Had the creators made an origin story explaining the characters, explaining the destruction of the city, and the unique politics of this wasteland government, then Dredd would have served its purpose as a very healthy sequel.  Instead, this film creates more disappointment than excitement.<br /><br />For the moment, let's put those questions aside and move on to the film as it currently stands.  Karl Urban brings the cold, calculating Dredd to life in ways that Stallone never did.  Urban is far less comical than Stallone, while Urban's portrayal is far more bold and serious, which is more like the comic book character and less like what viewers were treated to in 1995.  Since Dredd's face is never seen on screen (only true to the comic book), you may never know it's Karl Urban under the helmet - unless you're able to identify people by their chin.  As far as the supporting cast goes, Olivia Thirlby and Lena Headey leave a great deal to be desired.  Going back to the earlier point - there's very little actors/actresses can do with a weakly written script.  This is obviously not a dialogue heavy film, as it focuses much more on the action aspect with constant gunfireand relentless explosions.<br /><br />Overall, Judge Dredd is little-know character that was given a misguided return to the big screen.  There's plenty of action to go around in this film, so that's a plus for action junkies.  However, other than that, this film contains unmemorable acting, a clumsy plot, and to make matters even worse - since the film was shot in 3D, there's an abundance of overused, slow-motion drug scenes that are extremely tedious and unnecessary.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  C+<br />FNDNreview.comand relentless explosions.<br /><br />Overall, Judge Dredd is little-know character that was given a misguided return to the big screen.

B00CL0J99K|3.0|Since the conclusion of Marvel's The Avengers last summer, everyone has been begging for details about how the 2012 juggernaut will impact Iron Man III.  The list of questions has been endless, but the biggest question (outside of plot points) is 'can Iron Man III live up to the worldwide success of The Avengers?'  The fact is The Avengers is the biggest summer blockbuster of all-time.  It sits at number three on the list of the top-grossing films of all-time.  So, how do you follow that kind of success?  The easiest way to answer that question is to just admit that it's silly to think any film will ever top The Avengers in terms of success - at least any other comic book film, that is.  We saw The Dark Knight Rises fall in the aftermath of The Avengers, so if Chris Nolan's Batman couldn't surpass the success of The Avengers, how can another Iron Man sequel can do it?  The answer to that question is: momentum.  Simply put, the interest created by The Avengers will most likely thrust Iron Man III to heights most people couldn't possibly imagine.  Regardless, this is just speculation and it's far too early to tell how Iron Man III will play out at the box office, but in terms of the overall quality of the film - well, we have that answer for you.<br /><br />Directed by Shane Black (Kiss Kiss Bang Bang), Iron Man III stars Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man.  In the wake of the events that took place during the invasion of New York, Tony Stark has not been able to sleep and frequently experiences panic attacks.  Waiting for the next big attack to strike, Stark has been in his basement building an army of Iron Men, all the while a terrorist leader, The Mandarin (Ben Kinsley), has been strategically setting off bombs all over the United States.  One of these bombs catches Stark's old body guard and new Stark Industries' chief of security, Happy Hogan, in the crossfire - which quickly gains Stark's attention.  At the same time, Aldrich Killian (Guy Pearch) has made his presence known, using an \\"explosive\\" new state of the art rehabilitation program, known as Extremis.  Suddenly, Stark finds himself trapped in the evil web of The Mandarin, along with the impact of the Extremis program, not to mention struggling to protect the people he cares about most.  Gwyneth Paltrow, Don Cheadle, Rebecca Hall, and Jon Favreau also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />Coming as no surprise, Iron Man III's screen time belongs largely to Robert Downey Jr.  Obviously, Downey Jr. continues with the character he's made famous and doesn't miss a beat with his usual wit and charm.  Don Cheadle and Gwyneth Paltrow both play their usual supporting roles as (respectively) the armored sidekick War Machine (now called The Iron Patriot) and the damsel in distress.  The best part of comic book films is that they're always chalked full of goodies, including character additions.  Iron Man III sees the addition of Iron Man's arch-nemesis, The Mandarin, played by Sir Ben Kinsley - who is nothing short of a treat in this film.  They honestly couldn't have picked a better actor to portray this villain (there's a huge swerve involving this character).  Finally, like Jeff Bridges, Mickey Rourke, and Sam Rockwell in the previous Iron Man films, Guy Pearce fills the role of the jealous scientist, desperate to destroy Tony Stark - just because he's smarter than everyone else.  Sadly, Pearce is probably the least interesting villain in the franchise.<br /><br />Now - here's the good, the bad, and the ugly.  First and foremost, Iron Man III is a comic book lover's delight.  If you were a fan of the Extremis storyline in the comics, you'll absolutely adore what these filmmakers have done with this movie adaption.  The bad news is for the film lovers of The Avengers.  If you thought Iron Man III would be full of cameos from Samuel L. Jackson, Chris Evans, or Chris Hemsworth - you'll be very disappointed.  Without specifically spoiling anything, you will get to see at least one member of The Avengers (briefly) make an appearance.  And, the ugly has to begin with an apology.  Sorry, kids - there's no Ant-Man debut, no reference to the next Thor film, and definitely nothing to do with the mysterious Guardians of the Galaxy.  This film is completely centered on Tony Stark and the rest of the Iron Man characters.<br /><br />Generally speaking, the plot isn't all that it's been talked up to be.  Yes, the film is full of action, and this particular sequel is Tony Stark's version of The Empire Strikes Back.  He gets an ass-kicking in this film that just keeps on giving.  However, for anyone to even compare The Avengers to Iron Man III is completely and utterly delusional about the quality and scale of these two comic book films.  For the average movie-goer, Iron Man III is on par with its predecessors, but the first Iron Man film is still the best in this trilogy.  Iron Man II has the best villains, Iron Man has the best plot, and Iron Man III is just a combination of the first two films.  Disapprovingly, the landscape of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is relatively unchanged after this film, meaning - in the grand scheme of things - Iron Man III is a bit of a letdown.  There's not much of cliffhanger and nothing overly exciting going on to lead into the next Phase II film.  Sure, it's an enjoyable, entertaining fill - but this critic can't help but want more.<br /><br />Overall, Iron Man III is an average addition to the Marvel film library, but it doesn't even come close to the quality of The Avengers.  Unfortunately, the plot lacks meaningful progression for the future of the Iron Man characters (other than Pepper Potts) - yet if you're just simply looking at Iron Man III as a solo story and means of entertainment, it will be difficult to find a better action film in the summer of 2013.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade: C+<br />FNDNreview.comast one member of The Avengers (briefly) make an appearance.

I was extremely excited to read the material presented in this book because it depicted scenarios that I face daily in my job as a Program Manager dealing with customers and development teams. Like someone said on another review, there may not be much new stuff on the book but the material is presented in a way that makes perfect sense to the reader, specially those who have had similar challenges. The book contains a number of examples and real life scenarios that highlight solutions to common problems and self inflicted dilemmas. I have learned a lot from this book. I  have share a lot of it on twitter @DavidParra and I have used the principles learned on several conversations at work and in other settings.  I am looking forward to improving the way I do certain things and I have asked several in my teams to grab a copy of this book and read it. I think that if those involved in my team get on the same page we will accomplish more than we are doing right now. Definitely 5 stars to this book. I would read it again in a heartbeat and perhaps I will in a few weeks.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|Before the current wave of superhero comic book films, like Marvel's Avengers and The Dark Knight series, comic book franchises had really been a hit or miss endeavor - so much so that most directors wanted nothing to do with them.  Richard Donner started a whole new trend of comic book films with Superman and it went from there.  Filmmakers set out to make superhero films because they dared not just to make a great film for comic book fans - but also films that they thought everyone would go see.  After the Superman films fizzled out in the 80s, filmmakers turned to other characters in the 90s, like the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Batman.  However, one particular film from that mid-90s era is completely overlooked and doesn't typically appear on most fans' Top 10 comic book film lists:  The Crow.<br /><br />Created by James O'Barr and adapted to film in 1994, The Crow tells the story of Eric Draven and his fianc&eacute;e, Sarah, a couple brutally beaten and murdered by a local gang.  One year after his death, Eric returns from the dead, with immunity to physical harm, to take revenge upon the gang members responsible for the death of him and his former bride-to-be.<br /><br />The Crow is a standalone story revolving around the brutal death of a couple - who are literally a day away from being married.  It's heartbreaking and tragic, but at the same time, it's action-packed, anti-hero entertainment by a characterl that wanted nothing more than to be happily married, even though the world around him was already in despair.  The Crow is a difficult story about love and vengeance.  With that being said, it is entirely possible audiences weren't entirely ready for this character.<br /><br />By 1994, audiences were already introduced to Tim Burton's darker rendition of the Dark Knight, and a more realistic - and again dark - version of the Ninja Turtles.  Keeping with that same dark and dreary theme, The Crow still struggled to match-up (box office-wise) to these mirrored versions of Batman and the Turtles.  Was it because people didn't know The Crow?  It's possible.  However, unlike the loveable turtles or the caped crusader, The Crow is a visually hard to digest story and at times, is a very depressing story.<br /><br />Regardless of the box office outcome (which is still considered to be a success), Brandon Lee, the late son of the legendary Bruce Lee, gave one of the greatest comic book performances to this day.  If you think Heath Ledger was the first person to make crazy look cool, then you're encouraged to take another look at Brandon Lee's performance in The Crow.  Unfortunately, Lee's accidental death during the shooting of the film cast a dark cloud over this film.  Knowing that Lee dies during one of the scenes in the film makes it hard enough to watch the film without taking the story into account, and his death alone could very well be one of the biggest reason's that The Crow  has become a long forgotten gem in a genre full of duds.<br /><br />Overall Film Grade:  A<br />FNDNreview.comversions of Batman and the Turtles.

B008220BP2|4.0|The zombies are coming!  The zombies are coming!  Yeah, it's a cheap way to start a review, so if you decided to leave - it's understandable and you're forgiven (not really).  Never the less, zombie-mania is running rampant on television, the big screen, video games, novels, etc. - so much so that it would appear (for now, at least) that zombies have permanently embedded themselves on our media entertainment...and have no intentions of leaving us alone any time soon.  Now, there's not enough time in the day to recap the occasionally dull, often predictable history of the \\"zombie\\" or the massive amount of renditions they've portrayed over the years.  However, without their leg-dragging history, they wouldn't be enjoying their fruitful present - in the form of a number one movie at the box:  Warm Bodies.<br /><br />Like any previous flick with \\"dead\\" in the title or named Resident Evil, zombies always play the bad guys.  They eat brains and flesh, and are one of Hollywood's greatest villains of all-time.  However, Warm Bodies shows us another side of the zombie psyche - the active-minded protagonist.  Based on Issac Marion's novel of the same name, the film stars Nicholas Hoult as R, a youthful zombie living in a post-apocalyptic city.  As most zombies do, he spends his days slowly wondering about looking for flesh - when one day he and his friends stumble upon a group of humans gathering supplies.  Among the humans is Julie (Teresa Palmer), and it's love at first sight for R.  The problem is he's still a zombie and she's a human - not to mention the daughter of the anti-zombie movement's leader (John Malkovich).  Rob Corddry and Analeigh Tipton also star in supporting roles.<br /><br />For a character having only a few lines to utter, Nicholas Hoult manages to work his eyes and body movements in a way that allows him to stay true to the motions of a typical zombie.  His co-star love interest, Teresa Palmer - dubbed a Kristin Stewart look-a-like, dominates the majority of the dialogue and will make you wish it were her playing the lead in the Twilight films instead of Stewart.  Together, Hoult and Palmer are engaging and memorable due largely to Jonathan Levine's writing and directing.  His character's are thoughtful and witty, while his directing ability is undoubtedly effective.  He manages to keep the flow of entertainment perfectly balanced and there's very little doubt he has a future cult-classic on his hands.<br /><br />If you happen to get a brief look at this film - whether it's from a trailer, TV spot, or other clip - this film comes off as a pretty hokey idea.  However, the rule of \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\" absolutely applies to this film.  If there's one word to describe this film, it's plain and simply ENJOYABLE.  Zombie films aren't for everyone, but this film really does have a little something for everyone.  For the most part, it's family-friendly with the core of the story focusing on the unconventional love story between a human and a zombie - playing off a Beauty and the Beast style of fairy tale.  A new breed of zombies serves as the villain in this film, making for some action and suspense.  And, there's plenty of lighthearted comedy to keep you laughing.<br /><br />To be honest, it's about time something new was done in the world of zombies.  These days, too much of the zombie entertainment looks and feels like Resident Evil or The Walking Dead.  Easily one of the best zombie encounters in recent memory, Warm Bodies will remind you of the charm and wit in Shaun of the Dead, while still maintaining those core principles of brain-eating and lousy make-up.  Regardless, if you're on the fence about seeing this film, consider this the push you've been waiting for to go see it.

Together, Hoult and Palmer are engaging and memorable due largely to Jonathan Levine's writing and directing.  His character's are thoughtful and witty, while his directing ability is undoubtedly effective.  He manages to keep the flow of entertainment perfectly balanced and there's very little doubt he has a future cult-classic on his hands.<br /><br />If you happen to get a brief look at this film - whether it's from a trailer, TV spot, or other clip - this film comes off as a pretty hokey idea.  However, the rule of \\"don't judge a book by its cover\\" absolutely applies to this film.  If there's one word to describe this film, it's plain and simply ENJOYABLE.  Zombie films aren't for everyone, but this film really does have a little something for everyone.  For the most part, it's family-friendly with the core of the story focusing on the unconventional love story between a human and a zombie - playing off a Beauty and the Beast style of fairy tale.  A new breed of zombies serves as the villain in this film, making for some action and suspense.  And, there's plenty of lighthearted comedy to keep you laughing.<br /><br />To be honest, it's about time something new was done in the world of zombies.  These days, too much of the zombie entertainment looks and feels like Resident Evil or The Walking Dead.  Easily one of the best zombie encounters in recent memory, Warm Bodies will remind you of the charm and wit in Shaun of the Dead, while still maintaining those core principles of brain-eating and lousy make-up.  Regardless, if you're on the fence about seeing this film, consider this the push you've been waiting for to go see it.  Don't be a zombie - starting running to your local ticket window now.<br /><br />Overall Grade:  B<br />FNDNreview.com
B002OR18HQ|5.0|I definitely give John Fogerty's Comin' Down the Road: The Concert at Albert Hall DVD a 5 rating because I absolutely love it.  It is a triumphant return to a place of one of john's greatest and best-received performances as lead singer for CCR when they were at the height of their career.  Those years in between were troubled years with record-label lawsuits and betrayals of all kinds, but he persevered and came back full force, and you can hear his happiness and excitement in his voice.  I recommend this DVD to people of all generations in all walks of life. The young and the old will enjoy his wonderful songs!  John Fogerty is The Man!
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I really liked this game. Interesting. I look forward to more rooms. I'd definitely recommend it to friends and family
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think we should have a power up that lets you go through trains without getting chought by the inspector that would be amazing I love this game
B0000VCZKW|5.0|Matida is one of the best and enjoyable comedy's made. Acting and story line done very well, and kept me laughing for hours.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|I really love this great animal game and all the great features in it. So I think you should have more game like this.

B00A7OJ0DC|4.0|Great fun and stuff. Makes you laugh. Makes you cry. Makes you want to fight for the 'little' guy, if you know what I mean (?)
B00BHHIWQO|4.0|I do like this game and played it a lot then all of a sudden it stopped working and I couldn't get it back and ended up just deleting it.  I don't know what happened, but I'll try to download it again and see what happens.
B009AMANH4|5.0|It was like going back in time. Daniel Day-Lewis WAS President Lincoln.<br />There was only a little action, but what there was, was not over-done for the sake of dramatic affect, making it more real.<br />The movie's portrayal of the prejudicial attitudes of the time were so astoundingly shocking they couldn't be true, could they?
B00797MB0O|1.0|Though Charlize Theron is always a great actor, the screen play for this depressing movie is what's at fault. If I wanted to reminisce  about sad adults who never full-filled their dreams, I would pull out my high school yearbook instead.
B00846REIS|5.0|I can see why so many readers have enjoyed this just as much as 5o shades, I certainly did. Ready to read the next book.
B001BWQVSG|5.0|Dangerous because as I'm listening to her performance of the Brahms Rhapsody #2 I'm noticing that I'm holding my breath.  I'm transported into this place where I somehow forget that I live inside a human body, and am supposed to breath.  Ok...  exhale!<br /><br />After exhaling, I logged in to amazon and wrote this observation (herein).<br /><br />And as I write, she continues playing the Brahms so beautifully I could cry.  This is a fantastic collection, and an incredible value.  Do yourself a favor.  Buy it.  But do remind yourself to breath.
B008XG1X18|5.0|pinterest is so much fun. I have found so many good ideas. I can't wait to try them. the only problem is I spend too much time looking at new pins.
B00AS1Q8FW|4.0|this review is on the blu ray disc of the movie as follows-<br />movie - 3.5 / 5<br />video - 4.5 / 5<br />audio - 4.5 / 5<br /><br />blu ray had good video and audio on an overall disappointing movie.<br />a rental at best.
B0029LCJJS|5.0|Great season. Loved watching and learning about this period in history. Henry was quite the character. Interesting to learn about the history of his first wife Catherine of Aragon. Definitely recommend!
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|This app is great because it has plants that mature quickly and you don't have to worry about running out of energy. The graphics are really good and so far there are plenty of tasks to keep me busy.
B006OAB2XO|5.0|This album mixes pleasant, spacey, poppy instrumentation with an extremely unique instrument-- Grimes' voice-- to make an experience that will have you simultaneously thinking, \\"What on earth am I listening to?\\" and, \\"How do I get more of it?\\"  It is an extremely interesting and increasingly satisfying listen.  It is the perfect album to get lost in.<br /><br />You may also accidentally fall in love with her, because her singing is just adorable at times.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I bought this game when it came because it looked like a really cool game to play to pass time in the car or when I got bored. So I started playing and immediately became addicted to this game. I play it all the time!! I mean All the time. The really funny part is is I was playing this game at my grandmas and my little cousin was there and she is three and she wanted to try so I let her try and boa she is better than me she play it and watch Tv at the same time! I just want to say Kiloo... THANK YOU FOR AN AMAZING GAME!!! AND I LOOOOOOOOOVE TTHE UPDATES!!!!!!!
B001KT6JPA|5.0|I have seen this movie many times and still enjoy, not sure if that is the correct word to use for this!, but it is so well acted and the story line is great!
0670024813|5.0|Jared Diamond's argument, there exist unsuitable things to the distinctive feature of human beings in our Weird (Western educated, industrialized, rich and democratic) societies, is clear and quite to the point. He says many small-scale societies possess some features that we could profitably incorporate into our state societies. What and how we left behind in the process of civilization.<br /><br />New Guinean's remarks that they don't just go and visit someone without a purpose make me think of their harsh reality. We easily think we've acquired a relationship or friendship with someone we've just met and spent days with. This is most unlikely in the society where peace and safety is not fully assured. Blunting sensibility to danger may make us exposed in peril easily. Diamond alleges genes relate to the two big issues of adult diseases, hypertension and Type-2 diabetes, must have been advantageous to us under conditions of traditional lifestyles, but that have become lethal under conditions of the Westernized lifestyle.<br /><br />Bodily punishment and bullying at school become the greatest problems in Japan. Most hunter-gatherer bands do minimal physical punishment of young children, Diamond says, while many farming societies do some punishment, and herders are especially likely to punish. It is said to be rare for hunter-gatherer games to keep score or identify a winner, whereas many Western games involve keeping score and are about winning and losing.<br /><br />Bilingualism, common in the traditional societies, has advantages in solving problems in the constantly changing world with confusing information. He asserts bilingualism itself protects against Alzheimer's symptom. Modern industrial societies hasn't developed superior approaches to problems we face now. We could find some useful ideas from the huge range of traditional human experience.
1582406723|5.0|great book and i cant wait to re-read it because it has the most amazing story ever told which is so epic!
B008TRUDAS|3.0|Maybe it is my own fault - I read Hopeless first & feel in love. Slammed on the other hand is incredibly weak in comparison, way more YA. Will is a teacher who lost his parents and is raising his brother. Lake moves in across the street, an 18 year old who father recently passed away. After the most amazing first date in history Will is broken hearted to find out he is Lake's teacher and cannot have a relationship with her. This book shouldn't be listed on any of the Fifty Shades comparisons since Slammed doesn't have much angst or drama or sadly any heat. And definitely, absolutely no sex, even though Lake is 18 years old, she is a high school senior. A great deal of tragedy happens in the story pulling Will & Lake apart, then back together, constantly.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is simply amazing.  I can't believe how good the graphics are and how smooth it plays on my kindle fire HD.  I don't typically spend real money on in-game purchases - I prefer to pay one up-front price and then not be bothered however this game is so much fun I found myself rationalizing the cost to make some in-game purchases.  It's a donation to the great team that built this game, right?  Seriously though, you will enjoy this game immensely whether you play it for free or not.  So far I have found it has a lot of depth and is very similar to the classic Diablo games but better graphics.  Try it.  You won't be disappointed.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love all ur bongo games but run out of chips too soon so I will go to another one and another until all chips r gone.
B004SCN2F6|5.0|Well I  read the reviews and got the app, now my life is not my own. l am a Star Trader,  when Im not playing I can't wait to get back to my stars and the Ship that is all mine. Great app ... love it.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I'm home for a few weeks recovering from surgery and a friend suggested I give the show a try...I watches all 4 seasons in less than 3 weeks:). As all well ritten shows, this one has you asking for more, the acting is great and Marguiles plays a fabulous ice queen with a heart!
B000056H24|1.0|I didn't realize this was such a badly done movie.  I'm very disappointed.  It also often deviates from scripture, too.
B009GED3HS|5.0|This is such a great show. I know two types of people, those who hate it and those who love it. Since my husband and I lived in New York it is very easy to identify yourself with the characters. We have watched and re watched the seasons because they never get old.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|The book (The Hobbit), as written by Tolkien, was a fairly simple children's story.  The later Lord of the Rings series was much more complex and had a darker feel.  This movie did a good job of adapting the Hobbit to make it more like the Lord of Rings series, both by filling in the storyline and altering the tone of the story.  Purists may not be happy with the liberties taken with the Hobbit story, but I think moviegoers needed this adaptation to meet their expectations and to maintain consistency with the three prior Lord of the Rings movies.
B009JZWO3I|5.0|As all the other seasons, this one is also great. Some episodes are just ok, but overhall is a great ahlw.
B0035LMTZA|5.0|This is an excellent re-make of the original Italian Job.<br />Superb job with the special effects and the twist of the plot, which deffers from the original giving the film much more action.
B006RXPTNM|5.0|I almost never watch a film twice but I had to for a class I'm taking.  I'm glad I did.  On my second viewing I realized what a great film this really is.  Full of subtlety and nuance.  The characters are perfectly cast.  It truly leaves you &#34;in doubt&#34;  If it doesn't you need to question your own judgment.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I enjoy the story line and my three year old enjoys learning about the coral reef and he asks questions about the corals and coral fish that swim around. And it is beautiful graphics, so what more could you ask for right? :)
B00CHSPB8Y|1.0|I downloaded it because I love Iron Man and the Gameloft games are pretty good. But when it had to do the stupid extra download I got of a lot if great apps just to free up enough space. And when I had enough space I opened it up and it said, \\"You do not have enough free memory card space. You need 356 Mb. of free space.\\" I have 452 mb. of free space you idiot! This was a waste of my time.
B0034G4OVS|5.0|AWESOME MOVIE, keeps you in suspense almost in the entire movie. Love the suspense, horror, the chilling plot.<br />I have watched this movie, 3 times, I love to buy my movies here on amazon
B006MW3UZW|5.0|watched season a and season 2 in a few days. Then we stayed up one night till 3 am and watched season 3. Excellent funny and sad drama that touches on all aspects of life. Beautifully written and acted, loved Maggie Smith.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|I enjoyed this exciting fast action movie!  It tells a story & is not just a venue for special effects; although I enjoyed them as well.
B008RJFRTK|1.0|This would not work. I was not happy with this. It is not worth buying. It does not work with the Kindle Fire.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I found the beginning to be a little slow, but once the story really started, it did not stop. I loved the twists and turns and the character development was awesome.
1597774987|3.0|Great writing, but a mind-game that is hard to follow when listening. More l'art pour l'art, demanding attention and previous literary knowledge.
0439023513|5.0|I loved the first book, now I'm waiting for the second book to arrive so I can read it and get going with the third one.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|I am able to transfer my pictures from the computer on to my kindle very easily.  I recommend having this USB cable.
