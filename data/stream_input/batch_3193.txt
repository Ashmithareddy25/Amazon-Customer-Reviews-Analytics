0385537131|1.0|this book is far from the usual good read.  It read like Grisham had to meet a deadline and couldn't think of anything new.
1401216676|5.0|It's a fantastic work and glimpse into the minds of both Batman and Joker. Very well done from all involved.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I love a book that I just can not put down. Complex theme\\"s, likable characters.  A great read for all.
B00BATG18K|3.0|In truth, Amy Tan would've been better off naming this book The Valley of Lost Souls. Nearly everyone and everything in it is riding in a leaking boat. The beginning of this book leads you to believe it'll be interesting, an unveiling of something great and important.Instea<br />d, it plods along with moments that make you believe something great will happen and then............oh the usual predictable story.<br /><br />Her protagonist, Violet, is supposed to be this wronged child turned wronged woman who is a survivor and capable of overcoming the difficulties of life via her half Chinese/half American self. Her &#34;American&#34; side is supposedly spirited and full of ingenuity. Instead, her &#34;American&#34; self is ridiculously self pitying, lacking in anything creative and equally lacking in &#34;go to it.&#34; Why we are supposed to believe a child of seven who appears to have spent most of her time in China should remember much English or her &#34;American&#34; self, I don't know. Regardless, it's her Chinese self that tends to save her more often than not by looking life in the eye at the heart of a bad moment.<br /><br />Violet is a damsel in distress. Long, long tiring distress so that we all feel it. Her suitors are tiresome, she's tiresome and her overall life is tiresome.<br /><br />Yes, this book does remind the reader of Memoirs of a Geisha. Ms. Tan, you're talented but take a page out of that book and realize that if you want to create angst, which you do, make your characters want to strive for something over all odds. They need not succeed. It's the trying that grabs us. Give them the fire they need to rise above the banal. We humans don't want to read about the average. Nor do we want mother/daughter issues all the time. That scene has been played long before your stories.
B00FR0GT9Y|1.0|Sadly this album is a far cry from the original album.  There is no depth to the sound, lyrics and singers.  And the fake drums are just the icing on the cake of disappointment.
B000001DTM|5.0|This one of my favorite U2 albulms.  I have not really liked anything after this.  Definitely a classic for all fans.
B00FR0GT9Y|1.0|This just sucks by any standard.  This is a band that put out 2 incredible albums and should have stopped there.
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|Opening scene had full frontal nudity which was not necessary.  We turned the movie off and didn't watch the rest.
B00BT1XCOU|5.0|LOVE HIMYM!!  It's a great show & while I am happy that we are finally getting to find out the answer to the show's title (How I met your mother), I am sad that it will actually end.
0800177177|4.0|Anthony Hopkins gives one of his best performances here, re-interpreting Van Helsing as wise, funny, and fearless, and giddy with delight about finally grappling with his great foe. Hopkins appears about 45 minutes into the film (his voice arrives earlier) and he picks things up noticeably. Winona Ryder is OK but her English accent is so bad it almost seems like a deliberate parody of an English accent - could Ryder and Coppola be trying parody there? Or is Mina (Ryder's character) pretending to be English, in keeping with the film's theme of human culture being out-of-balance? Keanu Reeves has a pretty bad accent too but overall I'm not seeing his performance as the abyss of stiffness that many people describe - I see his stiffness and reserve as deliberate choices. Gary Oldman is good. Sadie Frost is good. Tom Waits is spectacular as Renfield. (Why has no one built a film around that guy? Or, if someone has, how have I managed to overlook it? On the other hand, maybe he's best taken in small intense doses.) The art direction/set direction is superlative, although, I must say, I would like to have seen what Coppola could have done with another million dollars in budget. P.S. - Someone here describes Coppola as \\"wildly overrated.\\" This notion calls for a polite chuckle and the back of one's hand as if swatting away one of the flies beloved by Renfield.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This has great quality packaging, really a nice set for a great price. I would recommend this to anyone looking to buy a gift for a science fiction fan.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|I really enjoy playing this game. The only thing I don't like is waiting for energy. Great graphics and great game to past time.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Their music is simply wonderfull and  beautiful, they give a new turn to classical and contemporary music. I recommend them truly.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|Totally cool. Setting it is easy. It's really bright so you can see the numbers in the dark. You can also set different sounds to wake up too.
B00AFROVQC|2.0|I buy these books because my son (now nine) liked them.  I read them so he and I can talk about them.  He is an avid reader and these were among his first bigger kid books.  He has, as more books come out (Rice churns out a book every two months), begun to pick out glaring inconsistencies in the books and make fun of the one-dimensional characters.  He is now reading books with more complex character development, and at nine, he sees the difference between this category of books and the Sorcerer's Ring books, and if you read these books, you will pick up on it much sooner than a nine year old boy. If my son continues reading these books, I will continue buying them and skimming over them, but I in no way enjoy the simplistic writing and silly story.<br /><br />They are a step above the Magic Treehouse books (although I enjoyed the Magic Treehouse books more) but it is a tiny step and I am glad my son is beginning to move away from these simplistic books.  Read them like they were written, quickly and without much thought, and they aren't so bad.  Better yet, read them when you are eight and you will enjoy them.<br /><br />BTW If someone in the Ring invented a gorget, he'd win a Nobel Peace Prize.  Ninety-five percent of the people killed in these books are stabbed in the throat (like I said, unimaginative) and with a gorget, noone would die, and everyone could just get along!
B00DW1WR14|5.0|It's pearl jam. If you're a fan you will like this album. Just let it grow on you like anything else. Heard a few of these songs live first in Chicago. Liked them. Heard them again a few months later. Loved them.
0345535529|5.0|All five in one package should keep you entertained while waiting for the return of the series and before Winds of Winter and A Dream of Spring arrive. Meet me in Westeros at the ruins of Winterfell.
B000C20VPA|5.0|Was in Vegas a few weeks ago and did a tour whee this was referenced often so had to see it.  Thought it was very good.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Especially like playing when I am sitting in a waiting room for whatever, car repair etc. The game can be addicting
B00CL151G4|5.0|I absolutely love watching Elementary - didn't miss a show on TV and enjoy the repeat of the first season on DVD.
B00B2FDF54|4.0|Clint Eastwood continues to do good quality movies. This one shows how sometimes technology isn't answer, sometimes experience and common sense are the best tools.
B00E9A656K|3.0|This game seems to want a lot of money, and I'm never sure when the upgrades I would buy with real money will last beyond the current race.
B006KAWI2C|5.0|(1) Sure, there's 144 CDs there, but some are a mere 30 minutes long (even short for the LP era).  So, sure, it's 75 cents a CD (at the price I paid), but is it all that great of a bargain?  I think so, because the original jackets really are &#34;cute.&#34;<br />(2) I'm playing most of these CDs on a Bose table radio with CD player (&#34;Wave&#34; technology).  On that unit, the oldest 78 RPM recordings sound terrific (solo piano especially), and there are 14 CDs of them.  The bass is full-bodied.<br />(3) If there's information on exactly which technology was applied to each disc, I haven't found it yet.  Were some 78s produced from tapes? A little on the transitions from 78 to tape and from mono to stereo would have satisfied my curiosity more.<br />(4) The box is heavy.  Don't let Grandma lift it.
B00GX59QO2|5.0|Dare I say better than the first? Yes, I do! With a full house ( ages 15 to 82)  all laughed hard at this fun movie. I might just by a DVD of it!
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This is a nice version of Free Cell, one of my favorite time-wasters. Lol. No problems at all with the app, and it's easy to see and fun to play.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Really, if you have not seen Downton Abbey by now you must just have gotten back from a tour on the space station. So see season one, fall in love with the story, the history, and the acting of this fine series. Season two's only flaw is that it ended too quickly.
B008XKSW7M|4.0|I'm not much of a movie watcher, but this was a good movie, light and funny, with some emotion. Your usual romantic/comedy/drama.
B004LWZWBU|5.0|Love the oddness of the story. But this director never fails me. Either you love his work (Moonrise Kingdom) or you just don't have his sense of humor. Lucky for me I do.

B00GP0G0IK|3.0|Good game; however, be prepared to wait, wait, wait between each action.  Play when you want to sit down for a good long time.  Making progress painful!
160459201X|5.0|This Book is Dr. Murphy's best!  It includes templates for prayers to guide your thoughts. The chapters are more focused to specific areas in your life.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I adore The Piano Guys and my sweet husband bought this as an early Christmas gift. I even play a copy for my 18mo son who goes to sleep with this every night.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|This game is super fun and addicting! It's so much fun and makes the hours fly by. I highly recommend it.
B005M0R4X4|5.0|This is one of the BEST and most intriguing  series I have ever watched.  The acting is extraordinary in this show
B000OCXMAE|5.0|Great
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Fabulous. The series will tear at your heart and make you root for these people. Every character is unique and entertaining. Loved it.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Whenever I have spare time I play Solitaire.  This is a great format and I enjoy game after game.  I win most of the time and if I don't win I can't wait to start a new game.  It calms the nerves, gives you a way to be active even when you're sitting and having that second cup of coffee.  I've played Solitaire on my computer but this format is so nice because I can sit comfortably in my chair in my bedroom and often I play it while I'm also playing Words with Friends.  I think its good for us to be using our brain as often as possible and this is a fun way to do it.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Loved it til the end. Absolutely hated the ending. But a great story of how the future could be. Worth reading.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|This is where it all started in 1978, many have come and gone because of it, some good, some bad, but for one of his first works he showed he is someone that when he's gone his mark will remain
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I have only been playing this game for a short time and I am already addicted to it. I love the sound effects. I really look forward to playing it daily. Give it a try, it,s free!
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|John Grisham has written another fast paced, compelling novel and with a message.  The characters are  believable and you would like to meet some of them.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Such a wonderful album. ThePianoGuys have a way of turning any song into a newly mastered work of art. Now, with their Christmas album, they can help keep us through this wonderful, but stressful, time of the year.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|These guys make the most beautiful, imaginative music around and they have struck gold with this album. I bought it immediately and love it. It will be the primary sound track for my Christmas.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I find myself looking forward to playing and hate when I run out of lives and then play the bonus level only to have to waite sometimes 24 hours before I can play again. But I guess its better than paying 99&cent; every level so I will be patient.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I have read most of the Scarpetta series. I would recommend to anyone that is looking for a good book, with a good story. They are very consistent across the books.
B008JFUP0I|3.0|May you Rest In Peach forever Paul Walker.  I will miss you along with all your fans. One of my favorite actors. Loved his work in Fast and Furious, Joy Ride, 8 Below, Pawn Shop Chronicles, Pleasantville, and especially Running Scared.  I just wish it was a bad dream, that i would wake up and it was just a big joke.  Unfortunately that is not going to happen.  I just wish you wouldn't have gotten in that Porsche with that dude who obviously didn't know what the heck he was doing.  Maybe it was a fluke accident, a blown tire?  a cat crossing the road? Either way it doesn't bring you back.  Godspeed Paul.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I loved the book at the end when it said there is no district twelve any more I was shocked then I went too see the movie it was awesome! Thank you for coming up with the hunger games I can't wait to see the mokingjay
B0036S4B6M|4.0|Through her first hand account Ms. Kerman's memoir educates the reader on aspects of the prison industry that we pay for, but know very little about.  Where else would we see the demographics of the women's pen, get glimpses of the inside routine, and learn a few of the official rules and unwritten rules of surviving incarceration. What might initially seem like unlikely friendships become understood as obvious, necessary and lasting friendships.<br /><br />On some level I knew that serving time was more about loss of privacy and privilege, than about rehab, but it is still discouraging to learn how little use is made of all that time served by prisoners.<br /><br />It was also a surprise to learn the overwhelming increase in our country's incarceration rate, esp for non-violent offenders. Sounds like law enforcement is able to get the low-hanging fruit, who then fill up prisons serving mandatory minimum sentences.  I did find it re-assuring to read the list of  organizations that are trying to improve the penal system.
B00A8MGLAI|4.0|one of my favorite movies in recent years.  Great story lines and exceptionally well acted.  One of the few movies I can watch multiple times and pick up nuances I've missed in earlier viewings.  Love it!
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is my favorite version of his movie. Me and my kids love it! Buying one for my mom and dad this year.
B002SSBD6W|5.0|The author has carefully researched a subject most of us know at least a little about, but keep in a subterranean level of our minds. That way we can continue to eat what tastes good, and Is cheap and readily available. I will never again be able to say \\"I didn't really know.\\" I will never be able to eat the same way again. Thank you, Mr. Foer, from the bottom of my heart, for shaking me out of my \\"forgetfulness.\\"
B000R6PKP2|5.0|As this is probably my favorite movie I had to have this ultimate collectors set.  I've watched every version this set comes with and every version is just as good as the next.  I don't particularly have a favorite version as each version is too similar to really knit pick at although i will say even though the voice over version is what most people did not like, it has a special place in my heart because that is the one i watched in the theaters as a kid with my dad.  The little extras the box set comes with are nice, the Police Spinner is cool and the origami is a nice touch.  I recommend this to all serious blade runner fans.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|A very useful book for those who are new to weightlifting. It helps you manage your diet for maximum amount of weight loss and/or muscle gain. The program laid out doesn't have you spending hours in the gym each day and one will still see a large amount of progress. It cuts out all the BS and doesn't have you spending large sums of cash for &#34;needed&#34; supplements. Also the author Mike is very helpful and interactive with everyone and will answer any questions that you send him. He is genuinely interested in helping people meet their health and fitness goals.
B000Y7U98W|5.0|Totally underrated movie. The visuals alone make this movie worth the buy.  I recommend this movie 100%.  Acting is superb, story is intriguing and the visuals are as stunning as they get.  I recommend this to any true sci fi fan.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love it. so much fun. new to game. levels are great. cant stop playing. now I know what everyone is talking about.  thank you
B001AVCFK6|4.0|4 stars for the movie...didnt watch any of the features as i didn't really care to.  I hope someday i will go back and check it out as i really loved this movie and I am not a Star Trek Fan, which is probably why I enjoyed this movie so much.
B00DP8XSQ2|2.0|First of all, I think the bad reviews are exaggerated:<br />- there is no virus<br />- Kindle Fire HD DOES find the location if online<br /><br />The program has quite a few settings, including night mode, but YES, the ads on top make night view not very efficient.<br />It's okay if there weren't a better alternative: The free version of SkEye has almost the same layout, does in fact turn with you on Kindle until you touch the screen and has info on all stars. This cannot compete in any way.
B001J53X9U|3.0|This is probably the best movie of the trilogy.  The batpod is nice little keepsake, but I gave it 3 stars not because of the movie, because the movie itself is great, but the special features and the batpod didn't justify the price.  At the time i bought it, I thought I had to have this item, but just getting the regular blu ray would have been fine.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I absolutely love this CD...it is awesome! It makes me feel great & it touches my soul to the very core.
B001PPLIFU|4.0|I love Daniel Craig as Bond.  He brings a grit to Bond that none of the others had which is what I think Ian Flemming envisioned Bond to be like.
B000JMKNJ2|1.0|Well, I don't often stop ready a book, only made it half way.  However, this is one of those instances.  Of the thousands of books I've read over the years, this is one of the poorest written.  The idea starts sound and it's almost criminal that an editor let this book slide through in the state that it is in.  There are huge chunks of the book that are clearly fluff and dont pertain to the story line or development at all.  Any editor worth thier salt would have cut out a third of the book and put it in some semblance of order.  At least then thier may have been more of a cohesive story.  Also, and this may be the kindle version only, but the back and forth in font size is really annoying.  The only thing I can think of to the persons stating that this book was 5 stars must have been paid or really just skimmed this book.
B001KVZ6G6|5.0|Great film.  Features are really great as they really go into detail into how the movie is made.  I really enjoyed where they show you how they got the inspiration for paradise falls.  5 stars for the movie and the extra features.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|For real though. Those who created this product covered all bases including fun ways to wake up while making it user friendly. I think the name blows but who needs a good name when the product is just that good.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|5 Stars for the movie but from what i can remember there isn't much difference from the normal cut and directors cut. When I watched it, I couldn't tell but maybe it was because I don't remember how the original went.  I'll have to look that up one day.  Another sci fi fan must buy!
B00FPH6PRK|5.0|I have to say as of now this is my favorite movie. It's not bloody gore scary but good old fashion ghostly scary. And that's my favorite type of movie. It's also based off a true story.
B00C061I3K|5.0|Random Access Memories is the best full album to be released since The Wall. This is a must have for anyone that isn't completely deaf.<br /><br />Favorite Track: Instant Crush
B0091W0JPE|5.0|One of the best movies ever.. Maybe my number one or two.. Wish I could give it 6 stars. Not one moment of cheese or wasted comic relief. Entertains from minute one.  Ingrid Bergman in the 40's?  Need I say more?
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Great book.  I think his best in a while.  I enjoyed the reading th esame characters as in A Time to Kill.
1932100660|5.0|I would like to know if there is anything that comes close to being a more comprehensive book on nutrition. I would also like to see some of the non profit cancer organizations doing some follow up research on this book.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I started to read this book because of the movie. I have never cried like this move a book. I would recommend this to anyone.
0981951244|5.0|Very comparable to the Slight Edge by Jeff Olsen with more valuable worksheets in the back. Overall, a very easy to read book with practical insights. Highly recommend this book
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|Match three has never been this much fun. There`s more to it than just passing levels, and I`'ve yet to be stuck on one. For Kindle,, prepare for a long download time.
B00EJU8ZIG|5.0|It's refreshing.  The social message in Royals seems to be accepting oneself outside conspicuous consumption and that is nice to hear for a change.  Not nearly as trite as a lot of it's contemporaries.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|The app itself is fine. I'm not a Facebook fan. My wife is the facebookaholic and enjoys using it several times a day.
B0007TKNIS|5.0|Can't say enough about this movie.  The music actually brought me to appreciate more opera.  Andrew Lloyd Weber is brilliant but this particular music gets under your skin.  Gerard Butler's depth of the character of the phantom is definitely his best acting.  His singing is tortured and soulful and prevokes emotion as it should for his character..  Emmy Lou Rossum's voice is astounding.  She has done Sarah Brightman (the original Christine on stage) proud.  The acting and singing from everyone in this movie top notch. I used to watch this over and over when I first learned of the movie (unfoturnately not in 2004 when it was released!) and my beloved cat (who is gone now) became my little opera kitty as I called him as he would relax with me and seemed to appreciate the music.  A friend's son kept singing the Angel of Music words repeatedly, and another friend's niece absolutely loves the movie too.  So, not just for adults!  One of my favorites.<br />SE
B00G1YAD42|5.0|It is loud and clear! , I like the sound and effect of the alarm clock. it's great if you are a heavy sleeper.
1476727651|5.0|Vintage Stephen King!  Everything I love about his writing is here for the taking...great premise, fascinating characters, and a story that kept me reading through the night.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I just cant stop playing. This is a great game and it makes it all the better being free. Keep up the good work!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Very, very addictive!  I knew if I started this I would not be able to stop and I was RIGHT!!!
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This games fun but it takes to long to get on the track... anyway apart from that it's very amusing
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|Only complaint is I reached a goal and it still said I failed. Was very upset. But I still play because the damn game is addictive.
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This is a great app i recommend it to anyone who's a fan of the movie. Also try any of the other RG games
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|An extremely addictive fun game.  Great for passing time, while waiting. Easy to learn to play.  The in app purchasing is unneeded for game enjoyment.  Would recommend this game.
B00594XOZU|5.0|Kik is ok but it lags and freezes a lot! But it is still a fast free way to text internationally without connection problems!
034552554X|5.0|Great book...complete page turner. I enjoyed learning about all the different flowers, being a gardener. I bought a copy for my daughter as well?
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|I like it except for to level up you have to spend a lot of time in the missions. I like that some but maybe wish it took a little less time so I don't spend so much time on it a day.  I've been playing for a couple weeks and haven't added any friends even though I'm on Facebook and I'm still leveling up without using crowns. If you like the Facebook version you will like this one.
B00FPH6AXE|3.0|This is a decent movie, but with only two main characters, it's hard to keep feeling invested in the action as it happens.  The scenes change every 5 minutes or so and you'd think this would be enough to keep me engaged.  Unfortunately, there's not enough emotion, suspense to keep me interested.
B00D1VKZ3M|5.0|Awesome hilarious read. Flowed on well from the last book.Can already see the next movie with beautiful Renee of course!
B00GH4R95C|1.0|it was the most boring movie I ever sat watched. It was a waste of money- don't waste your money or your TIME
B00EK0UBPU|2.0|Really disjointed & slow moving. Am really working hard to finish it. Quite a disappointment after winning that great award
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|J-cole has proved himself in this album. Showing he is a lyricist, how he got sucked into worldly things and then humbled himself. I appreciate all the words he spoke. I was very impressed how he actually made a track about his idol Nas not accepting his single off his first album. J-cole deserves more credit than he was given for this album. Best album of 2013!
0307887448|5.0|There are plenty of reviews of this book, but I want to give a bit of guidance to those who are wondering if their kid might like it.<br /><br />When I first read it, I wasn't sure it would appeal to kids because of the 80s references. But the boys I know who are around 12-13 years old LOVE it. And my 11-year-old daughter just finished it and SHE loved it.<br /><br />I thought it was amazing. I read a lot of YA fiction. Strangely, this is one that has stuck with me a year after I read it, which is fairly rare.<br /><br />Just GET IT!!!
B00FYZNPSA|4.0|It's a fun kids and family movie.  Not as good as the first, but very entertaining. Yes, would recommend to anyone.
B00BATG18K|1.0|Long and remarkably dull for such a complicated saga. Even the sex wasn't erotic. Very disappointing. Amy Tan needs to get over her mama issues, been there, done that again and again.
B003YL4LYI|3.0|This is part 2 of what should have been written differently.  The I am going to tell half the story for half the characters technique stinks.
B00AFEY354|5.0|I don't know what to say, this movie really moved me. &#34;Perks&#34; definitely deserves more praise, it is a fantastic movie about our young life. I am so glad I watched the film, its a keeper. I still have tears in my eyes, I know , I sound like some chic. Watch it , great flick.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|If you enjoy the rest of The Piano Guys music, this is a must buy.  Their creativity and musical genius is second to none.  If you want a Christmas album that you can have on in the background while you work or are doing anything else, this is perfect.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Love this game! Challenging but not too difficult. Mindless but addictive play. Plays well on my Kindle Fire. Need to get it on my phone too.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|I could spend hours playing it.  The most fun I 've had playing a game. Can't wait till the next saga comes out.  MLaws
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I don't really read books. When ever I try to read a book I end up hating it or its just to boron to keep going. I also have the problem that I can't read well.<br />Still when I find a book that I like that's the only book that I will read. It's like after you get done warring your favorite food you just want more even if you know what it is like. I have read this book many times and each time I find a new thing to love.<br />This time I bout it from Amazon with the reader. The voice just before it to life. I cried at many points in the book.<br />If you don't mind slightly depressing books and love stories this would be the best book.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|Another great book by Diana Gabaldon.<br />Jamie and Claire came to start a new colony, they named Fraser's Ridge, in North Carolina. Brianna,their daughter.who is in 1968, finds an old news clipping claiming Jamie and Claire, died in a fire on January 21, 1776, and she goes back in time to save them.  Roger finds this out and goes back, in time, for Brianna.  This is another,can't put down book.  It  is fantastic. You will love it. There is a lot of story in this book, a lot of plots, and intrigue.  You would think that there are so many plots an author can put into her series of books, but low and behold,  Gabaldon just keeps them coming up, and they are all great. I highly recommend this book and the whole series.<br /><br />Germaine Rosenquist
B00C7D3TRO|5.0|New Favorite Band. I'd heard one or two songs by FB but now I'm a convert. After downloading, I liked it so much, I played all the way through twice.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Wonderful! Just wonderful! Original takes on old songs, old songs done the way they should be, and a few new songs.

B000002O96|4.0|Should we assume that these 7 tracks are &#34;leftovers&#34; from the SUPER BLUES album? Yes, seems the party was losin' steam somewhere aroyund track 3..but that's okay.. the partiers (both in the studio and at home) get the best of the blues...the lowdown, country blues, nothing uptown or even downtown here.<br /><br />Cookie Vee (Bo's assistant on stage and off) tries mightily to keep Bo's recent hit single (OOH! BABY) on course and fairly succeeds....by singing the same part she did on record...but Bo, Muddy, and Wolf, seem more interested in the blackberry wine and potato salad.<br /><br />Quieter and more enjoyable are the slow numbers, like LITTLE RED ROOSTER and GOIN' DOWN SLOW.<br /><br />So you got the idea...it's a fun get together of many geniuses...nothing to reverse the rotation of the planet.<br /><br />Let's not forget that Buddy Guy, on bass, and Otis Spann, on piano, get a chance to show off, too.<br /><br />Let me say, finally, that for &#34;new&#34; fans, it would be wise to survey Amazon for &#34;Greatest Hits&#34; packages on these artists before crashing this party. And don't come empty-handed. Something nice and imported will work, too.
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|We live in an age of escalating surveillance–one in which personal privacy is increasingly rare, and more and more of our lives are shared publicly on the Internet. So perhaps it’s no surprise that The Circle, by Dave Eggers, takes things a few steps further with his novel, introducing us to a very Google-like company named The Circle, in which they are at the forefront of technology, with seemingly endless resources available to make their bold visions a reality. The Circle’s goal is to capture all human knowledge and make it available to the masses. But this type of all-encompassing information-gathering comes with a high cost.<br /><br />The Circle focuses on Mae Holland, a newly-hired employee, as she begins her career with the technology company. It’s immediately obvious that The Circle is an analogy to modern-day Google, with its over-the-top benefits, campus-wide parties, and nearly anything employees could desire available to them–day or night. As Mae settles into her new position, she’s overwhelmed by how lucky she is to be part of this amazing group, especially after spending her first two years out of college working in a drab cubicle at a utility company in her tiny home town. She not only feels incredibly lucky to be part of The Circle, but somehow undeserving of the job. The first few chapters are a whirlwind of introductions to resources available on the campus, and to how much information the company collects–and expects their employees to contribute. At first, the comparisons to Google are obvious, but the novel quickly moves beyond even what Google currently provides, into a different level entirely. Oddly, this is both one of the novel’s strengths, as well as its weakness; as more and more statistics get introduced, it nearly overpowers the narrative of the story, becoming instead a list of social media “to-dos”, rather than a functional story.<br /><br />Much of the book is spent introducing concept after concept; TrueYou, SeeChange, ChildTrack, SoulSearch, PastPerfect, Demoxie, and countless other names are thrown around, with each new program introducing increasingly pervasive levels of surveillance, until there’s no such thing as privacy any longer. Politicians are forced to wear cameras at all times, streaming their entire lives to the world, or face persecution for failing to do so. All of these programs are well-intentioned, but the ramifications of them are far-reaching and disturbing beyond measure. Indeed, a totalitarianism is hinted at, as politicians who voice criticisms of The Circle suddenly are found to have child-porn on their computers, or some skeleton in their closet–buried in their past–is suddenly uncovered, leading to their ruin. Perhaps these events are coincidental, but people seem to accept the explanations as fact. After all, The Circle is incapable of fault, right?<br /><br />What makes this novel so intriguing isn’t the outlandish invasions of privacy that The Circle is able to obtain, but that Eggers paints a portrait of Orwellian society in-the-making–one that is all too believable, considering the current state of technology. Already, today’s Internet companies have extraordinary access to data, and the ramifications of this is just beginning to come to the public consciousness. The Circle takes current events just a little bit further, and serves as a cautionary tale to show what might happen if these companies’ aren’t reigned in before it’s too late.<br /><br />Despite the intrigue, the novel does have its share of faults. The main character, Mae Holland is rather naive,and her idealism leads the reader to question her sanity from time to time. It’s often a frustrating read, to have the author point out more and more disturbing revelations, only to have Mae rationalize things and accept the latest egregious assaults against civil liberties. She seems forgetful of things that are rather crucial, and even cold-hearted as she turns her back on her past to embrace The Circle wholeheartedly. Eggers introduces so many concepts and spends so much time detailing how many ‘screens’ the characters use, that it sometimes feels like a diary of going to work each day–albeit at an amazingly generous company–to the point of feeling mundane. Entire plot points get left out, like the treatment of her father’s illness, and their lack of participation in the newest programs of The Circle. There are times it’s particularly unbelievable that society as a whole is embracing what The Circle has to offer, yet they seem to do so–in increasing numbers.<br /><br />Despite its shortcomings, however, The Circle is a must-read novel, if only to highlight the strange nature of today’s society, and how the information we share can be used. Internet companies probably know more about us than we do ourselves, and the more we share, the more they learn about not only us, but our friends and loved-ones as well. It’s a thought-provoking adventure into a what-if future. It’s one of today’s 1984-style novels that should be read, discussed, and argued. After all, that’s what makes a good book transcend the genre and become a great book.

B0036T31YY|3.0|Have you ever seen a movie that you really wanted to like, but didn't? Triangle has a really great cast and some very memorable scenes, but the story goes around in circles, to a point that's beyond Groundhog's Day, stopping at frustration. The story follows a group of friends that go sailing on a boat called the Triangle. While they are leaving from Florida, there is never any mention of the Bermuda Triangle. Everything is going well, when a sudden freak storm appears, capsizing the small vessel. As they hang onto the remains of the boat, they find a cruise ship passing by and hop on, but to their dismay, they find the huge ship to be empty. The story here is very cleaver and original, I was really into this film at first, however the Writer/Director, Christopher Smith, goes too far, making it one of those film, you really want to just be over and done with. Melissa George plays the lead and she was terrific. It's George's performance that kept me watching the movie, even after I had become bored with it. In Triangle, she's paired with a very young, Liam Hemsworth, in his first major film role. Even at the young age of 19, you can see just how good he is. Acting seems to come natural to him and after the Hunger Games series, I expect big things from him. Triangle is an extremely interesting idea, but it's not for everybody. It's one of those weird Science Fiction films that tows the line for a while, but ultimately goes too far and becomes weird to a fault.
B00EQRMLNM|5.0|First I must start off with a cautionary note, and that is the choice of music is subjective.  My personal taste is mellow R&B, which this songs fits.  Nice smooth sound.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|Great movie and gift for any big fan of Star Trek in your family. The young Star Trek cast does a great job.
B00CW7KK9K|5.0|I love my Withings Pulse, the new Gamification where you can achieve badges when you walk a certain number of steps as well as for distance and elevation achieved in your lifetime, is a huge motivation for me, it makes it fun to walk and challenges you to take the stairs.<br /><br />As for the wristband, as many others I find it a bit flimsy, but have yet to wake up without the Pulse securely placed on my arm, so no real complains there, although it is a bit difficult to put on at night.<br /><br />The latex belt strap seems unnecessary unless you go running in something completely without pockets, but I would still hesitate t use it, I doubt it'll fall out if I wear it on my t-shirt collar, but it could be designed for more protection.<br /><br />The Pulse itself is so automatic I seldom look at it anyway, I just check the Withings Health Mate every day to check my progress, it's mostly for showing off that 50.001 steps I took last week but sadly in a week or so it'll be too far in the past to see it.<br /><br />The automation is what I love most though, the sleep pattern is good to check if the cat is behaving or waking me up at 4 in the morning, but the automatic gauging of my daily steps is definitely the killer feature for me at least. Tat plus the new gamification.
B008IJT0CE|4.0|This app is really worth it If you have a hard time getting to sleep. I would suggest it to anyone!

B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I will say that the game kept engrossed ,  to the point of getting to. Bed late.  It was a little slow in places so I became a little bored but then something would happen and I would be engrossed again.  If you decide to play, have a fun time.
031623480X|5.0|This is a must read book for anyone handling today's common health issues of weight gain, mood troubles, chronic inflammation, diabetes, heart disease, more. These are all connected and explained in comprehensbile terms from the amazing knowledge of underlying science. Thank you for writing this book without which we would still be lemmings to Big Pharma and Food Inc Jincluding so-called &#34;health foods&#34;K
B00FATEJYE|5.0|I had this game on the iPhone and it was amazing.so I was wondering if they wound put it on the kindle. And you all did. It was cool on the iPhone and it is cool on the kindle.

B000FBJAEG|5.0|One of Baldacci's best!  Thrilling, fast-paced, well-constructed tale.  The title is true to the timing throughout the book.  Did not put it down until I was finished.
B0032O6S4I|3.0|Way too many pieces.  I really do not recommend this for a child under 12 years of age.  This is a top that the parent will definitely be putting together over and over for young ones.  Pieces were lost within 20 minutes of opening.  Very frustrated!!
B00BAXFJ5M|5.0|Great novel, but I was somewhat duped when I started to read it as a &#34;new release&#34; and discovered I had read the book long before.  I guess I misinterpreted and it was a new release for Amazon.  Regardless, super good read!
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|The top grossing tour of 2012 hits Blu-Ray at last. There's a reason Madonna is the undisputed Queen of Pop. The top selling female artist of all time knows how to put on a show. The Blu-Ray perfectly captures the enormous production that is the MDNA tour. The audio quality is top notch and the visuals are stunning. The editing is perfect and really gives a viewer the sense that they are the show. The MDNA Tour is a spectacle and this Blu-Ray is the perfect companion piece.
B005NFJAT4|5.0|With out a doubt, at least on this persons opinion, the best movie on Gettysburg ever. This should not be compared to a Ken Burns documentary because it is written as a story and meant for theater or TV.  That said you won't find a movie better scripted, filmed, acted or closer to the actual events and people involved at Gettysburg than this one.<br />Sit back and go back and be at the scene in Gettysburg July 1863, sweat in heat so humid and sweltering that even southerners couldn't stand it. Be part of the smell of death that fills the battlefield when it is finished.
B00BFIFIPS|5.0|Very nice and sleek indeed.  It keeps your iphone safe and yet keeps its elegance at the same time.  Furthermore, the middle colored section is removable and replaceable without having to remove the whole casing.  So I plan to get all my favorite colors of it to go with my clothes or moods.  A brilliant idea!

B007IXWKUK|2.0|75% of the book is spent on exhausting step by step descriptions.<br />&#34;He opens a drawer and pulls out two black placemats for the breakfast bar. I pour the egg mix into a pan, pull out the bacon, turn it over, and put it back under the grill.&#34;<br />God, i almost nodded off. 50 shades Darker is a big book of instructions...
B00FRQ32N4|2.0|It's boring - I got bored of it very quickly.  The fights are boring, the upgrades are not exciting, and the controls are simple, maybe too simple.  Either way I am not a fan of the on-screen keypad controller which is what really was the show stopper.  The graphics are actually very good though hence the 2 stars.
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|The Rosie Project is a funn read about a nerdy man, with a checklist, looking for a wife, I recommend it highly!!!

B001NSAJ3G|5.0|This is a real classic &#34;must have&#34; that has stood the test of time.  Use of an orchestra and a theme for the whole album, rather than just a collection songs, changed rock for decades since.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Disturbing but a great game for those who are interested in how disease and pestilence can take over the world.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Is there anything negative to be said about the Harry Potter films?!?!?!?! I truly believe its one of the best book adaptations and does the series justice throughout each film. This set is the perfect gift for any fan as it has every single movie compacted nicely in a slim case. It's much better than having the films individually because it saves space & who wouldn't want a uniform set?!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|My mother passed April 13, 2013. I remember watching a conference before my mother died online and Anita Moorjani was on it talking about her experiences. I planned then to read the book. Never did. Mom died and I needed some comfort. This book gave it to me and allowed me to cope with the idea that someday I will die too. I feel that everyone should read this book whether religious or not. This book causes you to soul search and reflect about your own life and dreams.<br /><br />Anita thank you for creating this book.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Perfection in music... The Piano Guys are quickly becoming our favorite Christmas album next to Bing Crosby.  With music both traditional and hymns it is a wonderful mix for Christmas.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Recently purchased 2 of these, the first one was connected to my Samsung Surround Sound system, I love it because when the system notices that Chromecast is beginning to stream, it automatically switches to the correct input.  No issues with lagging, I stream movies Via Google Chrome to my Chromecast all the time.<br /><br />Now the 2nd one, i'm not sure what the issue is.  It hardly ever works, i'm lucky if my Chrome Browser even notices that this thing is connected to my network.  if i'm lucky enough to get them to connect, there's constant lag and stuttering and disconnects.  This 2nd Chromecast is the extact same distance away from my Router as the first one I purchase.  Not sure what the problem is, it's currently back in it's box not being used, may do some more testing later to see what the deal is.  I took 1 star off because of this.
B00F54NGSE|3.0|We waited a year for this movie to be released and as soon as it was available on Amazon, we ordered it...<br />Amazon's service and delivery was excellent, however, the movie is not one of Danny Trejo's best or even second best.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|the ending of this trilogy left something to be desired.  underwhelming and disappointing are more appropriate terms to use.  I wanted to see katniss in a blaze rather than go completely insane. I would've also liked more on her and peeta's relationship and what became of Gale.
B008Y78GYI|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. It was so nice to watch it when I was ready rather then finding it channel surfing and trying to watch it while my family had activities goin on.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|For its price it is the best extra media experience you can buy. It is very quick and easy to get setup and running. This is also a big hit at parties. Get all your guests on your next work, show them the app, and just watch all the random and fun music/videos get played!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|It was very hard to put down. Makes me wish I had take. The time to read the other two before I saw them in the theaters. Oh well as Katniss learns, u can only go forward.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|NKOTB fan for 25 years.  No need to say more, this album is excellent!  Up to date music, fun, exciting, emotional,....all excellent!  VERY pleased!!  I hope these guys continue to make music so my daughters can become fans as well! :-)

1451666179|5.0|I adore Ali Brosh. She's hilarious and poignant at the same time. I've followed her blog for years, and even with a few repeat stories, it's a great buy. The book had me laughing so hard I was crying (as usual).
B002UWH8P6|5.0|Great show. I found it to be very engaging, although I had never watched it when it was first on.

B002JN553S|2.0|While the book itself is in pretty good condition, its not the hard civer pictured. . . .bit disgruntled with that vision of what my book would look like. My own copy is a pink / peach duo.
B004LQEYAG|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  The actors and good and appear to be having fun making the movie.  The soundtrack is outstanding as well.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|The depth of research and understanding of what Brown found drives this plot. Especially enjoyable is his use of symbols and belief systems that entwine the Masonic organization with present day neotic science study. You don't have to believe any of it to thoroughly enjoy this novel.
B00DT99BX6|5.0|I have to give Pawn of Innocence a 5 star because I loved Armand and Camille's adventure,  but also because of the awesome sights and sounds feature! This is the first time I've seen this cool thing done where at various points throughout the book, there are links and if you want to hear the music the author suggests, or see how she envisioned the ball gown, or cabin in the woods, you can click the link and it will take you to pictures and sounds!<br /><br />I loved the adventure Camille was on rather she did or not! We could only be so lucky to have a guy like Armand following us around all day making sure we are safe. It was a fast read and kept me on the edge of my seat both with action and also if she'd ever get her man!<br /><br />I was emotionally drawn in to the point at one moment I thought I might have to reach out and strangle the author if things were to go a certain way! Ahhhh!<br /><br />Definitely will read Chameleon again!
B00E9HML1Q|5.0|The added content is great and the statue is very well done.  Well worth waiting for this particular edition.  It would be nice if they released the extended editions sooner.
B00C061I3K|1.0|I think the fact that everyone describes this as disco tells you all you need to know. Save your ears.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|Literally amazing. Refreshing! About a topic and a system we don't know nearly enough about. Eye-opening. Everyone should read this book!
B00GQ7PILC|4.0|I finally watched the final episode. From all the reports about how bad the finale was, I was expecting to be let down. I was so nervous watching, as the only thing I cared about was Harrison being OK and Harrison not being separated from Dexter. I was amazed how they wrote this and were able to have me think about it and agree that Harrison was better of with Hanna (even though it was sad to know he would be separated from Dexter). It was a happy ending in the sense of knowing Harrison would not be at risk because of having a serial killer daddy and the enemies that we know come with that. The bummer of the ending for me was the fact that Dexter did not die. I'm torn on that. It seems he should have followed through on that to protect Harrison. The other side of the coin though is that it is sort of true to the character that, as has been mentioned by others in the series, Dexter is about survival and all about his own survival at the end of the day. No matter who he loves, he loves no one above him self and will do whatever it takes to not be caught. Not a bad final episode.
B00FR0GT9Y|5.0|I just wanted to add an update to this review I originally wrote, the first chance to auto-rip this cd, before I even received it.<br />I still have been listening to this album since the day it was released, and my opinion has only gotten stronger from my original review.<br />To anyone even considering this purchase - look elsewhere, anywhere else on the internet or in print, for reviews (no disrespect for those who actually appreciate this album for what it is). If you ever liked Boston, buy it - without listening to the negative opinions. Listen to it closely. Then listen to it again. I fail to see how anyone who actually likes Boston cannot appreciate this album. I personally appreciate every Boston album for what they are, and when they appeared on the music scene. This is just another great Boston album to add to their discography. Sure, it can be picked apart, but any album - great, good or bad can. I just hope there is still more to come.<br /><br />This is the first review I've ever actually written, and I've been buying music here hand over fist for years.<br />I feel compelled to write this, partly because I can possibly see some less than positive reviews coming in, just based on the 'classic Boston' opinions; and partly because this CD just blew me away.<br />I want to write this with the understanding that I have been a Boston fan since I was 12 years old in 1976, and I do realize the classic Boston tracks are obviously the standard that any Boston fan holds any subsequent releases up to. With that said, over the years since their first two releases, we have had a consistent traditional sound, though many have felt a good portion of the music just didn't hold up.<br />With this release, I feel Tom Scholz has put out the best Boston album since, possibly, Don't Look Back.<br />The beauty of this album, is that it's a very eclectic mixture - some tracks with Brad Delp, some with Kimberley Dahme, and even some remakes on some older tracks - but it all holds together as a 70's Boston album, and still with a fresh sound to boot!!<br />Heaven On Earth and Life, Love And Hope, and Someday could have easily come out of the late 70's Boston. The Way You Look Tonight is reminiscent of the Walk On period; and Sail Away from Corporate America. There is NOTHING filler on here - even the instrumental track Last Day Of School is outstanding.<br />This Is Boston. Go out and buy it! Now! This is the kind of music that can make a 49 year old Boston fan like me feel like he's in his 20's again! (and it does!!)<br />Tom - if your listening, PLEASE, keep them coming; and don't keep us waiting so long???

0066620996|5.0|Good to Great by Jim Collins<br /><br />The book is very detailed in that it tells you exactly what they did during the research to select the companies that they considered to have gone through the transformation from Good to Great. Also, he chooses comparison companies that are in similar fields of work as the Great companies. Throughout the book he constantly references what one company did right and what the other company did wrong. It's a great way to reinforce his idea for that specific chapter or section. Jim puts the book together and divides it into the buildup phase a company must go through before they get to their breakthrough to a great company. To achieve this a company must first have disciplined people then disciplined thought then finally disciplined action.  He ends the book comparing the research from Good to Great to his previous book Built to Last he makes points to how the companies that are great are essentially companies that are built to last; I do plan on reading Built to Last to see the similarities myself.<br /><br />One of Jim's unforeseen findings of a Level 5 Leader I found to be interesting. I used the definition of a Level 5 of having personal humility and professional will and succeeding as &#34;We&#34; and failing as &#34;I&#34; in a recent interview I had for a leadership position. Let's just say it went good. However, Jim doesn't know how a leader becomes a level 5 leader he was just able to determine the characteristics of the level 5 leader. His next idea that I agree with is getting the right people on the bus and the wrong ones off. It's pretty obvious to do this but to determine who is the right person may be difficult because they could be the right person for the company but not in the right role. This gets you as a reader thinking how can you apply this in your workplace as well as make yourself the right person for the company so you don't get let go. Also, any entrepreneurs thinking to start a company this book should be used a reference on how to structure the company and hopefully lead to your breakthrough to being Great. Just remember you must crawl, walk, then run will any decisions you make.

B002ZB26AO|5.0|It is a good read. Some say it is slanted but with the news I see on how visitors can be arrested for no cause it is clear that this country is paranoid and out of touch with most of the world. Just the way it's leaders like it.<br /><br />To be born there really is a curse.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Well thus far with this being a relatively new product there are few apps except those mentioned that work with it but being able to watch YouTube documentaries on my big screen is much better than starring at my note3.

B00B7FOQCK|2.0|While the company did respond quickly and replaced my original hub, this one exhibits the same issues. The majority of my USB devices simply do not fit -easily- into this hub. Something is just plain wrong with the alignment. A standard apple charging cable will simply not fit without using extreme force - so much so that you feel like you're going to break something.<br /><br />Again, while I appreciate the prompt and courteous response from the company, the item is still defective.
B001EYGOEM|5.0|I bought this CD for my daughter.  Taylor Swift has a gift for relative the beauty and travails of love with simple lyrics and melodies.  I did not expect to be drawn into her music, but after repeated plays by my daughter, I have grown to like her music.  A very nice CD.

B005HQ5S3G|4.0|I love Kelly Clarkson's voice; so, she can sing just about anything and I will like it.  My only complaint is that a couple of the songs sound too much like mainstream pop.  Kelly has a great voice; so, I wish she would record more music that demonstrate the versatility of her voice.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Too addictive! Just wish it would not keep asking to share my results. Have had several 'time outs' when losing a life :-)
B000RPTQ1C|5.0|This CD turned me into a Coldplay fan.  I bought it for my 13-year-old daughter who has played it over and over.  Overall, a very strong and powerful collection of songs.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This is one of those books you CAN'T read in one setting, and it's all-the-better for it!  It invites analysis of each section, in regards to who YOU are and how YOU interpret the descriptions.  It not only leads to interpretation, but to analysis of yourself.  I guarantee--if you consider yourself an &#34;intorvert&#34; or wonder how you fit into the social sheme of today's society, you''ll appreicate this book!  So many universal truths addressed within it!
B0006L16N8|5.0|I bought this CD for my 13-year-old daughter who has become a huge Coldplay fan.  Excellent mix of songs, and I have become a fan as well.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy install, works extremely well. I look forward to Chromecast being supported by many for apps as it develops a following
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Very enjoyable and interesting.  Pendergast seems to be very lonely in this story. I hope that changes in the future because I sure want more of Pendergast. This was so skillfully written I can't wait for the next book. This was  Very intense and scary but a fantastic book to read. Thanks again for giving me a wonderful story to live in.
1416596585|5.0|Well written and excellently researched. Steven Levy gives unique insight into the workings of google and all the talent that have made google what it is today.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|my favorite show so far, I cant wait for future episodes; the horror the way I like it, little bit of everything with taste and elegance and great cast! Jessica Lange - I only remember King Kong with her but her acting is spectacular
B0027MJU00|5.0|I loved this book. I enjoyed how it went back and forth from present to the time of the murders. I enjoyed reading from all of the characters eyes.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|quick access to tripadvisor on the road from the phone, fast and easy acces to your account and trip plans
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I enjoy playing bingo blitz, I am hooked..it is very easy for me to play.....I tell everybody to try the game out.....
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|good replacement, there isn't much more you can say about this, I needed a replacement and this worked.  the end
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|You get to have a very exciting adventure. One down side is that it is hard to earn coins easily. But i would still recommend for anyone to get this wonderful game.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|i love this game.  this game is beyond addictive.  i wish I could just keep playing without having to wait for more lives.
B00D23GXB2|5.0|I love poetry and I love erotica. Revenge of the Orgasm was just perfect for me. GPA's verses are attractive, magical, fascinating. I felt them deep in myself. I learnt to deal with my own emotions in a different way. I felt a true emotional explosion while reading it. I also rediscovered some feelings that were too hidden deep in myself.<br />Everybody who is not afraid to discover new erotic feelings should read this great poems. It's highly recommended book.
B00BATG18K|5.0|This is a fascinating, heartbreaking and loving book.  The look into Chinese culture and family traditions in the late 1800s and early 1900s is so enlightening.  All of the characters are flawed in some way, as all humans are, but that is how life is.  I read at night in bed before going to sleep.  I have not been able to put this book down.....it has kept me up way past my bedtime.  Great story-telling.
B001OGWY1W|5.0|Great movie, easy to download and watch on my laptop in bed. This is the same price I would pay to rent from a movie store and its a lot more convienent
B00BGD8CFK|4.0|Love this case!  Even had several questions as to where I purchased it.  However on a face down fall the phone can be ejected.
B00EY7LT9Q|5.0|Excellent show, Clark Gregg as the resurrected Agent Coulson is downright charismatic!  Good pace, inventive storylines, has the Whedon sense of humor.  Am glad I don't have to wait until a DVD of the season comes out in a year or so to watch the episodes again.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|You've taken beautiful music to a wonderful dimension. Thank you, thank you for your enthusiastic marvelous approach in making  melodious songs delicious to my ears… Linda Barker
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Been a Sherlock Holmes fan for forty plus years.  I went to see the movie originally because I was curious about Robert Downey Jrs take on the character.  Though people love to say how badly cast he was, I find nothing at fault with his performance.  The direction by Guy Ritchie is brisk and reflects his love of canon Holmes.  I absolutely adore that they've gotten rid of the Holmes tropes which are not based in in the original stories---like the stupid deerstalker hat (they were worn in the country only); the meerschaum pipe (William Gilette in the first theatrical representation of the character needed a curved pipe so that he could say his lines without the pipe falling out of his mouth).  Holmes WAS a martial artist it goes on and on with the return to the canon details.  Downey is brilliant in the role--his Holmes is wounded and vulnerable, but brilliant.  People say there is no deducing in the film---WRONG again--the Holmes visualizations are deductive reasoning turned visual.  My favorite Holmes will always be the late Jeremy Brett from the BBC/Granada tv programme--but Downey's take on the character comes in a very close second!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Could not put it down! A great read, troubling yet dynamic. A sign of a great book when you think about numerous times during the day and look forward to picking it up again. I want to go get Katniss and let her live here--:/
140006922X|5.0|I was in the Catholic seminary for two years. This book put all the pieces together. The story line makes sense after all these years.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game!  It is simple but challenges you. And friends can help you too with extra lives. FUN!
1452101248|5.0|Great book at a fair price delivered quickly. Completely satisfied with this purchase.  the box it came in was overly large for a book, but the product was good.
141659521X|5.0|I am a BIG fan of Vince Flynn and his writing style. He not only captures your imagination but also draws you in to some personal conflicts. I don't know where he gets his info, but all I can say is that it is very accurate.  Mr Flynn can and does describe the political power and the &#34;back stabbing&#34; that goes on in Washington.<br /><br />I was saddened to hear that he passed away but he will &#34;LIVE&#34; in my household and in my heart. GOD REST YOUR SOUL VINCE
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This is an instant Christmas classic album!  I have loved The Piano Guys for a long time and I am so glad they now have a Christmas album.  They are amazing and I was so excited to preview the cd and then to actually listen to it.  Totally worth buying!!!
B00GT67UUM|5.0|YES!!!  I love this game!  If you found The Room or The Howler your kind of game here is another in that very rare breed in gaming.  It takes thinking-no mindless point &amp; click here...  I can't wait for the grandkids to come over and (as with The Room) take to this steam punk world where cogs make machines fly and steam propels amazing gadgets,  very well worth the coinage!  More please!
B00F880BWG|5.0|The Walking dead is an amazing show. Always on the edge of your seat. You love characters and you hate others. A must watch from the first season :D enjoy
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Get this app<br />It is so cool because the level s are so  challenge and I love challenge levels<br />Bloom LiU
B00GX59QO2|5.0|This movie is just plain fun to watch. Its a great story line, played by famous actors who look like they enjoyed making this movie as much as I enjoyed watching it. RED= Retired, Extremely Dangerous.  It has guns, planes, helipcoptors, sports cars, more guns, girls with guns, martial arts, funny moments, suspense.... and more guns and explosions. RED2 cound also mean &#34;Really entertaining drama&#34; except its not a drama, per se.  I just couldn't think of a better word to put down. Check it out, it will make you smarter and better looking ;-)
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I gave this game a 4 out of 5 because while there are great graphics and gameplay is a lot of fun, this game lacks the actual hunting experience.<br /><br />There are several choices of objectives which adds some variety and if your weapon(s) are not quite up to par for certain objectives, you can earn money for upgrades with other weapons tackling the other objectives.<br /><br />It would be nice if players could explore more and actively seek out animals to kill.  Right now, the way the game is set up, animals appear right in front of you or run/fly right by/over you.  So objectives and goals are incredibly simple to accomplish.<br /><br />Aside from that, I am enjoying the game and I would say that anyone over the age of 10 (with parental guidance) can easily play this game.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|So fun to be the bio weapon class! My dad seems to act evil after playing this. FUN game must buy. need Dna stuff
B00F91RYL8|4.0|Very good, love Zombie movies, but too much along the lines of The Walking Dead.  Needed more originality, still worth rental cost.
B00A0R0CG0|5.0|Classic Ice Age! One of the few movie series that is still funny when they do more than one. LOVE the Ice Age movies- all of them.
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|Very funny, watched with 9 yo grandson and he thought it was very funny also.  Maybe not for younger toddler age, but great for the age 8+ and up.
B00FATEJYE|4.0|Its a great game, not many apps like it on kindle. No bugs so far, and great graphics. I would recommend<br /> this game for anyone who is a fan of the kustice league
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Great entertainment for kids and adults.  Vibrant colors and good family storyline.  A must for evening at home and good rental cost.
B008O037RG|2.0|the record was scratched when i got record player jumped the first time i played it. i only give it 2 stars because the music is so good
B006IGZWB2|3.0|I thought the storyline was good, but the acting &#34;not so much.&#34;  Wished I had read the book as I lost interest in watching this.
B000FCKGPC|2.0|Nothing like the first three books. Almost like a different writer in the beginning, I'm three quarters of the way through and am still waiting for something to happen. Beautiful characters developed in the first three... Are just cut off and discarded in this book. A crying shame.
0316055433|5.0|I think I might have permanently ruined my eyesight, so damn you and thank you, Donna tartt!  This is by far the best novel I've read in 15 or 20 years.  I was apprehensive and read most of the previous reviews before purchasing the kindle edition.  Here's the review I was looking for:  I loved secret history and couldn't get through 1/3 of little friend.<br /><br />As to the goldfinch, there is a richness to this novel that has been lacking in any of the novels ive read in years. Oh my gosh what happened?  I think the Dickensian references are apt.  We think of these novels as 'classics,' but remember in their day they were considered contemporary fiction.  She writes so beautifully and seemingly effortlessly, which given the time it took to produce, is obviously not the case.  I can't stand it when authors employ every literary construct so self consciously.  I don't want to watch actors 'act' or writers 'write,' if you know what I mean.  I simply want to be drawn into a compelling storyline. I was all in from start to finish.<br /><br />I've enjoyed the novels I've read over the last few years, the usual oprah book club stuff but I'd forgotten what it was like to really be engaged so thoroughly.  However, I don't want anyone who loves to read to be put off by the length or my glowing reviews of style. This is not in any way an inaccessible novel, not at all!<br /><br />Could not recommend more highly.  Not sure if this is the proper forum, but would love any recommendations for other reads from fans of the goldfinch!
B00GT67UUM|5.0|Another reviewer stated that this game reminded them of &quot; Doors&quot;. I completely agree, it's at a faster pace but uses your brain to get through each challenge. The puzzles get more difficult as you get further along in the game. I have just started playing and I am already hooked. This game is not for those who like quick and easy apps, it's for those who love a challenge, I loved it :-)
B005UKK4Y2|1.0|Absolutely horrendous movie. The plot was middle school grade. The character played by the dentist assistant made me want to pull my teeth out one by one.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This workout will really make you work even though it's only 20 minutes. I do find some of the upper body exercises are too tough but I guess that's what you need to work toward. I would recommend doing the cardio (butt kicks, jumping jacks, jump rope) on a yoga mat if you're working out in a basement as it's a bit tough on the joints/knees. Overall, Jillian is super motivating and explains why she has you doing each of the exercises.
B00DNLXDUW|1.0|This app did not work. I filled out the information and was not able to go any farther. I rate it 1 star because zero was not an option.
B002RV01QI|5.0|I love listening to her when I need to unwind from a bad day. Her music is so relaxing for me.
B004Q9SO0O|4.0|I gave it 4 stars for the whole collection, but if you are buying it to get The Sounds Of Jazz, the record version of the Seven Lively Arts The Sounds Of Jazz that CBS aired in 1957, you will be greatly, greatly disappointed...The Sounds Of Jazz record is a clean, crisp studio recording that is good, but (and I am usually a fan of studio versus live recordings) the album pales in comparison to the YouTube video The Greatest Jazz Films Ever - Part 2.....go there, download the audio, download the video, get it now, and just bask in the absolute raw energy, perfection, swing, and LIFE that these cats ooze from every pore....except for Jimmy Giuffre and Thelonious Monk...a little of both of them goes a long way in my book....but The Count and his men are just ON!  And Red Allen is just amazingly cool and hip...and even though a little Billie Holiday goes a long way as well, just the way she looks at the Prez says it all....and Joe Jones just makes it seem so easy....we are but mortals, compared to these gods.....
B000A7DVRC|5.0|This was a Christmas gift for someone in the family. He love this movie so much he watches this five time a day every day.
0425267695|5.0|This book was definitely worth a FULL read! I was disappointed to see that some reviewers were putting down the book after the first 100 pages or so. Take the time to read the entire book... it might start slow but you will thank yourself later. Anthony Ryan has created a very interesting world with interesting characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who has enjoyed Sanderson, Rothfuss, Goodkind, Feist or Weeks. Read it through. Give it a chance and I promise by the last page you will be begging for more :)
B004KBSQBA|5.0|Paul Simon has the greatest gift for many. The songs he right is great. I can listen to him al day.
B00338QENI|5.0|I heard about this book after an author interview on NPR. Rebecca Skloot crafted an amazing biography/historical account of HeLa cells. The author forged a hard earned relationship with Mrs. Lacks children, and her personal involvement with the family enabled her to write a respectful account of Mrs. Lacks legacy while preserving her dignity.  One of the better books that i have read in a while.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this game. it helps me clear my head. I love the special candies and different types of challenges for your brain.
1451666179|3.0|I love Allie. Many of us do. I was happy to buy her book, if only to support her. I don't regret buying the book for that reason, but it's a bit disappointing. There's a lot of recycled material, and the new material is darker and more introspective. Nothing that made me laugh out loud like the first time I discovered her blog. She gives a wonderful insight into her depression, which is helpful to show to folks that don't understand depression.
1439192812|5.0|I'm a research scientist and even though I already knew all the facts from the book, its still one of my favorites. Buy the hardcover as the graphics are beautiful. Bought it for my 8 year old Godson since I want him to get a good perspective on reality and fiction. He loved it and told his mom at the dinner table that we all come from fish. He was really excited about it.
B003WJQ74E|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. The plot and character development were great, and this is the type of book that leaves you to wonder how/why/what if. The Kindle version was great, no issues like I've seen in some books.
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Returned it.  The connection between the device and my PC kept dropping.  I added the &#34;dongle&#34; as instructued to improve the connection and it still dropped every 2 min or so.  The PC was only 5 feet away if that.  This seems to be another not ready for prime time release from Google.  I don't understand why they launch half baked products.<br /><br />I do not recommend this product.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|As with the other books, I couldn't put this one down. I was a little disappointed at the end. In comparison to the other books, this one  ranks last for me. Oh well, not much going to stop us from finishing the trilogy.
034580404X|4.0|I read all the books. The first two I read really fast. I am still working on the third one. It is a little slow. The excitement slows down.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I have to give this book 3 stars because it's a page turner. I didn't think it was written well. You can definitely tell it's a middle aged women writing out her fantasies. I didn't find the 'juicy' portions of the book to be all that 'juicy' or salacious. Though there's a cliffhanger, I refuse to buy the next book.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|My family listened to this cd all Thanksgiving Day.  We all loved it.  Brings out the Christmas Spirit.  We cannot get enough of the Piano Guys.
B000002B30|5.0|I love Bruce Springsteen's music particularly this CD.  Certain songs that I really love, I will play over and over again because I don't seem to get enough.  Unfortunately, constantly playing a song over and over again I have broken two car CD players.
B00F35B8F8|3.0|Well done but...Cliche, rehash old characters(khan) over the top superhero stunts(spock jump from flying car to flying car), ridiculously easy penetration of secret starship base by Scotty. Star Trek should return to classic sci fi roots of original series(good stories, complemented by action).
B006K2WXOI|5.0|Great story and great artwork!<br />We are going to make our own polar express in my kinder class. Hot chocolate and all!
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|An all around wonderful movie. And I love Hugh Jackman, although everyone is superb in this movie and I was very surprised I loved it so much. I don't usually like this type of movie
0756686970|5.0|My kids love this book!! Big illustrations and lots of fun facts. The book has a durable hardback cover that holds up to all the wear and tear.
B00DXPC1U6|4.0|I loved the entire Dexter series but I am so bummed with this ending and the not knowing what happened in the end
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I have used probably a dozen of these types of apps and only a few actually have seamless looping. This one actually works as advertised. If like me you use these apps to help you sleep it's worth the 2 bucks.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is fantastic, I cant wait to read the 3 third book! I hope they make a 4th one!
B00GX59QO2|5.0|Really good movie. If you like the first one then you will really like this one!  Watched it twice in one night
B0063IH60K|5.0|If you like solitaire this apps for you I play once a day and change the theam with the seasons
B00FEMJF6O|3.0|I Like the game fir the most part buts it takes to much to do certain tasks I would like it better if it was a little easier to make money
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This documentary takes us behind the grocery counter and makes clear why our food choices matter--for ourselves and our food animals.
B004JZBGWI|2.0|I used this for a short time but did not find it easy to use.  There did not seem to be enough help to run it.  I ended up deleting it and looking elsewhere.
B00ET9T2WK|5.0|This game is awesome five star amazing  works real well on kindle  good graphics, upgrades ,and good war format hope you enjoy
B008ASGP3U|5.0|I am a diehard Rankin fan and this book lives up to all my expectations and more. Rankin never disappoints<br />with his complex plots, gritty and fascinating characters and oh, so realistic descriptions of Edinburgh and the east of Scotland.
B00GP0G0IK|4.0|Good game...graphics very good...few glitches that is why 4 stars and not 5...I kept having to restart my kindle fire as I would be kicked out for no apparent reason...I still like the game and recommend it...good puzzles...some took awhile to complete which I like...looking for the next one.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I give this book a 5 out of 5! Very first book of read that both is exciting and hopeful.
B0089EHWQE|5.0|I am not sure I have ever read a more moving story.  I both loved and hated this book.  It made me laugh, it made me cry, and gave me a much deeper understanding for those who have suffered spinal cord injuries.  I don't think the author could have made her characters any more &#34;real.&#34;  This is a love story that will stay with me forever.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|This app really, really, needs an update.  It is functional as is, however.  One might find a web browser to be as useful, or even more useful.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Greatest little box<br />Even better when its 23 dollars after 6 dollar movie credit<br /><br />i now have 3 i am going to hand out for xmas this year
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This is a delightful album and I'm really looking forward to listening to it every day this month with my other Christmas favorites. The Piano Guys have brightened my day many times over the last several years with their beautiful music and videos.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|I had seen the movie trailer while watching a movie with my daughter and I had to have this movie to see and to add to my movie collection. I knew what the movie was about when I saw the trailer but when you actually watch it, this movie will touch your heart and open your eyes up to a dog's loyalty and love. I ask not just dog lovers but all animal lovers to get this movie and watch it.
B003DWU98U|2.0|The movie did not hold my interest. I only watched the first 10 minutes so maybe I did not give it a chance. but I just thought it was a waste of my time.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|It lags a lot so I have to detle the app and get it again it kinda gets annoying but other then that best youtube in the app store :3! I would get it but there is lag! :3  -Skydoesminecraft<br />JK!!! :3
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Held my interest. Good story line. I iike Danzel's movies. He is rich enugh so that he can pass on scripts that are lacking in quality so if you watch one of his movies it is giong to be worth it.
0790743507|5.0|Fun, Fun, Fun! Great comedy along with outstanding singing and dancing. You can't finish watching Singing In the Rain without humming the tune. Great Classic, they don't make movies like this anymore.
B002CMQS1O|5.0|Very funny rockumentary spoof - Nigel Tufnel is the best!  Worth seeing again if you haven't seen in a while...
B00F031X62|3.0|Frankly, I expected more from this set. Other than commemorating the peak of Hendrix's ascendancy following his explosive performance at the Monterey Pop Festival, but much to recommend here. Average at best.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|This book provided me a window into my daughter.  Well researched and well written without being clinical.  I recommend this to anyone who is an introvert, has an introverted child or spouse, or is in a leadership position at work.  Very enlightening.  Confirmed much of what I had already figured out with my daughter.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|What they don't tell you is that -- although touting its small size -- you have to connect it to power and probably as adapter also. I have a laptop with WiDi that can throw my computer screen to my SmartTV without this. and it doesn't work well. I hope to be able to learn to use it better, but as of now it was a waste of money.
0670024856|4.0|Her main character, Alma, was exceptionally written. But, I guess I wished more for her. Exceptional things happened around and through her life, but she never seemed to grab hold of them and overcome. Alma deserved more. However, the narrative was amazing and I learned a lot of the time period.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|not my cup of tea ....I was expecting a more substantial plot but my error is that I purchased and chose to read it based on it's hype before realizing it was not so much a novel as a long piece of erotica.  As such, pretty creative.
B005544TRQ|4.0|Suits is good in spite of being packed to the gills with unrealistic scenarios.  A lot goes on that would never be seen in a law office but that is what TV is all about, isn't it?  The awkward love/hate between Harvey and Mike is saved by Louis.  Louis is one top notch bad person who takes heaps of abuse and yet manages to remain likeable - sort of.
B0001I561E|5.0|I bought this DVD for my four year old (and of course myself). Picture is definitely clear, no issues with the Disc. Would recommend to others.
B009JZSC9S|3.0|As is often the case with television series, The Good Wife is best in the first three seasons.  By season 4, it is clear that the writers are either weary or have moved on and the B team takes their place.  The first half of season 4 is the weakest.  The last four shows show a return to form for most of the characters.  Exception to that is Will Gardner whose character seems very spent, almost superfluous and I can say Diane Lockhart is a little but not much better. Kalinda manages to hold her own but the writers are not doing her any big favors.  Cary and Alicia seem to be the best hope for a better Season 5.
0316228583|4.0|Ok Folks, from a housewife who just loves to read.....here is MY simple review of The Casual Vacancy.  I really enjoyed it.  I found it very thought provoking and real.  It is a look into the lives of several families who are affected by the death of a prominent counsel member.  J. K. Rowling created well rounded characters and intertwined them beautifully.  Sometimes I thought the book was funny, sometimes it was sad, sometimes confusing, shocking, and while some reviewers felt that the end was predictable, I did not see it coming.  I enjoyed seeing the characters evolve, even though it took them, especially the adults, to the END of the book to make positive changes.  I found the story line very real and dealing with issues that are happening in todays world.  I read that many of the reviewers found it too dark and depressing, and felt that J. K. Rowling was attempting to be edgy by throwing in all of these hot button issues....I disagree with that.  The issues in this book, found in this community, are issues found in most communities whether one cares to believe that or not.<br /><br />I suppose this type of book is not for everyone.  If you are the type of person who wants a clear cut story, idea, and an answer at the end, If you want it all spelled out for you then don't waste your time.  If you are the type of person who is a people watcher, who enjoys studying the human condition, and stretching yourself then you will certainly feel rewarded for reading The Casual Vacancy.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I'm hooked line and sinker on The Piano Guys and as usual everything they put out is definately top shelf.  I am however; a little disappointed in the DVD for being so short on video.  I was expecting more live performance on the video.  I mean the well plannede videos are great, but somewhere in there I thought this was supposed to give us a showing of a live performance.  Maybe I read it wrong, but that was what I thought the DVD was.<br /><br />All in all it still is a deal because it just plangood music and a great few videos...
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|I enjoy playing and so do my boys. I enjoy all sorts of hunting and this game gives great opportunity for that.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|wow it keeps me and my family and friends entertained it can get frustrating but you can get different cars and such i recommend you get this application
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Not much of a Christmas music person, but love TPG.  Such a good way to start the season.  Listen to it often and even bought another one for a friend.
B000B589JI|1.0|I hate to give it a two but I have to in order to bring either you, the wanna-buy, and them, the seller/manufacturers to attention.<br /><br />Pros: 1.Nicely designed, looks very cool.<br />  2. Comes with hooks and rings that can be easily attached to any place/device.<br />  3. Holds a decent amount of fuel: enough to fill up a regular zippo once.<br />  4. Have a slot for extra flint as well.<br /><br />CONS: 1. FUEL LEAKS NON-STOP.<br />  -This is a serious problem. No matter how tight I twist the cap the fuel still comes out if positioned upside down or sideways. The rubber ring inside the cap does not really seal it. As a result I cannot put it with my key ring otherwise my pants smells like gas and it makes my hands slippery and smell bad too.<br /><br />In general, I can only hand it at the very end of my backpack otherwise it's useless since no one wants to smell like gas.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br /><br />I had the first one returned to have a replacement, hoping that the second one will arrive working. But I was wrong. The second one still leaks like hell and since I do not want to spend the time and energy or even money on searching for a replacement rubber ring to prevent fuel from leaking. I returned the second for refund.<br /><br />Zippo, if your product cannot withstand your claim that all your products are made with quality, don't sell them. Extremely disappointed.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|Just loved the book! Marcus Zusak really applied a human side to the civilians that lived in Germany during WWII.  This book brought me to tears something no other book as done as I can remember
B009ZAY8MM|5.0|Realized after downloading that I had already downloaded. Amazon ought to have something that asks you...do you really want to download this music again. Love the music but I'm bummed about paying for it twice!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Love this game. I got it to see what all the fuss was about. You don't have to spend money, but I can see how people would to pass some of the more frustrating levels.
B007THA4FI|4.0|I enjoyed this book - it was a bit depressing but well written and engaging. Looking forward to more work from J.K. Rowling
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|need more levels and bonus wheel for kindle. I am on level 463. it goes that high on iphone but not on kindle. I also have bonus wheel on phone but not on kindle. please update. thanks love the game!!!
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Not the best Bond, but well worth watching. Probably one of the best bad guys though. If you are a Bond fan, you will not be disappointed.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's fun but addicting! LOL!!  I get stuck on a level and it takes several trys and waiting for more lives but finally I get thru to next one.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|This is my 4 year old grand-daughters favorite movie. Every time I see her or talk to her on the phone she asks me where Kevin (the colorful bird) is. Just a sweet and sometimes funny story about an elderly man and a lonely boy.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is such a great game. You won't regret downloading this game app. I enjoy playing this for hours. So realistic..
B000NYT1M6|5.0|My kid loves all things Bruder.  I have a 6 year old son, he is into trucks, cranes, all types of large equipment and machinery.  His favorites are his Bruder things.  They are a little costly (I'm a single mom and $50 for a play truck for a 6 yo is expensive to me) but he treats them like GOLD.  The doors open, the dump part dumps, everything does what it would do in real life except crank.  I would highly highly recommend this and every other Bruder brand truck to anybody with a little truck lover, he or she will be in heaven.  I do wish it were metal, but I reckon that is just because I am out of the times.  The plastic is sturdy though.  And either way, he LOVES it.<br /><br />PS- He has the crane and a few of the smaller tractors in addition to this dump truck, some of the better toys I've got him.

B00AF6MF9I|2.0|This program often glitches. I have lost money after buying items because a glitch caused the item to be lost. I had this program before and hoped that this sort of thing was fixed but apparently it hasn't been.
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|it used to work great with little or no problems ... but now unfortunately it stops after the loading screen... oh well. great game tho if I could play it
B00BD99JMW|5.0|i was in shock after I finished this book. the author did such a phenomenal job that i hated it. and loved it.
B000YDI9UG|5.0|I usually wear a 12 or 13. These boots run WAY large. I had to order them twice to find a good size. I ended up getting size 11 and they are still a little too big. A size 10 would probably be perfect. highly recommend these boots though. I talk about them all the time. Boots boots boots.
B004J64QSI|5.0|Great cast and staging!  The finale with some of the original actors was unbelievable - I'd recommend this to anyone who has seen Les Mis on stage or on film!

B009SJ3H8Q|3.0|While the Asylum was good it rates well below the first season. The genius of the first season was that it was scary, but you could relate and care for the characters. In this season, it was so crazy, and dark I couldn't get into it as much.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I LOVE this CD. It's easy listening that the entire family from 85 to 8 months love. I wish they had another Christmas CD and that they toured during the holiday time but the awesome videos help out!
B007SGM084|5.0|I generally didn't know what to expect from this book since I \\"heard\\" it was hot and steamy and frankly,  it seemed like everyone was extremely hot and bothered by these \\"controversial books\\" so I wasn't too sure I even wanted to read  it or that I'd even LIKE them because I was intending on PURCHASING the whole trilogy bundle, I either read all of it or none of it.. But, alas, curiosity succumbed aaand I bought them. As far as the sex part, it's okay, my-my Mr. Grey is very kinky LOL but it's nothing too crazy (I've read far worse I'm sorry to say) and no, it's not porn.<br />The REAL underlying story though-- it's beautiful, shows how LOVE (and lust for that matter haha) saved two people, one more than the other.. It's a beautiful story and a beautiful ending.. I laughed at the quirky remarks and gasped at the shocking ones.. I believe it's a very good trilogy despite what others might have said and written and I commend Miss E.L. James for taking these controversial issues on (sex and love) and writing about them..<br />I'll be honest and say that I'll miss Miss Anastasia Steele, I mean Mrs. Anastasia Grey and the ever-so-sexy Christian Grey.. This is one of those trilogies that after you've completed reading them, you're left with the thought of: \\"Well, NOW what do I do with my life,\\" Hahaha these books consume you, they're good though..
B00EEDNA4M|5.0|This item was released on November 26, 2013....just one week ago. It is already sold out nearly everywhere....including Amazon.com. Obviously everyone knew it would be a popular item....and with Christmas approaching, it is no wonder that it is sold out. I am surprised that more of this item was not manufactured so that the manufacturer would make more money. Instead, Amazon Marketplace and eBay sellers are selling this item for exorbitant amounts of money. Does anyone know if the item will be available once again....in the barrel with all of the same extras....before or after Christmas....or are all the rest of us who were not able to order it out of luck?
B00GIZO674|5.0|I absolutely love this game. It kills time when waiting for my son Trac practice to end .I will be buying the full version.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|My only issue is the bombardment of in app purchases. It makes you wait 10 min for your gun upgrades to be &quot;delivered&quot;, but you can pay more to get it now.
0385340540|5.0|Fantastic read mainly because I just returned from Bologna.  Loved all the local references.  A page turner as always from Grisham.
0385537131|5.0|I enjoy all of Grisham's books - the suspense, the law situations, his characters. And they are set in the South, many in Mississippi, where I live/
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|addicting but is making me mad Cuz I been stuck on level 76 for almost 3 weeks. also when someone sends me extra moves how do I get to use them?
B000V6I7WG|5.0|One of the best imports I've seen. This is a cult classic for sure!  Have watched more of this directors films since seeing this movie, very talented.
B00AEFY5TI|5.0|i liked the movie i have whiched this movie ofr years and every time i see it i like that much more
B001NLL93W|4.0|I really enjoyed this book! It sums up the series nicely. I am still on the fence as to if I will read books 4, 5, & 6, because this book does a wonderful job answering all my questions. Cassandra Clare did an excellent job on the momentum and the action in the book. It keeps you turning the pages.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Think of how hard it would be if you did all of that. I for one would not even volunteer, love Percy Jackson( as a cool guy). And Rick Riordan
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|It was in John Grisham style page turners,  intriguing, a bit formulaic and predictable with southern racial overtones, timed exposure of characters hidden secrets.  If you want a quick read, have some time to kill,so to speak, pick it up, you won't be disappointed.
B00F91RYL8|3.0|It's alright for a pg 13 zombie flick. Although in the first 45 minutes of the movie, they shove so much in your face, combined with the shaky cam, can be too much on the eyes. Their was so much going on at once that my eyes just couldn't keep up. Also one thing that really felt useless in this movie was Brad Pitt's family. If they were to die or not be shown in the movie at all, nothing would change.
0804161380|5.0|This collection is OUTSTANDING in terms of quality and appearance.  Over the years, I have purchased most of these guides and got the additional materials that were included with them (though these were not replicated for the guides in this collection unfortunately).  If ever you were looking for a nice collection of books concerning The Legend of Zelda or to aid in completing the games, this set is DEFINITELY for you.<br /><br />PROS:<br /><br />1)  Quality:  The outer box resembles a treasure chest, the likes of which Link finds all across Hyrule (and many other worlds connected to it).  It is a sturdy cardboard coated with a gloss-like finish, and it seems to have a magnetic clasp built in to keep the top closed.  On the roof of the top, when opened, is a slot containing a metallic (yes, metallic, not vinyl or cardboard) bookmark that has been beautifully etched by what appears to be laser.  It contains the logo of the series on one side and the crest of the Royal Family of Hyrule on the other, making for a very attractive (and unexpectedly greater quality) bookmark.  The books themselves all appear to be of slightly better quality than their original prints (which had binding problems and easily tore in some instances).<br /><br />2)  Additional Goodies:  The most obvious additional item (and most sought after in time I am sure) would be the guide for Ocarina of Time 3D, which is only available through this set (of which only 50,000 exist).  I have examined it, and it is a VERY nice guide for the game, and as beautifully put together as its companion guides.  Another obvious extra is the metallic bookmark, which is really one of the nicest bookmarks I have seen honestly.  Also, something else extra that may be easy to miss is this:  some of the materials in this print of the guides have been expanded upon (the number of pages in Skyward Sword's guide has increased by 100 if that tells you anything).<br /><br />3)  Collectible Status:  The set comes with a certificate of authenticity that includes a stamped number out of 50,000 and with the printed message and signature of Eiji Aonuma.  It marks the set as one out of 50,000 which indicates its collectible status and will almost certainly indicate an increase in value as time goes on.<br /><br />4)  Packaging:  I have NEVER seen such good packaging for any item I have bought online as I have for this one.  The box the collection was shipped in is a good middle size containing two foam-like holding pieces that fit onto each end of the chest/box which hold it in place (and suspend it both above the shipping box's bottom and below the shipping box's top) and ensures that the package will not move around inside the shipping box at all during transport.  I intend to keep the shipping box and packaging the collection came in to transport it again when I am ready to move.  You can definitely rest assured that the collection will not suffer damage during shipping.<br /><br />CONS:<br /><br />1)  Lack of Previous Additional Materials:  As indicated before, the previous materials included with the previous print of these guides were not included, nor the map from the recently released Wind Waker HD guide.  This is a small complaint, as Twilight Princess's guide originally came with a cloth map of Hyrule, the Phantom Hourglass guide came with a vinyl bookmark of its own, and the Spirit Tracks guide originally came with a printed map of Hyrule.  While this is a regrettable exclusion, one should also take note that those materials were fairly cheaply made.  Hence, you're not missing out on much in that regard.<br /><br />2)  Exclusion of ALBW Guide:  It is a shame that the makers of the collection did not have the foresight to include the recently released collector's guide for A Link Between Worlds in this collection, and considering they came out basically at the same time they easily could have.  This is a minor complaint, as the guide for A Link Between Worlds is of course availablefor purchase and comes with a collector's lithograph of the primary image from A Link Between Worlds.  Still, it would have been nice to have gotten them all together in one fell swoop, though of course this would have increased the size and weight of the package even more than it already is (and trust me, it weighs a good amount).<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:  This is an AWESOME set that will make any collector ecstatic to possess for not only its vast wealth of knowledge concerning the games it covers, but also for its beauty, craftsmanship and quality.  If you have not already gotten these guides, I STRONGLY encourage you to pick up this set while you are able to (there are only 50,000 in existence).  And if you have already gotten some of these guides as I had, I encourage you to still pick up this set and possibly sell your older copies as I plan to.  I plan to keep the extras that came with the previous printings of the guides and sell the guides themselves, as I now have this collection and no longer have any need for them.  The mere inclusion of the Ocarina of Time 3D guide (which apparently is not going to be released outside this set according to the publishers) alone should be a pretty good reason to get this collection, and after seeing it in person, I couldn't agree more that it was indeed worth it.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a WONDERFUL book!!  Well-written, compelling, and gives a touching insight into the Holocaust and Nazi Germany.  I highly recommend it.
0763639184|5.0|This was my grandsons favorite book. When he was just under a year he would point to the baby fish on each page as we read the book. He would hunt and hunt for each baby fish. I just loved reading it to him. Now I have bought one for each of the other 3 grandsons.
B005CRQ2IU|5.0|Just re-watched the movie and it is an amazing adaptation. I think I like the ending of the movie more than the novel.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|Love this movie, my only regret is I should have bought the HD one instead of the 780HD The story is really good especially the part of the song number The Name Game!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Love the piano guys!!!! I listen to them every single day. I haven't met anyone who doesn't like them. They are perfect for the whole family.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Give it a couple chapters then you can't put it down. The author is spectacular and does not let the story linger, every page is worth reading.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|Gorgeous, amazing, beautiful, wonderful movie. Loved how the story was told. I had to have his music as soon as the film was over and purchased it on amazon. I received a cd in the mail a few days later but after my purchased I got a link to download the music digitally for free! Loved that!<br /><br />Sixto Rodriquez is a gem, a wonderful human being and you NEED to see his story. It will make you have more faith in humanity.
B00BPDR3F6|3.0|This book is interesting and amusing. It convinces me that I need to<br />Read Darwin's book, which I never expected. A bit rushed at the end, but a worthwhile read.
B0058YPL66|5.0|All the characters are excellent for their roles in this series, I'm waiting until they find out who they really are, so second season here I come.
B0001US62I|5.0|this movie reminds me of the skeleton key.  I can usually figure them out long before the movie is over but this one it finally hit me 3/4 through the movie... its like that ah ha then you sit and say see I knew that was going to happen.  Then of course the family gets a little upset.  This movie is a great thriller. not suitable for young children under the age of 17
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Love the Piano Guys! I gave this to my husband and daughter as a family gift after Thanksgiving and we have listened to the CD many times already and have watched the DVD as well. Excellent!
B00CF34B2I|2.0|I like many others had it almost brick my kindle fire HD.  Thankfully, o found  a few fixes. 1. Delete it from the cloud and tells your kindle yo check its storage.(only works if connected to internet).  Second if you have file explorer, then go to  the android folder then go-to the Amazon.venzia folder, then to the file folder and then open the all folder and delete the apks.  I didn't try this but hi could possibly connect your kindle to your computer and remove on the computer.
B005I548B4|5.0|This book is quite easily the best book I have EVER read. I was hooked right from the beginning and it was one of those &#34;just one more page... just one more chapter... I'll just read till the plot calms down again&#34; type books. I also cried like a baby while reading it (a big thing for me to cry at all at a book) and it took me a long time to get over this book and move onto another one since it really does grip you and leave a lasting impression. Highly recommend it!
B0000UN25A|5.0|If you liked Joe Cocker in 1968 his music only gets better, a really good mix, glad I bought it.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|This is a great case for a great price! I really loved having this case on my iPhone 4S. Too bad the 5S case isn't as nice.<br /><br />I really enjoyed the simple design and the cutouts for the buttons.<br /><br />I dropped my phone a couple of times with this case on, and it was none the worse for the wear.
B00CE03UOC|4.0|Fun way to pass the time and figuring out some of the boards is challenging.  Please keep more puzzles coming.
B00BAXFACO|5.0|If Michael Connelly wrote music I would play the records until the grooves wore out.  The reader is never confused or subjected to graphic violence.  His stories have a regular cast of characters with believable dialogue.  His stories are all different and parts will stay with the reader.<br />I will re-read this book.
B00ESY7QXI|1.0|I couldn't even get through it.  The original movie was so much better, this won was all flash and no emotion / story, rather boring actually. I didn't even finish it.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I hope it won't be another 5 years for the next book!  Martin knows how to keep his audience entralled
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I am big Downton Abbey fan. Don't feel like I should say much, lest I give something away, but each episode is just so touching and sweet.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Saw this movie in IMAX and loved it and the BluRay is no slouch.  Picture is beautiful and this package is stacked!
B002PMPTIO|5.0|I have always been a huge star trek fan.  My husband took me to the theater to see this on the big screen when it came out, and later said that he enjoyed watching my face light up every time a new 'old' character came into play!
B00GIZO674|4.0|Good, game, fun and exciting. I dont like the options to upgrade the food category, thats why it gets 4 stars, other than that fast paced time management game, that you will enjoy!
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I like zombie movies, but didn't know whether this made for tv zombie show would be any good.  I watched it and still watch it with surprise and delight.
B000N6TX1I|4.0|Good movie. Great idea that I expected more out of from the reviews. Still well worth watching though I give it 3.5 stars.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a great app!!  It's fun and addictive!!  I've been waiting for this to be available for the kindle fire forever!!  Glad to have it!!
B00GLX0Z8C|5.0|This is the absolutely BEST comedy I have EVER watched!!!! I'd give it 20 stars if I could. You will LOVE IT!!!
B000QCS9NM|4.0|This is a must read for Palahniuk fans.  Although it was a little hard to get into, it ended up being a good story with a nice lesson to be learned.
B000GM4X0A|1.0|Only received 8 out of the 9 books I ordered! These were gifts. I would like the other book I ordered. I've never had any problems until now with ordering on amazon.
B009329ZF2|2.0|It was a really stupid plot despite some good cgi special effects. Basically was a waste of time and laughable.
B00H1O3Q18|5.0|Fantastic series. Gut-wrenching. Thrilling moments of joy offset by pain and anguish and the never ending chase for supplies.<br /><br />Episode eight was the best one yet. It proves humans are worse than the zombies in their lust for greed, power, revenge-all in a world gone mad. You won't regret watching this series. Not a one of em is bad.
0897502027|5.0|A great book overall. Definitely one of the most beneficial books I've picked up in some time! Informative and life changing!
B005LAIGP0|4.0|Being a fan of the Harry Potter movies, I wanted to see Daniel in another role. This isn't the best movie I have ever seen, but I enjoyed it.
0307743721|5.0|Alice Monro continues to be on of my favorite authors.  I enjoy reading short stories, and I have always found Alice Monro's outstanding. Her settings, characters and observations come to life and are poignant...which is the crux of a good short story.
B00FRMDH7Y|5.0|Great family friendly movie. No really bad negativity that I can think of. My three and two year old love this movie!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game where you can build your imagention. It's like playing with legos but on a electric  divisive.
B003WUYRGI|3.0|The book is good but I'm not that smart. But I don't read. I love it it helps me learn.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|I am thoroughly enjoying this book--It reads like a novel-lots of information, adventure, fun.  I recently reintroduced myself to running and for the first time actually look forward to rather than dread my runs.  The concept of natural running never made sense to me-but now it does.  This book is inspiring and &#34;hope building&#34;--makes one believe that anyone can & should run...
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Just purchased this from a brick and mortar store. Love, Love, Love The Piano Guys! Their music fills me with joy and always makes me smile. Love attending their concerts, also. Never pass one up!
B00FR0GT9Y|5.0|Between the lawsuits and the passing of Delp, I didn't think Boston would continue to &#34;walk on&#34;. The new album is exactly what it should be, a migration to a new phase in the band's existence. In my opinion, this is some real quality Boston that can be enjoyed over and over again! Keep it going Tom!
B00BLRXDTQ|3.0|I can't find any info if it has English subtitles or not...do anyone know about that? Thanks...<br />I love movies, yes, but haven't brought to own yet...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I loved this book!!! The suspense in the love quarrel the thoughts of losing someone you love, or having someone you love loathe you... Amazing
B004G6009U|4.0|I like this, very different from other Disney movie. Princess is not too 'ladylike' or 'spoiled' but will fight for her own, strong, hardhead, I like it very much!
B005LAIIN0|5.0|When I saw the trailers for this film it looked like one giant explosion after another with massive hoardes of zombies at every corner and Michael Bay ooze all over every frame.  In fact, I really had no desire to see the film at all, despite the fact that the source material was said to be an inspired work.  When news broke that the film didn’t really follow the book, it kind of solidified in me a reason to stay far away, and then the film itself was delayed (which is usually a bad sign) and with my wife opposed to all things zombies I didn’t have to worry about her Brad Pitt obsession to force me into a theater.<br /><br />I wish that I had seen this on the big screen.<br /><br />Yes, despite no real desire to see this at all, friends talked it up and so I wound up renting this the other night and I have to say, I loved this.<br /><br />Like, a lot.<br /><br />It takes something special for an action film to win me over in this way.  Yes, I enjoy the genre, but most of the films that come out of it are so generic and formulaic and redundant that you need only see one or two of them in a year, despite the fact that a good fifty are made each year.  They just keep coming and coming.  Zombies are all the rage now, but I have yet to see a single episode of ‘The Walking Dead’ and the last great zombie film I saw was Boyle’s masterpiece ’28 Days Later’, and that was way back in 2003.  Needless to say, I wasn’t anticipating much from this, even with my friend’s heavy praise.<br /><br />Where ‘World War Z’ succeeds is in the staging.  I brilliantly makes this more than an explosive mess of chaotic jump scenes.  Instead, it balances out the action with true suspense, keeping the audience in true fear, not manufactured terror.  I can’t stress enough how rewarding this was.  I prefer a film that can get under my skin as opposed to one that throws everything in your face, and this film’s laboratory scene is one of the scariest in recent memory.<br /><br />The film follows an epidemic that reaches global proportions and threatens to wipe out the world.  Gerry Lane, a former UN employee, gets semi-forced back into service when a young kid with a bright idea needs a transport to Japan.  Things get muddled and soon Gerry finds himself mankind’s only hope (sort of) so he travels the globe in search of the answers to stopping this disease transforming the world into undead.<br /><br />Yes, there are some really big scenes here.  There are some breakneck paced sequences that show countless zombies racing down streets and clambering all over one another in order to feast.  They slam into buildings and cars and tear into flesh and they basically clutter the screen.  But those scenes are not what ‘World War Z’ is about, at least not entirely.  There are many softer, smaller, quieter, scarier scenes that make this a very strong addition to the genre.  The plane sequence is breathtaking, and I already mentioned the lab scene, which is the best in the film.  The character development is minimal, but I like that the film doesn’t shy away from taking a harsh approach to the situation.  The ending could be deemed a cop out, and yet it is a lot better than magically curing the world.<br /><br />In fact, this film kind of reminds me of what would happen if you took Boyle’s ‘28 Days Later’, fused it with ‘Contagion’ and gave it a glossy, Michael Bay, veneer.<br /><br />In other words; this film is VERY entertaining.epidemic that reaches global proportions and threatens to wipe out the world.  Gerry Lane, a former UN employee, gets semi-forced back into service when a young kid with a bright idea needs a transport to Japan.  Things get muddled and soon Gerry finds himself mankind’s only hope (sort of) so he travels the globe in search of the answers to stopping this disease transforming the world into undead.<br /><br />Yes, there are some really big scenes here.  There are some breakneck paced sequences that show countless zombies racing down streets and clambering all over one another in order to feast.  They slam into buildings and cars and tear into flesh and they basically clutter the screen.  But those scenes are not what ‘World War Z’ is about, at least not entirely.  There are many softer, smaller, quieter, scarier scenes that make this a very strong addition to the genre.  The plane sequence is breathtaking, and I already mentioned the lab scene, which is the best in the film.  The character development is minimal, but I like that the film doesn’t shy away from taking a harsh approach to the situation.  The ending could be deemed a cop out, and yet it is a lot better than magically curing the world.<br /><br />In fact, this film kind of reminds me of what would happen if you took Boyle’s ‘28 Days Later’, fused it with ‘Contagion’ and gave it a glossy, Michael Bay, veneer.<br /><br />In other words; this film is VERY entertaining.
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|I never used the Evernote. I no longer have it on my tablet. I never used it period therefore I cannot like or hate it.
B00G7QPXUI|4.0|Woody Allen has been a constant force in films since he started making them, for nearly six decades.  While he fluctuates tones and has created masterpieces in both comedy and drama (and some a pure fusion of both), his style is never misrepresented and both genres feel very ‘Woody Allen’ when all is said and done.  In other words; you know a Woody Allen film when you see one.  This is far from a bad thing, especially since Woody uses enough diversity in his tones, themes and subjects to create unique visions all their own.  Sure, he’s had his repetitious moments, but overall he has more good than bad (the bad is sure to come when you make as many movies as Allen has) and has created a consistent career that is not only respected but beloved.<br /><br />During the aughts, it was thought that Woody was reaching this point in his career where nothing was working as strongly or as fluidly as before.  He was being criticized more than praised and his films just were not making the impact they did in the previous decades.<br /><br />He was hitting a slump.<br /><br />Then he put out ‘Match Point’ and the world cried “Woody Allen comeback” and he was back in the spotlight.  ‘Scoop’ was a critical hiccup, but ‘Vicky Cristina Barcelona’ gave him more love, but it was 2011’s ‘Midnight in Paris’ that suddenly made Woody Allen relevant again.  I, personally, didn’t think the movie was that wonderful (I do consider ‘Vicky Cristina Barcelona’ to be a modern masterpiece), but the world did not agree with me and Woody Allen once again found himself an Oscar winner.<br /><br />With this year’s ‘Blue Jasmine’ he has done it again.<br /><br />Is it just me, or does Woody Allen seem to be on a ‘good film/bad film’ kind of role here?  Just a point of interest, or discussion, but this seems to be a pattern.<br /><br />Anyways, let’s talk about ‘Blue Jasmine’.<br /><br />Now, ‘Blue Jasmine’ is not perfect, and it is far from Allen’s best work (it doesn’t hold a candle to ‘Vicky Cristina Barcelona’ or his 80’s work for that matter) but it holds a certain sense of importance and sheer engagement over the audience.  Most of this is due to Cate Blanchett’s tour-de-force performance as the emotionally and mentally unstable Jasmine, but Woody’s biting wit and way with dialog certainly does it’s fair share of spellbinding.<br /><br />The story is told in fragments as the action shifts from present to past and back again.  We see Jasmine’s marriage and wealth unfold and crumble and then see her current state of wellness take a turn for the better, seemingly, as she tries to rebuild her life with her adopted sister Ginger.<br /><br />On the one hand, we have the story of Jasmine’s marriage to wealthy businessman and philandering crook Hal.  Jasmine is selfish, snooty and smothered in jewelry, furs and designer bags.  Her husband sleeps with everything that moves, and does so under the ignorance (possibly intentional) of his doting wife.  Behind the scenes, Hal is stealing money, and while others suspect it, Jasmine decides to ignore it.<br /><br />We shoot forward to after Hal’s arrest, suicide and Jasmine’s destitution.  She has no money and is forced to move in with her sister Ginger, who lives in San Francisco.  The two have not been close for years, mainly due to Jasmine’s arrogance and refusal to embrace her sister and her seeming low standards.  Jasmine hated her first husband, resented her lack of means and finds her sense of humor embarrassing.  Now though, she needs to lean on someone.  She moves in, which upsets Ginger’s boyfriend Chili (who was planning on moving in with her) and so he is quick to try and get Jasmine to move on with her life.  The problem is, the stress has caused Jasmine to suffer a nervous breakdown and so her material loss is not her only obstacle.<br /><br />She is going crazy.<br /><br />There are no easy answers in ‘Blue Jasmine’.  The finale doesn’t feel like a conclusion but more like a cliffhanger as we are left to wonder exactly where Jasmine is going to end up.  Will she ever pull herself together?  Will she ever find happiness?  Is she destined to become a crazy park bench cat lady who talks to herself and is made fun of by passersby?  While the film offer no easy answers, it does offer up a lot of easy (or maybe I should say ‘lazy’) observations.  I have two criticisms of this film (just two) and this is the first one.  All those claiming that ‘Fruitvale Station’ was too obvious really should watch this film and see what obvious is all about.  The browbeating of ‘the grass is not always greener on the other side’ and ‘money is the root of all evil’ is VERY dominant here and it bleeds into every subplot.  Making this all the more obvious is the stereotypical treatment of every man in the film (my second criticism).  By giving no depth to Hal, Chili, Al, Dr. Flicker or Dwight (Augie is an exception), Woody Allen failed to completely flesh out his themes in a way that felt more than one-sided.  I’ve had this issue with Allen before (my major complaint with ‘Husbands and Wives’ was that it felt completely one-sided and lacked shared responsibility).<br /><br />Still, these complaints do not take away entirely from the film.  They merely knock it down from a superb film to a merely great one.<br /><br />Blanchett weaves through Allen’s dialog with so much ease, and she filters her emotional fluctuations with a brilliant sense of raw honesty.  This is clearly one of her finest moments and it may be one of Allen’s greatest character creations as well.  The fragility and hardness meld together into this explosive presence that one will not soon forget.  Her monologues, her mental frailties, her hysterical breakdowns; all of them could have veered into camp and yet her handling of every moment feels so grounded in Woody’s themes and tones that she feels honest and relatable.  You can believe her.  Sally Hawkins is also stupendous here.  She is the perfect counterbalance to Blanchett.  She makes Ginger feel earnest and genuine in her concern and her growing insecurities and doubts.  As Jasmine unloads judgment on her, she begins to question her life choices and you bite into every question in her eyes.<br /><br />My only wish is that the sea of tremendous male talent was used to better effect.  Alec Baldwin, Michael Stuhlbarg and Bobby Cannavale are mere caricatures.  While it is nice to see Peter Sarsgaard step away from playing a sleazy jerk, he is given like three scenes and he’s swallowed by Blanchett in every one.  Louis C.K. could have developed something special, but his screen time is also very limited.  Andrew Dice Clay is the only man here to rise above and give us something that feels three dimensional.  While his scenes are few, you can feel the earthy rawness of this man who is gruff on the outside yet extremely human underneath.<br /><br />At the end of the day, I really enjoyed this despite my reservations.  I wish that it hadn’t been so obvious in its message and yet, the good here outweighs the bad in my eyes.ale doesn’t feel like a conclusion but more like a cliffhanger as we are left to wonder exactly where Jasmine is going to end up.

B00CLL1UY6|5.0|Another fine work by author Christoph Fischer. In this work we find ourselves in the chaotic times pre WWI Vienna. The author brings us in and captures us with the issues of the day. The pending war, personal issues, infections and amputations. A whirlwind of real life, decisions that have to be made. some life threatening. The author walks us through the road of life. Christoph brings us well developed chararcters. A mix of human emotions is sure to follow us through untill the end.  Which in the end this is a story of courage, hope and love. A well thought out story and gives us images and description that will stick to us.

6305882592|4.0|Harold is a young guy, maybe 20. Maude is 80 or so. They meet at a funeral for someone neither of them knows, and their friendship grows from there. Although it appears at times the movie might be about to take a kinky turn, it doesn't. That might be a mild spoiler, but it's one that might encourage some to watch it!<br /><br />These two lonely souls simply enjoy one another's company. And that is what the movie is about: a May and December friendship between two quite unusual people during the late 60's with all the trimmings!
0385537131|3.0|I was really into this book in the beginning but as it progressed, I found it repetitive, slow and somewhat boring. I actually had a problem keeping track of all the characters as Grisham jumped around.  I definitely did not like the ending!  Personally, I think he is just another burned out author who is running out of good ideas for a book.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|Fresh SK is always a treat! I won't go into much regarding the novel itself, but will only compare it to the original, which is one of my favorites. I think this one held up well, and offered a new concept in villains. Also, it was nice to revisit the old story, with Danny as an adult. While I loved the book, and recommend it highly, I am only giving it four stars because it was not quite up there with The Shining. Guess its unfair to rate a book this way, but it helps me keep the true five star reads as an exclusive category. Actually, if we could rate half stars as well, I'd give this a 4.5 any day. Regardless, it was a fine book and well worth your time.
B00FX8FQ76|5.0|This is a great album, thought out, fun, good mix and different from a lot of music out now.  Loved it!

B000000IS2|5.0|Great sound to a classic 70's Elvis record. I simply love this album. If you have never owned it, you need to.
B00EVW0SA0|2.0|At times funny and enjoyable but about 45 minutes too long.  I always enjoy Channing Tatum, but even he couldn't save this movie from the stupid plot holes, cliches, and the unbearable length of the movie.  I also get tired of the angry teen who is mad at the hero.  Can't some movies have kids who like their fathers? I realize they were going for the whole redemption thing, but it seemed tiresome and made the teenage girl instantly dislikable, even though her character turned out to be pretty good, it took me forever to warm up to her because she was such a little snot in the beginning of the movie.
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|This is an amazing album. I'm a really classically oriented person--old school--and a clergyman--I love this really fresh approach--and I recognize the real talent here. Great album.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love this game. I enjoy it and I can also have children play it also and its not that hard for them
B00BEWCJFM|5.0|Excellent I have most of their live albums available. Great tracks and the musicianship is really prominent on this one..check it  out if you are already a fan you will love this one.
B00FR0GT9Y|3.0|Not a bad album... roughly on par with Corporate America. Overall it's a bit uneven and lacks the cohesiveness and more polished production of the first four albums. While the songs are somewhat hit-or-miss, the distinctive BOSTON sound can still be found on several tracks, most notably on the excellent title track &#34;Life, Love & Hope&#34; as well as two of the better songs from this offering: &#34;Heaven on Earth&#34; and &#34;The Way You Look Tonight&#34;.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Definitely good book especially if you like things that have to do with racing. Good story line. Involves racing, dog and heart. What else could a man want. Read it you will enjoy.

B0027BOL4G|5.0|Apart from being a good (and interesting) movie, this movie came in the mail really quickly! (I was pretty surprised by that).  Also,  the movie arrived in great condition, so if you don't already own the movie, I suggest buying it considering how affordable it is.

B00BAXFECK|4.0|A great balance between an easy read and a thought-provoking intellectual novel. A coming of age under difficult circumstances book.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Incredibly satisfying story which I marathoned during my first 48 hours of ownership. Such a fun return to the world of the Shining. Thank you, Meister King.
B00A6L78YE|1.0|This is quite possibly the most overrated album I've ever heard.  It is so derivative and sophomoric that it's virtually unlistenable.  To the folks who gave this thing such high ratings: so sorry you missed out on the excellent artists from whom this pathetic art forger stole his entire repertoire.
B009EEQMZK|5.0|Way better than the book!!  The books go on and on with endless unnecessary details.  The author creates a good story, but it takes too long to get there.  This movie was too the point, and entertaining.<br /><br />Wish I had started here, and skipped the books.
B0063IH60K|4.0|my earlier version froze after nearly 2 years so I downloaded this new version. I wish that it kept the navigation bar at the bottom instead of having to prompt it back up

0451213092|5.0|A Follett book, the best ,the best buy all of his books all good reads. can't wait for his next book.
B00DERIV8Y|4.0|This is the first Walking Dead figure I have bought. When I saw it I had to get it. I haven't bought the smaller Walking Dead figures McFarlane have released because they don't look anything like the actual actors. Especially Rick and Daryl. But they did really good with this 10 inch figure of Daryl. Looks just like him. Has a lot of detail. This is a must for any Walking Dead fan. But there's a reason I gave him 4 stars. He does not stand at all! No matter what I try he just falls over. I had to use one of my stands that came my square enix figures so he doesn't fall.<br /><br />The crossbow was a pain to get in his hand. Took me a while and it still doesn't fit all the way.<br /><br />So you may have to get a stand for him if you buy him. Also when you start looking at him be VERY careful with him. Especially the arrows for the cross bow. McFarlane figures have a history of breaking very easily. I've had many break pulling them out of package or moving their joints. And I was very careful with them. So just take your time when you move his arms. They can be stiff when you first open the figure. Jus go slow. Overall he's a cool figure minus those issues. I definitely recommend him for collectors. Not for playing with!
0451147960|5.0|another one of Ken Follett books, buy it, best writer ever. He does not need me or anyone to push his books, anything with his name on it buy it.
006056251X|4.0|casme in good condition and it was a really good book to read and i liked it when i was reading it
B00008O31H|5.0|I like there music, in the mist of collecting, all of there music. You look at these guys and say what! and to believe that they put out that kind of sound, just blows my mind. There old stuff is just as good as as the stuff there putting out today.

B007SGM084|4.0|I loved the love story that developed between Christian and Anastasia. I got bored with the sex parts in the book. Loved all the drama and the way it ended. Can't wait for the movie.
B0002O06N0|5.0|Hey there good. I like there old music, just as much as there new. Keep giving me more and i will buy more.Thanks Black Keys.
8866137634|5.0|Yes Yes Yes. This is an awesome notebook, well made as are all Moleskines. The cover is a bit overboard, but the paper is good, the lines are clear enough to see, and the Evernote Page Camera works pretty well. Now, my handwriting is pretty poor, so it doesn't always OCR things properly, but that's a small loss in my book.<br /><br />The three free months of Evernote Premium are great and make this a great value if you're already a premium member.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|We love this album. It was the first music I put on this year. I really love all the songs.
B000002H4C|5.0|Great mix of bands. Sammy Hagar's best song. One of Blue Oyster Cult's best songs. Classic! Had My brother had the cassette back then and I always played it. Ahh the good ole' days.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This is quickly becoming my latest favorite Christmas album, the music is absolutely beautiful!  This a great album to listen to at work too, purely beautiful relaxing music for the whole family.  A must have this season.
B007WOC4GK|5.0|My 4-yr old son loved the story.  It's imaginative and really a nice story on finding something positive in a situation, even though it might not be what you were looking for.
B00BFIFIPS|5.0|My son loves everything about this case.  Color, slim fit, protective-ness.  All around good buy!  Would recommend in a heartbeat.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is great for those that like puzzles and having your brain worked out while killing some time.  The game has an excellent rise in difficulty as you progress through the levels. I fully recommend this great brain teaser.
B003568FR6|5.0|When I got this video I knew I wasn't in shape even though I didn't have a problem with my weight but I was not expecting this to kick my butt! I really love this workout, its easy enough for beginners but she does make you sweat and work to get your body looking great. I use to not like working out because it was boring and I didn't have that much time so this was really great for me. I would definitely recommend this video.
B000S1M9LY|5.0|Absolutely fantastic! Get to page 200-250 when it starts coming together, the rest is a breeze. OK not really but it does get a lot easier.
B008Q0AJA2|1.0|How did this end up in my in-basket.  I would never, ever watch this claptrap tripe.  This is visual dysentery.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This fan is great. It was simple to install, and it keeps my CPU temperatures very cool under heavy loads. I recommend it to anyone looking to keep upgrade their stock CPU fan.
B004RC8NUQ|2.0|This film should succeed better than it does. Both Portman and Kutchner can be enchanting when provided with the right comic script, the right director, and the right film editor. To be sure, there are scenes of amusing potential. In one of them, when Kutchner wakes up--in someone else’s apartment with no memory of the previous night’s events--he tries to determine, by questioning everyone who passes through the room (both male and female), if that person had been his bedmate. Such a scene can be very funny indeed. But in this one, all four actors are restrained by uncertain, cautious, self-conscious direction and tedious editing.<br /><br />Fraternity jokes about straight sex (“Can I finger you?”) and gay sex (“I hear they’re tunnel buddies”) don’t belong in romantic comedy. The film is packed with them. No Strings Attached seems more like a second-year film-school assignment than a Hollywood movie.The actors must have been embarrassed to watch it, if they watched it at all.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I can think of only one word to define this movie - ACTION!  If you haven't seen it, I would have to ask - WHY?
B00FQAZ7PW|5.0|Great album.  A little more mellow than previous albums, but that is not a bad thing at all.  Amazing that this band is going on over 20 years and still making great music. Lots of great tracks on this album.
B00DHPN7G4|4.0|Currently I play on the highest sensitivity on most games but needed something to slow down twitch and reaction shots. Saw these on Amazon and decided to try them out. The whites didn't do enough and the blacks kept preventing me from moving my stick all the way to the edge as it would get pinched between the head of the joystick and the controller. Put on the yellow and works great. Would definitely suggest these for fast paced or precision games if you ever over aim. Great product overall. Excited for the next gen ones!
B002PZ8YCO|5.0|Miss Potter was a lady of means but did something with her life. This was a real tear jerker no matter how many times you watch.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Does what it says it does.  Only problem is that it doesn't do much of anything like a Roku or WD TV Live because of Google and their restrictions.  It would be really nice to use say Plex Media Server with it or even Amazon VOD but we can't because Google is being psycho with the apps it allows.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Here is a book that has it all: SciFi, Mystery, Thriller, Romanse, Suspense, Historical Fiction. All mixed in with a great story.The range of human emotions is on display by someone the most captivating protagonist will keep the pages turning into the night . No one can have a dry eye at the end of this one and what an ending. Great entertainment for all!!
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I LOVE it it is cool.<br />So I promise it super cool do yall like it to. How the crab
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This series was very interesting. The last book really ties things together. Personally, I wasn't a fan of the main characters but pressed on with the books anyway since I had already invested so much in them. The ending of the series was very good, though. Veronica Roth wrote the right ending for this series. I was afraid, at first, that she would choose the easier and softer way out. But the ending was realistic for the novels and that was what truly redeemed the books in my eyes. But as for dystopian novels, The Hunger Games series shall always have a most special and reserved place in my heart.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really like it my kids play it all the time. So do i love it alot I really really like it alot. It is really cool
0345529057|5.0|I haven't finished the first book, but I've seen the first season, which is what  made me purchase the set. I really love the setting to this books. But I wished Kal Drogo had not been killed off.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|I am stuck on another person's profile!! I am afraid that I may have to delete the app! I like this game a lot and I am at a very far level. I hope it doesn't come to that!! :(
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Well done for a continued story line. I was crying, laughing out loud and so much more worth the read
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Very fun game. Also my daughter has a lot of laughter. My kids are just so stuck on the game
B008602KQI|5.0|The movie is exciting and has excellent special effects. Jennifer Lawrence gives a terrific performance. Then again, I am partial to science fiction.
B00ELCZSS2|5.0|Ellie Goulding is awesome; she has an amazing voice. Her music is always great for road trips, shopping trips, working out, doing homework, everything!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is amazing! every time there is an update, this game becomes more PC equivalent on every update! (Last time there was an update, Mojang added the PC title screen and are currently working on multiplayer.) I also love the graphics in this game. So thank you Notch (the intelligent man who was in charge of creating the game.) for creating one of the most popular of games that will remain as a memorable icon in the comuinity.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is awesome my whole family love it with all of our hearts it is very fun and challenging you can unlock new levels I had this app for a day and I love it you should get the app and its free so your not wasting your money isn't that great
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Stiff acting and predictable outcomes. The premise was good, but was executed amateurishly. You never really care about the characters and find that the talent they hired for this movie was not exploited.<br /><br />It's not all bad, of course; it has its moments. The CG was not the the standards of a higher budget film, but passable.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is so much fun and frustrating at the same time. When I have free time, it's my go to game. A...Maz...Ing!
B00CHVIAS4|5.0|My family and I absolutely LOVED this movie.  I'm not sure who loves it more, my husband or my daughter?  It is just a fun movie for the whole family to enjoy, and I recommend it for ANYONE!!
B001RHOJSE|3.0|It is a very importan essay on moral and evil, showing that it can be found in low-minded persons. I think that some remarks (those aimed at the jew´s leaders responsibility in the magnitude of the Holocaust) though they might partially true, were set in an inappropieate momento.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|It just wasn't what I expected, and I absolutely HATED the ending!!  The characters just weren't true to the first book in the series, and I wasn't satisfied with how the story progressed, and especially how it ended.
B005K0HDGE|1.0|Back to the Future did it a lot better, and without the liberal agenda of the author.  I quit after about 30 minutes.  I had stopped reading Stephen King about 30 years ago because he started writing garbage.  I'll probably wait another 30 before I try again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So very happy to be able to play this on my kindle!!!!! I love this game it is so incredibly addictive!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Best Christmas music. Love The Piano Guys. This CD will be played over and over throughout the season and will probably linger on throughout the year. You can never gey sick of The Piano Guys.
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|I enjoyed the story, but I just couldn't get invested into the characters the actors portrayed.  Worth watching once if you are a big ghost/horror fan.
B008PE9GSA|5.0|A lot has been said about this album as a return to the old ZZ Top and I would have to agree.  I think that's a great thing but to be honest I haven't minded the newer stuff all that much.  My biggest complaint with the last few albums is the over-produced sound.  That is still on this record to a certain extent but it's definitely got a crisper sound.  I guess this one is a return to the Eliminator days; you could take anyone of these songs and drop them on to Eliminator or Afterburner without sounding out of place.  I really like this album, it feels fresh and familiar at the same time.  The musicianship is great and Frank Beard's drums really thump.  It's going to be getting a lot of play in the truck in the coming months.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|this is a fun sci-fi show. wish it could have lasted a few more years. the show has a huge following.
1576751988|5.0|This is an excellent book by a great author who knows how to inform and motivate. It contains a lot of practical information that can make a huge task more tolerable by following a few simple steps. I would recommend this book to anyone who struggles with procrastination. Review written and submitted by Eddie Coronado, author of the Amazon.com book titled &#34;Manifest Your Millions: A Lottery Winner Shares his Law of Attraction Secrets&#34;
B000LTAY1U|2.0|I really like this watch. I've had it for over 3 months and it still looks great. aesthetically it was exactly what I was looking for, it looks great and it feels like its well made. However, this watch can't keep time at all. I find that I have to constantly keep resetting it to get a somewhat accurate reading. It gains about 20 minutes every 3 days (that's about as often as I glance at it now) and resetting it has become such a nuisance that now only do it on Saturdays, and hence is the only day I use it to keep time. the rest of the week i just look at my phone.<br /><br />tl;dr<br />Looks nice but is seldom accurate
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|So glad I bought this! I LOVE it! Great range of music, from fun to soothing. Silent night is simply beautiful. Best cd purchase I've made all year.
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|Awesome game, insanely hard but awesome. Listen to the guy that's nearby at the beginning as he has awesome tips.
B00FAVRHBE|5.0|Before I start here, I want to be perfectly clear about something: For years of being a geek, I have cared not one single iota for anything in the DOCTOR WHO universe. I didn't care about the shows, I didn't care about The Daleks, The Cybermen, the Sonic Screwdriver, The TARDIS; none of it. In fact, I had made it a point, despite my other geek friends practically forcing me to watch, to almost actively be against DOCTOR WHO.<br /><br />In other words, I didn't want to like this. What's even worse is that I didn't want to LOVE it.<br /><br />And now I do.<br /><br />THE DAY OF THE DOCTOR will make you a fan of The Doctor, and this is part of the genius of Steven Moffat, as well as David Tennant, Matt Smith, Billie Piper, and John Hurt.<br /><br />It could have been so easy to screw this up, to have three Doctors in the same place at the same time, but Moffat has yet to do me wrong. Initially with his fantastic reimagining of the Jekyll/Hyde story with JEKYLL, then with his beyond awe-inspiring reimagining of the adventures of Holmes and Watson with SHERLOCK, and now... he's made me a DOCTOR WHO fan. Of course it doesn't hurt to have so many fantastic performers in one place either. I've been a fan of David Tennant without being a WHO fan, and who doesn't love John Hurt? This is literally my first exposure to Matt Smith, and I have to state that I am looking forward to getting to the 11th Doctor, because I've been binge-watching WHO starting with the 9th Doctor, Christopher Eccleston, and the introduction of Piper as Rose Tyler, and I've just recently finished Tennant's first season with \\"Doomsday\\" and that hit me right in the feels. I want to be finished by this year's Christmas episode.<br /><br />I know that this review makes me seem like I'm jumping on a bandwagon, and perhaps I am, despite my best intentions, but THE DAY OF THE DOCTOR is so marvelously entertaining, so charming, so smart and surprisingly dark at times, and having a better perspective on it now that I've seen some of the past episodes, it's just kind of miraculous. It's a shame that they couldn't get Eccleston, but his loss.<br /><br />So thank you again, Steven Moffat. You've made someone who never EVER wanted to be a fan of DOCTOR WHO now asking for Sonic Screwdrivers and a TARDIS for Christmas.<br /><br />I'm not quite down with the fezes or bow ties yet, though. But who knows? Or who nose?at I've seen some of the past episodes, it's just kind of miraculous.

B007AJFSJW|2.0|Firstly, I would like to acknowledge the honourable and sincere desire of the author.. Which good soul would not like to alleviate the sufferings of the fellow-citizens?<br /><br />However; creation, achievement, over-coming the difficulties, goals and objectives are never achieved by externalities or committees; especially governments despite the occasional intent beyond self-interest. Evolution and history is the proof that, it has always been a personal endeavour based on aspiration, conviction and can-do.<br /><br />America is wonderfully endowed with the very best of human spirit and creative human architecture. I have lived in America and has experienced the fragrance of freedom and the energy of creation, first hand. I have been fortunate to have lived in several countries, none of them come close...despite the gloom and doom machinery in America, which seems to be working full 3 shifts a day...!<br /><br />I am convinced that, no country has a better mix of founding values and creative architectural composition eminently suited for human-improvement. greater good and rejuvenation under duress.<br /><br />However, this superb mix can be meddled with; with a potential danger of poorer future to America and beyond (yes, beyond...) via externality and committee driven greater-good doctrines, such as interventionist government; however good-hearted, into the fundamentals of human character, traits and creative tensions.<br /><br />With utmost respect, I disagree with the fundamentals of the author and would say that, his views not only defies economics; but history, physics as well as psychology.<br /><br />Great step forward is to acknowledge, learn, amend and move-forward.<br /><br />To dream of achieving newer and lasting heights of prosperity out of fiat is no less ludicrous than an Indian Swami professing to produce things out of thin air....for goodness sake, surely...we have progressed since those make believe days, haven't we?<br /><br />In this wonderful, energy-filled and dynamic congregation called market, there is always going to be asymmetry between demand and supply...imagine the dull life without it...it would look like a grey army marching without velour or virtue.<br /><br />Not to artificially rewire, revision and intervene in the natural rebalancing is the right way forward., energy-filled and dynamic congregation called market, there is always going to be asymmetry between demand and supply...imagine the dull life without it...it would look like a grey army marching without velour or virtue.<br /><br />Not to artificially rewire, revision and intervene in the natural rebalancing is the right way forward.
B00E5N8DGG|3.0|Great to see them in concert again, but their vocal range isn't what it used to be.  I was hoping for a bit more, the range affected a couple songs.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Awesome book,full of surprises.I couldn't put this book down. Catching Fire caught my attention and not many books do that
0802798233|5.0|This is just one book for the series of three. I have read all three and loved them all. Quick to read and keeps your attention.
B007SOQBCM|5.0|Just like the title says: The app is great, and doesn't need anymore options other than adding a chat option. I use this app daily, and only rarely does it crash or have problems.
B000FC1LOC|5.0|Highly recommend this book! I could not put this book down!  Very interesting plot!  Very interesting moral dilemma in the book.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Great graphics great game. Smooth controls, you can also customize your hud. Weapons can be customise and there's four classes to choose from. They went in on this one.  More improvements added to this game series. You'll like it its worth the buy. It's really all I play.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|In The Husband's Secret, I really loved the way the plot is built on and revealed step by step, giving the reader a sliver at a time through different perspectives.  I found the story suspenseful and entertaining with an unexpected ending.  When I was finished reading the book, I couldn't stop thinking about how things might have or should have ended differently.  I can't think of any negatives about this book, I thoroughly enjoyed it!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|Very good for slr one of the best bags for travling can fit computers good for professional photographers andq very spacial.
B007SGM084|5.0|The best read ever.  Once you start reading this trilogy you will my be able to put it down.  By far the best series I have ever read!!

B006NXIO0Q|5.0|THIS movie was a good action movie.  It won't put you to sleep at night and recommend it if you haven't seen it yet.
B008RF0M9O|4.0|Fit just fine, hopefully last longer than the Sony originals which flake off on every headset I've owned. Cheap as dirt, but will take about 3 weeks to arrive from China, which is no big deal, see also: cheap as dirt.
B0063GORYU|5.0|I play this game whenever I'm bored and waiting at the doctors office or when the program on tv is boring. Good challenging game...
B00EI4V3X2|4.0|For those looking for a headphone for their PS4, PS3 or XBOX 360, the &#34;Turtle Beach Ear Force PX4&#34; is a headphone that works but is it for you?<br /><br />I.  WHAT'S INSIDE THE BOX<br /><br />You get the:<br /><br />- Turtle Beach PX4 headphones with premium 50 mm neodymium speaker drivers, play & charge rechargeable battery with USB connector for recharge and is 100% wireless Bluetooth.  So you can chat and also answer calls while playing.  With Adjustable surround sound angles.<br />- PX4 Wireless Digital RF Transmitter<br />- 2.5 to 3.5m Mobile Adapter Cable<br />- Digital Optical Cable<br />- Headset USB charging cable<br />- XBOX 360 Chat Cable<br />- Quick Start Guide<br />- Turtle Beach Sticker<br /><br />*  IMPORTANT THINGS TO KNOW:<br />-- The USB adapter for the headphones ONLY recharges the headphones which gives you 15 hours of wireless play.  These headphones DO NOT plug in to a PS4, PS3, XBOX360 or PC/MAC for direct audio via USB.<br />-- You will want to buy this headset primarily for PS4, PS3 or XBOX 360 play.  You can use a Mac or PC if you have a special soundcard which uses an optical cable.<br /><br />II.  INITIAL THOUGHTS ON USING THE HEADSET<br /><br />The setup was easy on the PS3 and XBOX 360 (may not work with first gen consoles) as you plug in the transmitter to your unit, hold down the pairing button on the side for five seconds.<br /><br />Power up your headset for six seconds and you will hear the headset turn on and then hear a few musical beeps and your headset is paired.<br /><br />For a PS4, it's important to know that the headset is not 100% wireless as you will need to plug the 2.5 to 3.5 mm mobile adapter cable to your controller.  Until Sony creates a patch, this is the only way to go for now, so it's not 100% wireless.<br /><br />For those experiencing drop off with audio, which I did experience.  The following information from Turtle Beach did fix the issue:<br /><br />1.  Go to Settings &#62; Screen and Sound &#62; Audio Output Settings &#62; Primary Output Port.<br />2.  Select “Digital Out” (OPTICAL).<br />3.  Select ONLY “Dolby Digital 5.1ch”.<br />4.  Go to Settings &#62; Sound and Screen &#62; Audio Output Settings &#62; Output to Headphones.<br />5.  Select “Chat Audio”.<br />6.  Go to Settings &#62; Sound and Screen &#62; Audio Output Settings &#62; Audio Format (Priority).<br />7.  Select “Bitstream (Dolby)”.<br />If your chat volume is either too loud or too soft:<br />•  Go to Settings &#62; Devices &#62; Audio Devices &#62; Headsets and Headphones &#62; Volume Control (Headphones) and change the audio level.<br /><br />The headset was comfortable and light.  The build is good but at $150, you expect something a bit more durable.<br /><br />I like the fact that the cable to recharge is long.  So, for those sitting several feet away, will like the fact that when they are recharging this headset, they can be farther away from their console and not too close from it.<br /><br />The mic is easy to bend and doesn't seem too flimsy.<br /><br />The sound on the unit was very good, not great.  I did experience drop off audio at times, I also had issues with hiss due to the transmitter but this is only when recharging.  Otherwise, without the recharging cable, things worked perfectly fine as it does feature interference-free, Dual-Band Wi-Fi Wireless Technology.<br /><br />But when it came down to sound, what was important for me was full immersion, the use of Dolby Digital Surround Sound and directional activity was what made me smile during the use of these headphones.  Sounds were crystal clear, eery sounds really came alive and sounds I have never heard before from certain games were quite interesting to hear.  And the fact that you can adjust the surround sound angles is very cool!  But you'll notice a big difference by turning Surround Sound on and off on the transmitter, it makes a big difference having it on!<br /><br />Of course, if you want more customization, you will need to go for a more expensive Turtle Beach headset.<br /><br />Pairing for two Bluetooth devices is pretty cool, so you can play and take calls on the headset while still playing your game.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />While there are other Turtle Beach Headsets and other brand of headsets that work and sound great with the PS3 and XBOX 360, the majority of the people interested in the PX4 is that it does work with the PS4.<br /><br />It's important to note that at this time, everyone who owns a PX4 is awaiting a patch and hopefully Turtle Beach and Sony will be able to make this headset 100% wireless.  But for now, for the mic, you're going to have a cable that plugs in to your controller.<br /><br />There are other Turtle Beach headsets (granted they are a little more expensive) that sound better than the PX4's, but if anything that surprises me the most is the price.  At $150, it may be a bit too much for some people, especially for those expecting quality in par as the customization as the PX5's which are $30 more.<br /><br />So for PS3 and XBOX 360 owners, you already have alternatives of headsets out there to purchase and use, especially from Turtle Beach that are less or more expensive than the PX4.<br /><br />But for PS4 owners, choices are limited at the moment and the PX4 does get the job done, not perfectly but it does work.  And with a patch update, will make this headset 100% wireless.<br /><br />If you are looking for a headset that works for the PS4 and are a supporter of Turtle Beach headsets, The Turtle Beach Ear Force PX4 is the way to go!mization, you will need to go for a more expensive Turtle Beach headset.<br /><br />Pairing for two Bluetooth devices is pretty cool, so you can play and take calls on the headset while still playing your game.<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />While there are other Turtle Beach Headsets and other brand of headsets that work and sound great with the PS3 and XBOX 360, the majority of the people interested in the PX4 is that it does work with the PS4.<br /><br />It's important to note that at this time, everyone who owns a PX4 is awaiting a patch and hopefully Turtle Beach and Sony will be able to make this headset 100% wireless.

B006O5XYWG|4.0|I bought this because the price was good and the fact that I like to watch movies. I recommend it if you like sic-fi
B009FZHYKU|4.0|Walking dead, who doesn't like the Walking Dead?<br />My husband and me bought it because we missed that season while we were out of the country.  It was good to watch them all continuesly before the next season was played in TV.
B0049J3QAY|4.0|The movie was just a movie my wife and I decided to watch together on a chill night and it was really funny for both of us since we hadn't seen it in many years.
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|I liked the movie, I had the chance of watching it at home.<br />what can I say? It is a Disney production, moving you to a wonderland.<br /><br />I recomend it.
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|I don't understand the point of linkedin.  I get people asking me to give them references.. s***, I don't even know these people.  I don't get it.  Sorry.
B00D7Z4GQY|3.0|This was a fairly good book. Not very moving, but a well written one. Was not one that you just couldn't put down.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|This book gets better and better as the story unfolds. I can't wait to read the next book in the series.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|12/11/13-Further Update: Chromecast has one big advantage over Apple TV. You can cast content to your TV as the SAME TIME you are using your iPhone vs. the Apple TV. If you use your phone to stream content to an Apple TV you are only allowed to stream content you are watching and you cannot do anything else with your phone while streaming. So the Chromecast advantage is it allows me to check text, e-mails, surf the web or use apps while casting at the same time. You can literally cast Netflix to your TV while watching another video like ESPN on your iPhone at the same time if you wanted to do this.<br /><br />12/4/13-Finally found phone number for Google Chromecast Support. After speaking to rep for 40 minutes still couldn't set up Chromecast using iPhone vs PC liked I tried 1st day (see below) until rep gave up and was just going to e-mail me list of things I should try after our call. I looked at my firewall settings on gateway(modem/router). Security was set at Max/High and this prevented set up. I set to Medium and Chromecast set up completed in about a minute. The rep never suggested looking at firewall settings and put me on hold several times trying to find answer to set up issues. I was now finally able to cast from PC or iPhone. The cast button now shows up within HBOGO, Pandora, Netflix & YouTube Apps on iPhone. I was able to put firewall back on High Security after set up and Chromecast worked properly.<br /><br />But the next day my iPhone refused to acknowledge Chromecast was set up even though TV showed Ready to Cast. Casting from PC worked but not the iPhone. I started to set up like a new device using the iPhone and suddenly the Chromecast showed up as Ready to cast. So it does not work as seamless like the Apple TV.<br /><br />I also had issue trying to pause after phone went to sleep while casting. Since you are not streaming but actually casting you cannot use pause button within apps but must wait for Chromecast to be recognized and use that pause button. When I was able to pause however it started up again and It would not allow me to just display on iPhone or eject until after numerous attempts.<br /><br />12/2/13-Original Review Posted: I used my PC during 1st installation set up attempt vs iPhone. Suggest you use your iPhone for initial set up if this will be your primary casting device vs. a PC. The Chromecast works just fine after setting up using the iPhone.<br /><br />For starters I have iOS version 7.0.4 installed on an iPhone5 which is Apple's most current version. All Apps are most recent versions.<br /><br />I downloaded the Google Cast extension for Chrome on iOS/iPhone. The support.google.com/chromecast/troubleshooterpage indicated the Cast button should be shown within the HBOGO, Pandora & YouTube apps but it is not. I went so far as to delete the apps and re-install trying to fix the casting issue but this made no difference.<br /><br />I am able to cast from within the Netflix app for iPhone only. However, it takes numerous attempts get casting to work as well.<br /><br />I was able to cast once after installation from the PC but now keep getting the message \\"Connected to network but can't access the internet\\" or \\"Brain Freeze, were sorry but something could not load\\".<br /><br />And the most annoying thing is the Chromecast keeps knocking off my PC from the wifi network like during the installation process. I have to manually reconnect to my network. This NEVER happened before Chromecast (12/3 I fixed this issue by unchecking connect automatically on start up button which was making Chromecast my desired home network. I hit this button when I had issues trying to set up and thought this might be the reason for set up problems which was really firewall settings)<br /><br />I also have Apple TV. Compared to Chromecast the Apple TV is much better and works seamlessly with about 10 times the more available content but will run you 3X the cost of Chromecast. Depends on your needs.
B005PK56TA|4.0|Great definition. Spooky series that features horror, dark humor, romance, intrigue,great talent (Jessica Lange gives a legendary performance). I admit I got hooked and watched about 7 episodes in one sitting! Recommend it to anyone, especially those who like a real good ghost story.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Bought one of these over Thanksgiving and it is awesome. Sends a great picture and is super easy to setup. My dad was so impressed he's thinking about getting one for my mom to use with her slingbox.

B004XZR63M|5.0|A must read for anyone wanting to leave the rat race.<br />This book should be required reading for school kids.
B00G32VYDG|2.0|Very predictable, and seemed like they were trying to copy the characters from MIB.  It just didn't work.  Graphics were okay though.
B00F14IL06|5.0|I didn’t know if I was going to add Clawdia to my collection.  The promotional photos I had seen made her toothy smile look strange, her hair seemed garish, and I didn’t like how she looked wearing her glasses.  She just didn’t seem like a Monster High character, even though she is part of the pack – the older sister of Clawdeen, Clawd and Howleen. But,  I changed my mind about Clawdia when I saw her in person, she is a very charming doll.<br /><br />Clawdia Wolf is the Daughter of the Werewolf, so she shares the canine characteristic of her siblings – visible pointed ears, clawed fingers and fangs.  Clawdia has long, wavy Easter egg yellow hair and glowing yellow eyes.  Clawdia has red, yellow and metallic silver eye makeup and dark burgundy lips.  She is wearing a black and metallic gold mini dress of a tribal pattern that includes half-moons.  Over her dress she has a red and black suit jacket, and she is wears red knee socks that match her jacket.  Clawdia’s accessories include black earrings, eyeglasses, a black bracelet, chunky gold moon necklace and gold hobnail mary jane heels.  She has a tablet, journal and writing pen to assist her in her pursuit of a career in Hauntlywood.  This doll comes with a hairbrush, doll stand and diary.<br /><br />Clawdia Wolf is a new Monster High character, and is part of the new Frights, Camera, Action! line of dolls.  As an “older” Monster High character, Clawdia is larger in size than the average MH doll – she is the same size as Nefra De Nile.  Like other monster high dolls she is made for play and collecting, but should be treated gently.
1616550414|5.0|I received the Hyrule Historia as a gift for my birthday. I LOVE this book!! I have always been a huge Zelda fan, and I'm happy they finally relieved the timeline (Even if it does seem a little, thrown together.) There is lots of art work, and artist concepts, there is even a Manga in the back, with a short story of the first link, before Skyward sword. Really awesome book for any Zelda fan.
B00GX598FO|5.0|very fun movie to watch and like all the actors in there roles casting was perfect and the movie kept you involved with everything that was happening.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Playing &#34;A Family Christmas&#34; completes the Christmas feeling!  Beautiful music to play in the background of going about the Christmas season.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great set of movies for an incredible price. I've been wanting this for a while but wasn't willing to pay full price but the sale price was too good to pass up.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I purchased ChromeCast for use with Aereo as a small experiment. I just recently got a new apartment and was trying to save money by using Aereo as my go to Television source and using Chromecast to Cast my video. The idea is a fairly common one but it is not officially supported by Google as of yet. So while you are in fact able to do this by watching TV from Chrome using Aereo and then casting a tab it does not work perfectly. However, when using Chromecast supported apps the Chromecast works wonderfully. Netflix and Youtube are easy to use and controlling either from a pc, tablet, or smartphone is easy peasy. For $35 I think this is an absolute steal!
B002H3EUAE|5.0|One of the best movies ever. I've seen this a movie about a million times but as soon as I saw this set I had to buy it.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|This game is a lot of fun.  I like the graphics and sound effects. It may be free but the game is designed for you to spend real money if you want any chance of getting a decent score on any of the later levels.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|I have been wrapped up in the lives of Jamie and Claire for 19 years. Reading these never get old!
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I'm no connoisseur of tower defense games, but I certainly have enjoyed a few in the past.  I find Bloons TD 5 to be top notch in this category.  The amount of variety here is astounding.  Many, many levels for every skill set, many different towers and each with a large variety of power-ups.  This is fun addicting game-play.
034580404X|5.0|Love it... I read it over and over. Really want hardcover but not found any.  Best books I have read and continue to read..
B003B02PEU|4.0|great read thoroughly enjoyed it. not as fast paced as others but still interesting at all times. ending gives closure.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I have spent many hours playing the Candy Crush Saga. Just when you think you will never get to the next stage, all of a sudden you get 5-6 stages in a row. Keeps you coming back f o r more.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|Up to this point it seems to work fine.  I gave the highest rating more for the fact that Amazon supplied the charger at no cost/no prob.  It must be a common occurrence to need these for my style of KINDLE.  I will know in several months if this product truly rate this rating.
B000002B5L|5.0|Their best and springboard for all the rest. Back before fame, families, folly and infamy struck them in different ways killing the Fugees spirit. But their essence will live on forever with this classic.
B008MWBY6W|3.0|This case was free, so I shouldn't complain but if someone was to ask me if I would personally purchase it I would say no. It fits my Nikon D3100, but only that. There is not much space it the side pockets and it doesn't fit any other lenses in the case. Free, but wouldn't pay for it!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|OMG I love love love love love this album & I haven't listened to it all the way through yet! I love all the fresh takes on classic songs & the emotion behind all the traditionally played ones! The mixture of the piano & cello is so breathtaking!!!! I LOVE THE PIANO GUYS!!!!!!
B005CKPQNE|5.0|What can be said simply the best show ever on TV.  I rented this movie on Amazon because I had to see it again.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|I've played all of the Fire Maple games to date. This like the others, has been a whole lot of fun. Graphics are nice, story is fun and keeps you looking for your next step. I like that there is a way to get help if you get stuck. Personally, I think all of these games are too short. That's only because I have so much fun with them. I look forward to the next Fire Maple game. Keep them coming!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very good game for your mind and easy to play. You have to make sure one can play this game well. Some of the steps in the game are very challenging and one is on the same game for a while until you figure out the puzzle.
145210655X|5.0|This is a fantastic book.  Even if you don't have kids and are just a Star Wars fan, I'd recommend this.  Very entertaining.
B005J6LKVI|5.0|I just love this movie.I was satisfied with the picture quality. The price was reasonable too. I would recommend this.
1401324649|5.0|Extremely well written and entertaining.  The right & wrong people all receive their just desserts.  The geography lesson alone, is worth the read.
B00EEPFRGE|5.0|This album makes me feel like I've stepped back into 1985 (or thereabouts)! All that's missing is the spandex and hairspray! Stryper meant so much to me as a newborn-Christian in high school. As a metalhead and a Christian I always found it somewhat sad that there was a vacuum for positive messages in the music that I loved. In 1983 I read an article about &#34;The Yellow and Black Attack&#34; in Time magazine (I think it was Time) and ran out to my local record store to find out what all the fuss was about.<br /><br />I was pleasantly surprised to find a band with a positive message whose musicianship not only met the level of their peers in the rock music scene, but surpassed it. I've seen Stryper several times through the years and, as one whose seen virtually all the major metal acts from the 70's and 80's, can honestly attest that Stryper's talent level is off-the-chart! With most bands, you love the studio work but when you see them live or hear them on a live record, you walk away feeling somewhat disappointed with the drop off in quality. With Stryper, you get what you hear on record and then some! Their vocal and guitar harmonies are absolutely spot-on live! Michael Sweet's vocals don't drop off one bit. He hits notes that, as a wannabe vocalist myself, make me sad. It's simply incredible  for someone that's got to be over 50 years old to be able to sing like he does! I'm not talking about vocals with help from an artificial recording, either. I've been within 5 feet of him in the front row of a venue and can bear witness that it's the real deal! God has truly blessed all four of these guys with a considerable degree of talent.<br /><br />If you are a metal musician/metal fan but not a Christian, I still highly recommend checking out Stryper. You won't find a tighter twin-guitar attack in the music business (including the likes of Thin Lizzy and the Allman Brothers). The dual and harmonized solos that Michael Sweet and Oz Fox construct are second to none.<br /><br />As mentioned by a few other reviewers, it's nice to see that Michael Sweet and Oz Fox have returned to the roots of their guitar playing on this album. Every solo kicks butt! Get the album. It's as metal an album as they've ever done. May God continue to bless Srtyper.r /><br />As mentioned by a few other reviewers, it's nice to see that Michael Sweet and Oz Fox have returned to the roots of their guitar playing on this album.

B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Great mid-finale, hope that soon comes February to see the next chapters, I need to know what is going to happen to the governor
B00B0YL0E0|5.0|They've done it again! Though I've never heard a truly &#34;poor&#34; album from Pretty Maids, I was fully expecting this album to be at least a shade weaker than their last disc, &#34;Pandemonium.&#34; I even read an online interview with Ronnie Atkins (singer) in which, during the making of &#34;Motherland, he expressed a fear that it would be tough to top &#34;Pandemonium.&#34; Having listened to my newly purchased copy of &#34;Motherland&#34; about 10 times now, I'm glad to report that not only is &#34;Motherland&#34; on par with their previous album, it may very well be superior.<br /><br />Ronnie Atkins voice is still as unique and powerful as ever, the mix is still phenomenal, and the songwriting is stronger than ever (in terms of content AND variety). If you are an old fan of Pretty Maids but have not yet purchased this album, don't worry; it is truly great! You won't be disappointed. If you are reading this with a sense of curiosity because you've heard of this group but have never checked them out, then you are denying yourself a great pleasure every moment you delay in purchasing a Pretty Maids album. Honestly, I do not have enough superlatives to describe how tremendous a band these guys are and, likewise, how shameful it is that they are not stars of the highest magnitude in the world of rock.<br /><br />I find it sad to think of the many mediocre bands that have &#34;made it&#34; to achieve star status (no names mentioned to protect the guilty) while this band remains mired in obscurity. Though I hale from the &#34;good ole' days&#34; of metal (the 80's) and thus quite naturally find this type of music appealing, my teenage daughter, a product of the sickening pop-music scene in which we currently belong, freely admits that these guys should be mega-stars! While one song might be hard-core enough to peel the paint off your walls, the next might easily fit into a top 40 radio mix. You'll shake your head with incredulity that the same band can produce such diversity. You'll want to slap Justin Bieber for the simple fact that he's a multi-milliionaire while such truly talented artists as Pretty Maids are as much a mystery to the world as the truth behind the Kennedy-assassination.<br /><br />Purchase &#34;Motherland&#34; for yourself and, like me, you'll shake your fists at the powers-that-be wondering, &#34;where's the justice in this world!?&#34; Why these guys are not known by every rock music fan on the planet is beyond comprehension. Heck, my 67  year old mother even digs Pretty Maids! Talk about a wide audience....17 to 67! Perhaps even more sad is that Pretty Maids don't even get &#34;pub&#34; from sources that you'd think would sing their praises. &#34;That Metal Show&#34; comes to mind. Though, as a metal fan, I consider myself a fan of that popular VH1 Classic show, I've never heard them even mention Pretty Maids. COME ON EDDIE TRUNK! Where's the love? These guys are great! This album should get &#34;metal album of the year&#34; but.....it won't. Oh the injustice!ch diversity.

B00G3Q6VPS|3.0|We live in a time blanketed by post-modernism. A time when knowing self-possession is what pop singers want to convey through their image. A time when the simple dream of becoming rich and famous gets shut down because naivety is weakness. Turn to late 2013 and the career of part-time singer, part-time reality show judge, part-time mogul, and full-time (?) mother Britney Spears, and every logical thing gets thrown out the window. At this point, her persistent grasp of pop culture (or maybe our persistent gullible nature of falling for her brand) defies everything. How the hell does she continue to mesmerize us without even seeming fully engaged? Does she even need to expand her empire through the release of sub-par music? Does she even know what day it is? Britney Spears, in whatever incarnation, is probably a lot smarter than we give her credit for or has the best folks working for her brand.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, I LOVE me some Brit Brit, but claims of Britney, the SINGER, not being present since her &#34;Blackout&#34; days are not entirely unwarranted. Britney has always been quite the vampy chameleon, often compensating for her lack of chops with personality. Ever since her (in)famous breakdown, she has been reduced to willing cipher, bending and performing to her producers' instincts. It's a sad degeneration, but if you've got the best team behind you, your music will continue to thrill even the most discriminating pop aficionados.<br /><br />Oh yes, and for a Britney album, &#34;Britney Jean&#34; is okay. Like any other dance-pop album, it's a mixed bag that's meant to highlight the singles. Trouble is the singles aren't that great. &#34;Work Bitch&#34;'s novelty degrades it to being noisy and annoying, while &#34;Perfume&#34; is cute and nothing more. &#34;Alien&#34;'s gorgeous backing track juxtaposed with Britney's (digitally-enhanced) longing vocals is refreshing. &#34;Passenger&#34; rejuvenates the notion that Britney can exist in other sonic hemispheres other than EDM-influenced pop. Other than that, everything else is forgettable and anonymous. People still love Britney though because deep down they don't want to admit that they want her to be this symbol of hope overcoming adversity. We still want her to step up her game and be fiercer than ever, even though in reality she's going to continue to flatline while being paraded in the flashiest new trends. We still want her to make that truly &#34;personal&#34; album a la &#34;Ray of Light,&#34; even though in reality no one's ever going to be Madonna. We still want her to be human again, even though in reality she's too drugged up to even feel anymore. Bless her heart, Britney Spears, please continue to be the darling of American media even though you've become nothing but a hollow shell for commerce.
B00BL9860K|5.0|I should know by now, that if I start a David Baldacci novel, I'll have to keep reading until I know how it ends....which I did! Great story line, which I won't spoil for you, except to say, make sure you have a comfy spot and prepare for a really good story!
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|These days, the thing about Lady Gaga is that no one knows where to start (not even she herself). She can't seem to give a concise, direct description of her often thrilling, often messy third studio album, &#34;ARTPOP.&#34; These are dangerous times for her because the more grandiose or &#34;free&#34; she is as an artiste, the deeper she digs her grave. Her situation is tricky not because she might become too overwhelming, but because sadly, there's nothing to be overwhelmed by anymore. Basically, her shtick is getting old. You can dress up a corpse, but in the end, it's still dead. Such are the pitfalls of overexposure.<br /><br />Whereas &#34;Born This Way&#34; had a red-blooded heart beneath all the camp, leather, and hair metal fetishism, &#34;ARTPOP&#34; is cold, detached, and too obvious in its commerce. Lady Gaga happened when &#34;artistry&#34; and commerce procreated the bastard child no one ever wanted but in the end needed in order to save post-millennial pop. Usually Gaga's status as an occasional critical darling is heralded because everyone loves a crazy bitch (thank you, Britney). This time around, it seems her Little Monsters are starting to smell the stink of capitalist gimmickry.<br /><br />It's not that &#34;ARTPOP&#34; is a terrible vehicle for something dystopian. Far from it. To even put the album in meta terms is to patronize the living hell out of it because quite simply, it's nothing more than shiny, glitchy, modern-sounding dance-pop that fronts meaningless lyrics. Sure, there are times when Gaga does display talent superior to her peers (there isn't much competition these days). Sure, she might just try to sneak in nuggets of genuine gratitude through her music. All in all though, &#34;ARTPOP&#34; is a brittle, yet brand-spanking new product that probably won't age too well. Purely taken on a musical level, there are some interesting sounds here and there, but nothing that will break new ground. That's quite a shame because for every LadyGaga release, everyone always looks forward to another &#34;Bad Romance&#34; or &#34;Poker Face,&#34; earworms that crystalize the sound of a generation. Lady Gaga may not have reinvented the wheel this time around, but I'm afraid to say she feels there is no other option but to try to. Maybe next time (if there is one).
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|Gaga slays it again! The foil is beautiful and I love every track! (Well, we can forget about Jewels 'n' Drugs). Not her best album ever, but certainly a favorite. Paws up!
B002XTBE8I|4.0|Refill defiantly makes up for Relapse. This album should be a part of your of your Eminem collection.  Shipped very quickly!
B00G6ZTM3Y|5.0|very fun just like minecaft. but there was on problem<br />the game was 5$ it should be more like 3.99 but other<br />then that is perfect
B000VWSINI|5.0|I couldn't find my original copy so i bought it again; that means a lot coming from me. This is a great Eminem CD; it takes me back to when i was in Jr. High without a care in the world.
0060922583|5.0|Mind expanding.  Michael Talbot explains a very complex subject in a way that most people can comprehend.  I refer to this book often in my energy medicine work.
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|He did it again; another great album from Eminem. I believe that Eminem has secured a spot in the top 3 greatest wordsmiths of all time. Getting the deluxe was defiantly worth the little bit of extra money; you get five more tracks that are for the most part dope.
B004UXUX4Q|3.0|The product is nice and I am happy, but because this is about the entire transaction I must give it only 3 stars and will note that this was ordered for guaranteed delivery on a Wednesday...and it didn't arrive until the following Monday.  Too late for the birthday party I bought it for.  Not Amazon's fault...according to tracking it was loaded on a truck 10 miles from my house Wednesday morning but somehow UPS couldn't get it to me for 5 more days.  Weather was NOT A FACTOR.  Very disappointing.  The product gets 5 stars, UPS gets 0 stars.  Order it plenty in advance if you are relying on UPS!
B002ZG97EC|3.0|My rating is based not on the movie itself but is instead on the Digital Copy format. First, when ordering, it is not immediately obvious that the digital copy redemption code &#34;may not work after 12/31/2011&#34; this information is hidden at the bottom of the description that must be expanded. Fortunately, it worked today (12/02/2013). I am disappointed however, in the format choices - basically either Windows Media (already lost one movie in a hard drive crash and they will not let you get another one) or iTunes.  I have started using UltraViolet for all my redemptions, as that provides the greatest flexibility-but not an option on this one. So, buyer beware if you are getting this primarily for the digital copy, as I was.
B001BANK32|5.0|This was my second time to read this book, and of course I have seen the movie.  It was just as good and a page turner the second time around.  I am now ready to dive into DR Sleep!!!
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|it was the ending. it was so so stunted and abrupt. very disappointed. i liked the story overall, but it seemed as if the author got bored about 2/3 through.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Elegant!<br />The big keys are perfect for my huge hands. The additional smart functions are made to order. It's one of those apps that is a must have.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I can't get enough of this music, even though Christmas music can sometimes get old.  All of the covers of traditional Christmas songs are beautiful (my personal favorite is Angels We Have Heard on High), and the original songs are wonderful as well.  I know I'll be listening to this album over and over again during the Christmas season, and probably even after Christmas has come and gone--it's that good.  You won't regret buying this album!
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|Lots of fun. Great graphics  and enough of a challenge to make it fun. Worth a try especially for a free app.
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|It's a really bad movie. Only reason for 2 stars is we win in the end.  We rented based on 1300 reviews and average of 4 stars.  15 min into it we wondered why it got 4.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|My kids and myself love this app it's great for car rides, killing time before bed or just relaxing on a rainy day
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just as addicting as the FB game... except now I can play anywhere- even without wifi! so even more addicting!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Pretty good game. Addicting<br />I would get this . It takes awhile to earn coins and oil. Worth it though try it out
B00CGNYDIE|5.0|Holy cow! Terribly addicting.... I don't like minecraft... but I love this... I passed all the levels and then went back to do them all with no errors... the only downside would be that sometimes when trying to click on the lowest color you accidentally hit 'hints'... I never used a hint anyway... so I think the hint button should be moved down further... Otherwise very addicting. Definitely going to look for another version of this game!
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|The only flaw is it cost money to unlock everything but otherwise  I love this game it is so fun I &lt;3 that you can die there hair.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|works well just a simple calculator app. nothing fancy but does the job good for the price free!!! works for me!!!
B001NHNG64|4.0|I love Jack reacher. The consummate good guy bad ass. If you like good escapism then read one.<br />You'll read them all.
B00CHSPB8Y|2.0|not a very good app, it did not respond well on my Kindle Fire I had to delete it from device.
B0041X90CQ|5.0|I will make this review short and sweet. First purchased this recording in 1973 after hearing it on the recommendation of a friend. I had listened to T-Rex before i.e.Bang a Gong etc.. But Marc Bolan just seemed to speak to me on this one. Over the years I wore it out, I still have it and have since had it framed (great cover photo by Ringo Starr) when I saw it again on Amazon I was thrilled!!! Good job on remastered version. Just as crisp and clear as I remembered. Bolan hit the mark on his writing on this one!! amazon delivered on time as usual and it arrived in great condition. Would recommend this to anyone who has heard even one song by this mad genius! Thanks amazon for helping me re-capture a small bit of my youth!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Great game, awesome story, and cool puzzles. I really like that they based the land off of the underwater city Rapture from Bioshock.
B00GX598FO|2.0|Very weak compared to Red 1.  It was a big disappointment.  I persevered until the end hoping that it would get better, but it didn't.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|It has all the necessary twists and turns in the plot to be a Bond thriller.  It fits the Bond franchise nicely!
B008ALA6DW|4.0|It works fine, but I always feel that most of Apple's accessories like this are overpriced. Also, I'm not super keen on having to have an adapter for wired network, but I can't fault the adapter for that. :)<br /><br />Works as advertised.
B007T967X4|5.0|This app is awesome!  It's entertaining and a great way to learn how to read music notes.  This game is for all ages.
B007MGWBU2|3.0|Just like way too corny. They went a bit far with the self-conscious silliness, as I see it. The plus side was it was a little nostalgic.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Love love love my chromecast! I have recommended it to several people and a few of them have purchased their own.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|One of my absolute Christmas movies of all time.  Of all the versions of this story available, the original (1947) is the best, starring Natalie Wood, Maureen O'Hara, and Edmund Gwynne.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I like trying to figure out the puzzles. This game makes my brain work hard. In other words, it Is a brain workout session.
1416550518|5.0|A &#34;page-turner&#34;.. Definitely evocative of &#34;Downton Abbey&#34;, as mentioned earlier, yet Ms. Morton's novel has differences.  Yes, the setting is similar, yet, the story is different. It is told from a distinct point-of-view. At points retrospective or extant in her storytelling, Ms. Morton delivers a compelling & enjoyable read.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|This CD is fantastic, as are all Piano Guys albums and music. Always worth the money to invest in their music. I think this CD will be added to my families Christmas traditional music.
B00770KR7W|2.0|I got a messed up foot joint it is impossible to stand upright . Also it didn't come with a peg so the chief is forced to forever hold his assault rifle.
B00003CX9W|5.0|This is a classic made in the early years of Disney. There are about 7 separate pieces with classical music arrangements specifically matched for each story (as there are no words). The subject matter ranges from whimsical and amusing to the macabre and includes mythology, evolution, ballet, the dinosaur era, the classic tale of the the Sorcerer's Apprentice (the only piece featuring Mickey or any recognizable Disney character) and a visually captivating compilation of short pieces set to the Nutcracker Suite. You will be surprised to see the darnkess of the last piece which is set in hell with its &#34;residents&#34; in a state of suffering and torture. The film shows the outstanding level of creativity of animation artists who were ahead of their times. This movie is very unlike the current fast paced and commercialized Disney offerings. If you have an appreciation for vintage animation and true artistry, you will find Fantasia to be quite a gem. It is a film that both children and adults can enjoy together (with exception to the last vingette).
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|Basically all this thing can do is: netflicks, youtube or HBO go.  2 out of the 3 services you have to pay for.  Saw the commerical and assumed i could stream my pictures and videos i took on my phone to the TV... very very bait and switch.<br /><br />Considering i don't have a netflicks or HBO go account, this thing can only do youtube... which my TV already does.<br /><br />Someone made an app that lets people stream their pictures and movies from their phone, but google blocked it.  So i'm sending my back today.
B00F0O8SZK|3.0|Heard one, heard them all.  I like Susan, but I'd like to hear something more upbeat and less of the ballad stuff that she keeps singing.  Puts me to sleep.
B00H1O3Q18|5.0|I really liked this episode. I feel that it was intense and left us wanting more.  You didn't know who was going to survive and who was going to die. I read some of the negative reviews and I was surprised there were so many that didn't like it.  I have never missed an episode and this was one of my favorites.  Carl's reaction to Judith was heartbreaking. I'm going to miss the ones that died in this episode.
B0053O8AQE|5.0|gosh, cant express how much I love this show. so relevant to my life right now and will be a keepsake when I quit this crazy job. I love the snark soo much i'm addicted-- because there will always people in this world whom either say things they wanna say that you admire them for their directness or have a sunny disposition who put you at ease. that type of combo cant be beat.
B00BWYFTNG|5.0|Great addition to our collection. We collect these figures, so we don't open them but every one of them have met our expectations. The maker of these figures does an excellent job of making them match the characters.  These are my two favorite characters in the series and it is cool that they offered them together. Great quality and worth the price
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|This is a fun version of the classic game. It has beautiful display and fun achievements! Definitely worth the purchase.
B00DERIV8Y|5.0|If you are collecting these figures, then this is one you must have. It is very detailed and realistic. This is my favorite one because it resembles Daryl the most. This would make a great gift for any Walking Dead fan.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|AMAZING! They have such a God-given talent!! This is a CD that, regardless of your taste in music, anyone will love!
B0035XVVDY|3.0|Remarkably strong beginning and middle but loses so much of tension in the end.  It seemed to care more about wrapping up the story as quickly as possible by some deus ex machina, and a sudden uncanny prescience on certain character's part.  Thankfully, the movie is put out of its misery before the shoddiness of it all ruined the experience.
B00APN48QY|4.0|It is entertaining and suspenseful, but I enjoyed the special features even more.  There is a lot on the true story in the special features.
B00FAX6XQC|3.0|I love the game but sometimes the animals don't actually show up on the screen but besides that keep doing what you're doing.
072325804X|5.0|Marked Like New but aside from being in shrink wrap it is basically brand new - never used. Comes with a sturdy cardboard protective sleeve. About the same size and weight as a school textbook. The illustrations are beautiful and so easily admired in this larger book (compared to the smaller books I owned as a child.) It did smell a little like glue, but that's probably from the cardboard sleeve. Shipped quickly. GREAT buy for the price!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Worked perfectly right out of the box. Took only a couple of minutes to set up and minutes later I was watching YouTube videos on the big screen. I've used it with Netflix and Pandora also with no problems.
B003MYYJD0|5.0|Big watch. If you like big faces then you will like this watch. I always get compliments. It is a bit heavy but not distracting at all. Band fits comfortably
B00FKAA3MA|5.0|Been a fan since day one.  This is the best one so far.  Any eminem fan will live this album.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Did not want to put down once I started reading.  You want to stay with this one to see what happens.
B009A9EQL6|5.0|WITH 5 DECADES FROM 1ST RELEASE, THEY STILL STILL ROCK THE BEST. I LVOE THIS RECORD AND AM PISSED IT DIDNT GET CALLED THE BEST OF THE YEAR.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|The packaging was great and I am so glad to have the different disc combo. Great christmas gift for all!
0525952926|5.0|WW2 TOLD SO WELL, EVEN THOUGH I KNEW THE HISTORY INSIDE OUT. I READ THE 1ST ONE FIRST, BUT ITS NOT NEEDED.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|A fun game with beautiful scenery and decent puzzles. If you get stuck on a puzzle, you can opt for a hint or even a complete solution. These features and a storyline keep the game moving. Although not a long game, it was enjoyable and worth the purchase price. I'd like to play more games like this one.
B00000JPYQ|5.0|THE HEIGHT OF 70'S HARD ROCK CHRONICLED HERE ON THIS FINE LIVE CD. THESE GUYS WERE AS FIERCE AS AEROSMITH. MICHAEL SCHENKER RULED WHEN HE WAS WITH THEM, BECAUSE THEY HAD A GREAT SINGER AS WELL AS GREAT BAND, AND RADIO PLAYED THEIR HITS
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is one of the best apps I have ever downloaded.  It has always works great on kindle fire hd and Google tablets.  I have had it on my cell phone for years.  I wish I could give you 10 stars.
031603438X|5.0|WONDERFULLY TOLD - SO FUNNY ITS AS IF WRITTEN BY MONTY PYTHON. HIS TIPS TO PLAY ARE PRICELESS TOO. OPEN G IS THE WAY!
0143124544|5.0|I bought this book at the Airport. I never heard of JoJo Moyes but I was curious of the title.<br />I could not put it down. I finished it within 2 days. Now I am ordering 3 more books of JoJo and hoping that they are as good as this one. You won't be disappointed. It will make you think by putting yourself in those different characters she smartly created. How would you handle it? Please read it. Thank you JoJo
B000002JSN|5.0|BEST RECORD THEY EVER DID. WHEN I WAS A 2 LP SET, ONE SIDE WAS AMAZING. NOW ITS DISC 1 - INCREDIBLE
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Hands down best game. I have lots of games on my kindle fire HD but this is seriously the best game on it and it was FREE. If you like superheroes  then you'll love this game.
B000QCS8TW|5.0|this book is a really good book it's my first book iv read and the story line is really good
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like the YouVersion BIBLE.  It is perfect for reading along with my Bible Study, at church and during my morning reading time.
0345803485|1.0|Don't waste your money. The author 's writing style is comparable with that of a teenager. The plot is almost non existent. The characters are unrealistic, he a billionaire, handsome abusive person (controlling, possessive, beats her up...). She, Ana is a virgin 21 year old, beautiful (of course) and with an eating disorder...she often &#34;forgets to eat throught the day. What kind of message is this giving to society? She has an orgasm every other page, the have sex around 6 times a day, to the point that gets boring to read. I bought the 3 books before I even knew how pathetic they were.  I'm struggling to read through the remaining of the other 2 books.
B00FEMJF6O|4.0|Having lots of fun playing this game it gives me something to look forward to do just wish it would t take so many coins to get stuff.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Great game. But would like to get all 5 lives restored when you beat a level and wait time to be reduced.
B00GX59QO2|2.0|Really weak, convoluted plot so lots of long action sequences you can easily fast forward through.  We didn't find ourselves caring about what was happening on the screen. Wish we had waited and seen it on TV, wasn't worth $3.99 rental.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I'm not a huge rap fan but I love this album. The lyrical content is refreshing and thoughtful - something that has been desperately lacking these days. The most popular song - Thriftshop (which is what introduced me to the album) isn't even close to being the best song on there... Neon Cathedral and Starting Over just give you chills.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|You would have done the same thing the jury did, but the buildup to it gives you far more insight than they were able to enjoy. This is small-town intrigue wrapped up in big moral issues, with just enough ambiguity to keep you guessing. And thinking.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun game that is simple, addictive, and the perfect mix of challenging for a casual game. I have it on both my Kindle and Smartphone.<br /><br />The challenges include matching three or more candies to complete level requirements like collecting ingredients or clearing jelly-covered spaces. Four or more in a match will give you a booster candy, and combining the booster candies gives you even better boosts.<br /><br />My complaint, and reason I won't give five stars? Because like too many games, this one is annoyingly limited in being able to access higher levels unless you're willing to log in to Facebook through the game and then &quot;spam&quot; your non-playing friends with &quot;help requests.&quot;<br /><br />First of all, if I wanted to play through Facebook, I would. And I absolutely refuse to bug friends just to play more of a game. Of course, if I don't want to do either, there is th option to buy the ext level. So basically, spam your friends or pay to play.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Loved this book could not stop reading it, my dad got on my case about how I should wait a day later to read it but, hell no I went on reading and finished this book in a day probably starting MokingJay tomorrow.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|No extra frills but fun. for an extra challenge you can work on the acheivements.  I havent had any freezing and if there have been ads they are so small i havent notuced them.
B00BAXFECK|5.0|I bought this novel to read on my Kindle because it's around 800 pages and I had to own it in order to have time to read it.  I was amazed it was only $7.40 on Amazon.  The opening section drew me right in: a bomb exploding in the Metropolitan Museum and the  main character searching for his mother in the turmoil.  He's told to grab this painting of the goldfinch.  Who wouldn't want to read further?  I have read Donna Tartt before and I think she's terrific.  She does not disappoint.
1591396190|2.0|SOME CASE EXAMPLES BEYOND THE OBJECTIVE SUCCESS OF THE IDEA BEHIND IT ARE...SIMPLY RIDICULOUS...SUSTAINING THAT A FAMOUS WINE BRAND IS A STORY OF TREMENDOUS SUCCESS IS TRUE BUT IS LIKE DEFENDING THE IDEA THAT SELLING CARBONATED DRINKS WAS A GREAT ONE AS WELL. TODAY THE WORLD DRINKS CARBONATED DRINKS BUT KNOWS THAT THEY ARE JUNK BEVERAGES.<br />AGAIN THE IDEA OF HITTING &#34;UNTAPPED MARKETS&#34; IS A GOOD ONE BUT THE EXAMPLES USED ARE QUESTIONABLES AND ETHNOCENTRIC...BASED ON MASS MARKETS AND NO QUALITY.
B0048WQDIE|5.0|I first read this book in the mid  60s. At that time I was most impressed with the extraordinary humor.  However my later readings really appreciated the satirical comments on both our politics and our society in general. This is an absolute read for anyone who has not read it before
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|NOT EFFECTIVE. WASTE OF TIME. IMPOSSIBLE TO DO A DECENT WORK WITH IT. LIMITED FUNCTIONALITY SWITCHING OR FINDING FUNCTIONS. LIMITED.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The world depicted is so effortlessly created, so easy to believe in and yet brilliantly complex.  The character of Katniss is beautifully inconsistent, and perfectly human in her lack of self understanding and the poignant struggle to figure out who she is.  A great read - over and over again.
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I have always enjoyed playing Free Cell and this app is easy to use and lets me just casually play
0670024856|3.0|The author is still struggling after her earlier success. It never really took off. Some of the scenarios seemed surreal.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Fun and just challenging enough. I could spend hours playing this! Would highly recommend it. It's free - you have nothing to lose.
B00DJUPLY8|1.0|Very basic.  too basic of a player for my use.  i was expecting a better player in view of the sophistication of current apps.
B000002VSN|3.0|I liked the movie and the songs seemed timeless and that is why I purchased this cd. I must say that I love this cd and listen to it often. Even if you are not a big fan of gospel music you will love this cd.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is Grisham's finest book since &#34;A Time to Kill&#34;.  I was thoroughly entertained from the first page to the last page.  It was a book that I hated to finish....I didn't want it to be over!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|But only if you are looking for joy in every note!!  These guys serve up the most awesome non-traditional traditional seasonal music yet!!  Thank you, Piano Guys!!
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This was a great book!  I was thoroughly entertained from start to finish, and loved the twist at the very end.  I have recommended this to others.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Amazing sounds of the seasons... and this time there are even a few voices thrown in... Love listening to it around the house and in my car!!! A must buy for any Piano Guy fan!!!
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I absolutely loved the first two books of this series..I couldn't put them down. I found myself bored when I was reading allegiant. I wanted more from the characters. I couldn't tell the difference between Tris and Tobias without the beginning of the chapter saying it was them. They both have two completely different personalities which was not shown. I was disappointed..I found myself hating Tobias during the book. I kept telling myself that these things aren't playing out as they should.<br />****spoiler alert******<br /><br />I cannot believe how the author killed off Tris..I was beyond devastated and annoyed by how it was done. A character I grew to absolutely love in the first two books just gone in an instant. Okay it was \\"selfless\\" but I still didn't like how it played out..all the things she made it through to die..it just didn't go well for me.<br /><br />I just wish she put the enthusiasm into this book like she did the first two. I'm disappointed in the way it played out but I don't regret reading the series.
B00BZAJMWG|5.0|Profound, funny, and compelling.  Creatively done and great acting.  One of the best movies I have seen in a while.
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Absolutely love The Piano Guys and their latest does not disappoint.  Their music has heart and soul as they take classics and give them a special holiday twist. When you watch them perform, whether live or on DVD, what clearly comes through is their love of the music and what they are doing.  This will reawaken your love of the classics.
B00CTKHXFO|5.0|If you are a diehard fan of Solid Snake then you already have these games. This is the same stuff that you get with the HD Collection (released last year) MGS4, and a voucher for MGS on the Playstation store. I have owned all MGS games on a combination of PS1, PS2, Gamecube, and PS3. That being said, if you know someone who likes MGS, then get them this if they do not already have these games. But there is nothing new here that you will get if you already own the games.<br /><br />That being said, 5 stars for MGS AWESOMENESS!
0399161287|5.0|“There is no sport in the world that is more passionate than fighting, when it is done correctly. You want to fight your brother or your father because the guy you’re rooting for is you. He’s representing your whole barometer about how you feel and think. Mixed martial arts are more popular than boxing now because you see so much passion in the cage. Boxers don’t have that passion anymore. There’s no guy that really has the heart to say “Not only do the gods deliver me and vex me, but one day I will reign with them.” Today’s guys don’t say that s***, they don’t have the balls, they spring from a milieu too meager to comprehend my kind of reality. They don’t want to do that because they’re afraid they will fail and people will laugh at them. That’s why today’s fighters don’t get the total respect because they’re afraid to really grab true greatness. They look at boxing as a check, they don’t see it as something noble. They want money and adulation. I wanted adulation and immortality.<br /><br />“What makes an exciting fighter is his ability and willingness to want to hurt the other man. That makes for great fights and superstars. When I was in the ring I projected myself as an animal. Like a dog in a pit, I was there to entertain the audience. The more I hurt someone, the quicker I hurt him, the more adulation I got from the crowd, and I fed off that. Today they don’t dream about hurting their opponents. It’s like the wussification of boxing. Sugar Ray Robinson, Rocky Marciano, those guys were going to die for that belt, you’d have to kill them to get it from them.”<br /><br />This book was incredible.<br /><br />The best way for a famous person to write a memoir is to really tell ALL, and many famous persons (looking at you, Jay-Z) fall short of this for whatever reason — some can’t speak on street/illegal life, some just don’t want to tell all, some are just not that type to expose their entire lives, which will all feature the good at the bad and the ugly. It takes a certain type of individual to put all of that out there for public judgement. Mike Tyson is that type of person.<br /><br />Prodigy was the best tell-all I’d read up to now and Ice-T is right up there also. Mike, however, took the cake, ate it, and s*** it out, all right in front of you.<br /><br />Undisputed covers Mike Tyson’s entire life, and what makes it different and better than the rest is the fact that Mike Tyson has lived a wilder life than that of any person’s book I’ve read. From his rough childhood in Brownsville, Brooklyn of stealing, robbing, and  battering to being battered, robbed and stolen from. To his adolescent life of guns, arrests, living and eating on the streets. To discovering boxing, to being discovered by Cus D’Amato and turned into the youngest heavyweight champion in the history of the sport. The championships, the money, cars, women, travels, marriages, divorces, rape cases, incarcerations, drugs, downfalls, redemptions, and then doing it all over again, Undisputed basically takes everything I have ever done in life and has Mike tell me how he did it 100x more than me, in a page-turning way through a relatively long book (almost 2,000 pages in the iOS version).<br /><br />In case you were wondering: Undisputed goes in-depth on Robin Givens (the poster image for gold-digging women, like it or not), Desiree Washington (poster image for money-hungry rape accusers), Don King (poster image for the gangsterism of contracts), and Mike himself (a self-described extremist who did too much of everything he ever did/does). Mike Tyson has played many roles — womanizer (x100), drug addict, alcoholic, deadbeat dad, user, use-ee, lavish spender, cash cow, broke bum, and more that I cannot even remember since Undisputed is just so full of stories. Mike is not afraid of telling you everything about himself and his is painfully honest throughout the book. Other names/stories that make an appearance: Rick James (the Chappelle Show story? Mike was there), Eddie Murphy, Iceberg Slim, Barbara Streisand, 50 Cent (the guy who allegedly shot 50 was Mike’s best friend), the Hangover guys.<br /><br />If you read/gift one book this year, this is the one. Trust me.Mike was there), Eddie Murphy, Iceberg Slim, Barbara Streisand, 50 Cent (the guy who allegedly shot 50 was Mike’s best friend), the Hangover guys.    If you read/gift one book this year, this is the one. Trust me.
B00BNUBK46|4.0|There are better headlamps out there for more money, but for what you pay, you're getting a good deal. The flood function alone is worth the price. On high, the flood function lights up my whole front yard. The spot light on full power is also very bright. So bright that you can't use it up close. I get that it has spec sheets and all that, but from what I've seen first hand, the spot light puts out usable light up to at least 150 yards, which seems impossible for a light this size. It's comparable to my full size maglite LED in terms of output. The front, where the bulbs are, is much slimmer than other headlamps where the batteries are stored up front, so it won't get caught on stuff as easily.<br /><br />So far the only downside to this headlamp is that the tilt gearing feels cheap. I have a feeling it's going to wear out prematurely.
B008JFUP0I|5.0|R.I.P. Paul Walker!!!! fast and furious movies was awesome i really enjoyed these movies. i cant wait till this comes in next week. i really want to see it.
0756407915|5.0|one of the best books i have ever read. after reading the game of thrones books, i needed something similar yet different. read the name of the wind in about two weeks (because im lacking on time.) it was great. immediately attacked this book and am dying for more. such a good story with great characters.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Great character development - Walter and Alter, Olivia and Fauxlivia, Astrid and all the names Walter comes up to call her, with Peter and Astrid holding it all together ( and don't forget the cow, too.)... brilliant stuff!  All are diverse and fit well together.  The storyline is gripping - never know what to expect. Each year is like watching an entirely different show.
B00GRPD0J0|5.0|GREAT APP! IT is worth getting. Like the features and it is easy to navigate through the tabs. Get the app.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It's a great game that is so addictive and fun.  With all the many levels, you can keep going and going.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I would give a five but I don't care for the advertisements.  Especially the videos. they are hard to shut down.
0321811984|5.0|This is a book that can be read cover to cover, or dipped into after the event. I had Reynolds' other book &#34;The Naked Presenter&#34; which completely changed the way in which I went about running presentations (for the better). I was keen to get this book to improve the quality of my slides. Essential for anyone who performs public speaking or does presentations (even if it's only 1-2 per year)
B007VUCAVO|4.0|very good little app.....lots of information about battery usage, battery life and what uses up the battery on your kindle
B000P0J09W|5.0|I loved this movie when I was a kid and still do. For me, this is the cinematic version of comfort food.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Good read, not what I was expecting but very good.. thank you.enjoyed the series.. can't wait for the next series.
B00CKOYVG8|3.0|It's fun while playing the practice part but since I'm new to Kindle I didn't realize I had to have friends to play it with me which I don't have. I am not a facebook person so I can only play the short practice parts of this game.
B0041OT9W6|5.0|This is one of my favorite books ever. It was very honest and descriptive about life in the Secret Annex. I was very impressed with the quality of the writing and the level of philosophical revelation in this book. Anne was a very inspiring person and this book captured that. This is a great read for middlr school and up.
B001BANK32|5.0|Stephan King is my favorite author.  I enjoy easy reading where I don't have to remember too many details and too many flashbacks and flashforwards and so far with what I have read of his books it is always a good time.
B0016BPWNM|5.0|I LOVE this movie  it's exactly what I was looking for! It was in great shape no scratches, undamaged case, and speedy delivery! Think I'll go watch it right now.
B0007MAJBQ|5.0|I still listen to music on my minidisc player and record with it.  This product is produced anymore, but if you have a chance to get one, do it.  It's really better than the regular CD and it saves space.
B00459GJUM|5.0|Great season. Perfect cast.  Perfect for past time.<br />Great all around. Perfect in its hummor.<br />Glad to have such a great season on my hold.
0385350864|3.0|There are definitely some laugh out loud moments in this new Bridget Jones but it's definitely not as good as the first or second.  Helen Fielding does a good job of keeping up with technology and the changing world since the original books but the story is just not as interesting.<br /><br />I mourn Mark Darcy.
B002ZXGSWE|5.0|Great all arround.<br />Great for past time watching.<br />Easy to access, and a awesome movie and cast.<br /><br />Only regret is that there is not a third season.
B00FN811SY|5.0|It is an amazing app. When you tap the actually Bible verse number it will give the same scripture in 5 other translations and you can see for yourself how much more understandable the NWT Bible is
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|play this all the time on facebook and am so happy to have it on my kindle to link up with facebook. thank y'all so much. anyone who has played it on computer must have it on mobile, it's the same game just on the go. happy crushin candy fans!!!!!!!!
B002BI4JLU|1.0|weird weird weird<br />waste of money<br />Smithsonian blew this one<br />the music, the narration...so very strange<br />not sure what the message was
B00GIZO674|5.0|Great time management game that increases the challenge at a great pace. Relax mode is a fun time waster. Graphics good too. Definitely recommend.<br />.
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Amazing! This novel is long, but well worth it. You take a journey of Kaladin as well as some of the royals. You follow them through many different trials. There's magic in this book...but it's more of a story with a little bit of magic instead of a super fantasy. There's some violence.
B004T4LUPW|5.0|What I was looking for in a calendar. I have other calendars which needed to be displayed that could not be synced by the built in kindle calendar.  These included the holiday, NFL, NBA, as well as my wife's calendars which showed on my web google calendar. Now I have all of the information exactly as I the setup of my web google calendar. It syncs very well.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I am not sure why anyone would rate this less than 5 stars.  The gameplay is addicting.  The graphics are appealing.  And I am completely surprised to say this, but the music is pleasant.  40 levels in and I still haven't muted it.<br /><br />If you enjoy games like flow or ladies, then pick this one up.  You will not be disappointed.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|What more can I say.  It is a Baldacci book.  There area so many.  We have not read this one yet but I know it will be a hot one.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Plenty of twists and turns to keep you guessing. Characters continue to change throughout which makes you reconsider each character regularly. Definitely a non-conventional ending but leaves you wanting more to the story.
B000FA5STS|5.0|We have not read this one yet.  Why did I give it such a rating?  It is a David Baldacci book.  Any and everything he writes is worth the best rating.  I know when we do it will not disappoint us.
B004LROUNG|2.0|The Litigators was a bit tiresome to read.  I. had to skip a large section.  I do like happy endings and this filled the bill,except i seemed to be anti-climactic.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|One of the best.  I had a friend suggest this one and I am so glad she did.  I have a lot of fun with this one.  I just have a little more to learn about it.
B00CDTSFF8|5.0|great story of Viking life.  costumes and setting for story very authentic, beautiful landscape.  Enjoyed watching the struggle and out come of what the character went through.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So much fun.  There are times I just can't put it down.  I always say just one more game.  Huh.  Maybe 5 more games.
B005HSL626|5.0|Awesome! Wonderful Colors, no purchases, ads, or pop-ups. Great App for Adults and Kids of all ages. I never remove it, and have it on all my devices.
B004TI5N38|5.0|My husband is a big  Baldacci fan and now can find the books he has not yet read.  I get them second hand
B004I8WD7S|5.0|This is probably the best case you can buy for the price. It looks simple enough but holds strong and has protected my phone from many drops onto the concrete.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|The book is extremely interesting, but most of all, this book is a very important book. Every person that goes to sleep in his warm and clean bed with a full stomach, and dreams sweat, normal, dreams, should read this book!!!! The world should BE AWARE to what is really going on in places like North Korea.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I came to The Hunger Games trilogy as a late comer, not wanting to be swept up in the craze of the wave that was sweeping readers everywhere. The story line is so captivating and as with any good read, tremendously meaningful. This last installment especially as it plays with the idea that the end does not justify the means. A brilliant end and new beginning to a grand story.
0802473156|5.0|This book explained so much. It wasn't just about how to love your spouse better but also how to get along with everyone else in your life better. It really helped me understand people better. Now to get my husband to read it....
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Good game. I love the various amount of dragons.<br />There are good grafics and fun games and challenges to overcome.  Is worth the FREE downlod. I love that word.
B0074VTHKM|5.0|This book was very entertaining and detailed I think that if you like mysteries you should read this book Read it
0671449028|5.0|Love this book!! We read it every single night to our 3 year old, now she has it memorized and &#34;reads&#34; along. Boynton books are great!
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|I just got my cd yesterday and I love it.  So relaxing and peaceful.  Beautiful music that I will hate to put away at the end of the season.
B00G70J81O|3.0|I just got a look at the excel spreadsheet of the prisoner list of Hiroshima POW Camp 6 provided by one of the far east POW websites.<br /><br />As mentioned by a Canadian POW, the Japanese would periodically update the POW photos and records.<br /><br />Those records contain their full names, their next of kin and their home addresses.<br /><br />And I know from the POW memoirs I own that very often American former POWs would find themselve approached by their former Japanese gaolers and in every memoir, the former POWs claim that they accepted the now remorseful just doing his job former tormentor and killer.<br /><br />I also read that Navajo code talkers were contacted decades later by Japanese enemy combatants.<br /><br />So in light of these facts especially that they maintained records on each prisoner including their next of kin usually their wives (and they were so nice to the wives of the British in Hong Kong) and the home addresses, then THIS Wolverine movie is about Japan as deadly frenemy.<br /><br />That's why the Vincent Price lookalike narrator of Cinemasins dings the fact that Wolverine with his heightened senses appears to not SMELL Yukio's presence exactly as he seemed to not SMELL Rogue hiding in his vehicle in the first X-Men movie.<br /><br />He is silent and well mannered as his arm is twisted to fly to Tokyo to see his \\"old friend\\" his former gaoler who still calls him by an insulting name and pretty much all the Japanese are disrespectful, discourteous and not at all good hosts to him.<br /><br />The original clueless review of a temporary piece of brain candy:<br /><br />I couldn't figure out if this was the only way to get the digital copy of the Extended/Unleashed version with the extra minutes that every review claims makes this movie better.<br /><br />I don't think this movie is worth five dollars nevermind the extra six dollars in order to see the extended but I decided to not upsell myself up to a multidisc with digital copy becausesince I don't think much of the movie, I have decided to pay the lowest price to get what I genuinely want i..e the extended version.  For the same price, the iTunes version is better because it provides extras BUT here is where ROKU's power is evident.  I simply want to be able to jump from netflix to Amazon Instant Video via the wonderfully responsive  Roku remote.<br /><br />I have the original issues (worthless since they are worn from reading and time) and this movie just is not attractive.  Hugh Jackman always seems too ... poreless to be Wolverine but I do like Liev Schreiber as Sabretooth (he's not in this movie).  COINCIDENTALLY, Liev Schreiber played Hugh Jackman's descendant in this director's [[ASIN:B007SSDBBM Kate And Leopold]].  Go figure.<br /><br />The Amazon Instant Video showed up right away on the Roku so there was no problem.<br /><br />I committed to buying the extended version based on this review:<br /><br />http://www.amazon.com/review/R3BMEOALOEUN2E/ref=cm_cr_dp_title?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B00E4W40C4&channel=detail-glance&nodeID=2625373011&store=movies-tv<br /><br />but in hindsight, the extra gore may not have made this movie better but at least we know.<br /><br />To me, the best thing about this film is the Russian actress who plays Viper who was lovelier without the heavy makeup in [[ASIN:B0059XTTW8 Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy]].  Here, despite her laudably perfect American accent and delivery (unlike Yukio's inappropriate echoing of Scott Summers' \\"You're still a ....\\" line to Wolverine), she is definitely Russian and her scene in the street both with the random harasser and the ninja echo the disrespect the Russian female expats experience in Japan and the ninja's threat of giving her a Glasgow smile actually happened to female victims of the Japanese invasion of Asia.<br /><br />This movie despite being set in and about Japan is clearly about the frenemy relationship between the Allies and the Axis.  The villain's offspring are all trained against the kuzuri and you will want to rewatch the film to note all the dishonesty and feigned friendship.<br /><br />It would explain why the residence of the family and the movements of the inhabitants resemble that of a stage play.<br /><br />Interestingly, given Logan's longevity and life experiences, it would not be unlikely that he spots this a mile away as well as enduring Jean Grey's constant psychic trespassing imploring him to suicide.<br /><br />Very much like Pico Iyer, Professor X and Wolverine leave their love interests in [[ASIN:B00BGARGR8 Another Country]].<br /><br />For the first time, I found myself liking Hugh Jackman when his character was amusingly sneaky by meekly repeating the standard phrase before eating at the table followed by stabbing his chopsticks upright into his bowl of rice.  Now would he stab his fork into a slice of pot roast and leave it like the American flag planted on the Moon?  So why would he do that to the rice with the chopsticks if not to invite the common CHINESE admonishment followed by the statement from a very unTunguistic looking Japanese fashion model \\"Nothing is without meaning.\\"<br /><br />Well, that stand-in for incense in a bowl in front of the portrait of the deceased is placed OPPOSITE the Japanese female that Wolverine shortly beds a la Mickey Rourke in [[ASIN:B004427L2U Year of the Dragon]].  And that is why the Chinese character in [[ASIN:B004LB5FDQ The Hawaiians]] becomes Charlton Heston's business partner and a Japanese field hand becomes his wife.<br /><br />The extras in the Japanese crowd scenes look intentionally outdated as if this were set in the 1970s but the technology is modern.  Coincidentally, Wolverine starred in [[ASIN:B004A8ZWW4 Real Steel]] echoing the final Boss fight  - also against a Japanese/Russian team.<br /><br />Viper was characterized very well in this film - much better and of course, more glamorously than Ray Park's Toad in the X Men movie.<br /><br />__________<br /><br />At least Silver Samurai was SMART enough to make the right gesture at the beginning of the film and release the POWs when the bombing started:<br /><br />TOKYO PRISON ATROCITY<br /><br />Towards the end of the Pacific War, the execution of captured Allied aircrews became almost automatic. Courts-martial were dispensed with on orders from the Military Police Headquarters. In the Tokai Military District, twenty-seven airmen were executed by firing squad, but often, less humane methods were used. In the Japanese Army Prison in Tokyo all the buildings were built of wood and into this prison were crammed 464 Japanese soldiers serving sentences. Also confined in the prison were 62 American airmen who earlier were shot down and captured. During the night of May 25, 1945, Tokyo was heavily bombed by the US Air Force and the prison was hit by incendiaries. In the conflagration which followed, all the 62 airmen were burned to death. A significant factor in this incident was that none of the Japanese prisoners or any of the prison guards suffered a similar fate. The failure of the Japanese to release the 62 flyers could only have been deliberate.<br /><br />http://www.irishexaminer.com/ireland/our-man-in-nagasaki-film-to-unlock-secret-of-the-samurai-296674.html

B00FAI2IUM|1.0|Can't use interior view...keeps defaulting back to exterior. Was offered a time limited challenge which disappeared within about two hours before I could progress far enough to win the prize (but of course after I spent coin on the required car). Lake Como is virtually impossible to win, even with a fully upgraded car. Bottom line - I think the kindle version needs some work to fix glitches and make the physics of the game challenging without being impossible.

B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|Coming off of the undisputedly high success achieved on 2009’s excellent comeback, “Black Gives Way To Blue,” Seattle’s Alice In Chains return with their second album with somebody else that is not named Layne Staley behind the mic (the late,  great Staley passed away in 2002). 2013’s “The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here” is not quite as heavy or powerful as that now four year old epic, but it is still an excellent effort, overall. It augments very heavy and meaty, doom soaked guitar chops and Black Sabbath-influenced rhythms with stellar, tuneful vocals and a distinctly old-school-esque, grunge-derived attitude.<br /><br />Part of its key to success is variety, as there is plenty of song-to-song diversity and individual track identity present here, spread out over the course of these twelve tracks. And furthermore, “The Devil” is also very noteworthy in that it contains absolutely no stinkers -- not a single one, folks! Indeed, even the record’s most vapid and/or boring songs (see “Breath On A Window,” which discontinues a mid-album trend of Tom Morello-esque air-guitar-worthiness, and the largely unremarkable set closer, “Choke”) are not bad by any stretch of the imagination. And as one final point towards “The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here” being a classic, the album gets better with repeat listens too, thus being a surefire sign of timelessness (or, if nothing else, then at least long-lasting quality.)<br /><br /> “Hollow,” boasts a heavy, head-banging sludge/doom metal main riff iced by melodic, oh-so-Layne-esque vocals that, along with its solid, grumbling bass notes, make the number, the album opener, evoke vintage Alice In Chains. Of course this is not the only song to do so, as the succeeding “Pretty Done” also brings to mind memories of “Dirt”-era AIC, and its insanely catchy and immediately memorable chorus propels its status as being a potential hit single. Next up, “Stone” boasts some noteworthy bass work (an excellent bass intro included) that, when augmented by some air-guitar-able, “wah-wah” heavy guitar hooks, and current frontman William DuVall’s trademark vocals, combine together to form another extremely infectious mini-epic.<br /><br />The album then explores its softer and more sensitive side, with “Voices” being a bluesy and somber acoustic strummer highlighted by another hit-single-worthy vocal pattern, as well as some memorable lyrics and choruses; and the title track sounding like it could be the sequel to AIC’s twenty-one year-old hit single “Rooster” (or “Angry Chair”), thanks to its use of lonely, depressing acoustic-strummed guitars and melodically dreary-sounding vocals.  “Lab Monkey” is a piece of extremely dark and morose grunge metal in excelsis, although it is highlighted by an unorthodoxly ripping, “wah-wah”-heavy guitar solo; and “Low Ceiling,” with its heavy, hooky, crunching guitar licks and bit of what is perhaps the record’s best and lengthiest and most sustained guitar soloing, continues this mid-album, air-guitar-worthy trend.<br /><br />Later on, “Scalpel” sounds almost like it could be an outtake from the “Jar Of Flies” recording sessions, as it is a touching piece of emotional power balladry that boasts one of the album’s best and brightest and most infectious melodies. But “Phantom Limb” then promptly brings the metal back in full-stride, what with its tasty, crunching, chug and churn riffing, staccato, lurching rhythms, and surprisingly wild and shredding solo work. But the album then returns to its very grungy hard rock roots with “Hung On A Hook” being an extremely dark, murky, and brooding number, and a shoo-in for being the record’s final standout.<br /><br />“Devil” might not be quite as great or nearly as important as past greats like the already noted “Dirt” and/or “Black Gives Way To Blue,” but it doesn’t need to be. It is a rock solid, very consistent, and all-in-all pretty darn dynamite album, and one that ought to be considered an essential purchase for just about every hard rock and heavy metal fan out there today.retty darn dynamite album, and one that ought to be considered an essential purchase for just about every hard rock and heavy metal fan out there today.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is awesome. It is a great game if you want to build. But I think that it you should get mine carts and horses, like in PC. You should also be able to switch between survival and create.
B00A8ZZ2Z0|5.0|One of the earliest power metal groups in existence, and an obvious influence on bands like 3 Inches Of Blood, Dragonforce, Iced Earth, and Gamma Ray, Germany’s Helloween have been kicking out one piece of epic, if not entirely original, traditional metal after another for the better part of three decades now. The kind of music they play is aggressive and heavy power metal with a serious Judas Priest and Iron Maiden hard on, although the band also incorporate some of their own uniqueness and originality to the mix to help keep things fresh.<br /><br />Helloween’s fourteenth proper album is fifteen tracks of epic power metal, filled with fifteen tracks, and none of them are interludes, skits, or even anything less than full-fledged songs that are less than three minutes and twelve seconds long (the only exception to this rule being “Wanna Be God,” which is dedicated to the memory of Queen singer Freddy Mercury.) As a result, “Straight Out Of Hell” can come across sounding a little overwhelming to some listeners, as it is a bit of a horsepill of an album, and is most certainly not anything really accessible or commercial. But this is just Helloween’s way of doing things: It is their own innovative stamp on songwriting. Hence, the songs are very smartly written, and it seems almost a little redundant to say that they are brilliantly, expertly-well performed, too.<br /><br />The record begins with “Nabatea.” This propulsive set opener gets by mainly on crunchy speed metal riffing, Bruce Dickinson-worshipping vocals, and huge, soaring choruses, although some nicely harmonic soloing also finds its way into the mix, as does plenty of rhythmic and galloping drum beats. “World Of War” is an even more shred-tastic inclusion, as it boils over with blistering, crunching chainsaw riffs, piercing melodic solos, and technically-impressive, air-guitar-able leads. But track number five, “Burning Sun,” is even bigger and shreddy-er still. Pounding drum fills and Rob Halford-inspired vocals abound, here, but the track is mostly of note for featuring fiery, rip-roaring metal riffage and some of the album’s best guitar solo work -- and what deliciously twiddly, epic, and melodic soloing it is, too!<br /><br />Elsewhere, a track like “Far From The Stars,” with its catchy, staccato, lurching beat and locomotive chugging, coupled together with frontman Andi Deris’ tuneful melodic vocals, make the tune sound very much like an Iron Maiden b-side or cover song. With that said, though, most of the album possesses Helloween’s signature, unique sound. Take “Hold Me In Your Arms,” for example. It might not be an exactly groundbreaking ballad, but it certainly is an excellent one, and one that stands out from the rest of the pack. Here, a gorgeous string arrangement and some tranquil piano keys combine together with accomplished and proper (and, at times, even nearly soulful) clean singing to create one extremely rich, luscious, and nicely-textured musical soundscape.<br /><br />The anthemic title song is another standout (just try to get the part where the soaring melodic vocals recite the song’s title phrase out of your head), as is “A******,” thanks to it being filled with an abundance of crunchy, biting, chug and churn guitar licks and memorably wailing, air-guitar-able soloing. And one other shout out has got to go to the “Hammond Version” of  “Burning Sun,” a thrashy album closer with Rob Halford-approved clean singing, inspiring, epically pyrotechnic guitar shredding, and epic, infectious choruses.<br /><br />With that said, though, “Straight Out Of Hell” is actually at its best and most identifiable when it is both brutal and melodic. The oh-so-aptly-entitled “Make Fire Catch The Fly” is one example of such an occasion, as is a ripper that is blistering yet also retains a certain level of tunefulness throughout. And it is also of note for featuring some Judas Priest-meets-Kreator-esque vocal patterns. And so is “Church Breaks Down,” an epic that offsets ominously symphonic/orchestral sounding flourishes with forceful double-time drumming and thrashy picking, thus creating another song that is heavy and intense, yet simultaneously quite harmonic.<br /><br />Quite likely the best traditional and power metal release in all of 2013, &#34;Straight Out Of Hell&#34; is a very highly recommended to all fans of traditional and power metal. Surprised? Why the heck should you be when this is, after all, Hello-friggin’-ween we are talking about here (!), the band that this reviewer would seriously be willing to bet that he would see Hell freeze over before he sees them making even one single bad or flavorless piece of music.al patterns.

B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Great graphics and fun to kill time. Takes awhile to learn. Not sure how to learn some aspects of the game. Around the world player's adds. To the interest.
B00FR0GT9Y|4.0|OK, I'll show my age and say that I vividly remember my teenage years growing up in Rhode Island and buying the first Boston album when it came out in 1976 and devouring the music inside.  Admittedly, this new album is not as fresh and new as that first record,  but \\"Life, Love, and Hope\\" delivers on the Boston sound in spades and that's what I love.  Great playing and singing by a number of Tom Scholz's friends (including the late, great Brad Delp) and just a fun record all around.  Get it!!

B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Awesome read, if you are into this genre.  Can get little rough in areas but I liked it a lot.  Can't wait for the next one.
0446691437|4.0|I'm a big fan of Pressfield's novels.  He's a former Marine and it is really apparent in just about everything he writes, but especially so when he writes about the Spartans in his two great books &#34;Gates of Fire&#34; and &#34;Tides of War.&#34;  This self-help book is very helpful in tackling the important creative projects in your life.  It's still, however, not quite the magic pill I was looking for.  (I was really hoping he'd offer to come over to my house and offer to do my work for me!)<br /><br />I was put off a bit though by his possible belief in muses and multiple gods. I think he may have spent too much time with his ancient Greeks.  I'm a Christian and have to pass on prayers to any other dieties but the One.  But still, I really like the guy though.
B00ADS98FC|5.0|my daughter has watched this once a week since purchase just for listening to the singing ; movie a little cheeky but sometimes you need to just watch a movie for some laughs, music etc; I have watched it twice myself.
B000HT3PPG|5.0|Still a movie classic. Christmas wouldn't be the same without this magical film to warm the holidays. Re-make is really just as good, depending upon your personal taste.
B00FLNRN06|3.0|a few moments of laughter but not as good as I thought it was going to be; worth to watch once and maybe again in 2 years
B000I9VOO4|5.0|Great classic film on the evils of segregation and the power of one man to champion an innocent against the accusations of members of the prevailing white class. Such simplicity of form and thought is seldom seen in movies today, except, perhaps, in the rare instance of an Erin Brochovich fighting corporate greed.
B005I6EU7U|5.0|This is a beautiful case the really adds some class to your Kindle Fire.  Fits the Kindle Fire perfectly.  Is easy to put on and remove.  Have had this case for quite some time and it looks just as good as it did when I first placed it on the Kindle.

0439813786|5.0|I found this book at the school library, but it was hard to rent it. It was very popular. The time I finally got this book by Brian Selznick, I read it right away.<br /> The main character is Hugo, and he lives in Paris. He is living alone, and he has no money, so he has to steal many things. He tried to steal a toy from a toyshop to get some gears, but got caught by the owner and his notebook was taken. The owner looked surprised at the drawings in the notebook-the drawing of the automaton. He seemed to know something about it.<br /> My favorite seen is when the automaton completes and moves in some way. It makes a marvelous something. You’ll know it after you read it.<br /> I recommend this to all ages. It has a lot of pages, but actually, a lot of is made of pictures. You can enjoy the text and the pictures with ease.<br /> I hope you read this book soon.
B001AQO3QA|3.0|It's all the movies.  I do not know what more to say about it than that so have a nice day.
0762445262|4.0|Very small but I knew that from the reviews so I was happy with the product. I actually bought this for a birthday gift and he loved it. (He's an adult, haha.) Probably one of his favorite gifts. Would recommend this for Batman fans. But please be warned it is very small as the description says.
0399157573|2.0|I used to love this series, and have reread the first 3 books numerous times. Around the 5th book or so I started to get the sense that the novels were being written more to profit the author and publisher rather than out of creative impulse. For the next 5 or so books quality varied but I was never bored by them. Now I find them dull and I read each one out of a fading hope that the heights of the first few books will b reached again.<br /><br /> I finished this book 2 days ago and can remember nothing of the plot or new characters. All I remember is a long dreary book in which there is a lot of tell but no show.  Scarpetta makes a lot of assumptions about what others are thinking or feeling, the brilliant Lucy does something predictably stupid and potentially disastrous, Marino's an unhappy boor. It adds up to very little.<br /><br />My main impression of the book is the sense of persecution that has pervaded this series from the beginning. This persecution complex is the overriding theme of these books now and it is just tedious. Scarpetta can trust no one, even those few people close to her and seemingly the whole world is out to get her. These books were so much more...I'm not sure they can be again.
B00G2KV92U|1.0|Come on guys!! This is RUBBISH. Sounds like Tom just doesnt care any more. They should be sued for false advertising. This is NOT my Rock and Roll Band...

B00CWY76CC|2.0|This game is not very good. I think there may be glitches. It doesn't work on my Kindle Fire HD very well at all. I try to hit objects and unlock passcodes and it acts like I'm not clicking anything. If they could fix the glitches it would maybe be fun. I would not recommend this to my friends
B008JFUO36|4.0|it was good but not as good as they made it sound.<br />  on the cover, there were many flattering adjectives used  to describe  this movie. I think they fell short.<br />  1-intense. this wasn't exactly  a war movie or a psychological thriller, so no.<br />  2-spectacular-yes-there were some great visuals and neat ideas.<br />  3-ground breaking. no. while the movie was very pretty and  very full of  great science stuff, there wasn't anything going on I haven't seen before.<br />  4-visually stunning-yes. this movie was full of &#34;lord of the rings&#34; worthy graphics with the awesome epic scale back drops and what not. it is very beautiful for many scenes and is pretty for  stretches sometimes adding to the overall entertainment and artistic value.<br />  5- mind blowing-no. it takes a lot to really blow a mind. while there are a lot of unexpected things going on. i'd call it more ironic than mind blowing. there were a few places that made me go, &#34;whooooooaaaahhhhh, dude!&#34; but no mind blowing.the cover also says he will &#34;question everything he knows&#34;. that is true.so I was waiting for a big ending like say any of these movies....&#34;planet of the apes&#34;, &#34;total recall&#34;, &#34;matrix revelutions &#34;  &#34;death race 2000&#34;, &#34;1984&#34; , &#34;a midsummers night dream&#34;, &#34;2001: a space odyssey&#34; or &#34;fight club&#34;. of course, I cant tell so you will just have to watch. its worth it.,<br />  this is morgan freemans third movie I know of where he gets to be a  great mind. the others are Lucius fox from the second batman trilogy and  when he played  GOD  in &#34; bruce almighty&#34;.  this character is Morpheus like. Morpheus is the black guy in the &#34;matrix&#34; movies.<br />  on the cover, it says that tom cruise finds a beautiful stranger. the chick he's already with was very  very pretty. she had a nice body, not trashy, but nice. she had really pretty eyes and a heart melting smile. what did he even need thisnew woman for ? someone was mixed up there. I did not like that part.<br />  this movie is about a guy who can pilot spacecrafts in a post apocalyptic earth. THINK  &#34;terminator&#34; meets &#34;top gun&#34;.<br />  all in all its pretty good. it made my top 85 movies of all time list.its a lot better than a lot of the junk that's been coming out lately. so its refreshing and fun.<br />  one mistake that was made is that sometimes when they show tom cruise flying around nearby wreckage to repair drones, the wreckage is of new York and sometimes Washington DC. but he's never gone long.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|This game is fun to play. Passes the time and its very easy. They keep updating it, so there are always new levels and vehicles to try to unlock.

B00386EZJU|5.0|One of the best movie soundtracks ever. It had music in chronological order and it had just about all of the music throughout the entire movie. There wasn't a weak track on the album.
B00EL8JCGU|4.0|I thought it was a great movie and couldn't figure out why there was so much negative press surrounding it when it was released. Sure, it's not the book, but how many movie adaptions have been able to live up to the original book?  Lots of action. Recommended.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I have read this book twice now and I love it even more. I have seen the first movie and it was a little disappointing, but usually the book is always better. I want to read other books by Suzanne Collins.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I have tried others but Clean Master does what it says it skip do. It will clean both memory and storage.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book will forever change my life and be in my heart. I can not put into words the ways of this book. The literal of it. The word. letter after letter formed into a word. A word to word which created a scar that can never be weakened.
B003BWERF8|2.0|Cheaply made. First it started to lose connection while being in my pocket with my iPod and then eventually broke apart. But I was outside doing work. If you had this sitting on a desk all day then it will probably last. But to go jogging or something, it won't last long. Buy a pair of BT headphones instead. Or something similar to this but seems more durable. This also has the potential to damage your device if say you have that end down in your pocket and could bend or damage the pins in your iDevice.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|What I like most about this app was #1 it was a free app and it provides easy access to facebook.
0804161380|5.0|This is absolutely fantastic. When I picked up the amazon box at the door, I was taken by surprise by its weight...perhaps I should've looked at that in the description! I gently opened it and unsnapped the magnetic seal to reveal a gorgeous gold-plated bookmark with etched logos. The hardcover guides are beautiful with gilded edges and he certificate of authenticity is nicely tucked away in an envelope. As others have said, it would be nice if they included room for A Link Between Worlds, but it's not that big a deal. If you are a diehard Zelda fan, GET THIS WHILE YOU CAN!

B0092S4WLY|4.0|I really like this game. It is fun and challenging.  It is almost like &quot;Escape The Room&quot;.  I wish there were more levels though.
B00BUVPIRS|3.0|Great game. I want to buy it on the OUYA but I could not resist the $.99c sale here in the appstore. But it appears moga support is missing in this version.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|I was a bit hesitant when I purchased this movie, but I was very surprised.  I loved it!  I would recommend seeing it if you haven't already.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Great app.  Not sure how we lived before Google.  I my household when a question is ask no one has the answer too someone will say Google it.  With speech to text life is GOOD, you don't even have to be able to spell a word right.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this game is very fun and addicting but when you get keys and coins and use them up, the game keeps pestering you to get more coins or keys, which obviously you can get them with your own real money or gradually play the game to get a few of these items slowly. so this game is fun, but there is too much pushy selling going on.
B003JTHWJQ|4.0|While the end of this book seems to wander a little off topic (but is still interesting), overall a good read.  Re-affirmed a lot of what I had come to believe myself, and brought up many points which had been rattling around inside of my head for a long time.<br /><br />Not going to go into my personal beliefs in a review.  I can just say the book is very well written and well thought out.  For the most part, Dawkins actually refrained from talking about himself too much.  I would be interested to hear / see a direct rebuttal to this book by someone in the religious community.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|the free app is better. it is the same thing! why pay if you can have the same thing for free?!

B00A81NFAS|5.0|This is the best modern American movie in a very long time - excellent ensemble cast, great writing and directing.  Perfect casting, fun and interesting characters.  A perfect movie, really!!!  Can be watched many, MANY times and still enjoyed because there is so much you miss on a first, second and third viewing.  Can't say enough good things about this movie, and besides all of this, it is uplifting and puts you in excellent spirits!!!
B00G70K1HY|5.0|Excellent movie.  Perfect depiction of Wolverine.  Violent and bloody and full of true-to-Wolverine dialogue.  Hey, bub.  There are more than a few scenes in this movie that are worth rewinding and re-watching.  It's that well done.  This movie is more adult, as it should be; and puts Wolverine into quite a few bad places.  We get to see why he is a true hero.  It's not his healing factor.  It's not his claws.  Because Wolverine loses his powers for a while and still prevails through a series of suspenseful scenes that make you admire him for WHO he is, not for what his mutant abilities or adamantium upgrades are.<br /><br />The Silver Samurai is not like the comics version, but it is still pretty scary.  He's all adamantium!  You can guess how that makes things on Wolverine.<br /><br />The acting is perfect.  Jackman brings Wolverine to life.  The effects are stunning.  Just a great production that you cannot miss if you love superheroes, violence, or action.<br /><br />BUY IT.  The extended edition is THE movie you want.

B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham continues to give us just plain old good stories!  If you like courtroom drama with a little Southern American history thrown in, this is the perfect read.  And even though you THINK you know which way this decision should go, you really don't know until the trial's end, and even then there is massaging of the verdict.  Just makes me want to go out and buy another Grisham novel!
B003EYVXTG|3.0|this movie is slow & wish through the movie they went back into the background or put some memories of her father it is missing that & something else to the story
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|When I went to purchase this book I seen quite a few negative reviews. But I loved the Shining and really wanted to know what happened to Danny. I'm sure a lot of us did. After finishing today I can say I loved this book just as much!<br />No it's not near as scary as The Shining, but it keeps you on the edge of your seat just the same. Some people are annoyed by some of the brand and product placement but I didn't find it noticeably annoying. It's Danny Torrance today so we're obviously going to read about some things that are or have have gone on recently.<br />Regardless of any reviews you come across this is a book you should read for yourself. And I strongly recommend reading The Shining first if you haven't already.

B009IQ0TGM|5.0|All around, this is a great album. I particularly enjoy listening to it in the winter... maybe I'm just weird like that, but certain albums have a feeling of specific seasons to them. The production to the whole album is fantastic, as, of course, is Ellie's voice. It's definitely not as &#34;pop&#34; and &#34;dance-friendly&#34; as some of her other work, and perhaps a bit mellower, but not in a bad way at all.
B00G1D8926|4.0|Although I was very familiar with the trial of Adolf Eichmann  and the phrase &#34;banality of evil&#34;, I was totally unaware of Hannah Arendt.  I looked for this film after listening to a New York Times book review podcast discussion of this film and Hannah Arendt.  Her book is still quite controversial and has only recently been published in Israel.  Watching this film will send you to Google, Wikipedia and YouTube for more information on all sides of the discussion.
B00G6MW68K|5.0|I own all of Muse's CDs and Concert DVDs and never get tired of their music or concerts. Live At Rome Olympic Stadium sounds and looks fantastic and is a great addition to their body of work. The sound quality is the best of any Muse DVD. The set and light show is a marvel all its own.<br /><br />The 2nd Law has not been my favorite Muse CD, but after viewing the concert I want to give some of the songs that I tended to pass up on the CD more play. Follow Me, Guiding Light, Explorers, and Panic Station were more commercial than I tend to like, but I enjoyed them very much as part of this concert. Supremacy, Knights of Cydonia (with it's haunting harmonica intro), Animals, Follow Me, Hysteria, Feeling Good, Madness, Time is Running Out, Supermassive Black Hole, and Uprising were my favorites in the Rome concert. Time is Running Out has to be one of the best concert songs of all time.<br /><br />I saw Muse perform live at Uncasville, CT this spring with the same pyramid set they used in the Extras songs; having a recording of this set is a particular treat for me. Stockholm Syndrome sounded edgy and raw compared with the Rome concert. The use of the pyramid with the haunting blue eye is visually captivating. Unsustainable opened the US Arena shows and the song and light show exemplifies Muse's creative range. We also get to see Chris sing lead on his song, Liquid State. The final Extra is a short film called The Road, set to the music of Animals, it is a look at the roadie pre- and post-production activities that goes into the concert experience. Don't miss any of the extras.<br /><br />The editing of the concert is less frantic than for the H.A.A.R.P. concert which gives the viewer a more relaxed experience which fits in better with the playlist and really highlights the artists' musical abilities on their instruments. As a Muse fan, it's great to see how they create some of the effects.<br /><br />ETA: I've watched the Blu-Ray of the concert now at least 12 times and I'm still not ready to put it on the shelf yet. I've just started listening to the companion CD and it is also awesome. Some of these songs such as Animals and Uprising are becoming new favorites over their studio versions.d I'm still not ready to put it on the shelf yet.

B001ECQ6E2|4.0|You can't beat the classic movies. Nor the classic stars Robert Taylor and Deborah Kerr.  It presents another forbidden love epic set in Nero's Rome with growing Christianity providing the seed for personal conflict and growth.  Another sword and sandal story (not quite on par with Ben Hur) but definitely worth owning.
1400052181|4.0|There is an irony, largely unacknowledged in this book, that the cells of a black woman advanced the cause of medicine that was historically far more readily available for white and male people.  Thus, the story of Henrietta Lacks could easily be seen as a parable for race relations (and to a lesser extent, female empowerment) in the United States over the last 75 years.  If this thought occurred to author Rebecca Skloot, she chose not to pursue it and instead presents us with a more straightforward and personal history of cellular medicine.  \\"Personal\\" is the key term here, as Skloot is very much a character in the story she presents.  As she traces the the spread and use of the HeLa cells, as they became known, she writes in parallel with her own personal journey to discover who Henrietta Lacks was.  As it turns out, this is as much a buddy story of Skloot and Deborah Lacks, daughter of Henrietta, as they work together to track down information.<br /><br />As is well-known to any researcher in cell biology, the HeLa cell line is a gold standard.  It is immortal, it is cancerous (cervical), but most importantly, it is easy to grow and keep alive.  This last point was not the case for any other cell line before HeLa, and this fact led to an explosion of research in cell biology, eventually leading to a cure for polio, several types of cancer, etc.  That is the good news.  The bad news is that Henrietta herself succumbed to the cancer at the age of 31 without ever knowing that her cells would revolutionize medicine.<br /><br />Notwithstanding the family tragedy, this book is really about the evolution of the practice of medicine, and how regulations and law are sometimes unable to cope with the speed of scientific advancement.  In an almost unbelievable breach of privacy, Henrietta's family members had their names and genetic information published in the journal Nature.  Similarly, much is made of the fact that tissue is still legally the ownership of the collectingdoctor, not the person who donated the tissue, and that \\"informed consent\\" is satisfied by a 1-liner at the bottom of most hospital permission forms that might read \\"I agree that xxx Hospital may dispose of any tissue they gather in any way they see fit\\".  It is hardly clear from this kind of statement that the hospital might end up commercializing for profit cells from that discarded tissue.  Thus, it is an important book if it helps shed light on a legislative and legal issue that most are unaware of.  Unfortunately, this book was written before the Supreme Court struck down the BRCA gene patent.  The legal ramifications of this decision (as I write this review only 6 months old!) have not yet played out, and may start to swing the pendulum back towards patient rights.<br /><br />So scientifically, ethically, and historically, this is an interesting and even an important book.  What this analysis does not express is the readability of the book.  Some might object at the personal style of the author, but really what could be more personal than someone's biological material?  So it is the right way to tell the story and the method does not diminish from its import.  Further, it is very accessible and entertaining.  One quibble I do have is the lack of an index, which this book should have because if the amount of original research included.  For my money, it doesn't quite reach the gold standard of \\"Emperor of all Maladies\\" - another scientific/historical book written in a personal voice - but it comes pretty close.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|Enjoyable and engaging story. Basically plausible, with some clever plot devices. If you like Sci-Fi, give it a read. Word required.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|This book was so suspenseful.  Didn't ever want to put it down and now I read that they are making a movie based on this book.  Great read, try it out

B0095G5AFU|3.0|If this app looks familiar, it is because it's a variation of Diary Pro, which was the FAOTD about a week ago.  My issues are the same with this app as with the prior app.  This one lets you create multiple notebooks as opposed to a single diary.  But the same problems as in the earlier app still exist.<br /><br />You can create a password, but in creating it, the password is hidden, so if you're not watching as you actually type, you can't tell if you mis-entered, and there is not a confirmation field where you enter it again.  So, once you set it, test it right away before actually entering any data, because, as the app warns you, you cannot recover your password.<br /><br />To test it, or if you use this app, to make sure your info is private, make sure you go back to the main page of the app before exiting; if you are on a page of a notebook and exit, you are able to go back to that page without entering a password.  So, so much for the password.  I've left the app, gone into other apps, and then gone back and right into the page I was working on.<br /><br />You can backup to Dropbox.  The export is only usable to import back to Notebook Pro.  You can also convert a notebook or a page within a notebook to PDF.<br /><br />There isn't much in the way of instruction, though there is a help page on the main menu.  Touching the icons reveals what they do pretty quickly.<br /><br />You can add drawings and photographs to entries; however they do not show within the page but as attachments.  You can have different fonts in different notebooks, but not within the notebook itself.  You can search entries.  <br /><br />Settings consist of a limited number of color themes, backup and restore settings and fonts.  It is very easy to use, and if all you need is a very basic diary and hinky ability to password isn't a problem, this isn't bad.  I've tested worse journals.<br /><br />I prefer DIario, which may be found here: [[ASIN:B00CGYBLGA B00CGYBLGA]]
B00GQ7OZR0|2.0|I pretty much agree with what others have said, the series has its moments but is bogged down by Deb hitting bottom in the first part and then Dexter turning into a wuss by the ending. I didn't mind all the emotional turmoil (in place of action) in some of the intermediate episodes because I get that the writers had quite a lot of work to do in order to take Dexter from 'Dexter' to 'Pathetic Wuss.' But in the end, they seem to run out of time and have their characters do unmotivated, unrealistic, or otherwise unbelievable things. As an example, I just don't see Deb being quite as incompetent as portrayed: we caught this really bad serial killer, I know, let's leave him all by himself for a while and see what happens! Right. And Dexter's actions at the end are just stupid. I don't buy the final &#34;boat trip&#34; because Dexter didn't even believe in funerals and there's no way he would take those chances to accomplish something relatively meaningless (to him). The writerd can say &#34;oh, but we made him change&#34; in this series but after a while, one just has to wonder &#34;why.&#34; If you take Dexter and turn him into &#34;non-Dexter,&#34; who the heck cares what happens to him. I watched the series to see the adventures of Dexter, not Wusster.
B0081SRJSY|3.0|The  tutorial on is a mess, it's like watching a game of Three Card Monte while suffering from a concussion. Things just happen, and you keep hitting 'next'. No REAL explanation of scoring or why you put your little colored people where, but eventually this will make sense. By all appearances, they did a good job, but if you have to be familiar with the board game for it to make sense, it's good that I got it for free.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is seriously one of the best board games I have ever played.  It is one of the few that is both truly easy to teach a group and great to play in one.  There is a considerable amount of luck involved, so even good players may find themselves in tough situations based on random rolls of the dice or luck of the draw.  That may put some off, but for me it keeps the game very interesting as you can lose even to &#34;novice&#34; players.<br /><br />The gameboard is unique in that it changes from game to game.  No game of Settlers is ever exactly the same due to this randomization.  Each time you play it, it's like a whole new world to settle.  My family has played this dozens of times, and it was easy for my kids to pick up even at 8 years old.  Still our household favorite.<br /><br />If you've never tried Settlers, buy this with confidence.  If you like board games and playing with people, you will love this game!
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|Great little light. Using it for a 92 year old relative who sometimes forgets to turn on the lamps in his room.
1594202273|5.0|Excellent and compelling read.  Anyone with an interest in this subject will enjoy this book.  The narrative is a little choppy as he mixes historical chapters with an in-depth description of a specific event, which if you don't read it all at once you can lose your thread a bit, but it did not take away from my enjoyment.

This album takes the best nuances of the three artists (minus the drum machine) and makes a reasonably decent album.

Give it a listen, It is a good solid effort,

B00E3VTR1K|5.0|Author Luca Rossi’s imagination knows no bounds. He travels through multidimensional inner and outer space in an amazing collection of edgy, entertaining, and erotic fantasies… highly-polished, well written short stories that don’t allow the reader an intermission between each tale. Yes, they are that good. He keeps you turning those pages. Get this one even if you are not into sci-fi, cyberpunk, fantasy or the paranormal. His writing is totally unique. Highly recommended.

B001O1O71C|5.0|This book was excellent to read, especially as a focus for a WWII topic in schools. My class has thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, and have gained a lot of knowledge and awareness of the events which happened throughout this time.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I was a little reluctant to read this book because of the reviews. I do agree a bit with it being a little hard to follow with it going back and forth between Tris and Four's perspectives, but it didn't keep me from enjoying it. I was  horrified by the ending at  first but love the way Veronica spins real life lessons into this story and I have to admit that I sometimes get bored of the predictable endings of most books. It can be a bit disturbing and stick with you for days, but an unpredictable ending is more interesting. And let's face it, life is unpredictable and doesn't always have a happy ending.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This is one of the absolute best shows on TV to date.  This is not a show about Zombies (there more of a back drop to the action that happens between the living), but a show about the human interaction and everything that goes along with it.  This show hits all of the right emotions and makes you love and hate the characters so much, you feel a part of them.  No one is safe though so be prepared for people to die, but that's what makes this so suspenseful.
B00ELOOYZI|5.0|What a great little educational game.  Simple engineering, design, testing, celestial mechanics... it's really cool.  Loses a little replayability after you make it to the moon, but that's a quibble.

B00AEUU4LQ|4.0|An engulfing tale of diaspora, mingling of cultures, of the vagaries of memory loss fat the two extremes of age, and of the humanity that ties us together. Hosseini is a writer for the new age where cultures are melding, people are falling in love and having children with race and religion unimportant.  While that always happened before (as most DNA profiles will show),  what has never before been true I think their families often support the union.  at least i Hope this is so and it is true in some parts of the globe.  I've never before read a book that took you inside the mind of the son of a drug lord and made his thoughts and choices if not noble at least comprehensible. I kept feeling a great hope for our species as I read this book.

B00FHDA6KE|5.0|I love this album!  I have not been able to stop listening since the CD arrived.  I take it from the car to my office, then back to my car.  There are people who have raw, pure talent, this kid is one.  I love his voice and the lyrics are haunting/inspiring/awesome.  I think #11 (Certain Things) might be our wedding song.  Well worth every penny.  James is sure to be a huge star one day.  At least, I hope so, because there are others out there without a lick of talent making lots of money for no reason (I'm looking at you, Justin Bieber).  I'm already looking forward to his second album.
B002VPE1WK|2.0|Love the bag but the handle broke off in less than a month. Shoulder straps are a little narrow for broad shoulders but the pockets and internal arrangements are great
B008220B0C|4.0|This movie surprised me. The documentary was deep and powerful and clearly a snapshot of an actual year in her life, not just a specific message. I loved getting to see more about her background and felt like we got to know her more as a person through this movie. I liked her music before, but I like it even more now!
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I love it. I find it super addictive. This game is my ultimate favourite . Can't get enough, sometimes I lose hours playing this awesome game
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book to so awesome!!!!!!! It has so much suspence and the twist ending is extremely surprising<br />I recombined this book to... Well ... Really, anybody who has the ability to read
B0060D2QR6|4.0|The Last Song,<br />A very cute movie that is great for the whole family!! Nothing too provocative, racy or risque but still plenty going on to keep you interested. Partly funny with some music thrown in and a dash of sadness at the end, while still being a good ending, So all in all a good movie.
0824835921|1.0|uhhhh.... I only did the &#34;look inside&#34; of this book, what is the point of a kanji book that doesnt give you the Japanese kunyomi and onyomi?! the most difficult part about kanji is the multiple readings and knowing how to read the kanji stand alone or in a compound. knowing just the English meaning doesn't do JACK for actually being able to read them the second a kanji is part of a compound which is MOST occurrences and ALL names of places/people. in which case this wouldnt even help you for traveling bc without the readings you cannot read the signs of literally anything. how does this book have good ratings!? are you people just learning stand alone kanji to get tattoos with????
B001Q9J4PG|3.0|I've read a lot of Tom Clancy 's books in the past and this one doesn't quite measure up to what I expected from the author. The story is hard to follow and it doesn't hold my attention very well. I have a hard time reading the book and following the main plot.
B00EL6ACOI|5.0|Outstanding documentary.... Of course its one sided!! SeaWorld was asked repeatedly to speak but declined... Why? No one can argue the logic and facts presented in this documentary... Glad SeaWorld told critics how &#34;inaccurate&#34; it was causing more notice to the film then it would probably get...

B0081ISUOG|5.0|Anything in this small application I can manage on the way I like. It is really very small, no adds no analytics. Of course, there are bundled stopwoch and timer in my phone, but this one can vibrate without noise at the time I select and I do not have to unnecessary disturb anybody and they do not have to know what and when I am doing.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|I am impressed with the tab casting abilitiy. Setup is easy if your workstation is on the same wireless network (Otherwise just use your phone to configure the device).<br /><br />Once I can get Chrome to play local media in a tab properly and I can cast it then I'd go 5 stars.<br />Youtube and Netflix work flawlessly out of the box.
B0095G5AFU|1.0|There are AdMob and AdSense in this application. That and access to the list of accounts is a little bit too much for the paid version. Sorry.
B004SMDJ9U|5.0|I love this show and all its characters! My daughter and son-in-law, my husband and I watch this show very closely. I was amazed to see John Dunsworth (Mr. Lahey from &#34;Trailer Park Boys&#34;) is in here and does a remarkably great job as &#34;Dave.&#34;  I can hardly wait to see if his daughter, Sarah Dunsworth (Sarah in &#34;TPB,&#34;) will also appear sometime.<br />Set on the coast of Maine, the town of Haven is a place where the &#34;troubled&#34; go (or are sent) because trouble is Haven's last name.<br />Stephen King is involved in the writing, and the story in the beginning is based on King's story &#34;The Colorado Kid.&#34; Watch for homage to him, and a number of other things.

B00FRQ32N4|5.0|This game is awesome and free! The game is just like the movie. The best part is you get to upgrade your robot! You get to choose over many different bots! If you liked the movie real steel you will love the game!
B004GHNIRK|5.0|It was free on kindle, I have not had chance to review it but after Christmas I will have more time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love this game! It's probably one of the coolest games on my kindle, me and my whole family are major despicable me fans, we can't get enough of the movies and this game is just as adding! I've had it for about 3 months and so far I've found nothing wrong with it. The graphics are great, the game is fast paced, the locations that you run in are designed great and the minions are sooooooo cute and funny. Another thing is that it's fairly easy to unlock and earn stuff, unlike other free games, where you have to spend a whole lot of money to get all the cool stuff you, can earn coins and bananas easly. Granted some of the costumes cost a lot of coins but I don't want them so bad that it ruins the game for me and it has NEVER once glitched or frozen up on me. All and all its an awesome game I would recommend it to anyone who loves despicable me and good games. :)
B00006HBUA|5.0|We have this in VHS, time to upgrade to DVD.  Was used, had a few scratches  but still worked.  I usually look for &#34;very good&#34;, I would consider this &#34;good&#34;
B007SYWFRM|3.0|The game is great. Cute, fun and addictive. Love chasing Scrat, but don't like having to acquire so many items with only (expensive, real money!!!) acorns for a payment option. Corporate greed strikes again!  Potential cost for the full game experience is in the four digit range vs. the purchase of  a complete game in the two digit range. Is it worth the expense? In my opinion....H&amp;@@ NO!!!!
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The movie came within days of my order in the shape described by the vendor.  It really is entertaining, but it also has an underlying message about the times.

B00BXDOSXS|5.0|had issues playing some videos until I downloaded HD video player. love it. plays all the videos I could not play before.  Best yet.
0312611692|5.0|This was most of the profound books I have read over the past 10 years. I was strolling through a book store in Scottland during a business trip and couldn't resist picking it up … through the page count did intimidate me. It read like suspense novel, except that it is nonfiction! I have never read a historian/ anthropologist who has been able to span as deep a history (5,000 years) with as much entertaining detail. And the ultimate conclusion will completely shake your foundation. At least it did for me.
0307352153|5.0|Incredibly amazing.  Since my college years I have become so obsessed in faking that I am an extrovert.  I became so accustomed to shaming my inward thinking and my super sensitivity preferring to try to painfully pretend and wish I was more extroverted. The world around us has us believe that there is something actually wrong with us and that we should follow the way of the extrovert.  THERE IS NOTHING FROM THE TRUTH.<br /><br />In all, this book not just tells you, but proves to you, that it is perfectly ok to be the introvert.  And that in fact, it is an incredible gift that is WAY undervalued in the western world.<br /><br />This book has started a revolution.
1250038820|5.0|I love the HONY facebook page and read it daily.  I bought this to support Brandon whom I have never met but feel like I know anyway.  This is a beautiful book,  giving images of daily street life in New York City.  I live in New York and love it,  but even people who don't live in NY could love it,  it's a terrific book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Okay. I held out getting this when I saw everyone playing.......now I just as addicted as they are!  Great game.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Everyone loves this game.  My wife, and my 4 year old.  It is simple, but fun.  She likes collecting all the stuff.  Wish the coins would refresh faster though.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|It is very challenging , and at times frustrating . I've missed a lot of shows I wanted to watch , but to busy playing CANDY CRUSH !!!!! I've got to bed late many nights also , why I think one more time , I'll get it !!!!! I have family member's in the 400 level , I don't see myself reaching those levels with out throwing my tablet out the window . LOL ( just kidding)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love this freaking game so much.  I play it all the freaking time! You should play too. Yeah yeah!!
B00BAXFECK|1.0|I didn't enjoy this book at all and certainly can't recommend it to anyone expecting any literary depth. The characters are implausible, the story line is thin, and the author's ramblings are banal.  Definitely skip.
B00DHKKN6Q|3.0|It is a nice time waster while you are waiting for an appointment.  It does not to give you the colors you need and sometimes you get the same color for 6 straight balls.

B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I've been reading king since the fifth grade and I'm over forty now.  Steve has helped to set the rhythms and phrasing that I appreciate most.  In truth, the internal voice I hear in my head is Stephen King.  Reading his works is nostalgic for me even if the story is new simply because of the rhythms and verbage.  When the story combines excellent quality and a link to a favorite oldy but goody like The Shining, well it doesn't get any better that.  Thank you Steve for all the entertainment as well as \\"furnishing\\" my mental attic.<br />Sarah V
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Amazing! I got lost in this series for the past three days sitting by a fire. It was a perfect book!
0736092269|5.0|I love the detail in the illustrations. THIS IS EASY TO UNDERSTAND. Good for all those who like to balance muscle growth in the physique.
B001EN71CW|5.0|Firefly is one of the best TV series of the past 20 years, if only for how well it gelled as a product within what is normally considered half of a North American TV season and the chemistry between the cast members! This show was the initial proof that Nathan Fillion could be a charismatic leading that ABC has bet on for the last 6 years with the hit dramedy &#34;Castle,&#34; along with being a major stepping stone for getting its various leads more face time to show off their acting talents.<br /><br />If you like Westerns? Watch it? Love space operas? Gotta watch it! If pondering the meanings identity, heroism, family, freedom and the nature of authority is your thing? This series is made for you!
B00EMGUST6|5.0|As a Motorhead fan this album is in my top 5. It's comforting to hear that Lem and the boys haven't lost anything as they get older.
B001DSNELA|5.0|For me, &#34;Casino Royale&#34; both respects and improves upon the original Fleming story in a fashion where James Bond becomes a hero for the 21st century without losing the elements that made men want to be him and woman simply want him for more than 50 years!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|John Grisham is an American treasure.  This book picks up the story in A Time to Kill.  I picture Matthew McConnaughey as Jake Briggance, but he's awesome too, so it was ok!  Both are such great, thought-provoking stories!  You just can't go wrong with a Grisham book - thank you SO much for a terrific read.
B003O86FMW|5.0|A must read before seeing the movie! Can't wait to read the next one before the third movie comes out!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wow! One of the best books I've ever read! This is raw honesty at its finest through the voices of teenagers.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It wasn't as good as the first two, but still readable. I think the first two had more action and a stronger story
B00GQ051NY|2.0|Dexter season 8 did not fulfill my high hopes that the show would go back to its golden standard, after a weak 7th season. In facts it even deteriorated from the previous year. The once typical traits of gripping suspense and calibrated script have vanished: everything seems sloppy and superficial, and the dialogues are embarrassingly void of substance. Overall I really enjoyed the show, but unfortunately I think the later part was wasted away; the last two seasons seem rushed and disconnected from the rest.
B005LAIIN0|4.0|The extended version on the Blue Ray is definitely the best version. I can only imagine the only reason why they left it out of the theatrical release was to keep it in the PG-13 rating because the extended scenes are more violent and bloody.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Had me with the first chapter and I had to keep going until I finished.  Grisham at his finest, pure and simple.  Make a movie, please!
B008XG1X18|5.0|I think this is a great app and has a effective way of storing your favorite pictures and sharing your ideas.  Works great on kindle fire and Pinterest is now becoming more available and popular.
B00GIXWHZ4|3.0|If you're looking for a decent action movie, this ain't bad.  Taken on its own merits, I enjoyed it.  If you're a fan of Wolverine from the comics, you'll be disappointed. Imagine a Wolverine who can't speak Japanese.  That's the character in this movie.  They destroy his backstory of living/training in Japan.  He's a total noob in Japan.  Wolverine.  Noob.  In Japan.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|Every time I left the game I had to restart in the current room. It wood be nice if it saved your place.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This is my favorite of the three books. My 14 year old son loved the books and my daughter 12 (now 13) year old has read this at least three times. She is not a big reader either so I love that she really got into these books. Catching Fire is also her favorite.
B008CRC506|5.0|I really loved this show and had to have it.  I will have get a new set before too long.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Love this case it doesn't add extra bulk to the kindle keeps it safe and stands up fine. Just what I was looking for.
B00F8H0LM2|5.0|Kids love it and that's all the matters lol JK the wife got this one for herself and she loves it. Works perfect, but the kids do love it also
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I love that he continued with some of the characters from &#34;The Shining,&#34; but then added a whole new twist and gave this book its own new story.  Loved it!!
0307269981|5.0|Couldn't put it down, loved the unusual characters and Nordic culture and setting.<br /><br />I did actually find the first half of \\"Dragon tattoo\\" to be a little slow to get started, but ultimately I appreciated all the set-up work that was done there so this second book dives right in. Very exciting and action packed. Some of the best parts of this book are left out in the movie. This is probably the best book in the trilogy but the third one is great too.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Wow, now I can play on my Kindle and IPhone!  It helps pass the time during chemo treatments and that is a good thing!
B004JZBGWI|3.0|Just doesn't do what I need.  Just need a simple &amp;#34;Desktop (like on Win 7/8, Ubantu, etc.) single or multiple note displayer.&amp;#34;. That is:  several notes in a single vertical window, or several notes displaced around the &amp;#34;desktop.&amp;#34;  Simple for Win 7/8 Linux desktops.<br /><br />Back to the Cloud with this one....<br /><br />...
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Love this trilogy, love the story the adventure, struggles, politics, romance. It has a little of everything I have the books in hard cover, on my old kindle and again on my new kindle. Words can't convert how great this trilogy is.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|The Ocean at the End of the Lane is the first Neil Gaiman novel I have read so far. Although unfamiliar with his work, I have indeed heard a lot of praises regarding his other novels. I was very curious and excited about his style of story telling and the fantasy world he built for us fellow readers. And after finishing the book, I would totally say that I for one will be following closely with Neil Gaiman's future publishing activities.<br /><br />The majority of the book is written in terms of a seven-year-old boy's perspective which Gaiman admitted later on that it was roughly based on himself at the age. The story unfolds as the narrator recalls his childhood friend, Lettie Hempstocks, a somewhat mysterious girl who seem to know things that are far beyond the boundary of ordinary reality. Their adventures began as an abrupt suicide disturbed the balance of their neighborhood. From there, the narrator's normal life quickly turned into a terrifying nightmare mixed with mythical creatures that was once shielded from the world.<br /><br />I really enjoyed reading this book. It's fairly short and easy to read. Gaiman's writing allowed me to have lots of vivid imaginations. I can almost see the pond at the end of the lane and the Hempstock farm that guards the bounds of reality and fantasy. I loved the ending as well! I was overwhelmed with feelings as I read through the last chapter when the story gets back to the current day. There are so much more I want to know about the narrator and Lettie, but I do think it ended at a great moment.<br /><br />If you haven't read this book yet, make sure to check it out. I can promise you will fall in love with it :)
B00DGN51O8|2.0|I watched this video by mistake. I think it is<br />only meant for children and/or immature<br />audiences. The special effects are O.K.,<br />but aside from that it is a waste of time.
B009NG1Q96|4.0|The Elite is the sequel to the #1 New York Times Best Seller novel The Selection by Kiera Cass. The series is set in a dystopian world and focuses mainly around the romantic relationships of the protagonist, America Singer, and the overall selection competition where the future queen of the country is chosen.<br /><br />The Elite starts off shortly after the end of the first book where the selection pool has been eliminated down to only six girls. Although America is still struggling to pick between Prince Maxon and Aspen, she has grown closer and closer to Maxon day by day. When she is finally ready to admit her true feelings, tragedies and sufferings of those she holds dear make being the future queen an almost impossible task. Her stance is shaken once again. While she is questioning her relationship with Maxon, the frequent and violent rebel attacks have become stronger than ever. Time is quickly running out as America tries to decide what kind of future she wants.<br /><br />First of all, I want to point out that I'm extremely in love with the covers of this series. I'm very picky when it comes to book covers and I have to admit that these two have really outdone themselves! Move on to the actual story, I enjoyed reading The Elite for the most part. I was a little annoyed by America in the beginning of the book when she keeps flipping back and forth between Maxon and Aspen with nothing else happening. It gets better later on as the plot picks up and other conflicts and issues are uncovered in America's relationship with Maxon. In addition, I really liked the world-building bits and pieces regarding Illea's history and how the castes were created. I wish Cass has spent more time developing this part and the rebel attacks. Overall, I'm happy with the character development in this sequel and I'm excited to see the series conclude in the last book The One.
B00BAXFJ5M|4.0|I've enjoyed this book series and really enjoy the author. This novel has great story, but the long term items come up short. King and Maxwell's personal relationship is no longer convincing and numerous references to previous books in the series are tiring, because, far too much time has passed between them for this reader to remember the details anyway.<br /><br />This story drug out as well. I love detail and backstory, but sometimes it's just better to get to the booming point.<br /><br />A fun read with memorable action moments. Too much dependency on the super hero hacker to connect all the doors for my taste, but then I read too much and have grown tired of the superhero who knows all. Give me the flawed hero(ine) who gets the job done but has a few screw ups along the way.<br /><br />I'll still read the next King and Maxwell novel.<br /><br />:-)
1593272774|4.0|I know my Grandson will enjoy it for Christmas. Really worth the imagination it can create for the builder of any age.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I wanted the heroine to transform into what the first two books began.  I am verrrryyyyyy melancholy concerning the ending.  It is a psychological ride that ends in crashing into a wall.  I wonder how the third movie will edit this: true to book or Americanize it with positivity and candycoat  the hardships and trials and tragedies...
B0055QYKQO|5.0|Has worked very well for me. even had some things i didnt expect, like dolby suround app for audio &#34;loved the music setting' and its own in windows overclocking easytune. i have everything overclocked with zero heat issues in my azza solano case.<br /><br />Note; if your running ATI graphics cards install all of your mobos crap but the amd catylist first then get the newest version for your card from amds site. then you can switch betwen your mobos dolby wich sounds way better for the optical sense you have that app, while still having your tvs hdmi audio as a option.
B00FR0GT9Y|2.0|So what I say that hasn't been said already, well I'll try anyways. What really ruined this album is the same that ruined it for everyone else. The cheesy drum machine, cmon' Sholtz, if you can get a live drummer to play in the bands live concerts, than why can't you use that same drummer to record in the studio? If there would have been a real drummer I might have considered giving this close to 4 stars. Also he claims he used the original analog equipment to make it sound like classic Boston. Really !???? It sure does not sound like it. And yes I listened to all the songs all the way through 7 times today, and I have been opened minded all these years to even enjoy the albums past the first two.<br /><br />Okay let's start with the first song. Heaven On Earth, the single, yes this is the best song on the album in my opinon, I was suprised because David Victor's vocals were really good, and reminded me if you took Brad Delp and Fran Cosmo's vocals and put them together, so I think this song is great in spite of what others think.<br /><br /> And of course the fact that the Late Brad Delp is included in this album, however three of these tracks , Didn't Mean To Fall In Love, Someone 2.0 and Te Quiero Mia ( Best Buy bonus track release original version titled &#34;I had A Really Good Time&#34;  ) were songs that we already heard on Corporate America, so why did they need to be on here or remixed, they were better off being left alone, but yes there was a new one with Delp called Sail Away, and is a good tune as well , but it sounds like it was unfinished and short.<br /><br />Now let's get a little harsh.<br />Start with intrumental &#34; Last Day Of School&#34; , okay first of all classic rock artist out there, giving songs titles that have to do with School isn't so cool like it used to be during the Alice Cooper School's Out days ( Another cheesy title was called &#34; School's Out..Surf's Up&#34; from Queen + Paul Rodgers ) , and besides, most of us Boston fans are in our late 30's up to our early 50's now, and we have been out of school for years , so there is nothing to rebel against school anymore.<br /><br />Then you have Brad Delp's vocal twin Tommy DeCarlo, who got assigned to sing the most redicilous songs on the album, all which don't grab you at all, yes Brad Delp is gone and we accept that fact sadly, and Tommy singing classic Boston songs like Brad live is fantastic, but for this album he really got the crap of the crop on the songs.<br /><br />Then there is Love Got Away with Tom Sholtz on vocals, sorry Tom, stick to guitar playing and production<br /><br />And last Kimberley Dahame who is a great singer and a talented musician, however I do agree with the others when it comes to the comment of her voice not fitting in with the Boston sound, in spite of the fact that this version of You Gave Up On Love ( another Corporate America rerun ) is actually better that the original version, mainly replacing the original male singer with Tommy DeCarlo sounds much better, ( would have been even better if it was Delp on co vocals to begin with ).<br /><br />So there you have it, if it took Sholtz over ten years to make this album an this is the best he can come with, I hate to see what it would have sounded like if it took him 5 years or less.<br /><br />Sorry Shotlz, you really need to listen to your fans better especially on the drum machine deal because that has got to go, plus you claim that there are unfinished and unreleased stuff with Brad Delp, then maybe you need to finish and release that instead of redone versions of Corporate America songs, I might even suggsest swallowing your pride and contacting Barry Goodreau to help you out with the next Boston album you plan to release next decade sometime, hell even get Sib ,and Fran Cosmo back as well, then maybe try again with David Victor and Tommy DeCarlo in the mix. Well I guess we'll have to wait and see.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Great book for young adults and adults as well.  Loved the history and photography. Worth the cost and looking forward to the sequel.
B005LAIGOQ|5.0|This movie was very good!  Not a whole bunch of blood like most of the other horror movies.  It was more thrilling and suspenseful.
B00FAPU0UK|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was a surprising, exciting, and naughty adventure. Authors Parkerson and Puckett are a tremendous team. I laughed out loud at several points and could not guess what was coming next.
B0042MEQVG|5.0|I have all four of the episodes and have enjoyed watching them.  Breaking Dawn wasn't as good as I thought it would be, but I still enjoyed watching it.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Angry Birds gets all the attention for being super simple and super addictive but this is my go-to timewaster. You won't regret spending a buck or two on it. I promise. (The spin-offs are all great too.)
B002V092M4|5.0|As always John le Carre does not let the reader down with this book. I found I could not put it down. An enjoyable read.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|SwiftKey is the best keyboard you'll ever buy. It's great on tablets but it's fan-friggin-tastic on phones. The swipe-typing is the best I've ever used and the predictive text is scary accurate even with all the weird non-words I use. (It even got 'fan-friggin-tastic'!)
B0094KF4WG|5.0|A good first hand account of what occurred in the killing of Osma Bin Laden. At least written by someone who was there and had first hand knowledge of what happened.
B004SKHJF2|4.0|I know I'm not using all of the features but as a remeber-this-song-so-I-can-listen-to-it-later-on-Google-Play app it's awesome. I'd five star it if there was a &#34;listen on Google Play&#34; button in lieu of Spotify.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Super fun and great graphics. The controls are very responsive. This has got to be the best game I have played on my phone. Motorola Razor.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|A must have! It fits my families entertaining likes and we are looking for the other seasons!  Simply the best show ever!
B009VA1FN6|5.0|I was completely sucked in by this novel!<br /><br />The Secret Keeper by Kate Morton was well written, giving out little snippets of information about characters at a time. At times I felt like my loyalty towards certain characters was really challenged (until a wonderful twist at the end made everything make sense)!
B00867HDTA|3.0|It was fun at first but gets terribly boring after 5 min. i glad i got it for free on amazon apps free app of the day.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|What an excellent story! I am not a fan of WWII or Nazi Germany stories, but loved this one very much. It made me laugh and it made me cry. I will recommend it to everyone.
B00DDXJRJG|2.0|The app works great but for some odd reason it crashes a lot when I play my music, i think it doesn't like my music player (power amp)
B00AB7HESI|4.0|I loved this game for ds and now it's for my kindle fire and it's just as good as ds<br /> I have to say you shouldn't have to pay for more levels.  you can eat lizard poop
B00E7SFAAG|5.0|The game was really great, there's many levels and place to go in the game. The object of the game is to get the 3 apples before the kid gets to it. the map starts you out in the fields to being able to skate in space. GREAT GAME!!!
B00992CF6W|3.0|it is a good game and I am very happy it is finally for kindle fire but it doesn't give you much to do.lizards are bullet proof
3833160454|3.0|This book is ok, not much on making shoes, but more on the history of making shoes. nice pics through.
0425252868|5.0|I like reading these kind of document stories.<br />I read the reviews and found this book at Amazon, great price great story.
B00992CF6W|1.0|It is awful you cant even change from creative mode to survival mode<br /> So that's my review........by peeps around the world
B00EJYGL8S|5.0|Excellent instrumental Christmas album! This recording was completely in line with my expectations of the Piano Guys. I loved &#34;Angels We Have Heard On High!&#34; As Jon has done with so many other familiar pieces, he wove in a melody of other familiar Christmas Carols. I get goosebumps when I listen to it. If those reading can excuse a bit of an emotional description here, there is a grandness--a majesty to the chording and the vocalization and yet it has some modern and creative elements as well. The beauty of the album was a gift I gave myself. If you like peaceful and calm instrumentals, you'll love the haunting melody of &#34;O Come O Come Emmanuel.&#34; It is just piano and cello. Worth every single penny I paid for it and it will be a great gift to give others.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Love the Minions! The only drawback is you can't go from area to area after you get  through them, so it gets repetitious.
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|Absolutely beautiful music. Creative interpretations of familiar Christmas songs. As usual, The Piano Guys did not disappoint! Love it and can't wait for the NEXT album to come out!
B000V39KDO|5.0|Absolutely love this movie. I have watched it several times and it never gets old. Would recommend this movie to other adults. Not suitable for children.
B008CLI4N4|2.0|After reading the books the HBO season 1 was extremely disappointing. The only characters that fit with the book were Ned Stark and Tyrion! Too many differences from the narrative. You don't realize what a great character Tyrion is. Glad I read the books...will not be purchasing season 2
0425266060|5.0|Great set, in perfect condition. The set got here well before the tracking information said it would be. Very pleased with the service on this purchase.
B00C2VIA52|3.0|Not a lot of meat to it. A vet of magic or any deep card game will find this simplistic but, fun (in a better than watching grass grow, sort of fun). Interesting enough to pass time while bored.
B0013N7AD8|4.0|It's Good Batman Movie. Batman, Batman Returns, Batman Forever, Batman & Robin all good.<br />but Batman & Robin is so not good i think.
B004EPZ034|5.0|Arrived perfectly, on time and in great condition. :) My 3 year old loves this movie and I'm excited to see him pull it out of his stocking.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|This is definitely the best game I have seen for the kindle fire. It took a few tries to download but the graphics and gameplay are definitely worth it. I recommend this game to all kindle users with a GB to spare. Plus, it's FREE!
B00FATEJYE|4.0|The beat fighting game app I think you will ever see on a mobile device, mortal kombat meets the dc universe, when I comes to play style, great game!
B00CLT31D6|3.0|TL;DR<br />The authors of the book interviewed a bunch of millionaires and were shocked to discover that their notion of millionaire didn't really match reality. They were everyday folks who sacrificed and saved money.<br /><br />I really didn't learn much from this book beyond the obvious &#34;you must save money.&#34; I'm giving it 3 stars because it has set in motion me taking a more active role in my financial future rather than just &#34;winging it.&#34;
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|Very addictive. I love bubble shooter games and this one is a favorite.<br />Endless fun for all ages. Play play play.
B00EQ30RVY|5.0|STP has always been one of my favorite bands.  A lot of people are going to refuse to buy this record because it's not Scott Weiland singing.  Like any family there are problems and some times you just have to walk away until that person can find their way back.  I will never fault the boys for wanting to continue on their musical journey of creativity.  Chester does a bang up job on vocals with these new tracks.  I am looking forward to seeing them live in concert and would never object to them creating more music in the future when time allows.  The DeLeo's musical talent is still showcased as it always was from the days of Core.<br /><br />Kudos!  Good job boys!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|This is a great book explaining who we are as woman in the workplace, why we are where we are, and how to get where we want to be.<br /><br />Some of the ideas I had heard before, however it was a good reminder.  The other parts of the book made me think outside myself and look at things from a different perspective.<br /><br />Enjoy!
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|I really liked this game.  the puzzles were hard, but not impossible.  it was a long game, which I thouroughly enjoyed.  thanx g5.
B00FANXZL8|5.0|Like many of you I was so disappointed with the Next day and just give the CD away to my brother. Being an audiophile, was so nervous and excited to find out Pop King Bowie was releasing a second album. A Ep of material left off 'Next Day'. and the man always re-invents himself, after the dud disc 1, Bowie is back with disc two. every song here is better than the first album. The second CD has to be the 'Best' pop/rock album of the year. Hands down. The king is back.
1594203334|5.0|No Dr Spock, more an insightful look at the ways different cultures bring up good kids. I'd recommend it, if for nothing more than a good comparison.
B00C3UUZVE|5.0|My relatives love this game. I have noticed that if you don't press the home button it freezes , and will force close the app.
B00BD6RFFS|5.0|Incredible, I loved this book from beginning to end. I purchased the kindle version and as such I missed out on a lot of the illustrations. However, for anyone interested in building or tailor organizations to effectively &#34;Get Sh*t done,&#34; this books is a great read.
B00594XOZU|5.0|It's now updated and working again I love it. It's better than last time. I like it because it's free and easy to use.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I'm always up for a challenge and this has it! Not too hard and not too easy. Keeps you on your toes.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|We love lego advent calendars.  They are pricey but worth every penny.  The kids love to put the little thing together each day.  Great twist on an Advent Calendar.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The kite runner and a thousand splendid suns were much better, this book gets boring sometimes and I scrolled a lot without reading
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|All I am saying is loved it ! Couldn't ask for a more thrilling and heart stopping end to the trilogy
B0015AARJI|5.0|Amazing controller, fast, nimble and with a great range. What can I say? This is superb. I just hoped the back buttons would be a little more firm.
B006C1DH92|4.0|I've played both versions of this game (the original version and this one), and, even though it may not be as good as the other one, it sure is an interesting variant of the game. It has some features that are not in the original version (the special challenges), but also lacks some key features of the original one (the timed, bombless mode, for example). Though, its still pretty fun; the special challenges out due any ones that you would find in the original version, and the Fairy Tale facts that are at the end of every round can be quite interesting and sometimes funny. Even though it may be a little \\"hard\\" for younger ones since there is no bombless mode, but the main theme of the game is very child-friendly. So, it has some advantages over the original version, but also has some disadvantages to the latter one. But still, it will complete your Fruit Ninja app collection.
B00EGMQIJ0|1.0|Here is a quick summary of the &#34;The Circle&#34;...Mae gets a job at The Circle, a one stop shop of online domination, and then blah blah blah blah, and then more blah blah blah.  She is clueless and not at all likable.  An idiot really.  She blindly believes everything she is told, giving up every shred of free thought and aspect of her privacy, without a single doubt or question.  I started skimming half way through in the hope that she might reveal even a glimpse of intelligence, but to no avail.  Flat characters and a horrible book.
B0015AARJI|5.0|I'm not a gamer, and I bought this controller in order to have two controllers at Thanksgiving for the nephews to play games head-to-head. The adults also had fun.<br /><br />The Sony controller is an ergonomic marvel, and everyone appreciated the tactile feedback that the rumbling shake mechanism offers. The bluetooth connection pairs with the PS3 seamlessly and immediately.<br /><br />Even casual gamers can benefit from having two controllers. It makes family gatherings more enjoyable.
B00FATEJYE|5.0|Apple had the app first and I got tired of asking to play my friends ipod just to play injustice
B002WJI658|5.0|Very well-made, bright and clean.  My son expects the plush things to be exactly the same as the video character.  Worth every penny since it pleased my very particular child!
B00D48BSBA|4.0|Forsyth style of story telling is spell binding. It has necessary dose of details which are informative and interesting. Plot as usual has straight forward flow. Good read all in all.
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I fell for this young man's music while watching him on American Idol.  Such a talented, deserving, and humble person.  This is one of the best albums I've heard in a long time.  I love every song, and they all speak to me.  I've heard Phillip Phillips called The New Boss, and I think he's worthy of the title.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Awesome game but I need to be more like the Xbox and pc add some wolves horses and put in the pattern for crafting
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I love this game it is absolutely amazing. I play it everyday. This is my favorite game ever!!!! I recommend it to everyone.
B00BAXFACO|1.0|Where is my book? I pre-ordered it in November and I am STILL waiting for it to download. I would like to read it so I could give it a rating it deserves.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Loved the style and creative delivery of this touching story. Poetic description of the ugliness and the beauty of the human race and the hate and the love they are capable of. Highly recommend.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Good game, just started playing, but so far it looks ok! Will review more about it later in the game, kelly x
B00BGI086Q|5.0|Best superhero show on television.  Good action and story.  Makes me miss smallville less:)  Action on this show cannot be beat.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|(TV's Hawkeye Pierce coaching Radar O'Reilly on the finer points of music: &#34;All you have to say is, 'Ahh! -- Bach!'&#34;)<br /><br />Ahh! -- Susan!
B00BEIYMAG|5.0|This movie is scary and did not disappoint.  I don't scare easy.  I'm too desensitized, but this one got to me.  Not only were the filmmakers accurate about the paranormal stuff, but they managed to be entertaining without selling out the way most Hollywood movies do in this sort of genre.  The film is interesting and with a great story while serving up the thrills on an entertainment level.  This movie is scary to begin with and even scarier with the lights out.  Play it on a surround sound system if possible.  Get ready to jump.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|THAT WAS A FANTASTIC BOOK???? I read ALL the other ones and now I can FINALLY READ THE THIRD WHEEL THEN THE NEWEST One!! :)
B00785P2QC|5.0|Nice free game, beautiful art, loving this! I really like watching the tiny vehicles run around on my roads! Hope there are trains... I love tiny trains...
B003P2WO5E|5.0|At first I did not know what to think about this book, but could not put it down. The more I read the more I got into it and completely loved the story. Very original setting and characters. I am very impressed with this and can not wait for book 2!
B003SNKBXW|5.0|Best novel you've never heard of. This book formed the basis of the Roman Polanski movie &#34;The Ninth Gate&#34;. Typical of other book-to-film adaptations, the book is so much richer. Set in modern-day Spain, it follows a rare book purveyor/mercenary who has been hired by two separate clients. One client wishes him to authenticate a &#34;missing&#34; chapter from The Three Musketeers by Alexandre Dumas entitled &#34;The Anjou Wine.&#34; His other client tasks him with authenticating a Medieval book which instructs the reader how to conjure the Devil. Unrelated, right? Or are they? The book is told using many references to classic literature, including (of course) &#34;The Three Musketeers&#34;, &#34;Moby Dick&#34;, and many others. The characters themselves become characters within these classics, following clues to unlocking the mysteries of the two manuscripts, and paralleling their fates. There is humor, intrigue, mystery, and all around fun in this book. I can't believe that it is not more popular. Pick it up for the weekend (because I guarantee you will not be able to put it down and it's a quick read).
B00009MGGI|5.0|Like a good book that you can't put down 'till you've read it all.. Relevant to politics today in many ways. An excellent trilogy.
B0036TGT3E|5.0|I love love love The Lion King. I'm a huge fan of animation and to have this in such breathtaking quality almost makes my eyes bleed. In a good way.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|Love reading college au fanfic? Then you should really give Fangirl a try.<br /><br />Let me tell you why I loved it in as non-spoilery a way as I can.<br /><br />So, fair warning, I have a heck of a lot of similarities going with our protagonist, Cath.<br /><br />She’s an identical twin whose sister is drifting away from her towards parties and new roommates, with a father who works in advertising and a need to update her epic-length fanfic about Simon Snow that sometimes supersedes her desire to participate in her English major classes.<br /><br />I’m a fraternal twin whose brother went to a different, party-based college. I now currently work in advertising after successfully graduating with an English degree despite my serious fanfiction addiction.<br /><br />Needless to say, I identified a little bit.<br /><br />However, every point of identification was more of a little ping of “hey I know what that’s like” instead of something I had to lean on to continue getting into the story. Cath’s struggles with her first year of college had a hell of a lot of differences with my life, and I still was sucked into some real empathy and personal investment during the story.<br /><br />Stuff I liked:<br /><br />The level of detail setting up the Simon Snow fandom<br /><br />Simon Snow is a book series in Cath’s world that is similar to Harry Potter - but NOT HARRY POTTER. There’s a fake wikipedia (Encyklowikia) page setting up the background for the series, and excerpts from the “canon” books at the end of some chapters. The characters actually mention HP in conversation, and the bits of book displayed show some similarity to the world of HP, but definitely isn’t a parody - there are no characters that are obviously Snape or Hermione or Ron or Harry with a different name. I love the system of magic in the series and just how good it is at hinting at a larger world of novels. I really loved how obvious it is that Cath is deep, DEEP into the fandom itself. Aside from stuff like all her clothes and decorations being related to SS, she’ll quote the book at times in her mental thoughts or spoken conversations, similar to how other people will do Kermit arms after watching The Muppets.<br /><br />The fanfiction’s evolution<br /><br />So, Cath writes Simon Snow fanfic (slash, of course). At the end of every chapter, there is either an excerpt from the canon books (with a copyright mark showing which book) or a passage from one of Cath’s fanfics (with a copyright showing date posted and whether she wrote it solo or with her twin). The amazing thing about how Rainbow Rowell treated this section is how the quality of fanfic changes depending on how long Cath has been writing. You can tell from the first sentence whether or not the skill is there from writing mass amounts of fanfic. Tropes, overly flowery language, too much tell without enough show, relationship issues, are all things that appear or fade away depending on the age of the fic. The stuff that Cath is currently working on actually reads better than the canon books (which again, very true to life of a lot of fanfic, HP in particular). Loved it. Also, loved that while Cath at times feels uncomfortable trying to explain her fandom or her feelings about fanfic, there’s no impression that fanfic itself is weird. Most books that feature mentions of fanfiction come across as pedantic, smarmy and condescending or just this kind of bemused “eeew” feeling. Not so here!<br /><br />Cath’s struggle to find her identity<br /><br />I know I’ve just written a novella about Simon Snow’s presence in the book, but really, completely setting aside all hints of fandom, this is still a great coming-of-age story (or bildungsroman, to use the one term I remember from AP English in high school). Cath has to deal with conflict both external and internal, and you can’t help but empathize with her.<br /><br />Peeks of tumblr and of serious freaking fandom<br /><br />The merch, the lingo, the fact that every time she starts worrying that she’s perpetuating misogynistic stereotypes I feel like I’ve totally read that post - pretty much the entire mental landscape of Cath is familiar territory to anyone who’s dived deep into fandom. Lots of famous landmarks for those who’ve visited before: mental conversations with characters, social anxiety, a deep mistrust of the patriarchy, the ability to see the entire world through slash goggles - it’s all there.<br /><br />The way mental illness and social anxiety is addressed<br /><br />And speaking of social anxiety, this book doesn’t shy away from mental and psychological issues, but doesn’t glamorize them, either. Cath does not get a “get out of homework, social ties and responsibility card” just because she has need of therapy. It’s not treated trivially, but at the same time, no one’s willing to start that codependent caretaker relationship with Cath, either (and seeing as how I’ve had roommates who started that whole dealio in college I was really freaking glad for that).<br /><br />Her freaking roommate, yo.<br /><br />All tertiary characters aren’t really tertiary. Cath’s roommate may be my favorite person I’ve ever met in fiction. Seriously. I won’t even tell you anymore than that - she’s just the person I kind of want to be without ever really wanting to be.<br /><br />In conclusion, read this book. You most likely won’t regret it. I’ve been writing this review for like a week and I read the whole book in a night. That’s how good it is.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|really well done app. a little slow sometimes. wish it had more horse breed options. but overall, its awesome. would recommend.
B00DBO1YMK|5.0|The piano guys only makes the very best music. This is music that you will never get tired of! Plus, their youtube movies are fantastic.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read Khaled Hosseini's other books and he has the rare gift of creating characters that come alive within the world that he creates.  Reading his book, I see the village, the tacky mansion, the city, the people and the world in which they live.  He brings to life Afghanistan, a place I have never been. He does not write stories that tie together in neat Hollywood endings, but he weaves the bittersweet reality of life into a poignant and meaningful tribute to people who live through even the most difficult times and still somehow  cling to their humanity.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|The product is good, but it is not so easy to sharpen knives as it is spoken in advertising. Let's see if I can use the best product.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|Beware purchasing anything in game.  If your device crashes the game devs will not honor any purchases or progress.  You start everything from the beginning.  Other than that it's an entertaining game.
1609611543|5.0|This is an amazing, eye opening book!  I have seen and felt the positive effects after taking the advice of the author, Dr William Davis.  My teenage son isn't thrilled, he's lost five pounds that he didn't want to loose!  I've lost nine in about three weeks!  It's a complete change from the typical American diet, many of us have grown up on.  I'm hoping to change the health of my entire family and get them accustomed to life without wheat so we can all feel and look better, stay out of the doctor's office and off of prescription drugs!  Thank you Dr. Davis!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|*****5 stars loved the books and both movies can't wait to see the last movie! Great author loved it!! Great!

B008AIGWVA|5.0|Our 7, going on 8, daughter all but begged me to download Talking Ben The Dog onto the Kindle Fire cuz Daddy has Ben on his phone and she thinks Ben is hilarious. Apparently Ben is the bees knees because she has the case of the giggles that only Ben can cure. Now she has greater visuals on a much larger screen, and more playtime with her furry four legged belching friend.
B0095G5AFU|5.0|I used the free version for years and great to see the pro version for free app of the day.
B004JMY312|5.0|Cute movie!  We ordered it to watch Halloween with my son.  I have never seen the entire movie and am glad we chose this one!  It's getting harder to find movies that we approve of for our children (without too much adult humor, language, etc).  We really enjoyed watching this one and will most likely add it to our Halloween selections in years to come!
0060254920|5.0|I bought this for my grandson for Christmas.  It was a favorite of my younger daughter, so I thought her son should enjoy the great stories for for years to come.

B007SGM084|5.0|from: Fifty Shades Trilogy Bundle: Fifty Shades of Grey; Fifty Shades Darker; Fifty Shades Freed (Vintage) (Kindle Edition)<br />I really enjoyed this trilogy. I'm glad I bought the trilogy, rather than just the first book, because the story gets better as it goes along. The author displays a real understanding of the effects of a lack of nurturing on the person a neglected child becomes.<br /><br />This is the story of Anastasia (Ana) a young woman just graduating from college at the time she meets billionaire Christian Grey and falls in love with him. The book is told in first person from the point of view of Ana. Christian tries to warn Ana away more than once, telling her he is 50 shades of 'messed up', which is true. But Ana cannot resist him and he cannot resist pursuing her, in spite of his conviction that he is no good for her. Although Christian eventually turns out to be a much better person than he gives himself credit for being, their road to happiness is a rocky one, not only due to Christian's hangups, but Ana's as well.<br /><br />I found Anna to be annoying. She uses the same irritating exclamations over and over. She castigates Christian for having mercurial mood swings, when hers are just as bad, if not worse. Ditto for jealousy, touchiness, and stubbornness. She is unbelievably immature and self-centered. But as the books goes along, she gradually matures and becomes more of a heroine we can admire.<br /><br />Christian is, of course, beautiful in the extreme, and his emotional flaws make him an endearing hero -- the kind you just want to wave a magic wand over and heal all his wounds, which are deep.<br /><br />I thought the Kindle price of this book was a real bargain, considering that it is three books, plus a short section at the end written from Christian's point of view. The writing style was good in spite of it being written in first person. There were a few errors, but not enough to mention. Overall, I would recommend this bundle.
B009H442DG|1.0|\\"Hey Oh-liv-eee-yah... lets make an ow-bum!\\" Yeah. Ok. This is the album that should never have been made. Where to start?<br /><br />First off, I blame Ms. John. She gave Travolta a pity bump and she shoulda known better. Her voice is, as usual, pretty good and sans autotune. I expected a pretty mellowed out nostalgic tour of Xmas standards and that's what I got from her. Travolta? Oh, man...<br /><br />The throes of advanced longevity are apparent here and I think he's the only person who doesn't know it. Listening to him trying to sing on this album is worse than watching baby seals get clubbed on Nat Geo HD. Seriously. The warbling and campy approach they used to mask his horrible voice is the kind of painful lounge performance that would make the hookers give up and leave the hotel lobby on a Friday night during a used car salesman convention. It's just bloody awful.<br /><br />This is the musical equal to the movie with the guy with the hat and whip and all the aliens and crystal skulls - when it was over I was wishing they would make another just so the franchise wouldn't end on such a horrible note. Pun intended. Someone should have walked into the studio, turned on the light and sprayed these two with a hose to stop the bad things from happening.<br /><br />Unless you simply CANNOT live without every single album Olivia Newton John has put out skip this one.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Tuff book to get into at first but is a deep story and very good read right till the end
B0013HA838|5.0|Amazing production: beautiful costumes and sets, and not even to mention the singing talent - beyond words!! Dorothea Röschmann is sublime and entertaining.
B00BAXFACO|5.0|I'm so glad that at least one of my favorite authors can still deliver a great story. He's the only one left that I'll pre-order any  mystery he pens.

B003G4W49C|5.0|Good detail and very entertaining and kept my attention as I read it.<br />Better than the amazing movie.<br />This book is awesome.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I loved the entire Stargate Series and watched all of them.  This is, like the rest, very entertaining, but an unfulfilling ending which left me wanting more.
0307595579|5.0|Big fan of the series and prefer hardbound books over paperbacks. Would like to see American movie version of the 2nd and 3rd<br />books
1250006341|4.0|I'm a huge Downton Abbey fan of course!  This book provided some fascinating insights to life in those times and interesting comments from people on the show.  A must-have for die-hard fans, though other people probably wouldn't find it as enjoyable.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|I only gave it 4 stars because the main  players went from smart to dumb to easily. Balsamic stile still strong. All in all, a good read.
B00AF6MF9I|3.0|Nice game but every time I closed out reopened none of the previous progress was saved makes it really frustrating to continue to play the game
B00ARAO720|4.0|Good movie. I saw it without any expectations and I was impressed with the movie and the acting. Pretty good.

B00G15MDI0|4.0|&#34;The Book Thief&#34; (2013 release; 132 min.) is the film adaptation of the beloved novel by Markus Zusak. As the movie opens, Death (in a voice over) cautions the audience &#34;one small fact: you are going to die&#34;, and with that we are filled with a pending doom and gloom about what is to happen. The stage is Nazi-Germany, February 1938, and we are introduced to Liesel, a young girl (9 or 10 yrs. old) who has just lost her younger brother to (unspecified) sickness as they are being transported to their new foster family. Liesel's foster mom Rosa is as tough a cookie as her foster dad Hans is as sweet a man you'll ever meet (he calls Liesel &#34;your majesty&#34; to make her feel welcome). Liesel befriends Rudi, a boy on her street, and soon they become best friends. Foster dad Hans teaches Liesel to read, which opens a new world for Liesel and she eagerly snaps up the opportunity to explore new books. Then Kristallnacht (&#34;night of the broker glass&#34;) takes place and Max, a Jewish young man whose dad once saved Hans' life, takes refuge in the home of Hans, Rosa and Liesel. At this point we are about 40 min. into the movie. Will Liesel ever see her real mom again? Will Max survive the years of hiding? What becomes of Liesel and Rudi? To tell you more would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br /><br />Couple of comments: first, this is a very careful/faithful adaptation of the novel, as directed by pretty much unknown UK director Brian Percival. If there is one complaint that I may have about the movie, it is that pretty much every scene feels very much staged (which of course they are), almost like we're watching a theatre production and not a movie. Second, the acting performances are top-notch, with Geoffrey Rush and Emily Watson as the loving foster parents, but the real revelation is the young Canadian actress Sophie N&eacute;lisse, in the role of Liesel. N&eacute;lisse had previously appeared in last year's excellent (and Oscar-nominated) Canadian film &#34;Monsieur Lazhar&#34;. In this movie she radiates such presence on the big screen that she almost blows everyone else away. Third, the movie features an excellent soundtrack, by none other than the legendary John Williams, in one of his rare non-Steven Spielberg movie efforts (I couldn't help but think that in fact &#34;The Book Thief&#34; feels like it could've been made by Spielberg). Last, be sure to bring a Kleenex tissue with you, as chances are that you will need it.<br /><br />I had seen the trailer of this a few times in recent weeks and was looking forward to seeing this. The movie opened this weekend at my local art-house theatre here in Cincinnati. When I went to see it last night (a weekday night), I was pleasantly surprised how well attended it was. If you loved the novel, you will certainly love this movie adaptation. Even if you didn't read the novel, and are in the mood for something that is not quite your standard Hollywood fare, I suggest you seek out &#34;The Book Thief&#34;, be it in the theatre or on DVD/Bly-ray. You won't be disappointed.r's excellent (and Oscar-nominated) Canadian film &#34;Monsieur Lazhar&#34;.

B00F87ZUYG|3.0|The episodes with the sickness were not very entertaining at all. I think they were supposed to add some drama and possibly feel stronger emotional connections with certain characters, but they were not very successful in my opinion. I was sick of the sickness also because of just how much time they spent on certain scenes. At specific scenes in the sick cell block I just thought, &#34;Why am I watching this?&#34;, which is a question i don't ever really think about while watching the series. What redeemed this season was the last couple of episodes. They gave me hope and piqued my curiosity as to what kinds of decisions a particular character would make. The mid-season finale was great and in my opinion the best episode of the season so far.

0060989157|5.0|If you are looking for a laugh and some crazy stories from an 80s hair band then definitely read this book.<br /><br />If you aren't a fan of poop and sex type humor you may not want to read this book. You can tell the style of this book by reading the first few pages. If you laugh it's a win and it will only get better! If you are grossed out then this is not the book for you.
