1582701709|5.0|Thought provoking reading.  It is like anything else take what works for you and let the rest go.  I started learing \\"The Secret\\" in 2004 before I realized what I was learning.  A natural pessimist and very negative individual I find that it has helped me turn my life around for the better.  I have a new me and with it a new life.  I am a believer!
0439813786|5.0|<br />Absolutely enthralling and delightful for <br />kids and grownups. A rare book to treasure <br />and love.
0786860707|5.0|This book is amazing. What I have read so far contains history of Animation at Disney, and it is such a treat to read! Being an aspiring animator, this book is just awesome. If you expect to learn animation, this isn't the book, but if you want to learn Disney animation history and about the greats and the amazing old movies, this book is it.
1582701709|5.0|This is a very powerful book! Want to change your life? I recommend this book to anyone and everyone who doesn't know about law of attraction! Not a reader? Get the DVD and watch with your children!!!
1560100842|4.0|I was expecting a GREAT book on animation, but it seems a little over-rated to me. I love old cartoons and am enthralled with the golden era, but this book doesn't live up to the 5 star rating for me. I understand it to be historical for an animation book and something that every animator should have for reference. I just don't know if this is the be all end all references for animating. I'm sure it was great for it's time. It is so fun and cute to look at now, but I have learned much more from Richard William's \\"The Animator's Survival Kit\\". I won't give up this book, I do love it. I just think it's over rated.

B0000027I6|5.0|I obtained this CD when it first came out and I think I listened to it once or twice, then stored it away for years with the impression that it was just a collection of rambling tunes and sounds, hard to follow and containing no real down and out, full balls-out musical grooves like Mr. Waters can deliver when he wants. Maybe I've just matured a little since then, thinking more about substance than style, but since I brought it out again I've listened to it over and over and over and am simply amazed at what I've been missing. The overall product is a statement on the scary direction civilization seems to be to be heading, usually in the search of the almighty dollar and in the wars we wage. The production is stunning and the lyrics are scathing. As the CD begins, we hear a very old man quietly recounting what seems like a fascinating story at first but you quickly realize that it is a terrible one, and that you are listening to a veteran of the First World War. The songs that follow illustrate the idea of how civilizations justify their behaviors in war, arms races, global domination etc., the state of technology and the ever-increasing obsessions we/they have with all things material, and not the things that really, really matter. Heady stuff, once again from Mr. Waters but I wouldn't expect anything less. After the music reaches its ultimate conclusion we return once again to the veteran and the conlusion of his story and the real impact of everything hits the heart; He is the whole point. He is the human element and because his delivery is so mild and unassuming, because he sounds on the surface like he could be talking about anything but the terrible tragedy he has carried with him all his life, the poignancy is all the more overwhelming. How many millions of him are out there?

B000LPS3B2|4.0|Spooky Thai horror film \\"Shutter\\" (2004) is actually shot by two young directors Banjong Pisanthanakun and Parkpoom Wongpoom, both still in their 20s. They were mainly working on TV commercials in Thailand before making feature film debut with \\"Shutter\\" which went on to become Thailand's biggest hit in 2004. Their profile reminds me of David Fincher who tends to create films with styles over content, but \\"Shutter\\" is not just about elaborate images and camerawork. <br /> <br />The film also resembles some other films made in English-speaking countries - at least, its beginning. We see a college student Jane (Natthaweeranuch Thongmee) and a young photographer Tun (Ananda Everingham) at the wedding party for one of Tun's friends. After the party, they head for their home by car at night, but their car hits a woman who fell on the ground and does not move. Getting scary of the accident, they leave the spot without calling the police or hospital. <br /> <br />The situation is similar to \\"I Know What You Did Last Summer\\" so far. Weird things start to happen around Tun and Jane, but the story takes a completely different direction when they come to learn more about the woman whom they think they might have killed. The story is told in a typically Asian horror fashion, like \\"The Ring\\" (or \\"The Ringu\\"), \\"Grudge\\" (or \\"Ju-on\\" if you like) and \\"The Eye,\\" connecting the episodes in the past with those in the present. <br /> <br />[SPIRIT PHOTOS] One unique point about \\"Shutter\\" is the use of its photos, especially \\"spirit photos\\" photos with a strange shadow or face in the picture. It's not the same as the photos David Warner took in \\"Omen\\" - those used in \\"Shutter\\" are totally different kind, and the film will show you how different. Like the cursed video of \\"The Ring,\\" the photos play an important role in the film's otherwise orthodox storytelling, where you find conventional narrative techniques used effectively with the directors' original styles. Some of you might not findthe film so scary as they thought, but even they would sometimes think \\"how did they shoot that?\\" <br /> <br />Most people would find \\"Shutter\\" creey and scary, but the film's scare is created not by gore or blood, but by its atmosphere. Don't miss the final cut which you should watch very closely ....
B00005JPKC|5.0|Letters From Iwo Jima depicts the Japanese side of the battle on Mount Suribachi.  The film is an attempt to portray the humanistic qualities of Japanese soldier, and not so much focus on the ravage combat scenes that occurred on the island but rather the activities inside the crevasses of the caves that the soldiers occupied at an attempt to maintain Japanese possession of Mount Suribachi.  There are similar battle scenes that were shown during Flags of Our Fathers, but the emphasis is the soldiers.<br /><br />Eastwood focuses on two of the characters, General Tadamichi Kuribayashi (Ken Watanabe) and a baker and young soldier, Saigo (Kaizunari Ninomayi), and parallels their lives and to the war experience.  Through short conversations and long silences and interactions between Japanese soldiers and American soldiers, Eastwood is effective in conveying the Japanese perspective.  Certain scenes may shock and disturb viewers who are not familiar with the events that coincided with what occurred during the Pacific War - a war heavily fought with psychological warfare and propaganda in mind.  For example, as Japanese soldiers talk about American soldiers they too describe them as savage and inhumane.  Where have we heard that before?  They were depicted in propaganda cartoons, which spread racist and jingoist fervor within the minds of those who believed it.  But what is interesting about this film as well as Flags of Our Fathers is that both raises questions about morality, sacrifice, and brutality among enemy combatants as well as concerns of human rights during times of war.<br /><br />Bottom line, Letters From Iwo Jima is revisionist history, which revises one's perception of Japanese and American soldiers during World War II.  Eastwood emphasizes the humanistic qualities of each soldier portrayed in the movie including the commanding officer of the Japanese army, which show that they too were human; they too left family behind and hastily wrote letters home to loved ones.  There are subtle scenes of humor in the film, but with a tinge of irony, such as when a few soldiers suffer extreme cases of dysentery, but are able to laugh about it.  And another is with Baron Nishi (Tsuyoshi Ihara), a debonair and \\"playboy-like\\" officer, who oddly enough lands on the island with his prized horse.  Scenes involving Nishi is a short respite from the battle front, and this is displayed as he comforts a wounded American soldier from Oklahoma, Sam, that he takes in as a prisoner of war and nurses the soldier's wounds despite the dismay from Japanese soldiers.  In the little time that he spends with Sam, he shares with him a little piece of information about his own life when he was an Olympic athlete during the 1932 Olympics in California, possibly an equestrian, who happened to know two Hollywood actors of the day, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks.  What is ironic about this scene is a preceding scene in which another American soldier was dragged into the Japanese army's cave, but suffered a much greater consequence.<br /><br />Letter From Iwo Jima is an intense film filled with unanswered inquiries, which opens the door for discussion.  Undeniably, the film raises the controversial issue of revisionist history within the context of American and Japanese history, and uncovers stereotypes and misconceptions.  This film is recommended viewing for anyone interested in having a better understanding of the Pacific War and history in general.are subtle scenes of humor in the film, but with a tinge of irony, such as when a few soldiers suffer extreme cases of dysentery, but are able to laugh about it.

B000LC4CVA|4.0|We had purchased the first Celtic Woman DVD and really enjoyed these beautiful ladies singing, and we were stunned with the performance of the lady playing the violin. We had never seen anyone play the violin in such an animated way. And when we heard the second DVD was out and that the group of ladies now included the young New Zealand sensention Hayley Westenra, we had to buy it-- and we were not disappointed! Not sure the castle backdrop was really a great idea, though, but the show is great fun to watch and listen to.

B00005JPLU|5.0|For those of you who haven't seen this film, and want to know if the trip is worth it: The Answer is YES! The film is an amazing achievement for popcorn flicks, epics, and visual effects alike. The digital backdrops are worth the price of admission alone, and the battles have enough flying limbs and gore to make a butcher cringe. However, this film will only be enjoyable to a certain demographic. First of all, smaller children should NOT be attending this film. With the gore and nudity, this is not a family motion picture. Also, those looking for story over substance will be sorely dissapointed. This is an action film aimed at mixing amazing visuals with stunning fights. This is a great theatrical experience, and will not dissapoint if you know what to expect... <br /> <br />  The general story: The historical event this film is roughly based off of is the battle of thermopylae, but the film is more an adaption of the Frank Miller comic of the same name. Do not go into the movie expecting a historicaly accurate film. There are mutants, gods, and other mythical creatures from the comics! The name \\"300\\" refers to a group of 300 spartans who make a final stand against Xerxes and his massive Persian army.They defend Sparta while also holding off the Persians until Greece agrees to send their army. The film focuses around the soldiers in battle, and the political debates in Sparta regarding the war. <br /> <br /> If you enjoy epic action films like \\"Gladiator\\" or \\"Lord of the Rings\\", unique visual films like \\"Sin City\\" or the recent \\"Fountain\\", or just want a fun time with some friends, \\"300\\" will be the right choice for you. The acting(Gerard Butler as King Leonidas will make YOU want to run into a battle with nothing but a spear) and battles are intense, the score epic, and the effects jaw-dropping. This film is brilliant because it succeeds so well at what it tried to accomplish, and that is being a stylish action film. Go see it, have fun, and then see it again. <br/> <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED <br /> <br />

B000MNP2KI|5.0|I wasn't happy upon hearing about MGM's misfortunes and purchase by Sony.  I was especially unhappy upon hearing of a re-booting for James Bond as well, having grown somewhat fond of Pierce Brosnan in the role of agent 007, even though his films had grown stale over time, but little did I know just how good things would get.  Casino Royale is just the kick in the pants that the long running franchise has needed; inserting Daniel Craig (Layer Cake, Road to Perdition, Munich) as James Bond, as well as overhauling everything else.  This time around deals with Bond's origin as he sets off on his first mission as a double-O; getting involved in an ultra-high stakes poker game to nail a scarred, inhaler puffing terrorist financier (Mads Mikkelsen) who weeps blood.  Things get a little more complicated when Bond falls head over heals for treasury agent Vesper Lynd (Eva Green) as the twisty plot unfolds over the course of the film's running time; which also includes some spectacular action sequences, stunt work, violence which pushes the limits of the film's PG-13 rating, and a torture scene that really will make you wince.  Martin Campbell, who directed Brosnan's debut as Bond with Goldeneye, leaves a considerable mark with Casino Royale, providing nearly everything he did that made Goldeneye a memorable Bond film.  And as far as Craig goes as the new 007, well, he's great.  He has the right mix of charisma, style, and dark demeanor that it takes to be a great Bond, and he fits the mold like a well tailored suit.  Judi Dench returns as M, but don't expect any Q, John Cleese, or Moneypenny here.  Indeed, as said before, Casino Royale is the kick in the teeth that the James Bond franchise needed, and fresh air is breathed into the franchise from Craig, Campbell, and everyone else involved.  Undoubtadly the best Bond film in years, Casino Royale is a treat for Bond fans new and old alike.
B00005JPO8|5.0|I must confess I went into seeing \\"The Lives of Others\\" with some apprehension. I didn't know much about it other than that spying was involved. Much to my surprise, I left the theatre glad that I had gone to see the Oscar winning film.<br /><br />The story of \\"The Lives of Others\\" takes place in 1984 in East Berlin, when both Germanys were still separated by the wall as well as politics. Ulrich Muhe plays Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler, a member of the Stasi. He is hired to spy on Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) for suspicious activities.  In the beginning of the film Wiesler is portrayed as a cold, calculating, loyal member of the Stasi who does not question the authority of the Stasi or government. As the film progresses on, the more Wiesler observes his subject and his gorgeous girlfriend Christa-Maria Siedland (Martina Gedeck), I began to slight changes in Wiesler's demeanor. Life begins to appear in Wiesler's eyes after years of working as a member of the Stasi. These changes eventually effects Wiesler's assignment and he makes choices that drastically alters both his subject's and his own life.<br /><br />I was so impressed that this was the movie debut of director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. The details Florian went into to portray life in East Germany prior to the wall coming down was so well thought out. Although the story is fictional, Florian did an amazing job at portraying life in communist East Germany as accurate as possible. For a film that was almost 2.5 hrs long, I thought time flew by for me. The performances were so well done. For me, Ulrich Muhe is the star of the film. Seeing his personality change ever so slightly through out the film was so compelling to watch. Seeing him change from being so cold to so vulnerable was quite heartbreaking especially his scenes with Martina Gedeck. Not many actresses today are able to convince me of their character's vulnerability and anguish but Martina Gedeck succeeds where most actresses fails for me. Her performance as Christa-Maria was tremendous with her subtle,nuanced skills as an actress.<br /><br />There honestly wasn't anything about \\"The Lives of Others\\" that I did not like. The writing was excellent. It did not insult the filmgoer's intelligence with bad diaogue and over the top action sequences. The filmmaker relied more on suspense and character development. Everyone's performances were wonderful. Now if only filmmakers from this country could do as good of a job as Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. They could learn a lot from this newcomer on how to make a film that doesn't insult the filmgoer's intelligence.performance as Christa-Maria was tremendous with her subtle,nuanced skills as an actress.  <br /> <br />There honestly wasn't anything about \\"The Lives of Others\\" that I did not like.

B000002C2E|1.0|I bought this based on rave reviews not long after it was first released. I played it twice and gave it away. I just don't get it. I like his first three records, (the acoustic folk and protest ones) and \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" and \\"New Morning\\" and a few others in his extensive catalogue, but the people who rave about \\"Time Out of Mind\\" and \\"Blood on the Tracks\\" are dwellers on a different planet. I found this one boring and bleak, personal but pointless.
B0009X7664|4.0|A friend and I were talking about this movie she'd bought and I remembered it from school  (many yrs ago). I thought my son might enjoy it. He did and so did my husband and I. It said that it had some photo's with it but they where not in side when I opened it. The package was sealed like it had never been opened, the the packing company must have forgot them. It would have been nice to get them but we didn't. I'd recomend people buying this move, it's a great classic.
B00005JPLU|5.0|Honestly I didn't even want to see this film. I was dragged to it and was pleasantly surprised at how good it was. It had everything. Action, love, hate and all that. I really love that it didn't have any A list actors. I am sick of seeing the same actors and dumb movies over and over again. This was good and I can't wait to get the DVD.
0071359168|5.0|Buying this book is a no-brainer. If you are an entrepreneur (without a marketing background), as I am, this book will completely change how you position your company, craft your sales message, develop website content, and explain what you do. <br /> <br />If you are developing a new product or service it is often hard to communicate the value of your offering: you get so caught up in features that you have a hard time explaining the benefits. Customers could care less about features, the want to know \\"what will it do for me?\\" This book sets you down the right path. <br /> <br />Simply put, it is THE most important business book I have ever read. If I could only choose one more business book to read for the rest of my life, I would read this one again.
B000BTGY1O|4.0|I really like this movie. It is very cute and different from Audrey Hepburns other rolls. I think that she and George Peppard do a great job and I would recommend it to anybody that likes happy, romantic movies.In this movie Audrey plays an escort and George Peppard plays a Gigolo and they wind up living in the same apartment building. Of course I'm sure you can figure out what happens.

B00003CXHJ|3.0|I recommend the collector's edition of U-571 for anyone with a good home theatre system (or anyone who enjoys a great suspense yarn in a wartime setting). You feel right inside the stricken sub as it sits quietly underwater trying to evade the destroyers - the ping.....ping of the sonar runs around your speakers and mixes in with the sound of rivets creaking under pressure. <br /> <br />An excellent follow on movie to U571 is the brilliant Enigma (about the way the Allies broke the U-boat code).
B000MGUZM0|4.0|(\\"Neon Bible\\" by the Arcade Fire)<br /><br />Easily the most anticipated album of 2007, at least if you're a member of the press, or at least an indie-music obsessive.  The question is: does it deserve all the attention, the major articles in the New York Times Magazine, the massive amount of internet chatter (over on the music discussion site RateYourMusic, it became the #1 album of the year well before it was even released!)?  The answer, at least in the humble opinion of yours truly, is a definite maybe.<br /><br />One of the reasons the Arcade Fire's debut, \\"Funeral,\\" became so justifiably celebrated was in the band's ability to turn songwriter Win Butler's very personal and emotional lyrics into often grand soundscapes while never sounding bloated or self-important.  On \\"Neon Bible,\\" nearly every track is an anthem, played with as much grand symphonic glory as any pop music ever has--it's almost as if Phil Spector decided to take an interest in indie rock.  Yes, you may indeed cue the strings, but there's even a ginormous pipe organ on a couple of tracks, which is of course in line with the album's title, but it certainly doesn't make for a more intimate album.  Even on tracks sans organ or strings, the seven piece band almost always go for the full Sturm und Drang approach.  This works out very well on dissonant rockers like \\"Black Mirror\\" or \\"Black Wave/Bad Vibrations.\\"  On the Leonard Cohen-like \\"Ocean of Noise,\\" what could have been a very nice, intimate reprieve from the bombast is undercut by the strings and a horn section late in the song.  Some tracks also show a distinct \\"Born To Run\\"-era Springsteen influence (on the very un-Springsteenian-titled \\"Antichrist Television Blues\\"), and, appropriately enough, more than a touch of gospel.<br /><br />Despite that, and the album's title, \\"Neon Bible\\" is a decidely secular album, steeped in doubt and anxiety.  \\"There's a fear I keep so deep/Knew its name before I could speak\\" Butler sings on \\"Keep the Car Running.\\"  The fear of a faith-based apocalypse turns up on the title track, which warns \\"Not much chance for survival/if the Neon Bible is right.\\"  There's more than a touch of anger in Butler's worldview, too: \\"Windowsill\\" includes the linee \\"Don't wanna fight in a holy war/...I don't wanna live in America no more.\\"  Mostly, though, they manage to keep politics in check--whatever else you can say about them, Arcade Fire's music is never less than deeply felt.<br /><br />That's why it's a bit of a disappointment that they felt the urge to make such a grand statement.  \\"My Body is a Cage\\" starts out as a wonderfully low-key blues number, but the booming drums and swirling pipe organ declare that this is a Major Statement.  While this album is far better than the pomposity of '70s dinosaurs like Yes or '00s dinosaurs like My Chemical Romance (and I liked their current \\"Black Parade\\" album!), I wish they didn't have to announce their ambitions so loudly.  Of course, the wonderful irony at the heart of the album is wonderful--this is the most depressing music you've ever been uplifted by--I just wish they'd approach their intelligent design with a bit more subtlety.  While this \\"Bible\\" ain't holy, it's more than worth preaching to the choir about.ar Running.\\"  The fear of a faith-based apocalypse turns up on the title track, which warns \\"Not much chance for survival/if the Neon Bible is right.\\"  There's more than a touch of anger in Butler's worldview, too: \\"Windowsill\\" includes the linee \\"Don't wanna fight in a holy war/...I don't wanna live in America no more.\\"  Mostly, though, they manage to keep politics in check--whatever else you can say about them, Arcade Fire's music is never less than deeply felt. <br /> <br />That's why it's a bit of a disappointment that they felt the urge to make such a grand statement.  \\"My Body is a Cage\\" starts out as a wonderfully low-key blues number, but the booming drums and swirling pipe organ declare that this is a Major Statement.

0618680004|5.0|Dawkins' book about the God delusion is important for rational people. It's bracing and well-written. He is a bit aggressive here and there, but he needs to be: Organized religion is more obnoxious by far (big buildings, for one thing), and atheists don't organize by nature. We need an advocate. Dawkins carefully takes apart the airs of superiority religion uses to mask its questionable nature and goals, and reveals that mostly it is appallingly unsupportable and unnecessary. \\"Imagine\\" indeed. Recently, I was walking through an airport when two nuns in habits passed, and I found myself thinking, \\"Cute, there go two ladies who believe in fairies and dress the part.\\" They seemed as irrelevant as Trekkies in costume, and stranger because it truly is their life. Thank you Dawkins for raising this consciousness at a time when our culture teeters on the brink of fundamentalism that is no less frightening than that of the mullahs.
0618477942|5.0|Alison Bechdel's superlative \\"Fun Home\\" is a memoir of her coming of age (not to mention coming out) told in the format of a graphic novel.  Bechdel's rendering of her family history is captivating and intriguing, thanks to the heartfelt portrayals of her family members.  Her father in particular is a deep, moving figure -- which is only fitting because it is Bechdel's relationship with her father that takes center stage in the memoir.  You get a distinct sense that Bechdel is still coming to terms with her father's role in her life more than twenty-five years after his accidental (?) death in 1980 after being struck by a truck -- an incident that Bechdel believes may have been suicide.  You see, Bechdel's father was a complicated man.<br /><br />\\"Dad's death was not a new catastrophe but an old one that had been unfolding slowly for a long time\\" (pg. 83).  On the outside, Bechdel and her father couldn't be more opposite: he an 'effeminate' aesthete who adores flowers and decorating, she a 'butch' utilitarian whose rebellious spirit defies his general conformity.  The truth is that they are mirror images of each other -- the same shape, but moving in the opposite direction.  This becomes startlingly clear to Bechdel in college after she comes out to her parents as a lesbian, and her mother confesses that her father has been having gay affairs for years -- usually with his high school students.  It is a realization that brings Bechdel and her father closer together even as it pushes them apart; for no matter how alike they are she can never reconcile his actions with proper behavior.  They seem to have come from the same mold, so how did they end up so differently -- Bechdel an out-and-proud lesbian living the life she was meant to live, and her father a repressed, unhappy family man who had to resort to extremes to fulfill his desires?  Was he a coward?  The main difference, sadly, could just be a question of timing.  At one point Bechdel wonders \\"Would I have had the guts to be one of those Eisenhower-era butches? ... Or would I have married and sought succor from my high school students?\\"  A compelling, sad question in history, and one that neither she nor the reader will ever be able to answer.<br /><br />Indeed, Bechdel still seems confounded by her father.  The fact of his untimely death left too many unanswered questions, too many unresolved issues, and \\"Fun Home\\" is a theraputic exercise for Bechdel to re-examine her family history and expel its demons.  Thank goodness she's a clear, level-headed, and reasonable woman, because \\"Fun Home\\" could easily have delved into egoism and navel-gazing, and it doesn't.  Instead, Bechdel crafts a spellbinding narrative that both devastates and uplifts as it enlightens both reader and author.  Her candor is so awe-inspiring, her self-awareness so keen, and her insights so profound that you just want to sit down with her and talk over coffee sometime.  And the illustrations are perfect.  She captures such complex ranges of emotions, and the wear-and-tear of existence shows on her parent's faces as they age over time.  Most pictures sublimely capture a sense that they are real moments in time -- almost photographic in quality.<br /><br />Count this a must-read.

B00005JPLU|1.0|I saw this bomb in the theaters.  It is billed as \\"...battle is said to have inspired all of Greece to band together against the Persians, and helped usher in the world's first democracy.\\"  Too bad the other reviewers didn't bring up the point that the Greeks were evacuated and Athens was razed to the ground.  Only after they got severly trounced did the Greeks reform and fight back and ...LATER... brought about the first lasting democracy.  The battle of Thermomopae, was a definite retrospectivly high point for the Greeks but it was hardly victory.  Save you money and get 1962 version \\"The 300 Spartans\\"  It is a far superior telling of the tale.
B000002VCE|5.0|This is the Outlaws best album! The more I listen to it, to more I enjoy it- from the great percusion to the truly amazing guitars. I have a hard time with some of the folksy, California country music vibe of some of the studio albums- but thats not a problem with this live recording. If you only buy one Outlaw album- this is the one to get!
B000MNP2KI|4.0|<br />    Having been one of those people who had strong reservations about the choice of Daniel Craig as James Bond number 6, I have to say I was blown away with surprise at how good he actually turned out to be in the role. <br />He is charismatic, has a strong, dominating \\"camera presence\\", is very athletic and believable in fight scenes (unlike Roger Moore and more like George Lazenby), can project intense ruthlessness through demeanor and eye work (watchfulness as well ; he constantly looks as though he is scanning rooms, doorways, and personages for any signs of access, egress, or danger...something any real field operative would automatically do). <br />All in all Mr. Craig lays down a solid James Bond characterization that almost seems like Sean Connery channeled through Steve McQueen (although that would seem a paranormally strange proposition).  <br /> <br />  Connery, the template and yardstick for all Bond performances, is still \\"Numero Uno\\", and always will be (you have to expect that, because in defining the character in the earliest films, not only Saltzman, Broccoli, and Terence Young were shaping the product and the performance, but so was Ian Fleming, who was still alive then and contributing input on the stories and the character portrayals...you will find plenty of photos of Fleming conversing with Connery, giving him pointers). Daniel Craig, however, turns in such a tremendous performance here in \\"Casino Royale\\" that he almost has to be ranked...HAS to be....absolutely the second best 007 ever....and a close second, at that. <br /> <br />   The screenplay here is very close to the novel as well. This film, as does \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" , really does tell an Ian Fleming story. The updating to the \\"mysterious international terrorist organization\\" (which everyone on the planet seems to want to be SPECTRE) <br />is a good, logical, functional update to the old Cold War threats of the KGB and SMERSH. <br /> <br />   Some \\"reboot\\" elements are annoying here and there, though. And dishonest. The producers claim that they went back to the first 007 novel to do a \\"Batman Begins\\" type revelation of \\"How Bond Became Bond\\". No such storyline exists in the novel \\"Casino Royale\\". James Bond isn't any just-won-his-wings \\"newbie\\" in \\"Casino Royale\\"...he's a VETERAN double-O agent who (as of 1953, when the book is published) has been 007 for close on to a decade (beginning with his sniper killings of Japanese operatives in NYC during WWII). This is established quite plainly. So the \\"newbie\\" thing here is a deceit. The acquisition of the DB5 Aston Martin jars as well, as this is a car introduced in a FAMOUS scene in \\"Goldfinger\\" (the \\"I never joke about my work, 007\\" sequence between Bond and Q). Before he got the Aston, Bond drove a convertible Bentley. Now, in some sort of strange alternate reality, he has gotten the DB5 (less the Q branch \\"alterations\\") BEFORE he ever got it. A bit of a head-shaker, that. <br />It is also intensely weird to see Bond as a brand-new 007, working for an \\"M\\" (Judi Dench) that took over that position in Pierce Brosnan's \\"Goldeneye\\", when the Brosnan Bond is already a 00 of long, long standing. There is NO series continuity with this move. Again, we seem off in an alternate dimension here...a galaxy far, far away. <br /> <br />   We also have to deal with this strange notion EON productions seems to have about alternate realities when we try to process who it is Bond works for. It is acknowledged over time in the series that he works for M.I.6 (British foreign intelligence and counterintelligence). But what IS \\"M.I.6\\"? It is a COVER designation (Military Intelligence, Section 6) for the British Secret Intelligence Service (aka S.I.S.), and since the 1960s on, that fact has become more and more available to the public. Anyone can Google the web and instantly discover that S.I.S. and \\"M.I.6\\" are the same thing. Its no secret and isn't remotely difficult to discover. Yet, for somestrange reason,EON wants MI6 to be something called the \\"Military Intelligence & Security Service\\"...which it isn't. Why? Your guess is as good as mine. <br /> <br />   All these weirdnesses aside, \\"CR\\" is one entertaining movie (007 or otherwise). It has hard-charging action, absolutely wonderful stunts (particularly in an opening chase sequence and , later on, a superb airport multi-vehicle pursuit and wreck-a-thon), crackling dialog, first rate photography and editing, great sound and sound effects, out-of-sight and totally believable special effects, great acting all around AND great direction. AND the infamous and legendary bottomless chair scene from the novel IS there in the movie version. (Whew! Never thought they'd really do it...but they did). <br /> <br />The DVD includes plenty of extras on the casting and making of the film. Interviews with Craig and others. The t.v. show \\"Bond Girls Are Forever\\" is included on disc two and this is very interesting. Some packagings come with \\"Casino Royale\\" playing cards as well (mine did). <br /> <br />I recommend this DVD highly , as to the performances all around and, particularly to Daniel Craig's. Despite those strange series continuity gaffs (officially intentional) this is one STRONG, STRONG  James Bond outing....AND a movie that turns itself into a \\"bookend\\" piece for \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" , showing how two deaths by two women...both of whom Bond loved....Vesper Lynd and Tracy Di'Vicenzo... <br />turned Bond inward and put up shields against romantic involvement that persist throughout his life. He loved once...Vesper...in \\"Casino\\" and her death shut him down emotionally. Years later he took a second chance with <br />Tracy in \\"OHMSS\\"...and she died, too. After that the shutdown was largely complete. He would never risk that kind of pain again, would never let anyone get that close again. <br /> <br />Watch \\"Casino Royale\\" and enjoy it. Then watch \\"On Her Majesty's Secret Service\\" for the rest of the story. Your outlook on why James Bond is \\"the way he is\\" will likely never quite be the same. <br />
B00005K3NR|5.0|Carrie is one of those movies that makes your stomach squirm without the use of over dramatized gore or special effects. There is a creepy atmosphere throughout the movie ...maybe its the music, maybe its Sissy Spacek, or maybe its the fact that Carrie can do things with her mind that we have all dreamed of.<br /><br />This movie is a must for your horror collection.<br /><br />Stephen John Beccia<br /><br />author of The Treelanders
B000HBK3MM|5.0|I'm not sure what category I'd place this CD in. Definitely easy listening, very soothing and the messages are real. Not political, just everyday life. You can tell she has soul in her that needs to be heard. Love each track, its a pretty short CD though. One minute you're chilling, next thing you know-- It's over? Aw man...hit play for me, please.
1573229725|5.0|I really enjoyed Fingersmith, and I wasn't entirely sure that I would at first. I'm always a bit on guard about first person novels (although the two books I'm reading right now are in the first person, go figure) because in order to do a first person novel effectively, one needs to be mindful to not fall into the trap of having the narrator describe things she couldn't possibly know just because the reader needs to know those things. Another thing that can ruin a first person narrative is switching to third person for scenes in which the narrator isn't involved. That tactic can make the narrative disjointed and confusing.<br /><br />However, Sarah Waters avoided both those traps quite effectively in Fingersmith. While the perspective does change in Part 2 (and back in part 3), the perspective doesn't change to third person. It changes to the first person of one of the other characters, giving an account of events already told from the eyes of another person. I can't really describe how this is effective without spoiling the plot twists, but I just have to say that it was.<br /><br />Waters' prose was so flowing and descriptive, it truly helped me to picture the characters and the setting quite vividly. I could sympathize with most of the characters even when they did things I should hate them for. The characters had such great depth and dimension that's sometimes really lacking in a lot of modern novels. The story itself was unpredictable and it got to the point where the only thing that stopped me from reading was the fact that my eyes got tired. I would most definitely recommend this book to just about anyone.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|Even if you aren't a hard core Madonna fan, this concert is magnificent! The music, the staging, the dancers, costumes, lights, sound,... it's an experience to behold. She's still a superstar after 25+ years because of tours and concerts like this one.  I know of few other artists who have been able to evolve with our ever-changing times and still remain on top. A must see for any pop music fan.

B00001QEE9|5.0|This is one of Disney's finest animated features! The fact that it has not had a complete restoration done is mind boggling! The print here looks like it is direct from VHS. It's washed out and to make matters worse, there are no extras! There is a 2 disc Platinum edition coming in 2009, but what's the hold up? Disney seeme to skip over this classic gem and make two & three releases of other titles!??<br /><br />I rate the film 5 stars, but this DVD edition gets 2 stars. Come on Disney get on the ball and give this film the treatment it deserves. 2 discs, complete restoration and extensive extra material.
B000002H97|4.0|This album is one of the best put out by Metallica and I own pretty much all of them. However after this one I am not so sure I still like the style or direction they took, and that whole Napster fiasco certainly didn't add to their credibility in my book. What I liked about this album was the power in the lyrics and without second guessing I can say \\"Enter Sandman\\" is one of the best.<br /><br />Hopefully they go back to the old style, but I fear they probably won't.
B00013F38K|5.0|The 70's were a glorious time for TV and 'Kung Fu' is a prime example of great 70's television. David Carradine gives a fine performance as Caine and each week we would see another famous guest star. One of my favorite episodes stars his father John. I have been working my way through the first season and am really enjoying it, but there is one or two small gripes. One id the show was broadcast in full screen, but this release is in widescreen?! The second is there could be a very small amount of footage edited from the episodes. I didn't notice anything missing, but the running time seems slightly off. This shouldn't keep you from buying this great show, but its nice to know before you purchase this set. The first season set includes the pilot film and some cool extras including commentary etc. The DVD transfers are very good and show minimal wear.

B000MXPE74|5.0|From Scotland, The Fratellis cross the Atlantic and have topped the American singles sales charts with \\"Flathead\\" after scoring several independent hits back in the UK. And all I can is \\"Welcome guys - stick around a long time.\\"<br /><br />This is both a fun and funny CD that'll keep you dancing from start to finish. The Fratellis feature clever wordplay, tight harmonies, nonsense syllable hooks and are masters of song structure. Their influences are an encyclopedia of 60s, 70s and 80s bands including, but not limited to, Madness, The Beatles (as well as McCartney and Lennon individually), early Who, Led Zeppelin, Adam & The Ants and even early Green Day. But it never seems derivative or studied. They've taken the past and reshaped it for the present with the intent of having fun and making you do the same.<br /><br />They've delivered the goods. Check out \\"Doginabag,\\" \\"Baby Fratelli,\\" \\"Chelsea Dagger,\\" \\"Creeping Up The Back Stairs,\\" \\"Henrietta\\" and \\"Whistle For The Choir\\" to sample the wide variety of styles they've mastered.<br /><br />This CD is a pleasure you don't have to feel guilty about.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Neil's live archive series is off to a fantastic start.  Can't wait to see what other gems come along.  Hopefully Neil will finally decide to release a live Buffalo Springfield disc at some point.  I'm sure I'll be first in line to buy whatever Neil decides to put out next. <br /> <br />I knew this would be great, based on the bootlegs from the solo acoustic tour this was taken from.  The Los Angeles show is one of my favorite \\"unofficial\\" albums ever.  This better-sounding, official release will replace it nicely, though.
074356619X|5.0|Finally the secrets are revealed to everyone!  I saw the movie and then had to have the book and the book on CD to play in my car and remind me of all the great things that are available to me...if I only just FEEL GOOD about having them! <br />This is a must have for EVERY human, it should be taught in schools WORLD WIDE.  It would then cause us all to be self reliant and peacful with each other, no matter what!! <br />
B000K7UBTI|1.0|I was really excited about this DVD, to my knowledge no one had ever done anything like this before, an animated movie about Ironman (COOL!!!). I wish my expectations met what I received.  The story is weak, the animation is thin and the voice acting is poor.  How could so much time have gone into something so cold, this left me feeling nothing for the characters or the storyline. I really hope more time goes into the live action version because this animated movie does not work on any level.
B000MGUZMU|5.0|First off, if you're expecting 10 more songs like Funeral, you should know better.  Every band grows with time, the best ones manage to make good music at the same time.  Arcade Fire is one of those bands, they continue to make great music while their sound progresses.  A lot of people were disappointed with \\"Achtung Baby\\" but that doesn't mean it wasn't a good album.   <br /> <br />Neon Bible is different from Funeral in that the tracks are less reliant on the edgy guitar riffs and more reliant on big thematic elements (and not just on \\"Intervention\\").  These work well juxtaposed with the angsty/troubled story lines and lyrics.  I'm still amazed at the lyric ability Ric demonstrates.  Fire fans will appreciate that Neon Bible is a more evolved sound, but the roots of it are very clearly embedded in Funeral.  After two times listening through the album I'd be willing to bet you'll have the songs stuck in your head, just like you did after listening to Funeral.   <br /> <br />Overall, this is a terrific album.  I'd put it at least on equal footing with Funeral, possibly even better.  You won't be disappointed.
B00000IMTH|4.0|Rainbow's 3rd album with Dio is a classic!<br /><br />It's ashame at the time critics and fans<br /><br />didn't realize it!

The title track as<br /><br />well as Kill the King, The Shed are just<br /><br />killers and the awesome Rainbow eyes is<br /><br />just the greatest slow song ever written.<br /><br />They don't make rock n roll like this anymore<br /><br />and I feel sorry for kids today that never<br /><br />will hear great bands like this!
0316172324|5.0|Blink is an intriguing essay that dives into the human mind and explorers the power of the unconcious mind.  Gladwell catches the reader right from the start and tries to get the reader to come to become more self-aware of his or her unconcious mind through reading the book.  Gladwell makes it very clear from the beginning of the book what he is trying to prove.  First, he wants to prove that the decisions made instinctly (snap-judgments) are just as valid and sometimes even more valid than decisions made through concious analysis and rationalization.  Gladwell provides a plethora of examples to aid this argument, and although quite interesting, he only proves that snap judgments are worthy of more attention than they currently receive.  However, Gladwell is unsuccessful in proving that snap judgments are just as valid as a concious, rationalized thought process.  He provided many examples; however, at times he is \\"blind\\" to the comfort and logic through a concious thought process.  If he were to give more credit to the importance of the concious mind, his argument regarding snap judgments would have been more effective.  Gladwell's second task was to prove that we should trust our instincts.  Again, he provides plenty of examples to support this, and offers detailed analysis, but the argument is nothing more than an intriuging theory.  Gladwell's third task is to prove that snap judgments can be educated and controlled, and he is very succesfful with his argument.  Through his examples of the IAT Tests and War Games in chapters 3 and 4, Gladwell proves that snap judgments can be trained, and that the snap judgments of experts in certain areas are more valid than that of the \\"Average Joe\\".  In conclusion, Gladwell's overall argument isthat if snap judgments are seen as valid and trustworthy and if snap judgments are educated, the world would be a different and better place.  Gladwell is not directly effective in proving this to the reader.  He provides few strong examples, such as the Diallo case, and he is unable to substaniate that very large claim.  However, indirectly, I feel that Gladwell is successful in his purpose.  I feel that Gladwell targets this book at more of a younger audience with the idea that although we will not take direct action to train our snap judgments, we will unconciously begin to question our actions and motives after reading the book.  Although Gladwell is not able to get his readers to go out and speak up, he is able to indirectly and unconciously make an impression on the readers' frame of thinking towards the world around them.  After reading Blink, go to a public location where there are a lot of people.  See if you act differently than from how you would before you read Gladwell's book.  You'll begin to notice a slight change in the way you think. <br /> <br />Overall, Blink is an excellent book that is most intriguing to younger audiences but still has something in it for everyone.  Next time you meet somebody new, size them up in a second...in the blink of an eye.  Do not forget your intial impression of them. Then, after you've known the person for a while, compare your intial impression to your impression after knowing them for a long time.  Where you right?  Where you off? Why?  Did something in your mind cause your intial impression?  Did a false intial impression prove to be harmful to your relationship with the person?  Blink investigates these questions, and surfaces their disastrous outcomes, yet promising potential. <br />
B000002U9W|5.0|I think the Wikipedia page on Atom Heart Mother says all that needs to be said about this fine classic Floyd album.  Either you like it or you don't.  I'd go as far as to say that if you really like Pink Floyd, I mean *REALLY* like Pink Floyd, then you'll probably enjoy this album.  If all you know of Floyd is Dark Side of the Moon and The Wall, you will probably find this experimental album a bit strange and maybe even painful to hear.
B000KCHZK6|4.0|I love Norah Jones minimalist style and I had high hopes for this album. I was not disappointed... well mostly not disappointed. It doesn't capture the impact and excitment of her debut but then again what could? It was an amazing, historic album. I kind of think this album needs to be taken as a whole - for me there wan't a stand-out hit - but it is one of the few albums I've listended to in recent years where I can sit and listen to the whole thing and enjoy it.
B00003XAQ5|5.0|On par with Dave Brubeck's \\"Time Out,\\" Kind of Blue set the stage for the Jazz genre by being completely infused with \\"cool,\\" which at the time totally defined \\"hip\\" and of course \\"Jazzy.\\" <br /> <br />You don't need a recommendation to buy this album.  If you don't buy it, you can never call your collection Complete... <br /> <br />Oh yes, this is a SACD Multichannel recording.  Which essentially means that it can only be played on a SACD-capable player.  It is hands-down the finest quality of recording available to the general public.  Do yourself a favor: if you own a SACD player and you like jazz, buy this album.  Do it NOW!!
6302517028|5.0|I find the movie highly entertaining, but what really knocks my socks off is how the script has many lines that incorporate the metaphysics of modern life better than any reality-based attempt to describe what life is like. The slim chance of success that \\"crossing the streams\\" produces, facing a gigantic \\"Stay Puft\\" marshmellow man, a building in New York City that is spook central, the \\"Get him out of here\\" line applied to a fruitbasket from the EPA, and the frightful technology of capturing ghosts after the first attempt in the New York City Public Library was so scary and the main character got slimed in the second attempt in a New York City hotel, the messes that everything created: all of it is still so apt.
B000KGGLCU|5.0|If anyone is a Madonna fan and saw this concert...this DVD/CD is a must have! If you didn't get a chance to catch this concert..you have to buy it! The DVD/CD is amazing and easy to watch again & again!
6303234844|5.0|I did not look at the cover for the videotape closely enough to see Paula Cole's name until today. I probably heard her voice on the 2-CD set years ago without thinking about it, but when I saw her performing in the concert, she was really there. I have not seen her often enough to know it was her, but I should have guessed that she could have been a star. The dance routines that Peter Gabriel does with people in the band were a stitch. I don't think there is a better word than stitch for how together it was. The stage set-up and props were fantastic. `Steam' and `Shaking the Tree' had special effects that seemed to be what the songs were about.
B000K4WPCC|3.0|The Covenant had great special effects (the kind that make me go \\"Wow!\\", anyway), things exploding, a pretty original plot, and lots of boy flesh.  That makes it a nearly perfect movie in my book.  Not overly exciting, but it does come from the people who brought us Underworld and Underworld:  Evolution, so...you get the general idea.  Dark, brooding young man and pretty hot chick unite against bad guy.  Nice diversion, which is all I ask from movies anymore.
B00000FC5H|5.0|This album is soooo hot! Makes you wanna just jump up on a table and start dancing.  (I tried it at work, but they yelled at me!).  I am LOUSY at remembering song names, but I recognized a bunch of them.  \\"September\\" is so hot! and one of my favorites. So is \\"Boogie Wonderland\\" (Dance, Ooo ooo oo, Dance, ooo ooo ooo!) (STOP ME!  QUICK!) Like I said, most of the album is hot dance-to-me music.  There are a few slow songs, like \\"After the Love Has Gone\\". 17 tracks at a total running time of a hair over 1 hour 7 minutes.<br /><br />Don't put this on in the car and get behind a school bus!  Torture!
1577314808|2.0|It seems true that if we remain in the present we will be happier and more at peace - energy won't be drained from regret or worry - but I sense there's more to enlightenment than that, and the author offers no actual instruction on how to achieve this end.  There are better books out there for the spiritually inclined, like God Without Religion or God Talks With Arjuna.

B00005JPLU|5.0|I had very high expectations from this film the second that I saw it's trailer. It definitley did not let me down. The Pros and Cons of this film are:<br /><br />Pros:<br /><br />-Very artistically done<br /><br />-Great character chemistry<br /><br />-Nonstop action<br /><br />-Put humor in all the right places<br /><br />Cons:<br /><br />-Some of the \\"creatures\\" almost made you laugh, and question if they were actually necessary<br /><br />Honestly that's the only negative to say about this movie. It's almost a perfect mix between Gladiator and Lord of the Rings. So if you like those two movies, you'll love this movie!
B000M5AJQS|5.0|What's the difference between A-list actors and B-list actors?<br /><br />An A-list actor can be in many different movies, and most of the A-list actor's performances are memorable. However, each performance is remembered for its individuality.<br /><br />A B-list actor turns in forgettable performances, and usually isn't in a lot of movies (that are good).<br /><br />Matt Damon, Leo DiCaprio and especially Jack Nicholson reaffirm their A-list status with flying colors in The Departed. How many movies have you seen Jack Nicholson in? How after being in so many movies can you keep your performances fresh? My expectation was that I'd go into The Departed and have an experience where the Nicholson character was unoriginal, familiar or unbelievable because the portrayal would be so diluted by other Nicholson performances. So much for my expectation.<br /><br />Nicholson's portrayal of Frank Costello was realistic and refreshing. You don't see Jack Nicholson \\"in another role\\"; you see Frank Costello. That's an A-list actor.<br /><br />The movie as a whole was just excellent. A great story. Engrossing. Believable. Suspenseful. And the twists were on target; even though you mostly knew who the rats were and what side they were on, the deceptions effectively keep the viewer slightly confused as to who is really working for who. The movie keeps you captivated from start to finish.<br /><br />The Departed and its Director have been justifiably showered with praise and awards. The Departed is by far the best new movie that I've seen in years. It's a collector; add it to your cart.

B0000026TD|5.0|Put the CD in and close your eyes and be prepared for a journey. It's very evocative of emotions of love and romance. Absolutely beautiful. The atmosphere is one of closeness... perfect for a backdrop of a romantic evening or to put in headphones during a stressful day.<br /><br />The reason I stumbled onto it (released in 1988 and bought by me in 2007) is the background singer Patti Austin. Anything Patti is in I buy.<br /><br />I have heard of Andreas Vollenweider from the smooth jazz stations but never paid him any special attention. I have been missing out for many years. I'm sure I'm in the dark about many artists and am grateful that Amazon and other sites have the listen feature.<br /><br />Will add more later. Still listening.

B000002WU9|5.0|I am truly a Wu-tang Clan fan and Raekwon the Chef was always a favorite of mine because he was so heartfelt in all his rhymes.  I enjoyed listening to him talk about his Wallebee Clarks and Only Build for Cuban Linx seriously made a lyrical statement for him.  Although a part II could surface, this is truly a classic and it's set in a good time in rap history-1995.  It was something about that year-EVERYTHING was good, but then it changed, however, to sit and listen to it makes me feel good.  I went on Ebay and they wanted $26.00 for a used CD, so people want to hear the Raekwon spit.....Peace.
B000B5XOY8|1.0|Batman Begins is soooo much better than this or any other of the batman movies. Nicholson SUCKED as the Joker. Joker is a comedian who had an accident trying to pull a robbery to help his pregnant wife. HE IS NOT A GANGSTER OR THE ONE WHO KILLED BATMAN'S PARENTS!!!! HE IS A PSYCHO AND BATMAN'S NEMESIS!!! YOU CAN'T KILL HIM OFF!!! HOW STUPID IS THAT?!!! Who came up with that one. Keaton is a sissy, Christian Bale could beat him down!!! Keaton DID NOT have the physical prescence to play Batman. All in all, a joke of a comic movie..But it is better than Daredevil!!!!:-)
B00006DEF9|5.0|Singin In the Rain is arguably the best movie musical of all time, not just because of the music but because of the entire package - the premise, the comedy, the characters - everything here works together to make you feel better any time you sit down to watch it. It's ironic that this movie was thrown together quickly to capitalize on the success of \\"An American in Paris\\", since the improvisational feeling of the movie is one of the things that makes it so much fun. Although this film is number ten on the top 100 films of all time as compiled by the American Film Institute, it wasn't nominated for best picture the year of its release, 1952. Although it did well at the box office, it would be over twenty years before people would look back and realize just what a great motion picture it was. Perhaps that was because the 1970's were such bleak and cynical years, with movies that largely matched that mood, that people were eager to rediscover the fun that a motion picture viewing experience could be.<br /><br />The movie focuses on that period of time in which the entire motion picture film industry was in nervous transition from silent to talking pictures. Although the movie compresses time in this respect - the transition actually took about three years - it does accurately describe the technical problems of that era along with their comical aspects. There was an overabundance of musicals in the first batch of talking films, many stars did have heavy accents that made their speech undecipherable or voices that came across like nails on a chalkboard like Lina Lamont (Jean Hagen) and saw their careers ruined, and early sound technology itself was so fragile that you would often see actors speaking to potted plants or to coat racks with comic effect. The preview of silent picture team Lockwood and Lamont's first talkie, \\"The Dueling Cavalier\\", is one of the most hilarious scenes in the film. It is pretty typical of what you would see in such an early talking picture - dialogue going in and out of sync, actors and actresses strutting around and wildly gesturing as if nobody can hear them, and dialogue that still resembled what you would read off of the title cards in a silent film - \\"I love you, I love you, I love you\\".<br /><br />All of this is one of the reasons Singin' In The Rain will never get dated - it is a comic nostalgic look at a very narrow period in time. This movie is fun outside of its comic take on movie history, though. For one, it's hard to say who steals the show the most, since there are so many thieves involved. Most notably there is Jean Hagen - who actually has a very acceptable speaking voice - as the evil silent star who can't accept her days are numbered. Then there is a 27 year-old Donald O'Connor as Cosmo, the studio music director and sidekick of Gene Kelly's character whose youthful exuberance really shines in the number \\"Make 'Em Laugh\\" along with all of his goofy facial expressions. He seems to be having as much fun as the audience. Finally, there are all of the great dance numbers and music, capped by probably one of the most famous scenes of all time - Gene Kelly's rendition of the title number that perfectly captures the joy of a man who has just fallen in love and feels he has the world at his feet. You just can't watch this film and not come away with a smile on your face. It is as good for the soul as chicken soup, just a lot more fun.- dialogue going in and out of sync, actors and actresses strutting around and wildly gesturing as if nobody can hear them, and dialogue that still resembled what you would read off of the title cards in a silent film - \\"I love you, I love you, I love you\\".  <br /> <br />All of this is one of the reasons Singin' In The Rain will never get dated - it is a comic nostalgic look at a very narrow period in time.

B000F7CMRM|4.0|I'll try to keep this short and sweet.<br /><br />This movie is worth renting before buying. The acting in this movie is very good, the story is both relevant and compelling. The problem with the movie -and the cause of the \\"I didn't get it\\" comments you often hear- is that there are too many \\"main characters\\", and too much of an attempt to follow all of their paths equally, instead of giving more weight to the most important ones.<br /><br />There are also a good number of what I would consider confusing characters, who perhaps get 3 or 4 minutes in the film, yet have seemingly major impacts on other characters. You're left wondering: why didn't we get a better glimpse of this person's relationship to x, y or z?<br /><br />It's definitely a \\"watch it twice\\" kind of movie otherwise the reaction will likely be \\"what the h*ll just happened?\\" So, rent it, watch twice, and if you like a movie with some ability to make you think, you'll probably want to purchase a copy. Certainly the type of movie you could watch once a year without tiring of it.

But after a few listens, I can't tell the difference in the songs-the vocal pattern is too similar with repeating phrases etc.  Just not enough diversity in the music.

In many ways, it was just another \\"cut up lots of people with swords, stick many of them with spears, and have the heroes die screaming\\" type movie.<br /><br />EXCEPT...<br /><br />-  the casting and costumes were great.<br /><br />-  the fight scenes, and cinematic style (normal speed, slow speed, normal speed, slow speed, et cetera) were bloody but phenomenal.<br /><br />-  the computer generated blood splatterings oozed the horror of close combat sword fighting.<br /><br />-  the beginning really explained why the Spartans were in such excellent physical shape.<br /><br />I didn't like the fake wolf with the glowing eyes, and the oracle attendants with their leprosy were too fake.  Spartans just wouldn't put up with that crap!<br /><br />Rated R for slight nudity and gore galore.  Not the best date movie!
B0000073BG|4.0|Definately not an album for everyone, yet Annie Haslam's vocals and John Wetton's bass playing drive this LP into the higher echelon of 70's prog rock. <br />Suffering from a lack of a strong lead guitarist, this album is sometimes too heavily keyboard dominated, but the music is strong and Renaissance reaches it's goal of translating the premise of the Arabian Nights into modern times.
6305313687|5.0|This movie is brilliant, and Edward Norton is at his best. <br /> <br />This film allows you to see everyone as a legitimate person. You understand why a black boy would shoot a white kid, as it is brought on by the cruelty of racism and violence. Yet, you also watch these seemingly normal people get sucked into an environment of racism and hatred. It permeates all aspects of society and everyone suffers from it. The purpose of the movie is not to choose a hero or a villain, because society is not that black and white. It is to reveal the consequences of hatred and how it only begets further hatred and violence. In the end, you are sad that a once-racist boy dies, not because racism is condoned, but because violence is always terrible. Derek's explanation that anger only leads to more anger is fundamental, because we see that it can never solve any problem, and is wrong from all sides.

It stands with the best of mid- seventies Yes, or Strawbs or ELP.

Judi Dench's talent is evident right off....she plays an elderly woman so well that at first I didn't recognize her. The happy ending is MUCH better than the disappointing finish of the novel, with everyone at peace (even the disapproving priest) and the chocolate shop still open in the quaint village. Highly recommend this for a romantic night in this Lent.

Who knew he had inadvertently insulted Robert Plant of Led Zeppelin with an innocent remark about lyrics? His comments on WHY this isn't the greatest Jethro Tull album of all time are also interesting, as are his comments about how musicians need to change as they grow older. Another record that is also not played out, as is so much of the music from this time period, thanks to classic rock stations and boomer movies.
1592400876|4.0|In this day and age of IM text, increasing reliance on word processing program spell checkers instead of live editors that cost money, and generally poor education in which children aren't even taught what a semicolon is or does, this book was a delight to see.<br /><br />Yes, the author is British; yes, some American readers might be confused by her colloquialisms and word usage.  That isn't the point.  Contrary to a previous reviewer, who must be even more of a punctuation and grammar freak than I am, the author does set out to do what she intended.  She points out just how far our skills in written English have fallen, and why.<br /><br />Granted, most of us don't have the leisure afforded to intellectuals to debate the use of single quotes vs double quotes.  We just need to know the proper usage for either.<br /><br />In this day and age where I can pick out at least three typos per every issue of TIME magazine and the Wall St Journal - grammatical, spelling, and/or punctuation - which would have been unheard of before someone decided that MS Word's grammar checker didn't have to be paid a salary and would suffice in place of human editors, books like this are necessary.  They should be mandatory reading for high-school English classes.
B000002GFC|5.0|I have to admit, if I never heard another Credence, Motown or Doors song, I wouldn't feel like I was missing out. To be frank, many of the sounds of my boomer youth have been so overplayed on classic rock stations or used in angst-ridden movies that I find myself unable to listen to them any more. However, Cream is not one of those bands, and listening to this disc reminded me how very rich and muscular the best of that period's music could be, before it evolved into art rock like Yes, and that ilk.  With the exception of Clapton's work with Derek and the Dominos, and I don't think any of these guys ever played as well as they did here, and I can't say enough about how good these songs are, even the goofy ones. Buy this, even if you're way too young to remember the band when it existed!

0393978672|5.0|Before reviewing this excellent book it would be best to introduce this review with an overview of the current climate when it comes to Darwin.<br /><br />Charles Darwin (a naturalist) is the father of modern Evolution (not *Evil*ultion; it is pronounced *Evo*-lution).<br /><br />Darwin's overall explanation of evolution, in this book, is not modern evolutionary biology. Modern evolution can, and does, go beyond Darwin's view.<br /><br />Darwin's model is often called Darwinism, a partially philosophical concept but mostly the science of biology and geology combined. It is widely considered to be the single most important scientific discovery of all time. Darwin's underlying points are the essentials of evolutionary biology.<br /><br />Theories are comprised of facts without gaps. Theories are factual. Theories contain facts to explain a factual instance of something material. Theories do not contain fabrications or a little bit of lies plus some truths. If a theory is not all facts then it is not a theory.<br /><br />The phrase \\"it is just a theory and not fact\\" is a contradiction of terms. A factual instance of something (such as observing speciation) needs to be explained. Facts are used to explain the factual instance of something material.<br /><br />Darwin used philosophy and biological science and earth sciences (geology) to develop the concept of natural selection which is primarily based on explaining how evolution occurs with the mechanism of `natural selection'. Darwin observed in the world about him what he believed to be the result of a single cell organism that had evolved into all forms of life we see today. More importantly, there is no chaos involved. It has order. \\"The Origin of Species\\" (TOOS) is all about Darwin discussing how he came to this conclusion.<br /><br />In the 21st Century, \\"Speciation\\" has been observed countless times. Go search right now for \\"Observed Speciation Events\\".<br /><br />***Speciation is a fact whether we can explain the mechanisms of how it works or not. This can not be understated! A fact is a fact regardless of our ability to explain how it works. Gravity existed well before Newton could explain it. Speciation exists (a new species developing in the world, under scientific observation) meaning evolution is a fact. Look at the title of this review. Nobody should have to explain evolution in order to prove it factual. ***<br /><br />Now is the time to say this. If you don't believe theories are factual, then stop engaging the results of factual science in your life right now. Walk the talk. Turn off the PC. Turn off the electricity. Turn off the heating... and walk. I will allow you the option of a bronze spear... that is if you know how to smelt bronze.<br /><br />As a note, the Catholic Church has been teaching the fact of evolution and the theory of the mechanisms of evolution in Catholic schools since the 1950s. This is exactly the same coursework that secular schools have on evolution. However there is some discrepancy over natural selection. Natural selection has order but it is not guided. This is the problem part for most religious people. One would do well however to experience thinking about natural selection without any divine guidance. This is truly the type of thinking that grasps the full impact of this work.<br /><br />The theory of the mechanisms of evolution is independent of the fact of evolution. The theory of the mechanisms of evolution is a compilation of facts (without gaps) used to explain the fact of evolution. The theory of the mechanisms of evolution is here, in part, but are much better explained and referenced by modern evolutionary biology. If its modern evolution you want (and you may well do if your first search brought you here) then go to talkorigins on the net and read about the \\"29+ evidences for macroevolution\\". It can take days, weeks months, or years, or a lifetime to parse the data, but keep going over it and it will eventually click.<br /><br />The most popular version of The Origin of Species is the one which contains the first edition published by Darwin in 1859 with an editor's introduction by J. W Burrow first published in 1968. Burrows covers the history of the work, the successive editions of the book that Darwin published and recent scientific discoveries that shed light on Darwin's theory.<br /><br />Introduction<br />Darwin in TOOS starts by describing his life and times as a naturalist. Darwin explains the problem of immutable claims about the species and goes through the historical record to show instances where people have indicated that the species are mutable. He explains that he is writing this book because Alfred Russel Wallace has drawn the same conclusions about natural selection.<br /><br />Chapter 1: Variation under Domestication<br />Darwin goes straight into variations under domestication showing that farmed animals are substantially different from their wild counterparts from which they came. Darwin did not have access to Gregor Mendel's laws of inheritance but he did guess that there was a mechanism like this responsible for variation. His bases for the assertion that species come from other closely related species is absolutely fundamentally correct by today's standards. His explanation for it was revolutionary for his time.<br /><br />Chapter 2: Variation under Nature<br />Darwin exposes the instability of the then current system of taxonomy to show that categorization and labelling is not fixed and thus questions the bases for immutability. This paves the way for the natural overview that all like organisms share commonalities and that variations can be immediate or subtle gradual changes over time. Darwin discusses intermediate forms and shows that group changes are proportional while alluding to the first shape of an evolutionary tree.<br /><br />Chapter 3: Struggle for Existence<br />Darwin presents the ecosystem and shows that all organisms struggle to survive and that this struggle influences what we, who have survived this struggle, see in the world today. Darwin shows this complex structure and connects it with such descriptions as the presence of a feline determining through the intervention of mice and then bees the frequency of certain flowers in an area.<br /><br />Chapter 4: Natural Selection<br />This is core material of how highly complex organisms are formed from organisms with lesser complexity and has still stood the test of time today. Darwin not only verifies evolution but explains its mechanism, natural selection. Using the analogy of a tree and the taxonomy of living things Darwin shows how beneficial variations in conjunction with heredity are responsible for the formation of new species gradually over long periods of time which compete and cause extinctions. Darwin establishes the foundation for common descent.<br /><br />Chapter 5: Laws of Variation<br />Darwin, without knowing Mendel's laws of inheritance, comes close to explaining it by in-depth analyses of the variations in organisms, such as the horse and cabbage. Darwin has been preparing the reader to accept that species are highly variable and that this means that ideas of a static independent design of the species without variation are highly flawed and evolution can be the only sensible conclusion drawn from the evidence.<br /><br />Chapter 6: Difficulties on Theory<br />Darwin does what religious writers avoid which is self-critic, the hallmark of scientific thinking, brings up all possible problems with his theory and slowly shows how the answers are natural even though he doesn't have them all yet, but still manages to explain the evolution of the eye by comparison to lesser complex eyes in nature as well as the evolution of flight by comparison to gliding organisms. Darwin then shows imperfections in nature, explains why they are there and pulls off a last minute rationalization for why organisms more suited for another environment live in a completely different one with natural selection.<br /><br />Chapter 7: Instinct<br />Darwin looks at complex instincts in the animal kingdom. Here Darwin examines the life of aphids and ants, revealing their instincts, turns to birds, before going back into the micro world of slave-making ants and the hive-bee, before tackling the design of complex hive honeycomb structures. Not only does Darwin show the evolution of beehives but has all along been preparing us for the slow long gradual evolution of instinct in all living things and then directly implies Mendel's laws of inheritance. Darwin amazingly demonstrates that neuter or sterile insects that perform specific tasks can be produced from parents who don't do those tasks, by way of natural selection.<br /><br />Chapter 8: Hybridism<br />In order to understand this chapter one should know that at the time the sterility of species was considered the divine indication that species where not allowed to crossbreed. Darwin using sterility examples shows the reader that there is very little to distinguish species from varieties, if they can be distinguished at all. This undermines any attempt to say that a species has an exact definition or is fixed and this is fatal to the independent creation of species hypothesis. Darwin establishes yet another proof for evolution.<br /><br />Chapter 9: On the Imperfection of the Geological Record<br />Darwin using Lyell's geology changes our view of the world. Suddenly we find that we are no longer the centre of the earth, just as Copernicus showed that we where no longer the centre of our solar system. Darwin describes geology in-depth, with the erosion of land, atom by atom, and the formation of land, atom by atom, adding that the world has seen many forms of life, gradually evolving, through a vast amount of time that we can barely comprehend. He challenges questions about the limits of the fossil record by revealing the story of life as only evident in some parts, with other parts yet to be found, if they will ever be found at all. It's a breathtaking chapter that reshapes how human beings will see themselves after reading it.<br /><br />Chapter 10: On the Geological Succession of Organic Beings<br />Now that Darwin has completely revised our world view with the evidence of evolution he proceeds to explain how geological movements over long period of time, as well as the migration of species, will create an imperfect fossil record but that this imperfect fossil record will always show organisms of lesser complexity evolving into organisms of greater complexity via the mechanism of natural selection. Darwin shows that species evolve at different rates over time and in different directions which explains the present existing complexity of life today and the scientific record of every organism that has ever lived.<br /><br />Chapter 11: Geographical distribution<br />Darwin describes a series of practical experiments that anyone can do in their own back garden involving picking seeds from bird droppings, germinating them, sinking seeds in water for 28 days, growing them, analysing the content of mud in the paws of trekking animals and then concluding that the geographical dispersal of fauna from island to island is not a mystery. Darwin then explains why similar fauna are found up mountains around the world by way of glaciers pushing and splitting primordial plant life from the ground upwards. These simple explanations are yet another blow to the suggestion of the immutability of species.<br /><br />Chapter 12: Geographical distribution -- continued<br />Without directly saying it, Darwin has been implying the common decent of all biological organisms from a single source, the origin of species. Darwin now says it but continues on the topic of distribution showing how birds can easily spread freshwater organisms and how the geological changes of streams, intersecting and separating, can spread freshwater life across the planet. Darwin joins geology with distribution presenting the historical record for all life on earth. Laws of diversity regarding degrees of complexity are introduced. Darwin has established the structure of evolutionary biology as the explanation for life. The scientific impact is immeasurable.<br /><br />Chapter 13: Mutual Affinities of Organic Beings: Morphology: Embryology: Rudimentary Organs<br />For anyone left unconvinced, for some odd reason or another, Darwin simply points to the current work in the natural system and shows that the underlying theme taxonomists have been searching for is actually common decent. Darwin then demonstrates how natural selection can create similar developments in very diverse organisms. Embryology alone is argued as evidence for common decent as Darwin illustrates that all embryos and newborn virtually look the same in some respect and that growth and aging in the lifetime of any organism is almost enough evidence alone for mutability. Finally Darwin delivers on a collection of useless organs and appendages no longer in use because they have been naturally breed out because of disuse or `inutility'.<br /><br />Chapter 14: Recapitulation and Conclusion<br />Darwin runs through all the main points of his argument for natural selection. Darwin is aware that evolution is a minority view but hopes that in the future more evidence for natural selection will appear. He says he can offer nothing to support the idea of the immutability of species and closes with a profound statement and for the first time invokes and ends with the classic word that defined his view. Darwin says, \\"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, EVOLVED.\\"<br /><br />The complex web of relations with livings things to the environment is staggering yet so obvious in hindsight. The whole point of TOOS is it is ridiculous that someone didn't get this sooner. The environment has an impact of living things and living things have an impact on the environment. This is a symbiotic relationship. There is an opportunity for improvement or deterioration in the offspring just on the basis of all possible genetic combinations. Minor changes add up to big ones.<br /><br />Darwin's findings about how the environment causes variations in living things is accurate in his proposals although his tenders are mostly humanistic with references to biology especially with regards to \\"monstrosities\\" that simply don't have any reason for things like \\"wings\\", such as some insects and some birds, if they can't fly. Vestiges are an extremely good case for evolution. The cave crab with an eye stalk without an eye is like a telescope without the lens. Darwin identifies the possibility of sex linked traits in animals, a proven point today.<br /><br />Reading TOOS is like a romance novel where the birth of something to unify the sciences further is described in a man's love for nature and his crucial discovery. TOOS is something that needs to be reread several times for the full impact. Walking around in the world today knowing that all organisms have evolved from lesser complexity to greater complexity by means of natural selection is a whole different worldview to thinking that a supernatural deity did it.

0451529065|5.0|Before reviewing this excellent book it would be best to introduce this review with an overview of the current climate when it comes to Darwin.<br /><br />Charles Darwin (a naturalist) is the father of modern Evolution (not *Evil*ultion; it is pronounced *Evo*-lution).<br /><br />Darwin's overall explanation of evolution, in this book, is not modern evolutionary biology. Modern evolution can, and does, go beyond Darwin's view.<br /><br />Darwin's model is often called Darwinism, a partially philosophical concept but mostly the science of biology and geology combined. It is widely considered to be the single most important scientific discovery of all time. Darwin's underlying points are the essentials of evolutionary biology.<br /><br />Theories are comprised of facts without gaps. Theories are factual. Theories contain facts to explain a factual instance of something material. Theories do not contain fabrications or a little bit of lies plus some truths. If a theory is not all facts then it is not a theory.<br /><br />The phrase \\"it is just a theory and not fact\\" is a contradiction of terms. A factual instance of something (such as observing speciation) needs to be explained. Facts are used to explain the factual instance of something material.<br /><br />Darwin used philosophy and biological science and earth sciences (geology) to develop the concept of natural selection which is primarily based on explaining how evolution occurs with the mechanism of `natural selection'. Darwin observed in the world about him what he believed to be the result of a single cell organism that had evolved into all forms of life we see today. More importantly, there is no chaos involved. It has order. \\"The Origin of Species\\" (TOOS) is all about Darwin discussing how he came to this conclusion.<br /><br />In the 21st Century, \\"Speciation\\" has been observed countless times. Go search right now for \\"Observed Speciation Events\\".<br /><br />***Speciation is a fact whether we can explain the mechanisms of how it works or not. This can not be understated! A fact is a fact regardless of our ability to explain how it works. Gravity existed well before Newton could explain it. Speciation exists (a new species developing in the world, under scientific observation) meaning evolution is a fact. Look at the title of this review. Nobody should have to explain evolution in order to prove it factual. ***<br /><br />Now is the time to say this. If you don't believe theories are factual, then stop engaging the results of factual science in your life right now. Walk the talk. Turn off the PC. Turn off the electricity. Turn off the heating... and walk. I will allow you the option of a bronze spear... that is if you know how to smelt bronze.<br /><br />As a note, the Catholic Church has been teaching the fact of evolution and the theory of the mechanisms of evolution in Catholic schools since the 1950s. This is exactly the same coursework that secular schools have on evolution. However there is some discrepancy over natural selection. Natural selection has order but it is not guided. This is the problem part for most religious people. One would do well however to experience thinking about natural selection without any divine guidance. This is truly the type of thinking that grasps the full impact of this work.<br /><br />The theory of the mechanisms of evolution is independent of the fact of evolution. The theory of the mechanisms of evolution is a compilation of facts (without gaps) used to explain the fact of evolution. The theory of the mechanisms of evolution is here, in part, but are much better explained and referenced by modern evolutionary biology. If its modern evolution you want (and you may well do if your first search brought you here) then go to talkorigins on the net and read about the \\"29+ evidences for macroevolution\\". It can take days, weeks months, or years, or a lifetime to parse the data, but keep going over it and it will eventually click.<br /><br />The most popular version of The Origin of Species is the one which contains the first edition published by Darwin in 1859 with an editor's introduction by J. W Burrow first published in 1968. Burrows covers the history of the work, the successive editions of the book that Darwin published and recent scientific discoveries that shed light on Darwin's theory.<br /><br />Introduction<br />Darwin in TOOS starts by describing his life and times as a naturalist. Darwin explains the problem of immutable claims about the species and goes through the historical record to show instances where people have indicated that the species are mutable. He explains that he is writing this book because Alfred Russel Wallace has drawn the same conclusions about natural selection.<br /><br />Chapter 1: Variation under Domestication<br />Darwin goes straight into variations under domestication showing that farmed animals are substantially different from their wild counterparts from which they came. Darwin did not have access to Gregor Mendel's laws of inheritance but he did guess that there was a mechanism like this responsible for variation. His bases for the assertion that species come from other closely related species is absolutely fundamentally correct by today's standards. His explanation for it was revolutionary for his time.<br /><br />Chapter 2: Variation under Nature<br />Darwin exposes the instability of the then current system of taxonomy to show that categorization and labelling is not fixed and thus questions the bases for immutability. This paves the way for the natural overview that all like organisms share commonalities and that variations can be immediate or subtle gradual changes over time. Darwin discusses intermediate forms and shows that group changes are proportional while alluding to the first shape of an evolutionary tree.<br /><br />Chapter 3: Struggle for Existence<br />Darwin presents the ecosystem and shows that all organisms struggle to survive and that this struggle influences what we, who have survived this struggle, see in the world today. Darwin shows this complex structure and connects it with such descriptions as the presence of a feline determining through the intervention of mice and then bees the frequency of certain flowers in an area.<br /><br />Chapter 4: Natural Selection<br />This is core material of how highly complex organisms are formed from organisms with lesser complexity and has still stood the test of time today. Darwin not only verifies evolution but explains its mechanism, natural selection. Using the analogy of a tree and the taxonomy of living things Darwin shows how beneficial variations in conjunction with heredity are responsible for the formation of new species gradually over long periods of time which compete and cause extinctions. Darwin establishes the foundation for common descent.<br /><br />Chapter 5: Laws of Variation<br />Darwin, without knowing Mendel's laws of inheritance, comes close to explaining it by in-depth analyses of the variations in organisms, such as the horse and cabbage. Darwin has been preparing the reader to accept that species are highly variable and that this means that ideas of a static independent design of the species without variation are highly flawed and evolution can be the only sensible conclusion drawn from the evidence.<br /><br />Chapter 6: Difficulties on Theory<br />Darwin does what religious writers avoid which is self-critic, the hallmark of scientific thinking, brings up all possible problems with his theory and slowly shows how the answers are natural even though he doesn't have them all yet, but still manages to explain the evolution of the eye by comparison to lesser complex eyes in nature as well as the evolution of flight by comparison to gliding organisms. Darwin then shows imperfections in nature, explains why they are there and pulls off a last minute rationalization for why organisms more suited for another environment live in a completely different one with natural selection.<br /><br />Chapter 7: Instinct<br />Darwin looks at complex instincts in the animal kingdom. Here Darwin examines the life of aphids and ants, revealing their instincts, turns to birds, before going back into the micro world of slave-making ants and the hive-bee, before tackling the design of complex hive honeycomb structures. Not only does Darwin show the evolution of beehives but has all along been preparing us for the slow long gradual evolution of instinct in all living things and then directly implies Mendel's laws of inheritance. Darwin amazingly demonstrates that neuter or sterile insects that perform specific tasks can be produced from parents who don't do those tasks, by way of natural selection.<br /><br />Chapter 8: Hybridism<br />In order to understand this chapter one should know that at the time the sterility of species was considered the divine indication that species where not allowed to crossbreed. Darwin using sterility examples shows the reader that there is very little to distinguish species from varieties, if they can be distinguished at all. This undermines any attempt to say that a species has an exact definition or is fixed and this is fatal to the independent creation of species hypothesis. Darwin establishes yet another proof for evolution.<br /><br />Chapter 9: On the Imperfection of the Geological Record<br />Darwin using Lyell's geology changes our view of the world. Suddenly we find that we are no longer the centre of the earth, just as Copernicus showed that we where no longer the centre of our solar system. Darwin describes geology in-depth, with the erosion of land, atom by atom, and the formation of land, atom by atom, adding that the world has seen many forms of life, gradually evolving, through a vast amount of time that we can barely comprehend. He challenges questions about the limits of the fossil record by revealing the story of life as only evident in some parts, with other parts yet to be found, if they will ever be found at all. It's a breathtaking chapter that reshapes how human beings will see themselves after reading it.<br /><br />Chapter 10: On the Geological Succession of Organic Beings<br />Now that Darwin has completely revised our world view with the evidence of evolution he proceeds to explain how geological movements over long period of time, as well as the migration of species, will create an imperfect fossil record but that this imperfect fossil record will always show organisms of lesser complexity evolving into organisms of greater complexity via the mechanism of natural selection. Darwin shows that species evolve at different rates over time and in different directions which explains the present existing complexity of life today and the scientific record of every organism that has ever lived.<br /><br />Chapter 11: Geographical distribution<br />Darwin describes a series of practical experiments that anyone can do in their own back garden involving picking seeds from bird droppings, germinating them, sinking seeds in water for 28 days, growing them, analysing the content of mud in the paws of trekking animals and then concluding that the geographical dispersal of fauna from island to island is not a mystery. Darwin then explains why similar fauna are found up mountains around the world by way of glaciers pushing and splitting primordial plant life from the ground upwards. These simple explanations are yet another blow to the suggestion of the immutability of species.<br /><br />Chapter 12: Geographical distribution -- continued<br />Without directly saying it, Darwin has been implying the common decent of all biological organisms from a single source, the origin of species. Darwin now says it but continues on the topic of distribution showing how birds can easily spread freshwater organisms and how the geological changes of streams, intersecting and separating, can spread freshwater life across the planet. Darwin joins geology with distribution presenting the historical record for all life on earth. Laws of diversity regarding degrees of complexity are introduced. Darwin has established the structure of evolutionary biology as the explanation for life. The scientific impact is immeasurable.<br /><br />Chapter 13: Mutual Affinities of Organic Beings: Morphology: Embryology: Rudimentary Organs<br />For anyone left unconvinced, for some odd reason or another, Darwin simply points to the current work in the natural system and shows that the underlying theme taxonomists have been searching for is actually common decent. Darwin then demonstrates how natural selection can create similar developments in very diverse organisms. Embryology alone is argued as evidence for common decent as Darwin illustrates that all embryos and newborn virtually look the same in some respect and that growth and aging in the lifetime of any organism is almost enough evidence alone for mutability. Finally Darwin delivers on a collection of useless organs and appendages no longer in use because they have been naturally breed out because of disuse or `inutility'.<br /><br />Chapter 14: Recapitulation and Conclusion<br />Darwin runs through all the main points of his argument for natural selection. Darwin is aware that evolution is a minority view but hopes that in the future more evidence for natural selection will appear. He says he can offer nothing to support the idea of the immutability of species and closes with a profound statement and for the first time invokes and ends with the classic word that defined his view. Darwin says, \\"There is grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that, whilst this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been, and are being, EVOLVED.\\"<br /><br />The complex web of relations with livings things to the environment is staggering yet so obvious in hindsight. The whole point of TOOS is it is ridiculous that someone didn't get this sooner. The environment has an impact of living things and living things have an impact on the environment. This is a symbiotic relationship. There is an opportunity for improvement or deterioration in the offspring just on the basis of all possible genetic combinations. Minor changes add up to big ones.<br /><br />Darwin's findings about how the environment causes variations in living things is accurate in his proposals although his tenders are mostly humanistic with references to biology especially with regards to \\"monstrosities\\" that simply don't have any reason for things like \\"wings\\", such as some insects and some birds, if they can't fly. Vestiges are an extremely good case for evolution. The cave crab with an eye stalk without an eye is like a telescope without the lens. Darwin identifies the possibility of sex linked traits in animals, a proven point today.<br /><br />Reading TOOS is like a romance novel where the birth of something to unify the sciences further is described in a man's love for nature and his crucial discovery. TOOS is something that needs to be reread several times for the full impact. Walking around in the world today knowing that all organisms have evolved from lesser complexity to greater complexity by means of natural selection is a whole different worldview to thinking that a supernatural deity did it.

Challenge yourself. Try it.ling their instincts, turns to birds, before going back into the micro world of slave-making ants and the hive-bee, before tackling the design of complex hive honeycomb structures. Not only does Darwin show the evolution of beehives but has all along been preparing us for the slow long gradual evolution of instinct in all living things and then directly implies Mendel's laws of inheritance. Darwin amazingly demonstrates that neuter or sterile insects that perform specific tasks can be produced from parents who don't do those tasks, by way of natural selection.    Chapter 8: Hybridism  In order to understand this chapter one should know that at the time the sterility of species was considered the divine indication that species where not allowed to crossbreed. Darwin using sterility examples shows the reader that there is very little to distinguish species from varieties, if they can be distinguished at all. This undermines any attempt to say that a species has an exact definition or is fixed and this is fatal to the independent creation of species hypothesis. Darwin establishes yet another proof for evolution.    Chapter 9: On the Imperfection of the Geological Record   Darwin using Lyell's geology changes our view of the world. Suddenly we find that we are no longer the centre of the earth, just as Copernicus showed that we where no longer the centre of our solar system. Darwin describes geology in-depth, with the erosion of land, atom by atom, and the formation of land, atom by atom, adding that the world has seen many forms of life, gradually evolving, through a vast amount of time that we can barely comprehend. He challenges questions about the limits of the fossil record by revealing the story of life as only evident in some parts, with other parts yet to be found, if they will ever be found at all. It's a breathtaking chapter that reshapes how human beings will see themselves after reading it.    Chapter 10: On the Geological Succession of Organic Beings  Now that Darwin has completely revised our world view with the evidence of evolution he proceeds to explain how geological movements over long period of time, as well as the migration of species, will create an imperfect fossil record but that this imperfect fossil record will always show organisms of lesser complexity evolving into organisms of greater complexity via the mechanism of natural selection. Darwin shows that species evolve at different rates over time and in different directions which explains the present existing complexity of life today and the scientific record of every organism that has ever lived.    Chapter 11: Geographical distribution  Darwin describes a series of practical experiments that anyone can do in their own back garden involving picking seeds from bird droppings, germinating them, sinking seeds in water for 28 days, growing them, analysing the content of mud in the paws of trekking animals and then concluding that the geographical dispersal of fauna from island to island is not a mystery. Darwin then explains why similar fauna are found up mountains around the world by way of glaciers pushing and splitting primordial plant life from the ground upwards. These simple explanations are yet another blow to the suggestion of the immutability of species.     Chapter 12: Geographical distribution -- continued  Without directly saying it, Darwin has been implying the common decent of all biological organisms from a single source, the origin of species. Darwin now says it but continues on the topic of distribution showing how birds can easily spread freshwater organisms and how the geological changes of streams, intersecting and separating, can spread freshwater life across the planet. Darwin joins geology with distribution presenting the historical record for all life on earth. Laws of diversity regarding degrees of complexity are introduced. Darwin has established the structure of evolutionary biology as the explanation for life. The scientific impact is immeasurable.    Chapter 13: Mutual Affinities of Organic Beings: Morphology: Embryology: Rudimentary Organs  For anyone left unconvinced, for some odd reason or another, Darwin simply points to the current work in the natural system and shows that the underlying theme taxonomists have been searching for is actually common decent. Darwin then demonstrates how natural selection can create similar developments in very diverse organisms. Embryology alone is argued as evidence for common decent as Darwin illustrates that all embryos and newborn virtually look the same in some respect and that growth and aging in the lifetime of any organism is almost enough evidence alone for mutability. Finally Darwin delivers on a collection of useless organs and appendages no longer in use because they have been naturally breed out because of disuse or `inutility'.    Chapter 14: Recapitulation and Conclusion  Darwin runs through all the main points of his argument for natural selection. Darwin is aware that evolution is a minority view but hopes that in the future more evidence for natural selection will appear. He says he can offer nothing to support the idea of the immutability of species and closes with a profound statement and for the first time invokes and ends with the classic word that defined his view.

B000KRN07S|5.0|Like her 2004 sophomore effort, \\"Feels Like Home,\\" Norah Jones' latest maintains the sound that brought her national acclaim while still furthering her artistic endeavors.<br /><br />\\"Not Too Late\\" proves she is not given to relying on a cash- cow formula; she not only continues to add inflections of country like last time around, but she eschews the American songbook in favor of a uniformly original array of songs -- all of which she co-wrote. This aids the record's warm, intimate atmosphere, which glimmers and glows despite the absence of the late legendary producer, Arif Mardin.<br /><br />The slinky blues of \\"Thinking About You\\" is the ideal lead single. With its plaintive melody, organic jazz horns and restrained yet expressive vocals, it is musical chocolate cake. \\"Sinkin' Soon,\\" meanwhile, is the most perplexing track. With its curious lyrics (\\"Like the oyster crack in the stew/The honey in the tea/Like the wheel of cheese high in the sky/We're gonna be sinkin' soon), the song sways and jerks with Jesse Harris (writer of her monster hit \\"Don't Know Why\\") on banjo and drummer Andy Borger working pots and pans. It continues the theme of fame's fickle nature that began with \\"Carnival Town\\" on her last LP.<br /><br />In spite of her popularity with white collar right-wingers, Jones is not afraid to infuse her music with passionate liberal beliefs. With its lush, nervous mix of pianos and guitars, \\"Wish I Could\\" is the story of a lonely war widow and even lonelier other woman (\\"She says love in the time of war's not fair/He was my man but they didn't care/I don't tell her that I once loved you too\\"), while \\"Broken\\" finds a soldier irrevocably hardened by war (\\"He's got blood on his shoes and mud on his brim/Did he do it to himself or was it done to him?\\").<br /><br />\\"My Dear Country,\\" with a cabaretlike interlude, waxes on a terrifying election and a \\"deranged\\" politician without naming names:<br /><br />\\"I cherish you my dear country/I love all the things that you've given me/And most of all that I am free/To have a song that I can sing/On election day.\\"<br /><br />The soothing \\"Wake Me Up\\" appropriately follows with its resigned, world-weary attitude, bringing in sounds of the heartland that continue in \\"Rosie's Lullaby\\" and the fun-loving \\"Be My Somebody,\\" the latter marked by cheeky lyrics: \\"Last night was a record to be broken/It broke all over the kitchen floor.\\"<br /><br />\\"Little Room\\" attempts to shed her fuddy-duddy image with sexual undertones, while \\"Not My Friend\\" finds her safe in her own company -- not content to maintain a relationship with someone who wishes her unhappiness.<br /><br />\\"The Sun Doesn't Like You\\" and \\"Until the End\\" are full of grace and character, and \\"Not Too Late\\" closes the disc with spare piano/vocal simplicity. Its optimistic message provides a perfect conclusion and its overwhelmingly pristine melody makes it an instant classic.<br /><br />If \\"Come Away With Me\\" was rich, delicious comfort food, \\"Not Too Late\\" is more complex and sophisticated. Making artistic leaps and bounds, Jones proves that she is not a Grammy guzzler laughing all the way to the bank -- she is an artist's artist.<br /><br />This limited-edition version contains a DVD jam-packed with goodies, most notably the eye-popping video for \\"Sinkin' Soon,\\" while iTunes has an exclusive alternate version of the aforementioned track available.ngs that you've given me/And most of all that I am free/To have a song that I can sing/On election day.\\" <br /> <br />The soothing \\"Wake Me Up\\" appropriately follows with its resigned, world-weary attitude, bringing in sounds of the heartland that continue in \\"Rosie's Lullaby\\" and the fun-loving \\"Be My Somebody,\\" the latter marked by cheeky lyrics: \\"Last night was a record to be broken/It broke all over the kitchen floor.\\" <br /> <br />\\"Little Room\\" attempts to shed her fuddy-duddy image with sexual undertones, while \\"Not My Friend\\" finds her safe in her own company -- not content to maintain a relationship with someone who wishes her unhappiness. <br /> <br />\\"The Sun Doesn't Like You\\" and \\"Until the End\\" are full of grace and character, and \\"Not Too Late\\" closes the disc with spare piano/vocal simplicity.

0553582453|5.0|Hobb continues to impress in this 2nd book of the Tawny Man trilogy.  Intricate plot lines keep you thinking, guessing, and reading.  You'll fall in love with these characters and agonize over their problems and mistakes.  Robin Hobb can bring a story to life like a true master and I'd consider her to be one of the very best authors out there.<br /><br />Golden Fool brings together the first two Hobb trilogies, with Bingtown traders coming to Buckkeep to petition for aid against Chalced and revealing the rebirth of true dragons to the world.  Mysteries about the Farseer trilogy are further explained here, principally about the nature of the Six Duchies dragons and the Elderlings.  Additionally, the nature of the Fool is further revealed, and his ties to the White Lady and opposing destinies adds to the wonder of the tale.<br /><br />In this book, Fitz, Dutiful and co. are all at Buckkeep, working to prepare for the future.  Court intrigue and diplomacy replace the breakneck action from the first book.  Negotiations with delegations from the Out Islands, Bingtown, and the Old Blood take up the majority of the book, each adding its own element of mystery to an increasingly complex (and beautiful) plot.  As Tom Badgerlock, Fitz is kept busy as Lord Golden's bodyguard as well as secretly training the prince and Thick in the Skill, while being distressed by his daughter Nettle and an even stranger voice (whom you suspect to be Tintaglia the dragon).  As a part-time spy for Chade, Fitz observes a number of puzzling things, including the intricate (and painful) tattoo on the Narcheska's back.  As usual, distrust runs rampant through Buckkeep, with friends keeping too many secrets from one another.  The reader gets the feeling that many mysteries could be solved with a little better communication between Fitz and his comrades.<br /><br />The book ends on a high note, with all of the companions safe and together and the prince about to journey to the Out Islands on what will surely be a monumental quest.  Many questions and mysteries are left for the final book in the series, and I'm sure that it will be terrific.t will surely be a monumental quest.

B000LC55F2|5.0|The movie contains many great lessons, magic and great performances by all the actors.  <br /> <br />The real life Nikola Tesla was a true magician. He never married, spent every waking moment studying electricity. I can recommend this film. It is a drama.
0345409671|1.0|I wanted to read all of the Vampire Chronicles, so I read this one and I have to say I was very disappointed!  I never would have imagined I would find an Anne Rice book that I did not like.  I have always enjoyed her writing, but this book was so slow and I had a very difficult time staying interested.  Maybe this is due partly to the fact that I do NOT believe in a literal heaven and hell.  These are simply not a part of my spiritual beliefs.  This book seemed extremely heavy on Catholicism.  Even though that has always been a part of the back drop to Anne Rice's books, I was always able to accept that or overlook it.  This book, unfortunately, is like one long \\"fire & brimstone\\" sermon, in my opinion and I can do without that.  If I wanted that I'd be reading something other than vampire stories.
B000002OTL|4.0|PULP FICTION is a movie replete with coarse language and violence. The soundtrack album accurately reflects that film. In particular, on track #1, Honey Bunny's exclamation prior to \\"Misrilou\\" is not for the faint of heart. Be advised that this CD is definitely NOT for the easily-offended.<br /><br />The PULP FICTION soundtrack is a unique mix of primarily surf music, with a sprinkling of soul, pop and country. If you enjoyed the movie, this album is sure to please. Just don't play it for your grandmother!

B000MTOKY6|5.0|The word I got on this is that it's a \\"deluxe\\" package, but has not been remastered since the last edition was released.  No bonus material, \\"Dlx\\" is Deluxe, but I haven't figured out what \\"Mlps\\" is.
0307383415|5.0|Barack's Dreams From My Father is most compelling. It takes you through his early years to adulthood...and throughout you're able to follow his thought processes and feelings.  While his search for self identity and place are key areas of dicussion, there is also the realization that that identity is in context with all of humanity.  The book is passionate, funny at times and reveals Barack's keen ability to analize, understand and reach reasonable conclusions...fair to all.  His journey, while different from most journeys, is not uncommon to many, as you attempt to discover one's self and purpose in this world. It's a terrific page turner, candid and thoroughly enjoyable.  W. Best
0307237699|5.0|The book is a fun read! Because Barack Obama is running for President and is NOT a WASP (white, Anglo-Saxon Protestant) like me, I wanted to know just who he was.  The book gave me an entertaining and informative answer.  The scope of the book is much wider than the facts of his life.  His view of United States history and economics and his view of the world are part of the picture given.  In my opinion, Mr. Obama emerged as a man well qualified to lead our nation.  He has the character-he spent his youth working for the disadvantaged of Chicago; the brains- he's an outstanding, award-winning scholar; the understanding of the world OUTSIDE the U.S.A.-his father is from Africa, and he spent his elementary school years in Indonesia; and the personal charisma that we need in our leader.  Before reading the book I had thought it would be wonderful to show the hostile, international community what a humane and inclusive country we are by electing a BLACK president with the middle name of Hussein.  Now I know I can support his candidacy with complete confidence.

1582701709|5.0|Even if people don't believe fortunes will fall on their heads after reading this book, I feel people NEED to read it. It is uplifting to a sad depressed soul. It tries to teach self value which is lacking in so many of us. If you aren't sad or depressed, it still teaches you or reminds you to stop  and rewind that out of control overwhelming feeling to succeed every day (you are already successful when you count your blessings and more success will follow when you are grateful for what success you already have).  I have felt a \\"natural high\\" since I read it and when it starts to wear off, I opened the book up and have another dose. I feel it is pretty much what I believe our Lord would wants us to feel like everyday.
B000FIMG68|5.0|Delivered promptly. I got it a couple days after it was released and it was in great condition.
055358202X|2.0|I feel ripped off!!    I just re-read 3 books to enjoy #4 - and all I got was 3 1/2!!  I read other series (like Jordan and Goodkin) - there are better ways to end a book; everything is hanging and now I will wait 2 years for the next installment. And that will not even continue what this book started - so 4 years to find out about Arya and Brienne?!?!    I have already downgraded from hard-covered to paperback. Now I will downgrade till the story finishes.    GREAT STORY - UNPROFESSIONAL EDITING - UNFAIR TO THE READERS!!.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|After waiting for almost 20 years for this beauty to be remastered, I finally bought this a couple of weeks ago.  I remember thinking to myself how amazing it is that Brad Delp did all the vocals himself (truly an underrated vocalist, who should be mentioned with the greats).  Thus, it was doubly sad to read about his passing last week.  Thankfully, Tom Scholz remastered this magnum opus so that future generations could revel in the amazing sounds coming out of the speakers.  I may have blown out the speakers in my car listening to this baby as it should be, but it's worth every penny you can pay for it, and more.  Even after all these years, I still get goosebumps listening to the final riff in \\"Long Time.\\"  Rest in peace Brad, and know that your voice will linger on.
0375701427|5.0|This is an amazing book which for me worked powerfully on several levels - first, the characters are beautifully drawn, fleshed out to accompany and in some instances haunt us beyond the reading of the book.  Next, Philip Roth evokes Newark of the second world war and follows it through its sad decline and the turmoil of the sixties and seventies with a thoroughly convincing sense of time and place.  Finally, he answers a question which remains timely - where is it after all that terrorists come from?  And the deeply disturbing answer is that they may very well come from characters we come to understand and care about.  This is a book for the ages and I'm so glad I read it.
B000NMW6M0|2.0|Was very disappointed to realize that on my Tivo (series 3, but I don't think it matters) I got the 4:3 version.  NOT the widescreen version.   <br /> <br />So of course it displays \\"windowboxed\\" instead of full screen.  Yeah, i can ZOOM the tv display but this degrades even further the image quality.  Not very pretty in the end. <br /> <br />Is this going to be the case for all Tivo downloads? <br /> <br />
1416905014|5.0|We had seen this book at a children's boutique, but ordered it through Amazon for much less.  The details in the pop-ups are amazing!  Not only is there the \\"main\\" pop-up on each page, but there is also a smaller pop-up on each side of the pages.  The pop-up of Cinderella's dress includes ribbons and all!  My soon-to-be eight yr. old daughter is entranced by this book.  It might not be suitable for the younger ones, though, as it is quite delicate.  Just the same, I bought another copy for my niece's upcoming 5th birthday.....

B001EAWME2|5.0|&#34;Black Christmas&#34; Is hands down one of  the most original horror movies ever made.<br /><br />Certainly the birth of the sorority slasher. They didn't have to rely on gore to scare or shock you.<br /><br />The voice of the phantom caller was enough to make your skin crawl and the character of Billy was so frighteningly genius That just a look at one  eye leering through a peep hole freaked me out for weeks. As much as I loved &#34;When A Stranger Calls and Halloween, I must say this movie paved the way for them both and many a film to come,&#34;Sorority girls being killed&#34;, a fortune has been made off of that premise alone. Kudos to this piece of horror genius and slasher royalty.
B000GIXIBY|4.0|Until now, the better print that i have of this movie was the Anchor Bay dvd release. <br />But this hd dvd surpases it so much. The quality picture is amazing, and the sound is quite good too. Pitty that Universal only put the movie on the record, and no extras at all. But anyway, I have them on the other release. <br />
B000MNP2KI|4.0|Like many other people when I saw who was going to take over the role of James Bond I was very disappointed but after the movie I had changed my mind.  Daniel Craig is a great Bond.  The movie is filled with great action scenes.  I only gave the movie four stars because I don't understand why they had to remake an old Bond movie.  They should have came up with a new idea since it is a new James Bond.  Overall the movie is great.
B000E994KE|5.0|because bands like Amorphis go completely under the radar. Randomly one day I was actually on myspace browsing some music and ran across this band and listened to \\"brother moon\\" and it blew me away. Great instrumentation, mixture of vocal stylings, it had it all. Then I purchased this CD and the whole thing is good. This band is classified as death metal by some, but they really aren't. On occasion they have growls but topically it has nothing to do with it and the instrumentation is far beyond that of other death metal bands. Yes, from what I hear they used to be like that but they've always been musically different. I would probably classify them in the progressive category like Dream Theater, except at times rougher and definitely shorter songs. Great buy though. My only complaint is the bonus track but I'm not going to dock off points just because of that.
B000JBWWRY|4.0|Like many other thousands of people I am a huge fan of Disney animated classics so I am very happy that this edition of Peter Pan is available.  I always had a very active imagination as a kid and it kind of dwindled away as the years rolled on by so it is always enjoyable to watch this movie and think of never growing up.  The story is so fun and magical.  Now a little down side to this movie is I don't want my kids to try to fly out a window!!!  Do you think Michael Jackson is trying to have the face of Peter Pan it really does look like him with the large eyes and very small nose?
B00005JPLU|5.0|300 is the film adaptation of the graphic novel by Frank Miller and is partly based on the true story of 300 Spartans led by their king Leonidas (Gerard Butler) who set out to hold off an invading Persian army easily 100 times their size.<br /><br />This film is nothing short of spectacular!! The first must-see film of 2007. If you're familiar with Miller's graphic novel, you'll see that director Zack Snyder (Dawn of the Dead remake and who's slated to direct an adaptation of Alan Moore's Watchmen) rendered it very faithfully, similar to the way Robert Rodriguez did for Miller's Sin City, often adapting panel per panel on screen. I'd even go so far to say that this is the best gladiator film I've ever seen.<br /><br />Leonidas's character is one that I would follow to the ends of the earth; Butler was perfectly cast in the role as the kind king to his people but ruthless against his enemy. The cool visuals, the Spartans' unstoppable onslaught against the Persians, the booming score; this film is just awesome. See it on the big screen while you can, you won't be disappointed! Can't wait for a DVD release...
B00006ADD5|5.0|Excellent film.  Of course, any David Lean movie has the scope that put almost every other film to shame.  The story, the cast, and of course, the direction are without peer.  Thank you Amazon for making this film available.
B000BKVQTS|4.0|For those looking for a fantasy fix on the level of Lord of The Rings, this film delivers. In fact the reality elements of the story make the fantasy all the more frightening. These were good roles for the leads and all the supporting players were great. This film is neither biography nor a Grimm fairy tale. Rather you get the story of the storytellers dropped into the midst of an adventure that proves more real than they ever thought possible.
B000AYEL1A|5.0|Received it very fast and very happy with the DVD. Well worth the money.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|This is a tremendous CD which I whole-heartedly recommend. Neil Young announces before the fourth song that he will be playing \\"mostly new songs tonight.\\" Five of the new songs would appear on the following year's \\"Harvest\\" album, which for my money, is Neil Young's finest. Did the audience realize just how extraordinary was this batch of new songs? Did Neil himself have any inkling of the phenomenal acclaim and acceptance \\"Harvest\\" would receive?    The songs are all performed solo by Neil, twelve on guitar, six (counting track 7 as two) on piano. (Unplugged, if you will, decades before that term was coined and turned into a marketing tool.)    One of the most interesting piano tracks is \\"A Man Needs a Maid/Heart of Gold.\\" Neil introduces the song by saying \\"some people look at their life and say, well, my life is like a movie,\\" then jokes that \\"this is like a showtune from my movie,\\" perhaps foreshadowing the heavy production \\"A Man Needs a Maid\\" would receive on the studio album. However, the spare rendering here is superior, in my opinion. Then midway through the track, Neil segues into a stark version of \\"Heart of Gold,\\" previewing what can arguably be called his definitive song.    Standout tracks with acoustic guitar include \\"Old Man,\\" \\"Needle and the Damage Done,\\" \\"Cowgirl In The Sand,\\" and \\"Ohio.\\" But one could as easily point out highlights by repeating the entire track list. Guitarists especially will appreciate how the songs are played in this solo acoustic format.  The sound quality of the recording is superb.    There are several new (at the time) songs that didn't wind up on Harvest or any other album. Of particular note is \\"Dance, Dance, Dance.\\" In the verse you will recognize the seeds of a later more well-known song.    That Neil has remained relevant all these years -- from CSN&Y to Harvest to Rust Never Sleeps to the Pearl Jam collaborations to last year's \\"Living With War\\" -- makes this CD much more than a nostalgic look at the past. I highly recommend it.
B00005JPLU|2.0|300 (Zack Snyder, 2007)<br /><br />Dear Zack (may I call you Zack? Thank you.),<br /><br />Let me start off by saying that while I wasn't absolutely thrilled with the Dawn of the Dead remake, I did like it. So I was not one of those who greeted the news that you'd be directing the adaptation of Frank Miller's awe-inspiring graphic novel 300 with a groan. Then I started hearing \\"frame-for-frame\\", and I got even more excited. I figured we were in for something fantastic. And halfway through 300, I was wondering whether it would be ludicrous to proclaim a movie as the best of the year when there are still nine months of it left. Nine months or no, an hour into this movie, I knew I was in the presence of greatness.<br /><br />An hour later, I walked out of the theater more bitterly disappointed than I have been with a movie in recent memory. How did something so great become so bad so fast?<br /><br />Let's not let it be said that I don't give credit where credit is due. The majority of this movie is fantastic. Save Gerard Butler's overacting, of course, but I was prepared for that thanks to the trailers. And the parts where you stuck to the novel? Perfect. A lot of the ideas that were extended also worked. The overly-stylized violence that's got some folks in an uproar worked for me; after all, the idea of this battle is larger than life, and making the violence larger than life, as well, seemed an obvious choice. You probably could've saved yourself a million or two by not overusing the annoying bullet-time, but that's a minor quibble at best. When you kept the movie on the battlefield, it was great.<br /><br />The introduction of the \\"meanwhile, back at the ranch...\\" plot halfway through did seem as if it were going to work for a while; despite its consistent throwing off of the pace of the novel's final two chapters (the battle itself), the characters and the intrigue seemed to be consistent with what we'd seen before. You did, however, take it a bit too far in its climax. A bit? Okay, a lot. But that, too, is kind of minor. More important is the fact that the entire development-of-Stelios'-character subplot seems to have been sacrificed for this; without us seeing Stelios go from Stumblios the flunky on the first page of the book to Hero of Thermopylae, we find ourselves wondering why he was the guy who got all the glory. For being a wiseacre? Hardly, but that's the way it looks here. Again, though, minor.<br /><br />The first thing that really got to me was your treatment of Xerxes' immortals. (Fabulous voice effects on Xerxes, however.) Was it really necessary to use your extra makeup budget from Dawn of the Dead turning the immortals into non-humans, and thus sacrificing all the willing suspension of disbelief you'd worked up in your audience? Then came Ubermortal, and, well, you blew it. Hasn't watching the Sci-Fi Channel and Greg Dark movies taught you anything? Professional wrestlers do not belong in serious film. Especially when that film is based on something that really happened (unless, of course, it's a pro wrestler biopic).<br /><br />Then, hot on the heels of \\"hey, let's throw in some demons!\\", we cut to the big scene with Ephialtes. And... um... Baphomet himself playing a bloody lute? Where did that come from? I spent the rest of the night trying to figure out the answer to that question. I'm sure it does have an answer, and that answer in some way involves making the Persian hordes more evil than they actually are-- but man, let's take a look at the way that message fits in with everything else in that scene, and let's examine (a) the way Frank Miller equates sensuality with evil in the graphic novel-- where the only overt attack on sensuality is in the Ephors' Oracle, and that speaks to Leonidas' character more than anything, and (b) the way you equate sensuality with evil not only with the Oracle, but in the Ephialtes/Xerxes scene. (You do know that Baphomet is a symbol for knowledge, yes?) Given that, is there any particular reason that the end credits had to point out that three of the pleasure girls in that scene were transsexuals? Any particular reason for the lingering close-up of a girl-on-girl kiss? One might, upon reflection, find the scene almost reactionary. (One might also start considering these ludicrous claims equating Xerxes to George W. and Leonidas to, well, whoever's running Iraq these days as not so ludicrous.) That one scene did a great deal to blow the movie for me. It's what had me so mad when the movie was over. But that wasn't the movie's greatest crime.<br /><br />It's what you did to Leonidas (whose name, by the way, seems like it should have been pronounced with the \\"i\\" sounding like \\"machine\\" and not \\"Tiber\\"-- but I took Latin, not Greek, and thus might be wrong) that has me thinking you should be strung up in the public square and caned.<br /><br />I'll pause here long enough to note the attack-on-sensuality theme coupled with the injection of a scene of Leonidas and Gorgo making love, smile a bit sadly, and move on. Other than that one scene (which didn't bug me in the least when I first saw it, despite it being the first major deviation from the original text-- of course, I had no idea what you were setting us up for later at the time), as I've mentioned before, the first half of the movie conforms amazingly well to the first six chapters of the novel. And one of the things those first six chapters do is pound the fact into our heads, over and over again, that Spartans have achieved their legendary military might because they're hard. They're not koalas. They know what to do with their sharp claws! You even keep in that bit of Dilios' voiceover after Gorgo delivers one of my favorite lines in the novel: \\"Spartan! Come back with your shield... or on it.\\" Dilios goes out of his way to tell us that there's no room for softness there. And you went out of your way to keep that line. The whole \\"here, take my necklace bit\\" seemed to kind of undermine it, but again, that seemed-- at the time, anyway-- a minor change.<br /><br />And we merrily go on our way for a while, and everyone fights, and blood flies, and the Spartans build the wall, and we get to the climax, and Leonidas... folds like a cheap roadmap. He might as well have been the romantic lead in a Nora Ephron movie. What was up with that? I've heard people complain a lot about \\"gratuitous\\" sex and \\"gratuitous\\" violence in movies. Well, here's one for you-- gratuitous sentimentality! What were you thinking? You spend an hour of film setting up the idea that Spartans are not koalas. You spend another forty minutes or so showing us that Spartans are not koalas. And then you give us the big climax and the King of the Spartans turns into a little tree-climer. Ugh.<br /><br />Other than that, Mrs. Lincoln, how did you like the play?<br /><br />Sincerely,<br /><br />Your Favorite Goat.<br /><br />**n that, is there any particular reason that the end credits had to point out that three of the pleasure girls in that scene were transsexuals?

B000LY5QQS|5.0|Pierce Brosnan returned in 1997 for his second appearance as James Bond in the 18th official Bond film.  Pierce appeared to me to be somewhat uncertain at points in \\"Goldeneye,\\" but in \\"Tomorrow Never Dies\\" Brosnan comfortably took on character of James Bond.  Double entendres were provided not only by Bond, but by M and Miss Moneypenny.  Female characters took the lead throughout the film, with Bond accepting the assistance of a female comparable to him.  The villain was truly wonderful and sinister in the grand tradition of Bond villains, and the gadgets were the best yet.<br /><br />We meet Bond at the beginning of this film doing what he does best, getting in trouble.  He is spying on a gathering of merchants selling military merchandise of various types and lethality, including nuclear weapons.  Watch this scene carefully as there is an important person at this gathering buying a rather benign looking device.  Unfortunately a shoot first ask intelligent questions kind of person ordered a cruise missile launched at the gathering before realizing there was nuclear weapons.  Bond is required to think fast to save himself and those who might be exposed to the nuclear fall out.  Bond comes through in spectacular fashion to open yet another James Bond movie.<br /><br />After Cheryl Crow sings the opening credits we see the H.M.S. Devonshire cruising in the South China Sea.  We also see a stealth ship launch a weapon at the Devonshire and at passing Chinese MIGs with the intent of building tension between China and Great Britain.  The man behind the stealth ship is media magnate Elliot Carver, chillingly played by the Jonathan Pryce (\\"Pirates of the Caribbean,\\" \\"Evita,\\" \\"Something Wicked this Way Comes\\" and numerous others), who makes being sinister into a fine art.  Carver has a nice simple goal: make news and be first to report it through the Carver Media Group Network (CMGN).  His master plan is to start a war between China and Britain to coincide with the launch of a new satellite news network.  Unfortunately for Carver, James Bond thinks a war with Great Britain is an awful idea.<br /><br />We soon meet an interesting cast of characters.  Teri Hatcher is Paris Carver, Elliot's wife and a former Bond love interest.  One of Paris's best lines is, \\"Tell me James.  Do you still sleep with a gun beneath your pillow?\\"  In many ways Paris reminds me of Andrea Anders (Maud Adams) in \\"The Man with a Golden Gun\\" because Paris also appears to have been caught in something much bigger than her, and to some extent she knows she is doomed.<br /><br />Michelle Yeoh is Wai Lin, a Chinese agent who is a counterpart of James Bond, and just as effective.  I enjoyed watching as Wai Lin and Bond treated each other with disdain and then slowly realized that they were more effective as a team.  Though Wai Lin does not have an equivalent of Q (Desmond Llewelyn), she does have a secret hideout with just as many interesting toys as Q usually has.<br /><br />Most of the best scenes in the movie involve Bond and Wai Lin, including an escape from a high rise, a leisurely motorcycle ride in Viet Nam, and a pleasurable cruise on a stealth ship.  The motorcycle ride is excellent.  The moment of surprise when Bond and Wai Lin both try to ride the motorcycle is real.  Both actors thought they were supposed to drive the motorcycle.<br /><br />I keep wondering when the creativity of the Bond series might begin to falter.  It has not with this film, which grossed slightly less than \\"Goldeneye\\" worldwide.  The ideas continued to flow and the plot is sufficiently convoluted to make watching the movie fun without losing the audience.  The acting is wonderful throughout, with one of the greatest Bond casts ever.  I will admit to being surprised when Miss Moneypenny told Bond that he was always a \\"cunning linguist.\\"  I would have thought that particular pun would not have made it past the censors.<br /><br />I am usually lukewarm to DVD extras, but I was impressedwith those on this DVD.  The two audio commentaries contained interesting and relevant information.  However, one is very good and the other is weak.  The \\"Secrets of 007\\" is a wonderful feature detailing the history of the series.  There are many more features, including music videos and deleted scenes, all fun to watch.<br /><br />Sean Connery will likely always be the definitive Bond for a variety of reasons.  However, this excellent movie, which won six significant awards worldwide and was nominated for six more, firmly established Pierce Brosnan as the second best Bond.  If you are a Bond movie fan or a Pierce Brosnan fan, or Jonathan Pryce or Judi Dench, this film is a perfect addition to your collection.<br /><br />Enjoy!ained interesting and relevant information.

B00005R24G|4.0|Sleuth (Joseph Mankiewicz, 1973)<br /><br />Anthony Shaffer is a guy who knows how to think things through. He creates labyrinthine plots, and then throws interesting characters into them. While I'd argue with anyone who contests that the finest adaptation of a Shaffer work to the screen is Robin Hardy's immortal The Wicker Man, Sleuth is certainly not far behind.<br /><br />Andrew Wyke (Sir Laurence Olivier) is a man who is, perhaps, overly fond of games. He invites Milo Tindle (Michael Caine) to his estate one evening for a bit of game-playing. You see, Wyke is fully aware that Tindle is the lover of his wife Marguerite (Eve Channing, who bears a striking resemblance to Joanne Woodward). He sets forth a rather interesting proposition: he wants Marguerite off his hands, and Milo's in need of a bit of cash, so why not have Milo rob the house? After all, Wyke can claim the theft on insurance. It's a win-win situation. Milo, however, becomes increasingly aware as time goes on that not all is what it seems...<br /><br />The movie was nominated for four Oscars (Best Actor for both Caine and Olivier, Best Score, and Best Director) and four BAFTAs (Best Actor for Olivier, Screenplay, Art Direction, and Cinematography for Oswal Morris, who'd won the Oscar the year previous for A Fiddler on the Roof). It managed to get through both awards presentations with a complete snubbing, but that's in no small part because it ran into a roomful of chainsaws that year (The Godfather, Truffaut's Day for Night, La Charme Discret de la Bourgeoisie, and Cabaret, all entries on many, many 100-best lists over the years, were some of the films that snatched awards away from Sleuth). That it managed to snatch such defeat from the jaws of victory is more than anything a measure of how strong the film community was at the time; when was the last time you saw Oscars and BAFTAs with that kind of a roster competing for awards? Sleuth may have managed to finish second, but Sham finished second to Secretariat, too. Sham still ran the second-fastest Kentucky Derby ever recorded.<br /><br />Sleuth is a wonderful movie. It's wickedly funny, sports incredible performances from its two top dogs, and (even if you see through the rather obvious bat-and-switch halfway through the movie immediately) will keep you guessing right up till the end. A cracking mystery, wot? ****d to Secretariat, too. Sham still ran the second-fastest Kentucky Derby ever recorded. <br /> <br />Sleuth is a wonderful movie.

B000LY4KWO|5.0|James Bond changed for a fifth time with this, the 17th official Bond film, emulating the venerable Dr. Who once again.  Fans welcomed the change from Timothy Dalton to Pierce Brosnan, and they vaulted this movie to the highest grossing Bond movie at that time.  Brosnan made Bond more suave and sophisticated than Dalton's Bond, with a dash more humor, though less humor than Roger Moore's Bond.  It helped that this movie featured non-stop action and a foe with malice toward England in his heart, and the ability to execute a nefarious plot.<br /><br />In the opening scenes of this movie we see a breath-taking stunt, as Bond, well his double actually, leaps off the side of a dam on a bungee cord.  Bond is penetrating a secret Soviet chemical weapons facility.  We learn that Bond is on this mission with Alec Trevelyan, Agent 006 (Sean Bean).  Unfortunately it appears that Alec does not survive an encounter with General Arkady Ourumov (Gottfried John).  After a daring escape involving multiple close calls, the movie forwards into the present to the Mediterranean.<br /><br />Bond encounters Xenia Onatopp (Famke Janssen), and she is behaving in a most unusual fashion.  Of course, Bond may have been attracted to her because of her incredible beauty, but regardless of the reason, she has gained Bond's interest.  We soon observe that Xenia is a most cruel person, and she is ruthless in stealing a super secret helicopter that is resistance to electromagnetic pulses, such as a nuclear weapon might cause.<br /><br />We now move to Severnaya, Russia, where the helicopter has been spotted by satellite.  We have the benefit of going into Severnaya as General Ourumov and sadistic sidekick Onatopp enter the facility and demand an inspection of the Goldeneye system.  It seems that during the cold war the Soviet Union had developed an electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapon, Goldeneye, which was capable of wreaking all sorts of havoc on any electronic equipment in the weapon's aim.  Unfortunately for the personnel of Severnaya, once General Ourumov obtains the control module he has Xenia eliminate the staff of Severnaya.  However, one member of the staff, Natalya Simonova (Izabella Scorupco), has survived Xenia and the activation of the first of two Goldeneye satellites.<br /><br />M (Judi Dench) sends Bond to Russia to find out what is going on.  Bond soon meets with former foe Valentin Zukovsky (Robbie Coltrane), who gives him some clues that might lead Bond to the information he seeks.  As a side note, Minnie Driver has a brief role as Irina, Zukovsky's tone deaf mistress.<br /><br />While Bond has been tracking down Ourumov, Natalya has been tracking former Severnaya associate Boris Grishenko (Alan Cumming).  After a surprised Bond encounters Alec, he awakes to the yells of Natalya, and quickly learns that they are in the cockpit of super secret helicopter, and missiles have been programmed to fire and destroy the helicopter.  After a typically close call, Bond and Natalya soon end up in the hands of Ourumov and Alec once again.  The ever-resourceful Bond escapes, of course, in one of the best chase scenes of all time.<br /><br />The action speeds onward to a hidden satellite dish, which looks remarkably like the observatory at Arecibo, Puerto Rico.  Okay, I am kidding, it really is Arecibo, except when it is a model.  The action intensifies toward the exciting conclusion that takes place under, around and on the huge radio telescope facility.<br /><br />This Bond movie is as good as you might think it is.  We hungered for a new Bond film in the six years between the release of \\"License to Kill\\" in 1989, and the release of this film in 1995.  The world had changed a lot in that time.  The Soviet Union was gone, and the nature of Bond villains changed as well.  As a point of trivia, this Bond marked the first time a Bond movie actually filmed in the former Soviet Union.<br /><br />You can tell the style of this movie a little by the nomination forSaturn Awards this movie received for Best Action/Adventure Film  and Best Actor by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films (USA).  The movie was nominated for a couple of other awards, and won a BMI award for music and a Golden Screen award (Germany).<br /><br />Pierce Brosnan occasionally looks slightly uncomfortable as Bond, but he quickly makes Bond his own.  By the end of the movie I was comfortable that Brosnan made a suitable James Bond, and was already looking forward to the next Bond film.  I recommend this movie highly to fans of the James Bond series and for fans of action-adventure movies.  This movie is a winner and a keeper.<br /><br />Enjoy!nomination for Saturn Awards this movie received for Best Action/Adventure Film  and Best Actor by the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films (USA).

B000EHRVP6|2.0|After watching this film I decided to be scientific and use the process of elimination to determine how someone might have been able to appreciate it since I hadn't.  Aesthetics is, after all, a subjective experience, so a little objective rigor brought to bear on enjoyable experiences others might have had watching this movie should theoretically enable me to expand my own repertoire of aesthetic responses.<br /><br />The first way one could not have found enjoyment watching this film is by being seduced by the exotic locales.  Yes, there was a pan that lasted for about a minute of a pretty Czech village, but otherwise the Newtonian law of cinematics has once again been confirmed, and here's the proof:  In the Bollywood movie, Humtum, a scene that was meant to occur in Paris was filmed on the Museumplein in Amsterdam; so the equal and opposite gaffe was bound to be committed somewhere.  In Hostel, scenes meant to occur in Amsterdam have been filmed (jarringly) in Prague.  And just like they did with the Americans in Borat, I can imagine (in the cynical frame of mind this movie put me in) the filmmakers telling European colleagues and extras, \\"Don't worry, it doesn't matter - we'll never show this in your country.\\" Well, it eventually mattered to the fratboy who wanted to bring slavery back, and it should have mattered to the filmmakers. QED.<br /><br />After also eliminating direction, script, and acting as potential means for appreciating this movie I started to worry.  Yes, much thought had obviously gone into making this thing; but the Dusk-To-Dawn pleasure/pain structure and obscure references didn't mesh well with the low-budget sinister spin on European Vacation.  Worse, the unfortunate juxtaposition of beautiful naked flesh and extreme torture in this film exerts a pernicious influence on the psyche of the viewer - surely that couldn't have been intended.  And then, like being shot by a diamond bullet right through my forehead, it became clear that I'd completely missed the point.  This is a message film, and I'd been stupid not to pick up on the movie's lofty ambitions.<br /><br />The next challenge was to decipher the message, and I tell you this is the part that took the most time.  At first I suspected a sort of buried agenda to keep Americans from traveling outside their country.  The lesson seemed so clear that sublimely beautiful European temptresses want our dollars, but they will 1) mock us at every opportunity for not being cool in an effeminate, European way, 2) shield their true intentions by brazenly conspiring against us to our face in their unfamiliar native tongues, 3) have an almost psychic rapport with thuggish male fellow-countrymen who intend to punish us for having both the motive (wanting to have sex with beautiful girls) and opportunity (lots of aforesaid dollars and girls with loose morals) to steal their women, 4) ultimately sell us over to be tortured because they'll do anything for money (those loose morals again), and 5) succeed in their nefarious plan because the rule of law ends at the US border.<br /><br />But this interpretation sounded paranoid when I played it back, and I suspected the ultra-violence of the movie had once again influenced my state of mind.  What if this do-not-leave-the-US message was really the unintentional result of some other process at work in the filmmakers' master plan?  So I started listening to the commentary track for more insight, but it was really irritating and I couldn't listen to the whole thing.  They've apparently re-coined the expression, `bully', which must be a sort of Teddy Roosevelt macho thing.<br /><br />Their country's recent actions around the world have made many Americans feel self-conscious and unloved abroad.  It's unrealistic to think all the issues caused by this will be resolved so soon after the trauma.  Americans have a very pronounced sense of national identity, and we should expect some confused, troubled people doing things that might not make immediate sense while they work things out for themselves.<br /><br />Also; paying women for sex has a long history, and I wouldn't think to question its place in society.  However, like all those things we're taught from childhood are wrong, paying for sex sets off a complex chain reaction of deep, conflicting emotions.  It's not always pretty to see these emotions being worked through, and unintentionally choosing film as the medium to do this was probably a mistake.<br /><br />Having exhausted all other reasonable avenues, I've come to the scientific conclusion that the only way to appreciate this movie is to share the sensibilities, sensitivities, and neuroses of the filmmakers; and I find these to be distasteful.  This film helps to mark a key boundary of aesthetic territory, and like the man said: \\"you never know what's enough until you know what's too much.\\"hings that might not make immediate sense while they work things out for themselves. <br /> <br />Also; paying women for sex has a long history, and I wouldn't think to question its place in society.

0143038419|5.0|It's no fluke that Gilbert's travel book has soared to the top of best-sellers lists in paperback. She's a great writer, an extremely interesting lady, and as most fine authors ... brutally honest. But above all she is naturally hilarious, and she makes you want to know her and travel along with her. You wouldn't think anyone could succeed with such an ambitious title, let alone based on real-life experiences, but she pulls it off. I passed on my copy to my sister, and now I'm sorry I did. Buy it if you are recently divorced, buy it if you are happily married, buy it if you're female, buy it if you're male ... but above all buy it!

It is a book that I have already read twice and probably will read it several more times.
0679720200|5.0|Short crisp sentences. Easy to read, but in total not necessarily easy to understand if you start thinking about what this story might mean. Just like in his novel \\"The Plague\\" Camus rubs the hard reality of death in your face to force the eternal, meaning-of-life question to the surface.<br /><br />In the hot sun under the influence of a lot of wine Meursault stumbles into killing an Arab. What was he thinking? He is a man who thinks for himself. How could he get himself into such trouble? Unlike everyone else (according to the priest) when faced with death Meursault does not submit to the comfort the priest offers, even though he admits he is afraid.<br /><br />More proof that Meursault was an independent thinker can be found on page 42 where he expresses his opinion about Paris: \\"It's dirty. Lots of pigeons and dark courtyards. Everybody's pale.\\"

B000KRNCYY|4.0|[Actually, I give this 4-1/2 stars] Having enjoyed the original \\"Celtic Woman\\" CD immensely, I was really looking forward to \\"A New Journey.\\"  Thankfully, this album did not disappoint. <br /> <br />\\"Celtic Woman - A New Journey,\\" while predominantly Celtic, also showcases some Classical (\\"Lascia Ch'io Pianga\\") as well as popular music (\\"Over the Rainbow,\\" \\"Beyond the Sea\\").  Once again, Chloe's, Lisa's, Meav's and Orla's voices are pure and bell-like, and on pitch throughout the entire album, and Mairead is as captivating as always with her violin. <br /> <br />Hayley Westenra (whom I enjoyed immensely from her \\"Pure\\" CD) is a welcome addition to Celtic Woman.  She has the most classically trained voice of the group, and her rendition of \\"Lascia Ch'io Pianga\\") is exquisite.  I also very much enjoyed Chloe Agnew, who did sweet renditions of \\"The Prayer\\" and \\"Vivaldi's Rain,\\" as well as Lisa's \\"Caledonoia\\" and \\"The Blessing.\\"  Orla's \\"Carrickfergus\\" and Meav's \\"The Last Rose of Summer\\" are also worth listening to. <br /> <br />The biggest highlight for me was their close harmony on \\"Over the Rainbow,\\" which nearly sent shivers up my spine.  This journey into paradise finishes on an upbeat note with \\"Mo Ghile Mear.\\" <br /> <br />The only real disappointment is that they did not include some of my favorite songs from the PBS special; if I had held out for the \\"Deluxe Edition,\\" I could have gotten those additional tracks.  Even without these bonus tracks, however, the album is still a delight to listen to and one I would highly recommend.

He has a lovely balance between jazz, blues and soft-rock. I have listened to this album repeatedly on my high end music system at home and also on the car CD. It sounds amazing everywhere -- even as background music at Starbucks (hehe :)). Highly recommended.

1563894696|3.0|Batman: The Long Halloween is a story set in the early years of Batman's history.  The writer apparently sets out to do three things in this story.  First, it depicts the transition of Gotham from a city where the mob ran rampant to one where a rogues gallery of homicidal maniacs and super-villains have pushed the old criminals out.  Second, it shows different visions of justice in the guises of Batman, Harvey Dent, and Jim Gordon.  Third, it presents a murder mystery which is supposed to be intriguing and a challenge to the World's Greatest Detective.  Well, it accomplishes the first two and fails miserably with the last.  Although some readers might think the ending is clever, in my view, it is not for the simple reason that the writer did not play fair with neither Batman nor the audience.  No clues were given to point to the identity of the real killer, so neither Batman nor the reader has any chance at uncovering the villain's identity.  Moreover, the writer breaks the cardinal rule of writing a murder mystery...if the killer has something to gain, the detective must find whatever that is to track the killer down.  In this story, that was absent because by committing the murders, the killer actually pushed what that person wanted farther away from the killer.  Finally, as for the detective himself, Batman basically phones in any attempt to engage in detective work in the story and really does nothing to try and solve the underlying crimes because of the distractions caused by his rogues gallery.    Now for the parts that were brilliant.  The artwork was excellent, very noir and fit the story well.  The story does a fantastic job of rounding out Dent's character and making him far more believable than other stories have shown in the past.  Selina/Catwoman looked sexy and was an interesting character in the story (although the writer fails to explain why she was involved with the mobsters).  As for the rogues gallery, some of the depictions were fantastic, such as the Scarecrow, Ivy, and the Mad Hatter.  I did have problems with the drawings of the Joker...too many teeth and a bit too stylistic.  Also, the depiction of Solomon Grundy was very lame.  Grundy, at times, has given the entire JLA fits.  Yet, a young Batman was able to give him a bloody nose with one punch?  Very inconsistent.  He wasn't that important to the story to screw up the character's capabilities like that.    So, this story starts with a bang but due to the dropped plotlines, the poor job of connecting the dots, and the muddled motive, it misses the target and fails in its bid to become a classic like Kingdom Come.
B000G759LW|4.0|When I heard Aguilera was releasing a double album that used classic jazz and classic 60s/70s soul music (which I love a lot), I just had to check out what her idea of \\"classic jazz and soul music\\" were. I could picture myself rolling my eyes at her feeble attempts to sample and/or immulate Oleta Adams, Natalie Cole, or *gasp* Mariah Carey, all 80s/90s musicians which are, in my mind, not true soul singers but a Xerox copy of someone trying to market true soul/jazz music and come off sounding like voices played over poor Muzak one would hear in an elevator or at one's dentist office waiting room. They are what's disgraced soul music in recent years.<br /><br />What I recall as the \\"Intro (Back to Basics)\\" track resonated was thinking \\"What am I getting myself into?\\" as Christina sets the groundwork in her own words of what kind of album the listener can expect -- an album that makes her \\"wanna understand what made the soul singers and the blues figures that inspired a higher generation.\\" She ends by saying the album's a tribute that she's paying to these musical inspirations. Let me state that it isn't Aguilera's singing voice that worries me 'cause, let's face it, the girl can surely sing. No, I was more concerned with the arrangement, songwriting and production of the songs.<br /><br />Next, the once-teenage \\"Genie in a Bottle\\" and \\"Dirrty\\" girl began \\"Makes Me Wanna Pray\\" with the wail of a gospel singer and Traffic's own Steve Winwood on piano as she begins to sing lyrics of her transformation into a woman. While this may come off sounding trite and foolish from other artists of her ilk (i.e. Britney Spears, Jessica Simpson, JoJo, etc.), Christina's booming voice, backed up by a full gospel choir, transform the atheist into a believer. The next track \\"Back in the Day,\\" which made me extremely nervous because she starts name-dropping in her samples. And not just any names, but THE names: Otis Redding, Aretha Franklin, Louis Armstrong, Lena Horne, Etta James, Gladys Knight, James Brown, etc. I wasn't too impressed with this track at first, but it started taking hold of me as I began to pick up what Ms. Aguilera (sorry, Mrs. Bratman) was laying down.<br /><br />When the horns blare to the intro of \\"Ain't No Other Man,\\" I am delivered the catchy jazz/big band-sounding song I longed for. Being the first radio single from the massive album was a very wise choice. This continues in the brilliant 70's soul-tinged \\"Understand.\\" The hook of the chorus and piano sound as if Aguilera wrote with another soul favorite of mine, Alicia Keys. Aguilera's earnest apology to her lover is a true soul gem and one of the highlights on this album.<br /><br />\\"Slow Down Baby,\\" another track sounding as if coming under Black-Eyed Peas production, has Aguilera sounding off to a man, turning him down and telling him how she's already got a lover who satisfies. The track is catchy but not much my cup of tea. The lyrics to \\"Oh Mother\\" are poignant and based on Aguilera's mother's struggle with her physically abusive ex-husband (Christina's father). Although it took guts to write such a song and the words are inspiring, unfortunately, the vocals and lyrics are good but the music is flat. \\"F.U.S.S.\\" is a brief interlude, featuring Aguilera saying goodbye to one of her former writing partners from her previous release [[ASIN:B00006CXXU Stripped]], though I'm not positively sure, but I believe it to be Scott Storch, a famous rap/dance music producer. The song quickly segues into \\"On Our Way\\" with a piano and Aguilera almost apologizing for her words in \\"F.U.S.S.\\" (or maybe it's a new-found respect for a new partner).<br /><br />The following song \\"Without You\\" begins to make me nervous again because of the repetitive lyrics of Aguilera praising her lover, but set to a generic fingersnap-beat and moog synthesizer, making her sound like an Oleta Adams or light Mariah Carey from her pre-\\"Butterfly\\" days. \\"Still Dirrty\\" doesn't help much either as it sounds like Aguilera's still promising her male fans that she \\"still got the nasty\\" in her. The lyrics shine confidence and a tough exterior but when the girls background voices shout \\"Sexy!\\" in the chorus, it comes off sounding as if the track belongs on an A*Teens or Kidz Bop album.<br /><br />As the first disc comes to a close, it ends great with \\"Here to Stay,\\" featuring a horn sample and lyrics showcasing the true determination that Aguilera was trying to show us on \\"Still Dirrty.\\" Only, with \\"Here to Stay,\\" Aguilera's new sense of musicmaking, and what it is to not only be a true musician dipping her toes in all musical genres, but also a true music lover, comes through with a funky beat that anyone can appreciate. The first disc concludes with a fitting, warm tribute to her fans on \\"Thank You,\\" featuring real audio messages from her fans as she belts out thankful words for those who've stuck by her side.<br /><br />In so few words, the second disc is where this album becomes genius. Opening with a circus ringmaster's voice in \\"Enter the Circus,\\" the MC prepares the listener for a disc of songs that are out of the ordinary for Aguilera and her fan base. The dizzying circus choir voices sound like something from a wacky Tim Burton/Danny Elfman movie, a la \\"Nightmare Before Christmas,\\" \\"Batman Returns,\\" or \\"Beetle Juice.\\" The music instantly segues into \\"Welcome\\" with its own Broadway Tim Rice-sounding overture and vocals. This is the perfect opener with the singer giving away her plight and ending with a simple whistling tune set to violin.<br />Suddenly, we're transported back to the 1940s and get a delightful treat in \\"Candyman\\" with its big band Glenn Miller sound and what could easily be the Andrews Sisters backing Aguilera up on vocals.<br /><br />Next up is the smoky, sultry, sexy 40's burlesque striptease of \\"Nasty Naughty Boy,\\" full on with Aguilera letting out very suggestive, sexual innuendo lyrics in one of the truly most sexually-charged songs since En Vogue remade \\"Giving Him Something He Can Feel.\\" This song, in my opinion, solidifies Aguilera as a classy sex symbol even more than any of her \\"dirrty\\" attempts off \\"Stripped\\" ever could.<br />\\"I Got Trouble\\" is a slow, drunken honky-tonk blues song sounding like it's coming from an old 30s/40s radio, and proves Aguilera's effortless ability to be able to sing anything. \\"Hurt\\" is a grander production in Aguilera's musical as she sings about the effects of hurting someone she truly cares about but whom she chooses not to make a part of her life. The song is mostly made of full orchestra until the last minute-and-a-half of the song when the percussion kicks in, but soon returns to a lonely violin in true Broadway ballad fashion.<br /><br />Obviously, Aguilera's muse for most of her songs is her husband, record exec Jordan Bratman. But it's also clear that a refreshing spirituality has awoken in her as well. This is glimpsed not only on \\"Makes Me Wanna Pray,\\" but also on \\"Mercy On Me,\\" a bluesy gospel-sounding recording begging for a savior, which sounds a lot like Fiona Apple. While the track is good, I still think it could have used a small gospel choir in the background throughout. I never thought Aguilera could pull off simple acoustic pop folk-like arrangement, but then I heard \\"Save Me From Myself.\\" This is a stripped-down acoustic guitar with cello and two violins, accompanying Aguilera's wistful, flowery vocals that are all pulled off impressively with lyrics that altogether make the song a wonderful treat.<br /><br />To end this disc, and Aguilera's musical, is the epic \\"The Right Man,\\" again inspired by Bratman and the couple's wedding day. The song is brilliant as Aguilera sings from first person narrative on the scene of the man she's about to marry, all the while the strings express an anxiety of which any bride can acquiesce. Clearly the setting is the church as Aguilera's bride walks down the aisle and the listener can imagine her bridesmaids and the groomsmen singing the choral background. Her singing, paired with the soothing strings, reaching its crescendo is a masterful use and blend of her voice and the music, and it is soon realized that this is the final act of Aguilera's masterpiece. The song ends with a whisper, letting the audience know that her happiness will live on through her daughter and teaching her what it is not only to find the \\"right man,\\" a good man, but also in being a woman.<br /><br />All in all, Christina Aguilera's \\"Back to Basics\\" surprisingly blew me out of the water and turned me into a believer in her musical talent. This album, although it has its flaws, is easily accessible for different music lovers as well as different generations, which is its likeability and its success.ion, solidifies Aguilera as a classy sex symbol even more than any of her \\"dirrty\\" attempts off \\"Stripped\\" ever could.  \\"I Got Trouble\\" is a slow, drunken honky-tonk blues song sounding like it's coming from an old 30s/40s radio, and proves Aguilera's effortless ability to be able to sing anything. \\"Hurt\\" is a grander production in Aguilera's musical as she sings about the effects of hurting someone she truly cares about but whom she chooses not to make a part of her life.

B000MTDRKE|4.0|Sola Scriptura is a good CD. Alot of the musical passages are excellent and at times reminiscent of Dream Theater's intense progressive metal. But I do have a problem with some of the lyrics. It just seems that every song and every passage Neil is praising God (which is ablsolutely fine) although it's like he uses the names of God or Jesus constantly throughout. It seems like he should chill and refrain a little bit more for the art's sake and build to more of what God's final conclusions for us are using more examples of the experiences of the here and now. I don't know if I am saying this right, it just seems that he has gone slightly overboard in continuing to make every CD with similar subject matter. But let me say that I am happy that he is so joyous in the spirit. There is absolutely nothing wrong with that. I just prefer to hear a little more variation in subject matter. By the way Paul Gilbert smokes on this CD! This is also some of Portnoy's best drumming with Neil. But I don't think that this compares to Transatlantic. I even like the latest Spock's Beard CD much more than Sola Scriptura simply because it has more variation. I believe that his previous CD \\"?\\" was his best. Maybe this one will grow more on me over time.
B000MGUZM0|4.0|Arcade Fire has influences that are listed as follows: Echo & The Bunnymen, Roxy Music, Talking Heads, David Bowie, Pixies, and Joy Division. And that's the perfect way to attempt to describe their second, full new album, Neon Bible, to anyone who doesn't know their music. The more generic way is to say, \\"Imagine very early David Bowie (circa \\"Rock and Roll Suicide\\") blended with Talking Heads and you get Arcade Fire.\\" Not only does lead vocalist Win Butler sound distinctly like David Byrne, but Arcade Fire's latest sound on Neon Bible does touch on a few of their influences listed above. Still, from the first beats off the first track, the heavy David Bowie-influenced song \\"Black Mirror,\\" the listener can tell this is not merely some Bowie- or Talking Heads-wannabe group. This band is shooting for something more. More grandiose. More epic. More poetic.<br /><br />  While I do like this album, I have to say that it's not quite the hit that most reviewers are making it out to be; an AOL critic listed them as the \\"new saviors of rock n' roll.\\" And while I wouldn't go so far as to say that, this is a good album - especially considering the latest releases nowadays. However, it's not an instantaneously well-liked album. This one takes a few times of listening before one can truly appreciate the originality that Arcade Fire is putting out there on this album. Now, most would say that a mix of Bowie and Byrne isn't exactly all that original. Oh, contraire! Win Butler and gang throw in these influences (as well as some Bruce Springsteen-like sounds) for sure, but they also take some original, dark lyrics (which most times are very poetic and, without sounding too pretentious, deep) and superb musical instrumentation. In fact, if I had to pick which was the best on this album: the singing/lyrics or the music; I'd definitely pick the music. Ranging from the very heavy pipe organ to choirs to a hurdy gurdy to full orchestras, Neon Bible is extremely eclectic!<br /><br />  The second track, \\"Keep the Car Running,\\" starts off with a bit of synthesizer then pounds into a piano key craze as Butler takes very Springsteen-esque lyrics (a la the Born in the U.S.A. album) and goes manic with them. After a while, he breaks into ahhhs and a drum beat elevates the song before it suddenly cuts. The next track \\"Neon Bible,\\" is a silent, dark premonition with lyrics like \\"In the Neon Bible, the Neon Bible/Not much chance for survival/If the Neon Bible is true.\\" The song only lasts about 2 minutes and 15 seconds and is probably my second least favorite on the album. However, it is followed by my favorite song on the album, \\"Intervention.\\" Again, the album continues its dark themes with content about working for the Church while your family dies, a soldier going at it alone, and every spark of friendship and love dying. Now, don't be too dismayed by this content. Most would think by now that this album is merely another depressing album by some emo/goth depressing band. And if you've assumed that by now with this album, then you couldn't be more wrong! Although there are dark lyrics, like The Rolling Stones' \\"Gimme Shelter\\" and Springsteen's \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" (both songs with a fast tempo set to dark lyrics), the music with which Arcade Fire chooses to deliver their messages, is at times upbeat and also sometimes drowns out the lyrics. This track with a small choir (led by Butler's wife and band member Regine Chassagne) and pipe organ bring the album to new heights and leave it soaring, leading the way for the next tracks which although not as good as this one, are much better than the beginning of the album.<br /><br />  Chassagne leads off the next song, \\"Black Wave/Bad Vibrations\\" with what sounds like a bad rendition of a 1980s Flying Lizards song. She even does a bit of French (staying true to their French-Canadian roots), which isn't the first time it's heard on this album, but it doesn't compliment the song at all. I'm all for female lead vocalists (her vocals on \\"The Well and the Lighthouse\\" are good) - trust me - but, unfortunately, Chassagne needs to stick to leading the background vocals and choirs on this album. Luckily, Butler tears into song about a minute and forty seconds in and that's when the song improves. Nevertheless, \\"Vibrations\\" is my least favorite song on the album. The next track is \\"Ocean of Noise.\\" The song is very 80's Bowie or 80's Springsteen, and utilizes heavy mandolin and piano; it is musically wonderful with a splendid use of brass at the end. It is the singer's promise to perhaps work on himself in the empty streets he lives in. This is the true beginning of the album's progression as it jumps into \\"The Well and The Lighthouse\\" - a song that is very much a story; better yet, it's like a Chinese fable set to music. The singer tells of his crimes and how he doesn't regret a thing. Even as he is resurrected to forever watch over a lighthouse, he still wonders about the girl for whom he supposedly commited the crime.<br /><br />  With the most words in any of the album's songs, the interestingly-named \\"(Antichrist Television Blues)\\" starts off with post-9/11 sentiments with the singer confessing, \\"I don't wanna work in a building downtown/I don't know what I'm gonna do/'Cause the planes keep crashing always two by two.\\" But, shortly after, it's revealed that the singer is praying to God about his talented daughter who can sing. It's apparent that the singer wants to quit this downtown job to get his daughter to become a famous pop icon (maybe via the ultimate Antichrist TV show, American Idol?). The song is jumpy and goes slightly frantic as the singer notices the absurd lengths he will go to get his daughter to become famous. It is by the end that he notices his greed and willingness to exploit his daughter, and turns the prayer on himself by asking God, \\"O tell me, Lord, am I the Antichrist?\\" \\"Windowsill\\" is as rebellious a song as any of Springsteen's early cries for freedom in \\"Born to Run\\" or \\"Thunder Road,\\" or from his generation rebellion of \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town.\\" The singer continues to announce how he doesn't want to live in his father's house any more, which is most likely a metaphor for him not wanting to become his father or live the way his father does. With references to a fear of World War III, his father's debt, and begging MTV to set him free (which could mean he sees MTV as his savior or his captor; you decide, but I'm guessing the latter), Butler begins to repeat his sentiments as that beautiful music I praised earlier in this review comes howling up in the form of a horn section and an orchestra and the slightest touch of a gospel choir.<br /><br />  \\"No Cars Go\\" isn't exactly the most profound lyrical song on this album (in fact, it's quite mindless), but, again, musically it is pretty good. The Talking Heads sound is in full effect on this song and although I heard it's a favorite at live shows, the album version is merely an excuse to mindlessly crank the volume in your car while you're doing 70 mph on the highway. The album closer, \\"My Body is a Cage,\\" is probably the best lyrical song on the album (next to \\"Intervention\\" and \\"The Well and the Lighthouse\\")! With lyrics like \\"My body is a cage that keeps me from dancing/With the one I love/But my mind holds the key\\" and \\"I'm living in an age/Whose name I don't know/Though the fear keeps me moving/Still my heart beats so slow\\" the listener knows this is Arcade Fire's main point to all of their dark lyrics on the album: that only you control how dark and depressing your life may be. The song itself has Butler begin with a high cracking voice while musically it is soon flooded with pipe organ and a gospel choir, as well as having a beautiful undertone use of trumpets/horns that makes the song sound like some dark James Bond theme. A good closer to the album as Butler pleads to set his spirit and body free. Free from what? We can only imagine him wanting to overcome his own insecurities and live the free life he yearns for throughout the album.<br /><br />  Overall, even though there are some familiar past musical infusions on this album, in the wake of many soundalike rock/alternative groups nowadays, Arcade Fire's Neon Bible is a breath of fresh air! After a few listens, I've grown quite addicted to this album and it's quite often played during my long commutes to work. Musically, you can't find as much originality and eclecticism today. The only problem with the music at times is that it sometimes seems to drown out the vocals and you can't hear them quite as well. I heard that the album was recorded in a church and because of that and the album's poor mixing (the sound mixer should be replaced), the listener is sometimes robbed of the weird, astounding lyrics. My recommendation is that if you like ANY of the bands referenced in the first paragraph (it doesn't have to be all of them; I hate Roxy Music, with the exception of \\"If There is Something\\" - brilliant song) and a bit of Springsteen, and see this album reasonably priced, then bite the bullet and buy this album.

0307237699|4.0|Barack Obama is a refreshing politician.  If he can be taken at his word (and apparently he can), it is so pleasing to read his ideas on major issues without all the usual obscure language.  He speaks his mind simply and with a moral conviction.  While I haven't made my mind up about the next presidential election, Obama certainly has me thinking he is a candidate worth considering.  I recommend reading this book.  It does give one hope that our government can make progress on significant issues.

078322687X|3.0|I was a good little girl at school; I was never in detention. So I can't identify with this movie at all. Especially an American detention. They were there the whole of Saturday! And the antics they get up to!<br /><br />I got recommended this by someone I work with, who was playing the Simple Minds on her mp3 player, and I confessed I had no idea who they were. She said they did a song on the soundtrack to this, I said I'd never seen it, and she told me to get it. So I did.<br /><br />None of the actors have really done much since this film, apart from Emilio Estevez, who is still floating around out there. There's been lots of fuss about a sequel, but I doubt that will ever happen. It doesn't really warrant a sequel. Which means they will make a sequel or a remake. And that will ruin it.<br /><br />Basically you have five teenage stereotypes - the rebel (Bender), the princess (Claire), the jock (Andy), the brain (Brian), and the outcast (Allison) - who would never normally associate with each other, but they get stuck together in detention. It can be a bit overacted, and a bit melodramatic at times, but yes, it works. My favourite character was the outcast, Allison, played by Ally Sheedy. She actually reminded me quite a lot of myself during high school (and at the beginning of college), hiding behind her fringe, coat, whatever comes to hand, and not speaking to anyone. Her haircut was practically the same as mine too! And the dandruff/snow on the drawing scene was absolutely classic! The reasons they all get into detention are a bit strange as well: Bender: pulls a false fire alarm; Brian: flare gun goes off in his locker; Andy: tapes a guy's butt cheeks together in the locker room; Claire: ditches class to go shopping; and Allison: didn't do anything, she didn't have anything better to do on a Saturday. (That last bit made the character for me.)<br /><br />The rest of the movie is pretty much forgettable, apart from the dancing sequence, which is so funny.<br /><br />If you recognise yourself in these characters, or know someone else who was that particular stereotype, then I would recommend getting it. It's easy enough to while away an hour or so watching. It will also show what you're really like depending which character is your favourite. What does your favourite reveal about you? It's a shame I'm not old enough to remember the 80s (ha!) I was born halfway through, and wasn't old enough to know about the whole Rat Pack phenomenon.

0743289412|5.0|I think this was one of my top 10 favorite Stephen King books.  I wasn't sure if I was going to like this one or not, since it is a love story, but after the first 50 pages or so, I was hooked.  It was an intricate, beautifully woven love story, and I wish we all had a place like Boo'ya Moon to escape the harsh realities of life for awhile.  I especially liked the characters, especially the sisters.  They were richly done! <br />I loved that they were average, middle-aged women.  Wonderful work!
B000NA28IE|3.0|I have to say first of all that I loved the books and am impatiently awaiting the 3rd release. The books by themselves are masterpieces - especially considering Christopher Paolini was only 16 when he wrote Eragon. Most 16 year olds can't even stay focused long enough to get through a 45 min. high school class, let alone write a best selling novel. <br /> <br />    As for the movie - i'm not sure. If you HAVE NOT read the books, it makes for a great hour and a half of an action, adventure, dungeons and dragons type epic that is catered to a \\"family\\" audience. Children, young adults, and even adults can enjoy this movie as a stand alone film.  So many key elements of the book were left out of the movie - that could have been added if the movie was only say another half hour longer. I really couldn't speculate as to why Christopher Paolini would agree to such an incorrect rendition of his outstanding works of literature, but I think it has to do with getting the audience involved. People wanted a way to experience the book without actually reading it - which is what most people want when it comes to popular works of literature (so they can say \\"ya I read that,\\" when really they're far too lazy and skipped right to the movie). If that's what the filmaker's were aiming for, congrats, you succeeded!  <br /> <br />      All in all, the special effects were pretty well done, the story was a little rushed, but certainly not boring. A pretty good piece of fiction that could have been better. Very similar to the movie king arthur - a good stand alone move if it hadn't been based on an already existing legend (or in this case book).

Reading about the 5 different love languages was very helpful especially when it came down to learning about my own and that of my spouse.  I would highly recommend the book to any couple.  Each chapter has exercises to follow and at the end both you and your spouse answer a questionnaire to determine what your individual love languages are. Now I know how to keep my husbands love tank full.
B00005JPLU|5.0|It's this year's first real \\"Feel Good\\" violent bloody massacre film, that is, if you are not an Islamic Fundamental Terrorist (from Iran). After all if Javad Shamqadri, cultural advisor to Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad does not want you to see this film, what is that saying?     All kidding aside, this is what happened during WWII and for that matter the cold-war.  Unfortunately for the Islamic Fundamental Terrorist (and Iran), just like the Fascists and Communists before them, \\"Hollywood\\" (for all its faults) is the ultimate propaganda machine.  This propaganda machine serves and is motivated by its intended audience which only seems to flourish in a free society.       Even though it is inspired by a comic book, we are not talking about a kid's comic book (yes there are adults who read comics intended for adult audiences). So, I understand that this film is most definitely NOT for children, teenagers or any one who can not understand or deal with the complete and total violence of war.  Its commentary on the War On Terror is, I think, unintended.  However, if you are an adult and understand that we are at war, you will appreciate this film.    The look of the film captures the feel of the comic artistry, its straight forward storyline fallows that of the limited series with the same title (loosely based on the Greek/Persian Wars).  As with the comic there are cultural aspects both exploited and missing from all sides in this story.  And, like most films based on literary works there are some missing elements here and there.  Once all is said and done, we vote with our ticket/DVD purchases.  The record setting take on opening week indicates that Hollywood's propaganda machine has, once again,  achieved a direct hit.  Also, look for this film to be remembered in 2008 for its visual effects during award season.
B000MCH5P4|1.0|<br />BABEL is like traveling through an elaborate hedge maze to get to Jessica Simpson's high school sociology report. <br /> <br />Pitt gives yet another of his towering, multi-layered performances.  The black hole vacuum he creates on the screen is so great it even sucks in the usually brilliant Kate Blanchett.  Not for one minute will you believe the scenario these two play out. <br /> <br />Kudos to one solitary brilliant moment when a deaf-mute attends a rave club (though its relation to the film is laughable, as is this whole story thread).  The rest of the movie plays out like a bad remake of TALES OF MANHATTAN, only this time with a gun instead of a hat.   <br /> <br />I can think of episodes of Three's Company that had more original, profound statements to make than this film. <br />
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Having been a so-so Eagles fan in the past, I came across this DVD by accident, while perusing home theater systems at a Best Buy.  The band is tight and the vocals are right on the money.<br /><br />My biggest surprise yet was that I had been wondering where Steuart Smith had gone to after seeing that he was no longer playing on any of Rodney Crowell's recent albums.  I was astounded to see him playing in this Eagles line-up, playing only as Steuart can . . . perfect.<br /><br />For a concert album, this one surpasses your average, mundane fare.  I think you will really get your money's worth, whether you are a die-hard Eagles fan or have been a so-so listener such as I was.  Buy it!
B000M341QO|5.0|Scorcese's best since Raging Bull.  DiCaprio's anguish at being undercover is almost palpable - as is Mark Wahlberg's despair at losing his Captain! Even Matt Damon - you loved to hate him in this role, same for Alec Baldwin who is always great!  A truly great picture.BRAVO ALL!!
B000MGUZMU|3.0|Before Neon Bible, I was a rabid Arcade Fire fan.  I've had the luck to see them twice on stage, the first time way back when they were still playing super-small venues.  I consider Funeral one of the five CDs I'd have to have with me if I could only choose five and had to live only listening to those five on a deserted island.  But I've just finished listening to the CD the whole way through, and I have to say I'm not pleased.      Neon Bible misses everything that was great about the first LP - an album that was frenetic and passionate at times, calm and beautiful in others, but with evident emotion all the way through - and replaces it with slow, meandering, claptrap.  It's like they were desperate to find inspiration that could possibly match the deaths of members of their families.  Maybe they found a few muses, but they couldn't focus on them.  I think it's incredibly evident in the fact that they took \\"No Cars Go\\" from their self-titled EP, an EP that only gave more evidence of their potential continued brilliance, and felt they had to rework it.  Now I like their live version of \\"No Cars Go\\" much better than their EP version - not because the EP version is bad, far from it, it's great.  But the live version is fiery and awesome to behold.  That passion is seriously lacking in the remake.      There was a hint of the good sounds in \\"My Body is a Cage.\\"    I really want The Arcade Fire to succeed, because they have such incredible potential and put on a better freaking show than tons of the veteran rockers out there, so hey, maybe they'll come back next album.
B000063UR1|5.0|A truly classic cult sci-fi!  So unusual - Joan Baez's music adds just the right wierd touch to this great movie - so fitting today, in its theme of ecology and save the planet - this is right up there with Blade Runner - the greatest sci-fi of all time.

0374105235|5.0|Ishmael Beah is a crusader and a recent college graduate speaking out for children affected by war in New York.  His book is about his survival as a soldier fighting in the war in Sierra Leone.  After losing his home and his family in the violence, he  becomes a soldier in the war.  He describes raiding villages, stealing food, and weapons.  He also discusses his addiction to marijuana and cocaine openly too. I felt sad reading this part of the book.  I enjoyed reading about how Ishmael's life changes during  eight months in a rehab  house.  His whole attitude about life changes as he continues his education.  He also starts to make friends and eventually turns away from his violent past.  I enjoyed reading his love of performing and rap music during his rehab period.  I felt hopeful and happy reading this part of the book.  There is a chronology of the history of Sierra Leone at the end of the book.  I thought this part of the book was very interesting.  A Long Way Gone is an excellent read.

B000KCHZK6|5.0|I now have all of Norah Jones' CDs and I have to say I can count on one finger the number of artists that have delivered 100% satisfaction with every output. That one vote goes to Norah Jones. Each and every song is as good as the last in my opinion, just like the first two collections. If you liked either of the first two albums you will like this one. The same style, the same exceptional quality.

B000JBWWRY|5.0|I had read reviews and there were more reviews for the Orville Redenbacker popper then just the Presto so I went with it.  The machine does a great jop of popping the corn.  I have been using Generic popcorn from Safeway and its great.  I add the seasoning from No More Naked Popcorn and it makes a great afternoon snack.  I believe the Presto without the name is the same but have not seen it to be sure.

B000MXPE74|4.0|The Fratellis specialize in two things -- solid, slightly grimy guitar rock and laddish lyrics.<br /><br />That's pretty much the core of their solid debut album, \\"Costello Music,\\" which has the Glasgow band rocking out with a gleeful enjoyment. Nowhere to be found is the mournful quality of their fellow Scottish bands. Instead, we just have sprightly, intensely catchy guitar rock that will have you singing about the Costello music.<br /><br />It opens with some rapid-fire drums and a catchy little riff, blooming out into a straightforward get-away-from-your-life song. Basically it's about some mischievous partying guys asking a young wife to leave her bland life behind, and come \\"live with us among the has beens and the addicts.\\" Weirdly enough, it sounds appealing.<br /><br />Over a bed of nimble guitars, John Lawler/Jon Fratelli sings happily, \\"Dear Henrietta we're just three lonely boys/Though the girls love us we're so/Into you incredibly we'd love to see you terribly/We'd love to hate you but we don't have no choice!\\"<br /><br />It's followed by the unstoppable, quirky \\"Flathead,\\" which is followed by a string of songs in the same style -- bouncy guitarpop, a languid sort of acoustic beach ballad, rollicking Britrock with fun sprightly melodies, rapid-fire guitar rock, and even a sort of bluesy-country-rocker at the finale. It's like sledding down a hill of kinetic music.<br /><br />\\"Costello Music\\" -- which is named after a character from rock spoof \\"Still Crazy -- isn't quite ideal, since some of the songs sound a bit too similar styilistically. But it's a pretty small problem for a pretty good band, whose songs are basically celebrations of solid music and fun times out on the town.<br /><br />Lawler and Barry Wallace are still kind of raw, but they can spin up some solid, catchy rock rhythms from sprightly riffs and murky bass, occasionally turning the music into an avalanche of unstoppable riffs. And Gordon McRory spices things up with a bit of banjo and bells in \\"Flathead,\\" as well as a smashing set of drums that match Lawler's guitars perfectly.<br /><br />Lawler has a nice strong voice with a scratchy edge when he yells; he sounds like a stoked-up young guy who's recounting the crazy night out he just had. \\"And she danced like a medicine man/Drew a crazy picture on my hand and told me/She wanted to change my point of view/Asked me where I was going to...\\"<br /><br />\\"Costello Music\\" has the rough edges you'd expect on a debut, but this band is just bursting with energy and catchiness.

0712676090|4.0|I admit that I opened this book with cynicism. My boss gave me a copy and told me I should read it with an open mind; that I should know what corporate executives mean when they natter on about hedgehogs and being on or off the bus. I'm no big fan of managing by the latest trendy fad and I assumed this book would fall into that category.<br /><br />In spite of my prejudice, I enjoyed this book. I didn't see any flaw in the methodology and I like the idea of collecting the data and following it where it leads. The bottom line, in my mind, is that leaders who believe in something bigger than themselves (a religious or quasi-religious concept) can enable and lead organizations to greatness. As an additional plus, it looks like Jim Collins `ate his own dog food'; he used the lessons learned to lead the research and writing team with great result. This book is interesting and fun to read.<br /><br />Ken Coffman is the author of Glen Wilson's Bad Medicine and other novels.
B00005JPG1|4.0|With \\"Zodiac,\\" director David Fincher returns to the crime thriller territory he explored to such effectiveness in \\"Seven\\" a dozen odd years ago.<br /><br />For over a decade - from December 1968 to the late 1970's - a serial killer calling himself The Zodiac terrorized the San Francisco Bay Area, dispatching his victims seemingly at random while keeping up a cryptic, cat-and-mouse correspondence with several major newspapers in the area.  Despite some impressive leads, the killer was never caught and the murders eventually stopped as quickly and mysteriously as they had started.<br /><br />At 160 minutes, \\"Zodiac\\" lacks the streamlining and telescoping we've come to expect from movies about serial killers, which are more often designed for sensationalism and exploitation than contemplation and reflection.  Taking a novelistic approach to the subject, screenwriter James Vanderbilt gives the drama room to breathe, allowing detail to pile upon detail, and providing an array of characters who disappear from the drama for long periods of time only to return to center stage when called upon to do so by the facts of the case.<br /><br />The drawback in such a strategy is that the movie occasionally feels aimless and formless, as it ricochets back and forth between plot strands and characters that often seem at cross purposes to one another.  But the distinct advantage of this approach is that the movie feels less contrived and artificial and more akin to real life, as it captures the sometimes decidedly unglamorous nature and frustratingly plodding pace of actual crime detection.  And for those who might be hesitant to watch the film due strictly to its subject matter, it should be noted that, for a movie on such a grisly topic, \\"Zodiac\\" is surprisingly tame in the blood-and-guts department (thank goodness).<br /><br />Indeed, the movie gets its unnerving murder scenes out of the way right up front, so it can turn its full attention to its real areas of interest:  chronicling the behind-the-scenes search for the killer and exploring the psychological impact this search has on three men who become, to varying degrees, obsessed with the case.  Jake Gyllenhaal, who hit a career high water mark in 2005 with \\"Proof,\\" \\"Jarhead\\" and, of course, \\"Brokeback Mountain,\\" continues his journey into edgy roles playing Graysmith, the rather nerdy cartoonist for the San Francisco Chronicle, who managed to get closer to unveiling the true identity of the killer than anyone else, and who went on to write of his experiences in the book, \\"Zodiac Unmasked: The Identity of America's Most Elusive Serial Killer Revealed,\\" on which the film itself is based.  Graysmith was able to scoop even the lead investigator, David Toschi (sharply played by the always interesting Mark Ruffalo), who finds his life becoming ever more overtaken by the case the longer it drags on without resolution.  The third major actor in the drama is Paul Avery, the crime beat reporter who turned to drink, thereby torpedoing his own career, after the killer singled him out as a potential target.  It is the lack of screen time allotted to Avery that offers one of the genuine disappointments of the movie, especially as he is embodied by the brilliant Robert Downey Jr., whose own life experiences make him the perfect choice for the role.<br /><br />With its meticulously mounted, pitch-perfect recreation of the details of the case as well as the times in which they took place, \\"Zodiac\\" is one of the few films of recent years that can truly be termed a thinking man`s thriller.earch for the killer and exploring the psychological impact this search has on three men who become, to varying degrees, obsessed with the case.

0802136834|5.0|This book is great - very readable and engaging, yet factual. In fact, this is one book to use when deciding how true to actual events other books and DVDs are. Alison Weir is a first-rate writer - and historian. I like her even better than David Starkey, whom I've heard she counts as a mentor.
B000LC55F2|5.0|How much do I LOVE this movie?<br /><br />It has wonderful actors - Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine (love Michael Caine), Scarlett Johansson, Piper Perabo and I just discovered that David Bowie played one of the characters.<br /><br />The story line is excellent and the editing is tight, almost stingy. There's not a scene or a single bit of dialogue wasted. If a character makes a statement, or if an object is shown, it will absolutely have a bearing later on.<br /><br />Every character was convincing and Bale and Jackman are extremely intense as rival magicians. I am a huge fan of unorthodox films, particularly ones that do not follow chronological order, like 21 Grams and Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind.  The Prestige doesn't resort to an approach nearly as radical as those films.  It employs the tool just enough to keep the plot interesting, revealing lots of surprises along the way.

You won't get tired of listening to it, and the DVD experience is much better, in the way that you can  watch and feel how the musicians put their souls and enjoy playing Yanni's music. Well worth to have it in you collection.
B00005M91K|5.0|I'm not going to go into the meaning of this film for fear of turning people off who might buy it otherwise.  The visual experience alone is worth it, the images are stunning, sometimes startling.

B000M5AJQS|4.0|This is a completely mesmerizing film, definitely not for the squeamish.  The body count is uber high.  Martin Scorsese's film is boasts an impressive cast.  Leonardo DiCaprio, Jack Nicholson, Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg (quickly becoming one of my favorite actors), Martin Sheen and many more.<br /><br />Leonardo DiCaprio is brilliant in his portrayal of Billy Costigan, an undercover cop working as a mole in the Irish Mafia.  Matt Damon, Mark Wahlberg and Martin Sheen give solid performances in the film.  Vera Farmiga, the psychiatrist treating both Damon and DiCaprio's characters,<br /><br />gives a wonderful performance.<br /><br />The Departed delivers a powerful story that will keep you on the edge of your seat throughout the film.  The one distraction is the graphic body count.  I highly recommend the film, but with a very strong warning about the graphic portrayal of violence.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Awesome movie with the newest member of the Bon family, Daniel Craig. He did a great job portraying the Bond character in this movie. As Casino ROyale is actually the first book, the directors and producers did a great job not loading this with all the special effects not seen in Dr. No, but still had enough to tickle and Bond lover's fancy. Overall, one of the best Bond films out there and sure to stay that way. Great job Daniel Craig and all of the directors and producers on such a well done Bond film. I can not wait until next year for the next Bond film to premiere in theatres.

0743496728|5.0|From time to time over the course of the past year I'd see Jodi Picoult books on the shelves at my favorite Barnes & Noble, or I'd read reviews of books like My Sister's Keeper in my Entertainment Weekly magazines I keep in the bathroom. But I never really thought I'd read any of her books. Nothing actually caught my eye, until last weekend. <br /> <br />While in Baltimore a colleague's young daughter mentioned that Picoult had a new book dealing with a high school shooting. Was it too soon? I don't think it was. 9/11 was more recent and they had three movies about that, and this book doesn't attempt to be Columbine (or the plethora of other school shootings) but it does address the same issues. Upon my return to Arizona, I went on Amazon and searched for the book. I knew it was fairly new and Picoult wrote it. Scanning her titles, I came across Nineteen Minutes and immediately knew it was the correct book. No one needs to be told where she got her title.  <br /> <br />A few days later when I opened the book to begin it, the first page said \\"March 6, 2007\\" and chills crawled up my spine as I glanced at my own watch that read \\"March 7, 2007\\". Even before I began the book, I knew it could be now. It can be here. It can be anywhere. My wife hated high school and I, personally, relive it daily, but what would happen in this book. It began with a journal entry from Peter Houghton, a slight boy who was terminally teased in a small New Hampshire town by everyone from his best friend from kindergarten to his own older brother. The novel begins in media res with the school shooting and then we begin our story of how he got to this point. Picoult simply tells us where we are in the narrative with chapter titles like \\"First Day of Kindergarten\\" or \\"10 Days After\\".  <br /> <br />As I began this book I was confused by the plethora of characters introduced immediately, but as I read, I realized they would all play important parts to the narrative of the novel. For example, Alex Courmier is the mother of one of the survivors, a girl named Josie, who witnessed the murder of her boyfriend, Matt. Alex a law student and later a defense attorney who got pregnant out of wedlock and didn't want to keep her baby. Eventually she gave birth to Josie, and later became the sitting judge on the shooting trial. Lacy, the midwife who loved watching babies born into her arms, commented on how much potential children had, but later when she raced to the school to make sure her only living son was ok, she was informed he'd been taken into custody for killing 10 students and wounding 19 others. Patrick the investigating detective who lived alone and had no real life outside his job, the man who rushed into the school, arrested Peter Houghton, and carried the blacked out Josie out the front of the school. Jordan, the defense attorney, who agreed to take the case while holding his own infant son because everyone should have a fair trial. <br /> <br />The book weaves these characters and several others through the narrative that led up to \\"That Day\\" and then forward in time through the trial and culminating in the one year anniversary, as two characters stand at the old site of the shooting where, in a newly renovated atrium, 10 white chairs sat for the 10 victims. They watched the world continue around them and discussed the hopes, dreams, and despair from a town trying to heal itself from years of hurt.

B000MCH5P4|4.0|Great acting.  The deaf Japanese girl story was the most interesting.  Brad Pitt did a great job, but his character was ridiculous.  What made him think that a bus full of westerners would wait overnight in Morocco?  And if those folks were so scarred to be out in the middle of Morocco, why are they on that tour that takes them to the middle of nowhere Morocco?  And in all that time, why didn't they take the damn bus right to the hospital?  Silly really. <br /> <br />Too much like Traffic and Crash to be original enough for me.  Still pretty interesting.

It is visually stunning, well put together, and adapted beautifully.  I can think of no better way to bring classic literature into the minds of todays youth.  My 12 year old daughter is thrilled about attempting to read the play after watching this.  I couldn't get through the play when I was 17!
B0000UJL96|5.0|One last adventure with the beloved crew members of the Star Ship Enterprise. And what a way to go out. This is a great way to end a saga, and a very enjoyable film. Sometimes by the time you get to a part 6 of any movie series it has gotten to the point where its dull and not half of what it used to be. This movie though is anything but those things.<br /><br />This movie is all about bringing the hatred between the Earth run Starfleet and the Klingon Empire to a long over due end. Mostly due to the fact that one of the Klingon moons was destroyed in a freak explosion. Now desperate for help to restore the balance, the Klingons reach out to the human run Federation for peace and Captain Kirk and his loyal crew are volunteered by Mr. Spock to be peace officials to welcome in the soon to be Klingon friends.<br /><br />What both sides don't count on is the hatred that each still have for each other and how some will stop at nothing to make sure that peace doesn't happen. When the Enterprise fires on the Klingon ship after a peaceful meeting the Klingons take it as an act of war, even though the Enterprise didn't fire on them. Kirk and McCoy go over to try and help the injured leader of the Klingons and are arrested for the murder of him and sentenced to life on a prison camp. Now its up to Spock and Sulu who is now Captain of his own ship to figure out who was really behind this, rescue Kirk and McCoy and save the fragile peace conference that is still in danger from the would be killers before all out war breaks out. It is a true thought provoking and typical Star Trek type adventure that we have come to expect from the series and this movie doesn't disappoint on delivering that and more.<br /><br />After the very disappointing Part V, it was refreshing to see the crew back to their old ways of fun and adventure and giving the proper send off the original Enterprise gang deserved. We have classic moments of Kirk fighting some huge alien while he is in the prison camp and a mystery that Spock has to solve while running out of precious time. It is almost part adventure and part mystery and all fun with barely a dull moment to be found within. The characters are as fresh and lively as ever, even as the actors themselves seem to age, the characters only seem to get better. Everyone seemed to have a vital part this go around and show that they aren't ready for the scrap heap just yet.<br /><br />This is epic in that it is not only the last time all the original Star Trek actors will be together but that it bridges a lot of things together in the Star Trek universe as it shows the point that Earth and the Klingons finally reached towards peace. And opens up the path for the Next Generation that was ongoing at the same time of this movie's release. The only real drawbacks to the film were that Sulu's absence from the Enterprise did seem a bit out of place and some of the story moments seemed a bit rushed and far fetched at point ie) how easily they escaped prison and how quickly they were able to wrap things up at the end.<br /><br />This movie is highly recommended to anyone into the Star Trek series and even those who aren't should be able to follow the fun story easy enough. Part VI is easily up there with one of the better movies in the long going series of films and for good reason. It has a lot of hidden messages in it as well as most Star Trek situations seem to have under lying meanings that one can relate to a real world situation. So the cold war type of political feeling that this movie had along with the racism aspects that were felt did hit home to a real life situation that I'm sure most could relate to. It was a pretty deep story while at the same time a fun adventure.<br /><br />One last trip around the solar system with Kirk and crew and it was the perfect send off for each and every one of them. All good things must come to an end and thankfully this was a most fitting end and one that I think you will all enjoy watching many a time and get something different from it each time you do.<br /><br />May the Enterprise-A live on forever.hing many a time and get something different from it each time you do.<br /><br />May the Enterprise-A live on forever.

B00005JKLZ|3.0|H.G. Wells's classic tale of adventure and social commentary gets a new face in this latest film version.  A scientist obsessed with his work and always late manages to build a machine capable of moving through time.  His first attempts to improve things do not go as planned.  He seems able to change details of the past but not the main results so he turns toward the future.  He sees the progress of humanity as it builds and moves forward.  A catastrophic event involving the moon changes the world drastically.  Finally, 800,000 years into the future he stops.  There he meets a peaceful and idyllic people.  They are both primitive and advanced at the same time.  This seems like a beautiful new world.  But then the Morlocks rear their heads and the truth of the world is revealed. <br /> <br />Morlocks live underground and come up from time to time to prey on the innocents above.  While they do not like things this way they have no way to fight back.  The time traveler feels he needs to help these people and rescue those who have been taken.  Eventually he is successful to a point and works to make a new life for himself among these people of the future. <br /> <br />This film often seems less like a new adaptation of the novel and more like an adaptation of George Pal's film.  There are three main differences.  The nuclear catastrophe has been replaced by the Lunar mishap (no Cold War anymore).  The Eloi are less child-like.  The Morlocks are more like Verne's Selenites from FIRST MEN IN THE MOON.  Replacing the original Cold War fears was a good idea but its replacement was silly.  I approve of the new Eloi and Morlocks although they are further from Wells's original.  In the end the film has some parts that are better and some that are worse.  Having now seen the film I am not surprised at its poor performance.  It lacks the action and intensity that successful films of this genre usually have.  But it is not a bad film, just one that won't particularly appeal to the main body of movie goers.

B000002IVF|4.0|There was a time in rock and roll history-the mid to late 70's-when singer songwriters were releasing stuff that flew in the face of the current \\"chic\\" music movement-back then it was punk. (Think Jonathan Edwards, Emmylou Harris) These albums were probably not ever \\"hits.\\" They were not easily grasped on first listen. These-like Thousand Roads-took time to be digested. First you have to accept that this Crosby album isn't \\"If I Could Only Remember My Name\\" Crosby. This one should be taken on its own. Guess you can still say it sucks, but this reviewer likes it more every time.  Don't know about all the \\"comeback\\" talk here in these reviews. Fans will agree the Crosby doesn't need a \\"comeback\\"-he never left. Another album, another phase. If it was like \\"Name,\\" people would be complaining that he wasn't growing-so what are you gonna do? Forget the preconceived notions and enjoy this good music. If you are still looking for CSN&Y and \\"Name\\" sounds, the title track would sound great with Stills and Young battling in out. I think that Crosby can interpret a song well and I love him when he does his own stuff. You choose.

B00008BRBG|5.0|As a fan of the band waaaaaay back when I was in 10th grade (1980), I'm writing this review as the band experiences its renaissence ahead of its 30th  Anniversary World Tour.  Most will likely focus on the final recording \\"Synchronicity\\".  I prefer to start at the beginning. <br /> <br />Outlandos d'Amour landed quietly in the US as the second wave of punk-infuenced British bands began their invasion.  It's hard to remember, but The Police were contemporaries of Elvis Costello, The Sex Pistols, Buzzcocks, Ramones, and The Jam, and this album was released stateside at a time when Led Zeppelin, Pink Floyd, and The Who were the reigning Kings of British Rock.  No one knew it, but everything in music was about to change. <br /> <br />In contrast to the hyper-produced operatic sounds of mainstream FM \\"AOR\\" hard rock, the police were a spare, stripped-down, reggae-influence trio made up of a frenetic American drummer, and two Brits - both jazz afficionados.  Their sound captured the energy of the emerging punk scene, but if their arrangement seemed simple it was so only to let the elegant simplicity of their songcraft shine through. <br /> <br />Amidst the roar of British Arena rock, The Police landed in America, playing small clubs like NYC's now defunct CBGB, to even smaller audiences.  And while this was going on, like a hushed whisper -- a single song began climbing American radio charts.  A plaintive, tragic tale of a boy's idealistic love for a prostitute.  That song eventually became one of Rock music's most instantly recognized classics: Roxanne. <br /> <br />With that one song, The Police pried open the American radio audience and made way for the eventual torrent that became \\"New Wave\\".  As such, the band, and their debut album deserve recognition as a defining influence on the landscape of modern music, every bit as much as Nirvana  or The Beatle's for their seminal works. <br /> <br />There are few other memorable songs here that anyone other than an ardent fan would appreciate.  Other than Roxanne, only the tongue-in-cheek, suicidal break-up song \\"Can't Stand Losing You\\" ever made it into the US charts.  Still, the album flows pleasantly from start to finish, and the final cut \\"Mosoka Tanga\\", with its unintelligible lyrics, sets the listener up stylistically for the sophomore release (Regatta de Blanc) that eventually cemented the bands' now legendary success.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|Warning!!! This might be biased, since Gladiator is my favorite movie of all time. It was the first time I've seen a movie set in ancient times where the costumes didn't look like they were taken from a toga scene in a bad college movie.  The script, acting, and music work so well together, it sends the viewer along for an emotional roller coaster.  It is one of those movies where you guys might have to tell your wives/girlfriends that you have an eyelash to get out of your eye.  The battle scenes are amazing, a bit on the gory side, but is expected considering the subject matter.  The casting director should be given a promotion for his/her work here.  The special effects, concerning the recreation of ancient Rome in all of it's glory, are striking.  I found the extras worth watching.  It is the first time I actually sat down and watched a movie over again with just the commentary playing.  Russell Crowe points out a few bloopers that are still in the movie, which I found interesting.  If you watch the extras, you will be surprised by how hard it was to film the Proximo character, since Oliver Reed had passed away before filming was finished.    5 out of 5 and thumbs up to be sure!

0743289684|5.0|I agree with everyone who admires this book. I would add that it comes across as a rigorously honest account of Ayaan Hirsi Ali's life and experiences, and that there isn't the slightest trace of resentment in its pages. The author could have castigated those who made her suffer, down to her violent mother. Instead, she recounts as objectively as possible the events of her life, never casting a harsh judgment on anyone, just letting the facts speak for themselves, and even showing compassion for those who hurt her and providing excuses for their behavior. The most unbearably moving moment for me was the account of the death of Ayaan Hirsi Ali's sister. This is also a remarkably well written book, which must impress anyone who reads it. It's up to the readers to reach their own conclusions about the value of the message that it contains. Provided they keep an open mind, I cannot imagine it would be difficult to agree with the author's main points. Highly recommended, a must read, especially for anyone who is interested in learning more about some of the cultures in which Islam thrives.
B000FILW86|5.0|I am proud to say, I am one of the \\"originals\\", having discovered Cheap Trick  in 1978 as a 13 year old suburban kid days after hearing \\"Surrender\\" for the first time on radio.  To this day, when I think of that song, the line \\"Surrender, surrender, but don't give yourself away,\\" brings back all the non-conformist angst that drew me to the band almost 30 years ago.  These guys were, and are, my heroes.   <br /> <br />Despite mixed commercial success after the HUGELY influencial \\"Live at Budokan\\", I've always stuck by the original 4 members, who've always stuck by their love and respect for melodic guitar-driven songs.  This album is particularly for people who see the band like I do. <br /> <br />\\"Rockford\\" is certainly a tribute album, even if it didn't intend to be that way.  The title alone tells volumes about the band, in that its named for the small home-town in IL that nurtured them.  Just as the title brings them back to the beginning, so too do the songs -- tight, energetic, and as vital as anything the band put out on the now famous \\"first-five\\" (or the \\"Quint-essentials\\" as I like to call them).  Still more amazing...they sound every bit as good as they did 30 years ago.  They just refuse to get old, and go away quietly.  One of the reason's they are still my heroes. <br /> <br />Long-winded reviews bore me, and take up space from other contributors, so I'll summarize here.  Long-time fans will see their faith in the band restored with the best set of new material since \\"Lap of Luxury\\", possibly even \\"Dream Police\\".  People new to the band, who don't want to trip down memory lane will find a collection of tunes that hold their own with anything on the EMO charts today.  And anyone who has always believed in the power of a good hook, a strong back-beat, and a loud guitar to redeem their soul will hear this as both a revelation and epiphany.
0375505091|5.0|I bought this book for my 28 year old daughter.  She displays it in her studio apartment in Chicago.   <br />It is eclectic, modern, and beautiful.  Every page is breath-taking.
B000MGUZM0|5.0|In considering this album, one really can't appreciate it wholly without first having approached what has preceded it.  The character that this band has established over these last few years is certainly recognizable on this effort.  However, they seem to have come into adulthood in a rather strange way.  The lyrics on this album seem to be a subject of scrutiny, and I can certainly see most people's point.  They are a bit obvious in what they are attempting to put forth here.  However, there is a gravity lended to these words by the music.   <br /> <br />The song, Windowsill, is perhaps the biggest \\"offender\\" with its blatent use of \\"MTV\\" and references to our current war.  However, when I really think about it, it's the culmination of all these things that truly warrants such a piece.  The troubled children of \\"Funeral\\" are addressing the world today in \\"Neon Bible\\".   <br /> <br />When regarded as a whole, these lyrics are those of the most realistic dreamers I have ever heard.  The threatening non-violence of \\"Keep the Car Running\\" in it's imagining and obscure ideas about the impenetrability of the human soul in the face of this confusing life, for me, really sets the tone for the interpretation of this album.  Black Mirror, however, is sort of enigmatic.  More on that later. <br /> <br />Anyway, Neon Bible is amazing and you shouldn't miss it.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|After watching this latest version of my favorite classic, I have to say that this is the most sensuous telling of the story.  I loved the intense and very passionate relationship between Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson.  <br />I was so drawn into many of their scenes together, especially when Jane rescues Mr. Rochester from the firey bed.  I was mesmerized at the sight of him laying on the bed, his shirt unbuttoned, especially as past tellings of the story have always had Mr. Rochester in his high-buttoned Victorian era style bed clothes.  When Toby Stephens pulls Ruth Wilson to him, explaining that she had saved his life; the silence between them cuts through the room.   <br /> <br />As I described this version to someone, this is a contemporary version of a nineteenth century story.  It doesn't follow the book exactly, but it is an intense, compelling telling.
B000002KD9|5.0|The icon Neil Young solidified himself in the early to mid 70's and the funny thing is that he remains true to this album to this day despite all the semi forays into synthesized madness,noise,albums cut with Pearl Jam, and the styles of the day.<br /><br />The simplicity of this album as well as his prior 2, the few that followed are all 5 stars,it's laid back intimate sparse texture that fuses bittersweet tinged country ruminations with the great garage rock of Crazy horse was his formula and Neil's ongoing trademark of endurance.<br /><br />Nobody does it better, none of his musical children.<br /><br />I happily was front row in New York on his \\"Greendale\\" tour, saw that great\\"Rust Never Sleeps\\" tour,and followed and listen to him from the \\"Deja Vu\\" days onward and all you youngsters are best to start with these and should listen to Buffalo Springfield with his old buddy Steve Stills to see the development of this musician and the status he achieved with CSN&Y and beyond.

B000GBEWHA|2.0|Original Review:    I could never get the edition with the Leather Jacket as promised.  After contacting Amazon 3 times and sending back the same version 2 times without a Leather Jacket I gave up.  Even their customer service department said I would never get the correct selection.    I guess what you see isn't always what you get.  I'm sure the actual movie is fine.  I haven't opened it yet as I assume it is new and shouldn't have any scratches.  Maybe I should check that, too!      Follow-up Review:    Judy in Customer Service called me and said she made a special effort to track down a copy of Grease in a leather jacket for me and I could send them back the old one in exchange.  She was very kind and I give her Kudos for being so involved.  As promised, I got my Grease in the leather jacket and my husband is impressed with his gift!  I would give this 5 stars now, but it wouldn't let me change it.
0066620996|5.0|This book reads very much like reading a textbook however it is well worth the effort. The book have massive amounts of research to back their claims and make very valid comments that you can apply in a work setting.

0393057658|4.0|Much has been made of the statistical aspects of player evaluation.  This book gives those outside the walls of the baseball establishment an insight into the characters and creativity that one franchise has used to be competitive.  It is hard to disagree with the success that the analysis has provided.  The book sometimes wanders from the premise trying to give anecdotal stories about some of the colorful personalities within the game.  Overall though the book does what it set out to do.  It provides the reader with an alternative to the old school ways of player evaluation.  In the end it has made me rethink the preconceived notions I had of what the best approach would be for those teams who don't have the luxury of an unlimited checkbook.

0743289684|5.0|I recently had the good fortune to meet Ayaan Hirsi Ali at a Cato Institute conference, where she gave the closing night address.  While she spoke calmly from the podium, the image of grace under pressure, her bodyguards were strategically positioned around the room.  I was mid-way through Infidel then; I have since finished the book and handed it on--several copies, in fact--to members of my family.  I trust they will find, as I have, that this is an important and necessary book.  I judge the writing fluid, the story gripping, and the arguments clearly reasoned.  Above all, I am grateful that proponents of liberty like Hirsi Ali, however they are dismissed, reviled, or threatened, continue to speak out with courage and conviction.
B00005JOIH|1.0|I seldom watch movies since they are generally full of Hollywood nonsense, but this movie was the feature at a friend's home theater after dinner so I decided to watch.<br /><br />I don't know why I stayed all the way through, but the closing scene, with the World Trade Center towers superimposed in the background was the final straw for me. The acting was not nearly as bad as the hectoring and lecturing about the evils of revenge. There is no historical record that the people involved in tracking down the murderers of the Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972 had any second thoughts. This is especially true of Golda Meir, who saw that European governments were going to accommodate the latest band of Fascists known as Palestinian \\"Freedom fighters\\" but who are nothing but a band of murderers. I am sure her ghost will haunt Spielberg for this outrageous deceit.<br /><br />Spielberg reminds me of his relatives who encouraged their young children to get on the trains to the concentration camps, since they couldn't believe that those nice Gestapo men would do anything bad.<br /><br />I suppose when the Iranians deliver their nukes over Tel Aviv and wipe Israel off the Earth, he'll make another movie about how they were victims of American aggression, or some other such leftist nonsense.<br /><br />This movie is a fiction, based upon historical events, but subverted by Spielberg's instincts to let the bad guys continue to kill until they have done him in, too.<br /><br />Maybe he can donate some of his billions to the next annex to the Holocaust Museum in Washington when Israel disappears.<br /><br />This is one of the most dishonest and loathsome movies I have ever seen.
0143034901|4.0|\\"You mustn't tell anyone what you're about to see today.\\"<br /><br />So were the words of Daniel Sempere's father, a dealer in antiquarian books in brooding post-civil war Barcelona, when he introduces his young son to the esoteric Cemetery of Forgotten Books. There he has his young son `rescue' any book he wishes, from a lifetime of neglect. \\"The Shadow of the Wind\\", the boy's selection, was written by author, Julian Carax, purported to have enigmatically perished in a duel shrouded in ambiguity.<br /><br />As Daniel grows into a young man, he becomes obsessed with the book and it's mystifying author. He also comes to the realization that Carax's books are conspicuously starting to disappear -- a mysterious cloaked collector has been buying them up and setting them ablaze, one by one...and he has made it very clear that he is after Daniel's copy too.<br /><br />Daniel enlists the assistance of Ferm&iacute;n Romero de Torres -- an erudite vagrant who just happens to be a former Republican emissary -- in piecing together the story of Carax's life, which turns out to be a superbly macabre Gothic-style epic. As a result, Daniel and Ferm&iacute;n are thrust into the middle of a perilous escapade as they struggle to avoid the perils of a psychopathic fascist agent.<br /><br />Some brilliant passages induced comparisons to Gabriel Garc&iacute;a M&aacute;rquez or Arturo Perez-Reverte, whereas others occasionally read like a melodramatic over-sensationalized screenplay (which makes sense, as Zafon is a former screenwriter). Zafon's use of comical relief in Ferm&iacute;n Romero de Torres is effective in offsetting the story's oftentimes far-fetched intensity.<br /><br />Nonetheless, despite all its flaws, Ruiz Zafon's post Spanish Civil War thriller will indubitably entertain.
B0002YLC24|5.0|This movie is an unexpected sequence for the lovely Before Sunrise and a great surprise for its fans! The characters reunite in another incredible setting: a beautiful Paris in summertime! They walk through charming and not obvious places in Paris, they chat about their lives and what they have done since their first meeting in Vienna 10 years before... And they discover that they have important things in common about their feelings about each other and about what could have happened if things have occurred in a different way 10 years before... <br />It is a beautiful view of how few moments can be so strong and present in our lives! And that we should strive to make these moments last forever... <br />I can't wait to the third sequence!!!     <br />
1593080255|4.0|This is the question I kept asking myself as I read through Oscar Wilde's book. The narrative is characteristic of the author's flamboyant nature and readers will find certain descriptions a little uncanny. Overall, this is an interesting story, written with purpose and to me this was the most important thing. Although the moral of the story has been copied over by many other authors (with slight variations), the dilemma remains the same - is one willing to sacrifice his internal peace for the price of the eternal beauty? The best answer to this question is a quote from Thomas Wolfe: \\"The surest cure for vanity is loneliness.\\"<br /><br />- by Simon Cleveland

1552091090|4.0|A very moving book.  It reminds me of an onion, in that, as a child grows up, they can reread the story, and come away with a different perspective every time.  Right now, my 4 year old thinks it's a story about a naughty boy whose mommy still loves him, even though he is bad.  Later she will understand the ideas of unconditional love, the cycles of life, mother/child bonds, etc. <br /> <br />I believe that those people who called it creepy read the book more  literally than was intended.  I hope we can all agree that it is a bad idea to climb into the window of a house that does not belong to you in the dead of night...um, right?  (Gosh, I hope my mother in law is reading this!) <br /> <br />Just kidding mom!   <br /> <br />Seriously, this is not a silly story, and not even a simple story, but it is a good story.  I would read it yourself first, to anticipate any of the tough questions your kids might have for you...it is definitely thought-provoking. <br /> <br />
B00001ZULV|1.0|The hits are there, but if you want the best, search somewhere else <br />because the best tracks on Genesis's albums haven't been heard on radio. <br />For instance, the best cut of Duke is Duke's travel -  Duke's end, so what you have on this cd...of course Turn it on again and Misunderstanding. <br />Another example maybe ? The best on \\"Genesis\\" album is Home by the sea - Second home by the sea, so what you have on this cd ? Of course, you get Mama and That's all.

0385504209|1.0|Reviewer Steven Reynolds sums it up nicely, but since I write these reviews primarily for my own benefit, I can't rely on his words to describe my experience.<br /><br />So here are my words: a gruesome murder and its symbolic aftermath; a rock star of a Harvard symbologist who can't recognize the Star of David as two intersecting triangles; two-page chapters flying past, with every other chapter returning to our hero the rock star symbologist; 450 pages in two sessions of roughly 3 hours each; character development, what character development?; albino assassin working for Catholic conspirators, Priory of Sion conspirators, Templar conspirators; the Holy Grail; Mary Magadalene and Jesus; the exact same double-bluff tricks from Angels and Demons with bad guys as good guys as bad guys; and it all ends in such an unsatisfying way.<br /><br />Perhaps I would be willing to give Dan Brown a free pass on this if this novel weren't so darned successful. I don't resent the success per se. Instead I despise the fact that this author has managed to stir up so much controversy (and so many revenues) without actually understanding the material he's writing about. For a novel that purports to be an intellectual tour de force, this book is filled with errors even a college freshman with Wikipedia could catch. (Example: Brown actually has a character assert that the name \\"YHWH\\" derives from the name \\"Jehovah,\\" when in fact the reverse is the case.) Every time \\"Harrison Ford in tweed\\" discussed the mysterious organizations, themes, and locales that run throughout the book---whether Saint-Sulpice, Rosslyn Chapel, the Priory of Sion, etc.---my mind would scream out for someone on Langdon's dissertation commitee to call and revoke his degree. The Priory of Sion was exposed as a 20th century hoax, yet Brown insists on telling readers in his introductory \\"fact\\" note that this demonstrated forgery was a secret society founded in 1099. His characters, allegedly renowned scholars no less, recite their conspiracy theories like stoned undergraduates at a late night party shocking one another with earnestly repeated urban legends. After a while, the college stoner conspiracy crap lost its charm, and by the time the end of the book was approaching, I realized that the author had already shot his main goods in the chapter on Jesus and Mary Magdalene as lovers. THAT was the controversy that made this book sell. THAT was the real secret of the book, and not the farcical Grail that Langdon pursues until the very last page. Revealing to a world of Christians that their religion was bound up in the vagaries and contingencies of history, and that there are aspects to this religion that have been lost or hidden, made for controversy and good sales.<br /><br />This could have been a much better book, even a great book, in the hands of a real writer and researcher. As it is, The Da Vinci Code is merely the scandalously popular and criminally overrated work of a mediocre, hamfisted hack.s, recite their conspiracy theories like stoned undergraduates at a late night party shocking one another with earnestly repeated urban legends.

B000000ZGO|5.0|Way before Isaac played Chef on the sometimes funny, mostly smug sitcom South Park, and before he flipped out on Scientology, he made some of the greatest soul albums of all time.  This is the one I consider his best.  It's only got 4 tracks on it, but they are all gorgeous.  Isaac has a great sense of narrative, and this is demonstrated the best in the song By the Time I Get to Phoenix.  It runs 18:40, but he needs every minute of that to tell the story behind the song.  The actual song doesn't begin until about half way through it.  A lot of people like Isaac's Shaft soundtrack, but I never really dug it.  This album, Movement, and Joy are my favorites.  Issac Hayes is a lot like the group War, in that he's what I call progressive soul music (who actually opened for him on some tours).  Albums with long, complicated arrangements, but with a ton of soul.  That's Isaac.  That's War.  And this is a great album....

His ranting went on for nearly 100 pages, then he goes on to talk about the fall of societies that were doomed from the start. I could have made the analysis that he made about the specific societies that he picked. Personally I was dissipointed that he did not get into  idealistic reasons why some societies fail. I would have liked to see more about why very technilogically advanced societies failed throughout history.

I know its mostly for kids but hey I am a kid at heart and I loved it. I know you and your family will truly enjoy this movie over and over again. I give it 5plus stars.
B0000AYJXR|5.0|Even with the technology of recent animated films, Space Jam still holds it ground as one of the best. It combines great animation with the classic humor of Looney Tunes. This film is great for basketball lovers of all ages because it includes humor for both kids and adults. This film is also a must have for any Michael Jordan Fan. An all-around awesome film. <br /> <br />The dual-disk is entertaining, especially if you enjoy looney tunes cartoons which are included in the special features. The behind the scenes and commentary are interesting and informing. Good if you are interested in animation or film making. The special features includes two music videos: Seal's \\"Fly like and Eagle\\" and The Monstar's Theme by a selection of rappers from the era. It does not include R. Kelly's video for \\"I Believe I can Fly.\\" <br /> <br />
0446528056|5.0|I have read all of Nicholas Sparks books and this one is as good as the first. He is the type of author that you just can't stop reading his books are very hard to put down. The way he captured the loneliness of the gulf war was wonderful. It gives you a new view on things and helps you to see how heartbreaking it can really be. And what the true meaning of love and sacarfice. I won't give away the plot but I will say this it is a truly good book and I know if you start reading it you won't be able to put it down. I give this book a 5 plus stars and more.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Ruth Wilson and Toby Stephens star in a wonderful new adaptation of Jane Eyre.  I wasn't sure what to expect, but the acting is close to brillant... Toby's new take on Rochester is enough to make any Jane fall for him.  Ruth Wilson is a perfect, timid, Jane, and the passion between the two plays well.  The pace of the movie matches the gothic tone that the book delivers.  This four-hour production is very faithful to the original novel; any Charlotte Bronte fan would love this adaptation.
B0007PAMR4|5.0|I have seen this movie several times and every time I watch it just gets better and better. Its a great movie with alot of fantastic special effects and one of the best sci-fi's ever. I highly recommend this movie to everyone its worth watching.
0743289684|4.0|No matter where your opinion lies on the subject or if you have no opinion at all you should pick up a copy of Ayaan Hirsi Ali's \\"Infidel\\".  The story of the strength of this woman and other like her who must endure such trials and cruelties is both heart-wrenching and hope building.  We as a society should stand up for each other and what Ayaan is doing for the women of her country is both commendable and heroic.  It is easy to watch and say nothing, it is harder to stand up and fight for what is right. This is not about saying a culture is wrong, but about saying that a culture is misunderstood and misinterpreted even by its own people.
B00004TWZF|5.0|I have seen the other version of the big blue and there was alot of empty spaces in it key parts of the movie that made it hard to understand. But the directors cut filled in those empty spaces and made those scenes they left out more understandable. The directors cut is a much better version of the movie and if you have never seen this movie before I recommend you see this version first. The music was much better in the first version I do have to say that. It was more mysterious and comforting in the other version this one was to upbeat it was more like disco to me. I loved the characters Jean Reno is one of my favorite actors. Im not sure why Jean Marc Barr's career didnt take off I thought he was wonderful in this movie.Rosanna Arquette well she was ok but I think they could have casted her part a lot better with someone else. All she did in this movie was giggle and scream to the top of her lungs. She was like listening to fingers nails going down a chalk board. My appologies to all the Rosanna Arquette fans I didnt mean to offend. It was a great movie and throughly enjoyed it and would highly recommend it to anyone. I would give it a 5 plus.
B000G759LW|5.0|What can I say about someone who can sing today using the basics of yesterday. WOW. You will listen again and again.
B00007L4OM|5.0|I have seen this movie twice and it is a very funny movie. I am a big fan of Jean Reno I have seen almost every movie he has stared in and every movie of his is great. I highly recommend this film to anyone that likes action and humor combined.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|I bought both CD's for my son...He loves PoC...movies, music and toys.  He is 5 years old.  He listens to the music and can tell you the part of the story it comes from.  Its' loaded in the car and much nicer to listen to than the usual kid music.  The CD's are different and engaging enough so you don't feel like you bought the same thing twice.  With each album you will have favorites.  My son does, I do... we like them.
B000002JAX|5.0|This lady is wonderful her music takes you away to another place and time its an wonderful escape. I throughly enjoyed this cd its very relaxing and her voice is that of an angel. I highly recommend it to everyone who is a fan of beautiful Jazz.
B000H8RWEM|5.0|I was surprised at how good this album actually is.  At the time of its release Elton Dean had left a new Karl Jenkins had entered the fold.  Robert Wyatt and Phil Howard were gone replaced now by John Marshall.  Half of this album are live tracks recorded at the very begining of this lineup the other half is a studio album.  Both are transitional in that the live material show how fast karl Jenkins had taken control of the band.  Hugh Hopper playing is fantastic sadly this would be his last album he would record with the Softs.   The studio section show a new direction of what the band had they developed more with Hugh Hoppper gone into.   This would be one of the last great classic Soft Machine albums ... Seven while good was written very hastly and the compostions were never developed properly.  Shortly after the release of this album and prior to the release of Seven a rumor circulated that Soft Machine Members were to join up with John McLaughlin one can argue how good or bad that would have been.  Most fans of Soft Machine will enjoy six a soild affair and a classic.  This particular reissue sound quality is very good.  I am comparing this to the One way  release.  The sound improvement is in the hiss and general brightness of the recording.  It pretty much a wash if you have the japanese import copy.  Each one of the reissues come with pretty much the same artwork and booklet adding information to each reissue.
B000M341QO|4.0|This is a present day cops, gangs, crime and corruption type of film.   It's been done many times but the genre always entertains. And the subject matter always includes violence and profanity.     It's a Martin Scorsese (film director) remake of the 2002 Hong Kong thriller \\"Infernal Affairs\\". I have no criticisms of Scorsese's version since I haven't seen the original. But if you're not willing to let this movie take you to South Boston with these characters, you won't like the film.    When Leo's character got knocked around, and Mark's character berated Leo's and when Matt's character was sweating bullets to try to save his skin again, I felt like I was in Boston beside each one. Even though there are a few weak moments in the movie. It took me there so I liked it.     Leo (Leonardo DiCaprio) did a great job playing the under dog. Matt Damon is great. After seeing him in \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\", I new he could play the despicable type.  Mark (Wahlberg) and Jack (Nicholson) were exceptional too.     I was surprised some were offended by the language in this type of film.   I didn't hear anymore profanity then I'd hear on the Soprano's or The Wire.       The cursing in The Departed is used for camaraderie or frustration which I think is normal for the roles portrayed and the genre.   Some may have run out to see it because the film received Oscar nominations without knowing the subject matter.    I would suggest some of the other Oscar nominated films instead of \\"The Departed\\" if this type of movie is not something you'd normally choose.    \\"The Devil Wears Prada\\",Genres: Comedy, Drama, PG13 (Oscar nominated leading Actress and Costume Design) ,\\"The Illusionist\\", Genres: Drama, Mystery, Romance Thriller, PG13 (nominated for Cinematography), \\"Marie Antoinette\\", Genres: Biography, Drama, History, PG13 (nominated for Costume Design), \\"The Prestige\\", Genres: Drama, Fantasy, Thriller, PG13 (nominated for Art Direction and Cinematography), \\"The Queen\\", Genres: Biography, drama, PG13 (Nominated for Leading Actress, Costume Design, Directing, Best Picture, Music, Original Screenplay).

B00005V1Y0|4.0|This is a great movie with some wonderful dancing.  It was early in the career for Baz but definatly has his trademark movie making style.
1400064287|5.0|It's hard to teach someone how to be creative, but this book seems to simplify that process very well by engaging the reader in stories that stimulate the brain to stretch itself a bit to grasp the concepts of \\"sticky\\" ideas.  It turns out that some of the most creative \\"sticky\\" ideas are quite simple in reality, and that's the beauty of Chip and Dan's masterpiece.<br /><br />A highly recommended title to add to your library if you're searching for ways to stand out in the crowd without being gimmicky, do something profound that people will remember for years, become remarkable, or grow your business via creative approaches that people can relate to easily.
B000J3OTSM|5.0|I gave this movie 5 stars for the dancing.  It is amazing!  I think Channing Tatum will grow to be a fine actor but the female lead...Jenna Dewan leaves a lot to be desired.  If you like dance movies I think you'll enjoy this one.  It is a fine blend of Hip-hop and Ballet.
0596007124|4.0|This book is written in a playful style and uses a lot of clip art and kooky fonts, and these put me off at first. But the book addresses a complex and difficult-to-understand subject, and it soon won me over. The examples are straightforward, and illustrate the patterns in a way that is easy to understand. The code examples are in Java but the concepts are easily applied to other languages (I am a Flash developer myself). The style might be cheesy at times, but it helped me learn the patterns in a direct and concrete way. Well done.
B00000JG41|5.0|'California' is definately a very different item in the Mr. Bungle catalouge. The unnervingly demented experimentation of 'Disco Volante' is watered down, and the unhinged, derranged circus vibe of the first self-titled release is completely gone with the exception of a couple of songs. So what makes this one a hit? What makes 'California' stand out?<br /><br />'California' is by far the most listenable of the Bungle albums. Before you potential Bungle-heads (If you are a true Bungle-head you already own this) turn an run at the word 'listenable', please understand what I mean. Mr. Bungle truly reached their musical potential with this album. Rather than focusing on extreme and random noises, Mike Patton shows us that even though still delightfully bizzare and unconventional, he is a truly magnificant vocalist capable of carrying a very melodic and captivating tune. Matching Mike's more melodic vocal style, 'California' soars above most experimental music with soothing melodies, and well executed atmosphere. This more melodic and less nonsense approach is obviously going to make the music more 'listenable', but fear not, 'California' still visits every corner of the musical spectrum. With styles from salsa, to metal, to surf, 'California' is still unmistakably a Mr. Bungle release.<br /><br />By far the most 'musical' (in the traditional sense) Mr. Bungle album, 'California' is a perfect place to start if you are new to the band, and is an essentual piece to any avant-garde musicians' collection.
B000M5AJQI|3.0|This was a pretty good movie but I wasn't wowed by it or anything. Especially since the story is not original and The Departed is actually a remake of a Hong Kong film that came out first.<br /><br />Also the Boston accents were annoying. Since we know these actors don't normally speak with an accent, having them twalk like thwat seemed very contrived.<br /><br />I bought this DVD thinking it was going to be great but was disappointed. I don't feel like I want to own it, I should have rented it instead.

0439813786|5.0|The Invention of Hugo Cabret, by Brian Selznick, is a children's novel weighing in at an intimidating 533 pages, but the reader brave enough to dive headlong into its pages will find a multi-layered text that consists of not only a delightfully written tale, but rich illustrations that take over the telling of the story at regular intervals. Selznick's creation navigates the grey area between picture book and graphic novel in what certainly constitutes a visual and narrative achievement and a truly original book.    Hugo is a 12-year-old boy strapped with responsibility beyond that which a child should have to shoulder. After his uncle--a hopeless drunk in charge of tending the station's clocks--disappears, Hugo takes it upon himself to maintain the clocks in hopes that his uncle won't be missed and he can keep his dwelling and enjoy the freedom of coming and going, living within the walls, and repairing an artifact cherished by both Hugo and his late father. The artifact at the center of the tale is a forgotten automaton discovered among the dust and rot of a museum storage room. It is a mechanical man, pen in hand, poised to deliver a message; Hugo feels certain that if he can repair the automaton by using his late father's notes, the mechanical man will write a message from beyond the grave. Hugo resorts to stealing toys from the toy booth in the train station, and soon finds himself working off his debt to the shopkeeper, a man with secrets of his own. What follows involves a stolen notebook, an oddly familiar drawing, unlikely friends, the magic of silent film, and a giant in cinema, Georges Melies (the most recognizable of his films being A Trip to the Moon or Le Voyage dans la Lune, 1902).    While the novel largely defies categorization, it closely resembles a silent film in many respects, and fittingly so. In addition to the novel's rich illustrations, Selznick employs photos and movie stills to show the reader his story as opposed to simply telling it. Inthe tradition of graphic narrative (or sequential art, whatever your term of choice), the illustrations play as integral a role in the overall story as the text. The use of illustrations is hardly gratuitous, for the pictures quite literally take over and carry out the narrative when the text disappears. And, really, who would care if the illustrations were gratuitous? They're gorgeous.    The Invention of Hugo Cabret is full of magic...for the child reader, for the adult reader, the film lover, the art lover, for anyone willing to give it a go. If you're scared of the size or the concept, don't be. Open your mind, pour Selznick's creation in, and be reminded of the dream of childhood.

0060594896|5.0|I never was greatly fond of the Chicken Soup series--they were too Reader's Digesty to me. But this book is different. I was finally persuaded by high recommendations from several friends at once.

Then after the veil of darkness is finally lifted at last I  suggest this book next for fine- tuning a new way of life.
0790729393|5.0|Man, with this cast you really could have blown the roof off the house. I mean, all the national treasures of acting are here -- except for Kevin Spacey, Tommy Lee Jones, Will Smith, Martin Lawrence, John Travolta, Tim Allen and Carlos Mencia.<br /><br />The kids were really annoying, right? How many astonished close-ups of them were we gonna get? Get over it. Big deal, a prison guard did some bad things to you. They acted like it didn't happen to everyone.<br /><br />Dustin Hoffman is a national gem. He get so into character that sometimes he forgets to get back into Dustin. At least, that's all I can think -- because I saw him in Manhattan and I kept yelling, \\"Hey Dustin, want to go get a hot cocoa and some Buggles (crunchy corn snacks)?\\" But he acted as if he didn't hear me -- must of been deep into his character, yes?
B000H5U832|5.0|I'm not one to watch animated DVD's over and over but this one is worth repeating! Love it, love it, love it!
0143034545|2.0|Key points: <br /> <br />1. One should read Allen's \\"Getting Things Done\\" (GTD) before reading \\"Ready for Anything\\" (RFA).   <br /> <br />2. If you've read GTD, you can probably skip RFA.  It reinforces some core GTD principles, often in a mind-numbingly repetitive fashion (which can be a good teaching style), but also tries to fill in some of \\"The Vision Thing\\" content absent in GTD.  Unfortunately, Covey is better than Allen in addressing \\"The Vision Thing.\\"  Together, GTD plus Covey's \\"7 Habits\\" and \\"First Things First\\" (FTF) make an interesting collection.   <br /> <br />3. RFA suffers from the same design and layout issues I found with GTD: the \\"inspirational quotations\\"  in the margins destroy the reading flow as they push into the space occupied by the main text.  The quotes distract the reader from the main text due to their intrusion into such and a lack of white space. IMO, there are too many inspirational quotes.  Allen should have simply started each chapter with one relevant quote, ala Covey's \\"7 Habits...\\"  I've noticed that some of the inspirational quotes are recycled from GTD and are sometimes better than the associated essay in RFA.  To see how to place quotes or references in the margins of a book's pages, Allen should review any of Edward Tufte's books, such as \\"Beautiful Evidence.\\"   <br /> <br />4. There are obvious parallels throughout RFA to ideas in Covey's \\"7 Habits\\" and \\"First Things First.\\"  However, there's no mention of Covey in the book (and he's only cited once in GTD via an inspirational quote).  Both Covey and Allen have interesting things to teach, but it seems Allen eschews any reference to Covey despite the obvious parallels to anyone who has read both authors.  In some cases, it seems Allen is taking pot-shots at Covey ideas, such as his reference to the \\"quadrant matrix\\" on page 22 of the paperback edition of RFA, an obvious reference to Covey's Urgent/Important matrix in FTF. <br /> <br />5. RFA makes no attempt to indicate when the included essays were originally published in Allen's newsletter.  It would be interesting to know when the original essay was published.  I'm sure they've been edited and updated for the book, but some connection to their stated original publication dates might be helpful in understanding where Allen was in his personal journey at the time he wrote the essay. <br /> <br />6. The \\"By the way...\\" items at the end of each RFA chapter may be valuable for readers who've not yet asked themselves some of the deeper questions or who are struggling with their GTD implementation. <br /> <br />7. IMO, the GTD Workflow chart, in a revised form in RFA, still needs work.  Perhaps they should not try to fit it on one page: use a two-page spread or, even better, a fold-out that one can also tear out.  The chart would benefit from the help of someone who knows how to draw flowcharts. <br /> <br />8. The paper in the paperback edition of  RFA is of a cheap, inferior quality compared to that used in the paperback edition of GTD.  To me, it feels like cheap newsprint. <br /> <br />9. RFA lacks an index.  A book like this, without an index, is most unfortunate, indicating perhaps a rush job to capitalize on GTD interest by recycling old essays.  Recycling content for additional profit is a good idea, but any book like this should include an index.
B0002HMQUS|5.0|Manfrotto makes hi-end tripods and monopods, and ball heads... and foot spikes... and, well, you get the idea. Though this monopod isn't the most expensive out there, it's certainly high-quality and quite handsome-looking. it's not carbon fiber, but it's not too heavy, either. right out of the box, you can tell it's well-made. it has one main shaft and two telescoping sections. fully extended with tilt head attached, it comes up to my chin--i'm 6/2\\"--and the quick-release locks don't wobble at all, but appear quite sturdy.<br /><br />How sturdy? Well it's sturdy enough to be used as a walking stick in alpine conditions, as i recently found out when i shot a snowboard event in lake tahoe. i took the gondola to the top of a hill at northstar, and had to walk downhill to where the event was taking place. the slope was a bit steep, and without the manfrotto, it would have been much more difficult, if not suicidal; with it, i could poke into the snow and see how deep it was before stepping forward. the adjustable handle strap was designed for gear-lashing but comfortably and securely will fit around a gloved hand, while the padded grip not only offers comfort but insulates in cold climates. i suspect it'd be just as useful hiking in non-alpine conditions as well. and it could even be a lifesaver in urban or travel situations too, since it makes for a mean cudgel or staff if someone tries to punk you for your camera.<br /><br />in many ways, the monopod makes more sense than a tripod since it's easier to carry and more collapsable. who wants to lug a tripod in their backpack? the downside vs. a tripod is obvious: it's not great for really long exposures (since you still have to hold it) unless you have a remote or cable and/or can brace it against something, but then manfrotto does offer some add-on support extensions if this is a big concern. it comes with a tilt head, basic yet solid, which appears to be sturdier than just the screw on the base of the 'pod. i know, it's not a ball head, but you can always upgrade, right? not much more to say about it other than it's not overpriced considering what you get for the money. for outdoorsy photographers the 'pod is a must, and this manfrotto doesn't dishonor their rep., it's not a ball head, but you can always upgrade, right? not much more to say about it other than it's not overpriced considering what you get for the money. for outdoorsy photographers the 'pod is a must, and this manfrotto doesn't dishonor their rep.
B000FS9FCQ|5.0|Life begins after you die.  The creator of the Matrix series does it even better with V For Vandetta, a future world being a product of our current follies.

B000062X90|5.0|Argus is Wishbone Ashes masterpiece. They never bettered it. The best example I know of for crystal clear twin-lead (Gibson ans Fender) guitars-way ahead of it's time. Their vocals also never sounded better. One of life's mysteries is why The Ash never continued in this direction? They followed up with 'Wishbone Four', which is great, but pales next to this gem. Every home should have a copy. Over the years  I have had 3 LPs, 2 tapes, 2 eight-track tapes (wore them all out. I had the older master of the cd, now I have this remixed cd and it is absolutely stunnig in clarity----Bravo! Buy it, you need it--pioneering English rock from the early seventies.
B000LXHK2C|4.0|In a change-of-pace from the heavy dramatics and CGI-heavy spectacle that Russell Crowe and director Ridley Scott offered up, in \\"Gladiator\\", the warmly romantic \\"A Good Year\\" shows a charm and humor that should make this film a favorite of fans of a good love story and the beauty of Provence, for years to come!<br /><br />Based on Peter Mayle's 2006 novel, which, in turn, was loosely based his 1993 work, \\"A Year in Provence\\", the film is reminiscent of Diane Lane's 1993 comedy/drama, \\"Under the Tuscan Sun\\", and also brings to mind the 1961 Rock Hudson/Gina Lollobrigida comedy, \\"Come September\\"; all three films offer romance, a glowing Mediterranean atmosphere, and characters as unconventional as they are, endearing.<br /><br />Crowe is a high-power, unscrupulous but wickedly funny British investment broker, who inherits the French estate and vineyards of his late uncle (Albert Finney, who plays the endearing codger in flashbacks). Under investigation for a more-than-a-little-shady stock transaction, the trip to France gives the broker a chance to let things simmer down, while he unloads the property...but childhood memories, old friends, the arrival of an unknown, illegitimate heir, from America (Abbie Cornish), and a feisty, beautiful local French girl (Marion Cotillard) all conspire to force Crowe to rethink his priorities, as he falls under the spell of Provence.<br /><br />While the film offers few real surprises, the characters are all likable, the dialog is crisp and witty, and there is a tangible magic in the glorious French landscape.<br /><br />All-in-all, \\"A Good Year\\" makes a GREAT date movie, and may have you booking a trip to France!
B00005MCX0|5.0|Worth the price of admision for the 2 tracks-'You shouldn't do that', and \\"Master od the universe'. Absolute masterpieces. Firsy track clocks in at over 15 minutes and I never get tired of it. Sensational feel, full of synths, sound generators, hippy vocals, all backed by solid drumming and Rickenbacker bass (Dave Anderson,-whatever happened to him?)-superb line up! A must have for any Hawkwind fan. Forget about the rip-off compilations and live stuff-get this, and the later 'Electric Tepee'
B000MXPE74|4.0|Listeners turned on by the Fratellis' song \\"Flathead,\\" featured on an iTunes TV ad, will be amply rewarded if they check out the full length Frats CD, Costello Music.  It's chock full of exuberant tracks that have the energy at a very high level.  This would be tremendous party music if you want the people dancing!  I'm also thinking this would be a a great bunch to see live - something I hope to be able to do soon.  Of all the comparisons people have made of this band with their ancestors (some pretty strange comparisons -- Led Zep??), the ones that seem most apt to me are the Clash (minus the protest element) and Stray Cats.
B000LC55F2|4.0|There are some wild stories about Testla, including one that he was responsible for the Tunguska Event in Siberia, where it is claimed that Testla was trying to signal Peary on his way to the North Pole with his Wardenclyffe Tower, \\"death ray.\\"  <br /> <br />Anyway, a couple problems with this film: one is that it spends a great deal of time setting you up by exposing the crude, cruel truths behind many magic tricks; another is that it continually cuts back and forth between the past and the present and the future. While everyone gets the Fallon-Bordon Twin connection quickly, I wonder how many reviewers got the significance of the meadow filled with top hats shown at the start of the film, and the cat/cats, and the warning about the Tesla machine, and the blind stage hands? Basically, the film was too clever by half. Probably, it gets too hard for most viewers to make the wild conceptual leap about the machine and Testla, as not even Testla could create a machine that does the impossible. We do understand Twins, however.
B000F7OPCC|5.0|By far, \\"Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade\\" is my favorite film of the trilogy. This movie is just absolutely enjoyable to watch from start to finish. Indy is back chasing a religious artifact that a widespread audience can appreciate, battling the Nazis across the skies and desert, and the woman is not the annoying, scream fest of \\"The Temple of Doom.\\" In particular, I enjoyed two aspects of this film. First, it provides an explanation for many aspects of Indiana Jones's character. For example, we receive background information of Indy's youth, providing an explanation for why he chose the field of archaeology to begin with. Why does Indiana Jones have Harrison Ford's famous chin scar? Why is he named \\"Indiana?\\" Where did he get his hat and bullwhip? All of these questions are answered and fleshed out in this film. Secondly, and more importantly, I enjoyed seeing the interaction between Harrison Ford and Sean Connery. It was very nice to see the father/son relationship and development throughout the movie. In the first two movies, Indy's character is rather flat and uninteresting. In \\"Last Crusade,\\" however, we finally get to see his character come alive and develop.<br /><br />On top of all the action in this film, the music score is fantastic and really adds depth to the film. The comedy in this film is also immense; \\"Last Crusade\\" definitely has a lot of fun. The scene in which Indiana fends off the Nazis on a motorbike, while his father does nothing but frown is classic and cannot be missed. If you haven't seen this film, just go see it. It's that simple.
B0000047CX|5.0|Much has been said about this disc over the past nearly 45 years since it's recording and here at Amazon; mostly all positive here as the 136 reviews averaging five stars can testify to. I listened to this LP many years, off and on since it's original release and recently purchased the CD version so I may take it anywhere on my I-Pod. It goes without saying it is essential music. The understated vibe whispers classic. The pairing of Getz and Gilberto seems as natural and beautiful as sunsets on the beach on Rio de Janeiro. The soft sensual vocals of Joao and Astrud Gilberto pair well with the robust yet minimilist sax work Stan Getz to create an exquisite recording. The contribution by Antonio Carlos Jobim on piano cannot be overlooked as he helped create the total ambience. Soft romantic melodies results from the joining of these two forces in their respective fields to create the definitive bossa nova sound. The model for which bossa nova has been defined by is the quintessential \\"The Girl From Ipanema\\" features the famous duet by husband and wife Astrud and Joao Gilberto that is complimented by the cool tenor sax work by Getz twice on this disc;included is the 45rpm issue that was popular on the airwaves during the time period.It is ironic that Gilberto and Antonio Carlos Jobim did not want her to sing on what has become arguably one of the most recognized bossa nova songs ever recorded. The total recording is a reflection of a turbulent time in the world when peaceful music waft down from Sugarloaf mountain for the world to take notice and they have never stopped noticing. Maybe in our contemporay world of war and chaos we need more of the peaceful vibe of the bossa nova again. If you have never experienced this classic recording, check it out,it does still sound good after all these years. Recommended for jazz and Brazilian music enthusiasts.
B000001DTM|5.0|I'm sure I'll get railed for suggesting the 90's were a bad decade for rock music.  I'm equally sure that fans of 90's rock will get on me for suggesting a darling of the 80's, U2, had one of the decade's best performances.  But sorry folks - it is what it IS!<br /><br />The opening riffs of \\"Zoo Station\\" are still amazing to me - other rock artists dream of coming up with a song opening as cool as this one, rooted in a seemingly lost twang of guitar fuzz, then turning into an infectious dance beat and finally coming together in a great tin-tinged Bono vocal.  What the song lacks in substance, is made up for in its' amazing style.  Then when we get into the real songs - the dark edge of \\"Even Better Than The Real Thing\\", the heavy fuzz of the album version of \\"Who's Gonna Ride Your Wild Horses\\" and the sharp heavy pop of \\"Mysterious Ways\\" - we can see how the band's style had evolved while the lyrical form and musical composition remained tight.<br /><br />The showcase moment - which U2 itself didn't expect at all - is the simple, gospel-heavy \\"One\\", with it's simple call for unity.  To this day, this song is the one (pardon the pun) that has given Bono his identity as he works for the eradication of worldwide poverty and disease. In a way, this song - and this entire album - feels like a tribute to John Lennon, with \\"One\\" as their version of \\"Imagine\\".<br /><br />All in all - another defining moment for one of the 20th century's greatest musicians.  It ranks a mere notch below \\"The Joshua Tree\\" - but it's still well up the ladder from the best work of U2's contemporaries.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This is a amazing \\"prequel\\", showing us how Bond got his 00 status, and revealing the source of other classic Bond accoutrements.  Daniel Craig is as natural as a gun to a bullet as Bond, giving a steely yet vulnerable performance, the likes of which have not been seen since Connery. If you prefer the more genteel, cultured Bond, this may not be your cup of tea, but if you like the Fleming novels or have been pining for the day when a great Bond film finally makes the screen, this is IT. <br />The torture sequence is not for the faint of heart- this was my wife's one big issue with the film, as she felt it went too far and was difficult to watch. Maybe, but you came away connected to James as never before.
B000001FA4|3.0|U2 was dealing with a lot at this point in their career.  After becoming the darlings of critics all over the world with \\"October\\", they responded with a huge triumph on 1983's \\"War\\", quickly becoming major superstars, particularly in Europe.  For their next album, though, they were facing multiple pressures.  Their label certainly wanted their success to advance;  but the band was committed to a concept album celebrating the life of Dr. Martin Luther King.<br /><br />The results remain uneven to this date.<br /><br />\\"Pride\\" is the showcase of this album and a staple today, a frank and specific showcase of Dr. King; the title track and \\"MLK\\" also are direct references to the civil rights leader.  But the album's reamining tracks are muddy and seem to wander a bit.  My feeling to this day is that the band's subsequent efforts such as \\"The Joshua Tree\\" and \\"Achtung Baby\\" would not have worked as well as they did without the commitment to experiment that is evident throughout this album.  The results of their forays are not immediately apparent when you listen to \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\" - but it would be in the 20 years to come.
B000002P72|5.0|recorded live at the regal theatre, chicago in 1964, this is generally considered b.b. king's best album, and deservedly so. this is simply one of the great urban blues albums of all-time. b.b.'s singing is as powerful and nuanced on this recording as it was ever to be, before or after. his guitar playing is at a peak of expressive beauty here, far more tasteful and beyond the technic, at this point, of what any rock and roll guitarist was yet capable of. yes, the rock and rollers would improve greatly in time, but this was 1964, and King was the undisputed guitar king. a fine horn section, it should be mentioned, also graces the album. the whole affair is magical. a great night in recording history.
B000001FS3|5.0|When this album was released in 1987, U2 was already one of the world's most popular bands, even though their previous album, 1984's \\"The Unforgettable Fire\\", had been coolly received by fans and critics alike.  Their reputation remained high, though, with the tremendous \\"October\\" from 1982 and \\"War\\" from 1983 still fresh in fans' minds.<br /><br />Nobody, however, really expected U2 to put it all together like this.<br /><br />This album is sheer brilliance from top to bottom in every way.  Young music fans should consider this an absolute essential in starting a collection, because it's one of the few real classics that carry a sound that still stands fresh today.<br /><br />What is truly amazing to me about this album is that there are so many songs that can stand completely on their own - \\"Where the Streets Have No Name\\", \\"I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For\\" and \\"With or Without You\\" were all major hits worldwide, and yet so many other songs - practically ALL of them - have become cover targets for other artists and have such striking individual relevance that it's hard to also believe how cohesively they fit together as an album.  \\"Bullet the Blue Sky\\" follows an early synopsis of international terrorism, \\"Running to Stand Still\\" follows the descent of a heroin addict, and the rest of the album follows topic after relevant topic with \\"Red Hill Mining Town\\", \\"Trip Through Your Wires\\", \\"One Tree Hill\\" and \\"Exit\\".<br /><br />In many ways, I've compared this album as the opposite bookend to the Beatles \\"Sergeant Pepper\\", framing 20 years of amazing music from the other side of the Atlantic.  This is the greatest performance of all from the world's most significant musicians of the last 25 years.
B00005JPLU|3.0|OK I understand young people's admiration for this movies' explosive and riveting action sequences. Pound for pound this movie is a knockout! <br /> <br />But all those people who fantasize the notion that this was a deep and meaningful depiction about human spirit and triumph, please watch it again. This has to be the first movie ever to depict an entire historical civilization as subhuman. Akin to goblins and orcs. Had a similar movie been made by Nazis during the 40's, this would have been called propaganda. I understand this was based on Frank Miller's graphic novel but illustrating the Perisan civilisation as such, is irresponsible. Some of the reviews here are testament to this. The romantic and poetic evaluations here are preposterous.  Human spirit should not be defined by foes and enemies. Open your eyes and the world might bleed a little less... and global stability might improve my stocks! HA. That is the reality. <br /> <br />Goodnight Children <br />   <br />    <br />
B000683VI4|5.0|I absoulutely LOVE this movie. It is one of my favorites. A wonderful story with wonderful actors.You will not want to leave this movie for one second. It is warm and full of surprises.A movie to watch over and over.
B000MGUZM0|4.0|Pros: <br />- It's the Arcade Fire <br />- Propulsively grim, thematic and compelling.  Completely gels after multiple spins  <br />- Evidence of great musicianship, dedication and talent <br />- Thrilling and sobering all at once <br /> <br />Cons: <br />- Expect Funeral part II?  Don't (for me, it's a pro) <br />- Spotty lyrics <br />- Can be a bit same-sounding <br />- Title track Neon Bible feels unfinished and is a weaker track than the rest of the album <br />- The Well and the Lighthouse sounds like a terrible Enigma and / or Enya song title
0375703861|5.0|I loved this book. The characters literally came to life for me, and I felt empathy for each and every one. I laughed out loud. I cried too. I think the Author has an awesome insight into a vast amount of different personalities. I never once found myself straining for credulity.  <br />The ending was very satisfying and touching to me!I did not want this book to end.
0156012197|5.0|I have been reading the \\"The Little Prince\\" to my children ages 44, 42, 36,28 and 24 since they were children. I now have a new audience of 21 grandchildren to read to. I have just recently become aware of other works by Antoine de Saint-Exupery and will certainly enjoy them also. I believe all children should read \\"The Little Prince\\".
0312323867|4.0|While Emily Griffen is very descriptive (aka- wordy!), I had great time reading this book and felt the emotional growth of the main character Darcey.  Definitely a good read for those long days at the beach!
0439813786|5.0|This story was extremely enjoyable and a surprisingly quick read.  Don't be intimidated by the number of pages. There are just as many drawings as there are pages to read. The illustrations MAKE the book.
B0000C8AW2|5.0|Not having previously owned everything Dylan ever recorded instead opting to selectively purchase various acclaimed CD's over the years, I took the plunge to purchase all Dylan SACD's when they became available. As others have noted the overall sound quality is mostly good with a few minor exceptions.  <br /> <br />Street Legal would most likely qualify as one of Dylan's lesser appreciated efforts over the years and is part of the reason it was one of the last of his SACD's I purchased. The 2 channel stereo SACD hybrid sound is near perfect. That I expected. What I didn't expect was how much I love the songs on this release! Yes, it is a highly polished production as numerous reviews have noted over the years. And, no I don't think this detracts from the brilliance of the songs one bit. I've never understood why the expectations for certain artists such as Dylan seems to be the songs must be presented in a certain stripped down, bare bones production style. I love the brassy all out ballsy approach to these songs and their heavy reliance on background singers. Yes it is a very polished heavily produced sound, but that in itself gives it a totally different feel than anything he previously recorded. <br /> <br />There truly is not a bad song in the bunch. From Changing of the Guards to the closer, Where are you Tonight it truly rocks out in an agressive manner people were not quite expecting. 1978 was the beginning of the end to disco, the emergence of punk and Dylan doesn't quite seem to know where he fits in, but I doubt he really cared. It remains a sharp deviation from the Rolling Thunder days and Blood on the Tracks. Dylan has never been afraid of confounding critics and purposely moving away from expectations. He may have accomplished both with Street Legal, but count me as one music lover who has belatedly jumped on this wagon for a ride. <br /> <br />
0340839937|5.0|I should be ashamed with myself that I have not written a review on this wonderful book until today.  Anyone with an interest in politics or economics will love this book.  Likewise, a reader who enjoys science fiction novels will enjoy this book and the the books following in the series. <br /> <br />\\"Dune's\\" ability to pull the reader quickly into a tumultuous time in the novel's universe is uncanny.  Picking this book up, even on the first page you'll be immersed in the Dune world.  The interjections of quotes from the Princess is a theme Herbert keeps throughout the series, and they offer unique insights into the story to come, the story thus far, or anecdotes that might shed interesting colors on the uniqueness of the characters. <br /> <br />Younger readers may find this book to be a tough read, and may miss the more subtle points of the novels interwoven political and economical undertones and the bearings they can have on our world today in our current political climate.  But nonetheless, even younger readers that have an open imagination can easily enjoy the vast sand dunes of Arrakis and all their mysteries.
B00005JNS0|5.0|I cannot say enough wonderful things about this film.  It is incredible.  Car lovers will flip for it, and adults and children of all ages will enjoy it.<br /><br />LOVE IT!
B000MGUZM0|4.0|Expectations can be a really bear.  Just ask The Shins, who made an album full of perfectly serviceable but decidedly non-life-changing songs on Wincing the Night Away.  Or Clap You Hands and Say Yeah, which received much praise for their self released debut, but released an uneventful effort with Some Loud Thunder.  Both those aforementioned bands received a good amount of critical backlash.  Everyone seemed to love them, but if their albums didn't reach the level of hype, people began to take offense.   <br /> <br />The Arcade Fire has experienced a similar situation with their sophomore release Neon Bible.  Funeral was a massive hit and a truly great album.  Funeral was emotional, visceral and was better than anything released this decade minus Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.  <br /> <br />So with all of these expectations, a rabid fan base looking for something transcendence, and a host of hip indie kids looking for a reason to hate it, the Arcade Fire deliver a great album.  Well...almost.  Neon Bible is one hell of an album, but it's not as good as Funeral.       <br /> <br />Lyrically, Win Butler has made a decidedly outward turn.  He is no longer singing about his personal experiences as a youth and adolescent.  He now turns his attention to social commentary regarding the world at large.  The lyrics have been compared numerous times to Bruce Springsteen, and I'm going to do the same thing.  They have The Bosses sense of seeing people from lower economic classes and critiquing things like war and poverty.   <br /> <br />Sonically, Neon Bible is a bombastic piece of music that sounds absolutely massive.  The band brings out a church organ, string arrangements by Owen Pallett of Final Fantasy, and a church choir on a number of songs.   <br /> <br />Black Mirror starts as a bit of a shock for fans of Funeral, as the opener is no where near as immediate as Neighborhood #1.  But with repeat listens, the somewhat muddy sounding production opens up to reveal a strong hook and melody.   <br /> <br />Keep the Car Running shows the strongest Springsteen influence, with a bouncy melody and Win singing in a low register reminiscent of Springsteen.  Or maybe it's just the reference to cars that make me feel this way.   <br /> <br />The first single Intervention is the best song on the album.  Intervention sounds truly epic, with the opening chugging church organ and a strumming guitar line.  Then the drums and the choir kick in, and the song flies off in to the space.  Win sounds like a demented preacher on this one.  Intervention is really a great song, and an early contender for song of the year.   <br /> <br />The rest of the album is very solid, with other highlights including The Well and the Lighthouse, the re-imagined of No Cars Go, and the closer My Body is a Cage which brings out the church organ again.   <br /> <br />So it's different than Funeral, and to some fans, that may be a bad thing, but to me it's not.  Neon Bible stands by itself as a worthy follow up to Funeral.  Funeral was more cohesive as an album, using song suites like the Neighborhood songs to add cohesion.  Neon Bible comes off more as a collection of songs that are similar lyrically but are fairly different stylistically from song to song.   <br /> <br />Neon Bible is recommended for fans of the Arcade Fire and fans of good music in general.  This the best album of the year so far, and a strong contender for album of the year.     <br /> <br />
B000JBWWRY|5.0|Loved it as a kid, and now I love sharing it with my boys!
B0000032BZ|5.0|wow the Zombies imploded after recording this magnum opus from the 60's that beats both Sgt Peppers and Pet Sounds hands down. Oracle is the essential album from the golden age of pop with pyschedelic flourishes baroque arrangements that rival The left Banke and a set of songs that are amazing. Time of the Season is the hit on this one and is a good example but the other songs outshine it even brighter. Colin Bluntstones vocals are gorgeous and the instrumentation is topnotch. What also makes this so unique is its a stab at pyschedelia that isnt typical- sure they were influenced and this was there attempt but it came across as utterly something new. If you get this album i recommend just getting the original album without the bonus tracks or stereo mix. hear it in its original form as it was intended. I also recommend The pretty Things- S.F Sorrow** Love_forever Changes** H.P Lovecraft- 2** and Pink Floyd's Piper at the gates of dawn. All classics from this time period.
0618680004|5.0|Richard Dawkins' well-written, scholarly, and persuasive treatise, \\"The God Delusion\\", is a comprehensive and devastating assault on God, Abrahamic religion, and the perverse behaviour it engenders.  Dawkins' systematically prefaces his wide-ranging assault by first drawing a distinction between Einsteinian and Abrahamic religion:  the former renouncing belief in a personal, supernatural god (Albert Einstein is, of course, the most famous and visible figure of this `religion') versus the personal god embracing latter (note that the latter includes the three great monotheistic religions - Judaism, Christianity, & Islam), followed by a brief review of core terminology (theism, deism, & pantheism).  Dawkins' then proffers that the existence of God can - and should - be tested like any claim - via a scientific hypothesis.  His penultimate conclusion, \\"God almost certainly doesn't exist\\", owes its directness to the arguments and evidence used to support the hypothesis:  \\"any creative intelligence, of sufficient complexity to design anything, comes into existence only as the end product of an extended process of gradual evolution.\\"  The allusion to evolution - Darwinian evolution - underscores many of the arguments in the book and is invoked multiple times to illustrate that the elegance upon which our existence relies is *not* due to chance or intelligent design.  To quote Dawkins, \\"Intelligent design is not the proper alternative to chance.  Natural selection is not only a parsimonious, plausible and elegant solution; it is the only workable alternative to chance that has ever been suggested...[intelligent design] is simply not a plausible solution to the riddle of statistical improbability.  And the higher the improbability, the more implausible intelligent design becomes\\" (pp.120).  This book continues in the same vein:  presenting arguments, counter-arguments, and evidence to debunk the naïve and shortsighted belief in God and religion.  Dawkins also manages to interject the timely quip or quote (either his or another's) to much effect, to wit, \\"All religions are the same:  religion is basically guilt, with different holidays\\" (Cathy Ladman, pp167-8); \\"People say we need religion when what they really mean is we need police\\" (H.L. Mencken, pp. 228-9); \\"Religion is excellent stuff for keeping common people quiet\\" (Napoleon, pp. 276); and two of my favorites, \\"Religion is regarded by the common people as true, by the wise as false, and by the rulers as useful\\" (Seneca the Younger, pp. 276) and \\"There is in every village a torch - the teacher:  and an extinguisher - the clergyman\\" (Victor Hugo, pp. 309).  This book ought to be read by anyone with an open, eager, and truth-seeking mind but, unfortunately, the very folks that should be reading it, won't.  At any rate, a stellar read worth purchasing, reading, and discussing in open discourse!
B000MCH5P4|1.0|Babel is equal to a boring movie mixed with a Bollywood musical, minus the fantastical song-and-dance numbers, and plus Brad Pitt with slightly-older-guy make-up. <br /> <br />This is basically a movie that kids will enjoy, akin to \\"The Last Unicorn,\\" \\"The Last Starfighter,\\" and perhaps \\"The Last Tango in Paris,\\" although I must admit I never saw the latter. <br /> <br />It is basically the story of neglectful parents getting shot while their kids travel to Mexico and have crazy wonderful adventures.  Sure, that's every kid's dream but these ungrateful ingrates seem to whine the entire time about wanting to go home.  Guess who I wouldn't be taking to Mexico with me next time?  That's right.  The ingrates.  Or \\"los ingratos\\" as they would say in Mejico. <br /> <br />There is also a plot about kids playing around with guns, which I am opposed to, so I won't discuss that part any further. <br /> <br />Also, there is a deaf kid who is nudie and sad, but it's her Dad's fault because he had a rifle once. <br /> <br />The moral of Babel is that if you are going to get shot by a stray bullet, try to do it in a more populated area, like Seattle, where the fabulously dreamy cast of \\"Grey's Anatomy\\" can fix you up like magic, make fun of your McSexuality, and then have affairs with each other. <br /> <br />If you want to see a better Brad Pitt movie, try watching \\"Too Young To Die,\\" \\"Kalifornia,\\" or \\"Cool World,\\" all of which have either Juliette Lewis or cartoons in them.
1582701709|5.0|The Secret gets right to the point that ones mentality does indeed create ones reality.  Although the book is a repackaged package of what has already been known, practiced and written by many before, it is written in a form that anyone would be able to understand and therefore apply the information contained herein to their own lives. If you wish to take the information one step further I recommned the the book Quantum Success by Sandra Anne Taylor.  I have personaly used the same information contained in such books in my own life and is the philosophy behind my own writings and teachings in The L.E.A.N. Factor.

B0002DB0FO|5.0|We were so bummed to have gotten into this show when it was so close to the end of it being in TV.  So I was so happy to get the first season and now can't waite to get the other years to watch.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this CD.  I enjoyed it so much I bought another to give to a friend.  The music is just fantastic.
1582701709|5.0|The Secret lived up to my expectations.  The philosophy of basing your life on the law of attraction has many sound principles.  The book is an easy read, and with the many contributing authors--it is extremely interesting.  Even those who do not \\"buy into\\" the whole idea, should still be able to find parts that speak to them.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|The BBC and Masterpiece Theater did a great job with this movie! It is one of my favorites!
1400082773|5.0|The story is interesting.  The insights are compelling.  Know the man you ought to vote for. Read this book.
B00004CWO8|5.0|Having seen this production both live and on TV it was a must to purchase the DVD.  There are some critical points but, in the main, the dramatic power of Matthew Bourne's chorography coupled with the performance of Adam Cooper and his corp of male swans it is a frightening depiction of what could have been if Pepita had dispensed with his tutu's and shocked the world with a production which would,I am sure, have met with Tchaikovsky's approval.  I found some of the movement a little ghose particularly the assemble work in the early scenes but the par de dur between Cooper and Scott Ambler must be seen to be believed.
1582701709|3.0|At the end of the day, you have to work. I understand the importance of wishing and believing, that makes sense. But this is a world where you have to put effort in to get results.
B000002B35|5.0|For those of you buying the CD without seeing the DVD concert, you may not appreciate or understand what is happening. The DVD is very visual, so just hearing the CD may not be as good. We rented the Pulse DVD and were amazed at how much we loved it. Roger Waters isn't there, true, but Gilmore and band mates did a fantatstic job. I bought the DVD after renting it and then bought the CD for our car. It takes you back to moments of the DVD. Crank it up!
B00007LTIB|5.0|Relayer doesn't get the attention it has always deserved.  It is their crowning achievement, and I think that many dismiss it because there was no Wakeman.  This recording is not only just fine without him, I think it is better. <br /> <br />Here you have an epic 20-minute track (like something from Tales) along with 2 moderate-length tracks.  Each track is absolutely excellent - creative, soul-stirring, passionate music that Yes is famous for, but unlike any of their other albums, there is not one weak track here.  Not even a weak moment.  This record was Yes telling the world to stuff it after getting so much (undeserved) grief over Tales. <br /> <br />As for Moraz, his jazz stylings work better with rock music than classical stylings ever will.  Why he left Yes, or was asked to, I'll never understand.  This was their last really great recording, and he definitely made a serious contribution to its success.
055358202X|4.0|George R.R. Martin takes us there again....or does he? While his epilogue explains the lack of certain character development we must be wary of whether he is selling out like so many other authors..namely Robert Jordan. But no, in actuality he is playing the smart card with this recent release. Unlike other authors he is giving us depth into characters that are important to this series, but otherwise might have been glossed over in a chapeter or two. I mean really... I just want to know what is happening on the wall...or do I? That is the problem, to decide about what is actually revelant, and what isn't. I have faith. I have faith that he will pull it together in the next book or so. Other than that Lil' complaint, I loved it. I read it in 4 days.
B000GPIPVU|3.0|Like a lot of sophomore releases this one does not build on the debut album. <br /> <br />Ray writes great lyrics and has a haunting voice. And together with his guitar playing makes great music.  He doesn't require much in the way of accompaniment.  <br /> <br />This album is overproduced. Too many backing instruments and layers that aren't needed.  <br /> <br />
B00004RYQP|5.0|I would give it four thumbs up if I had four hands!  The special effects are spectacular, the cast work together, and the storyline keeps you watching.  Would love to have seen a sequel to this one....oh, and Penny Robinson is just as cute as she can be.
6304698682|4.0|This is a very entertaining Clint Eastwood western, that I have probably watched more times than any other film. Its nearer 5 stars for me in fact. Certainly if you've see Shane and Eastwoods own High Plains Drifter you'll have a good idea what to expect.<br /><br />However, there is more going on here than you might initially think. Eastwoods preacher certainly appears to be a ghost or supernatural apparition of some sort. In the prelude to the final gunfight he should be dead (this is the scene where the preacher sits with his back to the door drinking Coffee). The supernatural element is hinted at a few times but not overplayed.<br /><br />Whether you accept the premise of a supernatural element is actually irrelevant. Eastwood plays the part with his usual conviction and magnetic screen presense. You'll believe that he could outgun or outfight a whole army on his own - supernatural or not!
B00002ND77|5.0|With tremendous performances by Denzel Washington (Malcolm X) and Angela Bassett (Betty Shabazz), Spike Lee delivers what is arguably his greatest movie which will stand the test of time.<br /><br />Lee does a masterful job in showing how this was truly a partnership between husband and wife, which - in my opinion - is too often ignored by authors/historians when chronicling the life of Malcolm X.<br /><br />It is Betty Shabazz who enlightens Malcolm X on any number of subjects, including the philandering of Elijah Muhammad (Al Freeman Jr.), and how the young women are tossed to the side like bags of trash, especially in their greatest time of emotional need, when they are pregnant.<br /><br />The process is arduous and painful for Malcolm X to finally admit that the evidence is overwhelming that his mentor & teacher has used his position of power to manipulate the fragility of others for crass carnal desires. It begins the chasm between the pair that ultimately led to the assassination of Malcolm X.<br /><br />What remains the most powerful single scene is Malcolm X walking down the street while the ills of the 'hood are played out before him. So much is said in so little time in depicting the black holocaust of the mind, body and soul.<br /><br />Lee takes cinema to a powerful and dramatic level that is rarely achieved. This is an epic tale of spiritual growth, family and how jealousy & hatred can destroy so much in the instant it takes me to finish this sentence.
0688145078|5.0|This book is a perfect fit for the age group specified, and I am very pleased after purchasing it for my nephew after the birth of a baby brother. The pictures are very detailed and colorful, and the illustrator is wonderful. The story is not too long, and not too simplified to be boring for parents to read over and over again.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|This is a great looking watch.  It feels solid and works very well.  I have found it to be more than adequate in its accuracy.   <br /> <br />I fully understand that this is not an \\"investment timepiece\\" but for now it is around $100, and looks and feels great.   <br /> <br />I strongly recommend this watch.
B00002ND77|5.0|Excellent!  Denzel Washington's performance was dead on and true.  Kudos to Spike Lee for telling the story of Malcolm X.  The music was even awesome and accurate for the time periods.  This is a must see if you either don't know who Malcolm X is or if you think he was just a militant angry black man.  He was brilliant.
B000001GK0|5.0|The Schumann and Grieg are frequently paired on recordings and for good reason.  They kind of book-end the great era of romantic piano concerti.  Both are in A minor and the Grieg mirrors in every respect the Schumann in terms of structure and thematic development. Zimerman again (as in the Ravel concerti) is astounding in his ability find new rhythmic accents which lend unexpected freshness that are exciting but still respect the composer's intentions.  I have never heard the 1st movement cadenza in the Grieg played with more passion and thunder and the same holds true for the Schumann.  Von Karajan surprises too with uncharacteristic vitality in all the tempi, even if he does hold the final orchestra tuttis almost to the breaking point.  All in all, a thrilling recording proving again what a stunning virtuoso Zimerman is.  Don't pass this up--a must for any collector of the romantic piano concerto.  They will sound brand new to you, no matter how many recordings you already have of these timeless masterpieces.
B00005U8EM|5.0|This is one of the funniest movies you're going to see...but it's also got some thoughtful messages about life.  Some of the funniest scenes are when Murray's character realizes he not only can't get out of Groundhog's Day, but there are no consequences to his actions, because he keeps waking up to the same day.  What follows is a hilarious string of self-destructive situations...just how many ways CAN a person try to kill themselves?! My personal favorite scene is in the diner, where Murray gorges on every artery clogging breakfast treat, while smoking a cigarette...gluttony at it's best! As the movie moves along and he tires of his self-descructive attitude, Murray's character starts to explore the possibilities of having unlimited time to do all the things a person would ever want to do and how much more meaningful it is to be kind instead of cruel.  Interesting twist...while being lots of fun.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|We had seen part of this concert on PBS, prior to it's DVD release, and couldn't wait to watch it on our home theater system.  The sound and visual quality are both  excellent. All 5  vocalists have beautiful voices, and the staging and musical arrangements are faultless. The \\" making of\\" extra is also much better than the ones that often accompany concert DVDs. <br /> <br />Overall a classy, entertaining package that rewards repeated viewings. <br />
B00005JLPK|3.0|Frida is a cinematic whitewash of the real Frida Kahlo who was both physically beautiful and spiritually ugly.  She was regarded by many of her fellow artists as being a \\"despicable cur.\\"  This movie presents a sanitized  version of Kahlo's life and left out much of what was an oftentimes ugly personal life.   <br /> <br />Frida Kahlo was a great artist and a horrible person.  This movie fails to present the latter part of her personality and it suffers because of that deficiency.
B00005JO9J|4.0|There are some episodes I missed when the show was first new.  This is a great commercial free way to catch up on everything I missed.
B000MVQ9P2|1.0|This movie is horrible beyond words. I remember walking out of the theatre teary-eyed and thinking, \\"That's an hour and a half of my life I'll never get back.\\" Yes, it was that bad.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|GREAT MOVIE!!  CAN'T WAIT TO WATCH IT AGAIN!  WOULD HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT TO <br />ANYONE OVER 17...TOO VIOLENT FOR MINORS!  LOTS OF TWISTS AND TURNS, <br />GREAT CAST.  SCORCESE DESERVED THE OSCAR...AND ABOUT TIME!
B00011F5DK|5.0|This was a gift to my grandson, who will be six in July.  This is a challenging and fun game, not only for him, but for his parents (and eventually his sister, who is now 2 years old).  I'm thinking of purchasing it for myself it's so much fun.

B000MTPANQ|5.0|With each of these new/old releases, Neil Young resurrects the excitement and anticipation that accompanied the emergence of the singer-songwriter era.  Like Dylan's Bootleg Series, these \\"Archives\\" will live for generations as a testament to a period in popular music whose like will not be seen again. As someone old enough to have experienced it all in real time, I cannot help but wonder how listeners a generation younger hear these songs.  It's my hope that Neil Young's impact on the best of what's followed has not been lost on them, for the depth, brilliance and purity of these songs, and of these performances, simply cannot be overstated.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|This isn't a 4 star review of the film...its a complaint with the second disc and the  special features which aren't very special.  When  compared to ALL the other BONDS which have endless bonus features the newest is thin and I suspect a 3 disc ULTIMATE edition is in the offing.  The making of ...is very much an extended press kit and fluff... under a half hour, the other featurette James Bond FOR REAL is a bit more interesting/enjoyable examination of the major stunts.  the biggest bonus feature \\"The Girls OF Bond\\" which they say is 2006 ...was available as a separate DVD by Best Buy with the release of Die Another Day...so its really just something MGM had laying around....to fatten up the \\"90 minutes of Extras\\" sticker.  Bottom line..you get about 50 minutes of NEW  Extras. I am wondering why no commentary?  this is one of the thinest 2 disc sets on the market...I had to check to make sure it wasn't a Universal release (kings of inane 2 disc sets).    Enjoy the movie..but don't expect to view disc 2  more than once.
0446310786|5.0|This is an amazing book. It should be part of a required reading list for speakers of the English language. A Classic
B00008OLYN|4.0|This was my first Opeth CD; I picked it up based on a recommendation from a co-worker.  Initially, I was disappointed as I was expecting something heavier.  Later I learned that this is Opeth's most mellow album: You won't hear any \\"death grunts\\" on this CD!  After listening to (and purchasing) more Opeth CDs, I now appreciate this CD more, but still prefer some of their heavier stuff. <br /> <br />Very good music.  If you're into progressive rock (yes, rock, not metal) then give this a try.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Director Martin Scorsese, who has often been hailed as one of the best directors of all time, has had his share of success in Hollywood.  With hits such as \\"Raging Bull\\", \\"Goodfellas\\", \\"The Aviator\\", and \\"Casino\\", it's easy too understand just how he got to be so successful.  After taking a break from directing mafia themed movies for a while, his last mafia movie was \\"Casino\\", Scorsese returns to the subject matter that has treated him so well in the past, and delivers audiences what could easily be his best work to date, \\"The Departed\\". <br /> <br />\\"The Departed\\" is an intricate cat-and-mouse game, but this time the cat and mouse are both rats: Colin Sullivan (Matt Damon) is an ambitious cop on the rise, planted in the Boston police force by mobster Frank Costello (Jack Nicholson). Billy Costigan (Leonardo DiCaprio) is a hot-tempered police cadet who's been artificially disgraced and then planted into Costello's crime operation as a seemingly trustworthy soldier, assigned to discover who Costello has embedded in the police force. <br /> <br />With such an excellent cast of actors ranging from veterans Jack Nicholson (easily giving one of his best performances), Martin Sheen, and Alec Baldwin to younger, yet experienced, actors Leonardo DiCaprio (giving his best performance as well), Mark Wahlberg, and Matt Damon, it's no surprise that Scorsese came through with such an incredible movie experience.  The writing from veteran writer William Monahan (writer of \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\") is tight, never letting up with the twists and turns, while still managing to keep the movie from being confusing to the audience.  Martin Scorsese, after a long and successful career, has finally achieved that which has always eluded him, a Best Director's Oscar for his work here, and I have two things to say about that; 1) it's about time, and 2) this movie, and all involved, deserved all the awards they received. <br /> <br />If you have yet to see this movie, waste no more time, go rentit or buy it (I guarantee it's worth it to just buy the movie), and enjoy what is easily one of the most intense dramatic movies you may ever see.  You will not be disappointed. <br /> <br />\\"The Departed\\" is rated R for violence, language, and sexuality.
B00000G3AZ|5.0|I read \\"Emma\\" after learning it was one of the favorite books of two of my favorite authors (Susanna Clark and J.K. Rowling).  I chuckled out loud at least every other page at the charming, whimsical story which has since become one of my own favorites.<br /><br />This version of the movie is just as charming, whimsical, and funny as the book.  Don't listen to people who think Jane Austen stories are supposed to be all serious and austere like the Kate Beckinsale version.  This movie is truer to the spirit of the book than any other adaptation I've seen of any Jane Austen book.

B000LXHK2C|2.0|I came into this movie with such high expectations, how could one not?  I mean you have an A-list actor and director in Crowe and Scott respectively, and this \\"intoxicating\\" vineyard in France as the backdrop of the story, with ROMANCE being the main theme.  At no point was I emotionally connected to any of the characters.  The French Chic was hardly in the movie, about 1:30 mins in she becomes a \\"major player\\".  I kept looking at my DVD running time wondering when this alleged ROMANCE was going to develop!  That being said you have the typical filler characters (the daughter, the vitners assistant) blah blah blah.  They spent too much time with Crowe going back and forth about selling the place, without ever developing the emotional/romantic connection that he was \\"awoken\\" too.  For all the men, I urge you to pass this up when you and the lady are browsing the new releases, just tell them some guy on [...] told you \\"it sucked\\".
1401301363|4.0|I love her holiday recipes...a mix of English and American customs.  Nice to see someone in Europe celebrating American delights such as the turkey for Thanksgiving dinner along with pumpkins, cranberries, maple syrup, and other native food items of North America. <br /> <br />One let down was the recipe for the old fashioned chocolate cake.  While it looked yummy when I baked it, it came out a little dry.  Was worried about that when I noticed the very thick batter.  Guess I will have to experiment with the recipe a little more...it was easy to make, though.
B000F3TBIO|3.0|Mojo is an awsome song. Bought the albumn because of it.  Everything else was a disapointment.  Sample the cd before you buy!!!
B000J103PC|5.0|Anne Hathaway comes off here like an American latter day Audrey Hepburn.  Her charm is infectious and it's a delightful performance.  But she's out distanced by Emily Blunt, who plays her co-worker.  But it is Streep who dominates the film with her best performance in years.  She's the dragon lady managing editor and yet she musters up some pretty strong stuff later in the film making the character sympathetic for a few moments. <br /> <br />This is a great film.  It's about the world of fashion but anyone who has ever had the boss from hell, will relate heavily here.

B00006X06U|5.0|Travelogue is a collection of the most brilliant songs that Joni Mitchell wrote throughout her remarkable career. But Travalogue is far more than a 'greatest hits' album. All songs are approached in an entirely new and fresh way. The dust - with all respect!- is gently blown away from all those incredible songs that were written throughout the many years of Mitchell's career and many of which gained an everlasting place in the All Time American Songbook.(e.g. Woodstock, Amelia, Hejira, The Circle Game, Otis and Marlena)  <br />Once again Joni Mitchell collaborates with one of the most innovating and exciting arrangers/composers of today: Vince Mendoza. The result is astonishing. With the help of a full symphony orchestra of the finest musicians the musical scope and fantasy of Vince Mendoza has no limitations. The musical scores echoe the musical style of Ravel, Bartok, Ligeti, Zappa and many more. The pure and moving 'one of a million' voice and brilliant timing of Joni Mitchell does the rest. Travelogue is an album of haunting beauty and the ultimate tribute to both the genius of Joni Mitchell and Vince Mendoza. A masterpiece of the highest standard. Period.
B00004R9A4|4.0|I watched this movie when I was six years old, now after 32 years I can see it again and it was as magical,fun and beautiful as the first time. It's a Disney's Classic and it's a must own.maybe the animation  and color of the movies nowdays is  wonderful but  disney classic animation movies are a treasure to save.
0060775858|5.0|This is an excellent book to read with your kids/grandkids in your lap.  You read the words, and they look at the pictures.  Very soothing and relaxing.
B0009MAO46|5.0|The 3D animation is awesome, in fact it was the first movie using this technology so it made history because of that. The story is very funny but also teaches a lot of good values to kids and adults, like loyalty  work team and friendship. the bonus and dvd box is great too.
B000KCHZK6|1.0|If you've heard Norah's last 2 albums, then you've heard this one too. Very boring and uninspired. Lack of range and lack of emotion. There's nothing new or fresh about her new album at all. Everything Norah's done has been done over more than twice. She should've gotten in touch with Timberland and The Neptunes and they would've produced something for her that would've been much better. This is lullaby music all right. It made me extremly sleepy.
B0000TG9E2|3.0|It's a Classic movie, a masterpiece but I think it's also one of the most confusing movies for a child, dialogues and situations are not easy to understand for a small kid.
0373771665|5.0|Recently I decided to try my hand at writing a Regency romance, and after re-reading a couple of Jane Austens, I decided to look up my old Georgette Heyers, which I'd read back in high school and college. Of course my old paperbacks are difficult to find, so I was happy to see new editions of \\"Venetia\\" and a few others at Borders. Heyer is ideal for anyone who wants to know about the Regency period--unlike Austen, she's writing for an audience who may be unfamiliar with the manners and fashions of the time, so one gets a clearer picture of some details--but her real attraction is, of course, that she knows how to tell a tale, with humor and suspense and intriguing heroes and intelligent heroines that any reader can identify with. Austen reigns, but Heyer stands at her right hand, indispensable for any Regency reader--and for any lover of a good story, period.

B000M4RG42|4.0|Very well done in terms of describing the true nature of wars.  Other war movies attempt to truly describe the battle, and in fact they do a lot better, but none describes the nature of wars better than this movie as far as I can remember.  It opens up a whole new field for the war movie category - kind of like a 21st-century war movie.  It would have been much better, i.e. perfect,  if fewer flashbacks were employed.  Can't wait to see Letters From Iwo Jima.
1582701709|2.0|The central idea expressed in this book is reminiscent of Norman Vincent Peale's \\"Power of Postive Thinking.\\" However, it goes a step further into the surreal area of wishing something so -- a bit far-fetched. You can want something, focus on it, tailor all of your actions towards that end, and perhaps realize your dream, but merely expecting and wishing something into reality and structuring your thinking as if you have already attained your goal is beyond credibility, in my view.  An outstanding commercial venture! Hooray for the author! She has gotten what she wants alright, but she did not just wish for it and expect it to happen. She worked for it (researching, etc.), did she not?
B000H0MKOC|4.0|When I saw the previews for Thank You For Smoking for the first time on a new release DVD I was intrigued.  I had never even heard of this movie before.  In the previews, the movie seemed hysterically funny.  But that is what previews are for.  It's not hysterically funny.  Not at all.  Now...  I know what you're thinking.  I didn't like the movie.  Right?  Wrong! Thank You For Smoking is a good movie.  It's thought-provoking and clever and feindishly un-PC and I like that.  I like it alot!  Movies that poke fun at all the inconsistent beliefs of uptight Americans usually aren't this good, but Smoking is.  Well-written and perfectly casted (Robert Duvall, Rob Lowe, Katie Holmes, Sam Elliott, William H. Macy, and more!) Thank You For Smoking follows along with the exploits of Tobacco Lobbyist Nick Naylor (Aron Eckhart) who's greatest asset is his ability to BS and argue.  While pushing a product like cigarettes onto the citizens of the world Naylor still manages to keep himself grounded,trying to teach life lessons to his 12 year old son.  Are cigarettes poison?  Not enough evidence to suggest that, as Naylor would say.  It's big business vs. anyone with so-called morales.  Poignant without being pushy, Thank You For Smoking makes you think while you laugh.  There are alot of subjects touched upon here that will make certain people squirm or look away, and that I think is why I enjoyed it so much.  Was it drop dead funny?  No.  No like they tote it in the ads and previews.  But it is good.  I will definitely watch it again.<br /><br />DIG IT!
B000000OF6|5.0|One of the biggest cd of Queen. It's a most in your list.
B000MGUZMU|5.0|The Arcade Fire create songs that strike me to the core of my sensibilties.  Anthemic, rockin', and beautifully sad.
B000003TA4|4.0|...but it's still excellent throughout, though just SLIGHTLY overrated. How could a four-star disc be overrated, you ask? Well, I don't hear the voice of God in every track. I do in most, but a couple in the end kinda bored me - On a Plain sounded much better Unplugged, and there's just no saving tripe like Territorial Pissings, Lounge Act or Stay Away.<br /><br />Now, let's get to the GOOD stuff! Yeah, there's plenty of that. For starters is the deserved smash Smells Like Teen Spirit - heavy yet melodic, hard-rocking yet vunerable, with one of the best guitar riffs of the '90's, yadda yadda yadda. All the praise you've heard about it is true. Even better is Lithium, disturbing yet unforgettable lyrics and a stick-in-your-mind, Dazed and Confused-esque descending bassline. And lotsa melody. Which is one reason I love Nirvana - Cobain's melodies were exquisite. Come As You Are is higlighted by a downright unforgettable ringing riff, In Bloom by a strong drum track and snarled refrain. Polly deals with rape in a disturbingly stark way, drawing you in while scaring you off. Breed and Drain You are some pretty raw, rockin' stuff, the kind of song the group did best. These were the hits, but how could anybody let the droning, mesmeric closer Something in the Way slip under the radar? Totally underrated song, I think. And then there's that insane hidden track, Endless Nameless or whatever... whoa. Pure craziness.<br /><br />Not the best record of the '90's (Dirt), or even the best Nirvana album (In Utero). But it's the place to start, not only with the group but with alt-rock in general.<br /><br />I say screw all the angsty alt-rockers that were influenced by this album's lyrics. Kurt really was an alienated guy (he didn't WANT to be famous, for the love of Buddha!), and was communicating genuine emotions. As opposed to all these other morons, who whine about being \\"misunderstood\\" simply to make money.<br /><br />To close this rather wordy review, Nirvana (and Pearl Jam, and the rest of them) came just in time, justly knocking those stupid hair-metal bands off the charts and replacing them with a new golden age for rock rivaling the creatively fertile 1965-1975 period. It's a shame that, after this, crap groups like Green Day (who were essentially riding Nirvana's coattails), Oasis, MCR and Slipknot became popular...hem) came just in time, justly knocking those stupid hair-metal bands off the charts and replacing them with a new golden age for rock rivaling the creatively fertile 1965-1975 period.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|I was very suprised with this movie.  First, I thought that it would be a funny movie, I mean come on, Will Ferrell's in it and it's about a guy who hears a voice!  But it wasn't.  There are some funny parts but it's really not funny but pretty serious and really good.  I did not know Mr. Ferrell could act in a serious role and be good at it.  So far, I've not had reason to think that he could.  But he was excellent and I would very much recommend anyone see it.
B000002KDS|4.0|Coop really deserves more credit for inventing the \\"melodic hard-rock\\" subgenre. Yes, it later gave way to hair-metal (bleargh), but in the proper hands it could be amazing. Alice Cooper are among those \\"proper hands\\", so what this album does best is tight, crafty, melodic hard rock - loud and gritty, but hummable and well-performed, often with funny lyrics. Classics such as the self-referential groupie anthem Be My Lover and horn-powered rocker Under My Wheels, as well as should-be classics like the punkish Yeah, Yeah, Yeah and swaggering You Drive Me Nervous fit the bill there.<br /><br />But sometimes you have to wonder what my man Alice was smoking. Like on Dead Babies... that is one weird song. Dark, creepy stuff. And hey, if you're going to protest child abuse, you might as well make it dark and creepy, right? Sure enough, it's one of the album's several standouts, a chilling tale of Little Betty's \\"adventures\\" with a pound of aspirin. Desparado is so far removed from the rest of the album, it's like it's by a completely different band. It's not the Eagles song, thank god - it's a dark, moody, cinematic masterpiece with a spot-on, Jim Morrison-esque vocal from Alice. Morrison happened to be one of Coop's drinking buddies. Talk about friends in high places!<br /><br />But Jim must've slipped something funny into Alice's drink one night, becuase the two songs I've yet to discuss are pure crap. Halo of Flies and the title song both are random jams that completely fall apart. It's not that the group didn't have the chops to pull them off (they did), but assorted wanking without even the slightest hint of song structure is NOT what the group does best. That's what you leave to the jazz artists. Okay, I'm not gonna close this on a negative note - this is their best release ever, and one of the best hard rock albums out there. It's also probably the highest four-star I've ever given - had even one of the two jams been dropped, I would've forgotten about the other and boosted it to five (secretly 4.5, though). Okay, I'm being negative again, and I don't want to be because this is one solid album, easily the group's finest work.t to five (secretly 4.5, though). Okay, I'm being negative again, and I don't want to be because this is one solid album, easily the group's finest work.
B000000WCA|5.0|The Spice girls hit it off really well with Wannabe.  Gorgeous voices, and harmonies start this cd off. The Spice Girls are talented enough to sing through the cd and dance at the same time.  GReat Job!!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This movie has the same sensation as the Pride & Prejudice, only have the suspense feeling to it. It's a great movie for someone who want to see a old century movie.  I've watched it twice and I'm sure I'll watch it again.  It's a great one.
B000N4SHPS|5.0|I found this movie to be absoultely touching (and im a picky movie critic). The plot is done very well for the VI installment that the critics felt was a waste of time. The story is very heart-felt, memorable, and inspiring (like the orignal \\"Rocky\\"). It has moments of triumpth and utter sadness and makes the audience feel as part of the saga. Sly did a great job at resurrecting the legendary character and bringing Rocky to a new generation and old fans. If you liked the first four, or even the fifth this movie will make you remember why Rocky is really an American icon in film. Please check it out!
0634022296|4.0|No surprises here.  All the Beatles' songs, all the chords.  There isn't a whole lot to say because I am sure everyone buying this book knows exactly what they are getting.  The main disappointment with this book is that the binding makes it very hard to keep the book open while trying to play the guitar, the purpose I am assuming everyone is buying this book for.
0425188809|5.0|As a dog lover and Dean Koontz fanatic, I absolutely devoured this book.  Einstein, Travis and Nora feel like family now.  Anyone who has a dog will absolutely adore this fast-paced read.  I will never look at my 3 year old pit/lab mix, Anubis, the same way again!  I'll always pretend in the back of my mind, that maybe he's the great, great, great, great grandson of Einstein!   <br /> <br />
B00005JPDS|4.0|Will Smith takes a departure from his usual daredevilry to star in this most emphatic story about a man trying to make it in the world. Chris Gardner (Smith) has made a bad business decision: He spends his entire life savings on a batch of bone density scanners that he can't sell, and now his family is in deep financial jeopardy. His wife, Linda (Thandie Newton), is forced to work two jobs and his son is placed in a day care facility that looks like a makeshift sweatshop. Chris himself travels from clinic to clinic, trying (but failing miserably) to sell what looks like a giant paperweight.  <br /> <br />On one of his daily escapades, Chris finds himself in front of the San Francisco Stock Exchange and has an epiphany that will change his life. He wants to be one of those happy people that seem to pour out the double doors everyday with their smiling faces, shining cars, and jingling pockets. In a last ditch I've-got-nothing-to-lose effort at \\"happyness\\", Chris enlists for a non-paying internship at a brokerage firm, armed with only a high school diploma and the ability to solve the Rubik's cube at a mind-boggling speed. However, the hits keep on coming: Chris loses his home, his wife and a few of his colossal paperweights while he and his son brave unbearable odds on the streets of San Francisco.  <br /> <br />\\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" will make you laugh, cry and empathize with a character that is executed to three dimensional perfection. Chris is a man  who is willing to stake everything to go for a dream that most people would say was far beyond his reach. He is sick of hearing \\"no\\" all his life; he is fed up with having no money all the time; and he is tired of being emasculated by his embittered wife everyday. Chris' only source of inspiration is his eight year old son, a mascot egging him on with the simplest of smiles. No obstacle is going to deter him, even if it means sleeping in a public toilet. Will he make it? You have to watch the film!    <br />
0743298020|5.0|This is a quite different book that I am used to reading. <br />I don't really know what my reaction is of yet.  I read this book 2 wks ago.  It is full of twists and turns.  Very eary, with ghosts and things that go bump in the night.  But not scary.  Full of references  for book lovers, that is why I picked up the book in the first place.   the book asks the question, is books more important than life. The opening question starts basically does your history start before you are born or when you are born. My answer, is your history starts before you are born.  With your parents, and grandparents history.  With their behaviors (good-bad).   The the book pulls you in and doesn't stop.  And then there are layers and layers to talk about. The book is full of twists and turns and to keep everyone in order.  You need to write everything done.  If you like a mystery that is full of suspense and weird happenings then this book is for you. <br />I was actualy angry at the author.  Because it was so aggravating to keep everything straight and when you think you understand, something else happens to confuse you.   I will tell you it keeps you hopping and quessing.  If you have the love of books like obviously the author does. <br />And you like the English Gothic classics like Jane Eyre. This will intrigue you and grab you.  And that is for openers.  spoiler*** At the end, there is a light at the end of the tunnel.... There is a happy ending.  Thank G-d.
B000MV9026|2.0|There is no doubting the true stars of this movie: the animation and the soundtrack. Happy Feet, ultimately an updated tale of the ugly duckling, tackles the sensitive issues of stigma and exclusion in a unique way.<br /><br />In this movie penguins sing. They have a soul voice and this gives them cultural identity. But when the lead character, Mumbles, is born with the gift of dance, he finds himself automatically ostracized from his emperor penguin community. What follows is a journey to right wrong and a challenge to discrimination.<br /><br />One of the flaws of Happy Feet is that you are never too sure who the intended target audience is: adults or children. Whereas traditional CGI movies (think any Pixar movie or Shrek et al) beguile the kids and tickle begrudging parents, Happy Feet wades in far too long and not too deep. My children (a five year old and a eight year old) began to lose interest once the novelty of singing and dancing penguins wore off. When I watched this in the cinema most children were meandering through the aisles. The truly painful rendition of Queen's classic 'Find Me Somebody to Love' didn't help matters.<br /><br />For me this movie is a little like crossing Moulin Rougue with the penguin biscuit commercial and unfortunately, despite the positve sentiment and clear message that to be different isn't necessarily a bad thing, left me cold and my children very bored.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|We were amazed that this film wasn't an award winner.  It is an excellent film, and you might even see some style similarities between Howard Roark and Frank Lloyd Wright.
B000JBWWQ0|5.0|This is a great DVD. I read the book more than 10 years ago, and was glad to see it available on Amazon. Any product that helps us to educate us on becoming more positive and sensitive and loving to others, is a wonderful tool. I would recommend it very strongly.
0743277708|5.0|While the main characters in _Watership Down_ are rabbits, and they behave in very rabbit-like ways, the themes are very human: the displacement of a populace by a force both unjust and unstoppable, the fallacy of relying on physical strength and conventional wisdom rather than intelligence and creative thinking, the sacrifice of standing one's ground in the face of danger and death, and the loyalty owed to one's friends.  I recommend this book for those who enjoy reading fantasy and literature, those who find pleasure in beautiful descriptions of the English countryside, and those who love animals.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|This movie has a lot going for it...a unique plot, a tale of love lost and regained, glorious cinematography, excellent acting by Edward Norton, Jessica Biel [finally in a luminous & serious role], and Paul Giamatti. I am not going to review the entire movie and provide spoilers, watch it for the above reasons, and also, the excellent score, and you won't be disaapointed, esp if you're a fan of romantic, thrill-infused movies.
B000002I6T|5.0|One intriguing aspect of music ( and cinema also ) is how some become old ( meaning the perception ) and some , don't. This collection , originally an LP and now , remastered as a CD, was recorded in 1971, 36 years ago!! and my son ( 27 old  ) immediately like it. I'm suspect to say anything because I'm 52 and anyone could say that I am an old nostalgic guy, but its ( or his - Crosby ) atmosphere - chords, instrumental, vocal harmony(using playback to produce complexes vocal chords ),lyrics, are completely contemporary, or better, ageless.God blessing and long life for David Crosby.
0930289234|5.0|You might think of comics as melodrama or action that should kick into high gear right away and fill you with thrills, right? Well, Alan Moore thumbs his nose at you in this seminal graphic novel that isn't about your typical Super Heroes, it's about Super Heroes if they existed in the real world of ultra noisy global politics, economy, and media as human beings. It's particularly about the nuclear panic of the 80's.<br /><br />If you're worried it will all seem cliched to read now that it's about out it's particularly 80's elements, don't be. The story doesn't stand on just the confusion on those years, it stands on the fact that Moore is a master of fiction who's going to immerse you in an alternative world for purposes you will not be able to unravel as simply as if it were a comic book. In short, it's a work of high literature, not pulp, and you need to read it to see what all the fuss is about.<br /><br />One thing: stick with it through at least two chapters. The first one is a bit slow, but if I guarantee the second one will have you convinced.
B00005JNS0|5.0|this was the best movie i have seen in a long time! good for adults and kids. not at all too suggestive
0060763280|5.0|This book is a must read for anyone that has yet to create and maintain  healthy monetary habits.
B0009NCQJ6|5.0|The music was awesome on this CD.  The ladies are truly EXPLOSIVE.
B00003CX8N|3.0|For a film with very little plot, no climax, and minimal character development, I found 84 Charing Cross Road to be surprisingly compelling.  I found myself often wondering why I was so interested in how the film would develop, given the absense of what usually are important elements to good film making.   <br /> <br />The acting was quite good, especially Hopkins.
B0002E5O9G|5.0|This is my favorite collection because the performers are amazing.  I don't like the exploding balloon during little Cosette's song, but the lead singers in this CD couldn't be any better.
B000M5AJQS|4.0|The Movie is great. The special features disc has some interesting documentaries but, no real Behind the Scenes. This movie is a must have for any gangster/mob genre fan.
0920668372|1.0|This book was very disappointing, and quite frankly depressing for a new mother. My least favorite part was when the mother told the son you had better get here quick, and the image of him rocking what may be a dying mother was a little too much. There are sentimental stories, but this is just plain maudlin.
1931559317|3.0|This rating should probably be closer to a 4 however I just can't get over the misleading description \\"Pocket\\" Sky Atlas.  Over all it is what you would expect from a sky atlas. Decent easy to read maps, affordable price.  However if you want a true \\"pocket\\" sky atlas to take in the field that will fit in your pocket, I would suggest looking elsewhere.
B000EULJLU|5.0|Tool is the paragon.  A rarely heard combination of superior skill at individual instruments and fecund group dynamic, Tool exemplifies musical art and 10,000 Days represents the apex of their journey.  Older Tool fans might suggest that this album is A Perfect Circle instead of Tool, this is not the case.  Abstractly, that debate comes to the philosophical question of what defines something, the body, soul, or sum of its parts?  There is another belief that something is defined by the cognitive semblance of understanding of that thing.  That being said, the members of Tool know who they are.  The energy generated between the gamut of vocals of Maynard James Keenan, the invigorating bass of Justin Chancellor, the animus guitar of Adam Jones, and the fastidious drums of Danny Carey combine to vulcanize Tool and make 10,000 Days their best album.          Though 10,000 Days plays similar to Lateralus, with it's sometimes elegiac songs, operatic story telling, highs a lows like an EKG reading a massive coronary, and a definitive path on which you travel with the band, 10,000 Days is nothing short of an original masterpiece.  Despite not having the single hits as Lateralus, 10,000 Days injects all of its songs with as much passion and skill as the last.  The underlying tones of the CD are almost ominous whilst veracious, forcing listeners succumb to the genius and immerse into a world that has the potential of a lucid dream and the freedom of driving on the German Autobahn.  10,000 Days will put you in any world that you want to be in meanwhile restricting your perception to the actuality of your personal circumstances.  Maynard says; \\"Liar, Lawyer, Mirror, Voyeur, What's The Difference?\\" Ultimately our actions and beliefs are reflected in the entirety of humanity.  Fortunately for us, there are artists with the skill and desire to present ourselves to ourselves.  If you don't already have it, go and buy this album.

B000BYA5GO|5.0|I wasn't sure if I was going to like this movie and I will admit that I was only watching it for actor Jared Leto at first (I also really like Nicholas Cage, but would not watch a movie just for him). I really got in to it though and when it was over I loved it and it left me a little upset that it was over. It gives you some inoformation about arms dealing that is very interesting. It's a movie that gives you a whole range of emotions... you laugh, you get angry, you want to cry... I would highly recommend this one to everyone.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|The watch is super thin; you barely know you are wearing it.  In two weeks, I have had over 10 compliments!
B000NA28IE|1.0|Honestly, I wanted to cry as I sat there in the theater watching this movie. What a waste of ten bucks. If you have read the books, and excitedly waited out the release of the movie, you are undoubtably as disappointed as I am. The books had such scope, like a Lord of the Rings junior. There was no way to get everything important shoved into an hour and a half movie. Why not go ahead and make a 2 and a half hour epic? I'd have watched it!!<br /><br />Here is what you'll miss in the movie:<br /><br />-The relationship between Brom and Eragon is very underdeveloped, so much so that when Brom dies, you're like, whoopdeedoo.<br /><br />-Saphira ages from a tiny dragon into just about full grown in one ridiculous moment.<br /><br />-Eragon's journey with Murtagh is like, 5 seconds long. No Hadrac desert, no bonding. Again, you could care less about Murtagh in the movie.<br /><br />-The Dwarven kingdom was UNBELIEVABLY disappointing. If you read the book, you probably had quite a vision workded up in your head, with the Star Rose and all. The movie pretty much annihilates all that. And the dwarves themselves are stupid-looking. You can't slap some armor on a guy with a beard and call them a dwarf.<br /><br />-Arya is an ELF. Did they really go over on the budget that they couldn't even give her POINTED EARS???<br /><br />-The battle between Eragon and the Shade is like nothing. I was so bored.<br /><br />Over all, this movie takes a perfectly paced book and puts it into hyperdrive, taking all the wonder and fun right out of it. You'll sit down to watch this movie and all you'll be able to do is watch in horror as they slaughter it. It is a terrible shame. Had they had a larger CGI budget, blatantly copied some LOTR stuff, and had Mr. Paolini perhaps overseen the novel-to-script process, well, maybe he did, but they just shoved some more money at him and he said, \\"Whatever, I'm alright with you destroying my cool book. Go for it.\\"<br /><br />Now, if I were to choose one or two things from the movie that didn't totally and completely suck, I will say this:<br /><br />Saphira, for the amount of CGI that was spent on her, is perfect. She was totally real. The voice of Rachel Weisz is perfect as well. Eragon, Edward Speelers, he was great too. Too bad he had to over-act in order to compensate for the crappy, crappy dialogue and lack of character development.<br /><br />If they happen to make a sequel, Lord help us. The second book is even more complex and wide-scoped than the first. It will not translate well based on it's predecessor. I say they scrap the first movie, and make it all over, with a bigger budget, and the fans of the book get all editing priveledges. Then we'd have our Eragon come to life, rather than this horrible, mess of a mutilated movie!!ie that didn't totally and completely suck, I will say this: <br />Saphira, for the amount of CGI that was spent on her, is perfect.

0553579908|5.0|This second installment of A song of Ice and Fire is quite good. The story evolves quite well and the characters evolve in very interesting ways. The storyline is unexpected and unique.
1593080255|4.0|This book surprised me with its Gothic horror and surprising plot twists toward the end. This novel, for all its horrible philosophy on life, captures in a poignant way a lost person's search for fulfillment. Despite his indulgent quest for all kinds of pleasure, Dorian is still unfulfilled and in one of the most captivating passages of the book turns to opium to forget life. His descent into the opium den is characterized as a descent into hell, a personal hell which he has brought himself to and in which everyone sees through him and is against him.<br /><br />Though I wasn't a big fan at the beginning, as the book progressed I think it may have become one of the most memorable books I've read. The theme of the book is sin - its putrefying effect both on the sinner and those around him. One of the best moments of the book and one that sticks vividly in my mind is towards the end, when Dorian, sick of seeing his portrait so mangled and distorted by the sins he has already committed, does a \\"good deed\\" in order to try to start to clean it up. He races up the stairs, unlocks the secret room where his portrait is hidden, throws back the cover, and is faced with the same ugliness that had been there before. Then he is faced with a horrible realization of truth: because he had done the \\"good deed\\" out of motivation of making his own portrait/soul look better, he hadn't done a \\"good deed\\" at all and was now so deep in his depravity that even what he calls love has been warped into an all-encompassing egotism.<br /><br />Dorian's egotism gets progressively deeper. throughout the book. As Lord Henry says, It begins as innocent narcissism, but as it grows it begins to shunt blame for the sin of others and even motivates the good he does at the end of the book. Rather than his heavy sins bothering Dorian, \\"it was the living death of his own soul that troubled him\\" (226). His breakup with the young country girl was motivated more out of a desire to cleanse his portrait from its grime than any love for her, \\"for in hypocrisy he had worn the mask of goodness. For curiosity's sake he had tried the denial of self\\" (228). Being able to view his sin on the portrait in a sense made it more difficult to be selfless - \\"nothing makes one so vain as being told that one is a sinner. Conscience makes egotists of us all\\" (106) - and Dorian recognized this difficulty.<br /><br />The idea of pleasure in Dorian Gray is portrayed as a goal to pursue but never reach. \\"A cigarette is the perfect type of a perfect pleasure. It is exquisite, and it leaves one unsatisfied\\" (84). Despite Dorian's pursuit of pleasure (and pleasure of the most exquisite kind) he ends us dissatisfied and empty, jaded to the idea of the fullness of life. He is encouraged on by the influence of Lord Henry, who gives advice such as: \\"The only way to get rid of a temptation is to yield to it,\\" (21) and \\"sin is the only real color-element left in modern life\\" (31). Dorian is quickly influenced by Lord Henry's philosophy, aping to everyone else Lord Henry's views and words and acting out on them by plunging into the pits of hedonism.<br /><br />The portrait itself is a mirror of Dorian's soul. It was a \\"visible emblem of conscience\\" (96). As Lord Henry's pleasure seeking philosophy takes hold in Dorian's mind, he sees that \\"eternal youth, infinite passion, pleasures subtle and secret, wild joys and wilder sins - he was to have all of these things. The portrait was to bear the burden of his shame; that was all\\" (109). However, in with a horrible fascination, Dorian \\"grew more and more enamored of his own beauty, more and more interested in the corruption of his own soul\\" (131) for \\"what the worm was to the corpse, his sins would be to the painted image on the canvas. They would mar its beauty, and eat away its grace. They would defile it, and make it shameful. And yet the thing would still live on. It would be always alive\\" (122). Even though \\"the leprosies of sin were slowly eating thething away\\" (161) the portrait held on to its life of decay, just as Dorian held on to pleasure, refusing to be cleansed and beautiful again until Dorian's death.<br /><br />Quotes:<br /><br />\\"She was free in her prison of passion\\" (65).<br /><br /> \\"She tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy\\" (49).<br /><br />\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about\\" (4).<br /><br />\\"Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others. One's own life - that is the important thing\\" (82).<br /><br />\\"And how horribly real ugliness made things!\\" (128)eating the thing away\\" (161) the portrait held on to its life of decay, just as Dorian held on to pleasure, refusing to be cleansed and beautiful again until Dorian's death.  <br /> <br /> <br />Quotes: <br />\\"She was free in her prison of passion\\" (65). <br /> \\"She tried to look picturesque, but only succeeded in being untidy\\" (49). <br />\\"There is only one thing in the world worse than being talked about, and that is not being talked about\\" (4).   <br />\\"Discord is to be forced to be in harmony with others.

0060007737|5.0|A must read for anyone in business. You don't just read this, you keep it around for reference. It also helps if you have read previous books...especially from the mother of all Trout and Reis books on Positioning. To navigate the world of business, marketing and advertising without this body of knowledge is like trying to get around Boston without a map. It can be done...but.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|- I'm a owner of all of Neil Young's released material from buying Unplugged to 80s material 70s, 60s, to the present, my review is from the heart of a true fan. -  <br /> <br />This is Neil Young's best acoustic release hands down. Point out critical points. A Man Needs a Maid/Heart of Gold suite is awesome with slightly different lyrics on A Man Needs a Maid (the chorus). Heart of Gold on piano then going back and finishing on A Man Needs a Maid is a classic. Neil's voice hear is clear as a whistle, and the acoustic guitar is as well. Neil is like sitting in your home playing to you...I know thats a cliche' but its true ;o). Neil talks here and there, the story of the ranch for Old Man. He cracks a joke here and there as well. Talks about the Johnny Cash show, and the funny story about a song written for it.  <br /> <br />The DVD is video of the concert and video of his ranch/animals/photos of his old town. The video switches between the concert and the personal reflections of Neil which is great. The video quality of the concert is dark, and grainy, but the music and reflections carries the day. Great DVD, I fully recommend the CD/DVD. <br /> <br />Anyways, sum up everything. This must be in your Neil Young Library. You'll be playing this over and over until the disc melts in your CD player (don't think thats possible! lol.) If your a fan of good music just add this to your collection, you will not be disappointed.  <br /> <br />Highlights: Everything...
B000M5B6Q0|4.0|This CD has very good music. I didn't thik it would be that good since I wasn't sure if Hugh Grant or even Drew Barrymore can carry a tune. Very nice soundtrack. The combination of 80s melody with the new generation of music blends very well.
0786838655|5.0|My 10 yr old son enjoyed reading but never got into any chapter style books as they took too much time to get to the end.  Nothing grabbed his attention to the point that he wanted to do nothing but keep reading on.  This book, The Lightning Thief, had him hooked!  He even passed on his Xbox time to read!  A great book which pulls the reader into the story.  We can't wait to start the next book in the series! Highly recommended.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I grew up with Sean Connery as Bond -- and he is still fantastic. And so is Daniel Craig -- no one should be that handsome!  And he's a damned good actor, too. This is one of the best James Bond films ever -- I simply can't rule out \\"From Russia With Love\\" and \\"Dr. No\\" -- but along with those two, the new \\"Casino Royale\\" stands tall. Wish now I'd seen it in the theatre -- it's a non-stop thrill -- just enjoy!
1400064287|5.0|Made to Stick is an enjoyable read, but perhaps more importantly, it provides useful insights. While it pays homage to The Tipping Point, this utility is where the two books part company - in Made to Stick, there is actually information you can use, rather than just brain candy and cocktail party roughage. <br /> <br />The focus is on effective communication, but at a strategic level - how do you effectively communicate ideas -  rather than the tactical stuff you learned in your college communications courses.  <br /> <br />Key concepts included the effectiveness of templates in leveraging creativity, the importance of storytelling in creating stickiness, the concept of commander's intent, and the curse of knowledge. <br /> <br />Refreshingly, the book focused less on communication goals than on methods for achieving them - again workable templates/intellectual frameworks for delivery. <br /> <br />The book is well researched and supported by strong and pertinent anecdotes - these guys clearly took their own advice.
B000LC55F2|4.0|For reasons which other reviewers have already mentioned, it's hard to get very involved with these characters, and that's a problem.  However, the storyline is intriguing enough to keep you watching for the twist at the end.  I did enjoy David Bowie's understated performance as Nikola Tesla. <br />  If you want to care more about characters, however, try The Illusionist instead. <br />
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I love this movie, I'm pretty I didn't stop laughing the entire time I watched it.  I highly reccommend it.
B000MQC9H4|1.0|I love cute romantic comedies, but this movie was neither cute nor comedic.  I saw it in the theater with my friend and the only reason we laughed (before we walked out) was because the acting was so bad and the plot was incredibly contrived.  Don't waste your money on this move!
0743496728|4.0|I  will try to keep this short and simple: this is a very good book. I read alot and every so often you come across a book that you find very hard to put down. Nineteen Minutes is that type of book. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because I found that sometimes Picoult's ending of characters thoughts were a little too cheesy.  I can't quote anything because I don't have the book in front of me but I think you will see what I mean as you read it. Other than that, its a touchy subject that she manages to pull off without offending any sides. That is no small feat. Great book. Buy it and you won't be let down.
1582701709|5.0|Not only did I like the the book  I bought one for each of my children and  had to buy the DVD as well for them . <br />It is very inspiring  and up lifting and any thing that is postive and sends you on a postive path is great in my eyes. <br />I feel having the writen words in this  book is so inspiring  . <br />I would say buy it over and over again for your self and for the ones your love .

B000MNP2KI|5.0|Casino Royale is an excellent \\"rebirth\\" for the James Bond series, and fans won't be disappointed with the movie.  The movie kicks off with Bond acquiring his \\"OO\\" license in a great opening sequence filmed in black and white.  After chasing rogue bombmakers and preventing a terrorist attack at Miami-Dade Airport, Bond finds himself in Montenegro at Casino Royale for a high-stakes poker game organized by Le Chiffre, a financier for the world's terrorists.  Bond must win the game and stop Le Chiffre, or else MI6 will have directly funded terrorism.  Casino Royale serves as the perfect introduction for the new OO7, Daniel Craig.  The movie offers plenty of action, including the high-wire chase through a construction site  and Bond's fight to stop a bomb going off in the Miami airport among several others, but maybe most importantly, it is more realistic, more gritty.  The last few Brosnan Bonds used too many gadgets and CGI, but Casino Royale gets back to basics and overall it leads to a better movie.  Bond fans will not be disappointed, Casino Royale goes back to the tried and true formula that the early Connery films used, a secret agent who must rely on himself to get the job done, no gadgets or gimmicks.      When Daniel Craig was announced as the next OO7, there was an uproar by many fans who disapproved of the selection.  But in his first role as Bond, Craig shines as the newly-appointed secret agent with a license to kill.  Since it is the \\"first\\" introduction to the character, Craig's Bond is allowed to grow as a character, and we see what he becomes in later movies.  All in all, Craig has done a great job giving Bond his tough edge back, and it will be interesting to see how he continues to develop in the next films.  Eva Green is a different breed of Bond girl as Vesper Lynd, the treasury reprsentative who loathes Bond at first but comes to warm to him as she learns more about him and what's he capable of.   Green is very good in the part and provides a perfect challenge for Bond.  Mads Mikkelsen is also good as Le Chiffre, a financier who takes care of terrorists' money and puts together the high-stakes game at Casino Royale.  Judi Dench returns as M, Bond's superior who is pushed to her limit by her agent's actions.  In a very cool but small part, Jeffrey Wright plays Felix Leiter, Bond's CIA equal who finds himself at the poker table.  Also, Giancarlo Giannini plays Mathis, Bond's contact in Montenegro who may or may not be on his side.  Overall, a great cast for Bond 21.      The 2-disc DVD is a pretty good package for fans of the movie, but don't be surprised to see another edition released within the year.  It features a beautiful widescreen presentation on Disc 1 and saves all the special features for Disc 2.  \\"Becoming Bond\\" is a 26-minute featurette that shows the process Daniel Craig went through to become James Bond from the announcement all the way through filming.  \\"James Bond: For Real\\" details all the stunt work that went into making Casino Royale, and really makes you appreciate the stunts now that you've seen how they did them.  \\"Bond Girls are Forever\\" is a 47-minute documentary hosted by The Living Daylight's Maryam d'Abo about the history of the Bond girls that has interviews with several, including Ursulla Andress and Halle Berry.  Lastly there is Chris Cornell's music video for \\"You Know My Name,\\" one of the best Bond songs that I can remember.  While the extras are good, it feels like a lot more could have been done, so maybe hold out for a future release.  With the movie and the features, this DVD is can't miss.  Check out Casino Royale!
B00000IGGA|5.0|i would have to say that after rain dogs this is waits best album it show cases all his talents from hard rockers to ballads and delta- blues. this one really smokes put it up as soon as possible.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|If you're any kind of Neil Young fan, you need to buy this now.  Honestly, this is the best live Neil album there is, including Live Rust, imho. I was totally blown away; the sound quality is gorgeous, rich and full; Neil's singing and playing are absolutely top notch; there are several unreleased great songs; the other hits are performed so well.  A couple of favorites: the solo acoustic Cowgirl in the Sand sounds like a totally new song, and Bad Fog of Loneliness, previously unreleased to my knowledge.  The chit chat between songs will get old after the third listen, it's true.  Also, the DVD concert footage is forgettable but the extras are nice.  I read somewhere that his producer wanted this to be released instead of Harvest (he was just about to record Harvest, and many of the songs here are new to the audience), and that Neil now thinks that would have been a good idea.  That's how good this is!  Buy it now.
B000001FFJ|5.0|my friend if your even looking at this i can tell you that you have already waited to long. this album is like nothing you have ever heard and is one of my personal favorites.if you only invest in one tom waits album this should be it.
B000LC55F2|4.0|This was another great movie.A thinkers movie.You can't miss a minute--more indepth than 'the Illusionists\\" Seeing David Bowie come back to acting was fantastic in itself--All the actors are great-strong preformance by Jackman.A must have....
B000L43AN4|4.0|after listening to this for a while now i have to say that some of the music on this disc is some of the best tom has written and some of the worst. but of course with this much music you're bound to disagree a little bit. but the big plus of this one is it has something for everyone whether you like the ruff stuff disc 1, the ballads disc 2, or his experimental stuff disc 3, the thing most of even the hardcore waits fans dont like all 3 and when your paying 30 to 40 dollars for the cd thats a big deal. so i would reccomend this one after buying a few other waits albums.
B000M341QE|5.0|this movie was great--gripping--edge of your seat--I never would have guessed the ending--great story and fantastic acting....a must have

0783231202|5.0|This is a great film and a great story. The review provided by Amazon is one of the most self important pieces of drivel in the history of the world. This is a true story. They way it is told for the most part is true. For this person to write such a wrong headed and ultimately misleading review is ridiculous. Though it was not popular this is one of the great films of the last twenty years.  <br />The story of their struggle against, like it or not, evil Spainish slave traders is very important and has to be told. Also John Quincy Adams was very important to early US history. This was the last great accomplishment of an already great life. At the time he was the last surviving connection to the Founding Fathers.  <br />If this story was untrue I think I would hate the film. But it is true. This happened and that is what makes it so great.
B000006L53|5.0|This has to be one of the rarest CD Albums by Madonna, initially only for promotion, was then released commercially ONLY in Germany and the USA.  Some copies did circulate to other countries via importing.  Beautiful 3D cover that will take your breath away, compliments the actual contents of the CD - one of Madonna's best albums - EVER.
B00062ZE3U|5.0|My roommate discovered this band for us by watching fan videos online.  We instantly fell in love with Angels and that one song was the basis for me purchasing this whole CD for her for Christmas.  We listened through it together for the first time and we are hooked.  The beautiful lilting voice of the main singer is haunting and the instrumentation is quite amazing.  I was utterly impressed and have recommended this to most of my friends, several of whom are as addicted as I am to Within Temptation.
B0002Y4T92|4.0|There were a few guitarist that should have not been omitted from this DVD set, who played at the Festival. The Most disappointing omission was JEFF BECK!! He should have been on this DVD as well. There is not enough product of Jeff on DVD for us Beck Fans. All we have is the ARMS Concert and BB King Live by request. I hope Clapton decides to do a Volume 2 of this with the guitarist that were missing from the first set. But I still love seeing Buddy Guy cutting heads on \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\" (Robert Cray was right..you gotta keep your eyes on Buddy). Joe walsh was at his comic & musical best, playing his hits and commenting on how a song was dedicated to those who never had a song dedicated to them.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|1/2 star for that...4 1/2 stars for sonic beauty. Yes no DTS but it's OK 'cause the fidelity is like hummingbirds or something pure. Very organic sound. The DVD is just beatifully done. I got serious chills when I saw the \\"Old Man\\" of the ranch.    Thanks Neil,    Spoiler><><  [...]
B000EQ47GS|5.0|It's sad that I'm just now getting around to buying the remastered Boston albums, prompted by the death of Brad Delp. It's also comforting to read the recently added reviews, and knowing that his music affected countless others like it has affected me. <br /> <br />Regarding this album, I first picked it up on vinyl, then 8-track(!?), followed by cassette, and then on CD. It has followed me through all of the ups and downs of life, and I never tire of hearing it. I guess I have about 700 CDs, but this is THE best. <br /> <br />Brad's vocals are truly ethereal. It was funny to note how many people mentioned getting goosebumps listening to him sing; that's what happens to me as I listen to his voice fade out on \\"More Than a Feeling\\". I wish we had more Boston albums to remember him by, but the few that he did are works of art. Rest in peace, Brad, knowing that you brought a lot of happiness into the lives of people like me.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|Excellent movie. Watching it on PBS made me want to read the book and I now adore both. Though the movie does take a few liberties with the book, it takes fewer than most and still remains true to the spirit of an excellent book. Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson did, I think a remarkable job as Rochester and Jane Eyre and really brought out the many sides of their complex characters. The only problem I have with the movie is keeping myself from watching it too much!
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Earlier reviewers have accurately captured the essence of this 5-star masterpiece.  What a recovery after the disappointing 3-star Live at Fillmore which though nr 2 launched the performance series.  John, one of the earlier reviewers, wondered how the next generation takes these songs.  Well, I can not write for the whole generation but about two of its members, my two sons.  They love Neil Young's music.  I have a lot of music which they won't touch and they have music I just don't understand, but we are perfect agreement about Neil Young - he cuts across generations.  A 8-CD 2 DVD first archives release, 1963-1972, coming up later this year.  Can't match this career highlight but should be interesting.  God bless Neil Young.
0743496728|5.0|This may be the most important contemporary novel of the year. The author addresses a topic that has become unfortunately all too familiar--school shootings. Like the rest of Picoult's books, however, this is a complex story, and it is important not to jump to simplistic conclusions. The boy who shoots 29 people, killing ten of them, as part of a detailed premeditated plan was the victim of bullying all through his school years. This does not necessarily mean that bullying is the cause of a shooting rampage. Almost all kids recall being bullied at some time (so do I), and they might think, \\"I wish I could kill him (her),\\" or fantasize about doing it, but very few actually carry it through.  Not only that, school shootings are committed by others for other (often unknown) reasons, sometimes by total strangers or adults. The author picked one very realistic example of how this could happen, resulting in a totally believable story.<br /><br />You can't assume that having guns in the house will do it either. Picoult bends over backward to show that not everyone who owns a gun has it for the purpose of committing a crime. People hunt for sport, in the area in which the book takes place, people hunt for food out of necessity, people collect firearms or have antiques that have been in the family. Lewis, the boy's father, does everything to teach his kids about the responsible use of guns, to have respect for them, to follow  safety rules. He supervises his son when they go hunting. Ironically, the guns that the son, Peter, uses to shoot up the school, aren't even those belonging to his father, but stolen.<br /><br />In a bullying situation, where someone like Peter may be pushed over the edge, often adults seem clueless or simply don't know how to handle it. Often adult intervention makes the situation worse. Teachers at the school admit this and Peter's mother, Lacy, one of the densest people in the book, does her best to illustrate it. Adults also sometimes actually punish the kid who is being bullied, which Lacy also does. Peter learns quickly to expect no protection from adults.<br /><br />The character I am sorriest for is Josie, the judge's daughter, who seems to be a victim of mixed signals and  miscommunications all the way through. I can't give away the ending, but it might have made a real difference if her mother had just once been able to get through to her before it was too late.<br /><br />Finally, I liked the author bringing back certain characters from other novels, Jordan, Selena, Patrick--but I think Nina should have been left to rest in peace. Her story and its ending (I'm not saying which one) were so horrific that there is no purpose in mentioning her again. With that one the end is the end.<br /><br />Nineteen Minutes is a powerful title of an up-to-date, thought-provoking book. This should be THE book everybody's talking about this year. Not to be missed!punish the kid who is being bullied, which Lacy also does.

078322740X|3.0|This is a charming, light, sweet screwball comedy, with an excellent ensemble cast all wonderful in their roles.  Goldie Hawn beautifully plays a charming, off-beat con artist, whose pathological lying and skewed take on reality unwittingly lead her to bring about genuine love and kindness.  Along the way, she reunites a family; sheds light on the old flame of her \\"victim\\" Steve Martin (exposing the motivations of the woman who broke his heart); and creates two new families -- proving that, in the movies at least, you may be able to make a silk purse from a sow's ear. <br /> <br />The couple Goldie's character enlists to play her parents are delightful.  So are the small-town characters and situations.  Though the overall plot may be somewhat predictable, enough surprises are sprinkled throughout to make the film enjoyable watching, again and again.  Heartwarming moments, and the lack of the modern age's gross-out techniques, are huge pluses, to this viewer.  Fans of whimsical, somewhat innocent light comedy likely will enjoy this film. <br /> <br />Steve and Goldie have great chemistry in \\"Housesitter.\\"  Their roles here lack the sometimes-shrillness that marred their later pairing in the remake of \\"The Out-Of-Towners\\" (a film which did have some funny moments, by Steve, Goldie, and the hilarious John Cleese).  Well-written and well-acted subtlety make \\"Housesitter\\" a charming film to enjoy watching again over the years. <br /> <br />Steve Martin's wonderful dancing and physical comedy skills are not used a lot in \\"Housesitter,\\" but his great performance doesn't require them.  In fact, this role allows him to demonstrate his skill in pathos and dramatic acting.  (For a side-splittingly funny movie that showcases his excellence in dancing and physical comedy, there is the hilarious \\"All of Me,\\" whose wonderful cast includes superb performances by Lily Tomlin, Jason Bernard, Richard Libertini, and Victoria Tennant.) <br /> <br />
1582701709|1.0|This book is for people who are so sad and so messed up that they just need something, anything to get them back on track.  Duh, of course having a positive attitude is important.  That's not a secret.  That's in the Bible and it's just common sense.  I don't like the way this lady keeps referring to God as \\"The Universe.\\" God created the moon, the sun, the stars and all the planets.  Those creations are not God Himself.  Deuteronomy 4:19  And when you look up to the sky and see the sun, the moon and the stars--all the heavenly array--do not be enticed into bowing down to them and worshiping things the LORD your God has apportioned to all the nations under heaven.  God will supply all your needs, just as he supplied you with life.  I agree with the reader who talked about the happy little boy that died...as if he vibrated or attracted death to himself. Believing that people attract every negative thing that happens to them is sick.  Why should a victim take the blame for someone else's evil and hatred.  Everything bad that happens to us is not our fault.  Sometimes things just happen and it is not the victim's fault.   This book is dangerous. <br />

B0000B1OFL|3.0|The Italian Job was fun to watch. It was a good double-cross/revenge story that kept me thoroughly entertained all the way through.<br /><br />Kudos to Director F. Gary Gray for making such a good feature film when his directorial resume mostly consists of rapper videos. Gray's other most recent notable feature films were 2005's flop sequel to the classic Get Shorty (1995) and 2003's A Man Apart (which I have not seen).<br /><br />Storywise, The Italian Job really worked well. It had a good flow that kept you interested. There were way too many of the typical over the top Hollywood action film sequences that are just plain old unbelievable: cars driving down busy sidewalks at high speed; driving through a busy subway; people surviving sure-death situations; absolutely zero police response to what would realistically summon a cavalry of cops...these kinds of surreal action take a bit away from the movie.<br /><br />The cast is pretty good, and the acting is very good. The story is familiar enough as it is popular throughout the history of film: A heist is made by a group of thieves/one of the crooks goes rogue/the group seeks revenge.<br /><br />So if the genre is up your alley, then by all means The Italian Job should work for an evening of entertainment. And if you like it, you're in luck....A sequel has been announced for 2008 called The Brazilian Job with (mostly) the same cast and director (the most important aspects in a recipe for a successful sequel).<br /><br />Let's hope in the sequel that Gray keeps a better handle on reality. I'm sure that it'll be F.I.N.E.
B000M4RG42|3.0|When I saw the previews for Flags of Our Fathers, I was excited for a couple of reasons.  First, I am a World War II buff, but have studied the European theater and want to know more about the war in the Pacific - the so-called American War, as it was linked directly to an attack on Americans at Pearl Harbor.   <br /> <br />Secondly, my great uncle was a Marine involved in the island hopping campaign to reach Japan.  I have heard stories of what it was like and wanted this film to add to those stories. <br /> <br />While there were parts of the film that were interesting, the information was not woven together in a cohesive final product.  Little vignettes of action that were supposed to help tell the story of the fight for Iwo Jima end up being snippets of what is really one of the most compelling fights in American history, and the definitive Marine battle of all time.   <br /> <br />When you read the book, you really understand why the fight for Iwo was so important.  You find out why 70,000 men were sent to this little spit of land to fight and die.  The atrocities committed by the Japanese both before and during World War II are explained and add a prelude to the hell that the Marines knew they would face once they reached the beaches.   <br /> <br />The structure of the island fortress - considered one of the most heavily armed fortresses in history - is explained, giving the feeling that the Marines were lucky to win the battle, even after 36 days of tortuous fighting.   <br /> <br />The idea that the picture of the flag raising could give a nation hope is understandable, especially given the era and the painful four years leading up to the battle. <br /> <br />But the film - well, it just goes off in it's own direction, with Clint Eastwood's help of course.  Where do I begin?  Well, war is hell and not as simple as it seems from the history books.  OK - got that.  These men were not looking to be set up as heroes, but were thrust into the spotlight for the good of a voracious government war machine that needed heroes to convince the public to continue financing a horrendously expense battle for the benefit of the free world.  Check.  Life back home was not a bed of roses.  Roger.   <br /> <br />But none of that really tells the story of what happened at Iwo Jima.  It doesn't even really tell the story of what happened to these three boys at Iwo Jima.  It touches on the issue, but it leaves the battle as a secondary item on Eastwood's agenda, which seems to be to tell us that our young soldiers end up as grist for the public mill.  That the press uses a good story for it's own benefit, even if the truth must be distorted a bit.  That the government doesn't really care about the real truth as long as it can use the boys for propaganda purposes.   <br /> <br />Well, in case no one understands the history of WWII, the fight was one we had to win.  The Japanese military leaders were murderous in their techniques, their teachings, and their actions.  Find the book and read the section about the slaughter in China, before we entered the war, where 350,000 civilians were slaughtered in one month (correct, one month).   <br /> <br />If three young men could capture the hearts of the American people and move the war to a speedier conclusion, then that was more important than those three men and their privacy or personal feelings.  As Marines who professed to be fighting for the sake of their fellow Marines, they should have understood that wars are won (and fellow soldiers saved) on the home front as well as on the battlefield.  The personal sacrifices of the publicity tour at home were a small price to pay for the thousands of lives saved due to a shortened war.   <br /> <br />If only Clint Eastwood had been able to clarify that issue.  Instead he seems to want to show us that these poor pitiful boys were just pawns in the hands of the Corp and the US government.  What a wasted opportunity, however politically correct in this current age.
B00003CXS4|4.0|A few weeks ago I looked at Guy Ritchie's Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels (1998), and I was pleasantly surprised with what a good movie it was. So how could I resist picking up 2000's loosely tied in follow-on Snatch (aka Lock, Stock and Six Stolen Diamonds)?<br /><br />In Snatch, several of the actors are back from \\"Lock, Stock\\", but all playing unrelated characters along side Brad Pitt. The first few minutes of Snatch looked like it was going to be a cash-in imitation of Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, but Snatch quickly developed its own story and characters.<br /><br />Both \\"Lock, Stock\\" and Snatch are stylistically similar presentation-wise in a Pulp Fiction (1994) kind of way: Characters involved with various criminal activity are unaware of each other's presence throughout most of the movie, but then they are ultimately all connected by the closing credits.<br /><br />There is a lot of violence seasoned with a good amount of black comedy. The acting is great. Ritchie is a master at getting a realistic reaction out of his cast...not just to situations and shocking acts of violence, but to people. The way the cast reacts to Brad Pitt's character is as believable as it is priceless.<br /><br />Brad Pitt does a great job in this movie. I've seen a lot of criticism about Pitt's acting abilities, but I've got to say that I am mostly impressed with the roles that I've seen him in. And his character in Snatch, due to how well he played it, will stand out in my mind for a long time.<br /><br />Jason Statham is as good as ever too. Like Samuel L. Jackson, Statham always seems to be the same guy in all of the movies he's in...same persona. And it just works every time.<br /><br />Looking for a blast from the past with good actors, good action and a good story? Look no further. Here it is. Snatch may not be a collector's item, but it's worth the price.<br /><br />And check out Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels too if you've not done so already.<br />  <br />
B000002IM7|5.0|Kings X sounds like a fully mature band even on this, their first album- it is still one of their best.  The songwriting, engineering, and performance are all top notch, and of course, Mr. Pinnicks incredible voice and Ty's ripping guitar always deliver.  I've been a fan of King's X since Faith, Hope, and Love came out, but somehow I overlooked their debut until recently- it is now among my favorites!  Highly recommended for any fan of melodic rock with a Christian and uplifting message.
0440234743|5.0|When a wealthy billionaire dies and leaves a controversial will, it has his six known children in an uproar. These progeny are fairly useless members of society who were spoiled throughout their lives and would likely squander the fortune. The will indicates that the vast sum of his estate should go to a previously unknown child who happens to be a Christian missionary in the jungles of Brazil. The executor of the will dispatches one of his lawyers to find this heir. The lawyer goes through adventures flying in small planes, going down little known tributaries of rivers in Brazil, and interacting with native Indians there. He eventually finds her but she is uninterested in the inheritance having come to peace with living with the indigenous people there and sharing Jesus with them.<br /><br />Grisham succeeds in making her a sympathetic character whom the reader might like to meet in real life. The lawyer goes through a process of re-evaluating priorities in life and healing from past addictions and mistakes. One would consider him to have become a born again Christian. This is evidenced in his change in attitude and interests in helping a neighbor pastor and talking with God as well as reconnecting with his broken family. I'll not give away the ending but recommend the book as good fiction in addition to being a good way to examine priorities in life.
B000MEYJ0G|4.0|The second LCD full length is at once a more daring record, but also a more focused record. The most rewarding thing about the first album was the inclusion of all LCD's previous vinyl releases collected on the bonus disc. The  self titled debut itself was strong in places, but unfocused, and not much linked the various styles together. Here, on the new record, LCD is able to create a record that wanders through various styles and yet somehow manages to still work as a larger whole. Murphy's vocals are alot stronger, and the sound is overall alot fuller without being overdone. The slower songs are better, and  the digital madness more infectious than ever. Overall, it is much more focused and rewarding effort from LCD. Highly recommended for fans of the first album and newcomers alike.
0385340540|4.0|This story is that of a man who was once a powerful lawyer/solicitor in Washington D.C. but then got caught up with power and greed and consequently got in some major trouble with both the US government as well as those of several other countries. He went to jail for many years then as a president was going out of office, received an unexpected pardon. The CIA sent him to Italy to find out who would try to kill him to help them know more information about what he was originally involved in. (He of course does not know this part)<br /><br />He then proceeds to become immersed in the Italian culture and begins learning Italian. The CIA leaks his whereabouts and it is a race to escape. Through a series of spy like maneuvers, he eventually makes his way back to the US using someone else's passport. The book proceeds in thriller fashion with a decent amount of Italian culture incorporated. My only issue with the story is that it seems to end quite rapidly and takes some major leaps without working through a more realistic resolution. I read it just before going to Italy and it provided a nice primer to the culture.

1844137864|5.0|I have to make a fuss to pry people's attention away from Wall and Piece.  It's almost too good for a coffee-table book.
0321334876|3.0|I would consider this book somewhat useful, but readers should treat the suggestions in the book judiciously. Some of the suggestions are too trivial for advanced programmers. For example, \\"prefer const and inline <br />to #define\\". Every C++ programmer knows this! And this is also exactly the same advice clearly stated in Stroustrup's book \\"the C++ programming language\\". I think that the author is highly unprofessional by not citing Stroustrup who gave the same advice much earlier in the classic book that every C++ programmer knows. <br /> <br />Some suggestions in the book are not even correct. For example, the suggestion \\"never redefine an inherited nonvirtual function\\". This suggestion is incorrect. The author argues that the virtual functions should be defined. However, it does not need to. In some cases, redefine an inherited nonvirtual function is necessary, efficient, and the right way. For example, in the following case: <br /> <br />class A{ public void print() {cout&lt;&lt;\\"A print\\";};}  <br />class B: public A { public void print() {cout&lt;&lt;\\"B print\\";};}  <br />class C: public B { public void print() {cout&lt;&lt;\\"C print\\";};}  <br /> <br />A a; B b; C c; <br />a.print(); b.print(); c.print(); <br /> <br />In this case, the correct functions are called. More importantly, it does not need the virtual function and the dynamic binding to do that. So it is much more effecient that virtual functions. And efficiency is the main advantage of C++.  <br /> <br />Cleary, if redefine the nonvirtual function is a bad practice, the C++ standard would have already banned it. <br /> <br />This case applies to the scenario that the compiler knows the exact type in compile time. If you use pointers or reference, like <br /> <br />A *a=new A(); B *b=new B(); C *c= new C(); <br />Then only the \\"A print\\" would be the result of the output. <br />

1400032717|5.0|As the reader might know by now, this book relates the \\"adventures\\" of a 15 year old autistic boy who finds a dead dog in his neighborhood. The reader might also know (see the first review above) that Mr Haddon has apparently been able to represent very accurately the thoughts and reflections of autistic people. When I started to read it, I knew the same. <br /> <br />The main reflections that come to my mind are: <br />- The book is written in the first person. Christopher (the autistic boy) is the main character and \\"author\\" of this work. This is what really makes the book so interesting, since it is what has allowed Mr Haddon to explore the boy's thoughts. <br />- Yes, the main story behind this book is Christopher's investigation about the dog's death. However, two other themes surface. On one hand, Christopher leverages the story to share with the reader his thoughts and life experiences. He sort of wanders while narrating his investigation. And this takes us to the other theme, which is Christopher's own life. He is the only child of a British couple (living near London) and his autism has brought some stress to his parents. Mr Haddon does a great job in unconvering \\"leaf by leaf\\" some difficult situations in Christopher's life, through the kid's own perspective (different from non-autistic people). <br />- As a result of the above, this work brings to the reader a carroussel of feelings and thoughts, as he/she begins slowly to submerse him/herself in Christopher's own world and life. Sometimes its just funny, sometimes its hearbreaking, other times its warm, and so forth.  <br /> <br />As an advise, I suggest you read this book if you want to try something different while entertaining. It's a quick read of 221 pages. You will read it fast and will enjoy it. My only concern is if you are looking for a mystery novel (at its heart, it is not) or for a psychological piece about autism. This is \\"just\\" a very humane and smart book written from the perspective of anautistic teenager (no small feat in hindsight). <br /> <br />Enjoy!
B000LXH0AE|4.0|Stranger Than Fiction does something not many movies have done for me in recent memory.  It made me care about the main character.  Harold Crick has a problem.  He's hearing a voice that narrates his every move.  As irritating as this may be, it gets worse once the voice announces that he is going to die. <br /> <br />And so the plot has been set in motion.  Harold is an IRS agent, a nice enough guy, but lonely, and hated by the people he must audit to do his job.  You can't help but feel sorry for him, and even root for him.  He really is one of the most likeable characters I've seen in a while.  Will Ferrell surprised me with his ability to evoke sadness and was better than I expected.  I was thinking while watching him how Jim Carrey could have easily filled the role as well, only because it reminded me of his character in Eternal Sunshine, but but it was nice to see that Ferrell can act as well. <br /> <br />The rest of the cast did fine, but none of them really had much to sink their teeth into.  Hoffman didn't really have to do anything, he was just himself.  Emma Thompson was adequate as the alcoholic author with writer's block.  She looked terrible but her voice is very pleasant as the narrator.  Maggie Gyllenhaal is adorable so it's easy to see why Harold falls for her. <br /> <br />Overall, a well crafted story.  It almost felt at times if Spike Jones were to direct a romantic comedy, this is how it would turn out.  Or maybe I'm saying that it felt a little Charlie Kaufmanesque.  Either way, it's a movie that makes you feel good.
B00005JPGO|5.0|I am going to keep this review relevant to the movie and the reasons why you should buy this on DVD:<br /><br />1. Leonardo DiCaprio's Performance: This film in my opinion features the best ever performance extracted from Leonardo DiCaprio on film. He is flawless here as a South Africa white who needs to discover whether material wealth means more to him than human emotion and sentiment. I have never been a huge fan of Leo (though yes, he was wonderful in \\"What's Eating Gilbert Grape\\" and \\"The Beach\\") but this film alongwith \\"The Departed\\" really opened my eyes. Granted he is a physically splendid creation, but his use of language, intonation and emotion were at the forefront of this movie, and the only downside to his performance is that it totally overshadowed the other actors.<br /><br />2. Djimon Hounsou's performance : This was an actor I first noticed in \\"Amistad\\" and he just keeps getting better and better. He is one actor who looks about 25 even though hes well past 40, and has an incredible range. His role as a traumatized father looking for his son in the middle of riot torn Africa will be remembered years to come, however, he is not as radiant as Leonardo here, and for that reason alone I think he is thought of as a \\"supporting actor\\" here. If you pay attention, you will actually see that he gets MORE screen time than Leo.<br /><br />3. Jennifer Connelly : I think she is one of the most ill-utilized actresses we have today, and the director doesn't do much with her here either, which is a pity. However, her role is quite effective for what it is - the downside being that she has zero chemistry with Leo in every regard.<br /><br />4. Cinematography : The effect here was to present Africa as a beautiful nation though ridden with political problems and woes. To see these violent images portrayed against a backdrop of the most gorgeous sunsets and tropical rainforests was a bit bizarre - which I suppose was the effect. The visuals are lush and evocative, and captures the mood of the era and environment perfectly.<br /><br />5. Direction & Story : The director knew a good thing when he saw it. This is a very character driven story and you have to FEEL for the characters' emotions if you want to get anywhere. On the surface, its a simple tale thats been told a million different ways, but the political statements this movie makes is way ahead of its' time, I thought (much like the Angelina Jolie starrer \\"Beyond Borders\\" which was a masterpiece in its' own right).<br /><br />It goes without saying that Leonardo DiCaprio carries this film on his capable shoulders and takes you through almost three gripping hours of it without making you look at your watch. This is what real acting and filmmaking is all about. If you do decide to buy this, let Leo be your number one reason.<br /><br />To wrap it up, this is a must have 2-DVD Edition of the film - and I can state that this is one movie you will be watching over and over. I saw this just after \\"The Departed\\", which is the only other movie this year I could possibly watch again.

B000LC3ID8|4.0|*Saw III* is gore galore!  You're going to see broken bones, ripped flesh, twisted flesh and bones and many more.  You'll even see decaying pigs turned into liquid. This film is definitely not for the squeamish.  I had to look away from the screen a few times.  The crime scenes you seen in CSI are G-rated compared to what you'll see here.  As a warning, don't eat while you're watching this film because you'll definitely lose your appetite.<br /><br />Jigsaw is at it again...except that he is dying.  Once again, Amanda (the sole survivor of Jigsaw's games from the first film) joins Jigsaw.  In this film, you'll see just how much Amanda is involved and why she holds Jigsaw dear.<br /><br />A doctor has been kidnapped to keep Jigsaw alive.  As long as Jigsaw is alive, she'll stay alive.  If he dies, she dies as well.  Meanwhile, a man has been kidnapped and is going through a game.  This man lost a son to a drunk driver and has since been obsessed with vengenance.  In this tailored game, he has to decide whether to forgive certain people or let them die in their own games.<br /><br />As I said before, Jigsaw is dying.  Amanda is emotionally unstable.  The doctor does everything to keep Jigsaw alive.  The grieving father is advancing towards his freedom.  Just who makes it out alive?  Who dies?  Just like the first and second movies, there's a twist.  The twist is so good that you won't believe you didn't think of it before.<br /><br />*Saw III* is a good movie that is just overloaded with gory stuff.  They make be fake but still, they can make you really squirm in your seats.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|I am going to keep this review relevant to the pros/cons of the movie, and inform you of the reasons why you should buy this movie on DVD:<br /><br />1. Martin Scorcese's Best Movie Ever : No, Im not kidding, I frankly think this is the best picture he has ever directed. I know some people thought that his Oscar was undeserved for this film, but I am positive this is his best work - even ahead of his DeNiro arc and the brilliance of his later work with DiCaprio. I think that even though this remains a remake of an Asian film, he gave it enough personality of its' own, and that his directorial style finally moved toward being less mainstream, and more artistic. Never has bloodshed seemed so sudden yet so inspired - violence reaches levels unlike the cartoonish depictions of Tarantino's work - what Martin achieves here is pure cinematic poetry.<br /><br />2. Leonardo DiCaprio in his second best performance of all time : Leo has always been a directors' actor, and I still think his greatest performance of all time has been in \\"Blood Diamond\\" (another instant classic). But his performance here where he overcomes his own acting limitations to literally 'become' the character he plays is admirable. Leo has it all - raw sex appeal, acting chops, and an uncanny knack of knowing how to give the camera his best shot - plus his troubled performance as an undercover cop here is head and shoulders above some of the more early dramatic performances he excelled in (eg \\"The Beach\\")<br /><br />3. Matt Damon as a slimeball : I loved his negative turn in \\"The Talented Mr Ripley\\" and his character here, while not as weird, is certainly equally disturbed and foul. Matt's pretty boy looks translate very well when he wants to play a negative role, and his performance here won me as a new fan. I never really thought of him as much of an actor either way, but his performance here was admirable to say the least.<br /><br />4. Mark Wahlberg as a foulmouthed cop : I have never heard such foul language from one character in a film in forever, so listening to Mark Wahlberg here was shocking - you must watch this if only to be startled by the language he uses!<br /><br />5. Jack Nicholson in one of his most humorously dark roles : It is hard to take his character seriously but watching NICHOLSON in a SCORCESE movie (!) itself was worth the price of admission. He has such hilarious one-liners and the best screentime. As usual, he walks through the role, and his presence here overshadows everyone, including the luminous DiCaprio in most scenes.<br /><br />6. The Story : Everyone pretty much knows that this tale is about everyone betraying everyone, but to see it played out and watching everyone reach their unique and very sudden deaths was a treat in itself!<br /><br />I must say, I am not usually a fan of violent movies, but the fact that this film made me embrace the genre readily was quite a revelation. Why? Well I have to hand it to Scorcese - he has taken what was pretty much a basic cops and baddies tale and revolutionized it with his clever direction and some excellent dialogue. Also, hes gotten the best actors to work with him, so thats great.<br /><br />Another thing - the film holds up very well on repeated viewing. This is an excellent film to watch again and again - and actually gets better upon repeat views (I've seen it three times, about to watch it a fourth, and am still excited about the prospect).<br /><br />To sum this up, \\"The Departed\\" is easily Scorcese's best film because its one made for this generation, while respecting the film making techniques of the past. Its bold, brash and unnerving, and extracts the best performances from its' leads.<br /><br />Special mention must be made of the male lead - Leonardo DiCaprio. Never before has this actor looked this good on screen - age works its' wonders - and last year saw him in two of his greatest films of all time. This is one actor who I will be watching in every one of his future films,and if its enough - should be the only reason to pick up this DVD.<br /><br />Timeless and endlessly re-watchable, \\"The Departed\\" needs a place in your DVD library. You'll be watching this one again and again - for years.f his future films, and if its enough - should be the only reason to pick up this DVD. <br /> <br />Timeless and endlessly re-watchable, \\"The Departed\\" needs a place in your DVD library. You'll be watching this one again and again - for years.
1932100660|5.0|I was a confirmed Atkins addict. I LOVED my meat. And carbs have always been a bit \\"bad\\" to me.  <br /> <br />But then some health problems crept up and I started to rethink my diet.  <br /> <br />By some random circumstance, this book was sent to me by someone - and my life was truly changed. Now dieting to lose weight seems almost silly and changing your diet to be healthy makes the most sense in the world. When you eat the right foods, everything else falls into place: diet, health, mental well being.  <br /> <br />Since following the suggestions made my Dr Campbell and his son, I have lost several pounds, my health problems have almost disappeared, I've taken 5 years of my face and I feel phenomenal. Better than I have in a long time! <br /> <br />This book is amazing and will change the way you view food - completely.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|Two women. Two failed relationships. Two houses. One great romantic comedy. The Holiday is the story of two women, Iris (Kate Winslet in a poignant performance) and Amanda (Cameron Diaz), who swap houses for two weeks thinking it will help them get over their relationship problems. Amanda will take Iris's house in a small cottage just outside of London, and Iris will stay at Amanda's house in L.A. They will both meet someone who will help them mend their heart.<br /><br />Let's get one thing out of the way: Yes, this is a chick flick, but a damn fine one at that! I'm not much of a fan of the genre, nor of Nancy Meyers' films, but when I saw this in theatres with my girlfriend last December, I loved it. I thought the film would've lost some of its charm on second viewing, but it hasn't lost one bit of it. With a running time of 136 minutes, you'd think it would drag but it feels like a 90-minute film.<br /><br />The film has a few surprises and most of all, a great subplot around Arthur's (screen veteran Eli Wallach in a brilliant performance) character. The film goes back and forth between the two relationships, the one in the UK and the one in the US, which gives it a great rhythm. Nothing seems forced and it doesn't fall into the typical clich&eacute;s of the genre. The dialogue is very well written, kudos to Meyers for that. The characters are interesting; Winslet (my favorite actress) shines in her role as Iris, the girl who falls for the wrong man. I usually avoid movies starring Cameron Diaz and/or Jack Black like the plague, but they were both really good in that one. Jude Law brought some class to his role. The supporting cast was very good (keep your eyes open for a cameo by a famous actor in the video store).<br /><br />Overall, The Holiday is a very enjoyable film and you don't have to love romantic comedies to enjoy it. It's closer to Something's Gotta Give than What Women Want, and it's much better this way. Check it out, you won't be sorry!
B000MTPANQ|5.0|I have never written a review and I have never made it a point to purchase an album on the day it came out. But, I had a feeling about this album.  <br /> <br />Simply stated, this album is an instant classic <br /> <br />
B00004TDTO|5.0|I never saw Jaws in the theater. When it was released I was only 7. So I always watched it on VHS full screen. When I got the Widescreen DVD it was like watching a whole new movie. I had seen the full screen dozens of times, but this was different. It flows smoother, as the screen doesn't flip flop between characters as they talk, because they can appear on the widescreen together. Also gone are people and objects being cut off on the sides. Yes, it was like seeing the movie for the first time. <br /> <br />Now I always buy widescreen. <br />
1582701709|5.0|THIS is a beautiful book that accompanies the powerful and life changing DVD by the same title. <br /> <br />The Secret presents dramatically and meaningfully one of the Universe's oldest laws - the Law of Attraction. <br /> <br />Author Rhonda Byrne has come along to make the message clear and relevant to today's human problems. She succeeds. <br /> <br />She presents case histories to show the age old Law actually works. And the authors and teachers she features demonstrate truthfully how the Secret can bring about real positive change. <br /> <br />The book addresses how the Secret can impact on relationship, career, financial and indeed health issues - bringing about real life almost miraculous change through the power of thought and intention. <br /> <br />The companion book is easy on the eye, powerful and well thought out - a perfect reference book as the reader sets out to use the Secret's principles in his or her life. <br /> <br />While there is nothing new in the philosophy behind the Secret, the presentation has captured the minds and imaginations of many. My fifteen year old son applies it every day - and it works for him. We have all seen the changes first hand. <br /> <br />This is an essential book... it does actually work! <br /> <br />
B00005JKLZ|5.0|I have read Well's book and seen the older movie. That said, I love this movie. Guy Pearce is very convincing in his role. <br /> <br />We see a man in love. When he looses that love, he uses his genius to try and save her. Failing to do that, he embarks on a quest to find out why. When he gets his answer, he realizes he has found a new life, and to leave the past in the past. <br /> <br />I thought the ending, with the past next to the future, was well done. <br /> <br />And Orlando Jones role is entertaining. <br />

B000I5X81K|5.0|Josh has really stepped forward in this album to show more of his personal taste and abilities in music, rather than doing what we all alreayd know he does well.  I loved all fo the tracks on this CD.  Some may complain that it is too contemporary or something, but I love it.  It's nice to see a different side of Josh and still be totally enthralled.
1582701709|4.0|This instructional book is very easy to follow. You'll find you can read it in one sitting. However, some of you may want to take notes (I did) so it will take a bit longer. Similar to other books teaching you to manifest your own destiny, it reaffirms that the best course for your life is one you create with vision and belief. I found the section on gratitude particularly comforting.Keep an open mind and you will find this book is exactly what it says it is, a shared secret.Copyright© KatherinesCorner.com-for Amazon.com
006085880X|2.0|First of all, I love Jodi Picoult.  I think she handles difficult subjects well and is very good at conveying despair and disbelief. But she has already written a similar story (Mercy)about sucide and while I bought the ending in Mercy due to the small town atmosphere and very clear facts I flat out refuse to believe the ending in this book as remotely realistic. This ruined the book for me. I have a degree in Criminal Justice, but even if I didn't, anyone who watches Law and Order knows that the circumstances in this book are pretty clear cut legally.  Sad, but clear cut. I know that Ms. Picoult is a good author and not afraid of difficult endings,(My Sister's Keeper).  Why take the easy way out with this book when she could have produced a thoughtful, if painful narrative of how the real world sometimes works?
B000MRA5NS|5.0|I picked up this movie today and was hooked the second i put it in.  The movie is fast paced and keeps you on the edge of your seat the entire time. The new Bond does not let you down at all.   The picture is amazing and it will have you looking on in awe at the action on the screen. Blue ray shows its guns well here as i did not notice and picture problems at all, if you want to show off your blue ray player this is a good movie to do so with at 1080i, and i'm sure it looks even better at 1080p.
B000HCO840|5.0|I have been a big fan of all things Marvel so when I had heard they were making another x-men (without Bryan Singer) I was worried but, I am haply to say I'm glad they did - i enjoyed this film (apart from some deaths which I could have done without) the Director managed to do one thing to make me smile - right at the start we got to see a fastball special by Wolverine and Colossus - even if I hated the rest of the movie it would have been enough  as it shows there is a Fan Boy within the director and I'm all about the fan boy elements! I know there was a lot of talk against this film before it came out but the box office shows it did well<br /><br />I give it Double Top Dogs<br /><br />P.S Come Home Anna!
B000ICM5VW|5.0|This presentation is flawless. The Picture is astonishing, and audio is dynamic and clear. This and MI3 are a must have for any HDDVD owner.
B0002BO0HG|5.0|I consider my self lucky enough to get to know  Antony's music, especially this album reminded me the feeling of something powerful, something that stays in your mind forever  like The Wall-Pink Floyd or Grace-Jeff Buckley or led zeppelin III(list goes on). this album is an instant classic -if you are open minded toward music you should get this one.
B000J4QWNQ|4.0|If you like Micheal Mann's style of directing then you'll enjoy this movie. No Dolby TruHD soundtrack but the Dolby Digital Plus is quite sufficient. The presentation is very  clean and sharp, truly a great representation of the HD format.

B000LC4CVA|5.0|WOW!!!!!!!!!  This is a great product... It is so beautiful with the castle background in Ireland and with the lights and camera angles, it just makes it all the better.  <br />I would recomend this product for those who love or just can't get enough of these beautiful women and also for those who don't even know who Celtic Woman is... This is alot better than the first one that they did, but the first one is still spectacular in it's own why. <br /> <br />To tell you the truth I think it deserves 6 stars not just 5 stars!!!!!!
B000M4RG42|4.0|CLint Eastwood continues to be a fine director and brings out the best in an average cast and in large action sequences.  This film is a clever perspective of war and the propaganda that surrounds it.  It is good entertainment, thought provoking and well edited.
1582701709|1.0|Ok, hear is the \\"secret\\", a positive mental attitude is important. Yes, I agree with that. Research does, in fact, show that being optimistic helps you in many ways. However, trying to get thin by \\"thinking thin thoughts\\", and ignoring the fact that the person is killing themselves with trans fats, MSG, and a host of other toxins in their fast food laden diets is a travesty in health.  <br />I am sure millions of people will continue to buy this book. if for no other reason that they can convince themselves that it is ok to eat at McDonald's for breakfast tomorrow.  If they gave a negative five stars I would have picked that.

Please, can someone post an actual review of the DVD. Thanks.
B000J4QWMC|4.0|Michael Mann is one of my favorite directors in Hollywood. Mann's unique talent to create interesting characters and great police stories is hard to match, but few things are missing in his new effort.<br /><br />Story:<br /><br />The 80s dynamic duo is now Colin Farrell (James 'Sonny' Crockett) and Jamie Foxx (Ricardo Tubbs) who are undercover cops trying to bring down drug lords who have international operations. As they work, they find themselves going deeper into their operations and things get personal after a while. That's basically it. The movie is very confusing to follow due to the \\"cop talk\\" and sloppy editing. Mann is known for creating excellent character development in his movies, but unfortunately that's not the case here.<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />Apparently Mann was focused more about his colorful style than the actual plot of the movie. Undoubtedly, there is some traditional \\"Mann\\" style cinematography that many of his fans will enjoy, but don't expect the storytelling of \\"Heat\\" or \\"Collateral.\\" Some might say that there is a miscast problem. Farrell and Foxx are suitable for their rolls, but I cannot say that about Gong Li. It was hard to understand her dialogue. The movie was shot in digital video that gave Mann more freedom to shoot at night. There are some remarkable scenes where you can see clouds in the night and that's something that you can never get in traditional film. Digital filmmaking is something that Mann has been using for a while. Unlike \\"Collateral,\\" Mann used digital cameras even for daytime in this movie, giving it a DV camcorder look.<br /><br />If you want to see a movie like this, you're expecting action. When it comes to police action and drama, Mann has no match. Even though, the actions are few and far between in this movie, he delivers those scenes with crude reality and power. The last action scene of the movie is intense, it reminds us the robbery shooting from Heat.<br /><br />The Verdict:<br /><br />The 80s are gone forever. The white suit and the pastel colors are also gone. Mann delivers a raw, stylish and uncompromising film, but it lacks the storytelling and the character development that he is known for. I recommend this movie to his fans, other people, you might get bored.ver. The white suit and the pastel colors are also gone.

1582701709|1.0|Let's say something first: if it makes you feel better, you can even  believe in Santa Claus, and there's no problem with that.  So, if you want to believe what Rhonda says, it's up to you.  For me, there are too many lies in this book.  They are appealing, because we all search for an easy way out. They sounds beautiful, like birds in the sky. But they remain lies.  They are also immoral:  I think one of the best teaching in christianity is compassion. Compassion means to feel the suffering of another, to understand him deeply. It's the feeling we all feel when we see a baby cry for apparently no reason, so cute and so defenseless.  We feel his pain, we think we have to help.  But if you believe that feeling (mental) pain attracts to you disgrace, how can you embrace compassion?  Also, why help others if when they are in struggle it's all their fault? Why try to help them if you believe that their minds are responsable for that?  When we think of World War II, and Nazism, are we going to say that all the Jews were vibrating in a bad mood? I don't think it's a good answer to the evil that men do (and what about 9/11, or Katrina?).  Were all the people in the '60 anti-war movement creating more war? Vietnam was caused by John Lennon? Don't be a fool.  The poet says: the good sailor moves the sails, for he knows he can't control the wind.    I take this very personal. When I was just a kid, a friend of mine died. He was the happiest child in the world, we were shocked and thought about death for a long long time. He didn't attract his bad destiny, and we didn't attract anything, except tears.  Leave this book alone.    P.S.  There's no need to say that the quotations of great men in the past are largely  distorted. Take Bhudda: he spoke all the time against desire of material things, and he thought a lot about illness, aging and death. It's easy to take a quotation out of context and gain noble fathers for a poor idea.  Peace.
1932100385|4.0|This book presents a mountain of population data obtained in China comparing diet and health between people living in rural settings and those living urban settings. Further, it draws conclusions and makes recommendations on diet and health. The first part of the book presents the data and reaches reasonable conclusions, but the last part of the book decends into almost a polemic. Overall, I found it extremely well presented and informative.

B00005QW5X|5.0|This is my husband and I's movie, much in the same way some couples have a song. We saw this by accident on cable, and quickly became \\"Hed Heads\\" -- playing the soundtrack non-stop in the car, quoting lines, hanging the movie poster in our office. We've been movie geeks before, but more of the traditional Star Wars or Scarface variety. This movie was something else. <br /> <br />The music is kick-a** and the filmmaking is amazing (especially since the director was a first-timer). Your heart will break, your spirit will soar, you'll rock out. It's all good, and there's a poignant lesson about self-acceptance and identity in there too. Our only regret is that we never saw the show live.  <br /> <br />Check out the extras for some interesting info on how the stage show developed, and to catch some tender moments with John Cameron Mitchell and his supportive family.

Proof that idiots are in control of the music world! If you can listen to Octavarium (a 24:00 masterpiece) and not have the hairs on your neck, back, legs, stand on end; you must be lifeless. Incredible....EPIC even... Can't wait for the next one. The Zeppelin of the new millenium.

It's even more wonderful, and I can watch them continually.  They have beautiful, beautiful voices and their band and background singers are equally as good.  It's a performance not to be missed!
B0002IQJUK|5.0|Gavin Degraw's CD Chariot is the type of CD that you can listen to over and over again. Its fusion of different genres allows this CD to appeal to a wide range of audiences and demographics. The songs tell a story of love and love lost and gives you the feeling that you are actually walking in his shoes. Although the beats are great, Gavin's voice and writing ability are the selling points for this CD. This is evident when you listen to the stripped version which is an acoustic set of all his songs. This added CD alone is enough reason to purchase this CD.

I say are because when you see the video, they are.. just as usual... fun, and full of a special greatness rarely seen in this world. Anyone who enjoys their music will definitely enjoy this offering.. It's packed with interviews of each of the Beatles and members of their inner circle like their producer George Martin. The production gives one a rare look at some wonderful video and personal insights on the Band and each of it's members.. it's a 10 out of 10 winner for sure..

0374105235|5.0|An extraordinary book by an extraordinary person.  Ishmael Beah's story is haunting and inspiring.  I had awful dreams for a few nights after reading this book, the horrifying images of some of Mr. Beah's experiences etched in my mind.  Yet I was very much aware that the few sickening incidents in the book which haunted me were the tip of the iceberg for what Mr. Beah had endured.  The book does an excellent job of describing and pacing the reader through some of these atrocities, describing the incidents effectively but not in so much detail that you cannot keep reading. This book shows that the kindness of a few key people can change a life in profound ways, and inspired me to be that person for someone else.<br /><br />Every sentence of this book captured my attention.  The only frustrating part was that it seemed to end prematurely.
B00069YE0W|5.0|this is an absolutely amazing CD!Frusciante really nailed it on this one. This has a very melancholy sound to it that makes it all that more beautiful. the CD gives you the feeling of sitting quietly with J.F. and listening to him play his music, it is incredible!
B000KCHZK6|3.0|To be honest,Not Too late is no way as good as her first 2 albums which were awesome.I would recommend this only for real fans of Nora Jones,or else check out Emiliana Torrini's albums instead.
B00005JNS0|5.0|Great for young and old. I love this movie. I watched this on a long flight two times a row! I bought this for my 4 year  old nephew and 10 year old niece for Christmas and they love it. I even got my 30 year old self professed \\"CARTOON HATING\\" fiance to admit that it was awesome. That is major. Everyone should check this out.
B000EHRVP6|3.0|Luckily this movie was not as gory as I feared it would be, even this unrated version.  I did like the growth of the main character Paxton though a lot of questions remained at the end about him.  The overwhelming problem with this movie is that I just couldn't feel any empathy or sympathy for the three male characters the movie focuses on.  The most sympathic one, Josh, is still difficult to feel much about because his history is vaguely discussed -- better than the other two whose histories are barely discussed.  I couldn't understand the killers either -- no attempt was made to explain them beyond one or two scenes.  Nameless and purposeless violence isn't scary to me so if the movie was meant to scare, it failed.  If the movie's intent was to show how far some people will go to get a thrill, the lack histories for characters damaged it.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|This version of Jane Eyre has stolen my heart completely. The chemistry between Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson is amazing. I can't wait to see what these two wonderful actors will do next. I'm totally smitten with both of them in this movie. I had only seen the second half of it on PBS, and decided to order the DVD so I could see the beginning of the story. I was not disappointed, although I must say Jane doesn't get to say much in the beginning. But since she has such an expressive face and such beautiful eyes and fresh dewy skin, she is forgiven. The love story is as pure and real as you can possibly get with a film. I will watch this over and over and over again...

B000MNP2KI|1.0|Getting tired of this from Sony.<br /><br />Bought the 2 disc set and disc one, the main feature, will not play on my Toshiba DVD player.  THOUSANDS of other DVDs do, but this one will not.<br /><br />It plays on my DVD-ROM on my PC, but I prefer to watch films on my couch in my living room on a 32 inch screen, not at my office chair on a 19 inch monitor.<br /><br />The second disc, the disc with supplemental material, plays fine.  But disc one does not.  I returned it and swapped it out at the store TWICE in the past 24 hours and I have the same problem each time.<br /><br />WTF????<br /><br />SOMEBODY explain to me why this happens!  Is there something on the DVD itself?<br /><br />If the manufacturer/studio added extra files to prevent copying, but they end up confusing the tar out of my DVD player, then you can tell Sony that I will go out of my way to find a bootlegged (read: PLAYABLE) version of this disk ASAP.<br /><br />Sony can kiss my grits.
B00005JNS0|5.0|What a GREAT movie for children and adults alike.  This is one that every home should have in their DVD collection.  It is sure to be a CLASSIC.
B000GCFO0I|5.0|This film was very impressive.  The acting was good, the plot was very interesting, and the characters were really creepy.  I have watched many horror films for many years and this one was one of the best!  I never been scared with other flicks but this movie really gave me goosebumps and   scared me a little.  I saw this movie in the theater and I was definitely pleased.  It is rare nowadays to see a horror movie with substance that's creepy enough to give a tough adult nightmares.   <br /> <br />The mother of a young girl goes into a old, burnt town to find her missing disturbed daughter that ran out of the vehicle after a car accident near the entrance of the town.  The mother explores this seemingly vacant town and discovers many strange buildings and people. Just when you think the movie won't get anymore interesting, she enters a church and finds a hiding place of town folks that can help her find her daughter.  To find her daughter, she must confront a creepy, evil possessed girl that is guarded by creepy disfigured demons (dont' think they are demons but they  aren't human).  The movie then climaxes into a more detailed plot surrounding supernatural events that I've never seen in other movies.  I am being vague so that you can see for yourself how this movie unravels. <br /> <br /> This movie was definitely unique and I will never forget it (I tend to forget movies as soon as I watch them). <br /> <br />This movie is worth watching.
B000NA28IE|1.0|The novel-and now movie- was a piece of junk, and the movie sucks as well; it was basically Star Wars in Middle Earth. Boy(aka Luke Skywalker), with a dreams of being someone(Jedi), becomes the last of a breed of Dragon Riders(aka Jedi). He becomes under the teaching of a former Dragon Rider, Brom (aka Obi Won Kenobi). As he trains and outta nowhere learns magic, he finds out of a trapped princess(aka Leia). Disregarding his mentor, he goes to save her and in the process, one of the evil kings henchmen(aka Darth Vader) kills Brom. He goes for a final battle at the end. Sound all too familiar?? With lack of depth and originality and realism, this bogus fantasy disgraces the name of fantasy and the book or the movie shouldn't exist.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|This movie gives so much perspective to how human beings treat our home.  Earth will not heal itself over night we have to take part in that.  I know many scientists agree that the Earth goes through cycles of changes over the course of thousands of years but this movie shows that it is happening so much faster than we thought.  The facts presented in this movie cannot be made up they are true.  So many people feel that why should we even bother we won't be here but your kids' great grandchildren will be here.  So regardless if you are demo/repub/indie I think we all can agree that we want the best future for our descendents.

Wahlberg acts like wood, Jack like prime ham. Story and direction flow like a river of  swearing mud. Oh dear - 75 minutes in and nobody wants to carry on watching. <br /> Raging Bull, Casino, Good Fellas, Kings of Comedy - a strain of gold and those were the Oscars not this and \\"the Gangs of New York\\". I can only assume your other reviewers have been watching a different film

Both times, I had the option of the super saver next day shipping.  However, for whatever reason, I did not receive the free shipping and paid $25 for shipping.  The method to go about getting the free shipping is very confusing. <br /> <br />Thank you. <br />Terri Dowling

B000MNP2KI|1.0|It looks like Sony is at it again. <br /> <br />There are some strange extra files on this disk, and it won't play properly. <br /> <br />A box opens up telling you to press play and the disk will start your player, but it doesn't. <br /> <br />After the spanking they received after their last sneaky trick, you'd think they would have learned their lesson. <br /> <br />Fool me once , shame on you. <br />Fool me twice, shame on me. <br /> <br />I'm getting my money back for this disc, and will never buy another Sony product again.
B000HIVIOW|5.0|I rented this at the video store & my 2 1/2 year old son just loves watching it.  He is not interested in watching much TV so I am so grateful that he will sit in his little chair for the whole 1/2 hour of running time.  He's seen it 4 times now & every single time he is completely captivated by it.  I might be buying it so I can have those 1/2 hour breaks once in awhile.  It is a very adorable short movie.
B000J3EEBY|4.0|While I love McKennitt's music, that she plays a lot of the instruments, and that she diaries her travels and gives the meat behind the songs, there is nothing new on this new CD.  But there are some old things missing....like anything with harps.  I miss the harps, Loreena...
B000005KQT|5.0|There are no bad songs on this overview of the career of maybe the greatest blues harp player of all time.

B0001CCXZW|5.0|I got hooked on this show because a friend said \\"You should watch it.\\" <br />I love seeing the old EP and the Pilot which is in this collection. Three or so EP's into the season you meet Chris, Rory's father. You also meet his parents and you are soon glad they have nothing to do with Rory. I feel for her a little knowing how it feels having family that don't have anything to do with you for someone elses misstake. Emily says it best when she cheers her granddaughter up with the misstake caused problems, but she is loved. Mother and Daughter are a roit as they bounce off eachother. Luke is great from the pilot on and I'm glad they decided to make the dinner run by Luke insted of Daisy. Great show and I own all the seasons out so far
0393312836|5.0|You would think that it would be impossible to write a book about a 15-year old rapist/murderer and somehow have him come out as a sympathetic character.  Burgess has achieved that remarkable feat in this book.  The genius of it is in the use of the first person and in the use of slang to give voice to Alex.  The slang also serves to make the violence almost comical as instead of kicking someone in the mouth, Alex describes giving a tolchok into the rot and knocking out a few zoobies.  So even though the book is full of violence and rape, the language removes us from it in such a way that the book feels less violent than it is.  Although this may seem like it would make the book hard to read, it all makes sense when read in context.<br /><br />The story itself is a fairly simple and fast read.  If you have seen the movie then (other than the last chapter) you know what happens in the book.  Alex and his friends commit violent crimes, Alex gets arrested, he gets cured of his violence and then gets cured of the cure.  The movie follows the book almost exactly.  The key difference is that the original American edition left out the last chapter (the American publisher thought it was a sellout as Burgess explains in the introduction) and Kubrick followed the American edition of the book.  Is the last chapter a sellout?  Does it cheapen the book?  I think it changes the story to some extent.  Burgess suggested that it changed the book from a fantasy into a novel.  I think this overstates it but if you have read the American edition without the last chapter then you need to read it again with the last chapter.<br /><br />The book is a classic and should be required reading.  Although adult in concept and story line, anyone old enough to read the daily paper is old enough to read this book.  Beneath all the violence in the book, Burgess is trying to make a point about free will and what it means to be human but he doesn't overstate it.  The story and the language carry the reader and the message is just there to do with as you please.  As Burgess says in the introduction, \\"Eat this sweetish segment or spit it out.  You are free.\\"arry the reader and the message is just there to do with as you please.  As Burgess says in the introduction, \\"Eat this sweetish segment or spit it out.  You are free.\\"
B0007PALZ2|4.0|This was a great and often scary film. Much better that I expected. Brad Pitt delivers his best performance Since \\"Meet Joe Black\\". Very intense....and very strange....but great none the less. Give it a look...You won't be sorry. 4 Stars.
0743270754|4.0|The title conveys the fact that Lincoln chose the most able men for his cabinet, including several rivals that otherwise might have been political opponents. Lincoln's apparent ability to see past previous differences of opinion and embrace an opponent as a member of his team was unusual, and probably helped the North's cause during the Civil War. <br /> <br />Like today, politics were driven more by business and economic interests than social needs or morals. How else can \\"all men be created equal\\", but slavery be allowed to exist for 100 years? The American Civil War didn't begin because of the North's insistence on abolishing slavery, but rather the North's desire to maintain the Union as a whole, while eleven Southern slave states declared their secession and formed the Confederate States of America. The South was concerned that slavery wouldn't be allowed in new states that were joining the Union. <br /> <br />Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation was as much about being able to add black soldiers to the North's army (to help win the war) as it was to free them. The 13th amendment \\"finalized\\" the president's edict before it could be readily overturned after the war. <br /> <br />What I liked: <br />I learned a lot about the era and the social/political realities surrounding the war. The book presents an interesting discourse on the political scene leading up to and surrounding the civil war. <br /> <br />What I didn't like: <br />Too long - I'm a slow reader, and 750 pages of details caused me to skim a lot of the \\"social scene\\" topics. Also, the author seems to be a Lincoln \\"groupie\\" -- too much adoration -vs- unbiased presentation of info. <br />
B00005JO9J|4.0|It was very exciting. However, 9 episodes, that was too short. I wanted more from it. Looking forward to season 2.
1932100385|5.0|I have just finished this book, but I have been a vegan since chapter 3!  I cannot express how my life has changed in that time.  After 12 months of serious illness I have a new energy that I cannot explain.  I am a nurse and thought I was knowledgeable when it came to nutrition.  I can only say that I have had to completely rethink the industry lobby groups messages that have pervaded almost all nutritional information I have ever received.  This book will not only change your mind on what a healthy diet is, it will change your life.  Oh, and buy an extra copy .. you will want to give one to all those you care about!  I don't believe I have ever read a more compelling book.

B00006AW2P|4.0|...I agree with many of the critics who think the Rolling Stones 1963 singles would have made for some nice, but necessary bonus tracks. Otherwise a good debut from the boys. There are some great tracks here, like Not Fade Away, Route 66, I Just Want to Make Love to You, Honest I Do, Little by Little, I'm a King Bee, Carol and Tell Me. But, later in the album the boys start to run out of gas. Can I Get a Witness, You Can Make It If You Try and Walking the Dog are pretty weak. Also track 5, Now I've Got a Witness is filler.
B00005JM4Z|3.0|Pretty good flick. Much better than I expected. Pretty decent story line. Fans of the first will definetely enjoy this. Tyrese Gibson can act...Who knew ? Great action, and all the car chases you can handle...probably more. Eva Mendes is nice to look at...as always, and Cole Hauser is cool as hell...as always. If hot cars, hot girls, great action and a better than expected story are your thing....Give this a look. A generally good film. 3 Stars.

B0000VCZKM|1.0|This version of Annie is dark and mean-spirited.  Carole Burnett plays a <br />nasty drunkard Miss Hannigan with no redeeming qualities.  The child playing Annie looks the part, but her acting is not great.  People try to  <br />kill Annie in this movie.  It may be true to the cartoon, but it's not something I want my daughter to watch. <br /> <br />The Disney version is far superior, though it takes a few liberties and deviates from the standard script, including a budding romance between Warbucks and his secretary. <br />Audra McDonald is luminous, Victor Garber is the father everyone wishes they had, Cathy Bates and supporting cast are funny, and Alicia Morton is believable and sincere. There is even a cameo appearance by Andrea McArdle, the first Annie on Broadway.  Unless you are a true cynic, the Disney Annie will tug at your heartstrings.  If you want a nice video with positive values to share with your little girl, the Albert Finney Annie isn't it.  Get the Disney Annie instead. <br />Don't waste your time on the Albert Finney version.
B000E6UK5K|3.0|Very quiet album, few good guitar solo.  David has still a crystal voice, very relaxing to listen to.  It is not a Pink Floyd album, so don't expect it to sound like a Floyd album from the 70's. <br />This cd is different from what I was expecting, but I have to say that after few listenings, I like it, good for relaxing !

But there are some gems, like Around and Around, Confessin' the Blues, Time Is on My Side, Good Times Bad Times and It's All over Now. But there's too much filler in the second half, like Under the Boardwalk, Grown up Wrong, If You Need Me and Susie-Q, as well as Empty Heart from early on. For the hardcore Rolling Stone fan only.
B000MRA5NS|5.0|I received Casino Royale today from Amazon via Prime shipping (so fast!). This is the first Bluray movie I have watched on my Sony KDS60A2000 projection tv. When I saw this movie in the theater last November, I thought it was one of the best Bond movies ever (Dr No, Goldfinger, For Your Eyes Only, and most of the other Sean Connery versions are the best in my opinion). Daniel Craig, to my surprise, was the best Bond since Sean Connery. Anyway, this movie on Bluray is INCREDIBLE. The clarity is such that I honestly thought I was looking directly at the ocean in the Bahama's scenes. If you like Bond and have a 1080i TV, this is a MUST have!
B00004RH1E|5.0|Not sure what the other reviewer was talking about.  There are not really other products that will do a better job for less.<br /><br />Without bit the driver is about 3 3/4\\" when it is collapsed. The driver is good quality with little play in the sleeve.  The sleeve turns smoothly.  Not really sure what would do the job better for the price.  Take a look around these drivers are usually at least this price without any bits.<br /><br />The bits are good quality with square corners on the points.  I like this type better because it tends to slip less in a Phillips head.<br /><br />The case ... well that is hard plastic with a hinged cap.  Nothing special but I did not buy this for the case.  That said it is not horrible either  just don't throw it against a hard surface and you should be ok.
1582701709|5.0|\\"The Secret\\" is a tool to assist people to focus on whatever makes them happy.  I like the idea of not dwelling on the negativity in our lives, it exists, we just do not need to dwell on it.  It is well written, using repetition to assist us in remembering the context. As a result, I have a \\"thank you\\" rock by my bedroom door and everytime I wake up I am reminded to be grateful.  I now give more to society. I feel so much more in control of my thoughts.  Thank you, Rhonda Byrne, for this enlightening book!
0060557818|3.0|Perhaps it's just that I read this book in-between reading A Separate Peace and The Life of Pi, but I couldn't help but be disappointed by the the author's writing ability.  Good ideas, but not well executed.  I hoped to be moved and captivated like I was when I read Clive Barker's Imajica, but the author isn't able to invest his characters with enough depth to make them memorable.
B000002UAU|2.0|Dear oh dear, was this really what my parents were grooving to in '67 ? Must say that Rubber Soul, Revolver and also Abbey Road have stood the test of time much better than the mixed bag that is Sergeant Pepper's. I agree with one of my fellow reviewers that this album has been over-rated to quite a ridiculous extent. Songs like \\"When I'm 64\\", \\"Fixing a hole\\", \\"Getting better\\" really make for a rather embarrassing listen 30 years down the line. Guff is guff, even when it's produced by arguably the greatest pop group ever. And it's one of pop music's more enduring mysteries how the hell that guff ever ended up on an album that also features brilliant song writing like \\"Lucy in the sky\\" or \\"A day in the life\\".  <br /> <br />The notion that Sergeant Pepper's was the first time \\"a rock album was accepted as art\\" is also nonsense of course. By 1967, Frank Zappa and/or The Mothers of Inventions had already produced Freak Out!, Absolutely Free and Lumpy Gravy. Surely these albums were a bit more than mere collections of songs...(and sure enough, they were recognised as such by the more perceptive people in and outside the music scene). In my opinion, Sergeant Pepper's denotes the point where the Beatles left the field where they were unsurpassed - writing first rate pop songs - and made their first attempt at something more \\"arty\\". 30 years down the line, that attempt certainly did not result in a masterpiece. At best, it resulted in a failed masterpiece.  <br />
B000A7DVR2|5.0|If you can overlook the \\"F\\" bomb, this is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen.  You have to have the right sense of humor.

B000002KKX|5.0|This debut album by Christopher Cross is definately his very best work and a masterpiece. His albums that would follow, would never reach the status of this one, in quality and his best work. Every song on this album is great and actually, this album in itself, could be considered his greatest hits, in my opinion. I just love the sound of all of these songs and it brings back vivid memories of 1980, which for me was an exciting year, anyway. I'd definately recommend it to anyone that loves late 70's-early 80's soft rock.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I still remember my family driving to see \\"Mary Poppins\\" in the theater, the first time we went to see a movie off base, and passing another theater where they were showing \\"Goldfinger.\\"  There across the marquee was the naked and gold painted body of Shirley Eaton as Jill Masterson.  I do not remember whether it was Sean Connery or the 007 logo that provided the proper coverage at the right point because that sort of detail is not important when seeing a naked woman covered in gold paint.  \\"Goldfinger\\" was the third film in the James Bond series and an important one because it was the first in the franchise to really emphasis all of those marvelous gadgets of Q and the beginning of the tongue-in-cheek approach to the character favored by director Guy Hamilton.  I never saw \\"Goldfinger\\" in the theater and I want to say that I saw \\"From Russia with Love\\" first, but it could have been \\"Thunderball.\\"  I do know that from \\"Thunderball\\" on I saw all of the Bond movies in the theater through \\"For Your Eyes Only,\\" after which I just waited for them to come out on DVD.  I did that with \\"Casino Royale,\\" the 21st Bond film, but on the basis of what I see here I thin I will have to see the next offering in the theater.<br /><br />Whether you want to call this \\"retooling\\" or \\"rebooting\\" a character, what the producers did by casting Daniel Craig as the sixth James Bond and making him grittier and more realistic was a risky proposition.  I still think of Sean Connery as THE James Bond and while I greatly preferred Pierce Brosnan's comic take on the character to that of Roger Moore, the Bond that I thought was headed in the right direction after Connery was Timothy Dalton, who had the hard edge that was missing since the original.  In retrospect you can see Brosnan as being a combination of (or compromise between) Moore and Dalton, but with Craig they are really stripping down the character.  The opportunity was provided by the producers getting the rights back to \\"Casino Royale,\\" the first of the James Bond novels which had been made into a television drama on CBS in 1954 and then a comic romp anticipating Austin Powers in 1967 with David Niven and Woody Allen.  But the idea that this is the \\"first\\" James Bond movie, because this is where he gets his double-oh status.<br /><br />The adaptation by the team of Neal Purvis and Robert Wade (\\"The World is Not Enough,\\" \\"Die Another Die\\"), and Paul Haggis (\\"Million Dollar Baby,\\" \\"Crash\\"), updates the novel but keeps to the main plot.  Originally Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) was a SMERSH agent running a baccarat game at a French casino to raise the money he lost in a failed attempt to establish a chain of brothels.  Bond is assigned to beat Le Chiffre because he is an expert baccarat player so that SMERSH will kill him.  Now the game is Texas hold 'em poker (which today everybody knows, whereas baccarat still confuses me), and the money was lost in a stock manipulation scheme thwarted by Bond.  They kept Judi Dench as M, which is a no-brainer as far as I am concerned because the tension between her and Bond is even stronger this time around, but we never see Q (the comic relief of John Cleese would not fit the film's tone) and M's assistant is now male (Tobias Menzies) instead of Miss Moneypenny.  There are still the sexual innuendos, but they come across now as serious attempts at seduction rather than as lines designed to get a laugh in the theater. Like the character, these bon mots now have an edge to them (e.g., the line about not giving a damn if his martini is shaken or stirred gets a laugh when you see the trailer, but not in the context of the film itself).<br /><br />Supposedly the decision to have the grittier Bond came before the casting of Craig, whose work in \\"Road to Perdition\\" and \\"Munich\\" made it clear he could do it (check out his work in \\"Infamous\\" as well).  This \\"Casino Royale\\" is an action film and this Bond does not waste a lot of time talking (the eyes have it), although thelargest segment of the movie is spent playing high stakes poker.  That is sandwiched between the two key action sequences, which are the \\"free running\\" chase through a construction sight in the first act that ends up as a gun fight in a foreign embassy, and the big fight in a rapidly sinking building in Venice.  In between there is a nice minimalist knife fight, the attempt to stop a bomber and what is apparently a world record for clipping a car.<br /><br />I had to stop and think about what the action sequences were, because it is the fireworks between Bond and Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), the HM Treasury agent who is financing his seat at the poker table, that are most memorable (even if it takes an hour for her to show up).  When they first meet and she deflects his verbal sparring, he looks her up and down and reads her like a book.  But the fun part is when she does the same to him.  The idea is not so much to come up with the ideal woman for James Bond or for him to finally meet his match as it were, but rather to explain (if not justify) the character's infamous treatment of women.  I was pretty sure I knew where this relationship was headed, but they did go one twist father than I anticipated, which was a nice touch and another way in which this film succeeded in exceeding my heighten expectations.  I especially liked the torture scene because it played to my belief that if the torturer does not break you then they are the one that will end up dead for failing to break you.<br /><br />The extras are decent enough, although I was sort of expecting more given they are all on the second disc in the set.  \\"Becoming Bond\\" goes through the story of how Craig go the role, although after seeing the film you have to laugh at those who scoffed at his choice.  \\"James Bond: For Real\\" looks at decision to do all of the stunts \\"for real\\" as opposed to relying on super toys and computers.  Then there is \\"Bond Girls Are Forever: A Closer Look at Bond's Leading Ladies,\\" hosted by Maryam d'Abo (\\"The Living Daylights\\"), which talks to most of the them and reminds us why Ursula Andress and Honor Blackman are still at the top of the list (bonus points for considering Dame Judi a Bond Girl too).he movie is spent playing high stakes poker.

B000MNP2KI|5.0|This movie was so much better than any other recent Bond movie.  By getting rid of the silly gadgets, the silly one-liners, and the over-the-top plots, this movie obtains what others in the series are lacking - some degree of realism.  Because the characters are believable, and because from the beginning it's clear that the typical formula has been thrown out the window, then this edition to the franchise achieves what others are sorely lacking, namely suspense.  I was on the edge of my seat the entire second half of the movie.  Highly recommended.

B00005OAIE|4.0|The writer 'Rickey Wright' should admit that he doesn't have a CLUE about what 'music' is! I suppose being a tone deaf ignorant dolt with zero musical talent or taste is what qualifies as an 'editor' LOL! <br /> <br />Comparing Mayer to Dave Mathews is hilarious. I suggest the writer try to sing a DM song.. hmm can't think of a melody line? That's because they are impossible to sing (unless you are DM!). Mr Mayer has his own distinct voice - and far superior voice and melodic sense than DM IMHO - and on top of having a serious musical pedigree - John Mayer is a major talent.
B000I2J5UG|5.0|The box is larger than expected.  The CD has an extra song not stated in the list of songs.
B00005JNEI|5.0|They heckled him... well, of course they did.  He is dead right about what's going on.  I don't think it's spin.  I don't think it's overly biased.  It seems so left wing because it's about issues we don't know about.  Therefore, it seems extreme.  If this stuff was common knowledge to the citizens, it'd fall right in middle and would seem so absurred.
B000002L5P|5.0|I went into Tower Records in Monterey Park, California in 2003 searching for a good 80's album.  I noticed The Smiths albums, and remembered my sister talking about them when we were teens.  I never really paid attention at all.  I bought the Smiths debut, went home, and played it.  I immediately fell in love with the first song, Reel Around the Fountain. I played it over and over and over again, thinking: \\"This is the most beautiful song I have ever heard.\\"  Honestly, never had a song have such a huge impact in my life and how I felt.  After hearing Reel Around the Fountain repeatedly, I continued on and heard the whole album.  I became ahuge Smiths fan. I was interested in everything from that band.  The lyrics, the music, everything.  I heard and bought the rest of the albums and heard them chronologically.  I loved them all.  I saw an interview of Morrissey expressing himself about how he felt about the New York Dolls.  He mentioned that at some point in your life you come across a band than you instantly connect with and you never let them go, and thats what The Smiths are for me.  This album is my favorite and I will always cherish it, since it has impacted my life so much.

B000LXH0AE|4.0|... Is that it's a Will Ferrell movie, and it's actually good! <br /> <br />I've never been a fan of \\"Saturday Night Life,\\" or any of its recent escapees. I've drank no Kool-Aid there. But Ferrell's Harold Krick shows a level of intelligence and maturity you'd never expect him to have. He's not some crass, overgrown child pretending to be a grown-up. He is a grown-up. A real, sympathetic, and still serious role. <br /> <br />Krick lives a controlled, but drab life as an IRS auditor. Until one day he hears a narration voice in his head. He discovers he's a character in a novel, one which will eventually kill him. Emma Thompson is the neuorotic author Kay Eiffel and Queen Latifah is her somewhat protective assistant. Added into the mix are a delightful Dustin Hoffman, and a less delightful Maggie Gyllenhaal. All still put on a tremendous effort. I also enjoyed the continual phantom numbers and calculations, interesting touch.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|I felt younger listening to this great cd/dvd compilation.  I am now eagerly awaiting the '8 cd 2 dvd set\\", which is advertised in the cd/dvd, to be forthcoming later this year. <br /> <br />Thanks Neil for letting this gem out for us to relish and share.  Now if we can get a CD release of TIME FADES AWAY, the great live album which hasn't been available for years. <br />  <br />
B000M5AJQS|2.0|To put it bluntly, this movie is crap.  Not crap because of the actors, but crap because the director ripped it right off of the Hong Kong masterpiece Infernal Affairs, and did it without giving a shred of credit to the ORIGINAL FILMMAKERS.  For shame Marty, but it's ok, you're a typical American - unoriginal, uninspired, and ultimately, a thief. <br /> <br />Noone from the Hong Kong films got any mention or credit from Marty or his minions, except for the half-hearted under the breath mutter of acknowledgement to Andy Lau at the Oscars.  And oh by the way Marty, it was a CHINESE film, NOT a Japanese film that you ripped off.  At least get that right. <br /> <br />These two films are so alike it's creepy.  Departed added a couple of new, but pointless, characters, and based it in Beantown.  Aside from that, the film is Infernal Affairs. <br /> <br />This is my opinion.  I know most people \\"loved\\" the film and thought it was so fresh and wonderful.  Guess what?  It's recycled, courtesy of Marty and Hollywood, just like the other 98% of the movies coming out of Hollywood. <br /> <br />Enjoy this movie.  I certainly didn't.

6304712936|5.0|Of the main characters in the film, the only one that initially made sense to me was F. Murray Abraham. And, what a performance he gives! His Salieri is worth the price of the DVD alone.  <br /> <br />On the face of it, Tom Hulce and Elizabeth Berridge were miscast. This is a serious piece and I didn't think either had the depth as an actor to pull it off. But, both did - especially Hulce. He goes from Mozart's childish confidence in his superior abilities, never for a moment thinking perhaps he should be a bit more circumspect, to the agonies of depression and illness.  <br /> <br />It was love of this film that made me visit the Mozart house in Vienna last year. I felt that the apartment the film showed the Mozarts living in looked too big, too grand for people like them who were 1) middle class (if there was such a thing in that day) and 2) always having money problems. The actual apartment has quite a few rooms but they are all much smaller than the film suggests.  <br /> <br />The other interesting thing in Vienna was that the Mozarts married in Stephansdom cathedral - truly one of the most elaborate and beautiful churches ever built. I wish the film had shown even a little of its magnificence. <br /> <br />This is a movie of great depth but also a wonderful choice to introduce people to classical music.
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|I am only able to give this movie 5 stars- but it deserves 10. It is an absolute joy to watch. I figured out much of what was going on early in the movie {I thought}, as I believed the Police Inspector was in on the ruse; but when the Inspector goes to arrest the Illusionist, and he is not there, it is like getting struck by a lightning bolt, and you realize that you have become part of the story. But figuring out most of what was happening did not take away from the enchantment. It is so well done, it is mesmerizing, and you cannot help but admire the director and everyone involved, and its hard to wait for it to end, so you can immediately start it over again {and again and again.}It pulls you into the movie so strongly you feel you have become a participant. The cast is superb, as are the characters, and if Edward Norton never makes another movie, his place in film history as a great actor is guaranteed. Paul Giametti the Police Chief is simply delightful, as always. Rufus Sewell who portrays the crown prince, actually BECOMES the corrupt heir to the throne of an empire, to perfection. This movie absolutely deserves every Oscar there is. In a time when accountants and Wall Street types seem to believe they know more about the making of a movie, this diamond slipped through their grip.<br /><br />Maybe there really is some magic still left in this world.
B000J103X4|5.0|IN MY OPINION, THIS ALBUM IS ALMOST AS GOOD OR JUST AS GOOD AS HIS DEBUT. EVERY SINGLE TRACK IS GOOD, MAYBE EXCEPT FOR \\"REMEDY\\". THE GAME TRULY HAS THE WEST ON HIS BACK AND IS ONE OF THE BEST MC'S IN THE GAME RITE NOW. THE LYRICS ON THIS ALBUM ARE VERY GOOD. AND WITH HIS VOICE AND BEATS, MAKES PERFECTION.
078401213X|1.0|I am an avid movie fan. I have more than 4000 movies in my collection. By far, this was one of the most terrible, unwatchable movies I have ever seen and typically, I am very forgiving about quality and content on most films and rarely ever rate a movie so poorly.<br /><br />As a 30 year career engineer, I had no trouble with the concept; it is the awful production, direction and script of this movie... as if it was filmed, written and performed by a teenager in their garage. This movie is not worth using as a beverage coaster. Save your money.
0385474547|3.0|SPOILERS AHEAD:<br />This novel was set in the Igbo homeland in what is now southeastern Nigeria in the late 1800s/early 1900s. I read about three-quarters of the book before I could begin to appreciate it.<br /><br />Up to then I'd disliked the main character, Okonkwo, an important person in the village whose major traits were harsh anger, pride and inflexibility, finding him one-sided and uninteresting. I felt the description was plodding and little of importance was happening, and wasn't greatly interested in the village life. Much of the novel was concerned mainly with his point of view, and his interactions with the other, relatively minor characters were unexciting. When a dramatic event occurred, such as his accidental shooting of a villager that led to his exile, it was described in a flat, undramatic tone that seemed inappropriate and puzzled me.<br /><br />I couldn't help comparing this novel unfavorably with another I happened to be reading, Palace Walk, by Naguib Mahfouz, with its complex, many-sided protagonist, the many other strongly developed people in his family, the dramatic interaction between them, and the rich world around them that was reasonably familiar.<br /><br />It was only after reading some background material on the Internet that I could begin to understand how Achebe's novel aimed to recreate a vibrant culture that had existed before colonization on its own terms, with its oral tradition, rituals and taboos, and guardian spirits, and show what had been lost. The focus on a period before colonization and the depiction of the whites as interlopers has been called innovative for its time. Likewise the use of language in the words of the villagers, instead of pidgin.<br /><br />A scholar of African lit, Bernth Lindfors, has described the book like this: \\"Instead of representing Africa as a barbarous wilderness where savages lived in a permanent state of anarchy until the white man came bringing peace, law, order, religion, and a 'higher' form of civilization, Achebe showed how Africans led decent, moral lives in well-regulated societies that placed strict legal and religious constraints on human behavior. Indeed, according to Achebe, things did not fall apart in Africa until Europe intruded and set everything off balance by introducing alien codes which Africans were then told to live by. Europe did not bring light and peace . . . it brought chaos and confusion\\" (from the preface to the Anchor Book of Modern African Short Stories).<br /><br />At the same time, Achebe showed how some elements from outside the traditional culture, such as Christianity, weren't merely imposed from above but appealed strongly to some of the Igbo, especially those at the bottom of the society, and those who felt the new religion was more powerful. And he showed that the traditional society had its own internal problems and was ripe for change. Achebe himself has been quoted as saying, \\"My sympathies were not entirely with Okonkwo . . . . Life just has to go on and if you refuse to accept changes, then, tragic though it may be, you are swept aside\\" (from Under African Skies: Modern African Stories).<br /><br />The conventional action came almost entirely in the last quarter of the novel, when the encroaching missionaries, together with the trading culture and the colonizers' threat of force, began to overwhelm the village. Although I still can't say I identified with the main character even by the end or liked the style, by then I could better appreciate the loss of the village culture.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|This is an enjoyable CD- soft and soothing, with attention to Celtic detail, harps, violins, and soft irish tones make you close your eyes and visions of grassy knols, and castles come to mind.  I highly recommend this CD it makes me relax and feel happy.  A real breath of Spring.

B000H305U0|5.0|FutureSexLoveSounds truly showcases Justin's talent not only as a performer but as a serious musician and songwriter. The Justin on this album is not what you would expect to hear. The dance oriented music merged with hip hop and funk bring this album to a new level for Timberlake. On his sophomore attempt he has risen the bar and gone from stuggling post boy band era artist to established and respected pop star. Songs such as \\"What Goes Around\\" display his skills as a songwriter and hit maker. Justin is not afraid to take risks with such songs as \\"SexyBack\\". \\"Damn Girl\\" is a James Brown inspired tune where Justin's voice is soulful and the beat is pure funk. \\"My Love\\" features rapper T.I and solidifies JT as an R&B artist. Producers such as Timbaland and Will.I.Am as well as Justin himself create a piece of work that is musical genious and cannot be missed.

If you only read one work regarding case study research this should be it.  Yin is probably cited more frequently than any other author in the field.  This work really covers the waterfront and can serve as a guidebook to one wishing to engage in case study research.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|This a really outstanding performance, especially if you like the \\"sensitive\\" Neil of the early 70s. Three songs are previously unreleased by Neil Young: \\"On the Way Home,\\" \\"Bad Fog of Loneliness,\\" and \\"Dance Dance Dance.\\" Two songs are from the great never-issued-on-CD _Time Fades Away_: \\"Love in Mind\\" and \\"Journey Through the Past.\\"<br /><br />The set starts off light, with the tossed-off \\"On the Way Home.\\" I'm not surprised that this wasn't released; it's not bad, but it's not very good either. Then follow \\"Tell Me Why,\\" \\"Old Man,\\" \\"Journey Through the Past\\"... and a knockout solo version of \\"Helpless.\\"  Emotionally, it's just downhill from there: every song gets a little darker and more helpless than the last. You can really feel the Doom Trilogy years stretching out before him. It's compelling listening!<br /><br />The \\"suite\\" is interesting - it seems as if \\"Heart of Gold\\" started out as the middle-eight of \\"A Man Needs a Maid.\\" If he'd kept it that way, he'd never have had his only #1 hit. \\"Maid\\" and \\"There's a World\\" both fare much better for the lack of orchestral overdub bombast that sunk the album versions.<br /><br />\\"Bad Fog of Loneliness\\" starts off a little perfunctory, but veers darker and better. It's nice to have it out.  The acoustic versions of \\"Down by the River,\\" \\"Cowgirl in the Sand,\\" and \\"Ohio\\" are really amazing, as good as the full-band versions in their way.  \\"Dance Dance Dance\\" lightens the mood at the end of the encore. It's slight, but very effective in context.<br /><br />My only complaint is that tracks begin with the stage banter relating to them, so you have to sit through two minutes of chatter before he starts singing.  I'm glad it's there, but I'm going to have to make a music-only edit for normal listening.  I like having the stage banter, but it would be best to have it on a separate track from the song, I think.  A very minor complaint in any case.<br /><br />The DVD has great bonus material - song lyric manuscripts, Johnny Cash Show videos, etc. - but the concert video itself isn't very good. You see much more footage of a running reel-to-reel tape recorder than of Young. The cameraman obviously has no idea what he's doing. When you do see Young, he looks freakish. (Partly due to his posture - he had a crushed vertebra during the tour and was wearing a back brace.)

B000H8SFMK|5.0|The Pogues \\"If I Should Fall From Grace with God\\" is a masterpiece of its kind. Can not go wrong with this one. I feel a little sad that this band could not stand the test of time but I do realize that true genius is unpredictable at best and you can tell that the lead vocals is one of the type of genius that anything can happen. This is a tight band with that special flavor that comes from their side of he world. No weakness here, when these guides get going all hell breaks loose and I am looking to get drunk and buy a pack of Marlboro Reds and maybe take away the filters, that's how rowdy the s..t gets. A true pleasure to own. Ownership satisfaction do not get any better than this, can get to be the same but not better. This album stays in my world till I kick, and everytime I throw a party it definitely enters the rotation but right around the time when the party has heated up. This is no lukewarm affair and should not be considered as such. Get the Babes happy and drunk, get the dudes saturated with some high quality tap beer or whatever, really, and let loose the whole album. Stick with friends when playing the Pogues at least this way the fighting that might ensue will be in good cheer and later friendly hugs! 5 stars for the Pogues \\"If I Should Fall From Grace With God\\" What a Title, What a Record! Stay down with your bad selves, Pogues!!! Go Go Go!
B000M5AJQS|5.0|ladies and gentlemen, this movie was directed excellently. there are many layers to the story and its definitely something that'll keep you guessing. i definitely recommend it.
B000MTDRKE|4.0|First, let's get the obvious out of the way.  Neal Morse is an amazing musician and composer who constantly pushes himself with every release and this album is no exception.  For composition I give this 5 stars, for performance and sound I give this 5 stars, but lyrically...?  I just don't know.  I think I know what he wanted to say here, but I think what he ended up doing was unintentionally creating some real controversy by either injecting his own personal bias into the story of Martin Luther or by just not taking enough care with his lyrics to get his message across the way he intended.  I don't want to believe Neal Morse is either a racist or a demagogue out to denounce any faith or any brand of Christianity other than his own.  However, that certainly is a valid interpretation. <br /> <br />But it does feel like he has unwittingly undermined 2000 thousand years of the Catholic Church, all of its good works and contributions to our civilization.  Yes, it is true that during the time the album is set that many men in positions of power in the church were corrupt and used their influence for their own personal gain and not to advance the teachings of Christ.  But that does make the entire church corrupt or invalidate the good work of all the true believers even in Martin Luther's time?  The lyrics alone wouldn't prompt this question, however taken in context with Neal's brief but interesting essay it makes me wonder whom the real Neal Morse is.  These two texts together certainly hint at someone who is intolerant of every church but his own.  So I'm willing to give him the benefit of the doubt and assume that his message didn't come across as intended.   And for the record, I'm a lapsed Catholic who believes the world would be a better place without any church of any kind.  Too many wars, too much suffering caused by ALL religions. <br /> <br />On a positive note, the music is sheer brilliance.  The team of Morse, Portnoy and George has become my favorite new band.  If Testimony is his crowning glory, this one comes in at a close second.  Overall, highly recommended. <br />

0345455681|1.0|I evidently don't have the patience of the other readers who posted here.  I have rarely read anything so dull, with characters so wooden and impossible to be interested in.

Needless to say, I can't finish it--could hardly even begin it.  I'm giving up.
B00006RCOB|5.0|As a child, I was impressed by this movie's setting--the gritty, greasy depiction of the gritty, greasy life in the Soviet Union's proletariat interior--and the mesmerizing special effects that brought the MiG-31 to life.  As an adult, all of this came back to me, with the added awareness of setting, conflict, and dark penumbras.<br /><br />This is a dark film.  So many people die in this movie: the first contact Pavel Upenskoy, the Jew scientists, the Soviet Pilot of the second prototype.  Once again, setting is key:  this mission is dangerous, death is probable, and failure more than likely.  This contrasts with the gala James Bonds movies which (at times) can be life action cartoons, and is a precursor to the high-tension, high-body counts in \\"24.\\"<br /><br />The special effects, thought dated, still hold up. Though they are not as sophisticated 2005's film \\"Stealth\\" or the opening scenes of \\"Revenge of the Sith,\\" I could \\"piece out imperfections with my thoughts . . . And make imaginary puissance.\\"  I'm one of these people who still thrills when Buster Crabbe hops into his obviously model spaceship and blast off form Mongo.  Good storytelling can overcome bad special effects, as shown by \\"Ghostbusters.\\"<br /><br />Additionally, this film exemplifies how a book can be faithfully adapted to screen, without damaging the story or the theatrical presentation.  Of course, some of the credit goes to the way Craig Thomas wrote the book. It is minimalist character study of Mitchell Gant's psychodrama within the grim Soviet Union.  When Gant sweated, my palms became damp.<br /><br />Yes, this film is a bit long, but like in \\"2001,\\" I think the length added to the setting. The only thing that really could be cut is the bickering of the Soviet Air Marshals and the Premiere.  However, that would detract form the setting aspect of the story.  We see the hoary heads bang heads as they fumble with the hot potato that Gant has lobbed at them.  Picture a cross between the Sith Lords and the Three Stooges, and you capture the tragicomic aspect of this psychothriller.<br /><br />So, in the light of the Velvet Revolution, is this film relevant?  I think so.  In 1970, we had a double dose of military nostalgia--\\"Patton\\" and \\"MASH.\\"  In the midst of Vietnam, what did Korea or WWII have to do with anything?  In part, it has to do with the common elements of war, warfare, and the warriors.  C. S. Lewis spoke of a thought he had while in the service: \\"This is what Homer wrote about.  This is War.\\"<br /><br />Similarly, in order to defend life, liberty, and property, (the purpose of the military), we need to inculcate the warriors about the virtue and value of what they are doing.  Lewis again has important insight on this issue:<br /><br />\\"Those who say that children [or even grownups] must not be frightened may mean two things. They may mean (1) that we must not do anything likely to give the child those haunting, disabling, pathological fears against which ordinary courage is helpless: in fact, phobias. His mind must, if possible, be kept clear of things he can't bear to think of. Or they may mean (2) that we must try to keep out of his mind the knowledge that he is born into a world of death, violence, wounds, adventure, heroism and cowardice, good and evil.\\"<br /><br />\\"If they mean the first I agree with them: but not if they mean the second. The second would indeed be to give children a false impression and feed them on escapism in the bad sense. There is something ludicrous in the idea of so educating a generation which is born to the . . . atomic bomb. Since it is so likely that they will meet cruel enemies, let them at least have heard of brave knights and heroic courage. Otherwise you are making their destiny not brighter but darker.\\"<br /><br />Courage is one of the values that this film portrays, not just with accepting the mission, but most epically as Gant deals with his own personal ghosts of Vietnam.  In this sense, \\"Firefox\\" is about redemption:  Gant, unable to save one Vietnamese girl, is able to save millions of lives by stealing the Firefox and to restore a balance of power between the two nations.<br /><br />The other part has to do with aesthetics: this is a roping good spy and techno-thriller, and when we are done, we recognize that we have seen a marvelous tale told well.  And that is the hallmark of any good story.se, \\"Firefox\\" is about redemption:  Gant, unable to save one Vietnamese girl, is able to save millions of lives by stealing the Firefox and to restore a balance of power between the two nations. <br /> <br />The other part has to do with aesthetics: this is a roping good spy and techno-thriller, and when we are done, we recognize that we have seen a marvelous tale told well.

B00005JPLU|3.0|It doesn't take a history buff to tell you that '300' is not historically accurate. And it isn't meant to be. Based on a graphic novel, 300 is essentially the story of hundreds of Spartans standing up to thousands of Persian invaders. Vastly outnumbered, the Spartans make up for their disadvantage with their warrior mentality and skills. <br /> <br />Gerard Butler leads the cast as King Leonidas who must balance his love for his men with Spartan ideals of courage and freedom. (In fact, this movie is peppered with words of wisdom such as, \\"freedom isn't free!\\") His wife Queen Gorgo (Lena Heady) is as stoic as her husband. All actors, save one (played by Andrew Tiernan), have gorgeous faces and bodies. Butler and Heady are suitable in their roles, as is everyone. David Wenham narrates the piece as the tough Dilios; Vincent Regan plays Leonidas' right hand man; Michael Fassbender is the definition of a bloodthirsty Spartan, gung-ho about going to war. Tiernan plays a deformed hunchback and traitor when he is denied admittance to the Spartan army in a ridiculous subplot. Rodrigo Santoro plays King Xerxes. He is gorgeous, but bombastically (and intentionally) overblown. At first inspiring awe, his eight foot tall stature and deep voice over soon invoke laughter. <br /> <br />Dominic West, as the duplicitous \\"realist\\" Theron, is a standout. At first appearing rational in his reluctance to resist the Persians, it becomes evident that he is a snake. His was the most interesting character to me, as there is minimal character development. <br /> <br />Fight scenes are exciting, visuals are gorgeous, and dialogue is full of lame but arguable catchy one-liners. I expected to be offended by this film's simplistic portrayal of the enemy and war, but 300 does not take itself seriously. Like most movies, it gives almost nothing to think about. But it did give me the urge to shout, \\"SPARTA!\\"
B000929AJQ|5.0|Excellent Album.  More of the '80s NIN influence is obvious, along with some excellent evolutions.  I can't stop listening to it whenever I drive anywhere.  Great, polished album.  No tracks that are not worth hearing.
1881273156|3.0|Very similar to men are from mars and women are from venus.  This book is slow and I found the writing to be very elementary.
B0000062FJ|5.0|Hard-driving, original, and imaginative, the music on this album was way ahead of its time.  These songs are as easy-going and enjoyable as they are deep expressions of emotion.  You'll be glad you have this one.  The bonus tracks are Santana at Woodstock, including the previously unreleased \\"Fried Neckbones\\".
B000683VI4|5.0|On the surface, this is a smooth Romeo and Julietish styled story showcasing the dance of a romantic love that despite multitudinous strains and tests,  distills over time to something unearthly, uncanny, unnerving and fine. Behind the scenes however, touching nearly every conceivable level, is a production tour de force and synergy that stamps this movie as a timeless classic divining spiritual truths and one worthy of multiple viewings.
B000B8QF14|5.0|For someone who grew up with rock music, was a child in the 60s, a teen and young adult in the 70s, and witnessed the early stages of punk, also in the 70s, this album/DVD came as something of a revelation. Although I've been more or less out of the loop in terms of both rock and punk for some years, I thoroughly enjoyed listening to this disc--a \\"greatest hits\\" compilation leaning heavily on the \\"American Idiot\\" album--and watching the concert DVD. The songs belong to my daughter's generation, but geriatric as I am, I think the music is excellent, and the lyrics pretty intelligent, sometimes even searing. The DVD is fun to watch, too; the frenetic editing and choppy visuals don't really bother me.    I gather that some of the concert was cut from both disc and and film, but what is presented is very fine. The band, with two back up musicians, launch themselves into the American Idiot rock opera with a vengeance (complete with political commentary), and some older, vintage Green Day songs, like \\"Basket Case,\\" and the mega-hit \\"Good Riddance,\\" to the immense enthusiasm of the huge Brit crowd at the Milton Keynes National Bowl. Selections highlight the versatility of the group, which can belt out punk lyrics of anger and alienation, hard-hitting rock numbers, or melancholy ballads like \\"Wake Me Up When September Ends,\\" without missing a beat. All three musicians seem powered up and at the top of their game, and Billie Joe Armstrong, an energizer bunny if there ever was one, keeps the energy level high from start to finish with his remarkable voice (a flexible tenor with an occasional, pleasing quaver) and onstage antics.    To add to all of this, the members of Green Day--baby faced, green eyed Billie Joe, the lean, intense Mike Dirnt, affable Tre Cool with his inimitable clowning--have an undeniable visual appeal than comes across well in the concert DVD, as it has in their videos (viewable on the Green Day website).
B000683VI4|4.0|\\"The Notebook\\" (2004) has  absolutely amazing on-screen chemistry between two young lovers who are crazy about each other, whose love is so real, so overwhelming, so tender and passionate that you actually forget that they are acting. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are sensational. Since I saw Ryan in his controversial \\"The Believer\\" (2001), I always wait for his next film. I believe that he's got a great future. McAdams was radiant- just to think that the first movie I saw her in was Rob Schneider's \\"Hot Chick\\" (yes, I rented it). Her work in \\"The Notebook\\" made me think that for many young (and not so young) artists the biggest problem is not the lack of talent but the chance to find the right material and the right director who can make the best of their abilities.<br /><br />I love the movie. I believe it deserves its tears, every one of them. It really made me think of Woody Allen's words, \\"If you want to make God laugh, tell him about your plans\\". Even if the plans are as simple as to live happily ever after.
B000002BBY|5.0|After recently purchasing and loving Don't Believe the Truth, I dug into my old CD collection and dusted this one off.  I don't know what I can say that hasn't already been said about this album.  It is fantastic--honestly one of the best albums I have ever owned.  I am happy to be enjoying it yet again after not listening to it much for years.   <br /> <br />For some reason, Oasis have never been all that big in the U.S.  This album and their classic debut, Definitely Maybe, were overshadowed by the overblown and, thankfully, short-lived grunge trend of the early and mid-90s, and, frankly, their next three albums were not all that good.  So, Oasis never got the attention they deserved in the states.  However, Morning Glory is simply a classic album from top to bottom and is as enjoyable now as it was 10 years ago.  It is truly a definitive album that, in my opinion, should be in everyone's music collection.
0743496728|4.0|This was not as satisfying a read as I had hoped.  The topic was unfortunately all too familiar and while the various relationships were compellingly true, they could have been drawn with fewer lines and details. Nor was the \\"surprising twist\\" at the end all that surprising.  The pressure to fit in and the bullying that goes on in an effort to delineate social strata is significant and negatively impacts both the perpetrator and the victim.  It is difficult to believe that the blatant, long term  and focused violence described in this book would have been as broadly unnoticed or disregarded but maybe the author was making a point.  In spite of its flaws, it does challenge us to take a serious look at life through the lens of the other person and recognize that the honest choices we make as parents do not necessarily guarantee the outcome we envision.
B00001OH7N|5.0|In my mind, this is an album like no other. It's kind of like when you hear a Brain May solo and you immediately know who it is, even if you dont know the name of the song. For all of the loud, in your face guitar playing, the album as a whole sounds eerily distant. As far as music is concerned, this is about as strange as pop gets. Dig it.
B000M341QE|5.0|An excellent film, very well acted and directed and well worth watching more than once.
B000056N8X|5.0|I have seen this movie twice now, and I think the more I watch it, the more I will pick up on.  If you're a fan of the TV series, and the first 3 Highlander movies (other than 2 of course!) you're going to love this movie!

B00005JPG1|3.0|David Fincher's Zodiac is really two movies.  The first is an intriguing story about the search for a feared serial killer who enjoys taunting the police with letters to newspapers and making idle threats to school children.  The second is a paranoid rat race involving Robert Graysmith's (Jake Glyllenhaal) frantic and obsessive search for the identity of the Zodiac killer.  The first movie is great, the second movie is tedious.   <br /> <br /> Zodiac really starts off with a bang.  The opening scene shows two lovers cruising to a quiet spot while being followed by a mysterious car.  They pull up to a lovers lane area and the car that has been following them pulls up behind.  A man gets out with a flashlight attached to a gun and shots both of them.  The woman is killed, but the man survives.   <br /> <br />This scene sets the stage for the first half of Zodiac, which is filled with some brutal scenes of the killer taking his victims, the police frantically hunting the killer, and the members of the media trying to decipher the clues that the Zodiac sends them.  Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Anthony Edwards, and Glyllenhaal all put in some great performances.   <br /> <br />The frustration of the police and the reporters trying to capture Zodiac is palpable throughout the movie.  You feel bad for Detective Toschi (Ruffalo), and Paul Avary (Downey Jr.) because they want so badly to catch Zodiac, but he's always just out of reach.  There obsession to find Zodiac basically destroys the lives of everyone.  Toschi alienates his family and loses his job, Avary descends in to alcohol and drug addiction and loses his job, and Graysmith pushes his family away.  All of this is intriguing stuff.   <br /> <br />But then we get to the second half of the movie, which devolves from an interesting mystery to a mess of paranoid theories, red herrings, and tedious detective wankery.  The last hour or so of the movie is dedicated to Graysmith's personal obsession with Zodiac.  Graysmith hunts down every lead, no matter how far fetched, outlandish or crazy.  The audience is forced to sit and watch him search out every possible lead that he can, and it's kind of boring.  Every time Graysmith went after another lead, everyone in the theatre let out a groan, it was just too much.  It was overly complicated, and all of the names and facts were too hard to keep track off.  It felt like I needed a cliff notes version to read along with at the theatre.  There is nothing even close to a payoff.  I got the feeling that this movie could have gone on forever, with Graysmith chasing Zodiac until he died of old age on screen.   <br /> <br />I have a hard time recommending half of a good movie.  If you want to spend 10 bucks on half a good movie, then go right ahead.  You could probably walk out about half way through and not miss anything really important.  Not since JFK has a movie presented some many crazy theories about a subject and gone on for so long.     <br />
1582701709|3.0|I read a book that teaches this same message, but I read it back in the early 1980s.  The name of that book is \\"The Power of Your Subconscious Mind,\\" author Dr. Joseph Murphy.  It made a real difference in how I thought and helped me to change thought patterns that had either been fed me as a child or erroneously picked up along the way.   <br /> <br />It's no secret and hasn't been for a long time.  But I guess the title \\"The Secret\\" makes it more exciting and mysterious.  Go for it. <br />
B00005JPLU|3.0|300 is like that cute blonde girl who works at Abercombie and Fitch.  She's hot, she has a nice body, but she probably has nothing interesting to say beyond how much she likes shopping for new shoes.  She's beautiful but empty and devoid of any substance.  She may be interesting on a purely physical level, but nothing else about her is all that interesting.     <br /> <br />Frank Miller's work made me fall in love with comics when I was an adolescent.  The Dark Knight Returns, Ronin, his Daredevil work, and Sin City are all classics of the genre.  After the mishandling of the Elektra story in the Daredevil movie with corny acting and inaccurate characterization, Robert Rodriguez's Sin City showed great reverence and faithfulness to the original Sin City graphic novels, and low and behold, that was movie was great. <br /> <br />300 has a similar faithfulness to the source material that Sin City had.  Zach Snyder, the director of the surprisingly ok Dawn of the Dead remake, made an almost shot by shot remake of Miller's graphic novel, resulting in a visually appealing and exciting movie that is devoid of any real emotional substance or acting whatsoever, but hey, I wasn't really expecting any.   <br /> <br />300 tells the story of a small band of Spartan troops lead by King Leonidas (Gerard Butler) who manage to hold of a massive army of Persians before eventually succumbing to superior numbers but never surrendering  The story is loosely based on the Battle of Thermopylae, and I stress the term loosely.  If you're looking for historical accuracy, read an academic treatment of the subject.  There is also a subplot of political intrigue involving  Theron, (Dominic West) and Queen Gorgo, Leonidas's wife played by Lena Headly, though that's not really important. <br /> <br />What are important is the action sequences, which are simply gorgeous in a blood splattering, slow motion sort of way.  King Leonidas, and his band of shirtless macho dudes stave off hordes of prissyPersian's who dress in gaudy masks and costumes.  The action is the only reason to see this movie.  It's reminds of Kill Bill Vol. 1 because it's really nothing but an extended action sequence with some minor storyline elements thrown in.   <br /> <br />I enjoyed 300 on a purely visceral and violent level, but I have to comment on the lack of any real back story or strong acting.  All Gerard Butler is asked to do in this movie is scowl and yell out some macho phrases.  Dominic West, who some may know as Detective Jimmy McNulty from The Wire, is reduced to a mustache twirling caricature villain.  Those familiar with the subtly and complexity that he brings to McNulty will be disappointed with his flat characterization.  He was barely in the fourth season of The Wire, and I suspect that he was unavailable because he was making this movie.   <br /> <br />There are also some silly moments that made me laugh, even though I wasn't suppose to.  Are Spartan men never allowed to wear shirts, even when they are kids?,  Xerxes reminded me of Ru-Paul, and when Captain Artemis pours out his heart to Leonidas after his son is killed, I had to chuckle because the rest of the movie is so devoid of any emotion.  Plus there are some profoundly homoerotic themes.  I mean they are a bunch of buff dudes in leather bikini bottoms fighting in the hot gates.   <br /> <br />Anyway, I guess my complaints are fairly moot because no one goes in to this movie looking for great acting.  I know I didn't.  This movie ranks along side Kill Bill Vol. 1 and The Matrix Reloaded as great action pieces devoid of any real substance.  I would recommend this movie for a good time and a visual treat.  Try to see it on IMAX if you can, because all of the gory action and violence is larger than life on an IMAX screen.  <br />

B000MNP2KI|4.0|The DVD release of \\"Casino Royale\\" looks so good, Q must have personally supervised the transfer. Here's another case where MGM's home-video connection with Sony (and its A/V wizards) pays off big time. From the high-grain b&w intro to the scenes in the Bahamas and old Europe, the visuals are all stunning -- reference-quality work. The audio starts off strong but distinctly front-biased, but once the big footrace scene starts the 6-D soundstage roars into action.<br /><br />The extras don't follow the template MGM has been using for 007 titles (as on the \\"Ultimate Edition\\"box sets), so look for a collector's edition down the double-dip road. The main docu follows actor Daniel Craig as he becomes Bond -- including footage of the gloomy day when he first met the press -- shaken and stirred by his jet-ski ride across the Thames. Instead of a goofy life preserver, Craig says, he'll use water wings next time. The actor says he was prepared for Bond fan backlash, but when the Internet campaign against him kicked in, \\"It did shake me up.\\" (Apparently the fanboys hadn't checked out the excellent \\"Layer Cake.\\")<br /><br />The second docu is the usual stunt-work chronicle. The third rounds up most of the Bond girls. There's also a lame music video, one of those where the singer wanders around in the movie like he belongs there.<br /><br />The movie comes nicely letterboxed (a cinematic 2.40:1), but there's also a full-screenversion for those who must. Q must have been fresh out of DTS audio, unfortunately. The Blu-ray version no doubt sparkles.<br /><br />Put this title straight onto the year's top 10 list. Well done, indeed.
B000003TA9|4.0|Each Sonic Youth album has a very unique flavor, and each Sonic Youth album stands out in their extremely lengthy catalouge... yet it is hard to find a Sonic Youth album that is virtually flawless. Obviously, Sonic Youth are not at all interested with perfection, rather atmosphere... but isn't that what makes this band so great?<br /><br />There seems to be two basic problems with Sonic Youth releases. On some, the production is way too obscure and lacking to let the beauty of the album be heard, and on others, the soaring sections of feedback and reverb can sometimes wander off into obscure directions with seemingly no purpose. Both are aspects that I do not criticize too harshly, because I think of Sonic Youth as artists rather than musicians, throwing the ugly in with the beautiful to create a very realistic picture. Reguardless, these flaws do bring down the overall release somewhat.<br /><br />In 'Dirty', there are no throw out tracks, great (but not too great wich is a good thing) production, and the feedback sessions are shortened and too the point. This is a very straightforward release by Sonic Youth standards, but also a very dark and atmospheric work at the same time. Everything seems in place here, a classic SY release. The only complaint I have is that in some places, 'Dirty' may be a little too straightforward. Not quite a masterpiece such as 'Daydream Nation' or 'A Thousand Leaves', but a very solid, and entertaining album as a whole.

B000LC4CVA|3.0|I enjoyed the first DVD so much, I was really looking forward to this one. I was very disappointed. The women are beautiful and their voices as melodic as ever. The sound balance was not at all good and the producer had them doing some strange coreography that was awkward.
B0007VZ9DK|5.0|Italian-American film director Martin Scorsese presents his audience with perhaps his most brutal and telling tale of mobster confab. What is often described as a long-awaited sequel to Goodfellas, CASINO rolls in as perhaps his greatest achievement. A story of love, lust, jealousy, luck, power and control.. all the basic elements of the tragic rise-and-fall existence of Mafia brutes. Robert De Niro gives his ultimance performance as Sam \\"Ace\\" Rothstein, a high-stakes gambler with mob connections who aspires to the throne of Las Vegas' most glamourous and respected businessman. After a long life of rackets, he finally seeks salvation in The Tangiers Hotel and Casino where he is heralded as king. He is about to achieve his life-long goal of fame, fortune and family until boyhood friend and mobster Nicky Santoro (played to stellar effect by fast-talking Joe Pesci) and beloved wife Ginger McKenna (Sharon Stone) create havoc and begin making headlines. Now, Rothstein must risk his own dignity to placate his family ties and continue forward. Eventually, he finds his empire collapsing under a steady stream of drugs, violence and infidelity. After years of self-destructive behavior, Nicky and Ginger pay the ultimate price, while Rothstein is reduced to a self-loathing individual who had everything to gain only to lose it all with a throw of the dice. A tragic and unbelievably true story of fame, power and riches and the sacrifices that are inherent to it. A MUST-BUY!!!!!

B000ICL3KG|4.0|Well made, but - the key argument presented here doesn't fit the data. Gore shows graphs of CO2 and temperature, and claims that the relationship between CO2 and warming, as shown from the ice cores, is \\"complicated.\\" What he doesn't tell you is that the data shows the opposite of what he claims - CO2 levels *lag* global temperatures by about 800 years. So ... warming is not caused by CO2!<br /><br />Also, temps in the past have been much higher - for example, the Medieval Warm Period. And they were periods of great production and wealth.<br /><br />See the video at google video, \\"The Great Global Warming Swindle\\".<br /><br />UPDATE: Greenpeace founder Patrick Moore says it's all BS.<br /><br />UPDATE: 2007 temperature drop of 0.7 degrees \\"wiped out\\" all recent years' global warming \\"gains.\\" Some scientists now warn of global cooling.<br /><br />UPDATE: in light of record temp drops and snowfalls, preferred term is now \\"climate change.\\"
B000784WMW|5.0|I didn't think I was going to like this one. My favorite has always been until now, the version with George C Scott. Timothy Dalton does a fabulous job in bringing such passion to Rochester. Absolutely floored. Their playfulness was totally missed in the other versions. I will watch this again and again.
B00005JKEZ|5.0|This is in my opinion one of the finest adventure/romance films ever done. The story's great and the pace is perfect.From a sneering Basil Rathbone to the innocent Olivia deHavilland to the dashing Errol Flynn and all the great character actors, there isn't an off note in the symphony. The action is breathtaking and includes the best sword fight ever filmed. This is a movie you'll watch over and over again -- I know I do.
1932907009|5.0|I'm 27. When I was 24 I decided I wanted to write a screenplay. I talked about it for a couple years, but could never really get started. Then a friend recommended Blake's book to me. I bought it and two months later my first screenplay was finished. I'm not saying that you buy this book, read it, and 60 some odd days later you have a movie. See, I had pretty much all the ideas for scenes either in my head or in my journal. Kind of like hundreds of tiny puzzle pieces scattered about. Blake's book helped me lay out the structure of my story before I started typing. Once I had that down, all the pieces just seemed to fall into place when I finally did start typing.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|Neil Young's Live at Massey Hall  is an instant classic, and the best live album of his long career-easily surpassing 1979's Live Rust.  With the entire place at his command-early on he informs what is essentially a hometown crowd that he will be playing mostly new music(to applause!)-Young runs through some the most affecting songs he'd written to that point; indeed , several from Harvest wouldn't be released for over a year, including an embryonic piano version of Heart of Gold as part of a medley with A Man Needs a Maid. Looking at it from our vantage point 36(!) years on, Live at Massey Hall seems like a \\"greatest hits live\\" collection, putting us in the position of observing the 1971 crowd hearing music for the very first time that we already know is classic Neil Young. What I'm trying to say  is that not only does the audience appreciate the new songs, they enthusiastically applaud songs-such as Cowgirl in the Sand, Helpless, and the songs from the (then current) After the Goldrush that were relatively new at that time as though they were already part of the classic rock canon. Which, I suppose they were. Live at Massey Hall, 1971 can be enjoyed on so many levels.  Long time die hard fans, Harvest-era casual fans, and younger fans seeking a quick introduction to the genius of Neil Young can all benefit from this excellent collection.
B000LXH0AE|4.0|Stranger Than Fiction has an interesting premise; that some of us are only characters in a book being written by a writer who has no idea that we are real.  However instead of taking this for a dark spin (like \\"Secret Window\\" or \\"The Dark Half\\") director Marc Forster spins it into a drama with comic overtones. <br /> <br />His cast is up to the challenge.  Will Farrell plays the likable but kinda clueless Harold Crick.  Its an everyman role, but Farrell adds subtle nuances that make the character real.  Maggie Gyllenhaal is excellent as the spunky Ana Pascal.  Her chemistry with Farrell makes their romantic entanglements believable.  Emma Thompson as the writer Karen Eiffel, does an impeccable job of playing the eccentric and tortured artist.  Of course the film has plenty of great supporting actors like Dustin Hoffman, Queen Latifah, Tom Hulce, Linda Hunt, and Tony Hale in a great part as Harold's nerdy friend Dave. <br /> <br />The script is well written and thought out.  The direction works very well.  Pacing was a little slow, but I think I was deceived by the commercials that give the impression that this is a hilarious comedy.  Parts of it are funny, but the movie is more of a drama, and Farrell's acting skills suit both parts well.  The score and soundtrack are also memorable and fit the movie like a glove. <br /> <br />All in all, I was completely entertained by the movie.  It proves that Farrell can jump into more dramatic roles (if he cares to).  For those looking for a solid nights entertainment with a great cast and a unique script, here is the movie to watch.
B0000C3I6U|4.0|The DVD was great.  <br />The extras are what make theis worth having.  <br />the original movie is dated and you can tell it is old, but heck it's a clasic.  The extras are what makes this copy of the movie great all the \\"making of\\" and extra interviews are great.  <br />
B000JK8OYU|4.0|I heard the mixed Lady Madonna on the radio first, and wondered, what the heck...Then I heard the whole thing on Public Radio.  I went out and bought it and listened to it while sitting around with my sister.  Both of us saw the Beatles on Ed Sullivan and are staunch fans and we loved the amount of songage available.  I also read Geoff Emerick's book Here, There, and Everywhere - on his part as the Beatles' engineer.  It all came together, somehow.  From John Lennon's mumbled 'sugar plum fairy' before a Day in the Life, to remembering Emerick's stories regarding what happened during a recording session.  This CD isn't perfect, by any means - some of the in-between mixes are just muddles of memories.  But most of the mixes range from brilliant, in some instances, to just plain impish in others.  And you know, it makes me happy just to hear it.  Man, I miss these guys.  And Man, they was fab.
B00005R8FI|5.0|Over the years i have left some great and classic LPS at 'close friends' homes. My friend Gloria was the earth mother for our 'band of gypsys'. Her apartment was the place to party and crash, and above all listen to those forbidden albums you could never hear at home. This and Aqualung, plus all the Moody Blues, released at that time, were played alot. Gloria was a Janis Joplin Fanatic. There was some great times and smoke had by all when the stereo was cranked up. From start to finish this was a great album, and from this we moved on to Mark-Almond's first LP. John Mayall talking about <br />chiky-chiky what had us laughing and the mouth percussion put us over the  <br />top. But as much as i loved this Album back then, hearing it alone is not the same. Invite some friends over each of you play what you like and include this one, too. Fans of the newest tween-age hotty will not be impressed-the more fool them. Fans of the Blues, and those who did not know they were, caught on to John Mayall and never left him behind. Catch <br />him here and all that he has done. This would be a good start. I left this behind and it was my loss and her gain. The CD is in the mail for me as we speak.
1400082773|5.0|I think this book illustrates clearly why a man with this kind of background and this rich learning experience could be a very promising new leader for the free world.  I'd like to see everyone read this book, both for sheer pleasure and for insight into the character a potential President should have.  This world is now such a mess that we need a very remarkable man to lead the United States, and someone who has had experience with people who have broader views than just Texans.
0786939532|5.0|This was an excellent book. While it is not an overly complex read, and I had worried that the book may be a bit simplistic and aimed solely at a younger audience, as I read the book I found my concerns more than met.  <br /> <br />I started this book around 2:30 in the morning when I couldn't sleep, intending to read it for 30 minutes, however, the book's story was so engrossing that I ended up finishing the entire book (at 7 am) and heading to buy the next in the series at the local bookstore the next day, which I also read cover-to-cover. <br /> <br />A fascinating series that is highly enjoyable, though a leach on one's time. Highly recommended.
B000005YZM|5.0|poor sales of this album when it was first released, so i have heard, contributed to the demise of this wonderful band. too bad. time; however, did prevail. \\"time of the season,\\" became a huge hit, as well it should have, sporting one of the most haunting sounds of any pop song from the late 60's. the mellotron, played by rod argent(later leader of the group argent: remember \\"hold your head up?\\") has a heavy presence on this album, which is lit up by a whole color of sounds. heavenly pop hooks, harmonies, and divine vocals florish on this recording. colin blunstone, the singer, has a mesmerizing voice (if you are a nick drake fan, it seems obvious that drake was heavily influenced by blunstone's voice and phrasing), and this set of tunes was as good a showcase as he ever got to let that voice shine. in 1971 blunstone released an outstanding solo record called \\"one year,\\" which i also highly, highly recommend. anyway, \\"odessey & oracle\\" is a cornerstone to any 60's psychedelia music collection, and one of the best pop/rock ablums of the late 60's. a must have for your music collection.
0671015206|5.0|Stanley & Danko have done for Money what Kinsey did for Sex - They have taken us inside the lives of the wealthy and non-wealthy alike and exposed the hidden behaviours of each group.  In the process many myths are put to rest.  The great thing about this book is that it is based upon surveys and collected facts - not just upon anecdotes or hearsay.  The first third of the book is universal wisdom - as good as anything you will find on any self-help bookshelf anywhere.  Word for word this has a lot of insight in it.  Beyond this the book starts to dig into the survey results in more depth.  Despite being written over ten years ago the book is a valid today as it was when first released. <br /> <br />The book addresses spending and investing habits, the issues that millionaires might worry about compared with others, the factors that millionaires themselves have identified as their keys to success.  A wide range of issues such as: spouse, education, ancestry, choice of house, choice of car, choice of job, are all discussed.  Even if you have no desire to accumulate wealth - this book would still be fascinating. <br /> <br />Overall this is great reading - I wish I had read it years ago.  For those interested - I also own The Millionaire Mind - the follow-up book by the same author.  Having gone through both - I'd recommend reading this one first.  Although it is older - it is more concise and I found it a more valuable read. The Millionaire Mind then follows up with more detailed analysis based upon survey results.   <br />
0974872407|5.0|Uno de los mejores libros de ficcion que he leido en mi vida. Es emocionante la manera como este libro envuelve a los personajes y el hilo de la narracion se complica mas y mas, mientras en cada capitulo se revelan pequenas pistas del desenlace que no son entendidas sino al final.<br /><br />Las revelaciones en torno al destino de los personajes lo sacude a uno como lector. El estilo unico de Ruiz Zafon para narrar historias y crear situaciones de peligro e intriga, hara que este libro permanezca en las librerias por largo tiempo. Es una lastima que el libro no haya tenido el gran despliegue de publicidad que otros autores mediocres logran. Tomara tiempo para que este autor sea reconocido en las artes gracias a este prodigioso trabajo.<br /><br />Sientese en una comoda silla, sirvase un trago o mejor traigase la botella y preparese para leer sin detenerse esta historia de amor, pasion y odio, de principio a fin.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|When I was 16 I bought a bootleg, Neil Young, Live on Sugar Mountain, record on the '71 tour.  The year, 1972.  I still have that LP, enjoyed it all my life,  and love it to this day.  So when I saw this recording being released today I knew I had to buy it. With great anticipation I brought home the CD/DVD.  I have to tell you I watched the DVD first and it totally exceeded my expectations.   It was like my long loved bootleg came to life in a way I could never know.  I'm a big Neil Young fan and can tell you this is special.  All the great songs are here, Old Man, Tell Me Why, Needle and the Damage Done, performed by a young Neil in his prime.  You will never regret buying this.  Get the DVD/CD, it's worth it.  Enjoy
B000N6U0E2|5.0|This movie has become an instant classic in my favorite movie collection. I cannot wait for it to come out on DVD. Well, I liked it so much, I went to see it twice already. Do I need to say more? <br />

0375703764|4.0|A great read that blends post-modern lit crit forays with some genuinely frightening horror elements. While it probably wont make you question your worldview to the extent Johnny Truant pushes it in the text, it's still a fairly trippy ride. Danielewski plays with the typography in fun ways that stop just short of being overdone and experiments with narrating several perspectives at once, which works well but can make wading through some sections a chore. <br /> <br />Overall, an enjoyable and exceptional first novel.
B000KF0NHU|5.0|This is an excellant HD DVD for clarity, vivid colors, and surround sound affects. The family loved the movie and considers it to be in the top tier of animated family movies.
B000J103PC|5.0|Not really a \\"chick flick\\", more like Wall Street with women and more jokes. Lots of folks, including me, don't seem to like the ending, but hey, chill (as used to say when I was ten years younger.......)
6305428352|5.0|Mr. HOLLAND'S OPUS is a great example of when films, centered on music and the celebration of artistic self expression, go great.  Glenn Holland (Richard Dreyfuss) is a young high school music teacher and aspiring composer, whose goal is to compose an original musical piece.  He must take on a more stable teaching job, to support himself and his pregnant wife Iris (Glenne Headly).  The film follows him from his humble beginnings, as a musical teacher, guiding a group of naturally gifted, disabled and difficult students.  Holland transforms these young people and encourages them to pursue their budding ablities as musicians.  I don't want to reveal too many plot points because I don't want to ruin the movie for you.<br /><br />What works so well is the combination of great direction by Stephen Herek, wonderful acting and a great musical score by Michael Kamen.  Richard Dreyfuss earned a well-deserved Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his role as Glenn Holland.  This film takes a great look at life, love and the music that exists in everyone's hearts. Just beautiful and inspiring......
1401302378|2.0|First of all, let me say that this book is no worse than 80% of the other business books sitting on the shelf.  But if you are crunched for time, want to learn something, and want to get some ideas that will help you, look elsewhere. <br /> <br />The basic premise has been explained in other reviews.  It comes from the insight that everything in the ITunes catalog sells at least once every month.  In other words, however much you can make available (which in a digital space is almost infinite), you will sell some of it.   <br /> <br />That is a great and interesting idea.  It would be great for an article, but not for a book.  The book just becomes a run on of that idea.  Furthermore, if you work in packaged goods, retail, or any other business outside of a digital universe (i.e. where you don't have infinite space) this idea does little to help you.   <br /> <br />The \\"future\\" of online business may be selling less to more, but until they build a Wal-Mart the size of Texas, everybody else will be left looking for mass appeal.
B00005JPLU|3.0|Good movie. Entertaining. Graphically excellent. Much much better than both the Alexander and Troy movies (1 stars movies) - but definitely inferior to Gladiator(4.5 stars to me).<br /><br />BUT.<br />Although this is a Hollywood production and not that of the History channel:<br /><br />1) Persians look like deformed monsters and very unsophisticated. This is insulting to their civilization that had achieved a lot by 480BC.<br /><br />2) The Greeks fight like barbarians - only twice do they fight in phalanx formation - the rest of the time they fight as mad barbarians more appropriately resembling battles of the dark ages.<br /><br />3) When out routed - the Spartans seem to want to stay to defend the pass - just because they desperately want a \\"beautiful death\\" - very little hinted on the idea that they stayed to cover the retreat of their fellow allies.<br /><br />4) There is no Athenian figure at all through out the movie. It is made to look as if Athens was minimally involved. They were in fact flanking the Spartans with their fleet.<br /><br />5) I'm half Greek and the history of the Persian Wars is very dear to me as to all Greeks. However, I did not feel emotional at the death of the Spartans in the movie - something that instead I did feel reading the book by Steven Pressfield \\"Gates of Fire\\".<br /><br />Nevertheless, it is a good movie and entertaining which should inspire people to read about the history and how the Persian Wars were key to the outcome of Western civilization.
B00005ASHM|2.0|First, I love the Beach Boys. I think they have some great stuff.  I also love the Beatles, Rolling Stones, Led Zeplin, old blues, Black Sabbath, and new rock, etc.  I am very open minded when it comes to music.  I love classical, jazz, opera, every genre.  But I apparently have some deficiency when it comes to this album. Although there are a few great songs, I find the album mostly aweful and unlistenable.   It is beyond me how some have put this as the greatest rock album of all time.  Maybe one day I will wake up and see what I'm missing, but I doubt it.
0679422714|5.0|Jung Chang and Jon Hallidady present a riveting portrait of evil.  They describe how one man created hell for himself, his wives and children, his close associates - and for a quarter of the human beings on the planet.  *Mao, The Unknown Story,* reads like a novel, but it is a well document biography.  Still, even if only a fraction is true, then we in the West have reason for shame because of our complicity.  What should disturb us most is the book's epilogue: <br /> <br />Today Mao's portrait and his corpse still dominate Tiananmen Square in the heart of the Chinese capital.  The current Communist regime declares itself to be Mao's heir and fiercely perpetuates the myth of Mao.
B000LPS47U|5.0|I compared the special features in this release with the one released by Elite (millennium edition).  Most of them are the same.  The only real notable difference is that this one has a new 70 minute documentary.  I'm sure that's worth the effort of rebuying another 2-disc set.  If you have the Elite version, you may want to pass on this.
0380789035|5.0|This is one of the most inventive, creative, amusing and engaging novels I've read in a while. There are tons of reviews here, so I won't summarize the plot. I will, however, take issue with the rather snarky reviewer from Publishers Weekly, who said, \\"The intriguing premise of Gaiman's tale is that the gods of European yore, who came to North America with their immigrant believers, are squaring off for a rumble with new indigenous deities...\\" and then went on to be little impressed by the novel.<br /><br />I'm taking issue on the premise that this is about gods of European yore who came to America. The premise really is that ALL the many varied immigrants to America brought their gods with them. Not just Europeans. There are well-developed storylines of African, Egyptian and Mesopotamian gods here. One of the most moving of the short vignettes is about an African brother and sister that are enslaved, separated, and meet their unfortunate fates in America. I loved that. Gaiman has humanized the American experience with wide arms. That reviewer from Publishers Weekly was half dozing when he/she read the book, and it shows in the review.<br /><br />This was a great book. Gaiman - British though he is - knows a lot more about what makes America tick then most US writers. He's critical of the country while not being condescending. He's insightful, while still showing that he loves this place. I think that's grand.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Casino Royale hasn't got it. No silly villains, no stupid plot, or silliness that makes you cringe. No sappy dialogue, or poor fight scenes. No more Bond that girls have to drag guys to see.  <br /> <br />Forget those other guys. Daniel Craig IS James Bond. He's the guy Ian Fleming had in mind when he conceived the character. Craig is not pretty boy cute, and doesn't act like he's in a comedy. Craig takes control of Bond, and makes him HIS Bond. I pity anyone that assumes the character when Daniel Craig is done with him.  <br /> <br />The movie is well written and suspenseful. You won't want to hit pause before it's over. There's simply no slow parts good for breaks. The action is first rate. Of course there are women!

When I had purchased the book I did not know that I would need to take the \\"survey\\" for my class.  The book I had purchased had a code to input when going online to take the survey.

B0000062Y2|5.0|This CD is outstanding.  I have seen the movie, the play and totally enjoy the soundtrack.  It's music that you really \\"feel\\".  Truly, Andrew Lloyd Webber at one of his best!!
B00005JPLW|1.0|Thanks for this heads-up. I don't hold out much hope for these Hollywood fake historical dramas. They are just pumped up good guy-bad guy Axis-of-Evil propaganda imposed on ancient history, which is completely ridiculous. The last decent Greek epic Hollywood ever made was \\"Clash of the Titans\\" back around 1980. I just stopped paying attention to all the hype.
B000002U82|5.0|THE BAND: Roger Waters (bass, vocals, tape effects), David Gilmour (guitar, vocals), Richard Wright (keyboards), Nick Mason (drums & percussion, tape effects).<br /><br />THE DISC: (1973) Nine songs clocking in at approximately 42 minutes. Included with the disc is a 22-page booklet containing all original album artwork, song titles/credits, song lyrics, band photos and thank you's. Recorded at Abbey Road Studios in London. Sound engineer - a very young Alan Parsons. Digitally remastered in 1993 as well as 2003 (20th & 30th anniversary issues). All music written by Pink Floyd members; all lyrics by Roger Waters. Label - Capital Records.<br /><br />COMMENTS: 1973 was a standout year for rock albums... to name a few - Led Zeppelin's \\"Houses Of The Holy\\", Paul McCartney's \\"Band On The Run\\", The Who's \\"Quadrophenia\\", the Rolling Stone's \\"Goats Head Soup\\", Aerosmith's debut, and Elton John's \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\". However one album released in the same year rises above the rest... Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\". A true classic... filled with rock, blues and sound effects. \\"Dark Side\\" is a concept album of sorts dealing with man's life experiences - birth, time, greed, travel, mental illness, and death. Facts: 40+ million copies sold globally. \\"Dark Side\\" featured 3 Billboard hits with \\"Money\\" (#13 - the band's first top 20 hit), \\"Time\\" and \\"Us And Them\\"... the album stayed on Billboard's 'Top 200' list for 741 weeks (14+ years) - a record that may never be broken. Alan Parsons' sound expertise reached well beyond his years and you'll find that the listen is clean, crisp and deep to a fault. As for the songs, they still sound great decades later. From the opening intro of \\"Speak To Me\\" leading into the dreamy \\"Breathe\\"; to the synthesizer instrumental \\"On The Run\\"; to the alarm clocks and catchy beat of \\"Time\\"; to the piano intro and timeless singing of Clare Torry on \\"The Great Gig In The Sky\\"; to the longest song on the album (7+ minutes) and perhaps most recognized song in their entire catalog \\"Money\\" (complete with cash register rings); to the bluesy \\"Us And Them\\" with Dick Parry's gorgeous saxophone layered from start to finish; to Gilmour's progressive instrumental jam \\"Any Colour You Like\\" featuring a great guitar solo and some incredible keyboards from Wright; to the climatic grand finale of \\"Brain Damage\\" and \\"Eclipse\\". As good as Waters and Gilmour were together, it strikes me odd that they didn't collaborate on more songs here. Only 3 of the 9 tracks here have both their names on the credits. This also became true on future albums from Pink Floyd... making me think that there was a distance between them. Great song writing teams (like Paul McCartney & John Lennon, Mick Jagger & Keith Richards, etc) are hard to find and keep together. No exception here, but the music is what counts. Start your Pink Floyd collection with \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\", followed by \\"Wish You Were Here\\", \\"The Wall\\" and \\"Animals\\". When you are considering the great ALL-TIME classic rock albums... several come to mind... Led Zeppelin \\"4\\", Beatles \\"Sgt Pepper\\" or \\"Abbey Road\\", The Who \\"Who's Next\\", Deep Purple \\"Machine Head\\", AC/DC \\"Back In Black\\", Boston and Van Halen debuts, and absolutely Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\".

B000ICL3KG|5.0|I cant understand why anyone wouldnt say this movie is important. But then again I dont understand why anyone would say that global warming isnt real without being paid to do so.  <br /> <br />I could have done without the scenes on Al Gore's personal life, eventhough they fit into the movie decently. And Al Gore's not normally a person I want to look at for an hour and a half but he is very likable and sorta charming in this movie. But really this is all beside the point, what matters is the content which everyone needs to know. <br /> <br />See this movie and take action.
B000002JKS|2.0|This, Plants third solo album, is a real departure for him. His first two solo slabs were works of brilliance, no doubt about it. But if anything that only raised the bar for his future releases.<br /><br />And this collection of what can only be loosely termed songs is a total departure from Plants first two solo outings. Those albums were fully of perfectly crafted rock 'n' roll songs that had quite traditional structures. Here all bets are off in an almost cheeky fashion, playful collections of sounds sprinkled into the listeners ear. There are still guitar riffs here, still Plants easily recognisable vocal stylings and beautiful touches, the opening to Trouble your Money being particularly reminiscent of earlier triumphs.<br /><br />But none of the cute playing, simple and gentle production or the good vibes carried over from his first two albums can save this from being anything but nonsense. Art pop, if you will. In fact it's art pop even if you won't. A series of noises strung out until the approximate length of a song is reached, none of the tracks here being necessary to your life and few having any real reason to be, a bunch of weird time signatures, disjointed instrumentation and gimmick joke fills by many and varied instruments all put together to disguise the fact that nobody here has much to say. Only the human feel of earlier Plant albums helps hold this lot together, something which can't be said for the next album, Now and Zen. Though with that album the tunes are a heck of a lot stronger.<br /><br />I've really enjoyed Plants solo career, but this is for completists only as it's so radically different to his other stuff. The 'lost' Plant album, so to speak. You've been warned.
B000LPS3B2|4.0|The movie is not anything new considering the uprising of foreign ghost movies usually featuring a pale, thin girl with long dark hair that falls in her face and moves rather quickly.  But the movie is very well done with good acting and nice pacing.  I found myself at some points cheering for the ghost.  The ending was very fitting and ironic.
B000006OBQ|5.0|Excellent choice.  It is very gratifying to be able to still locate these concerts from the past and just to be able to dial them up on the iPod at the gym or walking or anywhere you can plug in an iPod.
B000K7VHJQ|5.0|Although I have seen this movie in the theatre, the added directors cut and the making of the film were extremely informative. It shows how Mel Gibson made this movie and the supporting cast he had which made this movie so great.
B00006AVRK|5.0|No one has been able to bring to life the characters of Jeeves and Wooster, two of the wonderful creations of the fertile imagination of P.G. Wodehouse, as have Fry and Laurie in this wonderful series. I have been reading the Wodehouse stories for fifty years and they continue to delight me to this day. Earlier attempts to portray these characters have fallen far short of conveying the unique nature of this comedy. I only wish more episodes had been filmed before the series ended. These are works of genius!
0739462458|5.0|\\"The Wallflower\\" Series by Lisa Kleypas includes 4 novels.  All four were very enjoyable.  I couldn't pick a favorite.  They were all books that you just didn't want to put down.  I highly recommend them and think that they are four of her best books.

B0001US8FI|5.0|This is Bruce Lee at his best, he really shows how fast(scary fast)he is<br />The only sad thing about this movie is you can see(WELL DIE HARD LEE FANS ANYWAY) that the man was slowly dying. Bruce looks thin(still muscular<br />though) but very thin if you compare him to his other films,he had already<br />had a fainting spell prior or during filming of this masterpiece and sadly<br />it was just a matter of time. Still if he was not the man he was by not<br />relaxing and shutting his engine off so to speak we really would not be<br />celebrating him today,no by him pushing himself beyond the limits he has<br />shown the world that when you have speed,technique,skill and power,you<br />really can beat any man one on one.
B000JK8OYU|5.0|\\"Love\\", the newly released Beatles' album is a metamorphosis of the Beatles' treasured and familiar sounds into an exciting living experience. A Beatles enthusiast listens on tender hooks, constantly anticipating being swept in a different direction or being immersed in new but strangely recognizable layers.  Sir George and Giles Martin, George's son, blend and mix original Beatles' recording material with meticulous care. The project has been executed with the brilliance one would expect from this talented family.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|I confess I have not yet played the audio dvd, but I love the cd. When I first listened I listend hard, to find what I could of the differences. Now I just rock to the great music!
B0007Y89ZM|5.0|I'll keep it brief as the benefits of this now classic performance have been well stated in other reviews. All I can say is if you like the Eagles music you'll love this dvd. And.. if you have a decent audio set up, it'll blow your mind! Beware the 'Farewell Tour' dvd new release. It's not bad but you WILL be dissapointed by the sound especially and the performances after the 'Freezes Over' experience.
B000MGUZMU|5.0|This is album is outstanding, I don't know what all of you are talking about with the lack of raw energy because to be quite honest I feel energy streaming out of my speakers whenever I listen to this. Sure it's not as edgy as Funeral was, but the emotion that the tracks evoke is irreplaceable. The Arcade Fire established themselves with Funeral, now they can develop their sound and convey the message they want to convey. As a musician myself I know that it's a much bigger compliment to have someone say your music moved them than it is to say you rock.
B0002KQNJU|5.0|This tongue in cheek horror spoof is wonderfully distracting  (Sharon Tate comes to mind here- .WoW.stunning.It is also hilarous throughout. The film is very atmospheric and the set designs (castle roof top scenes and the castle itself for example- though there are many!) are just wonderful and very convincing. Not to mention the beautiful soundtrack which will remain with you long after the movie ends. Comes highly recommended!
B000F0UUIM|5.0|I love to watch a good John Wayne western any time but the Searcher's is his best.  In fact I consider it one of the best westerns ever made by Hollywood.  In addition to John Wayne and Natalie Wood in it, it is loaded with some of the best supporting actors/actresses at that time.  I remember seeing it in theatres and the small TV screen does not do it justice.  Now with the new widescreen big TV's the grandeur of it and the wonderful story can be enjoyed like it was intended to be seen.  I must have watched this movie dozens of time over the years and never tire of watching it again.  The extras with the 50th anniversay edition just make it that much more enjoyable.  I am glad that so far no one has been arrogant enough in Hollywood to do a remake of this.  There will never be another like John Wayne with his screen presence.  Today's actors pale in comparison to him.
B000JJS8TM|5.0|Good song selection tastefully mixed. It's a bit of a novelty but stands up to repeated listenings. I won't harbour on suffice to say that if you are a Beatles fan and you have a decent audio set up you'll be taken a back by the soundstage created here (DTS is FAB!)I would love to hear the Beatles catalog given the royal treatment with remastering sooner than anymore of this type of thing. One thing that this product does is give you an idea of just how good the Beatles back catalog would sound remastered. Come on EMI CAPITOL!!
B0000C0FJB|4.0|Basically I've taken to leaving Disc 3 filed at home while Discs 1 and 2 are in the car stereo rotation. And there's an eight-minute drum solo that's pretty much unnecessary. There's also one notable missing song: \\"Subdivisions.\\" Strange that Rush would do a live album or compilation without that one.
B00003CXZ4|4.0|The more I watch this movie the better it gets. The first time ,I couldn't understand it( 2 1/2 stars) . The second time, I only watched half, that's because I had to do something (3 stars).  The third time I completely watched it and understood more of it,I think!(4 stars) I'm looking forward to watching this movie tonight for the fourth time, I never saw a movie from back to front, the movie is told in reverse first.  You have to watch it many times to really understand it( at least you think you understand it). Every time I watch this movie the stars go up...after tonight it probably get 5 stars. After 5 stars there's only one direction that's down . I'm stopping when it gets to five stars! Be prepared to watch this movie every night the first week you get it or watch it till you have to return it to the video store. This will be on my to buy list.

B0006GQMC8|5.0|There are two movies that come to mind, when I speak of this one,\\"Lonely are the Brave\\" and \\"Valdez is Coming\\". The same theme in all three of these excellent films, \\"the Law Hunts The Fugitive\\" The fugitive portrays the sympathytic hero in all three films. In all three, the persuer takes a liking to the one he hunts. They come to respect his courage and fortitude. This movie is full of twists, turns, thrills and spills, excitement, suspense, not to mention beautiful mountain scenery. Last but definetly not least, Lee Marvin and Charles Bronon, they alone are worth the price of admission. \\"Anonymously\\" Louie G.

076790382X|5.0|A short and sweet review!  This book is a great read.  I appreciate the author's sense of humor and variety of topics.  His essay/graduation address should be read by all graduating high school students and read again when they graduate college!  His basic advice centers on the idea that--you're special--but not that special--learn to have some care for other people.  This was my introduction to Bill Bryson and I have since read some of <br />his other books and hope to read more.
B000AYEIZY|5.0|This CD is unbelievable. These guys were beyond awesome in concert. The quality of this recording is superb. Jack Bruce singing \\"We're going wrong\\" is the most wonderful song on the CD. I was in N.Y. to see them live last year and could not believe the power this group of guys have. You must buy the DVD of their London appearence. Watch Jack Bruce sing \\"we'er going wrong\\" and enjoy one of the worlds best bands ever put together.
B00005T30L|3.0|Enid and her friend are portrayed as outsiders among their peer group, but, oddly enough, they remind me of many other young people I know these days.  They have this dry sort of mockingly cynical attitude with lots of overstatement, (Enid, \\"If my dad starts to date _____ again, I'll just have to kill myself\\"). Also, Scarlotte Johannson's monotone is perfect here. It seems that they are way too cool to be identified with the stupid mainstream of society, so they start their own society.  After a while Enid and Rebecca just appear to be trying to impress each other with how much they hate everything, and therefore how cool they are.  Rather than being marginalized outsiders, they choose to stand outside and marginalize the \\"insiders\\".     However, real issues of disenfranchisement do exist in the film.  Racism is the obvious one.  At the beginning, the two girls are really a unit: they are always together, they think alike, and they answer questions as if they were one person.  But occasionally, someone refers to them as \\"Enid the Jew and her Aryan friend, Rebecca.\\"  In fact, Rebecca does become separate from Enid, and Enid gradually becomes more and more detached from society. But first Enid doesn't graduate from high school. Enid gets fired from her job.(by her own anti-social behavior). Little wonder that Enid identifies with the racist poster from the \\"Coon Chicken\\" restaurant (a real place, I might add). Ironically, this causes her to flunk summer art, and therefore high school--again--and to loose the promised scholarship to art school, the one place where her quirky thinking might have helped her flourish. Apparently, there is little left for her to do but to ride on some unknown bus into some unknowable destination.

B000MTDRKE|5.0|i just got my copy in the mail yesterday. After eagerly listening to it this morning, I must say this release is masterful! What an amazing artist!! The production and musicianship is fantastic. The music and lyrics are very thoughtful and paint an incredible picture of Martin Luther, and his protest against Catholicism, and what his (Martin Luther) personal struggles must have been in presenting his objections to the Catholic Church and consequently the world at large. <br />If you're a Prog rock fan, then this is a must get. If your not a prog rock fan, then it's still a must get. <br />
B000008LH5|5.0|I have read a few reviews and was \\"touched\\" by the complaints that some CD-issues have ommitted Ric Lee's drumsolo \\"Hobbit\\" and/or shorten the 15 minute track \\"I Can't Keep from Crying Sometimes\\" part 1 and part 2 with in between \\"Extension On One Chord\\" to 3 minutes. This is a shame and foul play by the recording company. I don't know which one has the rights to issue this album. Fortunately there is at least a complete issue by  EMI Plus from 2000 and this have exactly the same tapes, setlist and runningorder and -times from the original double vinylalbum. Elsewhere I read about a new issue with 2 hidden tracks, I dón't know what songs they contain. But beware, you are not getting anything extra for nothing, the risk is there that with 2 songs plus you get less songs from the original contains. Enough said about that, this is classical rock in topnotch. One of the best livealbums ever made. Ten Years After were at the heigth of their career, not much afterwards they sadly declined. Taken from the first album, the above mentioned freewheeling extended song, coupled with \\"Help Me\\" (recorded in the Concertgebouw in Amsterdam at nighttime, I was there!), the slowbuilding but climaxing with speedguitar and overdrive, Williams written bluessongs. Further from \\"Ssssh\\" the downtrodden \\"Good Morning Little Schoolgirl\\" but in the hands of TYA sounding fresh and sparkling (watch the bassplayer!), the heavy opener \\"One of these Days\\" from the excellent \\"A Space in Time\\" to the startling \\"You Give Me Loving\\" from \\"Rock and Roll Music to the World\\", also the homebase of \\"Choo Choo Mama\\" - which is much fatter here -  this album comes as an anthology. You can debate which version of \\"Going Home\\",  the ultimate livestomper, is better but on \\"Recorded Live\\" it is astonishing. Further there is some short chit/chat banter by Alvin Lee on guitar, which is amusing to say the least,  he can do anything with a guitar and make it sound what he wants. amazing. A true performer and lightningfast guitarplayer, besides excellent singer/songwriter. That doesn't say the other musicians were lesser gods, they not only fullfilled their task in the shadow of Lee but made together the sound.    <br />Ric Lee (no family) shows what a drummer he was in \\"Hobbit\\" and Leo Lyons bass was booming all the time. On this live album Chuck Churchill playes somewhat a lesser role, maybe the keyboards are simply to low in the mix. On other albums his musicianship on organ, piano, electric piano and synthesizer can be heard without doubt. I love this album very much, it is timeless. Check also out the earlier recorded \\"Live at the Fillmore\\", which was issued a quarter of a century later for the first time. All in all Ten Years After were a liveact but also able to make about 10 studioalbums, with everything from pure blues, jazz, hardrock, to pop and folkrock. To remember them only from Woodstock doesn't do them justice.
B0002IU988|5.0|The number one question in most people's minds when they hear of Alter Bridge is; Do they sound like Creed?  The answer is no, not really.  The song that sounds most like Creed is Open Your Eyes and none of the other songs on the cd sound like Open Your Eyes.  Creed had an alternative streak (Say I, Wrong Way, etc) where as Alter Bridge sounds like straight up rock n' roll.  The guitar work on this album is VERY VERY good!  Myles Kennedy has a great voice.  He'll shock you with some of his work, for instance, his last notes on Find the Real.  Myles is a tenor and sounds very different compared to Scott Stapp.  He's actually quite a better singer than Stapp too.  Maybe a little less feel (for some people) but much better singing.  The highlights here and when I mean highlights I mean you have to hear these songs at least once in your life are; <br />Find the Real--Great intro with double bass and solos thrown throughout each and every chorus and solo in the bridge!  Blew me away when I first heard it.  Hard and heavy but not fast. <br />One Day Remains--More modern rock than hard rock with an alternative feel.  Very and I mean very fast verse riff with a huge flurry of notes.  Cool little sweep solo in the bridge.  It's a little repetitive but the amazing verse and anthemic chorus will have you singing along. <br />Metallingus--Very hard and heavy and fast.  The closest thing to metal on this cd.  The bridge has a very cool start/stop heavy riff with some amazing runs thrown in.  Closes out with double bass and heavy guitars that remind me of the bridge. <br />Broken Wings--Tremonti writes beautiful ballads and here's a darker more bleak sounding ballad than anything he's ever written.  Great bluesy fingerpicked intro with a simple verse and chorus that make you feel the MELODY sung by Myles Kennedy.  Oh, and even though the guitar work is \\"simple\\" it's actually quite complex with some weird sounding chords and octave chord slides that spice up the chorus without making the guitar the highlight. <br />Shed My Skin--Softer ballad type song.  The lyrics are what really get you on this one. <br />The End is Here--Epic and awesome.  Explodes from the verse to the chorus.  Middle Eastern sounding with again great runs and riffs.  Heavy like Find the Real in the verse (but in the chorus) and with a darker feel than Find the Real.  This is THE track on the cd. <br />The rest of the cd is not as impressive but these tracks are amazing!  Alter Bridge definitely has a harder and heavier vibe to them then Creed did.  The cd is a mix of hard rock and a softer (but not soft) rock.  The guitar work (again) NEEDS to be heard.  This cd had me mesmerized for a couple months.  The only complaint would be that they need to follow in the vein of Find the Real and The End is Here more than Shed My Skin and a couple other tracks if they really want to do something distinctive from the TYPE of music they've made in the past.  Again every song on here is great but it sounds like Alter Bridge tried to move in one direction and then had to compromise a little (with their record label).  Their next cd should be all them and I can't wait to hear it.

B000FVBLEI|5.0|I was hesitant to buy this album because it's the hardest music I've ever really bought a full cd of.  After listening to The Weak Willed on their website I became hooked.  I figured if I could like a song that hard on the album then I'd definitely like the whole album.  The highlights of this album are the drums, guitars, and vocals.  What's really going to catch your attention first are the vocals.  Phil can growl, scream, screech, shout, sing, and mix up all those categories and you actually hear the different tones.  One of the best singers around period.  Oh, and the guitar work is [...] brilliant!  There's the anthemic power metal feel here mixed with some grinding and fast heavy metal to death metal guitar work.  Very fast triplets and palm mutes mixed with some beautiful note and chord selection.  The whole album is 40% melody and 60% brutal hard riffs.  Vocals are like 35 and 65%.  The best three tracks are; This Calling, The Weak Willed, and Indictment.  The only song that earns 4 stars here is Empty Inside.  It just lacks the sparkle the other tracks have.  Not innovative but definitely creative, great song structures with good melodic solos.  Has personality, it's not just one of the crowd.
B000KCHZK6|2.0|I bought this after seeing her recent interview with somebody or other.  I loved her first two CDs, expected to love this one.  But I consider it just so-so.   <br /> <br />A little lackluster.  Borders on the irritating.  My daughter, who has also loved her past CDs made no comment.     <br /> <br />So-so.
0060776757|5.0|Was totally impressed - this is not a book to read from cover to cover all at once -  just pick pages at a time; skip around and totally enjoy!! <br />A real coffee table book - some nights I spend an hour reading; sometimes just a few minutes; sometimes just look at pictures. Have read many things several times. Worth every penny!!
B000M341QE|4.0|In this movie everyone but Mark Wahlberg is shot in the face, before this an intricate game of cat and mouse takes place where two people are half-cat half-mouse creatures on the hunt and hunted by each other. An excellent flick to bring a date to. I give it an A-.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|<br />Great British acting, a funny and entertaining story with several plots running parallel throughout the movie and eventually, \\"actually\\" coming all together in the end.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|I, among many others have mixed feelings on this release.  Here's a straightforward review - <br /> <br />WHY IT'S GREAT:  The sheer audio quality!  Among the myriad Beatles compilations in recent years, this is really the only one worthy of the label \\"remastered\\".  George Martin's production experience really shows through.  Every sound is crisp, clear, resonant, and perfectly balanced.  I always thought the overly distorted electric guitar (couldn't be helped, considering the time it was produced) on 'Revolution' was somewhat hard to bear. This version is a pleasure to listen too! <br /> <br />WHAT'S NOT SO GREAT:  Some of the remixed aspects.  Most songs are assembled well, ingeniously even, but a few just don't sound right.  I, among many others didn't like the a capella versions of 'Because' and 'Sun King'.  While interesting, taking away the music was like taking away a building's framework, if that makes any sense.  The lyrics are too integral to the music to simply take it away.  Some of the istrumentals on 'Here comes the Sun' were out of place as well.  And one might expect introducing 'Yesterday' with 'Blackbird' to work, but it just...didn't sound right.  The metrics were too different. <br /> <br />This being said, don't worry.  It's definetely worth getting!  Most songs are subtley and seamlessly mixed to create amazing compositions.  Take 'Strawberry Fields' for example.  The first half has only quiet additions that don't change the song's original scope, but it flawlessly transitions in the second half to a harmonious explosion of 'Hello Goodbye', 'Piggies', and 'PennyLane'.   <br /> <br />If your tired of the endless barrage of repackaged Beatles hits or want a fresh spin on some old classics then don a good pair of headphones, and get and earfull of LOVE.
B000MNP2K8|5.0|I'M A FULL TIME JAMES BOND FAN, AND .....WHAT A WONDERFUL MOVIE......THE BEST WAY TO SHOW THE BEGINING OF BOND....AND WHAT TO SAY ABOUT DANIEL CRAIG....EXCELLENT ACTOR
B00004RF8J|5.0|It's true. A talking alien plant set to take over the world, a hero out of a zero, three Ronettes-esque ladies with fantastic voices, a sadistic dentist - this movie is awesome.  The music numbers will give you chills, especially \\"Skid Row.\\"  You won't be disappointed.
B0009W5K0Y|5.0|If you enjoy similar artists such as The Hush Sound, Flyleaf, and even Avril Lavigne, you'll find this album enjoyable to listen to.  Emergency and Pressure obviously stand out as some of the band's stronger tracks on the album.  All We Know is also a highly popular track.  The band's overall sound is pretty consistent throughout the entire album, and often reflects a sound similar to the Chicago-based band The Hush Sound, but with a more heavier, harder quality.  Paramore is one of the few newer post-punk/emo bands to produce a catchy album that is strong from start to finish.  The Summer Tic EP (2006) also features memorable tracks from the band such as Emergency (Crab Mix) and \\"Stuck On You,\\" which is a cover of a song by Failure.  All We Know Is Falling is certainly an album worth checking out. <br />
B000MNP2KI|5.0|This James Bond is for \\"real men\\". The days of the foppish Roger Moore are gone hopefully? The James Bond of old (Sean) were great with the exception of the smoking, there were gadgets and puns, but the whole movie wasn't centered around them, it was location, good vs. evil, and of course the women.<br /><br />Some how the series got off on the laser watches, exploting bedpans etc, and the most thinnly veiled ploys to nail the female counter parts. All well and good for 14 year old boys with feverish delusions about the male vs. female interaction.<br /><br />Eva Green plays the counter balance part to Bond. She is not enthralled with him at first, actually she is quite bright, reserved and can penetrate his self defense mechanisim, and leaves him hanging in the rail car.<br /><br />She has him on a short monitary leash, picks his clothes, and plays by her own rules, which is a far cry from the usual plyable playmate of James' Ultimately she saves his life at the cost of her own.<br /><br />This entry in the Bond series is a thinking mans version of Bond, with more of a respect for women, but not a wimp!!<br /><br />The stunt scenes are outrageous, running up the boom of a crane, jumping from the elevator to another floor during descent, and leaping off of a moving truck in the opening ten minutes is enough to get the ol' ticker going. The balance of the stunts are all original, the bad guys are believeable, and the scenery is excellent.<br /><br />No Bond fan will be disappointed, alot of 13 year old boys will be, and the foppish, simpering, sensitive, new age guys should stick to watching \\"Lost In Translation.\\" I hope all of the Bond movies are re-made in this style.<br /><br />For the girls Bond is fit and swim suit nude (a la Ursella in Dr No) , and for the guys \\"Eva\\" is, ..... well ....... the girl next door on steriods ....... I guess my style of movie appreciations \\"are the characters believable\\". Arnold S as Conan is believable. Arnold in the King's Speach is beyond the pale. I watch the Transformers with my grandson (7 yo) for the imagination and special effects. This version of Bond is more of a drama than the \\"ooooh James\\" dialogue from the past 30 years. The story was updated to have modern villany (terrorist and stock market criminals). Vesper is her own woman, plays by her own rules, and 'skewers' Bond in the dining car. She is far from a bimbo. She doesn't like/care/approve of Bond at first, but comes to underand what he does has made him what he is.<br />I guess you have to be a baby boomer, to truly appreciate Bond films. I just saw Skyfall and it wasn't as good as the 'Royale. I have seen them all, and this is the best.
B000002B30|3.0|If it weren't for the four previously unreleased songs, this seems like a collection thrown together by somebody who knows the bare minimum about Sprigsteen, for somebody who knows the bare minimum about Springsteen. This means his career apparently began with Born to Run, rather than Greetings from Asbury Park, N.J. - suffice it to say you can forget about seeing Blinded By the Light, Sandy or Rosalita (to say nothing of Spirit in the Night, For You, Lost in the Flood or Kitty's Back). And this set tears through his at-that-point over twenty years of recording in the bat of an eye, completely slighting important albums like Born to Run, The River (two tracks each), and Darkness on the Edge of Town (one). And it's not like Jungleland, Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out, Backstreets, She's the One, The Promised Land, Prove It All Night, Darkness on the Edge of Town, Independence Day and Wreck on the Highway are obscure trifles. Nebraska is overrated, but the title song, Reason to Believe and Johnny 99 are all among Springsteen's best (and best-known, thanks to Johnny Cash's cover of the latter). Born in the U.S.A., however, is treated exquisately (other than the absences of Bobby Jean and Darlington County), and this easily covers the key tracks on Tunnel of Love, Human Touch, and (other than its title track) Lucky Town. Streets of Philidelphia (released for the soundtrack to the movie of the same name) is a key addition to the Springsteen catalogue, justly nailing a Grammy. Sadly, I can't get excited about the four new songs (other than Murder, Incorporated) -  three of them should've been canned.
074356619X|5.0|It's worthing giving to family, friends, loved ones and anyone who needs help with the day to day living of life.  <br />  I'm surprised by the negative attitudes of so many people. Life was never meant to be harmful, painful and destructive. What if religion and death are the biggest lies ever created by mankind? How can God be loving and there be so much pain and destruction in the world? Well, God doesn't have anything to do with the negative side of life, we do that all by ourselves and then we blame God for all the bad that happens to us. The Secret is that we are in control, we are responsible, we choose the lives we lead, which also means we can change anything about this life we truly desire to change. We want death, poverty, and disease to stop, then we need to stop settling for less in life. We need to demand better world leaders and be willing to help provide for those whom have far less than we do. We are being given opportunities to become better individuals and better societies. <br /> <br />  Religion has not cured any of the worlds ills. It has not stopped people from dying. It does not provide \\"real\\" answers other than you must have \\"faith\\" because religion says so. I have asked may religious leaders \\"why are we here?\\" Is this all there is to life? Not one of them gave me an answer that made sense, because they really don't have a clue. <br />God or \\"a higher power\\" or \\"the light of creation\\" however you wish to describe this positve power is just that \\"POSITIVE\\". It's we humans that are \\"Negative\\" and most of these reviews show just how negative individuals can be.  <br /> <br />  We want so save the environment, then start buying hybird cars, recycle like Japan does. Societies do not change untill the individuals living in that society demand change. We are the greatest nation in the world and we give the least amount of money to the poverty stricken areas of the world. Why? Because we do not demand our government to do more because most of America doesn't want to rock the boat and maybe lose a portion of what we have to someone else. We need to complain less and do more to make positve changes that will make death, disease and poverty things of the past. We have all the power we need within ourselves if we are willing to use it for the well being of all of us and our planet. <br /> <br />  Rhonda Byrne has tried to do something positive that will help everyone in the world. But of course, you have to be open and willing to listen. Ask yourself what have you done lately that has helped the world be a safer place for all of us to live in? You maybe surprised if you answer that question honestly. And simply writing a check for charity isn't enough.
B000MTPANQ|5.0|I have been waiting for a release like this ever since I am began to reall enjoy Neil Young. The excitement I felt when I read that this was coming out was indescribable. I am a relatively young Neil Young fan (20 years old) and appreciate all types of music, new and old. I have to tell you, though, this might become my favorite album of all time. Honestly, there is not one bad track on this album. We've all heard most of these songs before, but these versions are all superior to any studio tracks or any other live versions of these songs. I thought nothing could ever top the acoustic side of \\"Live Rust,\\" but \\"Live at Massey Hall\\" blows that out of the water. Stand-outs include \\"Ohio,\\" \\"Helpless,\\" \\"Old Man,\\" and the simply amazing \\"Journey Through the Past.\\" How that song is not a mainstream Neil Young song is amazing, because it is simply gorgeous on this album. I recommend this album to anyone who enjoys music. It is sure to not disappoint. Thanks Neil for this masterpiece.
B000HEWEE4|5.0|i love this movie. i like movies that are kind of with a time-warp. sandra bullock's character is living in 2006 and keanu reeves' character is living in 2004. they communicate with each other by writing letters. they put their letters in the same mail box and they some how receive each others letters. it's a one of a kind love story because they truly do fall in love. with their love between letters they want to meet, but how with 2 years apart? this is a must see. and at the end you get goosebumps with a chill... but trust me, you'll love it!
B000LXH0AE|4.0|This is truly a great movie.<br /><br />At the beginning of the film I was starting to get rather bored and bogged down with all the talks of numbers and the personification of Harold Crick (Will Ferrell)'s wristwatch, but as the movie progressed I found it very touching and entertaining.  Ferrell, Hoffman and Gyllenhaal do an amazing acting job, and they really make you feel as if you know them.  Queen Latifa and Emma Thompson presented pretty much run of the mill throw away roles, and I really would have been happy with a lot less of them in the movie.  The extra features really weren't that great either, and the deleted scenes should have been left on the cutting room floor, but when the ending credits came up, I really did leave with the feeling of \\"that was an awesome movie.\\"

This really is the best book I have ever read.<br /><br />Frey's use of gut retching imagery and his unique writing style gets the reader totally immersed in this book, feeling as though they are really involved in the narrative, and Frey's character development really leaves the readers feeling as if they know these people personally.<br /><br />I have never been more entertained and drawn into a book in my life.  I do not care if a few details are fabricated or if the entire book is a lie, this is the best piece of modern literature out there.

It has a feature where it notifies you whenever there is an \\"action\\" you are supposed to perform when at a theater.  Another feature actually allows you to see clips of people performing at theaters whenever they come to the scene of the movie.<br /><br />You will not be disappointed with this purchase.

0743496728|4.0|I have read every single one of Picoult's books ~~ starting with my first read, \\"Keeping Faith\\" and now with this one. As always Picoult addresses tough situations and tries to address both sides of an issue. She has covered a wide variety of topics like date rape, whether or not a sister should be responsible for her sister, and now, school shootings. This one covers school shootings and what happened to bring it to a horrible day that leaves scars across the town of Sterling ~~ both visible and invisible ~~ and the aftermath that still shakes. <br /> <br />Peter is a boy who has been picked on since kindergarten. On the very first day of school, he watches the older kids throw his brand new Superman lunch box out the window. Small and slight, he has been overlooked by everyone, including his parents (who favored his older brother, Joey who also was one of the bullies). All Peter wanted was to be left alone but since he was not one of the \\"popular\\" kids and he didn't have any friends (other than Josie, who stopped being his friend in sixth grade) ~~ he was constantly belittled and embarrassed by the jocks, till he reached a breaking point.  <br /> <br />Josie is the daughter of a judge. She seems to be perfect ~~ always wearing the right clothes, dating the star hockey player, hanging out with the right crowd, but ridden with guilt and shame and confusion because she doesn't feel as \\"together\\" as her friends are. She was friends with Peter since infancy till they stopped being friends in middle school. This is her story too. <br /> <br />This novel covers all sides of the issue ~~ what really happened to Peter to bring him to shoot down 29 kids, killing 10 of them? What about his parents? His parents suffered too as they realized it was their son who did this horrible deed (no parents ever dream of their kids doing that ...) and Alex, Josie's mom, how does she cope with the fact that she almost lost her daughter in that terrifying massacre and still be a judge? There are plenty of raw emotions that are covered in this book and unbelievable scope of horror. It addresses bullying, the breaking point and peer pressure among the kids. It addresses kids trying to survive the aftermath and growing up too soon.  <br /> <br />The reason why this is a four star instead of a five ~~ the last few chapters, I felt, were written so hastily and I wasn't surprised by the twist ending at all as well as feeling as if there were more to be said, but it just ended abruptly. Other than that, this is a compelling read and one that covers a scary topic for this mom of preschoolers! How do you make sure that your kids won't turn out to be like Peter in this book or any of the other kids who have been bullied to the extent that he was? How do you make sure that your kids will treat others nicer and perhaps more compassionate? Parenting isn't an exact science as this book will prove ~~ and perhaps, that's the hardest lesson out of all of Picoult's books.  <br /> <br />3-15-07

B000MXPE74|5.0|Following the release of their previous EP, Flathead EP, in January, The Fratellis (Jon Fratelli-lead vocals/guitar, Barry Fratelli-bass guitar and Mince Fratelli-drums) blast into the United States with their infectious debut album, Costello Music. Already gaining steam from the song \\"Flathead,\\" which is currently being used in the iPod commercials, the Fratellis bring a raw garage sound with just a little bit of punk to add some flavor.  Of course the Fratellis should not be written off as another pop/punk clone like crap bands such as Fall Out Boy, My Chemical Romance or Good Charlotte.  Already a huge sensation in their native Scotland, the Fratellis come stateside armed with ear catching pop hooks and play back value in every song. I almost feel like I hurt the band's integrity by calling them \\"punk.\\" In fact, their not.  That is why the Fratellis are already an elite band compared to their so-called indie, garage or punk peers.  They refuse to follow the mainstream music style other bands like to catch on to.  Costello Music is a genius blend of garage glam-power pop that gets the listeners foot tapping right off the bad.  The previously mentioned \\"Flathead\\" and the 50s type rocker \\"Creepin Up The Backstairs\\" are easily the stand out tracks of the album.  \\"Henrietta\\" makes you want to get up and dance and the Kinks inspired \\"Whistle For The Choir\\" might possibly make you whistle along in good fun.  The Clash like \\"Chelsea Dagger\\" also rocks in the style of a \\"do do do do...\\" Both \\"Whistle For The Choir\\" and \\"Chelsea Dagger\\" were both top ten hits in the UK.  Costello Music might be one of the best albums so for this years. Excellent album for a power charged band that knows how to play but also has a great time doing it.

0451450523|3.0|I thought this book was okay but by no means a classic. I thought the story was interesting enough but overall a little dull. I thought the writing was okay but I noticed I got lost a little bit here and there. I also had to fight to keep awake reading it because it just wasn't that interesting. I didn't think the characters were all that well definied or were not as loveable/hateable etc as you would like to see in any book.   <br /> <br />Anyway, overall it's a decent book. It's interesting enough, it's a decent short and quick book for kids but it, to me, shouldn't have classic written all over it.

Just when you think you figure things out there is another twist in the story.<br /><br />The plot goes like this: Vida Winter is an author that has been writting books for about 60 years. She however does not like to tell about her past though and when it comes time to be interviewed after a book has come out she makes something up. That is until now. She is dieing and wants Margaret Lea her real story.<br /><br />Margaret has always been surounded by books, but is not sure she is the right person to right the story. Once she hears it thought, she is hooked.<br /><br />Vida starts telling her about Isabelle and Charles Angelfield and their life along with Isabelle's twins Adeline and Emmeline and the stuff that the twins pull. From stealing a baby to play in its pram, to not wanting to meet their new nanny to distroying John the diggs garden every adventure draws both Margaret and the reader into the story untill the ending, which explains alot.<br /><br />All in all a fantastic book I could not stop reading!
B000002UB3|5.0|Abey Road has to be the best of The Beatles as an album. The \\"b side\\" songs are great too and I often found them the best part of it. It is really a must in my collection, after a couple years and some scratches I decided to buy a new one, yes its that great!
1400133785|4.0|Dawkins has a great range of arguments that point to the non-existence of God that anyone should read, whether they agree or not because it will challenge, clarify and strengthen thinking.   <br /> <br />Dawkins does a disservice to his book by aggressively going for the jugular from the first word as this will deter many readers he would probably want to reach.  <br /> <br />Also, the endless list of people he quotes as stating something to support/ not support the existence of God becomes like a school-yard \\"he-said, she-said, then he-said\\" which no one can really win.  Richard D: this comes across as petty bickering and makes you seem unpleasant, however right you might be; don't alienate your audience! <br /> <br />By blaming religion for the deaths in the Crusades through to 9-11 etc on religion, Dawkins misses the point.  Religion has always been hijacked for other purposes, usually delivering greater power and wealth to a very small number of people.  So, it is not religion that is the issue.  By hijacking this to support his argument, Dawkins commits the same 'sin'. <br /> <br />Similarly, he quotes various points of culture (current or historical) as if they were directly religious, such as the headscarf worn by some Muslim women, when they are more the extension of some (current or historical) cultural aspect of the people involved with the religion at some point.  The fuss in the west about headscarves has made it an icon of Islamic identity that mean some Muslim women will wear it to make a point or as a protest against western imperialism. <br /> <br />Even if you are an atheist from Europe or N America, you still have a strong sense of what is 'right or wrong' based on the culture of the society you were marinated in as you grew-up.   After many hundreds of years of Christianity in Europe, the laws of European countries reflect beliefs from Christianity.  Thus, religion provides/ed societal rules that adults only become conscious of when moving to another country. In other countries, everyone does certain things consistently differently and this may lead to the realisation that one society's way of acting is just as good an alternative as another. <br /> <br />Hence, Dawkins could probably have looked at the considerable similarities among beliefs and cultures of The Children of Abraham and the hypocrisy of claiming hair-splitting differences in the name of God. <br /> <br />This is a controversial book that everyone should read as it's shadow will stretch long in the future and wide across the people of this planet.  If you don't know the arguments for and against the existence God, do you really have a right to an opinion? <br /> <br />The God Delusion is a great read, very stimulating and very clear about what it wants to achieve: reducing the probability of God's existence to almost zero - and I agree, agree that God can't quite be ruled out. <br /> <br />Timbo, Australia <br />
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This gigantic effort is excellent.  The episodes are to the point but also include a great deal of understanding of just how horrid WWII was for the countries devastated during the nearly six years a insanity.  From the opening of each episode, replete with faces in the fire and unforgetable music, to the recap the photgraphy and sound track and the elegant narration by Olivier to the completion excellence abounds.  It would be fruitless to contrast The World at War with the garbage that abounds on commercial tv today, but it's sad to think how far we have fallen, from the sublime to the witless, eg Survivor, American Idol, etc.
B000AP04OM|5.0|Great gift for a child that likes to sing or any child.  Children are so inundated with material that isn't appropriate, this is wholesome family fun.  The sound of music is just wonderful to have as a part of your movie collection.  I thought this MTV generation may have rejected it, but my 11 year old daughter absolutely loves it.
0060763280|3.0|T. Harv Eker is blunt when making observations about your shorfallings, his solution to growth and wealth creation is confronting, and his underlying belief is that you can be what you want to be if you are prepared to look in the mirror and change the way you think. This is a good, thought provoking read on self improvement and wealth creation. It is a book you can return to and find useful hints on you, focus, wealth creation and personal growth.
B0000DZ3IG|4.0|If you even just liked the movie you will love the sound track.  There were a couple of songs that I didn't even remember from the movie but it was awesome.
B000M4RG4C|4.0|A couple of years ago I read this book about the bloody battle for Iwo Jima and having actually served in the U. S. Marine Corps for 39 months, I identify with the history of The Corps and their famous battles.  Therefore, I was keen on seeing this movie version of the book when it was released.  The movie follows the book quite closely and does not glorify any of the actors, which is a refreshing change after having always been previously fed so many Hollywood glamorized war movie versions such as John Wayne starring in The Sands of Iwo Jima or Aldo Ray in Battle Cry.  The movie doesn't particularly follow any story line other than the sequence of the invasion and the actual flag raising and the confusion caused later to the participants.  The battle scenes are more like video bytes and snap shots and fairly graphic which I believe is probably more true to life with the experience of intense battle punctuated by moments of terror and tragedy.  The ignominious ending of Ira Hayes is a sad commentary about a time in our nations history when we treated native Americans very poorly.
B0000640VN|5.0|When I bought this movie I didn't realize the Director's Cut version was also on it.  I think the Director's Cut version makes the movie more interesting.  I love the theatrical version but the Director's Cut adds a twist that really makes it intriguing.
B000LPQ6DE|1.0|I have to disagree with the reviewers who loved this.  I found it dull and boring with almost no chemistry between the two leads.  Jane Eyre is one of my favorite stories; I've seen all the other filmed versions and this is nowhere near the best.  (My favorite is with Timothy Dalton and Zela Clark.)  I actually found myself wishing this one would end quickly. The only actor who did well, in my opinion, was the one who played St. John.
B000005J56|3.0|I have had this album a number of years, and my enthusiasm is not quite as great as many of the viewers here, because although it is generally pleasant listening, I don't think there are really any outstanding tracks or personal favorites on here.<br /><br />I should add that I speak Spanish fairly well and therefore understand the lyrics, and am generally an enthusiast of Hispanic culture and music. The story of this worthy project and how this was recorded are interesting and I suspect some reviewers are moved more by sentiment than just on the merits of the music, some of which seems very middle-of-the-road to me, albeit pleasant enough for casual listening.
B00000JNNY|5.0|My husband and I played At last at our wedding, Classic!
B000IFQLSW|5.0|10 Days Out: Blues From The Backroads is one of the finest Blues albums to come out in some time. Anyone listening to the album also needs to view the DVD, which puts the entire project into perspective.<br /><br />Kenny Wayne Shepherd spent ten days on the road, sought out and recorded songs with some of the greatest, down-home legends in contemporary Blues music. Many of the songs are absolutely pure in their authenticity. Ultimately, the album also becomes a historical documentary, as some of those who recorded with Kenny Wayne did so for the last time, and have since passed away.<br /><br />The CD and DVD are a phenomenal project and a worthy testimony to how treasured the heritage of the Blues is in our American culture.  If you like the Blues, this CD and DVD are well worth the investment.  Hats off to Kenny Wayne Shepherd and everyone who participated in this important Blues album.
0316172324|3.0|Gladwell writes very well.  Blink captured my attention for the few hours it took to read it, and it was hard to put down.  The problem is that Gladwell focuses more on fluff than on substance.  He practices what he preaches, \\"thinking without thinking.\\"  The end result is a book that is entertaining without educating.  For me, that is not enough.<br /><br />As Thomas Edison was fond of saying, \\"There is no expedient to which a man will not resort to avoid the real labor of thinking.\\"  Gladwell gives us lazy people an excuse to rely on our intuition and avoid thinking.  But can we tap the power of thinking without thinking?  I don't think so.<br /><br />Although not as well-written, and nowhere near as popular, I found Michael LeGault's critique of Blink, titled Think, the better book.  In my mind, better think than blink.
B000L43P1G|5.0|First off, I love George Michael, so I may be biased.  However, my husband is not the seasoned fan that I am, so this 3 disc set is required listening in my car.  It gets him reacquainted with George.  The few new songs are fantastic and I wish he was played on the radio in the US.  He has a powerhouse voice that can do upbeat and slow songs equally well!
B000K7VHQE|1.0|A better title would have been Little Miss Useless Flogging of the Fbomb.  Boring, offensive, and unoriginal.  I could hardly make it all the way through.  To award Alan Arkin an oscar for his performance is an insult to any moviegoer's intelligence.  Although I recognized and appreciated the \\"type\\" each character was intended to portray, none were compelling enough to keep my attention.  I was too embarrassed to have this DVD in my collection, so I scratched it up with a knife and chucked it in the trash.
0152048049|4.0|i have the 50th anniversary edition - it is bigger and my expectation was greater - so i was some what disapointed - it is still nice and the story is wonderful.
B000F3TBIO|5.0|I gpt the cd in  5 day in awsome shape couldnt be happier.
1582701709|5.0|I am so thankful that I took the time to order 'The Secret' in all three formats; DVD, Book and CD!  I have been listening to the CD every day while on the road for work.  It's not new brain surgery, however 'The Secret' has brought  back to the forefront what I/we NEED to do.  I will continue to listen, watch and read this wonderful material as often as possible for the rest of my life!
B000GY729M|5.0|Normally I only do reviews for CDs I REALLY REALLY like, so here I am! Where to start.. in my opinion, this album comes pretty close to musical perfection. I agree with many of the reviews that you have to listen to it about 3 or 4 times to really appreciate it. It's a completely different style from Hot Fuss, and if you really like songs like \\"Smile like you mean it\\" for example, you may not like this one as much, as it isn't as outright loud and rock ish sounding, even though there still are rock songs. Nonetheless, my favourite songs are \\"Read my mind\\", \\"When we were young\\", \\"List\\" and \\"Why do I keep counting\\". I think the music the killers have come up with in this cd is much more to my personal taste - in the 3 or 4 days I've had it, I've already listened to it more than I have Hot Fuss, which I've had for years. I was quite surprised to see that there are actually a few soft, romantic love songs, (which I didn't know the killers could pull off!). And, not in a cheesy way, but this cd has a much more inspirational and uplifting tone [you'll see what I mean if / when you buy it], and besides \\"Mr. Brightside\\", I didn't find too many songs on Hot Fuss to be 'pretty' with beautiful melodies, but this cd's packed with them. It's just great songs after great songs. Basically this cd gets better and better everytime I listen to it, and I find myself constantly tapping my feet or nodding my head, and in general, this CD makes me smile whenever I hear it. It would be a HUGE mistake not to buy it, and I think anyone could enjoy it, whether you're a killers fan or not. Plus, if you like any of their releases, I can almost guarantee you'll love \\"Sam's town\\". So quit reading the reviews and run out and grab this baby!!
0446528056|5.0|Not your typical \\"Dear John\\" letter but this book is in typical Nicholas Sparks style.  Full of feeling,life, and love, just couldn't put it down.
B00005MCX3|5.0|This is definitely the most \\"musical\\" of the earlier Hawkwind catalog.Lost Johnny is the standout track for me,with vocals lent from Lemmy(later of Motorhead fame).it's more of a song structured album as opposed to the earlier spacey 13 minute dabblings of previous recordings.A great introduction to any interested party.Definitely a must have for any rock collection.
B00005JPLU|3.0|The film is a jarring inconsistency of some of the most well chirographed fight scene ever yet filmed, some completely over the top fantasy creaturish humans (in a supposedly historical setting), some flinchingly bad dialog, and really embarrassingly comic book scenes and caricatures.    I loved this film, and I hated the guys who screwed it up.  This film had truly great potential with a far deeper plot than Braveheart, greater scope and even greater armies than Lord of the Rings.      But things were just wrong, the consummating moment for the hero of the story was cut short like it had begun and was instantly edited to the end for no apparent reason.  The Introduction to the hero looked like a scene for Jungle Book, it actually had a Wolf with glowing eyes.  Much of the dialog looked like it was taken off the back of a patriotic serial box and then just Greekified and repeated with no apparent rhythm, and almost comically the soundtrack seemed to try to beef up every really bad section of dialog with really grand music.    This film could have been great instead it's only good; but giving honor to whom it is due.  It has what is probably a three minute sword fight complete with about twenty kills done from one camera angle.  In terms of filming, it is a triumph like nothing I've ever seen; and in terms of viewing, you've got to see it!  So many things in there are still that good that I totally recommend it.  I just doubt it will be the best watch of your life.
B000301YY8|5.0|Heard bits and pieces of this album for some time but finally purchased it and I am not disappointed.  Each piece is wonderful.  Love his voice.  I will buy more of his music.
0679777547|3.0|An interesting framework that combines elements of Dumas, Sherlock Holmes, Phillip Marlowe, and The Da Vinci Code that, at least for me, didn't quite work.<br /><br />I actually thought The Club Dumas started out quite well - I flew through the first 100 pages thoroughly engrossed in the story as the mystery was established, but unfortunately it fell flat as it unfolded, in my opinion.  Quite simply, I found the resolution of the various questions/mysteries raised anticlimactic.<br /><br />I will admit I did appreciate finding as many references to Dumas, Conan Doyle, and other works as I could (I'm sure there are a lot I missed, I'm not all that well-read), but for me that didn't make up for a relatively flat story.  I did not, on the other hand, appreciate the frequently awkward attempts at Chandlerian similes.<br /><br />At the risk of stating the obvious, if you're thinking of reading this I would, at the very least, be sure to read The Three Musketeers first.
B000H0MKGK|5.0|I bought this cd because I saw him perform on the grammy awards.  Since listening to his music,  I have purchased his previous cd's.  Love his music and can't wait to get the other cd's that I just purchased.
0143038419|4.0|I am a writer and I found myself  blown away by her clean, elegant style ( maybe even a little jealous).  Not only is she a masterful craftsman, she has had some extraordinary experiences (and some ordinary ones,too) that provide insight for anyone on a spiritual journey of their own.<br /><br />This book has it all: adventure, sex, food.
B000KRNCYY|1.0|The CD did not include many of the best songs that were on the DVD, such as Orinco Flow, Sing Out, and Spanish Lady, as well as others. <br /> <br />Turns out there is a deluxe version that is supposed to include them, but apparently is very hard to find. <br /> <br />Accordingly, this definitely is a classic example of bait and switch marketing.  The producers obviously intended to mislead customers, by using a cover on the CD similar to that on the DVD. <br /> <br />In any event, I will not order the deluxe version.  Fool me once, shame on you.  Fool me twice, shame on me. <br /> <br />Amazon needs to put a disclaimer on this advertisement warning customers that the content of the CD is not the same as the DVD..
B000I5XOVY|4.0|This is not a review of the movie itself (there are other comments and reviews in this one and the dvd version) but a review of the video transfer of this Blu Ray. This is a good looking transfer in 1080p/VC-1 video, colors are very well saturated, blacks are rock solid and the contrast is really good. The audio is in English Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround and encoded at 640kbps. It has a lot of sorround effects specially in the beggining with the   'Matrix'-esque \\"girl with bomb explodes\\" sequence. That sequence in particular is the one you can display to show your blu ray player. <br />The bottom line... it is a nice (but not excellent) action film that will look good in Blu Ray, specially beign one of the first who came out.
020530902X|4.0|I discovered this book early in my career. It greatly improved my written communications. As I moved into executive positions, I have frequently distributed copies to my management teams if I felt their writing needed improvement. Both of my children were also given copies and I often referred them to the book when they were preparing essays and major projects for high school and university courses.<br /><br />I find the concepts even more important with the reliance on e-mail in the workplace.
B000K7VHQ4|3.0|If you are paying any attention to the movie, you can predict the ending pretty quickly.  Aside from that, the cinematography, art direction, special effects and acting make this a glorious piece of work.  So it is enjoyable, even if you already know the end.
B000LXH0AE|2.0|Will Ferrell again proves he is not funny, and there really is nothing about this film that is different from any other.  The script was great and the overall filming was wonderful.   <br /> <br />I just cannot give a film a high rating when the lead actor is a former SNL hack who cannot hack it.  Sure, he was okay on SNL but the film seemed to be two hours of him shouting at walls and people and just trying to look confused or angry, when he cannot do either very well at all.   <br /> <br />I wish he would retire so we could get someone else in there, the fact he is becoming the ultimate hand puppet for comedy films in general is enough to make me want to rent old Star Trek movies.  I do not laugh at him, nor can I take him seriously.  In ten years he will be regarded as a cookie cutter wannabe whose mediocre movies will be lost in space...the space in the dumpster located behind the DVD rental shop! <br /> <br />Great script and bravo to all the other actors, but Will Ferrell ruins this film with an inept underachieving portrayal that is withering and wounded.
B000M5AJQS|5.0|Great movie! You won't be disappointed with this Boston based action thriller!
B000003TA4|2.0|Okay when it came out (beat \\"Bleach\\" anyway), but looking back? Look hard enough and you'll see a generic corporate rock album. It's got to be one of the most front-loaded albums of all time. Seriously, have you ever heard any songs off side B on the radio? The first six songs are the singles. Even \\"Thriller\\" mixed it up better than that. Also the fuzzed-out boy band photos - in one Kurt is giving us the bird! What a scamp! In all honesty, I change the station when one of these songs come on. I'm tired of them, and you don't get tired of classics.
0307237699|5.0|This is a smart and thoughtful man, as evidenced by his 2 books.  I could only wish to understand our world and its peoples as well as Barack does, and then to write about it eloquently too!  People say he is too inexperienced to be president, but I don't think so.  Let him tell you about his life, his struggles, his multi-cultural background (add Africa and Indonesia to the United States), his thoughts on history and most importantly his ideas for our collective future.  So far, he has my vote for President in 2008!

B000MXPE74|5.0|I just bought this album. I'd never heard of The Fratellis before, but I read the great reviews of this Glasgow group, and I previewed the songs on iTunes and really liked what I heard. Still, I was blown away once I listened to the whole album after buying it. WOW! These guys are amazing. I totally recommend this album for anyone who loves amazing rock. I am sure this group will become huge!!! I have never heard better! Each track is unique in its own way, their style overall is loud, fast, and extremely talented. The harmonies and vocals are pleasant in the extreme and a couple songs verge on punk without being cliche, due to the refreshingly unique harmonics. It's like the Beatles and the Clash merged into a wonderful new beast, with a bit of Arctic Monkey and the Kooks thrown in.
0066620996|5.0|<br />I read the book without an eye towards public corporations, but thinking of organizations in general.  I found the book to be quite encouraging.  Basically, organizations become great when they ruthlessly focus on a single mission that they are good at (and have a passion for), keep the lines of communication and feedback open so that they can keep that focus, and pursue people who selflessly work towards that focus (without ego or their own blustering getting in the way).  I found this finding to be quite affirming. <br /> <br />The first chapter on good-to-great leaders was probably the best chapter: the best leaders are humble and selfless.  Chapter 4 - Confront the Brutal Facts - was also great: great organizations create an atmosphere where honest feedback and constructive criticism is welcomed. <br /> <br />The prose was a bit folksy, but very readable. <br /> <br />

1582701709|1.0|While positive thinking is never a bad thing, you should not need a book replete with new age psycho babble and banal generalities in order to get it. This book is pandering to your base emotions and makes pretend that if you wish hard enough for something it will happen. No it won't. Wishing won't make the cancer disappear, or your sex change, or your leg grow back, or your son come back to life or any number of countless horrible things that happen to normal people.  \\"Lifestyle\\" books like this that make pretend that if you make a wish it will become true are simply fads. This book will end up in the remainder bin just like all those that preceded it. Save your money and start setting yourself realistic goals and expectations if you really want to change your life in a positive way.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|I finally got to see this movie last night, and I LOVED it!!!  I rank it right up there with Notting Hill as one of my favorite romances of all time.  Definitely one that I will purchase and watch over and over again.
B000A6T1JU|4.0|I personally think that the original version without any comics and the introduction was way better.  It seem that every time that a director tries to improve their work, they end up messing it.  It still remains as a great picture and the performance and setting still look great to me... <br /> <br />The score is awesome and the quality of the image its outstanding (at least on my screen).  Not a bad option but if you can get the old one I would recomend to stick to it...
6305291446|5.0|Thank you God! Finally, the looong wait is over! A decent sequel to the first two movies! Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis) is back! She's 20 years older (yet, still beautiful), tougher, and wiser. Laurie now works at a private school in California, where she struggles to forget that night in 1978. Her son John (Josh Hartnet) is enrolled in the same school and must face the very devil that haunts / hunts his mum. Though there is a relatively low body count, H2O delivers good suspense and more intelligence than the idiotic sequels 4-6 (I don't consider H3 a sequel). H2O is the perfect finalé to the trilogy. Unfortunately, HALLOWEEN RESURRECTION exists now, and I'm sure that hollywood will crank out fifty more just like it...
B000LXH0AE|4.0|Damn Hollywood and their need for happy endings. \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" was a film that opened in 2006 to great reviews, had a lot of Oscar buzz surrounding it, and then audiences began responding to the film rather poorly (at least where I live...Everyone I know that has seen it, hates it) and so it disappeared. \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" is very original, well-written, well-acted, and very funny...Since it tells you what's going to happen at the end, I prayed that the writer wouldn't back out and change it. Then the ending happens and I found myself shaking my head disapprovingly. The ending is satisfying, nice to see...But, in my opinion, I would say this was one of the best films of the year...A nice break perhaps from a typical studio film, but I guess that's too much to ask for. Will Ferrell (once again blending nicely into a comedy-drama, following his scene stealing performance in \\"Winter Passing\\") plays Harold Crick, an IRS agent whose life is a seemingly endless circle of teeth brushing, working, and going to sleep. Harold has no life, no girlfriend, no friends, and his life is based around numbers. While the film never says it, Harold clearly has Obsessive Compulsive Disorder and counts his brush strokes, stairs, steps, and relies heavily on his wristwatch (which seems to have a personality of its own). Then, one day, a strange thing happens. Harold finds that a female is narrating his life and only he can hear it. We know (in an example of dramatic irony, hilariously noted by Dustin Hoffman) that the narrator is Karen Eiffel (Emma Thompson, who's terrific), a famous writer who hasn't published a novel in 10 years due to writer's block. Harold Crick is her main character and she's struggling with finding a way to kill him, so much so that her publishers have hired an assistant (Queen Latifah) to help her. Harold, fearing that he is crazy, suddenly begins taking the narrator seriously when she says that Harold will soon die. Fearing the worst, he consults aliterary professor (Dustin Hoffman, who steals every scene he's in) who tells Harold to find out whether his story is a comedy or tragedy. Things aren't looking good for Harold since the odds are against him...He works for the IRS, everybody hates him. When he tries to file an audit on Ana Pascal (Maggie Gyllenhaal), a baker, the whole bakery boos him. But then Ana begins to fall for Harold (surprisingly both Ferrell and Gyllenhaal have pretty good chemistry together) and things look up. Until a construction company almost demolishes his apartment, while he's inside watching TV Thompson's narration of the events is absolutely hilarious and Thompson's voice is so suited for the role. The movie has a great look to it and for a while I had a lot of hope for it. It kept heading in the direction of the non-stereotypical Hollywood comedy-drama, but opts out at the last second. I still enjoyed \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" quite a bit and, as I said, I did enjoy the ending and maybe the ending I was hoping for wouldn't have worked as good. All the actors are perfectly cast in their roles...Ferrell is doing a very good job at slowly easing his way into the drama category, Hoffman & Thompson are perfect, and Latifah & Gyllenhaal add a lot of nice moments to the film. I recommend \\"Stranger Than Fiction\\" it's certainly one of the best films of its kind from 2006 and has a lot more originality than those other films. <br /> <br />GRADE: B+
B000059TFO|5.0|This product was very informative and thought provoking.  I have viewed this film before, but as I viewed it with my daughter I was given an opportunity to teach as we watched.  I have never \\"to my knowledge\\" experienced many of the things that the film depicted, but I am a recipient of the many the blessings that the suffering of that time has produced.  The timing and issues of this film are still relevant today, but the faces may longer be found behind a mask.
B000001FDK|5.0|Given all the hype surrounding the upcoming revival of \\"Grease\\", I decided to pull out the smash #1 soundtrack version from 1978 and relisten to an album I played non-stop almost thirty years ago. <br /> <br />Sure the cast is a bit old for their respective characters, but John Travolta, Olivia Newton-John & Stoccard Channing were terrific.   <br /> <br />Based on the stage version from the early seventies, the soundtrack wisely included new songs written specifically for the screen version:  \\"Grease\\" (#1), \\"Hopelessly Devoted To You\\" (#3), \\"Sandy\\", and \\"You're The One That I Want\\" (#1).  The songs remain fun & fresh-sounding - even today. <br /> <br />Best tracks: <br /> <br />Grease <br />Summer Nights <br />Hopelessly Devoted To You <br />You're The One That I Want <br />Sandy <br />Beauty School Dropout <br />Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee <br />Greased Lightning <br />Born To Hand Jive <br />There Are Worse Things I Could Do <br />We Go Together <br /> <br />
1582701709|1.0|Larry King did an interview with one of the people instrumental in \\"The Secret\\" project. King asked him about people \\"attracting\\" consequences to themselves (through vibes or some such hocus pocus). King specifically asked the guy if Jessica Lundsford attracted her murderer. The Secret guy answered that each of us attracts our own outcomes and that there are NO exceptions. This is just plain upsetting and callous in view of what happened to that child. I will skip \\"The Secret. Bad \\"vibes.\\"

B000ION23A|3.0|Warner Brothers presents CG animation film \\"The Ant Bully\\" based on John Nickle's book of the same title, co-produced by Tom Hanks. The film also features the voices of Julia Roberts, Nicholas Cage, Meryl Streep, Paul Giamatti and Bruce Campbell. Few films can attract these talents and my expectation level was high by knowing these names, even though the new film's story unfolds against the background of a colony of ants - just like Dreamwork's \\"Antz\\" and Pixar's \\"A Bug's Life.\\"    I have finished watching the film and my impression is this: the film is OK, but nothing great and the current status of Pixar as trend-setting company will not change for the next few years. I am not saying \\"The Ant Bully\\" is bad. Its visual world, especially the images seen from an ant's perspective, is impressive and its \\"Star Wars\\"-like battle scenes are both unique and exciting to see. Computer graphic technology has advanced more than we had expected back in 1998 when \\"A Bug's Life\\" was released.    But the same cannot be said about the script of the new film as \\"The Ant Bully\\" borrows so many elements from other films, animated or live-action. OK, \\"A Bug's Life\\" is virtually a remake of Kurosawa's \\"Seven Samurai,\\" but the details are totally different with originality. John A. Davis (\\"Jimmy Neutron: Boy Genius\\") keeps the ball rolling with the adventures of Lucas, a boy called \\"The Destroyer\\" by poor ants, because he demolishes the ant hills. Shrunken, the boy has to learn a lesson or two, but the messages come with mildly gross humor and certain amount of goo, without which, I believe, they could have made a great family-oriented film.     \\"The Ants Bully\\" is an amusing and entertaining family picture. I know this sounds like cliché, but the film is good, but not great.

B0006399FS|1.0|A long-time U2 fan. I saw them when I was a student when they were playing the Hammersmith Odeon in London. There are only two good tracks on this album. \\"Vertigo\\" and \\"Sometimes you can`t make it on your own\\", although the second is beginning to sound like a repetitive theme. Vertigo is excellent, original sound and production, when I first heard it I loved it, not even knowing it was U2. Great energy. U2 should be embarassed about putting out such a mediocre album. Doesn`t anyone tell them, \\"hey.. that is not actually a good enough song to put out\\". I was in a band myself, sometimes a song was rubbish, and you just have to let it die. Not all babies are beautiful.
B000KX0IOK|5.0|Half Nelson is the best movie I've seen in the theaters all year. Complex and moving, it challenges the viewer to confront easy stereotypes. Ryan Gosling gives an amazing performance as Dan, a crack-addicted teacher in an inner city school in NYC. He states the kids keep him grounded, and I believe him. One of his students is Drey, played with heartbreaking somberness by Shareeka Epps. They start an uneasy friendship after she catches the teacher high one night at school. The relationship is one of opposing forces, as Dan lectures one day in his class: black and white, teacher and student, adult and child. But there is far more ambiguity explored here, which I love to see in films. It's not the traditional white teacher saves the poor minority students tale we've seen before.<br /><br /> There are so many scenes that the movie gets just right. When Drey finds her teacher high the first time, it's almost painful to see Gosling's reaction. And when Dan goes home for a family dinner, you can see exactly where the addiction was fostered. It's quite tragic. Director Ryan Fleck and co-screenwriter Anna Boden capture these moments with clarity and restraint.
B00018D44U|5.0|I love the music of Norah Jones and I love this CD.  She is so smooth.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Despite the fact it's almost unanimous that Sean Connery is everyone's favorite Bond, for some there's just the case of the era you happened to catch. Some are old enough to remember the Connery era while others were introduced to Bond thanks to Roger Moore. For me it was Pierce Brosnan in Goldeneye, which is still one of my favorite Bond films, that brought me into the 007 world. However, the series needed a serious revamp when it was filled with awful one-liners, over-the-top action scenes and a campiness that was hard to shake off. Taking a cue from the Batman restart, Casino Royale also restarts the series by showing not only a more serious agent, but a better approach. <br /> <br />Just getting his \\"00\\" status, James Bond is a bit arrogant and has a case for letting his ego letting the best of him. His mission is to stop the man, Le Chiffre, a poker fanatic who helps finance world terrorists. Instead of blowing things up left and right, Bond instead goes into a high-stakes poker game and make Le Chiffre lose all his money and make him easier to apprehend. Sent to look after Bond and finance him in the poker game is Vesper Lynd, who Bond starts to fall for and drop his guard. He'll find the world of espionage a difficult life, especially when it comes to separating emotion from the mission. <br /> <br />First of all, I have 2 knocks against the film: I'm not the greatest fan of the theme song \\"You Know My Name\\", performed by Chris Cornell. Then again I didn't like the last 3 songs anyway but even though it fits with the darker atmosphere the film has, I just don't like it as a song. The other is the actual poker game itself: it's just too slow. It takes a good half an hour when it starts and when we find out the winner and while it does have some action in-between, he just feels like a good 15 minute scene stretched twice as long. It's not enough to completely knock the film down a point and it is important to the overall story, it just should've been better edited. <br /> <br />Now the big question: how's the new Bond? Like Christian Bale taking over the Dark Knight, Craig just seems like a perfect choice. While he's arguably the less pleasing Bond aesthetically, he's got that wit and charm that he should have, while also having that action hero we expect. He seems more intense and withdrawn than any of them have had. That isn't a knock against the more charming Connery, or the actor-y Timothy Dalton but Craig just has a more loose cannon feel he should've been all along. As for the action, it's quite exciting because it's grounded in reality. Outrunning a satellite beam in a car that can turn invisible just feels too silly while Bond hanging on for life on a speeding airport vehicle set to blow up is more exciting. Also the big opening set-piece, a physics-defying foot chase looks awesome but it also looks slightly comical since you keep thinking that guy should've broken his bones already. <br /> <br />Like the Departed, this is probably the skinniest \\"2 Disc special edition\\" I've ever seen. It's basically got 3 featurettes: a look at Daniel Craig's announcement and start as the new Bond, a surprisingly entertaining look at the Bond girls with Maryam D'Abo being our main host and a look at the stunts being more real rather than using CG. You can obviously tell that a bigger release is coming since there just seems to be a lot missing. A commentary would've been nice, or a breakdown of the action scenes; something, anything. But at least the stuff we have is interesting and worth a look but all of a sudden, it just stops and you feel there's more to explore. <br /> <br />Bet a lot of naysayers sure felt sheepish when this came out. More serious, brutal and just all around better, it's great to see Bond as the agent men wanted to be and women wanted to be with...and do.
B000LE1FAY|5.0|I must say that Belinda makes a definitive comeback with her new album, Voila. I was a little skeptical at first, about how this album may be (since it's sung entirely in french). I must say I was simply blown away when listening to, Voila. Belinda's voice sounds better than ever, and her french is simply hypnotic. I'm so excited for her and recommend this album to any Belinda Carlisle/Go-Go's fan.

0393307050|3.0|We loved the movie so we bought the book thinking it would be even better.  In this instance we were disapointed.  The writting style is excellent and engaging, but there is a bit more realism (sexualy) than I'd prefer.  This does not enter until about 1/2 way through the book and I was very disapointed when my concience demanded that I read no further.

This is a modern day classic giant bug movie that really pays homage to the good lo' days! Solid FX and good performances keep the tension high and the laughs in all the right places. This is the best the series of 4 films, but I like the 3 sequels too! The DVD transfer is excellent and there are some interestinf extras.

B000LXHK2C|4.0|Oui, this is a \\"feel-good\\" movie. Oui, the script has almost no surprises in it. Oui, Ridley Scott, Russell Crowe and the rest of the cast must have had a great time shooting this. <br /> <br />Still, this movie delivers exactly what i expected. It made me smile, it made me laugh (\\"Lance Armstrong !\\"). It is a touch short on drama. Bon, to be honest the drama bit is poorly handled.  <br /> <br />The actors are good and i did not feel i was making them a favour for paying to watch this movie. Ridley Scott delivers some nice views. Fair enough. <br /> <br />Relax, let the movie take you where you know it is going, and enjoy that simple pleasure. There are many movies out there with greater ambitions but that deliver far less.

B00007KWHG|3.0|In February we went to see Jersey Boys.  Instead of buying the CD at the show for a premium price I decided to wait and go through Amazon.  Good move except I should have bought the sound track from the Show, which was available through Amazon instead of this CD.  The sound quality of this CD is weak and somehow the songs themselves didn't have the same punch.  It's boring to my ears. I recently listened to the Sound Track from the show and was blown away.  If you are looking to recreate the Show sound, buy the show CD.
B00003CXCT|5.0|What can I say? George Lucas should've stopped at three. After seeing Episode III, I sold my copies of Episodes I & II. <br /> <br />Jar Jar Binks may have annoyed some Star Wars fans in Episode I but teen-aged Anakin stole that trophy in Episodes II & III. Couple that with Hayden Christensen's acting, and George's cheery 'reunion' ending on Episode VI, and I not only couldn't bring myself to buy Episode III but I sold Episodes I & II--and I've lowered my opinion of Episode VI. <br /> <br />Forget the rest. Buy the best.
B00006JDVV|3.0|I love the way that dragons are more realistically portrayed than in most fantasy films. No cute talking dragons in this. These are creatures simply being what they are. I found the twist on dragons being the cause of the extinction of the dinosaurs very original. The dragons themselves were exceptional works of art. <br /> <br />On the flip side, there was not enough dialogue. The story is terribly linear so you don't get to know the characters at all. Unless you can remain riveted to explosions and dragons alone, you find your mind wandering. The bad part about that is, even if your mind wanders, you don't miss anything. The whole movie is the same. <br /> <br />It's worth watching for the art and refreshing portrayl of dragons, but have a gameboy or something with you when you watch it. LOL
0439206472|5.0|This is the first of many books and a lot of drama.  Much of the reasoning behind the different problems and ideas is completely out there, but it is addicting nonetheless.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Too bad it didn't get to stay on the air. If only Sci-Fi channel would pick it up and do it justice. This set included some shows not aired. I am picky about the acting and writing of scifi shows and this show was one of the good ones. Sometimes i wish the captain showed a little more of his vulnerabilities. One of the outtake scenes did and it was great. Buy this set and enjoy something missing from TV. Didn't know but two of the actors when this first came on TV, but someone recognized some darn fine acting abilities and they were on the money! Some day we will once again get quality back on TV(i hope). Maybe with luck this will once again air.

B0007VCZ50|5.0|Music documentaries don't come much finer than Michael Apted's 1985 classic \\"Bring on the Night\\".  In the film, exquisitely photographed on 35 mm, Apted documents the rehearsals of Sting's then-newly-assembled backing band and ultimately their first concert.  It's a surprisingly fascinating and stunningly well-made, let alone highly insightful, look at the preparation that went into the performance as well as the dedication and skill of the band and their rather stiff leader.  The members are completely open about their feelings toward Sting and the band, as well as the direction in which it was headed; it is hailed as a work of genius, at once a anti-racial statement and a brilliant melding of intense jazz and intellectual rock.  And while it may be just that, it's Apted's delectable film that is the real work of genius here. <br /> <br />We see the astounding skill of the backing band members, Sting's dedication and controlled brilliance as well as his near humorlessness, which the band members (particularly a charmingly young Branford Marsalis!) are all-too-happy to mock.  We see that former Police manager and current Sting manager Miles Copeland (yes, Police drummer Stewart's bro) is actually something of a jerk, but a talented manager.  We feel the tension of opening night, and that is why Apted's film is so great.  Unlike the average documentary, we are not outsiders looking in at a little glass bubble and seeing the machinery work; we are there with the band, along for the ride.  We are amazed at the hard work of the band, and we too struggle against the pressure that the band fights.  We cannot wait to see the fruition of the group's efforts.  Apted makes us feel, and that is why \\"Bring on the Night\\" is such a masterpiece. <br /> <br />Of course, there's also the music.  The concert is fantastic, offering new compositions, a few blues and jazz covers, and some jazzed-up reinterpretations of former Police tunes.  Particularly wonderful is a dazzlingly soothing performance of \\"Fortress Around Your Heart\\", a sumptuous rendition of \\"I Burn for You\\" oozing sensuality, and a gleaming, utterly beautiful performance of \\"Message in a Bottle\\" featuring solely Sting on his guitar.  Another highlight is a memorable sequence in which, while Sting's bombastic, paranoid \\"Russians\\" plays in the background, Sting's wife Trudie Styler gives birth to their son. <br /> <br />\\"Bring on the Night\\"'s long-awaited DVD release is worth the wait.  The picture is simply gorgeous, and the DTS sound mix is fantastic, making you feel even more like you're present at Sting's first solo concert.  The DVD also includes three Sting music videos as well as the original trailer, radio spots, and the option to create a \\"personal playlist\\".  Over twenty years after its release, \\"Bring on the Night\\" remains one of the very best and most riveting music documentaries ever released, and this DVD is an essential purchase for Sting fans or any musically-inclined soul who wants to experience a masterpiece of documentary filmmaking.

B00000295Y|4.0|Cypress Hill's (B-Real, Sen Dog, & DJ Muggs) second album \\"Black Sunday\\" was an excellent album, from a Latin Hip Hop group based out of Los Angeles. If you haven't already figured out, Cypress Hill mostly rhymes about getting smoked out through out their career. And those rhymes are all over this album. That mixed with DJ Muggs production really makes the vibes in this album easy to catch. I believe \\"Insane In The Brain\\" was the lead single on this album, and it's a good song. B-Real handles most of the vocals through out the album. When I hear Sen Dog's voice and his ad-libs on here, he cracks me up because of how he sounds, but his rhymes are dope as well. Along with rhyming about smoking weed, they also rhyme about shooting people like \\"Hand On The Glock\\" (aka \\"Hands On The Pump Part II\\") and \\"Cock The Hammer\\". \\"When The Ship Goes Down\\" is another excellent track by B-Real with Sen Dog's background vocals. (I'm aware of the actual song title, but I placed the title in my review from the radio edit of the song.)<br /><br />As for flaws, the only thing is lack of subject matter. Not too often Cypress Hill detours from the topics of smoking weed and guns on this album (they even put facts about marijuana inside of the linear notes that are interesting). That is the only inferior about this album. It's an excellent album from 1993, a time when gangsta rap was in full swing. If you're a big time smoker, you'll probably relate to this easier than others. But if you want to hear some west coast tunes from the early-mid 90's, you'll probably like this album.<br /><br />Lyrics: B+<br /><br />Production: A-<br /><br />Guest Appearances: N/A<br /><br />Musical Vibes: A+<br /><br />Overall: A-<br /><br />My favorite tracks: I Ain't Going Out Like That, Insane In The Brain, When The Ship Goes Down, Cock The Hammer, Hits From The Bong, A To the K, Hand On The Glock<br /><br />Peace!

The story goes back to its roots....that the championship is in the journey, not winning the title itself.<br /><br />Rocky's now a widower, having lost Adrian to cancer, and has a shaky relationship with his son. He's living a quiet life in retirement, but still feels that he has something left to prove to himself. He gets his chance and another bout in the ring with Mason Dixon.<br /><br />Like the original Rocky, this time it's more about a spiritual journey than the sport. Some of us have come of age along with the series, and it's great to see Our Hero go back to his roots.

B000GFLKF8|4.0|Spike Lee has never been known for his subtlety.  He makes powerful films that are often smart (\\"Do the Right Thing\\"), occasionally not (\\"She Hate Me\\"), and sometimes brilliant (\\"Malcolm X,\\" \\"4 Little Girls\\"), but there is never any question that Spike's first goal is to make an emotionally powerful film.   <br /> <br />Lee departs drastically from past practice with \\"Inside Man,\\" a hyper-smart heist movie that adopts all the tricks of the genre.  While no \\"heist movie\\" is ever going to rise to the hallowed heights of \\"The Sting\\" in movie lore, Lee has made one heck of an enjoyable movie. <br /> <br />Clive Owen plays criminal ringleader Dalton Russell, and he tells the audience in the opening scene (shattering the fourth wall) that he has done a bank job, and here's how he did it.  In broad daylight, Russell leads a handful of thieves into the downtown Manhattan branch of a powerful bank, founded in 1948 by Arthur Case (Christopher Plummer).  Within moments, Russell has taken about forty hostages and has the bank surrounded by cops and media.  And yet he hasn't touched the money and seems hardly perturbed.  Why? <br /> <br />This question dogs lead detective Keith Frazier (Denzel Washington) and his sidekick, Bill Mitchell (Chiwetel Ejiofor).  It's clear that Frazier and Mitchell are used to being smarter than the criminals they face, but Russell is clearly in a different league. <br /> <br />Further muddying the waters is the appearance on the scene of Madeleine White (Jodie Foster) as a woman hired by Case to protect his interests in the bank . . . interests that are contained in security box 392.  Miss White (there's the trademark Lee subtlety at work) is the kind of person who gets to patronize the mayor of Manhattan and lord her power over mere mortals such as Detectives Frazier and Mitchell.  It's clear that Foster relishes this chance to play perhaps the biggest witch of her career, even if one wishes that Miss White were on screen a bit more.   <br /> <br />The heist proceeds through its paces with the typical cadence of move and countermove by police and criminal.  To summarize any more would be to give the game away, but like all great heist movies, \\"Inside Man\\" keeps you guessing right up until the very end.  The fact that upon reflection the whole story is completely ridiculous is beside the point - heist movies are more about style and wit than logic, and are at their best when one player is able to move among the others as if he or she has had an advance peek at the screenplay. <br /> <br />Lee generally eschews his trademark focus on racial issues, and the few scenes where these arise feel contrived and beside the point.  Fortunately, Lee never lets the movie get bogged down in these moments, and to his credit, spends about as much time with sexism as he does racism.   <br /> <br />But never fear - this is an intelligent heist movie made by a talented, dedicated filmmaker.  Solid work by the entire cast makes \\"Inside Man\\" a pleasure to watch - Mr. Lee and his team should be very proud, and it's not surprising that this movie has been Lee's biggest box office hit yet, and a sequel appears to be in the works.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|After STF, Will Ferrell can definitely act. This film absolutely caught me unaware. I'd go as far as saying this was one of the five best films of 2006. Maggie Gyllenhaal has something about her, something enough for me to have a crush on her. :) I thought the best thing about the film was the screenplay, direction and the music. The music was unwinding, freeing and stolid all at once. Cheerful, too. The film is about a man who's hearing voices as if his own life is being read out to him. The humor is outlandish and sometimes mundane but overall, it secures more than just a kill. The film is growing on me daily and it's only been a week since I saw it last. I loved the passion with which it was made (My other best films of the year include - Departed, Babel, Running Scared, Apocalypto, Thank you for smoking, Prestige, Little Miss Sunshine, Vendetta and Hard Candy. Stranger than fiction is a comfortable #5.)
0393327655|5.0|In addition to being socially relevent, immensely enertaining, and expertly written, \\"The End of Faith\\" is also compelling in its logical case against 'blind faith' in general. As Harris points out throughout the pages of this tour de force, religion is the only forum wherein it is perfectly acceptable for otherwise rational individuals to form beliefs about the nature of reality while offering no evidence whatsoever. Why is this so? Why is it considered a virtue by so many to hold (life-directing) beliefs that have no discernable basis for validity? I was once a christian, now I'm not. This was by no means a step down for me (morally speaking). I'm a better person now than ever I've been BECAUSE I now base my beliefs about the world (and about others) on tangible evidence. When you choose to be a christian, you are taking on beliefs about the nature of reality (with no evidence whatsoever, to be sure)......and you're also taking on beliefs about ME (as a non-believer) as well. In fact, as a christian, you must believe that all non-christians are enemies of God who will spend enternity in Hell (it's all in that 'divinely authored' text you hold as truth). Many of the Christians I know seem uncomfortable with attesting to this biblical 'truth.' Why dilute the Christian faith, rather than just abandoning it in all of its absurdity? Christianity is only currently seen as more rational than Islam because CHRISTIANITY HAS BEEN DILUTED OVER TIME (it's more extreme and dangerous teachings having been deemed worthy of marginalization by those who wish to keep the madness going). Today's Muslims are more extreme (and more dangerous) solely for being MORE DEVOUT.  <br /> <br />Read this book.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|As a novelist, I couldn't help but sit down for two hours with this movie. I've seen other \\"writer\\" flicks, ranging from \\"Finding Forrester\\" to \\"Author, Author.\\" Enjoyable, yes. Entertaining, sure. But not always thought-provoking, and certainly not accurate depictions of my own creative process. So, with low expectations, I popped in the DVD. The buzz surrounding the film had died, leaving me and Will Farrell and Emma Thompson to share a story together.<br /><br />The story is simple. A man named Harold Crick begins to hear a woman's voice in his head. She is narrating his life, with surprising accuracy. The woman is a novelist facing time pressure from her publisher. She has writer's block, unable to choose the appropriate demise for her main character, also named Harold Crick. The fictional and real-life characters are one and the same, sharing the fate decided by the writer.<br /><br />From the creative opening sequences, to the slow unveiling of Farrell's character, to the difficult final decision of Thompson's novelist, \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" never gets off track. Each time the pacing seems it may flag, another element or payoff reengages the viewer. Thompson plays one of her best roles in years. Gyllenhaal, Queen Latifah, and Hoffman add their stellar acting to the mix. In contrast to the higher-grossing \\"Talledega Nights,\\" Farrell proves he can be a riveting screen presence even when subdued.<br /><br />Funny, warm, and life-affirming, \\"Stranger than Fiction\\" explores the world in an unconventional way. By the end, we feel so comfortable here that it seems almost, well, conventional. Almost the way it should be. On the part of the writer, director, and cast, that's the mark of a job well done.
B000MNP2KI|1.0|this is not much of bond movie, if you would ask me. I love daniel criag as a actor, but I do not see him as bond. I could not watch this movie could only watch about 15 mintues of it to date. Bring back old bond not this none playful one we know and love.
B00005K3NY|4.0|Scanners is the story of a scanner (one who has telekinetic abilities such as blowing others' heads off) by the name of Cameron Vale (Stephen Lack) whom doctor Paul Ruth (Patrick McGoohan) enlists to help him seek out an evil scanner, Darryl Revok (Michael Ironside), who wants to lead his own army of psychotic scanners to world domination.<br /><br />This was the film that put David Cronenberg on the map. It's one of his best and 25 years later, it still works; it actually fits this millennium like a glove, with all the experiments going on in science these days. As with all of Cronenberg's movies, he explores multiple themes and the film has more depth than it appears to have at first glance. It's a great blend of sci-fi and horror, at times unsettling, and features awesome special effects (the exploding head at the beginning, the final confrontation between Vale and Revok) and leads to a powerful climax. On the downside, the acting is a bit stiff and uninspired by the majority of the cast (save for Ironside who oozes evil in this role as in all his other roles).<br /><br />If you're a fan of Cronenberg, what are you waiting for? You should have seen this already! If you like horror and/or sci-fi films, this one's a real treat. It's got a great plot, suspense, cool action scenes and Cronenberg's unique vision. See it today before the remake comes out next year!

1577314808|4.0|I actually haven't finished this book yet but am so impressed that I am willing to write a review now. Living in the Now seems so obvious but Tolle enlighted me to the fact that I wasn't doing what I thought I was doing. And like anything worth doing, living in the Now takes practice. I highly recommend this book. It is a great springboard for taking control of your life.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|absolutely, undeniably, one of the greatest shows that has ever aired on network television, and my personal favorite dramatic television show ever. It's perhaps a bit daunting to both camps, those who like sci-fi, and those who don't, because although it looks sci-fi (flying space ships, and what not), that's really not what it is, at it's heart. All of Josh Whedon's shows have been about creating and finding family, and focused strongly on character development, and this series has both in spades. Whedon writes dialog with such effortless flair, and he is a master of never letting the viewer get bored...or comfortable. The good always has a little bad mixed up in it, and the really bad moments always seem to be hilighted with a bit of black humor (one of the absolute funniest moments in the series occurs early in I believe the pilot when Mal tells Simon that Kaylee is dead, and she's not...watch and see). This is much how life IS though, it's never simple, and if you are bothered by such things then go back to watching your ABC sitcoms. The \\"western\\" elements that are often advertised come in in the form of the rim planets, where conditions are poor, and many people live in poverty. Hardly a episode passes where you don't see someone riding a horse. But it all fits, and feels very natural. Regardless of how advanced technology and society gets, there will always be those on the outside of it.<br /><br />The characters themselves are magnificently crafted, none more so than Mal, the reluctant protagonist. He fought against the Alliance (think Star Wars' Empire, but with far less sinister overtones) and lost, and is now something of an outlaw, and takes pirating jobs with his crew to scrape out an existence. What Serenity (the name of his ship) is to him, is a sense of freedom, and a family. The absolute greatest moments in the series come when this is felt strongly. When the crew is sitting around the table eating dinner together, when they are on a backwater planet singing and dancing and drinking with the locals (and Mal ends up getting married...); the show is without peer in its ability to create a sense of camaraderie, and truly, of family. In instilling the belief in you that no matter how big the galaxy may be, as long as you have someone next to you,  its always managable.<br /><br />The show is intriguing, poignant, hilarious (if you don't laugh during Jaynestown, you might in fact be a robot), and absolutely a MUST see. Watch the pilot immediately, and welcome to the ranks of the browncoats.<br /><br />VERY highly recommendedanet singing and dancing and drinking with the locals (and Mal ends up getting married...); the show is without peer in its ability to create a sense of camaraderie, and truly, of family.

B0009R1T7M|5.0|The (asthmatic) cat's p.j.'s!  Stevens' music is an eclectic mix of rock, bluegrass, minamilism, and who knows what.  Having grown up in Illinois, the songs really resonated for me.  A tender ballad about a serial killer?  Whoa! Sufjan is promising to an album on each of the 50 states; I can't wait for him to get to Missouri!
B000B5XZLU|5.0|Jamiroquai propels their tunes with a contagious rhytmic section of bass & drums, plus a jazzy piano, swinging pop lyrics, some tasteful guitar work and on top of that a great excuse for hitting the dance floor or at least tap a beat with your feet or hands. Excellent !
B00000I5Y6|3.0|If you have nothing by Kansas and want ONLY the hits, this is the one to get. (If you have some familiarity with their albums, drop a few extra bucks and get The Ultimate Kansas). The biggest hits are here, but the album cuts are suspect; not representing the best of their material. Hopefully you like some of them. They certainly do not suck, but could easily be replaced by some stronger choices. <br /> <br />Kansas is my favorite band and I would like to see them displayed in their best light. This would be my line-up for a single cd Best Of Kansas:
B000MGUZM0|3.0|I must say that i loved funeral and if you did too then i suggest you don't pick up this album. <br /> <br />This album is nothing like their previous. Somewhere between this album and the last they stripped away the wall of sound, the beautiful intertwined female chorus, thumping bass lines, and tearful vocals. Anyone who likes Neon Bible must use the word \\"maturity\\" because Neon Bible is devoid of anything energetic or playful. <br /> <br />Somebody has to shake you guys out of your blind love for this band. I don't expect the follow up of a great album like funeral to be just as good (good thing i didn't) and you shouldn't either. Yes, the lyrics are political and have more gravity than the previous album but it makes for a boring sound. I suggest sticking to jim croce, i also hear bob dylan writes good stuff. <br /> <br />i generously gave this a 3 star because i didnt want to devalue the use of a 1 star. that should be reserved for Fall Out Boy and maybe Arcade Fire's next album. <br /> <br />FYI: Pitchfork Media voted their first album funeral #1 the same year that they voted Britney Spear's Single Toxic the most underrated song.
0743298020|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.  And I just adore it when a literature professor  writes a first book and its a big hit (a la Dan Brown). <br />I have truly not enjoyed a book this much since \\"Shadow of the wind\\".  The author weaves us into her web and tales.  What true lover of literature doesn't love a story about a storyteller.  As a fan of all 19th century literature I applaud Setterfield - this book is truly an homage to the Bronte  Sisters, to Henry James, to Austen, to Wharton, to Dickens, and to Du Marnier, yet in a totally original manner.  Brava!
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I am usually not a fan of Will Ferrel's movies (the exception being Anchorman), but I found this to be an incredibly brave departure for him. The storyline is intriguing, and the love story feels natural and unforced unlike a lot of movies these days. Stranger Than Fiction is amazing, anything less than five stars would be a crime.

0553213105|5.0|I have wanted to read this book for years, like many people, I've watched the A&E movie, and have always been in love with Miss Bennett and Mr Darcy's story.  I was held back so long from reading it because I was afraid (or perhaps more convinced than afraid) that because of how long ago this book was written, the language would be so difficult to read and comprehend, that I would find little pleasure in reading it.  However, I was very mistaken!  I was pleasantly surprised as I began to read this book at how smooth is reads while still retaining the magical way of conversation of that period.  I loved it!  I recommend anyone who has the same reservations as I had about reading Pride & Prejudice to not worry, it reads beautifully!<br /><br />After reading the book, I can really appreciate how true to character and events the A&E movie kept, but no movie could ever compare!  I'm impatient to read more Jane Austen novels, and only wish that I had done so sooner!
B00000JXAK|4.0|This is very much like early Fairport Convention, only a little more amateurish (Fairport were consumate pros, after all) and certainly more strange -- but in a good way. Pretty interesting stuff.
B000065V9Y|4.0|Thsi cd has it all, great songs like \\"Talk to me\\", \\"Washing in the water\\"and \\"Secret world\\".  Also, some great hits, beautifully arranged and composed, the kind your not tired of after few years, like \\"Blood of Eden\\", \\"Steam\\", Digging in the dirt\\" and \\"Kiss that frog\\" <br />Three songs, in my mind, are weaker, which are \\"Love to be love\\", \\"Only us\\" and \\"Fourteen black painting\\" I give it a four star rating, highly recommanded.

B000000OQF|5.0|I am a 21 year old college senior.  I grew up in the era of nu-metal, and mainstream hip hop.  However, this is not my cup of tea.  Back in 1997 at the tender age of eleven years old, I turned on VH1 (which still played music videos from time to time) and came across a song that changed my life forever.  The song?  None other than \\"Welcome To The Jungle\\" by Guns N' Roses!!    Words truly cannot express how much that song changed me.  I went from a kid who was a fan of Limp Bizkit, Korn, and yes, the rap of the time, to becoming forever immursed in 80's metal!  It was in-part due to \\"Guns\\" that my musical interests have expanded to where they are today.    Thus, we are here to review what I believe is the best debut album of all-time!  That's right I said, THE BEST and I firmly stand behind those words.  When \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" hit the world, there was no telling just how far \\"Guns\\" would go in such a short amount of time.  I will say right here and now, if you like metal, or hard rock of any sort, than \\"Appetite For Destruction\\" is a MUST to own!    1. Welcome To The Jungle -  The song that started it all (both for the band, and me).  This song is quite possibly the best rocker of all-time!  Killer guitar work by Slash, amazing, powerful vocals by Axl, the rest is history.  It is also THE BEST song to open a concert.  When I saw them in Worcestor back in 2006, they opened with this song and blew me away!!  Amazing! 5/5    2. It's So Easy -  One of the weaker songs on the album, if you could even consider this weak.  I appreciate it more having heard it live, but I can say other than the hard-hitting guitar work, this is perhaps one song by Guns that never really kept my attention.  Still fits the album, and pretty good placement overall. 3.5/5    3. Nightrain -  Amazing song.  Where \\"Easy\\" may let you down, \\"Nightrain\\" picks you right back up.  Awesome vocals, and guitar work that hits you so hard you'll be on the floor!  Powerful drums that just brings everything together!  This song begins to show the true partying side of Guns N' Roses! 4/5    4. Out Ta Get Me -  Again, \\"Guns\\" back a punch with this tune.  The vocals are truly top notch, and the drums and bass harmonize so well on this track that you'll be pumping your fist and not even realize it!  Hard-hitting mayhem that never stops rocking! 5/5    5. Mr. Brownstone -  This song again is designed to show the partying lifestyle that GnR lives!  However there is a little underlying message to it as well.  a song about addiction and how, if they don't stop, the band could be over sooner than it began.  Hmm...any predictions people?  One of the best songs ever by the band with a good message in a truly rockin' way!  5/5    6. Paradise City -  Ah, the anthem!  Perhaps the best song \\"Guns\\" is known for.  What can I say about this song that hasn't been said?  It truly is a masterpiece and one of the best rockers of all-time!  A killer way to end a concert too!!  5/5    7. My Michelle -  This song believe it or not took me awhile to get into.  When I saw it done live as a duet with Sebastian Bach, it brought new meaning to it.  There is a sort of dark, depressing feel about this song as it seems that what is being said is true!  May take some time, but it truly is a rocker that suits this album well. 4/5    8. Think About You -  This song is rocking.  No lie, this song rocks, but it also may become repetitive to you after a few listens as well.  The guitar work is very, very solid and that might be what truly saves this track.  The vocals (while strong) seem a bit forced in parts, which creates a sense of shoddy production.  Seems as though this track was one that JUST made the final cut.  Very solid overall, but not the best. 4/5    9. Sweet Child O' Mine -  The ballad.  Every 80's band had to have at least one ballad on each of their albums, to play towards the female fans, and thus boost record sales even more!  The difference between this and most other ballads?  This one still rocks!  One of the strongest vocal performences by Axl, and an awesome intro to begin it all! 5/5    10. You're Crazy -  Another, pure, straight-up rocker!  I remember when i first heard this song acoustically and in the end it made this version so much more rocking.  After hearing, you may turn to your significant other and just shout....YOU'RE CRAZY!!!  4.5/5    11. Anything Goes -  Another ode to the lifestyle of \\"Guns!\\"  Also, another pure rocker.  The guitar is so solid on this track it may send shivers down your spine!  A perfect track, and perhaps an under-rated gem from the band! 5/5    12 Rocket Queen -  The best way to end a debut album!  Well, if your band's name is \\"Guns N' Roses\\" that is!  Complete with strong vocals, killer guitar, slick bass, and top notch drumming..throw in some overtly sexual noises and you have Rocket Queen!!  Awesome song that sadly did not get represented at the concert!  5/5    There you have it, perhaps the best hard-rocking debut album, EVER!  As i said, this is a MUST OWN for any fans of the 1980's and/or hard rock, and metal!  Truly a piece of history that deserves to be perserved for years to come!
B000IFQLSW|5.0|Concept That for me is unique actually. Kenny Wayne made a trip of 10 days in the US to meet and play with his idols (B. B. King, Clarence \\"Gatemouth\\" Brown, Hubert Sumlin, Pinetop Perkins, Henry Townsend, Honeyboy Edwards, Cootie Stark, Neal Pattman, and Etta Baker, Jerry \\"Boogie\\" McCain, Buddy Flett, Bryan Lee, John Dee Holeman, The Howlin' Wolf Band and thee Muddy Waters Band ).  This new release is a combo of CD/DVD. The CD is the soundtrack of the DVD Documentary. We found some compositions of the meeting bluesmen and for one time the CD is full !! 80 Minutes of pure good blues. There is a good mix between Acoustic and electric.    The DVD is very good but it's a documentary and not a DVD Live, Of course we can see some part of the performance but necessary complete except for the last day who was a Live show on a church with the Members of the Howling Wolf band and after with the members of the Muddy Water Band.    Partial proceeds of this project are being donated to Music Maker Relief Foundation    [...]
B000MTPANQ|5.0|This may be more convincing proof of his genius than any other single album in his career (and it's been quite a career). Simply stunning. This is why I listen to music.
B000000OPU|4.0|The very good tracks on this cd are \\"Red Rain\\" and \\"Mercy Street\\" <br />Great commercial success with \\"Sledgehammer\\", \\"Don't give up\\", \\"In your eyes\\" and \\"Big Time\\"..These four songs have been heard to often maybe, but still good occasionnaly to listen to. Two weak songs close the album, \\"We do what we're told\\" and \\"This is the picture\\", I go with four star for this album.

1594200823|5.0|A well written and researched book examining the food system we have with glimpses of what an alternative food system might look like. The farm that excites Mr. Pollan is Polyface Farms in Virginia- grass fed beef, free range chickens, happy pigs. Well... I grew up near Amish country and to me.... Polyface Farms sounds like an Amish farm. No alcohol, no caffeine, no TV, slaughter you own meats, be self sufficient. The thing is, Amish people have 5 or 6 kids to help work the farm and most families have a couple of those kids leave the Amish life for the attractions of American culture. Farm work is physically demanding and almost requires a vow of poverty. During my father's generation, farm boys all over the US were delighted to leave the farm and work in offices or factories. A mass return to self sustaining farms is not likely and would not be able to feed our big cities. Mr. Pollan's strongest point, and one should be the key focus of all concerned citizens, is that the whole industrial food system is based on cheap fossil fuels. Every input to industrial farming, from the fertilizers to the tractor fuel through the processing and marketing uses petroleum. The final cost for a calorie of food is more than 10 calories of fossil fuel. The major weakness of the book is the lack of discussion of the ethanol business and how the additional demand for corn as an ethanol input is exacerbating the trends discussed... burnout of the land, overuse of fertilizer, and non-sustainability. Likely Omnivore's Dilemma was written before the corn-ethanol nexus was so apparent. This is a great book which repays close reading.
1400032717|5.0|I'm in awe of the author's ability to get into the mind of this character. He revealed the plot the same way the character experienced it--bit by bit, at a very basic level--which resulted in evoking emotions I could never have otherwise experienced.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I enjoyed this album very much.  I had often thought about buying it, but kept putting it off.  I am really glad I finally bought it!
B00006AW2S|4.0|Out Of Our Heads began a new era for the Rolling Stones. The songwriting team of Jagger/Richards kicked into gear with the classics Satisfaction, The Last Time and Play With Fire. But this album is also loaded with great material such as Mercy Mercy, That's How Strong My Love Is, Good Times, The Under Assistant West Coast Promotion Man and The Spider and the Fly. It's also got good filler tracks like  Hitch Hike, Cry to Me,  One More Try and the noisy live track I'm All Right. Essential album for a Rolling Stones fan.
B000LXH0AE|5.0|I have to admit I was a bit tired when I watched this film the first time. Thought it was just Ok. However I watched it the next day on a full night's sleep and I just loved it. It is the very first movie that Will Ferrell has ever been funny in, normally you just have to settle for stupid when it comes to the roles he takes. Better yet he plays a serious role as an IRS auditor and just nails the role perfectly. Maggie Gyllenhaal co-stars as his love interest and their chemistry works well enough to carry this one way over the top. This movie has all the things that make movie watching great for me, excellent origional story, funny, and a nice amount of romance. If you want to be entertained in this way you will not be disappointed with this one.
0743298020|5.0|It has been quite a while since I have read a book that left me craving for more - not that this story is incomplete, I just didn't want it to end.  Although the story circles around death and dying, I found the author's words breathing life in every aspect she touched.  Her style of writing was very soothing to me and while there was a mystery abounding, I was never scared. <br /> <br />I see the two main characters on a journey:  Vita, coming to the end of her life, cleansing herself of the spirit she was and Margaret coming out of a self-imposed \\"death\\" stemming from the spirit she carried around and stepping into a new life. <br /> <br />I am making room on my favorite book shelf for this one nestled between Rebecca/Mrs.de Winter and Kane & Abel and a hop, skip and jump from Gone with the Wind, The Other Boleyn Girl, and The Widow of the South.
B000KCHZK6|5.0|In a world of crass commercialism and hype it's reassuring to know that there's someone out there with such undeniable talent and depth.  Norah Jones is the real thing.  Her music is so unpretentious and solid, through and through.
B000M5B6Q0|5.0|I watched the movie and immediately fell in love with its soundtrack, and couldn't wait to own the soundtrack CD. Unlike some other soundtrack CDs, this one contained all of the \\"vital\\" songs in the movie. Even though Hugh Grant is definitely not a great singer, I still love his voice and am so glad that someone else didn't sing his songs on this album. I think what really sells this CD is the songs by Haley Bennett (who played \\"Cora\\" in the film). Her artistic style is fantastic, and \\"Buddah's Delight\\" sort of reminds me of Britney Spears' third album. Haley's voice overpowered Hugh's on \\"Way Back to Love\\" but it was still delightful. Finally, \\"Pop!Goes my Heart\\" really took me back to the '80s and quite funny. Get this CD--it will surely entertain you!
B0000009OP|5.0|This is a very impressive album!  The 5 string bass with the sax is really a cool mix.  A definite must have for anyone. <br /> <br />
068484267X|5.0|Angela's Ashes gives you a deep and haunting look into the author as a child and shows how he perceived his habitus. It is a story in which it seems the only medicine for the suffering is to be found in the giving and taking of lashings of wit. The wit seems be the coping mechanism. Angela's Ashes may give you a glimpse into an Irish soul. If you are Irish and are of the same generation as the author it could possibly make you feel young again. The past is ever present in this fantastic book.

B000MTPANQ|5.0|I spent most of the 70's listening to Neil Young, and I'm pretty sure that if I had been able to listen to this record, it would have been one of my favorites. <br /> <br />Neil's voice has never sounded better -- it's very strong and clear -- and the simple solo arrangements are very strong.  And there are several songs on this CD that I like better than the canonical versions on the studio records. <br /> <br />The experience of listening to this has been really odd for me.  There are songs on here that have been part of my life for 30 years, and I think that some of these versions are better.  And it's not that there's a new or different take on them -- it's that same original vision, the thing that grabbed me at first, coming through stronger. <br /> <br />Basically, this is one of the best records of the 70's, inexplicably released in 2007.  Go figure.
074356619X|5.0|I have seen the dvd of the secret and I loved every person on it! then I got the cd's and they are so very powerful,it would be hard to imagine anyone who listens to these 4 cd's not experiencing life changing results!!
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I loved Daniel Craig as Bond. I was a little skeptical at first when I heard he was going to play Bond, but he really pulled it off. The story could have been better. It missed a little more of that secret agent feel. At the end of the movie I just wanted more. The over all Bond image is preserved. I cant wait for the next one. A must own for any true Bond fan.
B000AL730O|5.0|i like it more now than when i first bought it. this album grows on you and has some wonderfully beatlesque moments. all naysayers bite your tongue, and buy yourself a copy of this album as well as flaming pie, another great late-period mccartney album. one of my all time favorite solo mccartney songs, waiting for your friends to go, is on this album
159562015X|4.0|This book was easy to use and it had some insightful information. I spoke to others who took the test and we all agreed that at least 1 of our top 5 was not a strength of ours. It confirmed the same results I had with the  Myers/Briggs test. So I would say that it is pretty accurate.
B00003CWL6|1.0|Sorry to say, but only the squares would find anything deep or revelatory in this movie, and that is a lot of you reading this, you poor, pasteurized processed cheese products of human beings. You people haven't already realised all the messages in this film by yourselves? Well, maybe something good will come of this film, for that.   This is basically an exploitation film done in A movie production style. In my opinion, the only merit this film has is that the pot-using boyfriend with the camera was not portrayed as an unintelligent lazy slacker. Everything else was completely laughable and ridiculous. The event that stands out in my mind is when the camera guy's military-dad is standing in his yard and watching as Kevin Spacey signals, in plain view, for camera guy to call him so they can meet for another financial transaction - Oh COME ON!   The fact that American Beauty (title of a Greatful Dead album) was so widely praised and acknowledged in the way that it was by so many people both terrifies me and gives me hope. Maybe you people are starting to catch up.  lllllllllllllllllllllll
1596680199|5.0|This book is far and away one of the best polymer clay books out there!  The steps are clear and beautifully photographed.  All the techniques, (and there are close to all of them in this book,) to make the beads can easily be applied to any other project.  But the finished pieces, oh the finished pieces, are perfect for this book.  Each one simple, beautifully finished, elegantly put together, thoughtfully arranged.  If you are new to clay, BUY THIS BOOK!!! It will be an invaluable resource for you.  If you have more experience, BUY THIS BOOK!!!!  It will remind you how to hone your skills and give you beautiful work to be inspired by.  Excellent job Carol Blackburn!
B000KC86F4|1.0|No matter how much you spend on special effects or getting big name actors, that does not make a movie good.  X3 is the classic example of this.  Where did it go wrong?  The plot.  My gripes are listed at the end just in case you haven't seen the movie. <br /> <br />In short, this movie had the feel of guys in suits tampering with what they ought not, again.  And it stretched believability beyond a point that James Bond movies wouldn't even cross.  And Bond movies had some very far fetched things.  How hard is it to follow a proven storyline?  Specifically, the one in the comic books. <br /> <br />What are my gripes?  Superheroes and supervillains should never lose their powers.  Key heroes should never die.  In short, Professor X or Cyclops should have never died (even though the movie suggests Professor X didn't really die).  Magneto should never have lost his power.  The Phoenix was relegated to a minor character until the director decided they needed to spend up all of the special effects budget. <br /> <br />Finally, this movie is on Blu-Ray.  Blu-Ray is fine, but inferior to HD DVD except for storage space which is irrelevant thanks to Microsoft's VC-1 codec.  HD quality movies in VC-1 can fit on a standard DVD if you have no extras.  Blu-Ray doesn't support picture-in-picture like HD DVD.  Not all Blu-Ray player players support interactive features.  I'm not bashing Blu-Ray, because it is very good.  I'm just saying that HD DVD is better.  And I wish all the major studios would support both formats.
0895260131|1.0|Imagine a summary of Christianity based on<br /><br />-the Crusades<br /><br />-the Inquisition<br /><br />-some out-of-context quotes from the Bible<br /><br />-a few comments by \\"Christians\\" who's beliefs are not similar to the vast majority of Christians<br /><br />-David Koresh<br /><br />This should give a pretty good idea of how balanced and well-informed the author's view of Islam is.<br /><br />What this book 'reveals' is not Islam as practiced by the vast majority of Muslims. It is 'Islam' as the Other, the fever-dream of those more occupied with their own minds' demons than the reality of the 1.5 billion almost-exclusively-peaceful Muslims
B000007WNN|5.0|The Cult are cool and the best rock band from the 80's. Rick Rubin is the best producer in the biz. If my band,UGLYHEAD,wanted to pick a big time producer,Rick would be it! Ian is a great lead man and Billy Duffy is a great gutiar player!!!!!!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|This is my second copy of this CD, since I had already trashed the first one with over-use in my car.  <br />I remember reading a Rolling Stone interview with Mayer before the CD came out that he was concerned that it wasn't going to be as chart topping, and therefore, not as popular as his previous music. He thought he was going to be a wash-up.  HA HA HA. He WON a Grammy for this one, too. And my favorite song, \\"Heart of Love\\" will never get airplay, but I swear is the best. EVER. <br />I dunno. If you like John Mayer already, I'm preaching to the choir. If you don't know him, he's basically mellow, and his poetry is not to be missed. His guitar playing is amazing, although this album doesn't show any flashiness. I'm a huuuge fan. And as a professional musician myself, I reserve that status for very few.
0060594896|5.0|I love this book. It is easy to read and gives real practical tips for improving every area of your life. I am so inspired I even started a Success Principles group on Yahoo groups! SPAW (Success Principles for Awesome Women). Finally I'm getting the information I've needed to succeed in life. I really feel like I'm in motion now. Thanks Jack!
B000MRA5NS|5.0|The video quality of the Casino Royale movie transfer is literally jaw dropping! Picture all the times you've watched Discovery HD in 1080i (if you have seen this channel in HD, it's one of the top high definition channels) and then picture the entire movie with the same amount of clarity. The movie jets Bond all over the world and the slow plot development allows the audience to soak in the beauty of countrysides and cities (both in the day and at night). The writing in this movie is witty at times which is a fresh departure from the previous Bond movies. Yes, there are still a lot of beautiful women, fast cars, and product placement. For the first time in a long time, the plot has meaningful character development. The sound in the movie was also excellent though there were times I thought the bass overpowered the audio track (this could have been my surround sound settings). <br /> <br />Unfortunately, there are black bars due to the movie being presented in its original aspect ratio.  But the video and sound quality more than make up for this minor issue.  I only have a 1080i 46\\" Sony so I can only imagine what this movie looks like in 1080p.  Portions of the review above were taken from my personal blog.
B00006IK1C|5.0|Somewhere between Iron Maiden's two albums, Seventh Son of a Seventh Son and No Prayer for the Dying, Mr. Bruce Dickinson took a little time out and did a solo album.  I first came across the original CD while stationed in Germany in the early 90's (it broke due to theft,...thankfully this one came out) and after watching the tape that went along with this (Dive! Dive! Live!....again thankfully it is now on the DVD collection).  In my opinion....pure rock fun.  The only 2 tracks that I wasn't fond of was Son of a Gun and No Lies.  Everything else in between is just great listening material.  So boys and girls....if you are a fan of Iron Maiden and wanting to take a different stroll down Musical Lane....get this copy.  You won't regret it.  And while you're at it....get the compelation DVD as well.  Both are enjoyable. <br /> <br /> <br />UP THE IRONS!!!!!
B000K7VHQ4|4.0|Edward Norton has a habit of acting in movies with twists and turns.  This latest flick from 2006 is no exception, and is probably his best role yet.  Here, he plays the stage magician Eisenheim, a subtle, humble yet cunning artist who encounters his childhood love, Sophie, one evening at a public performance.  Straight away he strives to regain her love and steal her away from the future prince of Austria.  The prince however, is no pushover and has the local police chief in his pocket.  Eisenheim and Sophie concoct a plan that lets them escape, but which also leads to the suicide of the prince.<br /><br />The movie is set in Austria at the beginning of the 20th century.  The story is told in a roundabout way, beginning near the end, going back to the Eisenheim's childhood, and progressing to the climax.  Along the way we see a lot of surprises, including many good magic tricks, even by 21st century standards.  We also see how the calm and cool demeanor of the magician prevails over the haughty and sometimes pushy attitude of the Prince.  The DVD does not come with much extra features; no extra or deleted scenes, no alternate endings, and short interviews.
B000M341QE|5.0|this movie was on the edge of your seat movie and you never know how the bad guys are.
B00020HEL6|5.0|It's hard to believe that she can sing so soulfully and sensually at such a young age.  What will her voice be like in her 20's and beyond?  I hope Renee continues to make music.  I love listening to her.
B000F4MLZ8|4.0|This CD is great for cold october mornings while getting ready for the day, sipping a coffe and window-gazing. The lyrical content is unique and well delivered and I found the instrumentation to be moving. <br />Anyone who likes REALLY soft music and isn't bored by an album that tends to flow between tracks almost like one long song should pick this one up! You'll be glad you did.
B000H305U0|4.0|I really like the beats on this CD.  There were a few songs I could have done without, but other than that, I love the CD.
B00005N6KG|5.0|The MDR-W08L headphones are an excellent replacement for 'earbuds'. They are adjustable to fit any head size. They stay on, even during workouts. They are of an unobtrusive size. They are light weight and they have the 'right' wire length. Their 'highs' and 'midrange' are clear and clean. Their 'bass' is a little weak, but the bass is still audible (comparable to 'earbuds')(the bass is physically inherent because of their 3.5mm diameter driver). If you want 'bass' at a nice price of ~$15 pick up a package of COBY CVH56CIR headphones (2 in a Pack!) that have a 40mm driver that really 'puts-out' the bass. I love my SONY MDR-W08L headphones and I now have two pairs of them. (One pair for at work and one pair for at home).
B0002SVW3O|3.0|The sound is cleary different from their other CDs, but it is still obviously Sigur Rós.  It's pretty atmospheric, with some intense sound and voice effects.   <br />There's not too much to say about it. <br />I won't say it's necessary to own this CD if you consider yourself a Sigur Rós fan, but if you feel the need to own all of their albums, go ahead and make a purchase: you probably won't be too disappointed.
B00003W8NM|5.0|brand new, not a hair scratch on the disks. saved about 20 dollars from Movie Stop or Target. it got to me in about 2 weeks.
B0002W18MU|3.0|great song - the rest of the album is a bit slow and boring
B000H0MKGK|5.0|John Mayer has now created an album that stands at the very top of his already impressive catalog.  'In Repair' is one of the coolest songs you'll ever hear.  There's great guitar work, excellent songwriting, and it's a lot of fun to listen to.  What more could you ask?
B00006JKOM|5.0|Many folks have been thrown off scent by the cartoon and movie stuff, and not appreciated this album for what it is. It's got some really terrific songs on here that I never tire of hearing. \\"The Chequered Flag\\" at the end of the original album is triumphant, like Ian's vision of himself as an old man, looking back at the successes of his life and facing death without fear or regret.    Ian Anderson loved to toss red herrings and play games with his listeners -- don't be a sucker and think there is anything haphazard or lightweight about this album.    Well, I will admit \\"Quiz Kid\\" stinks. ;)
0743496728|5.0|These are the words that seventeen-year-old Peter Houghton says when he is found after a school shooting spree huddling with a gun in his hand by Detective Patrick Ducharme.  An outcast who had been bullied since kindergarten, Peter kills ten, including a teacher, and injures many more. <br />At first glance, it looks like a straightforward act of revenge, but things are revealed to be more complex.  One of his victims is Matt Royston, the boyfriend of his former childhood friend, Josie Cormier, and others are members of the in-crowd, but others have seemingly no relation.  In the days before the trial, and in the days leading up to the shooting, we are given the backstory, told mostly from Josie's, Peter's, and their mothers' viewpoint.  We learn of the incessant teasing this boy received, adults' unsuccessful attempts to help him fit in, and of the stormy relationship between Josie and Matt. During the trial, we hear from the victims who survived and the devastation the crime has wrought on their lives.  In the end, the reader may still be undecided whether Peter is primarily a victim, perpetrator, loyal friend, or all three, but that is the point. <br /> <br />What this book has that others like it often don't is compassion not just for the bullying victims, but for the \\"in-crowd\\" as well.  It is more complex than \\"We Need to Talk About Kevin\\" because Peter is capable of love and not just a run-of-the-mill sociopath. The end is a little odd, but not as jolting as the one in \\"My Sister's Keeper.\\" Highly recommended. <br /> <br /> <br />
B00000AOUD|5.0|In my opinion, this album sums up all the best of Jethro Tull -- great music, and those profoundly meaningful yet fantastically enigmatic lyrics. All the standard Anderson themes are included -- religious foolishness, individuality, the friction with his father. I love it!
0767812387|4.0|I was impress with Venessa Williams,that lady can dance.The movie was great and I like Chayanne.The movie was fast pace and the story line was great.
B00070DK14|4.0|The core songs of this album are quite good. I didn't have very high expectations for a Tull album from this period (I don't care for \\"Songs from the Wood\\") but as soon as I started reading the lyrics booklet I thought maybe this would be good. It was. \\"Beastie,\\" \\"Clasp,\\" \\"Slow Marching Band\\" and \\"Broadsword\\" really make the album. I really like \\"Slow Marching Band\\" -- it's beautiful.
B000HBK3MM|4.0|I love This CD.  I get the same good feeling listening to it as I did when first hearing India Arie. <br /> <br />The song writing is good.  However, there is room for growth.  She is in her early 20s though which implies that she only needs to live a little longer. <br /> <br />If you're looking for good music on the Neo Soul tip, this is the CD to get.  I've enjoyed it very much. <br />
B00070DK1E|2.0|I don't really care much for this album. Ian's voice here reminds me of a dried-up, raspy piece of rawhide. Maybe not necessarily a bad thing, but sad to hear compared to what it once was. The songs are not too great anyway. \\"Steel Monkey\\" is about the worst, in my opinion. The overall sound is maybe not so bad, if only I was born to some other language. The lyrics seem so sophomoric that I feel embarrassed when I listen to it, even while alone. \\"Budapest\\" is supposed to be really great -- Ian himself seems to regard it especially highly -- but it did not appeal to me at all. Kind of weird, I thought, and as a Tull fan I'm used to a bit of weirdness. \\"She Said She Was a Dancer\\" is better, in my opinion. \\"Mountain Men\\" was the one song on here I really did like. It would stand as a decent song on any Tull album. <br /> <br />Well, there are lots of better Tull albums to spend your money on first.
B0000A118M|4.0|A HUGE FAN OF JOHN COLTRANE AND ALL HIS WORKS. MY ONLY PET PEEVE IS THIS ALBUM ISN'T AS LENGHTY AS I WANTED IT TO BE.
B00000GAIW|5.0|No doubt about it, there are lots of wonderful songs on this famous album. It's an important entrance point to Tull music for many people, as it was for me. <br /> <br />But the title track... It's great to listen to, but I think wound up on this album by nefarious means and serves as a gross misrepresentation of what Jethro Tull is really all about.
B000002AHC|5.0|THis is the sound of the Byrds imploding while at the same time throwing everything but the kitchen sink into the mix. Hints of their eventual country turn sit inside burbling moogs and mellotrons- (Yes spacey keyboards)- backwards phrasing- flanged guitars and vocals - swirling inside the classic Byrds sound. The guitars still chime but this is very much a pyschedelic and one of the most unique i might add records from the era. Dont be fooled by the negative reviews this is right up there with piper-sgts peppers-( beatlesque horns at times) and for my money it may not be the best Byrds record(though i think it is)most interesting and rewarding listen. It also doesnt sound as dated as most pyschedelia. SOme of the bonus material is good (triad a crosby penned tune is very good and should have made the album originally). Crosby was booted during the recording but despite the problems internally this is a stunning album. And for the price you cant beat it.
B00008G9JO|4.0|Not liking \\"Songs From the Wood,\\" I bought this album along with \\"Broadsword and the Beast\\" -- with low expectations. While \\"Broadsword and the Beast\\" appealed to me just from reading the lyrics, at first I had no interest in this one. But within a week or so it started to grow on me, and now I (sometimes) think it might be better than \\"B&B.\\" <br /> <br />The lively \\"Acres Wild,\\" the beautiful \\"Moths,\\" and \\"Journeyman\\" are the best songs, in my opinion. \\"Rover\\" is also an interesting and for me somewhat poignant song, clearly not about a dog. <br /> <br />It was relief to know there was still some good Tull after \\"Too Old to Rock & Roll.\\"
B00004Y5A8|5.0|Contrary to the reviews here- i think disc One is the stunner here featuring many of Bowies earliest mod folk and acoustic rockers. God knows im good- (Brels) Amsterdamn -In the heat of the morning and well pretty much all of the first disc capture David at his early climb to fame. The interviews and radio chatter only enhance the uniqueness and rarity for fans. Its all very informative and captures a time and place and the sound is excellent- you can almost sense coming superstardom in the confidence of the material and in the band. Disc two contains most of his Ziggy Stardust material which ofcourse is all good but basically sounds like demos of that album and for the most part is very familiar even to the casual fan. The acoustic versions of Supermen and Andy Warhol would have sat better on disc one as they flow into that material better. This is a great bargain especially used nearly 40 songs of Bowie at his peak. Disc One however finds itself on permanent rotation in my cd player- i could listen to this all day.
B00005NTJK|5.0|Once you get past the initial appeal of the popular \\"Aqualung\\" and \\"Thick as a Brick,\\" and decide you want to study Tull music and lyrics more closely, this is the album to get. It is like a coded mission statement for the band, laying out the topics and themes that would reappear again and again in later albums. Particularly in the BEST Tull albums, not coincidentally. This one is like a window into the mind and motivations of Ian Anderson -- once you start looking through it instead of at it.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|If you are a fan of the Eagles this DVD is a must! <br />Excellent sound & content, all the hits.
B00008G9JN|2.0|This has got to be the least meaningful, and most frivolous, Tull album ever. Apparently Ian had grown tired philosophical jousting, and wanted to take a mental vacation in the country with his pants zipped none too tightly. <br /> <br />Thank goodness it wasn't a permanent retirement.
0375836675|5.0|OMG!!!  I cannot believe I was so into this book.  I mainly stay in the genres of boring, well what seems like boring now, fantasy novels.  But this book was maybe the only book that I finished contently and almost as if I was addicted to it in an unhealthy manner!  It makes all the other books I have ever read look like crap!   <br /> <br />I felt as if I was on this journey with Ed the whole time, and was intrigued and felt almost every feeling he felt.  I did however needed some time to get used to the slang and dialect of the book, because I am in the States and the book is based in Australia.   <br /> <br />And I agree with some of you who said the ending did not live up to the rest of the book, but it's still an amazing book!  It served its purpose though.  I just wish it was a little more elaborate and not so choppy and get-to-the-end-y. <br /> <br />Like I've mentioned before, I was actually able to finish the entire book totally captivated.  And that rarely happens for me.  It makes me want to read it again and again and again just to experience the people Ed Kennedy helps or hurts.  I want to go through all the Aces and \\"protect the diamonds, survive the clubs, dig deep through the spades, and feel the hearts\\".  Again and again and again.  It makes me want to buy all of the author's other books and stay up for days finishing them <br /> <br />THIS BOOK IS POSITIVELY AMAZING!!! One of if not THE best book that I have read!  Please check it out, you don't know what you are missing if you don't!
B00006JKOL|5.0|This is definitely one of the two or three tippity-top Tull albums. It's a bit more centered on an introspective snapshot of Ian's personal life and marital problems, rather than the usual grand philisophical themes, but the result is poignant and excellent.
B0000YB7Z8|4.0|Classics songs from Jethro Tull for who born listening Songs from the Woods and learned about Aqualung this CD is the choice.<br /><br />It's amazing the quality of old songs and a CD that every one should have at home for those raining days.
B00006JKON|4.0|Yes, there are a few shallow, fill-up-the-album type songs on here. Including one about having to fill up albums with shallow songs. But there are some excellent songs as well, touching on the usual themes of religious silliness, individuality, and \\"living large,\\" that make this a must-have for any serious Tull fan.
1582701709|5.0|This is a great companion to the DVD. I work in a call center where I can read between calls. Pieces are short enough to read between calls and keep me motivated all day. I've already seen results in my life.
B00005NTJM|4.0|This is not the Tull that made history, but the history behind the Tull. Fun to listen to, if you like the band.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|I have to admit I was a bit excited when hearing of a new Bond. Honestly. I grew tired of Brosnan and the GQ style films. Now nothing can be said to please all of the Bond purists. We all have our favorite film and actor. I like films from each one. Now here it is... Daniel Craig, welcome to the role that needed you. I hope you stay in the Service a while. Too many compliments can't do this film justice. Masterfully acted and directed. Stuart Baird deserved an editing nomination as well. The opening theme by Chris Cornell is the most driven since \\"A View to a Kill.\\" This two disc set is a beautiful transfer with excellent color and clarity. The most breath-taking and exciting entry to date.
B000002LND|5.0|The Immaculate Collection spans Madonna's '80s and early '90s tracks. Conceived as a greatest hits collection, this album also contained two new tracks, the ever-so-naughty, Justify My Love and the vocally powerful, Rescue Me. Some of my favorite songs include: Vogue, Cherish, Lucky Star, Material Girl, La Isla Bonita, and Live to Tell. Every song is a classic, no duds here. Madonna just keeps on getting better and better, one of the most important, influential, and provactive woman entertainers of our generation. I also recommend her best album to date, Ray of Light as well. Enjoy this non-stop party from our girl, Madge.
B00006CXSS|5.0|I bought this for someone else, watched it with them and now I'm a fan of it.
0066620996|2.0|Sorry, if I know anything about business it's that going from bad to ok or ok to good is a much better return and far more likely than going from good to great. If you want to know something about being personally responsible for greatness then try reading Rockefeller's The difficult art of getting.
B000J3EEBY|5.0|This latest album after a long interval continues Ms. McKennitt's expression of music that I would call \\"World Celtic\\". Her highly innovative albums of the past created this niche. I really enjoy this and have listen to the album several times.  It has caused me to buy tickets to her upcoming tour.  I highly recommend this album.  Enjoy!
B00005YXZH|5.0|Wilco had already been around for many years when they released this record and had received their fair share of critical plaudits. But nothing in their back catalogue sounded as good as this record. \\"Yankee Hotel Foxtrot\\" combines excellent songwriting with spare, effective production to create one of the best records of the decade so far. Alienation is a recurring theme in these songs and there are times when the slightly deadpan vocals or bursts of dissonance aim in the same direction but overall the sound of this album is warm and personal. The guitars have a clean, warm sound and the songs are written more from the heart than the head. A word that springs to mind is likeable: this is an easy album to like and keep coming back to.
B000002L9J|5.0|Depending on your point of view, The Smiths' 1985 album Meat is Murder may or may not have been a sophomore slump. After all, their second release (Hatful of Hollow) was a collection of rarities and singles. While for most bands this would be a pointless delaying tactic, for The Smiths it simply confirmed them as the UK's best new band. Perhaps this made the disappointment of Meat Is Murder all the more inevitable, but that was all quickly forgiven and forgotten with the band's 1986 masterpiece The Queen Is Dead.<br /><br />This album includes some of the band's very best singles equally great album tracks. Morrissey and Marr were almost always at their very best, but on The Queen Is Dead they outdo even themselves. Never one to shy away from meglomania, Moz compares himself (perhaps aptly) to Joan of Arc on the insistent \\"Bigmouth Strikes Again\\", and again sings of homosexuality in a not-so-cryptic fashion on the wonderful \\"The Boy With the Thorn in His Side\\". Together, these songs show the two sides of Morrissey's lyrical coin: in the case of \\"Bigmouth\\", the lyrics are vivid and poetic, while the lyrics to \\"The Boy With the Thorn\\" are simple and repetitive, but just as penetrating. But as great as these singles are, \\"There Is a Light That Never Goes Out\\" is perhaps the band's greatest track ever. It was not released as a single, but it was featured on the compilation Singles because the disc would have been incomplete without it. (Really, has Morrissey ever more succinctly summed up his worldview than when he said \\"To die by your side, well the pleasure, the privilege is mine\\"?)<br /><br />When one can listen to an album and look forward to the hits and non-hits equally, then the album is a truly Great one. \\"There Is a Light\\" is the best example on The Queen Is Dead of The Smiths' ability to achieve this feat. However, this brilliant record is filled to the brim with songs of comparable quality. \\"The Queen Is Dead/Take Me Back to Dear Old Blightly\\" is one of the rockingest songs The Smiths ever recorded. It is also the rare instance when the band uses six-and-a-half minutes to full effect. \\"I Know It's Over\\" is the first of two songs in which Morrissey places himself in a graveyard. In this case, his empty bed serves as his cemetery plot. The other is the jaunty \\"Cemetry Gates\\", his prefered place to spend a sunny day pitting his beloved Oscar Wilde against Keats and Yeats. (The song's somewhat lame moral to not plagiarize is hardly it's strong point.) There are also several moment's of comic relief, including \\"Frankly Mr. Shankly\\", \\"Vicar In A Tutu\\", and \\"Some Girls Are Bigger Than Others\\". The second of these tracks, in which the title character represents all those who wish to be themselves without apology to anyone else, is probably the best of the three. It is also permits Johnny Marr to indulge his fondness for rockabilly.<br /><br />Given the short career of The Smiths, it is easier to pick one of their albums as their best one. The consensus is that The Queen Is Dead is just that. I agree, but their first and last albums are also 5-star records. Interestingly, Morrissey and Marr have both said that \\"Strangeways, Here We Come\\" (their last one) is better than their debut and The Queen Is Dead. Whatever the case, The Queen Is Dead is one of the greatest albums of the 80s, as well as one of the greatest of the two decades that have passed since its release. Anywhere - except for Meat Is Murder - is a great place to start with The Smiths, and you are bound to end up with everything if you like what you first hear. Apart from one of the compilations (Hatful of Hollow, Louder Than Bombs, Singles), The Queen Is Dead is probably the one that you will most often listen to in its entirety.The Smiths ever recorded.

B000A0GYD2|5.0|With the passion of Tom Hanks and the funding from HBO, \\"From the Earth To the Moon\\" has the potential for something special, and it doesn't disappoint.  This dramatic story goes beyond the feats of the amazing astronauts and goes into the lives of the thousands of scientists and politicians, and the country behind them, that made it possible for an American to be the first person to land on the moon.  A must have for the space nut or anyone that can appreciate what humans are capable of if they put their mind to it.

B000HEWEE4|4.0|No plot description; everyone knows it by now. Just some personal thoughts. <br />The other day, my wife & I, both being Sandra Bullock fans, settled down to watch - even as I thought: \\"Oh no, another chick flick\\". We loved it, regardless of the brain-bursting impossibilities & plot-holes. Many pages of website comments show that most have the same affection for TLH, even as they lambast it for its absurdities - in spite of 2/3 of \\"Rotten Tomato\\" critics shouting it down. Why these viewer reactions? <br />I'm an analytical sort of guy, so I organized my thoughts. <br /> <br />(1.) STAR POWER: though Sandra (Kate) provides the major horsepower which pulls the audience through to the end, Keanu (Alex) holds up his end. Some criticize him as being \\"wooden\\", but \\"restrained\\" is better. It suits the whole mood of the movie. <br /> <br />(2.) \\"ALL THE WORLD LOVES A LOVER\\": We have an instinct to root for this pair & ignore whatever pot-holes (plot-holes?) stand in their way. <br /> <br />(3.) PRODUCTION STYLE: Smooth, & steady; a metaphor for the inexorable passage of time that these folks endure. Every scene makes its impact without resorting to flashy, special effects - which would be inappropriate to the movie's style - although, by golly, some subtle \\"markers\\" clarifying the chronology would have helped. The realistic Chicago locations impart a subliminal sense of \\"This might really happen\\" - which helps, Lord knows. As for the house itself, it's just a fairy-tale concept, totally impractical. Hard to heat, and where's the sewer pipe? <br /> <br />(4.) RESTRAINED ACTING: Well suited to the elegaic, reflective mood of the story. Film students take note: the scene close to the end, in the architect's office. Kate spies the drawing of the lake house & is drawn to it as Boy Friend impatiently waits to depart. Kate, approaching the drawing, gives him a slight, backward \\"good-bye\\" wave. With this one gesture, we know instantly that Boy Friend is history. When told that Alexis the artist & do you know him? she smiles slightly & whispers \\"Oh...yeah...\\" She gently runs her hand over the picture frame, the gesture of one lover caressing the other, in absentia. When told that Alex is dead, her close-up is a masterpiece of subtlety, her expression conveys all the shattering emotion we know she feels, without any operatic hysteria & tears. LESS is truly MORE. <br /> <br />(5.)MUSIC: Most film scores do not stand up well when severed from the screen image. Not this one. Composer Rachel Portman's exquisite music (available on CD)  caresses every scene, wrapping them all in an irresistible mood of tender nostalgia. It casts a spell which smooths over all the plot rough spots, so that only the hardest heart is left unmoved. The CD is a winner; it provides \\"mood music\\" in the very best sense of the words. <br /> <br />Though TLH disappointed at the box office, I suspect it will creep up the lists of \\"Favorite Film Romances\\". Critic Roger Ebert gave it 3-1/2 stars (Wowee!) He liked it for its romantic heart. Concerning its absurdities, he shouted \\"Never mind! Just never mind\\". I agree. <br /> <br />HOWEVER... <br /> <br />Everyone - Sandy, director Agresti, editors Klingman & Brodersohn, writer Auburn - should get a sharp rap upside the head with a rolled-up script & told never to do this sort of thing again. We've cut some slack for TLH, but that's it! <br /> <br />As of this writing \\"Premonition\\" is looming over the horizon. From sketchy previews, it seems to have alarming similarities to TLH: live today, dead tomorrow, live again, etc. Sandy I hope ya know what you're doin'. <br />
0375707972|5.0|This was a required read in a class at a community college.  I probably would never have read this type of book.  I intend to read it again and again because of the time and place with which it was written.  Even though it was fiction, I would think that this was a story which might have happened!
B00064X3BI|5.0|This Album and his hit from the 90's \\"Journeyman\\", showcase this blue guitarist at his all time finest.  Many big hits on this song including Cocaine, Lay Down Sally, and Wonderful Tonight.  Just about all his radio hits from the '70's are here save Layla & I Shot The Sheriff.<br /><br />However, my personal favorite is Track 6: \\"The Core\\".  Clapton's mastery of the guitar, musical composition, and vocals really shine in this almost 9 min long beauty.  The interlude extended solo sounds like something you'd hear live - not on an album cut.  Enjoy!

B00001U0E1|5.0|This take on Shakespeare is one of the most lingeringly magnificent deeply moving movie that has come our way, bar none. The sound track, some hilarious scenes and stunning performances by many of our favorite actors take me to a time and place that is both timeless and spaceless.  It is divine to have a copy to watch whenever I want and when I do, I wake up to music that will not banish itself from my heart every morning for weeks.  Just loved this movie.
B00006LJ72|4.0|Brought this set to see what's the hype about enya.  The packaging is superb, although I would rather have simpler package if that means $10-15 in cost reduction.  The recording is fantastic, but the music is only so-so.  The tracks have mainstream appeal but often lack the complexity and beauty like those from Secret Garden's.  If you like this type of music, give Secret Garden a try.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I've never cared for Bond films.  Truth be told, my exposure has not been overwhelming, mostly in the form of various hyper-campy 70's versions and the dreadful Pierce Brosnan installments which I've caught in bits and pieces over the years despite my best efforts to avoid them.  No doubt there are films in the series that I would enjoy, but the bad impressions have always left me with little inclination to give them another look  The problem has been, well there have been various problems, but the key one is Bond himself, at least as portrayed by Brosnan and Moore.  He's always supposed to be witty and suave or whatever, but always comes off as completely lame.  I was plenty skeptical about \\"Casino Royale\\", but the almost universally positive reviews began rolling in, proclaiming it a darker and less campy entry, with a great, intense turn from Daniel Craig.  The reviews were right: Craig is great as Bond, providing one of the finest troubled action heroes in recent memory and washing away the bitter taste of Brosnan's groan-inducing performances.  Equally significant, \\"Casino Royale\\" has nicely varied, well-constructed and often suprisingly intense action scenes.  As many others have pointed out, \\"Casino Royale\\" is definitely a bit overlong, but when it's on it's really on, and proves to be more than worth the wait through the slower sections.<br /><br />\\"Casino Royale\\" brings us back to Bond's beginnings, opening with the dual executions that earned him his 00 status.  This black and white, uber-noir opening sequence is simply as cool as all hell.  So damn cool, in fact, that the film has little hope of topping it, and never does.  This points to one of the flaws in the film which is intertwined with the film's excessive length:  \\"Casino Royale\\" tends to get weaker as it moves along.  The first hour or so is pretty much flat-out awesome, with the great opening being followed by a severely cool free-running style chase through a construction site and into an embassy, and later by an intense, over-the-top encounter in an airport.  Once we really start to get involved in the gambling tournament, however, the film loses some steam.  Turns out that Texas Hold 'Em isn't as thrilling as killing people/explosions/whatever.  Now, there's still some killing at this point, the tournament itself is not without interest, and we've got Eva Green to leer at, but the second act is, nevertheless, unquestionably weaker than the first.  This downward trend culminates in the overlong false ending, though this is partially redeemed by a rather sweet final shootout.  \\"Casino Royale\\" never loses momentum entirely, not by a long shot, but it definitely could've stood to have the tournament tightened up a bit, and the false ending trimmed by at least a few minutes.  The first hour would've still been the best part, and the first scene the best scene, but the overall difference wouldn't be as glaring.<br /><br />The action-packed first hour proves to be exposition, for the most part, culminating in Bond's foiling of a plot on the part of the film's main villain, Le Chiffre, to destroy a new airplane and reap grand financial rewards via the plummeting stocks.  Bond's intervention costs La Chiffre many  millions of dollars, and, more troubling for Le Chiffre, he is a sort of terrorist banker abd wasn't playing with his own money.  If Le Chiffre can't recoup 100 mil quickly he's a dead man, so he comes up with a peculiar plan: In order to get this cash fast he decides to host an ultrahigh stakes poker tournament at the Casino Royale in Montenegro.  Bond is sent to Montenegro to enter in the tournament and ensure that Le Chiffre loses and then must flee into British custody to save his own life and, as a natural extension, provide valuable on his various clients.<br /><br />Though \\"Casino Royale\\" is certainly darker than any other Bond film I've seen, it's still very clearly identifiable as one.  It still has some corny humor and a rather outlandish plot, but this is offset by the cold, dangerous Craig and the harsher violence.  Le Chiffre is also a bit toned down as far as Bond villains are concerned.  He's not exactly the most terrifying or intriguing figure around, but he's serviceable enough.  (This is Craig's film, anyway.)  Eva Green plays Vesper Lynn, an accountant sent along to make sure Bond doesn't screw things up too bad.  She's quite credible and grounds the oft-outlandish film a bit, on top of being as hot as hell.<br /><br />Unsurprisingly, the film doesn't end with the tournament in Montenegro, though I won't give away further specifics.  The final act is, again, a bit overlong, but it allows the film to have a bit more emotional impact than it would've had otherwise.  That, and, watching the film a second time, the false ending doesn't take quite as long as it seemed to the first time around, now that you know it's coming, and the final action scene is, again, quite cool.<br /><br />Yeah, that's it.  Cool stuff, enough so that I'm actually looking forward to the next Bond film, whenever it may come out.  I'd not have anticipated that that would ever happen.<br /><br />Grade: B+by the cold, dangerous Craig and the harsher violence.

0064430170|4.0|What can I say about a classic. It's a great bed-time book for all kids especially those under 4. The book itself is a liitle large but that makes it great for reading to a group of kids.
B000MNP2KI|2.0|I can't believe so many people liked this movie.  The more previews that I saw, the better this movie looked.  My brother and I were pretty excited about watching it.  I had also seen a behind the scenes where they talked about dropping the gadgets and special effects and getting back to basics.  I was thinking that this was going to be good spy film based in the 50's - 60's with some solid action, since it was a prequel titled with the novel \\"Casino Royal\\".    This definitely wasn't the case.  It took me a while to figure out, but it's not a prequel kind of.  It's set in 2006, and they just started out with a brand new James Bond.  Not the actor, the character.  The movie starts with Bond just being given 00 status in 2006, which means the previous Bond films don't exist.  Somehow though, some of the characters have been retained (\\"M\\" and a Felix).  So basically, I'm not sure why they even chose to call this a Bond movie.    On to the content:  The movie starts out fairly well considering the confusing sequencing, but it goes astray about 2/3 of the way through.  The poker game scenes are just boring and too split up.  Recycled plot line: He is betrayed yet again by his own people. like in the Halle Berry Bond movie (Die Another Day) and similar to the MI movies.  The movie is filled with cell phones.  Cell phones, cell phones and more cell phones.  I wouldn't exactly call the technology used in the movie as back to basics.  The instant remote poison analysis (via satellite?) was about as easy for me to take as the completely invisible car in the Halle Berry Bond film (Die Another Day).    There's about 30-45 mins of too much film in the 2:21 movie.  I actually asked my brother if he had picked up the Director Wife's cut by accident.  During the recovery sequence I was waiting for one of the walls to glitch as if he was in a VR system, like in a previous Bond movie.  Spoiler alert: there are 2, yes 2 separate scenes with Bond walking out of the surf in swim trunks.Wohoo.  There's too much \\"M\\" and an emotional \\"M\\" in the movie.  I think there was even less \\"M\\" on film in the movie where she was taken prisoner.    If someone asks you to watch this movie with them, just tell them, \\"No you go on with out me, I'm just going to drown myself.\\"

0307276902|5.0|This is a terrifying novel about drug and alcohol addiction and rehabilitation. Anyone who has been or is in rehab for anything should be required to read this book. Anyone who has family members in rehab should read this book. Basically, everyone over the age of 14 should have to read this book.<br /><br />It depicts the horrible tragedy of addiction and how Mr. Frey overcomes it. He knows that he has an addiction problem when he wakes up on a plane not knowing how he got there, where the plane is going, or how he got a broken nose and a hole through his cheek. When the plane lands, he gets off the plane and has his parents drive him to rehab, where he receives detoxification and learns how to control his drinking and drug addictions.<br /><br />The book is his journey through rehab and how be becomes a better person. There is a lot of vulgarity and things that seem inappropriate but are a must for the story. The language is probably how everyone talked and the extreme drug situations are really what he went through.<br /><br />There has been a lot of controversy over this book because there are parts that are \\"embellished\\" and altered. If you can see though all of that, then this book is truly amazing. I wouldn't suggest reading this book if you are under the age of fourteen due the language and theme of the book. You also might not want to read A MILLION LITTLE PIECES if you have a faint heart or easily get sick to your stomach because there are some extremely graphic scenes in the book. This is one I highly recommend, though.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Taylor Rector
B00005JPFQ|3.0|Mark Steven Johnson keeps trying to put unlikely heroes up on the screen.  He wrote the story of \\"Jack Frost,\\" about a father-cum-snowman who tries to bond with his son after he's already died (sorta).  He produced \\"Elektra,\\" about the jaded and acrobatic wunder-assassin of the same name.  And he wrote and directed \\"Daredevil,\\" a finely-filmed flop concerning the life and times of a blind do-gooder with super duper hearing.  None of these films were very well received, and their box office receipts were poor, at best.<br /><br />\\"Ghost Rider\\" is like those others with one very important difference; it's making money.  Johnson's budgets have inexplicably risen since each successive flub, and finally it appears to be paying off.  Hell if I know why.  After all, \\"Ghost Rider\\" adheres to Johnson's superhero formula without much straying; perhaps it's just a matter of a larger fan base or greater advance anticipation.  Or maybe people have stopped taking these kinds of movies so seriously.<br /><br />That's not a bad thing, but it isn't entirely good, either.  The Batman series, for example, was in serious decline precisely because it began to rely entirely on big names, brassy settings and effects, and heaping gobs of camp value.  It wasn't until Christopher Nolan took the franchise and injected a serious dose of soul into it (\\"Batman Begins\\") that people started to pay attention again and see beyond the conventional comic book trappings and into what made (and still makes) comics such a successful industry: the relatable idealism of its metaphors.<br /><br />Where does \\"Ghost Rider\\" fit into all of this?  Well, you have the typically tortured soul, Johnny Blaze (played as an adult by a slightly stunned Nicolas Cage sporting a chia-pet-esque hairdo), who is the son of a daredevil (wink, wink) and who is even a daredevil himself.  Blaze Jr. accidentally (yes, accidentally!) makes a pact with Mephistopheles (let's call him, oh, I don't know, Satan) which turns him, years later, into a sort of demonic bounty hunter.  Satan (in the guise of Peter Fonda, who fills this role with a sleepy sort of love) hires Blaze/Ghost Rider to catch four rogue demons, one of those demons being (drumroll) Satan's own son (the other three could form a band: Earth, Wind, and ... Water?).<br /><br />Of course there's a love interest (Eva Mendes).  Of course our hero buries himself beneath a mound of self-pity and regret.  Of course there's a wise-cracking buddy (Donal Logue) and a mysterious stranger who is full of key plot points (Sam Elliott).  Those things don't make the movie bad.  In fact, they're a cheeky nod at all of those comic book truisms; they're a silly-serious element to an otherwise gloomy and rather incoherent film.<br /><br />I'll be fair; I'm not a big \\"Ghost Rider\\" reader, so I don't really know the rules that govern his world, but, equally fairly, the movie doesn't bother explaining them to us.  When Blaze becomes his alter ego, he is a leather-bound skeleton cocooned in flames.  This is cool enough, but it does make it confusing when, for instance, Ghost Rider is almost choked to death by one of the demons (skeletons have esophaguses?).  And his horrific \\"Penitence Stare?\\"  Well, I still don't really know what it does.<br /><br />I try hard not to care, but when you turn your mind away from one thing, there must be something else to turn it to, and there's not much else here.  Batman and Bond both found new life in characters with more humanity, but Ghost Rider's life seems to exist solely in the fire that surrounds him.  Cage as Blaze does a good job of mixing humor with pathos (it's fun just watching him mope), but when he's the blazing Rider, he's all burning bone.  It's hard to gauge the inner turmoils, thoughts, dreams, plans, subterfuges, and conflicts of a hero who wears the exact same skull-grin expression no matter what he's doing.  The special effects of his incindiary bike, his chain-wielding stunts, his tete-a-tetes with the unholy hosts -- those are all popcorn-munching fun; but this reviewer would've been doubly impressed if those same special effects had been employed to do something else: give a skeleton some heart.a-tetes with the unholy hosts -- those are all popcorn-munching fun; but this reviewer would've been doubly impressed if those same special effects had been employed to do something else: give a skeleton some heart.
1416914285|5.0|Clary Fray thinks she's a fairly ordinary fifteen-year-old girl--until the world as she knows it falls apart, all starting the night she and her best friend, Simon, visit the Pandemonium Club. Sure, in a city the size of New York, a lot of weird things happen; Clary didn't expect to witness one of the weirdest.<br /><br />What she sees that night is a murder, a murder committed by tattoo-covered teenagers no one else can see--a murder with no body left behind. That's certainly a sign that Clary's life is about to get a little farther away from normal, and it certainly does so.<br /><br />Clary's life is falling to pieces. Her mother goes missing. Clary is attacked by a creature - a demon. She's seeing things no one else can--including the Shadowhunters, demon hunters whose world is hidden within Clary's own. She meets three young Shadowhunters - Jace, Alec, and Isabelle - and is quickly sucked into their world, searching for her mother, trying to protect herself, trying to sort out what's real, what's true, and what's not. It is, obviously, a bit much for anyone to handle, but Clary's got no choice. Along the way, she's discovering her past, herself, and just who the Shadowhunters really are.<br /><br />This debut novel from a brilliant, smart new voice in young adult literature is a marvelous adventure, full of fantastic twists and turns just when they're least expected. The complexity of the story, the threads from the past and present intertwined, is reminiscent of the Harry Potter series--and that's high praise!<br /><br />The writing of this magical story is excellent, and I was very impressed with the wonderfully lifelike characters and amazing magical world hidden within our own. I was reminded of Holly Black's mastery of the urban fantasy genre. The captivating story told by the very talented Cassandra Clare in CITY OF BONES is surely the start of a brilliant series--I can't wait for the next MORTAL INSTRUMENTS book. This paranormal fantasy is truly unforgettable.<br /><br />Reviewed by:  Jocelyn Pearceunforgettable. <br /> <br />Reviewed by:  Jocelyn Pearce
B00005B1W5|5.0|Of course, it all started with Yanni: Live At The Acropolis.  The intoxicating mixture of upbeat and romantic/nostalgic moods with that catchy Greek rhythm.  A soundtrack for any life with all its highs and lows, happiness and sadness, triumph and tragedy.  And then Yanni realizes that all cultures have music to offer and that music transcends languages and barriers of all types, as well as ages!  And so along comes Tribute, enhanced by the souls and instruments of different cultures inhabiting the world of today as well as ages long past and almost forgotten.  And as exciting as the concert is to watch; both the performers and the audience, it only whets the appetite to have an opportunity to see a live performance. To be part of that whirl of humanity and to drop all mental and physical barriers so that you can be part of that collective world dance that celebrates life and its gifts.
B000021Y7X|5.0|Like others who have posted, this movie was what made me a Talking Heads fan, and though I never became a fanatic, this film is the concert VHS tape I have worn out the most over the years.  Like Byrne says on the excellent commentary track, this was so effectively made from the audience point of view that when it screened, people applauded between songs and danced in the aisles.  I know we did, way back when.<br /><br />Today I got the DVD and just have to give props to the special features.  There's bonus songs, the aforementioned commentary track, two 5.1 mixes, and a hiliarious 4.5 minute segment where David Byrne interviews himself.  That is, David the interviewee sits in the house left chair, in his big suit.  Then David the interviewer sits in the house right chair, constantly switching (in cut time) to new costumes and personas to ask the questions.<br /><br />Right now, off the top of my head, if I had to rank Desert Island music DVD's, I'd go like this:<br /><br />1)  Talking Heads:  Stop Making Sense<br /><br />2)  The Band:  Last Waltz<br /><br />3)  Grateful Dead:  Truckin' Off to Buffalo<br /><br />4)  Suzanne Vega:  Live at Montreaux<br /><br />5)  AC/DC:  Live at Donnington

071563318X|1.0|Reading like a field manual, one would think that this book would be a good coffee table book for those people that have military or paramilitary backgrounds, but this is simply not the case.  What could have been a comical read instead comes across as compilation of misunderstanding and incorrect details from an author who didn't even bother to do basic research on the weapons, tactics, or any of the factual things in the book. <br /> <br />The author creates a zombie creature which is not even believable to the casual observer.  (a creature, no matter how supernatural, has to get energy from SOMEWHERE) His description of the weapons systems in the book are full of factual errors.  (The difference between a carbine and non-carbine is the length of the barrel, not the ammunition.  Silencers are just as illegal as grenades.  The .22 rifle fires a round the same diameter as the M16.  The list goes on)  Even the poorly presented \\"historical events\\" are full of errors.  (Microwaves are not nuclear radiation, for example, and nuclear reactors are \\"critical\\" whenever they are producing power) <br /> <br />Please save yourself the trouble of buying this book.

0374105235|5.0|I felt so strongly about this book, that I am buying a copy for my friends. I feel that all of us, especially Americans, have so much to learn about the reality of War, any War. In a moving, honest, non-histrionic manner, Mr Beah tells his story, Death so horrifying yet matter-of-fact, with children pitted against each other, kill or be killed, survive or don't, a random stroke of luck in a harsh world that no one should have to suffer. And yet, we continue to send boys to kill other boys; maybe this book will help spread the reality, and show us the true power of redemption inherent in all of us.

B000CNDIZE|2.0|I expected more from such a soulful vocalist.  This album does her no justice.  The music is poppy and the vocals are sometimes too soft and muffled to the point where it sounds like she is not even opening her mouth.  It gets annoyingly whiney at certain points.  I was not pleased at all.  I hope she picks it up a bit next time.  Her stuff with Zero-7 was much more enjoyable and emphasized the potential in her vocal style.
B00004S3AN|5.0|Dave Brubeck's Time Out is a great classic whose appeal has stood and will continue to stand the test of time. I'm not a jazz afficionado or hep cat, but I dig all the tunes from this 1959 release, just as I already did those of Miles Davis' all-time classic from the same year, Kind of Blue.    In my opinion, Time Out and Kind of Blue are the essential jazz releases. You can build your jazz collection to complement them, but you cannot truly add anything in terms of quality.    Time Out is a most pleasant work for those who have had a stressful day. A mellow yet upbeat pace is prevalent throughout, as was well commercialized and publicized in the million-selling single off the album, Take Five.    A few years ago, I reviewed Elvis Presley's Back in Memphis as one very soulful and relaxing CD. On a parallel note, I can assure you that Time Out is unequivocally a very soothing and jazzy contribution to the world of music.
B00000IMTE|4.0|I'm sure I am not the only one trying to convert all of my old albums to CD.  It is great to hear a clean crisp recording of this classic Rainbow line up.  I have to get used to hearing certain songs without the scratches and popping, but I will enjoy it.  Another great album changed over, this one has always been a favorite with Dio and Blackmore together, the ballads and the heavy riffs blend perfectly. <br />
B00005JMUA|5.0|I sometimes joke that, to me, Kill Bill, Volume 1 is the second-greatest movie of all time and that Kill Bill, Volume 2 is the greatest movie ever. On a serious note, both volumes are excellent releases and do not disappoint, especially for Tarantino fans who were hoping for intense elements of Pulp Fiction. <br /> <br />Kill Bill, Volume 2 picks up with Black Mamba's rampage for redemption and revenge for the murder of her fiance and those closest to him. From start to finish is action in sync with brilliant dialogue that is mixed in with occasional flashes of humor. <br /> <br />Beatrix Kiddo, aka Black Mamba, as played by Uma Thurman, is a woman on a mission, a kind of mission where no one in this sequel can truly assist her. Besides her weapons, there is no support or assistance that she will be receiving in order to possess the physical and psychological edges that will be needed in order to overcome what were her nemeses. <br /> <br />Some very scary situations and predicaments are myriad throughout, but much inspiration can be drawn from witnessing the outcomes resulting from Beatrix Kiddo's firm resolve to not be overcome by fear and panic in the worst of situations, perilous or not. <br /> <br />Great music accompanies the fighting sequences that Kiddo must endure and the haphazardous journey travels that have to be undertaken. Charlie Feathers' Can't Hardly Stand It and three Ennio Morricone classics from movies past, namely Il Tramonto, L'Arena, and A Silhouette of Doom are aptly mixed in, along with other great musical arrangements and reproductions that unanimously make both Kill Bill Volumes not only among the greatest in motion pictures but also in movie soundtracks. <br /> <br />Again, great action, great dialogue, and great music combine along with a great cast that only Quentin Tarantino could amalgamate for this awesome, winning formula.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|When Pierce Brosnan was cast as bond, I thought nobody could fit the part better...but somehow Hollywood outdid itself this time, and Daniel Craig steps in brilliantly.  Not only Does Craig add his presence and raw character, but the script writing and actions have been pumped as well.  Gone are the corny cracks that Bonds of the past have made, and in comes actual suspense and drama.  Yes, this bond does get a couple of little joke in...\\"I think I have an ich\\". But for the most part he is portrayed much more as a human, at times his armor came down.  But the ending leaves us with the traditional Bond, who always gets his man.  I felt pulled into this movie from the beginning, never a dull moment.  And the action and senerios were not completely over the top, lasers, masterminded evil villians, just lots of wheelin and dealing, deseption and decite.  SO many twists, just when one ended, another began.  This is a must have for bond fans. Check it out.
B000LC55F2|5.0|_The Prestige_ (2006) is a movie based on a book by the same name featuring a rivalry between two stage magicians in late 19th century London.  The movie itself demonstrates the extremes to which many magicians of the period were willing to go in order to pull off their stunts.  The movie also explains many of these tricks, including such tricks as escaping from a locked box underwater with hands tied, the appearance of a fish bowl from under a cloth (practiced by a Chinese magician who was willing to go through life pretending to be a cripple in order to avoid his trick being found out), the infamous \\"bullet catch\\", the disappearance and reappearance of a bird, and ultimately the \\"teleported man\\".  The movie title is a fitting one, which can be understood once the movie has been watched.  It refers to the fact that there are three stages to a magical act (as explained by the older magician at the beginning of the movie).  These stages are as follows:  \\"the pledge\\" (in which the magician shows the audience something that appears ordinary), \\"the turn\\" (where the magician makes the ordinary act extraordinary, such as by disappearing), and \\"the prestige\\" (where the final effect of the illusion is produced, such as the reappearance of the object).  It is to the question of exactly how \\"the prestige\\" is played out in the so-called \\"teleported man\\" trick that the movie must address.  The movie features a dark atmosphere in Victorian London and shows the dangers of obsession.  The movie also features a cameo appearance by the eccentric scientist and inventor Nikola Tesla (whose bizarre inventions were far ahead of his time, and who is still believed by many to have discovered many secrets which remain uncovered at this time).  In this movie, Tesla does manage to develop something that is truly extraordinary (in his rivalry with Thomas Edison) and the true gruesome nature of this discovery as played out in the magical act of one of the magicians is not revealed until the end. <br /> <br />To begin with the movie starts out with both magicians Alfred Borden and Robert Angier as assistants to Milton the magician.  In their effort to stretch the boundaries of their magical skills, the magicians concoct a stunt in which Angier's wife has her hands and legs tied and is then placed into a tank of water with a locked top.  During one of the performances, Borden may have tied a knot which Angier's wife could not escape from (though he cannot remember exactly which knot he tied) and this leads to the tragedy of Angier's wife drowning within the box before it can be broken open.  Angier blames Borden for his wife's death and thus begins the rivalry between the two magicians.  During one of his performances, Borden attempts to perform the notoriously dangerous \\"bullet catch\\"; however, Angier arrives in the crowd in disguise and volunteers to fire the gun at Borden.  Borden is injured because of Angier's tampering and thus loses two fingers.  Later in the movie, Borden performs a bizarre stunt called the \\"teleported man\\", in which he enters one door and reappears instantaneously at another door halfway across the stage.  (As will be discovered later in the movie, this \\"stunt\\" has a personal effect on him and involves great sacrifice.)  In an effort to one-up Borden, Angier (calling himself \\"The Great Danton\\") must resort to extreme measures.  Originally he uses a double to perform the same trick; however, this soon proves impossible as his double turns on him.  So he must visit Tesla who lives in Colorado in America at the time.  Tesla devises a special method for Angier to conduct his trick.  To see how the rest of the movie is resolved you must watch as it plays out.  However, the ending is particularly gruesome, as obsession becomes murderous.  Both men turn out to have taken extreme measures to perform this trick and the costs include human lives.  (Note:  The eerie foreshadowing in the magical trick involving the bird.  In which, the bird must be murdered in order for the trick to work.) <br /> <br />This movie is a thoroughly enjoyable one and has been compared to another movie about stage magic which recently came out called _The Illusionist_.  Both movies are very good though they are quite different from each other.  This movie is certainly entertaining but ultimately very gruesome and not for the overly squeamish.  It is certainly worth watching however if you can appreciate being dazzled by the uncanny individuals who practice stage magic.  <br />

B000002P2V|4.0|I like this album. I've owned it since 1979 and still put it on from time to time.  Some of the songs may \\"miss the mark\\", but it all depends on what sort of mood I am in. This album at least has some variety to it. A fun album with some good music. What else do you want? <br />
B000099T2L|3.0|I was very anxious about getting this album but it didn't meet up to all the hype it was getting. The best tracks are the ballads \\"Speechless & \\"The Closer I Get To You\\", \\"Crazy In Love\\". It was nothing incredible but not a complete disappointment. She's alot better in the group with the material that's presented on the albums especially Destiny Fulfilled. Don't bother with B'day, it only has 10 tracks and doesn't pay to have an album that doesn't live up to the hype.

B0007P3582|3.0|This album surely has all the gangsta qualilites personified, but fails to meet some basic criteria. The beats seem dumbed down since his debut, \\"Get Rich or Die Trying\\" and his lyrical flow seems altered. I think 50's been too caught up with other projects (like all the other G-Unit albums, his major motion picture, his videogame, and the soundtrack for his film). <br /> <br />50 surely did bring back the meaning to the word \\"gangsta\\" in 2003 but he seems to be preoccupied or weakend somehow. The Game's \\"The Documentary\\", which released about the same time, really blows this one over. But I think they both sold 5 million copies anyway. <br /> <br />Mr. Jackson may or may not realize the considerably low standards of his album, but his next release \\"Before I Self-Destruct\\", scheduled for release in summer of 2007, is said to be a sure-fire chart-topper. It will feature appearances by artists such as Eminem (of course), Ludacris, and Jay-Z! <br /> <br />Top songs: <br />          1.) Hate It or Love It (G-Unit Remix) <br />          2.)

0374105235|5.0|It's hard to put into words how strong this book is.  It's simply written and although it's an easy read in terms of prose, it may be a difficult read for those who can't stomach its almost relentless violence.  It's mind-boggling how man can be so inhumane, and the author doesn't even try to explain it. The constant senseless slaughter of innocent civilians is mind-boggling.  It is downright unbelievable what goes on in some parts of the world, and especially disheartening that truly innocent children grow up surrounded by such evil.  This book is truly scarier than any fiction I have ever read.
B000084T18|5.0|Despite all the haters out there, particularly now for G-Unit & 50 Cent..take a listen to this. This album is 50 in his prime and contains some of Dre's best beats (some of which he was supposed to have used on the upcoming Detox, but felt generous). <br /> <br />Eminem's production is off da chain! I didn't know my boy could produce beats and baselines like that! It's true, 50 didn't have anything to do with the production of the beats, but his lyrics are really up to par in this album and his style is irresistable. That sounds gay, but whatever. <br /> <br />This 2003 release will live on to be the best rap album since Dre's Chronic 2001. It features other artists such as the boys from G-Unit, Nate Dogg and Eminem. This album is a straight classic in the hip-hop world, I would really recommend rap lovers to purchase this. Great debut by Curtis! <br /> <br />Top Songs: <br />            1.) In Da Club <br />            2.) Many Men  <br />            3.) 21 Questions ft. Nate Dogg <br />            4.)

B00003CWRX|4.0|THE INSIDER is so many things at once that it becomes hard to catalog them.  It is, at the same time, a movie about two men who fight against the system and large corporations, a semi-historical account of the real life whistle blower who brought down the tobacco industry with the help of an intrepid news reporter and news agency, an examination of ordinary characters made into heroes by extraordinary pressures, and an exploration of journalistic ethics.  At a little over two and one half hours, director Michael Mann manages to squeeze everything into a tightly woven film that delivers everything it promises.<br /><br />The film opens up on a disconcerting image of cloth, only to realize that it is a head covering over the face of a man being escorted by armed soldiers through the dangerous streets of Lebanon.  Who is the masked man?  Where are they taking him?  Finally, they reach their destination and the masked man is seated in a chair before Hezbollah leader, Sheikh Fadlallah.  The meeting is about a possible interview between the Sheikh and 60 Minutes anchor, Mike Wallace.  Despite his dangerous circumstances, the masked man is surprisingly bold in the negotiations and manages to secure the interview.  The masked man is soon revealed to be none other than 60 Minutes produces, Lowell Bergman (Al Pacino).<br /><br />Meanwhile, a tired executive makes his way home in an unexplained daze.  We later find out that he is Jeffrey Wigand (Russell Crowe), a former head of research and development at tobacco giant Brown & Williamson, who has been recently fired for nonsense reasons.  Wigand has an expensive life, two daughters (one with asthma), and the prospect of losing his job is tremendously hard to bear.  The severance package they have offered him is limited, but does include medical.  But everyone knows that no one hires ex-tobacco scientists in the health profession.  Where will he find employment?  How will he support his family?<br /><br />With our two main protagonists situated and developed, the plot begins to thicken in order to bring our two heroes together.  A package is mysteriously sent to Bergman containing insider tobacco documents.  The only problem is that they are written in technical language.  Bergman is given Wigand's name as a possible \\"translator,\\" thus entwining our two protagonists for the rest of the film.  After much cat & mouse, Wigand eventually agrees to meet with Bergman to discuss the job.  Bergman's excellent instincts sense that there is a lot Wigand isn't sharing and he discovers the reason.  Wigand has signed a confidentiality agreement with his former employer, agreeing not to talk about company business on pain of losing his severance and medical benefits.  Slowly, Bergman begins the process of convincing Wigand to blow the whistle on his former employers.<br /><br />What evolves is a classic tale rooted in real world events.  The first half of the film is dedicated to getting Wigand to testify and give an interview for 60 Minutes, risking his family's life, financial well-being, and sanity along the way.  Most films would have ended at this point, but with about an hour left to go, the film makes a dramatic turn, almost completely dropping Wigand out of the plot.  Under threat of litigation, CBS News decides not to run Wigand's interview.  Suddenly, Wigand is at risk of doing everything for nothing.  Bergman is outraged by CBS's decision and the film follows his character's attempts to fight against CBS to get it released.<br /><br />Hence, THE INSIDER is about two men who each fight their own respective corporations.  But while one can't ignore the \\"man versus the machine\\" aspect of the film, ultimately it doesn't seem to be Mann's primary interest.  What THE INSIDER truly focuses on is the character of our two protagonists.  Wigand decides to testify and blow the whistle on his former employer because he has betrayed his values working for the company.  He was a man of science and a man who worked for healthcare companies, he tells us early on, but who sold out for the money they offered him.  Wigand is, at times, an uncomfortably honorable character and the film seeks to restore himself in his own eyes.  Bergman is equally engrossing and, thanks to Pacino's superb performance, is, perhaps, even more inspiring to watch.  CBS's threat not to release the material is not an attack on the freedom of the press or on Bergman's hard work.  It is an attack on Bergman's personal integrity and honesty.  \\"I have never burned a source,\\" he tells us emphatically.  Whatever Bergman promises, he delivers.  And he shows us that he is willing to pay dearly in order to maintain that integrity.<br /><br />The performances are brilliant all the way around in this film.  Crowe's performance of a man pushed to the edge by extraordinary forces is brilliant.  I was nervous in every scene he was in and wondered if he would snap at any minute.  Pacino, as mentioned, is wonderful in his part, in a rather understated performance.  Christopher Plummer seems to capture Mike Wallace completely.  Though not many of us have had the chance to see Mike Wallace \\"off camera,\\" there is a certain believability to the performance that is undeniable.  No one gets to be the anchor of 60 Minutes unless he or she is prepared to play serious hardball.  It was refreshing to see.  Reminiscent of ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN, this film also manages to give you a very candid look into the making of broadcast news and all of the work that goes on behind the scenes (some of it quite dangerous) to produce a story.  Michael Mann's directing is quite capable; the music and sound compliments the beautiful imagery; and the script is well crafted.<br /><br />All in all, THE INSIDER is a great film that should have taken home some Oscars.  I highly recommend it.cience and a man who worked for healthcare companies, he tells us early on, but who sold out for the money they offered him.

B000LPQ6DE|5.0|All I can say is that I've watched many renditions of Jane Eyre and this is the best - hands down!
B000JBXXZ4|5.0|Once again Incubus reinvent themselves. Another Incubus album written like none of their previous ones, which is what Incubus is all about. I believe this is a great album and a more matured effort from their previous albums. At first listen, I was sceptical about the change but I should've known better. Listening to an Incubus album is like developing an acquired taste. You might not like at first but after a few tries you'll love it immensely. Each track sounds different from each other on the album and that shows their versatility in music writing, their openess to change & experimentations, and their creative talent. Some fans of Incubus say that this album is nothing like the album S.C.I.E.N.C.E or Morning View, and that is why it sucks but i believe in the exact opposite. I believe those people are resistant to change and are just looking for Incubus to create 'another' S.C.I.E.N.C.E album or something similiar to it. That is just boring in my opinion. I don't think they will do that, judging from how different each of their albums sound. The fact that Light Grenades is different from their previous efforts shows how talented they are as musicians and it definitely is a refreshing change in the music scene where a majority of bands put out their albums sounding exactly like their previous ones. \\"Nothing is permanent but change\\" - Heraclitus. MY ADVICE IS: First of all, Have an open mind when you listen to this album. Secondly, Don't relate and compare it to their previous albums. Thirdly, Don't listen to this album just once and make your judgement on it. Anything new & different takes a few listens before you can really appreciate it. And finally, Don't listen to the critics because they probably listened to this album once and made their judgement. OK thats my advice if you want to have a pleasureable experience while listening to this album. Eventually you'll find out how great this album is. I believe what Incubus does with the constant reinvention of themselves is fantastic and the evolution of their music can only get better with time. Again, \\"Nothing is permanent but change\\", So kudos to Incubus for constantly reinventing themselves. Favourite track : Dig. Listen to the bonus tracks: Punch-Drunk, Look Alive.

But the sound... well, it's full of thumps and booms and electronic instrumentation and overdubs and mixing and ...well , you get the picture... it's exactly what the kids like, and that's just the kind of recoding I'd expect from any 17 year old singer. If I were between 12 and 20 years old, I'd give it 5 stars.  This girl has a bright future and her music should mature nicely as she gets a little older.
0131177052|5.0|Have you struggled to get your legacy code under control? Maybe even that code you wrote in a hurry last year? Or that hairy monster that no-one in the team wants to touch because it's so short-tempered?<br /><br />If so, then this is the book for you. And I really can't recommend it too highly.<br /><br />Michael Feathers' book is an extremely well-written book on how to take existing code and work with it so that you can get it under test. In the process you'll learn tricks that you can use in the future. And you'll also enjoy reading it.<br /><br />You CAN escape from the tyranny of any code that refuses to yield to attempts at improvement. Feathers probably has several tricks to show you along the way. For just one example, look at his Pass Null trick on page 111.<br /><br />All of the book is a great read. In fact, any single chapter will give you techniques that will help you IMMEDIATELY. For me, the most useful part of the book is the section on Dependency Breaking Techniques.<br /><br />If you only learn a handful of these, you'll be a better code warrior and you'll feel more comfortable tackling any kind of messy code.<br /><br />I've recommended this book to many colleagues. I also put together a course on unit testing and used this book in many parts of the course. And I've bought several copies and handed them out to co-workers.

B00005JPLU|3.0|This is an exceptional visual comic book like fantasy movie, but not factual. The huge monstrous men, Rhinoceros, and other imaginative additions that weren't in the real battle should tell you that. This is visually and FX wise a treat, but it doesn't have the depth, truth, or feeling that \\"The 300 Spartans\\" has. If you think this is anything more than taking a true event and crossing it with a heavy metal cartoon, you are mistaken. I love \\"Heavy Metal\\" and FX as much as the next person. \\"300\\" and \\"The 300 Spartans\\" are likely to be watched by guys the most. Both have there special merits, but for owning, I think \\"The 300 Spartans\\" is better. \\"300\\" deserves at the very least a rental to see all the great visual work, some decent acting, and good storyboard scripting. I suggest you see both movies and decide for yourself. Each will leave you with your needed dose of heroism and great battle carnage, but they both may not give you the depth of character or make you feel you saw history made. BTW, don't waste your time voting negative if you haven't even seen \\"The 300 Spartans\\". Nothing that makes me want to trash a movie more than negative votes from people that don't even take the time to be objective and actually see something else. So if I get alot of negative votes I will know it is people that haven't even seen \\"The 300 Spartans\\".<br /><br />Anyone that has seen \\"The 300 Spartans\\" knows that all CGI alone used in \\"300\\" does not make a good movie. Acting and special effects used instead tends to improve the quality. Had this movie had more of a living cast and used some real life special effects it would have been much better. The music needed improvement as well. I liked the music for \\"Gladiator\\", \\"Conan the Barbarian\\", and \\"The 13th Warrior\\", I wasn't impressed with the music for \\"300\\". Does it have some good acting and great effects? Absolutely. I am certainly not saying don't see this movie. I'm just not giving it 5 stars to put it in the same class as movies like \\"Gladiator\\", \\"The 13th Warrior\\", \\"Conan the Barbarian\\", \\"The 300 Spartans\\", \\"Spartacus\\", and \\"Ben Hur\\". It is good, just not that good. Oh one other thing, I find it amusing when a reviewer says critics aren't needed. We could say the same about fans of movies. If you are just going to lob praise all over a movie, what's the point of reading your review? Objectivity would not be present. When I read a review with some criticism and some comparison to other works I know there is at least a shred of objectivity. That helps me decide whether a movie is worth my time, not when someone can't stand anyone to criticize any part of it.Gladiator\\", \\"The 13th Warrior\\", \\"Conan the Barbarian\\", \\"The 300 Spartans\\", \\"Spartacus\\", and \\"Ben Hur\\". It is good, just not that good. Oh one other thing, I find it amusing when a reviewer says critics aren't needed. We could say the same about fans of movies.

B000HBK3MM|5.0|Lots of times when I get a new CD I have to listen to it a few times before I begin to appreciate it.  This CD had me hooked from the first note. It is one of the best I have ever bought.  The lyrics sometimes are a bit sophomoric, but the melodies are addictive, and I love the fact that she is the writer or co-writer of all of the somgs.
B0000025DV|4.0|an excellent album of rock/pop music with classical overtones. the group's leader, jeff lynne, is an extremely talented individual with an extraordinary sense for fine pop melodies. the classical overtones are more mozart, than say, stravinsky or mahler. the orchestra is always moving forward, elegantly, to a satisfying resolution on each song. the songs themselves are almost all fine, but my one gripe would be that this was a two record set, thus a looong cd, and the tempos of the songs are all fairly similar (upbeat, but not really hard rocking), thus towards the end it does seem that some editing could have been used, and the whole thing made just a tad shorter. small complaint though. i highly recomment this album. wonderful stuff.
0767803434|1.0|This is, quite possibly, the worst movie ever made. The utter absurdity of the premise is only outmatched by the absolute stupidity of the events that follow. In the realm of Hollywood movies about impossible things that miraculously happen with aircraft, this one deserves top awards. I give one star because you can't give zero, or negative stars. Beyond ridiculously abominable.
B000FIMG68|4.0|Really hated Anna-Lucia character, she adds nothing to the show. I had been rooting for Sayid and Shannon for a long time and then she gets killed! Sawyer is a great charater as well. Still an engrosing series and am anxious for the 3rd season to come out on DVD.

0002180618|4.0|The original One Minute Manager deals with the three \\"secrets\\" of good management: One Minute Goals, One Minute Praisings, and One Minute Reprimands.  I found this book well done but simplistic (apparently this manager does very little outside of the two hour staff meeting each week), which I guess is all one might expect from a breezy read that one could polish off in an hour or so.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I certainly would recommend it as reading to all managers.  And because of its short length, it is a book that a manager could reread every year.  The basic insights and principles are valid and should be considered by all thoughtful managers.  Certainly not the only management book you'll ever need, but a helpful supplement to your bookshelf.

B000MNP2KI|4.0|\\"Casino Royale\\" is the 21st movie in the James Bond franchise, and, for the first time since 1987's \\"The Living Daylights\\", it is based on one of Ian Fleming's novels. Loosely. The same book, the first of Fleming's Bond novels, inspired the 1967 spoof of the spy flick genre, also called \\"Casino Royale\\". I haven't seen that film, and it's been so long since I read Fleming's book that I barely remember it. But I can say that, in addition to moving the story beyond the Cold War and reinterpreting the Bond character, this film is more convoluted than the novel that inspired it. \\"Casino Royale\\" reinvents the James Bond franchise by moving away from the quasi-sci-fi, somewhat hokey technoterrorism of 2002's \\"Die Another Day\\" and toward a grittier world of death-defying hand-to-hand combat almost completely unaided by unusual gadgetry.<br /><br />Shortly after receiving his \\"00\\" status, or license to kill, British superspy James Bond (Daniel Craig) makes a spectacle of shooting up an embassy and an unarmed bombmaker in Madagascar. Annoyed by his politically embarrassing bravado and intent on cornering the banker to many of the world's terrorist organizations, a man called Le Chiffre, British spy chief \\"M\\" (Judi Dench) sets Bond lose to track down Le Chiffre's clients and create financial pressure that will force him to turn to MI6 for amnesty. This culminates in a high-stakes poker game in Montenegro, where Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen) must recoup his recent losses in order to cover his clients' investments. The British government sets Bond up with a $10 million stake, watched over by sharp, curvaceous treasury agent Vesper Lynd (Eva Green), with orders to clean Le Chiffre out.<br /><br />We won't know for sure until a few more Bond films have been produced, but \\"Casino Royale\\" appears to be a major turning point in the franchise. It has jettisoned \\"Q\\", Miss Moneypenny, and gadgets-to-the-rescue. Moreover, Daniel Craig's James Bond is a huge departure from previous interpretations. Where Sean Connery's Bond was a smug playboy, Roger Moore's effete, and Pierce Brosnan's politically correct, this new Bond is a sociopathic automaton. I'm not sure what this says about today's ideals. Bond is reckless as always. But he has more contempt than desire for women. He's an unquestioning soldier, not a stylish individualist. He acts as if he's been programmed, a relentless and unfeeling machine with the odd lapse into cloying sentimentality. His detachment is perversely captivating, but if Bond is going to be this dark, I might have preferred Clive Owen in the role.<br /><br />\\"Casino Royale\\" is an energetic and strangely seductive movie whose strength lies in its exoticism, immediacy, and careful pacing, not in Bond's charisma, action sequences, or Bond girls. The action sequences are the film's lows. A 9-minute chase goes past the point of dull and keeps on going. Adventures in Uganda, Madagascar, Nassau, and Miami that involve Le Chiffre's clients are tangential and cause the movie to run nearly 2 1/2 hours. They exist to provide eye candy and action at regular intervals. This works, but it complicates the plot to the extent that I must conclude that the plot does not matter. Le Chiffre seems to run a hedge fund for monied revolutionaries who manipulate stock prices with terrorist acts while he sells the stocks short. He is effectively an insider trader. Again, I'm not sure what this says about today's anxieties. \\"Casino Royale\\"'s plot, from its financial chicanery to its inscrutable and invisible villain \\"Mr. White\\", does not make sense. I can't excuse the sloppy writing, but \\"Casino Royale\\" is a pivotal Bond film with almost enough thrills and intrigue to entertain for its unprecedented 2 hour 24 minute running time.erpretations.

B0000AYL17|5.0|If you're a fan of Steely Dan's 1984 release, this album is for you.  Hail by most recording engineers as one of the best engineered albums (ever), the SACD version is certainly no exception.  The album, of course, features everybody from \\"The Don\\" and Walter Becker to Dire Straits' Mark Knopfler, Toto's Jeff Pocaro, and legendary studio drummer Steve Gadd. <br />If you're a surround sound enthusiast, this is the album for you.  DSD technology is fairly new (new enough that not many studios are equipped to deal with it).  It is completely different than it's PCM cousins in that it deals with a single bit rate with a 2.8 MHz sampling frequency.  You cannot tell the difference between DSD and analog tape.  Having said that, this technology is mostly used for archiving and restoration projects.  To give you a frquency comparison, the DVD-A version of this will only carry a 24-bit/96,000 PCM load, which is the highest that DVD-Audio can carry.  The compact disc can only carry 16-bit/44,1000.  You can surely see where I'm going with this.  With DSD, you get all the warmth and clarity of the analog tape without the hiss and the melting in your car. Spend a little extra money and buy the Hybird SACD.  You won't be sorry.
1582701709|3.0|I read this book partly because it was hyped and partly due to my curiosity about \\"the secret\\". While I think it's great that it helps people to think positively, I also agree with some of the other user reviews that it may give people a false hope that things will magically come true if they just think/wish about it. Yes, I agree that it is important to have faith and think positively, but in order to really acheive your goals, you need to put forth some effort on your part. For instance, the part of the book where Byrnes talks about weight loss- I found to be a little bit crazy. I maintain a healthy weight because I work for it- would I love to not wake up early every morning to work out? sure i would. But if i just sat around thinking/wishing about it, I wouldn't acheive any results. I also think its unfair to say that bad things happen to people because they wished to be in the wrong place in the wrong time, or that they didn't wish hard enough to not have their disease, etc.. so overall I have mixed feelings about the ideas of this book. Yes its great to think positively otherwise you will lead a miserable existence, but on the other hand, if we all sat around wishing for things without doing anything about it then where would we be?
B000MTPANQ|5.0|I've been totally immersed in Neil for a few months now. Mainly \\"On The Beach\\" and \\"Tonight's The Night\\". So when I read this was coming out I was more than excited, I actually tried to take the day off of work to run out, buy it, and listen to it. What's amazing is that Neil already has such history, we all have our favorite albums, we all have our opinions on \\"Harvest\\", and now \\"Massey Hall\\" changes everything. It should immediately jump into the pantheon of his best albums, no matter which ones are your favorites. Also, no matter what you think of \\"Harvest\\", love it or hate it this gives a new perspective on the album. If you've read \\"Shakey\\" like I am now you already know a lot of the details of his recording process during this time. But the songs here and the things Neil says between songs give us greater insight into \\"Harvest\\" and what he was thinking at the time. You realize that the songs would have been just as good as they're presented here. You realize that the songs only sound the way they do on \\"Harvest\\" basically just by happenstance. He happened to be going to Nashville to do the 'Johnny Cash Show\\" so he hooked up with some musicians there, and we was going to England to do a BBC show and added the London Symphony Orchestra. The sound quality is of course incredible. You can hear the echo in the Hall, Neil's voice reverberating beautifully throughout the place, you can feel Neil hitting those steel strings of his acoustic guitar with all his might on the rising chorus of \\"Old Man\\". The DVD is wonderful too. If you're a huge Neil fan like me any footage audio or visual from this era is incredible. Some have complained the concert footage is grainy and that the camera work is shaky, to me it's basically a documentary of the concert. It's interesting too to see the actual old man from \\"Old Man\\" as well. Any fan of good music should buy this immediately.
B00026WUAU|5.0|The first time I listened to this album, I was immediately put off by the female background singers. I thought they completely overpowered the music, and it sounded like it was the first time they had heard each song. They didn't sound tight at all, and I swear they sound out of key half the time. I don't mind gospel background singers at all, but I thought they made a mess out of every song they sang in. What's so good about people repeating what Bob just sang 2 seconds ago? They should reinforce the singing, not repeat it. I was fuming through every line. <br /> <br />The second time I listened to this album, I was suddenly floored by how great each and every song was written, and I started wondering if maybe there was a mix of this album without the background singers, because with them out of the way, this would be some of his best music for sure! The words were sharp, the music was tight, and his voice was great, and not just for Bob Dylan, his voice sounds as good as it did on Blonde on Blonde. <br /> <br />The third time I listened, I started blocking out the singers, because this was some really good music. I found myself already singing along to a good part of it, matching the somehow already familiar melodies. I knew this album would be one that I would go back to. <br /> <br />I still haven't gotten used to those background singers, and I probably never will. If there is in fact a remix of this album without the singers, I'd buy it in a second, because this is a great, great album with some of Bob's best songs ever. \\"Where Are You Tonight?\\" is one of my favorite Dylan songs, and as most other reviewers would note, \\"Changing of the Guard\\", \\"No Time to Think\\", and \\"Senor (Tales of Yankee Power)\\" are also highlights of the album. Just about every song is catchy and well-written, nothing worth skipping over. I would recommend it to any Bob Dylan fan, and suggest that they ignore the background singers as much as possible.
B000784WMW|2.0|After watching the recent version of Jane Eyre presented by Masterpiece Theatre, I was hooked on everything Jane Eyre!  I immediately read the book and then purchased and watched this version starring Timothy Dalton and Zelah Clarke.  After watching and immensely enjoying the Masterpiece Theatre version, this was just plain awful.  It is a multiple-episode TV version in which the acting and stage settings reminded me of a soap opera.  While I found it very truthful to the book, it lacked the wonderful acting, lush settings, beautiful music and cinematography of the Masterpiece Theatre version.  I watched it once and probably will never watch it again.  Invest in the Masterpiece Theatre version starring Toby Stephens and Ruth Wilson, you won't be sorry.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show was a discovery - first my husband and I saw Serenity on dvd, and enjoyed it so much that we bought this series dvd set.  We just devoured all the episodes one weekend, and were so disappointed to find that one season was all that was ever made.  All of the episodes in the set are fun, cleverly written, and well acted (Nathan Fillion is particularly fantastic!  If you loved Harrison Ford as the original Han Solo, think more old West and funnier, and you've got Fillion as Captain Mal.).  If you enjoy a good story, buy this set right now.  It's great for a first viewing, and you'll find yourself wanting to re-watch it again and again.  The only slight problem with this set is one of organization:  the episodes are not arranged chronologically on the dvds, so if you want to watch them in order of airing date, you may have to go from dvd to dvd instead of watching them straight through.  But even out of order, the episodes are each great, and I highly recommend this show.

B000I0RNV6|5.0|If you love movies, you have to see this movie,very sweet and all the characters are endearing.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|If you love James Bond movies, this quite possibly be the BEST of the lot. I know, Sean Connery is the only true James Bond. As a 007 purist, I thought the same thing until I saw this movie. Daniel Craig is fantastic, the villains are believable, the action is non-stop, the women are very hot without going over the top (i.e. once again --- believable not fashion models) and the dialogue is top shelf (many great one liners.) <br />See it and believe that this beats the others.
0060194995|5.0|After looking at many of the reviews for this book (not nearly all 1600+ however!) I hesitated to write because I mostly agree with many of the characterizations and high praise for \\"To Kill A Mockingbird\\" and praise for Harper Lee. I had to think about what I could possibly add to the mix - and I hope this review isn't too repetitious.<br /><br />I just finished re-reading the novel a few days ago (after nearly 40 years!) and am still feeling an emotionally charged afterglow. It is a combination of warm regard for the characters and a somewhat homesick yearning to return to the roots of the book - Maycomb, AL, and know the people better.<br /><br />As I thought about what might be affecting me so strongly it occurred to me that Harper Lee, I think, may have written a novel with character archetypes so strong and compelling that a person is wrapped up in it as if the story is their own. And not only that. Although the book has a great plot, story line, drama, suspense, mystery, social conscience, etc. It is really only about one thing. Love. It is written with love and it illustrates love in a world where those illustrations are like oases in a hot, dry desert.<br /><br />The character of Atticus Finch, for example, is an exemplary model of a loving father, neighbor, friend and shows this quality not only in the way he treats others, but even in the way he thinks about others. Yet, he also exhibits unquestionable strength and courage.<br /><br />I take away from this novel (and hope others will too) a model of behavior that I would like to emulate - or at least to aspire to.<br /><br />So, if you have a chance, drink this refreshing story and quench that thirst for knowledge of what it means to love. It is here.
B000M4RG42|5.0|Both highly factual and well paced action epic, this is the story behind the story of the taking of Iwo Jima. Clint Eastwood does it again in this exceptionally filmed and directed telling of the significance of the world famous flag raising photograph. If you love war movies, you will love this, if you love this, you must see the companion movie, \\"Letters of Iwo Jima\\" which might be a notch above this one --- also dirtected by Clint.
B00062ZE58|5.0|I have been craving this CD since May of last year when I first heard about it, and now that I finally got it, I can say this confidently. Within Temptation is for real! They are probably the BEST Symphonic Rock group I have ever heard my entire life! This is the only CD in my collection (of all my CDs) that I can listen it all the way through and do it again. The songs are THAT good! This CD earns a perfect rating of 5 out of 5.
B000001EGE|5.0|Like most other reviewers have said this is a great album.<br /><br />Although Rocket Man and Honky Cat were big singles, I actually prefer some of the album tracks. Mellow is a great gospel influenced track. Hercules is cracking rock 'n' roll song. Its a very happy album, and there isn't really a poor track on it.<br /><br />For me probably only beaten by Tumbleweed and Yellow Brick Road. Its probably also a good buy for anyone new to Elton's music as well, as there isn't the darkness of some of the earlier albums (which are very good as well but more of an aquired taste), or the sometimes overly MOR later albums.
0786838655|5.0|I just happened upon this book in a bookstore, and bought it for my 13 year-old son, who LOVES mythology. I decided to read it out loud to him, and my 11 year-old daughter insisted on getting in on the action.  And speaking of action, it starts right out with a BANG and never lets up. Percy IS my son...He is Harry Potter with an American flavor.  He also has ADHD and Dyslexia, which was such a surprise, and was so welcome in my house.  My son has ADHD, and finally found his hero.  (ADHD is all about those ancient survival skills.) Percy is intelligent, sensitive, loyal, funny, and has more courage than he ever realized.  This book is what my kids wait for EVERY NIGHT!!!  I've NEVER seen them so excited about a story. The use of mythology is just brilliant, and my son is constantly filling us all in about each of the gods and creatures, their powers, their stories...I could not recommend a better book for kids or adults! I've recommended it to my dearest friend, who is 6th Grade Core teacher, and my son's teacher, as well.  I truly think it would get Middle-Schoolers interested in Greek Mythology (they study it, but the reading material is soooo dry), and give them a fantastic, fun read at the same time.  My kids don't even want to watch TV anymore...it's all about The Lightning Thief!!!  We will be reading every sequel, and I'm thrilled! It just doesn't get much better than this!  It will keep their attention, and have them begging for more!! Thank you, Rick Riordan!! Keep them coming!!!
0312321376|2.0|Not a fan of reincarnation. Think it's a misinterpetation of the evidence we have for reincarnation. I don't think we need to worry about being sent back. I'm pretty well convinced that it's just a misinterpretation of the evidence on our part.  A made up story to try and explained a very complicated phenomena.   <br /> <br />I do believe that sometimes children, who haven't developed a strong sense of \\"self\\" might tune into the memories of long dead people, or hypnotized adults might have their own sense of \\"self\\" turned off and thus access memories of long since dead people.  Once children develop their own sense of \\"self\\" their minds quit tuning into other memories.  Once adults wake up from being hypnotized their own \\"self\\" filter tunes out memories that don't really belong to them.   As far as physical manifestations of reincarnation, I think that's simply an example of thoughts being things and consciousness creating reality, like in Dr. Fred Alan Wolf's book The Spiritual Universe.  It's all related to the holographic nature of reality, connectedness, oneness, etc.    <br /> <br />Marineboy said it best:  <br />\\"I suspect that it is a time-based misreading of \\"interconnection\\". Also, when people say they felt that \\"I\\" had all these past lives, I think the I is not the I they think it is, but the I of interconnection, the I of universal presence incarnating in myraid forms everywhere. Because there are no absolute boundaries to this \\"I\\" it seems in an nde as if it is THEY personally.\\"   <br />
B00005JLKN|4.0|PLOT: The film opens with a brief prologue in Baltimore, 1980. A Baltimore Symphony Orchestra concert is going on, and in the audience is none other than everyone's favorite cannibal, Dr. Hannibal Lecter (Anthony Hopkins). The first flautist, Benjamin Raspail, doesn't seem to be too talented and botches up quite a few notes. A week later, Lecter has the members of the Symphony Board over for a dinner party. One of them mentions the fact that Benjamin Raspail is missing and presumed dead. Lecter serves everyone a strange, yet delicious dish. When one of the board members asks what it is, he replies, \\"If I tell you, I'm afraid you won't even try it.\\" Later that night, FBI criminal profilist Will Graham (Edward Norton) shows up at Lecter's home. Graham and Lecter have been working together to track down serial killers for years. Graham thinks he has new evidence about an active serial killer dubbed the \\"Chesapeake Ripper\\". Graham noticed that all of the victim's lost some body part used in cooking. He believes that the Chesapeake Ripper is not keeping his souvenirs, he's eating them. Lecter asks Graham to come back in the morning so the two can revise their profile. He then leaves the room to get Graham's coat.Upon looking around at the object's in Lecter's office, Graham notices an antique medical book. Upon seeing Lecter's handwritten notes for \\"sweetbreads\\", Graham immediately knows that Lecter has been the Chesapeake Ripper all along. He turns around and gets stabbed in the abdomen by Lecter. Just as he is about to get killed, Graham stabs Lecter with a bundle of antique arrows. He then manages to fire a couple of shots into Lecter before the two lose consciousness. Years later, Graham (now retired and living in Florida) gets a visit from his old partner Jack Crawford (now played by Harvey Keitel). Crawford informs Graham that there is a new serial killer on the loose, dubbed as \\"The Tooth Fairy\\", and that he has already killed two families. He pleads with Graham to consider coming back to the FBI in hopes of trying to find the killer before he kills again. After careful consideration, Graham says goodbye to his wife Molly (Mary-Louise Parker) and son Josh and goes back to the FBI. Graham carefully studies the case file and sees that the Tooth Fairy killed both families in the exact same manner. He inserted mirror shards in their eyes after killing them and even left jagged bite marks on some of them (hence the nick-name). After reaching a dead end, Graham can't find any connection between the two families or why the Tooth Fairy chose to murder them. He decides to consult Dr. Lecter who now resides in solitary confinement in a maximum security facility; after all, Lecter did help Graham catch other serial killers early on in his career. Lecter decides to help Graham and looks at the case file. Graham knows that only Lecter can help him get in the mind of such a bizarre serial killer, but he hopes that he finds him before the next full moon, the only time the Tooth Fairy (Ralph Fiennes) strikes.<br /><br />COMMENTS: Brett Ratner's film adaptation of Thomas Harris's novel is not the first. It was originally made in 1986 under the title Manhunter. Now, thanks to Ratner, we can finally see Harris's original vision. Manhunter director Michael Mann changed around the story in his screenplay, and several elements of the story were either lost or watered down, including the titular sub-plot involving the Tooth Fairy's obession with the Red Dragon. Since Manhunter's release, two other films based on Harris's novels were released which firmly established Anthony Hopkins as Dr. Hannibal Lecter, so it was only natural that he play Lecter again in Ratner's film. Silence of the Lambs screenwriter Ted Tally returned to adapt the screenplay for Red Dragon. I especially liked the prologue at the beginning which shows how Will Graham captured Lecter, a scene which was actually absent from the novel. Tally also completely restored the sub-plotsinvolving the reasons for Francis Dolarhyde's (The Tooth Fairy) madness, as well as his obsession with the William Blake paintint \\"The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in the Sun.\\" Since this film takes place before The Silence of the Lambs, Rattner went to great efforts to make Hopkins appear younger. At one point he even considered digitally de-aging the actor, a technique he later used in his film X-Men: The Last Stand (2006). It brought back chills to once again see Lecter occupying the original cell from Silence. The Hannibal Lecter films starring Anthony Hopkins all seem to follow the same formula. All three were made by very different directors (Jonathan Demme for Silence of the Lambs, Ridley Scott for Hannibal) who in turn made three very unique moods for the films. Even though the films are part of a trilogy, they all work as stand alone films as well. You don't need to watch them in any particular order to know what is going on. Sometimes I watch the films in release date order and sometimes I watch them in chronological order; it doesn't really matter. The film itself features an all-star ensemble cast. I thought that Harvey Keitel as Jack Crawford was a good replacement for Silence's Scott Glenn. Lecter's nemesis Dr. Chilton (played by Anthony Heald) makes a return from Silence, as does Barney Matthews (played by Frankie Faison) from Silence and Hannibal. The character of Barney Matthews actually doesn't appear in the novel, but Ted Tally felt that it would only make sense that he be in the film. Ralph Fiennes gave a very creepy performance as Francis Dolarhyde; not necessarily better than Tom Noonan's in Manhunter, but different. Tally also restored Harris's original ending for the film. He even added an epilogue which sets up the film for the events in The Silence of the Lambs. Overall I think that the film is a much more faithful film than Michael Mann's Manhunter. After this film was released, Hopkins announced that he would never be portraying the character of Dr. Hannibal Lecter again. Harris wrote a prequel novel, entitled Hannibal Rising, in 2006. The novel chronicles the life of the young Hannibal Lecter. A film adaptation was released in early 2007, but unfortunately Hopkins refused to appear in the film for a brief cameo or even a voice narrative.

At one point he even considered digitally de-aging the actor, a technique he later used in his film X-Men: The Last Stand (2006). It brought back chills to once again see Lecter occupying the original cell from Silence. The Hannibal Lecter films starring Anthony Hopkins all seem to follow the same formula. All three were made by very different directors (Jonathan Demme for Silence of the Lambs, Ridley Scott for Hannibal) who in turn made three very unique moods for the films. Even though the films are part of a trilogy, they all work as stand alone films as well. You don't need to watch them in any particular order to know what is going on. Sometimes I watch the films in release date order and sometimes I watch them in chronological order; it doesn't really matter. The film itself features an all-star ensemble cast. I thought that Harvey Keitel as Jack Crawford was a good replacement for Silence's Scott Glenn. Lecter's nemesis Dr. Chilton (played by Anthony Heald) makes a return from Silence, as does Barney Matthews (played by Frankie Faison) from Silence and Hannibal. The character of Barney Matthews actually doesn't appear in the novel, but Ted Tally felt that it would only make sense that he be in the film. Ralph Fiennes gave a very creepy performance as Francis Dolarhyde; not necessarily better than Tom Noonan's in Manhunter, but different. Tally also restored Harris's original ending for the film. He even added an epilogue which sets up the film for the events in The Silence of the Lambs. Overall I think that the film is a much more faithful film than Michael Mann's Manhunter. After this film was released, Hopkins announced that he would never beportraying the character of Dr. Hannibal Lecter again. Harris wrote a prequel novel, entitled Hannibal Rising, in 2006. The novel chronicles the life of the young Hannibal Lecter. A film adaptation was released in early 2007, but unfortunately Hopkins refused to appear in the film for a brief cameo or even a voice narrative. This DVD features the film in the original theatrical widescreen ratio. It is loaded with special features including a Making Of documentary, Commentary by Brett Ratner and Ted Tally, Hannibal Lecter's FBI Case File, The Life History of Hannibal Lecter, and much more.
0307346609|2.0|i got the zombie survival guide and found it to be extremely interesting. so i got world war z for my birthday. needless to say i was disapointed. the book itself barely even touches on the fact that the zombies attacked. the entire begining is about illegal immigrants coming out of china. WHO CARES!!! i wanted to read about people getting eaten and killing zombies, not the business aspects if the asian government. overall not a good read.

B00003W8NM|5.0|This is a fantastic movie!  Fight Club is a mean, dirty, bloody journey into the psyche of men in the modern world.  I won't even get too much involved in the plot, which is surreal and not without its share of twists and turns. A lot of what this movie is about is these frustrated emotionally-numb men realizing that the world we all live in (9-5 jobs, wives, kids, IKEA, Starbucks...) has robbed them of thier ability to feel anything, along with any dreams they once had.  They connect to their primal rage in some of the most awesomely graphic bare knuckle fighting you'll see in a movie...Fight Club. Once they start the club they open a whole can of worms; the fighting almost becomes addictive, and they eventually begin to look at the world like a pack of wolves watching a herd of sheep.   <br /> <br />There is a whole mess more going on in the movie that I'll leave for you to get to yourself; sex, violence, morals, insanity, space monkeys and making soap to name a few. I've been a solid fan of both Norton and Pitt since they made this flick and it sits as kind of a perfect little treasure out of the late nineties.  For those of you who have never seen it, give it a whirl if you can handle some bloody fist fighting.  If you haven't seen it in a few years I recommend you watch it again; remind yourself why you liked so much the first time.
B000IHY9SE|3.0|Man this album is a let down. I knew it was a mixtape but I thought there shoulda been a little more Eminem on here. The best rappers on this CD are Em, 50 and Obie Trice. Everyone else blows. Proof wasn't bad, but he had one short track, no disrespect to Proof. I'm sorry. I guess it's just that, not that they're neccessarily terrible, but Cashis, Bobby Creekwater and Stat Quo are all doing nothing. They're nothing special. I don't kow why, but it seems like ever since G-Unit came alone, Em and Shady records have been coasting. Even in songs where they try to bring across energy, it sounds forced. Manufactured. The only songs I really bumped on this CD were You Don't Know, Pistol Pistol Remix and NO APOLOGIES. THAT song blows every other one on here OUT OF THE WATER! I pray to GOD there's more of this in Eminem and he puts out another CD. He has to. All I'm asking for is one more album Shady. Doesn't even have to be neccessarily better or as good as the Marshall Mathers LP, just make it on par with Eminem Show and Slim Shady LP. Anyway, yeah thats about it. Bobby Creekwater, Cashis, Stat Quo and D-12 are all average at best. Why did Eminem surround himself with so many lackluster emcees? They probably killed him.
B000063DGC|5.0|This \\"Tribute\\" cd to the late, great Randall \\"Randy\\" Rhoads is mostly compiled from a concert at Cleveland, Ohio on May 11, 1981. The other band members besides Messrs. Osbourne and Rhoads are drummer Tommy Aldrige (ex-Black Oak Arkansas & Pat Travers) and bassist Rudy Sarzo (Randy's former band-mate in Quiet Riot).  Aldrige and Sarzo replaced Lee Kerslake and Bob Daisley, who were both fired two days after recording the [[ASIN:B004RQVVGU Diary Of A Madman (Legacy Edition)]] album. Bob Daisley was highly influential in helping Ozzy with his solo career as he wrote the lyrics to most of the songs on Ozzy's first two albums [[ASIN:B004DL5K2K Blizzard Of Ozz (Expanded Edition)]] & [[ASIN:B004RQVVGU Diary Of A Madman (Legacy Edition)]]).<br />Anyway, this live cd capturing the brilliance of guitarist Randy Rhoads, truly is a fantastic tribute as it shows a rare glimpse of the phenomenal playing and improvising of Randy. The concert begins with the background music of the most famous movement from Carl Orff's Carmina Burana cantata, \\"O Fortuna\\". Ozzy asks the energetic crowd, \\"Are you ready to rock-n-roll?\\" The crowd roars and Ozzy tells them, \\"You're beautiful!\\" As \\"O Fortuna\\" nears climax, Ozzy yells to the audience, \\"Rock-n-roll!\\" Randy then rips into the opening chords of \\"I Don't Know\\" and the energy hits the roof! Ozzy and Randy proceed to blaze through \\"Crazy Train\\", \\"Believer\\" and \\"Mr. Crowley\\". Each song delivered with the intensity of.......well, Randy Rhoads! Randy re-invents his solos on each tune, adding incredibly fast trills and progressions to the songs. You can tell that every fiber of his being was flowing into his guitar and coming forth as divine music. The live renditions of these classic songs allow us to hear/feel the thought process and infinite energy flowing from Randy, and they are also the definitive versions of each tune.<br /> \\"Flying High Again\\" has Ozzy telling the raucous audience to \\"keep on smokin' them joints!\\"  Randy then proceeds to put his stamp on this tune with guitar playing that is beyond words (in a good way). Alright now! This rendition blows away the album version! Randy takes over and delivers the goods! \\"Suicide Solution\\" is another song where Randy really cuts loose. Randy's guitar solo at the end of the tune was actually recorded at another show (Montreal, Canada, 7/28/81), and spliced onto the end of the track. Randy plays three Black Sabbath songs and proceeds to take each tune to another level previously thought unattainable. The final two numbers were recorded during Ozzy's UK \\"Blizzard\\" tour when the previously mentioned Daisley and Kerslake were still in the band.<br />The cd ends with Randy's studio takes of his instrumental number \\"Dee\\".<br />There is not much more to say other than if you are looking to hear one of the greatest guitarist at the peak of creativity, and if you enjoy soulful music (if you know what I mean), then you should by all means get this cd.<br />Randy died March 19, 1982, in Leesburg, Florida. A small plane crashed after \\"buzzing\\" Ozzy's tour bus three times, on the forth time, the plane's wing clipped the bus causing the plane to pinwheel into a mansion and burst into flames. The crash killed guitarist Randall Rhoads, 25, the pilot of the Beechcraft Bonanza - Andrew Aycock, 36 - and Rachel Youngblood, 58, the group's makeup artist and hairdresser. The plane's pilot was also the group's bus driver.<br />Randy may be physically gone but his spirit is eternal!<br />The lyrics to the final stanza of\\"O Fortuna\\" are as follows:<br />Fate is against me<br />in health<br />and virtue,<br />driven on and weighted down,<br />always enslaved.<br />So at this hour<br />without delay<br />pluck the vibrating strings;<br />since Fate strikes down the string man,<br />everybody weep with me!stamp on this tune with guitar playing that is beyond words (in a good way).

B000MTPANQ|5.0|This album, more than many other Neil albums, should extinguish the flame that is people who say that Neil Young \\"doesn't have a good voice.\\"  I've heard the same about Bob Dylan and Tom Petty as well.  They may not have huge range in their voices or what some might call a \\"classic\\" voice, but nonetheless their voices and only THEIR voices are what fits best with the music. <br /> <br />Now, on to the album.  It is very hard to believe that this album was recorded more than 3 and a half decades ago...if you were to tell me that it was recorded just last night I would not call you a liar!  The sound quality is absolutely perfect, which surprises me for something recorded so long ago.  Neil's voice is at its absolute pinnacle, and the acoustic guitars he uses sound as perfect as any I've heard before.   <br /> <br />However, there is one downside to listening to this album - it makes me wish I was there!  I think I would faint in ecstasy if I went to a show of his that opened with \\"On The Way Home\\" and closed with \\"I Am A Child.\\"   <br /> <br />It just doesn't get any better than that.
B0007Y08QA|4.0|Christian Bale plays the part of an operator, not a machinist. <br />Just thought I'd clear that up for anyone who has seen or will see <br />this movie. I enjoyed the movie. I feel so tired....
0823016714|5.0|Wow! No need to pose family and friends for facial expressions. <br />This book is a great idea. <br />No more excuses, just find the mood (expression) you need and start drawing. <br />Thanks!
B000GCFO08|2.0|This DVD will not become worn out - as least not at my house.  The plot was tangled nearly beyond repair and it did not give me the thrills that I desire from a \\"scary\\" movie.  Admittedly, I am not a blood and guts fan but I expect a good story line that does not challenge my ability to put the pieces together.  And disgust does not replace a good old-fashioned shriek of fright.  I was disappointed.
B000EQ47GS|5.0|Need anyone say more?  As a music lover I always wait for that next beautiful heartfelt song.  It breaks my heart, LITERALLY, to lose a musician who's provided me with so many hours & hours & hours of listening pleasure.   <br />--Well you're climbing to the top of the company ladder <br />--Hope it doesn't take too long <br />--Can't you see they'll come a day when it won't matter <br />--Come a day when \\"you'll be gone\\" <br />Maybe all he wanted was to  have his \\"peace of mind\\". <br />  long-time Boston fan (no pun intended) <br />   Melanie in Alaska <br />
B0009K8L5W|5.0|Shakira has a wonderful emotion in this album. Her voice is just a joy to listen to, whether you speak Spanish or not. I loved the mix of various beats in her her music. It's hard to pick a favorite song from this album, but especially love Antologia and un Poco de Amor.

B0000041DF|2.0|I have the utmost respect for Argerich both as a pianist and as an artist. As talented and gifted as she is, it's her sense of engagement and commitment that never fails to elicit admiration and awe in me. Her readings are so overwhelming and passionate that one often gets the impression that her life is dependent on whatever she happens to be playing. On the right day, she's able to draw the most riveting and powerful sounds from the piano and conjure up the deepest and strongest feelings that one can experience by listening to a piece of music. More often than not, however, haste and anxiety get the best of her and what was intended to be an engaging performance ends up being a chaotic and incomprehensible gathering of notes. Therein lies the main problem with her rendition of Rachmaninov's third piano concerto: it lacks structural integrity and the blurred articulation often results in missing, indistinct or simply wrong notes. She fares better in Tchaikovsky's first piano concerto, though not so much so as to avoid the aforementioned shortcomings. Definitely not a good buy. Hyperion has recently released a wonderful live performance by Stephen Hough of the four Rachmaninov's piano concertos. The sound is pristine and the playing is top quality. This recording is to be preferred over Argerich's.
6304698682|5.0|A good western starring Clint Eastwood released in 1985 bringing a more developed plot variation of \\"High Plains Drifter\\" released several years before.  The film benefits from a good screenplay and script in which there are more well developed characters to keep the audience interested.    The film is set in a small mining town where independent miners are terrorized by the boss who owns the mine and adjacent town.  Clint Eastwood rides into town as \\"The Preacher\\" and sides with the beleaguered miners against the local boss.  The film remains mysterious as to whether \\"The Preacher\\" is really a man or a ghostly apparition from the past coming to claim revenge for past misdeeds.  The town boss eventually hires a crooked Marshall and his posse to take care of The Preacher and there seems to be a past connecting them together.  The Preacher almost leads one to think that he was the main character in \\"Hang 'Em High\\" because of the noose mark on his neck that he hides with a scarf.      This is certainly one of Eastwood's better westerns that has a good plot and extensive character development.  The film also has a certain element of the supernatural as no one knows exactly whether Eastwood's character is a living man or an avenging ghost coming out of the past.  Overall an excellent film worth renting or owning.
0743298020|3.0|I didn't enjoy this book as may other's have.  While reading the first half of it I was reminded of reading Rose Red, which was a little bizarre for my taste.  The second half of the book got better but I certainly would not rate this high on my favorite book list.  I was not left with the feeling of wanting more, I was more looking forward to starting my new book.  I was hoping for more from this book than what I got out of it.
0783225725|1.0|Apart from starring in a musical, this is probably the worst western Clint Eastwood has ever done in his career.  Although it tries to achieve a lofty theme of revenge and justice, it simply falls flat on its face with a flat screenplay, a  minimal script, and simply terrible acting.  This is the kind of film you want to drift through at 4:00 am on your TV set when you have nothing better to do.  A film in which a tumbleweed drifting on the desert floor in the high wind has more development than the story or the characters.    Clint Eastwood is a nameless drifter known simply \\"the Stranger\\" who happens to ride into the desolate town of Lagos.  Brutalized by a band of thugs, he returns to the town unrecognized to exact an obligation from the cowardly inhabitants who left him to be beaten and take revenge on his attackers. He obtains the help of a marginalized local dwarf (Billy Curtis) to rally the inhabitants and repaint the town red with the new name of \\"Hell.\\"  \\"Hell\\" is what you will feel like as you plod through this boring film and its mundane plot.  The poor filming and simply atrocious acting by everyone involved will add to the feeling of infernal damnation.    I am a big Clint Eastwood fan but this western is simply bad and unworthy of either rental or purchase.  Clint simply has better things available to watch such as Leone's films, 'Hang 'Em High', \\"The Outlaw Josey Wales\\", etc.  You won't miss a thing by not watching this film.
B000MNP2KI|5.0|Daniel Craig is Bond.  The character is different from the sauve sophistication of the early years, the laughing of the middle years, or the more recent days of Pierce Brosnan.  Craig is about action, and lots of it.  Craig can also share the screen well.  Yes, this Bond film has a love story in its midst, but one cannot come to expect that in future fears (whether that is good or bad, I leave to you).  The chase scene in the construction yard is among the best I've seen; M's character is played brilliantly by Dame Judi Dench - a dramatically powerful actress; and Eva Green greatly exceeds the intellect and romance of past Bond girls while holding her own in a role competing with 007.  While the technological wiz-bang stuff of past films make an occasional appearance, its absence is refreshing.  This Bond is about muscle, force, and measured calculations of employing both to effect an end.  Kill a traitor?  No problem.  Eliminate a bomber?  Piece of cake.  On the other hand, if you're looking for a kindler, gentler Bond now that the cold war is over, look again.  There is no cold war in this movie, not in the least bit, and the movie couldn't be hotter because of it.  Go see it, and enjoy.
B000LXHK2C|4.0|I saw this film in the theater and now own it because I admire Russell Crowe's work.  I own several of his films.  As always, he is excellent in the part.  Here the story is light and amusing.
B00008BRB5|5.0|The Police don't need any introduction and I doubt this album does either. I had it on (very worn) vinyl for years but finally decided to upgrade to CD. In light of their recent announcement of a reunion tour, it may not be long before this becomes harder to find and/or more expensive than it is at the moment. It's great rock music delivered in the way only The Police know how but it's also classic 80s pop.<br /><br />My favourite tunes are \\"Every Breath You Take\\", \\"Synchronicity II\\" (I absolutely loved the video!), \\"Tea In The Sahara\\" and \\"Wrapped Around Your Finger\\" but it's a great CD all round. Even back then, it was easy to see that Sting would become the megastar that he eventually did. I hope the reunion works out. I'd pay good money to see these guys play live.
B000KC86F4|3.0|The 1st and 2nd X-Men movie is really good. I am not sure about this one. But after I watched it my self, oh, maybe it is better if this movie haven't being produced yet. <br /> <br />The storyline is poor, just rely on big special effects without clear and strong plot to make the audience go \\"wow\\" like they did with the 1st or 2nd. <br /> <br />I prefer not buying it, but if you already have the 1st and 2nd dvd collection, might interesting to get it too. Just so you can complete the collection.

B00006CXSS|5.0|This is the best war movie I have ever seen. I was stationed in the Pacific Theatre during World War II, so I was not an eye witness to events in Europe. My knowledge of the war in Europe was learned from several books on the subject. Band of Brothers is a terrific story of a horrendous time in the lives of the paratroopers of E Company.
B000A0GP4K|5.0|You don't have to be a Dylanologist or even a generational fellow traveler (though it doesn't hurt) to be completely captivated by Martin Scorcese's 200 min. documentary of the magnetic early career of the legendary artist.  With a carefully textured combination of archival footage- some never seen before- and contemporary interviews, including a revealing and engaging running commentary by the notoriously elusive subject himself, Scorsese portrays in fascinating detail the unlikely and uncanny transformation of the small town Bobby Zimmerman into the daemonic lyrical genius whose clairvoyant creative fusion with the nascent Sixties' zeitgeist shaped and catalyzed a momentous cultural tipping point like no other artist of his time.  It is a great story told by a master story teller. <br /> <br />For me, however, the ultimate achievement of this film goes beyond its vivid portrait of a mythic young artist.  It is the nagging and even haunting question that the film eventually leaves us with; the indecipherable mystery- in plain sight- of Dylan himself. <br /> <br />The genius of Scorcese is what he is able to show us. That there is such a thing as an artistic charismatic; that there are larger than life phantoms who appear seemingly out of nowhere, whose mesmerizing, mercurial incandescence can manifest a preternatural subjectivity so intense and at the same time so permeable they are able, in the swirling ebb and flow of their creativity, to transfigure themselves over and over again at will.  In doing so they are able to bring their art to a white hot heat that galvanizes and transfigures the imagination of almost everybody it touches, and, after the fire has subsided, leaves an indelible stamp that even they do not understand. <br />
0064430227|5.0|When I was small, I LOVED this book. I had to own it again for memories sake. I put it on my christmas list and THANKFULLY I got it. This book really takes your child on an adventure. Harold makes up these wonderful stories and brings them to life using his one big purple crayon. The illustrations are simple but SO enjoyable. This book is a great read for children and can be enjoyed by any age. I HIGHLY reccomend this book and any book from the harold series. AND HOLD ON TO IT. I guarantee that any child who reads this book will remember it as a lifetime favorite and would love to read it to their children someday. I know this will ALWAYS be MY favorite. I inside the cover of my christmas gift of harold and the purple crayon my mother wrote: MAY THE CHILD IN YOU ALWAYS HAVE A PURPLE CRAYON AT HAND TO DRAW WHATEVER YOU CANT FIND. and that is just what harold does.

0140277447|5.0|On Dec. 13, 1937, a small, modern Japanese army vanquished a much larger rabble of Chinese soldiers and entered the capital of China, Nanking. Then began a carnage of murder, rape, arson and theft such as the world had not known for five centuries -- since Tamurlane sacked Delhi. <br />The killing went on unchecked for about eight weeks, slowing down only when the Japanese began to run out of Chinese. <br />Most historians believe the number of killed was around 300,000. If that is correct, then people were murdered faster in Nanking than at Auschwitz at its busiest. <br />The Nazis tried to keep their Final Solution obscure. According to Iris Chang, the Japanese reveled in their crimes -- at least for the first few days. <br />After that, journalists' accounts created worldwide disgust. The Japanese did not stop killing, but they did shut off Nanking from the outside world. <br />Still there, however, were about two dozen European and American businessmen, doctors, missionaries and teachers. Even before the break-in, they had declared an \\"International Safety Zone\\" in the part of the city where the foreign schools, hospitals and businesses were. <br />The Japanese did not recognize the safety zone and continually stage raids into it to kidnap girls for rape and young men for murder. But they were fearful enough of world opinion that the handful of \\"white devils\\" were able to save 300,000 Chinese, mostly civilians but some ex-soldiers. <br />In other words, says Chang, the devoted foreigners saved almost everybody in the zone, and the raging Japanese killed almost everyone outside it. (Their killing field included the whole province, but \\"Rape of Nanking\\" has nothing about what went on in the countryside -- a photograph says the whites set up a rural safety zone, but the text does not even mention where it was or how many people came in.)  <br />Japanese ultranationalists still deny that anything happened or blame \\"Chinese bandits.\\" <br />These lies are contradictedby Japanese newspapers of the time, which covered the killing as a sport -- which, says Chang, it was for the Japanese. Two sub-lieutenants started a contest to see which could chop off a hundred Chinese heads first. Japanese newspapers, including the biggest and also the English-language Japan Advertiser, followed the officers' score like a baseball pennant race. <br />Those two were executed after the war, but very few of the other 20,000 murderers were inconvenienced in any way. <br />Though the Rape of Nanking was an international sensation at the time, and continued to be publicized for more than a year through such powerful voices as the Reader's Digest, it has receded from public memory -- by suppression in Japan, by competing issues elsewhere. <br />Histories of the Pacific War in English usually consider the conflict started in 1941. Chang correctly -- and for the first time I have ever seen in print -- says the conflict began in 1894 with Japan's first invasion of China. <br />This scuttles the Japanese ultranationalist claim that the 1941-45 war was defensive against western imperialism. And the fact that the Japanese army held its men back from overrunning the International Safety Zone gives the lie to claims that the behavior of the Imperial Army was \\"no worse\\" than the \\"excesses\\" that occur in any war. <br />It is clear from Chang's account that the Japanese government, as well as the military, deliberately set out to cow the Chinese by a policy of terror and extermination. <br />Verifiable accounts reveal tortures that \\"almost surpass the limits of human comprehension.\\" Photographs in this book are the most gruesome I have ever seen in a respectable book. The famous pictures from Dachau that revolted the world in 1945 are tame by comparison. <br />Chang makes one demand and asks one question. <br />The demand is for compensation for the few remaining victims. The question is, how can men be directed to behave as the Japanese soldiers did? <br />
0307237699|4.0|I've been on a bit of a Barack kick with my political research as of late. I accidentally wandered onto his Selma speech on C-Span last Sunday, and as someone who is fascinated by 60s political history and LBJ, it's been eerie seeing the role Barack is starting to take within the democratic party.<br /><br />In a lot of ways, Barack has been saddled with healing many of the wounds left from the assassinations of Kennedy and King. On the Kennedy side, he represents that dashing, charismatic outsider [Kennedy Catholic; Barack interracial]. On the King side, he represents a potential Black Leader who is comfortable engaging with mainstream American in pragmatic, yet prophetic terms. In Audacity of Hope, Barack begins to set the table for the tone of the dialog he would like to engage in as a presidential candidate.<br /><br />He strikes the right note with the stories and autobiographical details that he shares. When it comes to international relations, he puts readers at ease when he shares his own personal narrative as an American child growing up in Indonesia. When it comes to the politics of race, he shares his great admiration for \\"Mac\\", a business owner committed to hiring ex-felons for his restaurant. When it comes to his political credentials, he skillfully shows an authentic empathy for the blue-collar and rural constituents that he represents in Illinois. And there are frequent moments when we get to experience just what it is like talking to the lions of the Senate or traveling on the plane to visit Iraq.<br /><br />I find it hard to see how anyone can read this book and like Barack as a person less than when they started it.

B000J3EEBY|5.0|I check periodically to see if Loreena has released anything new.  Imagine my surprise when I accidently ran into this CD while trying to find something by Patrick Cassidy the Irish composer.  Anyway, I sampled each track and knew I was in for more of Loreena's greatness.  Someone wrote that this CD picked up exactly where Book of Secrets left off.  It seems to me that she made a trilogy, starting with The Mask and Mirror.  Considering how much I enjoy her work, I was elated to continue the ethereal journey and all of its \\"odd\\" instrumentation.  It's a great addition to my collection, and I plan on getting a lot of usage from it.
B000002L7R|5.0|For all of the earthshattering impact that Purple Rain had on the popular music universe, Around the World in a Day seems to be the Prince album that means the most to me these days. \\"Condition of the Heart\\" is really the core of the album for me. We have the Indian influenced title track and then the Beatles-inspired \\"Paisley Park\\" and \\"Condition of the Heart\\" just changes everything up totally. I've had some deep conversations with a good musical friend about this track and what it means and how the operatic quality of it totally meshes with the lyrical content. It's saddening and deep and meaningful and helps hyperintellectual cats like myself find connection with the sadness and blues and Spirits that we wrestle with when we meditate on the frustrations of love.<br /><br />And the rest of the album is pretty good too. \\"Tambourine\\" is an oft-overlooked track, but it hangs will with future spare funk jams like \\"Housequake\\". \\"Pop Life\\" and \\"Raspberry Beret\\" are the two killer singles. \\"America\\" is really filler to me and stuff like \\"Partyup\\" on \\"Dirty Mind\\" puts it to shame.<br /><br />This album is not as airtight as \\"Purple Rain\\" from a pop perspective. But  Prince showed a lot of audacity going for a sound like this after The Industry expected him to just keep cranking out singles like Michael Jackson went \\"Bad\\" after \\"Thriller\\".<br /><br />And to think in one of my previous musical philosophical incarnations I though Prince was profane and I couldn't dig it...<br /><br />Ashamed to think about that looking back....<br /><br />5 stars<br /><br />--SD
B000F0UV0E|5.0|I've always like these two performers, and it was great that they collaborated on this effort.  One critic mentioned that the CD had no particularly outstanding tracks.  Well, no one song jumped out in my face.  If I want \\"in my face\\" music, I've got everything Metallica for that.  Actually, I'm sure that was a simple referral to having no single song standing out as better than all the others.  That's okay with me.  This is a very good, sweet and consistent set of music featuring two excellent singers.  I noticed that \\"Rollin' On\\" reminded me of Emmylou's \\"All My Tears\\" on her Wrecking Ball album.  Of course, Mark's unique guitar work bore strong resemblance to his Dire Straits days (I have all that, too).  I was far from disappointed and will be listening to this CD many times in the future.
B00069A5GE|5.0|Sailing to Philadelphia is some of Mark Knopfler's best work.  Can't hear enough of this CD, absolutely superb.  Congrats, Mark.  You're the best guitarist bar none, an unbelievably talented musician!
B000MGUZM0|1.0|If you liked the uniqueness and energy present and welcome in their first CD \\"Funeral\\", then you are in for a surprise. This has to be the most boring, repetitive, mirthless, disappointing piece of garbage I have ever heard. While some tracks sound like they are being performed from the bottom of a well (or maybe from a hole directly connected to the underworld, I am not sure), other tracks sound like the instruments are being played by trained performing monkeys, who only know three chords. The subject matter is never funny, never fun, never smart; it is dull and depressing and basically trying too hard to be different, from the very beginning up to the very end. Reselling on Ebay? You betcha.
1577314808|5.0|The Power of Now teaches the importance of living here... and now... Life is a gift... that is why we MUST learn to live in the present. The message by the author, Ekhart Tolle is simple; if we learn to live each day at a time, we find the path to happiness and enlightenment. If we concentrate on the gift that each day of life represents, our thoughts and emotions would not get in the way of living in genuine peace and happiness. Sincerely recommend the reading of this book for anyone and everyone in search of the right and the obligation of aspiring to be happy. Other cultures live their lives without so much concentration on the worry of tomorrow. They live each eay at the time, guided by the forces at play that surround them, just like the ancient navigators allowed themselves to be guided by the stars. The identity of each individual is manifested by the moment they are living, rather than who they were... or whom they aspire to become. The author challenges us to understand that  our concern with anything else but our present lives, fills us with stress because our minds attempt to control the events that surround us, and that is just not possible. Introspective exercises are offered... and while we may not agree, or be capable of change, the thinking process does indeed get challenged enough for an indepth analysis of our lives.

It is also fun to see the ones they give you that you may not realize at first glance, but when you read the profile and think about it you see the traits stand out. <br /> <br />This book has helped me understand why I enjoy certain aspects of my job, and why I hate others.  It has also assisted me in considering positions - do the tasks and responsibilities of the position fit with my strengths? <br /> <br />I have received so much benefit, and growth from this book that I have given it as gifts for family and friends.
B000031WD9|5.0|Well I had all the other movies, but this makes my collection complete.  This is the kind of movie you can watch over and over again and it never gets boring.
B000NA28HU|5.0|First, I have to say that I have not read the book.  I had just started reading it when I learned that they were making it into a movie.  I learned a long time ago to always see the movie first because, in my experience, the book is always better than the movie.    With that said, I truly thought this was a wonderful movie.  There is so much [...] out there, that anything that can be considered a \\"family\\" movie should be heralded!!    However, after watching the movie, it makes me want to go back and read the book.  I am aware that there is a lot that the movie doesn't cover.    So to me, this is a total win-win situation:  the movie was wonderful and enjoyable; and it makes me want to read the book to see what the movie left out.     I hope people realize that the bad reviews for this movie are primarily coming from people who had already read the book and were disappointed.  Don't let the bad reviews deter you from seeing a great movie!
B000H0MKGK|5.0|Since first hearing John Mayer several years back, I have become almost obsessed with all of his songs, especially his lyrics and phrasing---I find both almost hypnotic as I listen and relisten to this new CD--in many ways far superior to his first in it entirety. Just when I get comfortable with a song, and his style, I am surprised by either a change in tempo and or orchestration--and his lyrics to me are almost as good as Bob Dylan's--that's maybe why I like him so much--the subtle ranges of his musical delivery when coupled with his lyrics take me to places Dylan has in the past. I find myself singing his songs all day and leaving the cd in the car player for days--and I do not skip around, I let the CD go from beginning  to end.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|Perfect movie for any random mood, one of the first and best movies where the charmingly befuddled Hugh Grant acts like a total jerk and yet you still love him.
0743298020|4.0|I don't know how I came to own this book.  I don't think I purchased it, because Victorian style novels have never been my favorite genre.  That having been said, I found the book acceptably entertaining and suspect that those that do enjoy such novels will enjoy it even more.<br /><br />This is by and large a story of the psychological and emotional attraction between siblings and more particularly twins.  With this backdrop, the author creates an intriguing mystery which, though dragging somewhat through the middle of the story picks up speed and finishes strongly over the final 100 pages.<br /><br />It was really a three star experience for me.  Fans of the genre will give it five, hence my final rating of four stars.  There were sections of the story that strained credibility, but over all, a well written engaging story.
B00005JMFQ|5.0|Pretty much the pinnacle of Americanized British comedies, and a great all around feel giddy movie- especially during the holidays.
B0006GAOBI|5.0|I am obsessed with Donnie Darko and so I bought both versions.  The theatrical version is basically the same thing except with some words changed and some scenes taken out and left in deleted scenes.  The director's cut is much better. <br />If you haven't seen either version ever, I suggest buying this.  There are those movies that you rent and then are done with, but this is one you will want to watch over and over again.
0385474547|5.0|I was taken back how Things Fall Apart detailed the life of Igbo people. Usually a fiction book doesn't paint such a historically vivid picture. I think that's what makes the book so special. Besides the intriguing plot, there's so much one can learn about the African culture just by reading this book. However there's a learning curve. Achebe utilizes the diction of the Igbo people in order to make the story less `fictional'. Things Fall Apart is divided into three parts. The first part sets up the backdrop of the story (the customs, people, main characters, etc). The second part center's around Okonkwo's life outside the tribe. And the Three part deals with the coming of the Christian missionaries (white man), and the `conversion' of the Igbo peoples to Christianity.    This book fills in some of the missing history of the colonization of Africa.
0930289234|5.0|This classic comic book seamlessly blends the literary within the comic form.  I hate it when people say it shows the potential for comics as great literature, because it quite simply is great literature.  It discusses themes which are best described with the comic form, highly dramatic moral values and extremes.  I think this comic should become a must-read for basic cultural knowledge.  That it isn't even more widely read is reprehensible.
B00005JPFQ|5.0|I saw this movie and think it was great. <br />Nicholas Cage is perfect for the part and I was entertained throughout the whole movie, I am buying a copy as soon as it comes out on DVD. <br />Don't take movies too seriously and start criticising them, after all it is only a movie and fantasy!  <br />Great movie, I recommend it.
B000MRA5NS|4.0|My setup is a panasonic LCD projection PT-56LCX66 (1080i). I use a Sony PS3 as my bluray player with an HDMI connection to the TV for video and I use optical from the PS3 to my sony reciever (STR-DG800) for audio. Before starting the movie, I went into Language to use the 5.1 PCM uncompress option for audio for better quality. First thing I noticed on the intro scene. The picture quality was grainy on the black and white. I was a little disappointed on that part. The first action scene where Bond was trying to catch a bomber alive. Seems like they used strings and pully like you would see on a Hong Kong martial arts scenes. Not as believeable as I would like. I don't see the new Bond as charming as the previous and witty. Looks more like the silent type.  The conversations between Bond and other characters is not what you normally see on a Bond character. I.E. Sean Connery, Roger Moore, and Pierce Brosnan. I don't know if they are trying something different with this new Bond, but they are infusing more action than witty conversations with the enemy. Every turn seems to have some kind of figthing action besides the interactions with the women. That's a different kind of action. I would give this movie a \\"TAKE A CHANCE\\".
B000B8QEYC|5.0|I have loved Enya's music from the first time I heard Watermark. On the first hearing on Amarantine, I admit I was a little underwhelmed. And then I took the CD to Italy for a trip and gave it quite a few headphone listenings and that's when it began to grow on me. And, a little foolishly, I have to now admit that it is my favorite, next to The Memory of Trees. I truly feel that, in my listening experience with Enya, her albums have a way of constantly revealing things to the listener. Small, little nuances that only repeated listenings will discover. The direction in Amarantine feels extrememly personal, almost like a glimpse into someone's photo album. An amazing album from a truly amazing and unique artist.
0307237699|5.0|I felt that the author presented a clear view of his political philosophy along with his basis for his beliefs from personal and historical examples.

It will leave you shocked and heartbroken.  <br /> <br />
B0000009SE|5.0|This is one of the \\"Big Band\\" records of the early 70's, very jazzy. The \\"Vaudville Era\\" had recently ended, tragically, with the unhappy \\"fan\\" from the Rainbow Theater's audience rushing the stage and physically attacking Frank Zappa, leaving him with lasting injuries, a year's inconvenience, and medical problems for the rest of his life. A year in jail wasn't enough for this guy, but it did bring in the next phase of FZ's catalogue. Of course, there were some people from before who kept it going, Don Preston, George Duke, and Aynsley Dunbar, all from the days of \\"The Mothers,\\" but this isn't a record by The Mothers. It is, of course, a crossover project, traditional big-band jazz, with a hard edge found in more popular music, but not really a rock recording.<br /><br />\\"Big Swifty\\" is an extended jam, made up of mostly free improv, but with the some of the most incredible, intricately crafted, tightly played  arrangements in the whole Zappa catalogue, even more so, considering the size of the band at this point. And here, one can see, Zappa, as a guitarist, was chiefly a jazz player. \\"Your Mouth\\" is somewhat silly and preachy, filler by some standards, but, as usual in this music, a little concentrated listening will show there was, of course, more work involved than what's on the surface. The same can be said of \\"It Just Might Be A One-Shot Deal,\\" a surreal, goofy, off-key sing-along style song with a beautiful pedal steel solo by \\"Sneaky Pete.\\"<br /><br />And of course, the title track, \\"Waka/Jawaka,\\" is purely big-band jazz for it's own sake. The assembled players work together as a unit, with plenty of room to do what they do well, and that's to play the music in front of them, as well as letting it fly when the time comes.<br /><br />\\"Waka/Jawaka\\" is a 180 degree turn from what was being performed and recorded for the previous two years, and some would call this a welcome change. But it really is a shame how it all came about, in a path of petulance from band members, production hassles, morons who think they know how to handle pyrotechnics, and loose cannons with violent tempers.<br /><br />But a pretty good effort, nonetheless.ssles, morons who think they know how to handle pyrotechnics, and loose cannons with violent tempers.

B00004VW0V|5.0|There are very few singer-songwriters who have a unique sound and a substantial body of work. After years of TV commercials for Cat Stevens, this young reviewer (23 years old) got pretty sick of hearing the sound of Cat Stevens' songs in 15-second segments. With the soundtrack to Harold and Maude, I began to love Cat Steven's unique phrasing and personal writing style. I heard the major albums, which are great, but I found a real gem with Foreigner. The first side is an interesting experiment that sounds grandiose today (though the recordings/engineering on this album are wonderful in general). His thoughts are allowed to flow in this longer piece, which allows Cat's songwriting to \\"breathe\\" and ramble outside the constraints of radio-ready singles. The second side is great as well. There are shorter songs, but they are murky and enigmatic, showing a dark side of Cat. My favorite track is \\"How Many Times,\\" a really gut-wrenchingly soulful piece about the monotony of a life without meaning.
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|While the book was groundbreaking and continues to be one of the most successful sellers in American literature, the film version also was significant in its own right. Its technological innovations continue to be discussed in film classes, however the photography, building sets, philosophical dialog, and minimalist romanticism make this a pleasantly fascinating watch for any viewer who has ground down their teeth while enduring the schlock pouring out of Hollywood over the past several years.

B000I2JKEC|4.0|I had only ever seen the TV version of the original Superman movie until I bought the HD DVD. So, as you can imagine, on TV it was in hideous pan and scan and with several scenes missing. In reality, I have never seen the 'full' movie until now. And I have to admit, it's far, far superior to Bryan Singer's self-indulgent mess of Superman Returns.<br /><br />It actually takes quite a while to get going, but there's so much going on that the running time certainly doesn't seem two and a half hours. Richard Donner shot it back to back with Superman II, so there's an extended opening act that establishes the plot of the sequel at the same time.<br /><br />Anyone who doesn't know the story of Superman must be from another galaxy, but for those people I will give you a quick soundbite. Kal El is the orphan of the planet Krypton, which has recently blown up. He comes to Earth as a baby and lands in Smallville where he is quickly adopted by a farmer and his wife and renamed Clark Kent. His dense molecular structure and his ability to defy Earth's gravity give him advantages over humans and ultimately he becomes...SUPERMAN! But who doesn't already know that?<br /><br />Clark Kent assumes an exaggerated, clumsy, meek newspaper reporter persona to distance himself from the Superman guise. Somehow everybody, including secret love Lois Lane, falls for it even though the glasses and the hair are all that is different. Hypervillain Lex Luthor (Gene Hackman) doesn't take well to the man of steel as he might interfere with his plans for Real Estate Domination (the modern term for World Domination). But does he really think he can win? Hypervillains never know when to be humble.<br /><br />Just about everything that was terrible about Superman Returns is completely right about this one. The cinematography, the music, the editing, the pacing. I won't call the SFX fake, since it doesn't ever take you out of the film, so I'll just call them 'quaint'. For 1978 they're good and even though they are all done optically it's still better than the CGI crapfest of Singer's interpretation.<br /><br />Christopher Reeve's ultimate fate does kind of upset me, so it's good to see him in his prime and being made immortal in a way. The cast of this film does have a lot of big names. Along with the huge scope and spectacle, such a large cast adds to the epic feel of it. Marlon Brando, Gene Hackman, Ned Beatty, Margot Kidder, Terence Stamp and Glenn Ford just seem like a far more dynamic bunch of actors than Kate Bosworth and Kal Penn. Don't you think?<br /><br />It's been 29 years since this film was released and people still make a big fuss over it today. In 29 years, will be still be talking about Superman Returns? Outside of ridicule, I think not.<br /><br />The HD DVD features a nice 2.4:1 1080p transfer with Dolby Digital Plus sound and loads of extras.en though they are all done optically it's still better than the CGI crapfest of Singer's interpretation. <br /> <br />Christopher Reeve's ultimate fate does kind of upset me, so it's good to see him in his prime and being made immortal in a way.

B00068TJM6|5.0|Earlier this year, I purchased the gold-finished edition (Seiko SNA414)and was so impressed that I ordered the stainless steel, Seiko SNA 411.  Both watches are amoung the best looking and working time-pieces available at any price.  The readability of the markings on the slide rule are better on the stainless version.  White letters on black background are easier to decipher than gold on black.  I must admit that all the markings are too fine for my 56-year-old eyes to use on a regular basis, even with my reading glasses on.  However, the Seiko satisfies my hunger for the charisma of a Breitling and keeps better time, too.
B00005JPLU|5.0|300 is perhaps one of the most enjoyable movies that I've seen.  300 is a screen adaptation of a graphic comic and, in that context, it delivers exactly what you would expect.  I came out of the theater thinking how refreshing it was to see a movie that was everything it set out to be and nothing more.  If you are expecting something deep then this is NOT the movie for you.  300 is based on a historical event but only loosely so.  The plot and the charachters are shallow but excellent in their simplicity, as is the everything else about 300.  Everything is invested in telling one story and leaving it at that. <br /> <br />There is a small taste of accuracey to be had in 300 but primarily it is more of a visceral ride than a historical account.  It tells of the Spartan King (Leonidas) who is faced with a tough decision:  bow to the Persian God/King Xerxes and give up everything that Spartan life is composed of or face the Persian army and die in Spartan's defense.  Already knowing what the Persians have in mind for him and his people Leonidas is motivated to march 300 of his best to certain death rather than face slavery at the hands of the Persians. <br /> <br />I've read in countless reviews that people have a hard time grasping Leonidas decisions and attitudes but if anyone has studied warrior societies then the decision of Leonidas is to be expected.  They don't relish the thought of death but knowing that death is inevitable they choose to make their deaths mean something.  Leonidas sums it up later when he says that history will remember that 300 Spartans gave their lives in defense of their world. <br /> <br />So, with his decision made Leonidas takes 300 of his best men and meets the Persian army at the \\"Hot Gates\\".  A narrow passageway from the coast that allows the Spartans to use the terrain to funnel the Persians until only a portion of their army can engage them at a given time.  Here the Spartans put up a valient (but ultimately doomed) defense, holdingthe Persian army on the coast while giving the rest of the Greeks time to come to terms with how they intend to deal with the Persians that will soon be spilling into their country.  300 doesn't waste any steam ellaborating what the rest of the Greeks or up to, although it does go into a little political intrigue concerning the fight Leonidas queen must face to try and commit the rest of the Spartan Army.  In the end, this hardly matters and is not fully developed but it does setup the ending of the movie where the full might of the two armies (that of all the Greeks and the Persians) meet on battlefield of Platea (spelling?).  But ultimately 300 keeps the focus on Leonidas's force of 300 and thier role. <br /> <br />Visually, 300 is a beautiful peice of work.  Much like the comic the visuals are simplistic and muted with occasional vibrance for effect (primarily this is in the form of the Spartan's crimson uniform and the blood they are spilling).  A mixture of film is employed throughout the fight sequences including a fair amount of slow motion and camera closeups.  After watching action movies where the action scene assails the viewer with chaos I enjoyed again the simplistic nature of 300's fight scenes.  You are up close with the combatant immersed in the smooth choreography and pristine CGI. <br /> <br />The sounds and musical score are also appropriate for the theme of the movie (no, I didn't find anything wrong with the guitar riff at the climax of action, it felt appropriate for the movie I was watching).  The sounds of blows, screams and other such effects are concentrated while the rest of the combat noise is pushed into the background.  Not realistic, but very appropriate for the film. <br /> <br />The acting, as said above, is nothing if not simplistic.  The script is basic, to the point, and consists primarily of stirring statements that are used to up the pulse of the movie.  The actors are in no way pushed to bring anything across as the movie, asa whole, builds everything and as much as the audience is the actors appear to be swept up in it. <br /> <br />In the end I can that 300 is a movie that I will certainly add to my collection and one that I will find myself watching a lot in the future when I want some simple entertainment and an action movie that focuses on one thing:  ACTION.  Imagine that.

B000BP5RVG|5.0|I just read Treasure Island, chapter by chapter, to my six year old son as a bedtime story. As soon as we finished, he wanted to re read it; and we will.  In the morning and during the day, he spontaneously talked about the characters and the action and asked questions that he had clearly been giving a lot of thought to. We stopped during every page, sometimes on each paragraph, to talk about words and concepts that were new for him. It was a powerful experience for him in just how great reading can be. It was a great read for me, too. Stevenson is writer with a gift for economy of description who at the same time creates clear pictures and moves his story with striking action scenes. This book is far more gripping than most being produced today to entertain or train children, maybe because it's not a \\"children's story\\"; the author never condescends. I don't see why anyone would bother with any of the abridged or retold versions, if you do, you are cheating yourself and your child. The origianl is not hard to read or understand and it's fun and exciting. For most readers today I think this book will also reconnect to or open up a world that goes far beyond the action of a great story. I recommend this version because I love the Wyeth illustrations; his dedication to creating them just shows the way this book reaches into the hearts of the young and old. We're buying \\"Kidnapped\\" next.  <br />Warning, for some children it might be disturbing that Jim's father dies. Also, Jim's mother's portrait is limited and unflattering (though Long John's wife is portrayed as loyal and independent and competent). However, these are not flaws in the novel, but depictions of the world that Jim lived in and part of the underlying, understated, power of the book, which is of a piece with its times. If it were not, why read it?  <br />And they never say \\"Aaarrhh...\\"
B000IFQLSW|5.0|and if you really want to be wowed-- go see the concert--- just saw the first show in Shreveport, LA  It is AWESOME-- Kenny has outdone himself on this one--- this cd/dvd set (you MUST OWN this set!!!!!)  and tour could be a historical event-- seeing 93 year old Pinetop Perkins and 75 year old  Hubert Sumlin on stage playing better than most 23 year olds was spine tingling!!  the concert in Shreveport was 3 hours -- yes, 3 hours of blues with some of Kenny's classics including VooDoo Child thrown in for good measure
0743289412|1.0|I'm a big King fan.  That said, Lisey's story was disappointing.  He tried to do something new but between all the flashbacks and made up words, a reader could lose interest.  My wife put it down and never picked it up again.  <br /> <br />It seemed that he was paid by the word.  He would use a cliche, and follow it up with other cliches meaning the same thing, like he was trying to come up with something new, a different way to skin a cat, trying to build a better mousetrap, a new spin on an old story.  If that last sentence put you off then Lisey's story isn't for you.
B000AP04NI|4.0|One of Rodgers and Hammerstein's best. I think 4.5 would be more accurate.  But not quite up to \\"The Sound of Music\\", or \\"The King and I\\"
B000NVIXFK|5.0|So far, I have only heard \\"Far Cry,\\" the new single.  If that song is representative of the whole album, Snakes and Arrows should be superb. The sound is similar to Vapor Trails, but a bit more melodic.  May 1st, 2007 should be a good day. <br /> <br />
B00000F14B|5.0|I have watched at least 7 times.  Great film to watch with your children
1582701709|5.0|The thoughts expressed in this book give incredible insight into how much control we have over our own circumstances.  Read it and write!!
B00003CXE7|5.0|Good role for Crowe, well directed and appears to be fairly accurate of Roman Empire life
B000MTPANQ|5.0|I knew that this would be good after the excellent reproduction of the Crazy horse show at the Fillmore. I wasn't disappointed at all-the sound quality is excellent and the selection was a Journey through the Past of Neil in his most intimate setting back in Canada. Songs found only previously on \\"Time Fades Away\\" are presented here with real emotion and clarity along with stellar renditions of \\"A man needs a Maid/Heart of Gold\\" and \\"Old Man\\" (especially liked the Video images on the DVD of the ranch) \\"Helpless\\" is presented to the folks of Ontario with real heartfelt emotion. \\"Dance,Dance,Dance\\" from the original Crazy Horse LP is presented at the end of the show with the Audience lending a hand. \\"Bad Fog of Loneliness\\" is a selection that I had never heard before so was a rare treat. Neil closes and opens his show with two chestnuts from his days with the Buffalo Springfield which is fitting since this entire show reminds us, as Dan Fogelberg would later pen, of the Age of the innocent.The inner sleave tells of a huge project that Neil is releasing later this year coveringthe 1963-1972 period-I can't wait. Bravo on releasing these Gems to your fans Neil.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|Still a pleasure to watch.  Enjoyable comedy.  Bill Murray, Dan Ackroyd and Harold Ramis at their best.  Great support by Rick Moranis and Sigourney Weaver. Very good direction and script.
0618680004|5.0|I had yet to get to Dawkins until this book.  I thought the book was exceptional in logic and science.  I do want to post some pages I found to be good on some points.  Pages 250, 282 and 317 are worthy of some reading and had some solid points I want my review to page prominent.
B00003CXBK|5.0|This is quite arguably the best anime film ever created! At the very least, it's the best I've seen!  A must have for any collector of Anime films.
B000MNP2KI|4.0|I've always been a marginal admirer of the James Bond series. Sean Connery was obviously the man to beat for the role of 007, but boy, the other actors, in my opinion, really fell far short of his mark. Roger Moore? The guy had so many stunt doubles you have to wonder how he justified his paycheck. Pierce Brosnan? OK, but as an actor, he doesn't have much range. (And, like Moore, he provided plenty of work for stunt doubles.) <br /> <br />\\"Casino Royale\\" completely blew me away. Not only was it a great, fresh, vital, exciting Bond picture, I thought it was one of the best of 2006. It's just a cool movie! And Daniel Craig? HERE is James Bond unleashed. Craig does excellent work. Not only did he do many of his own stunts, in some of the most thrilling and well-filmed action sequences in many a year, he also made Bond an intriguing, scary, likable character. Who knew there could be so many facets to 007? Judging from Roger Moore's work, it was definitely hard to tell. <br /> <br />Craig carries this sleek, often brutal, exceptionally well-produced movie on his capable shoulders. He's got great charisma (think Harrison Ford crossed with Steve McQueen), a wit as dry as one of Sean Connery's martinis, and looks just as comfortable with blood on his face as in a tuxedo. Even if the film itself had been average, or even sub-par, Craig's swaggering, low-key presence makes it something special. <br /> <br />Thankfully, the movie is anything but sub-par. Martin Campbell handles action scenes and poker table intrigue with equal brilliance. The writing impressed me the most. \\"Casino Royale\\" seems long because it takes time to develop the characters and story, a rarity these days. The dialogue is razor sharp, and the actors clearly relish their lines. This may be the first Bond movie that DIDN'T put me to sleep in between chase scenes. <br /> <br />Can't wait to see the next Bond pic, as long as the producers are smart and keep Daniel Craig on board.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|One of the best anime films I have seen. Excellent story, creativity abounds, and animation is wonderful. Once you watch it, you will want to own a copy!
0446677450|4.0|It was an interesting book. I got tired and I skipped pages in points that the same were repeated over and over. The speech in some points was too childish, but the main points were interested and they reflect the reality. The personal examples were excellent, you learn better by them and you can compare them with personal experience.
