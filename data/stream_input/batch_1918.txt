B0097NGUJG|5.0|It's kind of a light-rock, indie album. What makes it weird is the mix of a cappella vocal harmonies and electronic beats and sounds. Definitely worth a listen.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I was completely gripped from the moment I started reading and have not been able to put the book down.
B0058VW36U|4.0|This was purchased for my grandson to play when he visited. He liked it  and enjoyed it.  Did Not like the popup ad to purchase a higher priced addition.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|very fun, creative, and innovative!  Also challenging, but not maddeningly so.  I got it as a free app of the day but wouldn't hesitate to pay for it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|love this show! can't wait for the rest of the season to return! it takes a while to figure out all the characters, but once i did...it's great~!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Omg! Such an unexpected ending.. Cannot wait to read the next one!! And hopefully Gale will get some face time.
0545425115|5.0|Great book. The movie was an excellent adaptation. Books are always better than the movie. I watched the movie first, and it made the book so emotional, cuz it was so easy to picture what I was reading.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|O love this game but.....<br />I wish there were more than 4 characters.<br />Some ideas for characters are:<br />1)a girl with rainbow hair<br />2) a girl with long blonde hair<br />3) a guy with a hair cut like Justin bieber's<br />4) a black dog<br />5) a white cat with gray spots<br />6) a guy with an afro<br />7)a girl with short, curly read hair<br />8) a boy with blue and green hair<br />9) a lion<br />10) a giraffe<br />Please consider these ideas!!!! That would make it the BEST APP EVER!!!!! Other than that, this app is AWESOME!!!!!<br />Great to pass time when your board
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|paid for the full game but will not load now. tried to uninstall and reinstall but will not reinstall. waste of money.
B0087DIEGE|3.0|Does what it says, nice clean fit and good operation.  However, as has been noted by several other reviewers, the joints are not that tight and you have to exercise extra caution if out on the beach or someplace where there's a lot of sand or dust.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|What would you do if you woke up one day and a deadly pandemic had taken over?  How would you defend yourself and your family?  How would you survive with limited resources?  The Walking Dead is an eye-opening thriller that makes you realize that the government's priority is to protect itself and not the individuals.  Only you can truly protect yourself.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is cool but please can anybody join my world I only have pe on my Kindle Fire Hd
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I didn't think TuneIn could possibly get any better...but it has..if you're a music lover..this is the last app you'll every need!! Love it..use it... Recommend it !!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Amazing book. Very descriptive by very worth it. Nothing like I've ever read. Keeps you wanting more. Keeps  you waiting.
B004GYY714|5.0|I have to give this app two thumbs up!! I love listening to music.. And this is my GO-TO musics app...in fact it's the only one I ever use... Highly recommend this app if you're a music lover!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can't even put into words how AMAZING this book was!!! I couldn't put it down from the second I picked it up. It made me cry, made me laugh, made me smile, and so much more emotions! Such an amazing book!!!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I honestly did not expect much given all the reviews that the product was sub-par with mismatched discs that only sometimes worked. I can tell you all of these reviews must really be outdated because my product was much better than described.<br /><br />The case was a decently sturdy plastic case which inserts into a cardboard sleeve. All 8 discs worked beautifully. They were all the widescreen versions and all had the proper artwork on the discs (no blank covers or 'disc1' flubs).<br /><br />5 stars given based on price. Are there bonus material discs? No. Are there other quality of life improvements that could be had? Yes. But this set gives you all movies for alittle over $3 a movie at the time of this writing and at that price range I cannot ask for more.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Bosch doggedly pursues a cold case his superiors don't want solved and it leads to an unexpected resolution.  The process of tracing the murder weapon through a complex series of dead ends adds to the mystery and suspense.  Keep it up Michael Connelly.
B004EPZ070|5.0|Well worth the price! The dvd case is a bit flimsy, but not too bad, and the dvd is quality! :D Good for the common chick flick lover! :D
0061801313|5.0|i got these for my girlfriend, who loves the tv series and has not read the books.<br /><br />i have not read them so i cant say much about these other than they appeared to be good quality<br /><br />she never read them so i cant even ask her how they were :(
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|I liked and have never read before but the way he was treated was a little hard to read as I love animals. Still great book. Would tell friends to read it.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|Anna Kendrick was excellent and so were the supporting actors.  Good for all ages...my 13 yr old daughter enjoyed it
B009WO7NQO|5.0|A really fun game that I never get tired of playing, the game really absorbed the essence every Star Wars game should have. A must have for all tablets, Ipods, and smart phones.
B008VO3PA4|4.0|Sweet and funny and just delightful.  Could have better photos, though.  I think it needs a sequel.  That is all...
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|It proved greater than expected when I bought the game, especially since waiting rooms turn into your cool new playground.
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|the fun ends too quickly unless u want to pay real money!  find a different game...don't waste your time on this.
B00APUQH0W|2.0|Storyline is weak and trite, with too many competing themes not well integrated.  Acting and direction were not high priorities for this film.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|It is just what I was looking for to carry my Kindle. It's small and easy to carry and securely holds the Kindle in place. The bright red color lets me see at a glance where it is located in the room, The outside is non-skid so when it is used as a standing case it doesn't slide.
B0086700CM|5.0|I enjoy this game and the app, technically, is amazing. Having a little trouble controlling his running speed. Other than that, terrific game!
B001NEK2GE|5.0|My family and I  love Amazon. We all have wish lists for Christmas , birthdays etc. Therefore we are assured that whatever we buy from these lists will be loved. And it always is. Makes live so much easier and ensures that the recipent also loves it.
B0072NWJRK|4.0|Very interesting, true who-dun-it.  Beijing in the late 30s complete with mythology, customs and the foreign settlements.  Highly enjoyable read.
B00846REIS|5.0|This was an excellent read. Each page left me wanting to read more. This book wad not what I typically read, but I would recommend it to others.
1444757202|5.0|Kept me in a quandry and on the edge. Read it on the plane enroute to visit family. So good, the plane ride felt more like a couple of hours instead of a five-hour flightI ended up wanting everyone of my avid-reading friends to enjoy it as much as I did; thus, it made for fantastic holiday gifts. Every one of my friends reported similar sentiments regarding 'The Racketeer'. Very entertaining. Has big movie screen potential. Needless to say, I loved the book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is easy but and challenging at the same time.P.S I'm am just 9 so if I speller something rong I'm sorry.
B005HSL626|5.0|Highly addictive and everlasting fun.  Easy to get started and very interactive.  Great example of what of a mobile game app should be.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I haven't been this moved by a book in years.<br />I was sceptical, at first hearing of the movie a year ago. I didn't know what it was about, but I just assumed it wasn't worth my time to read the book. But I'm so glad I did because it is awesome, and well written. Can't wait to read the next book, and see the movie!<br />I gave it 5 stars because to me it had no flaws.
B003G4W49C|3.0|This was okay, I think it is targeted for the younger reader than the real mature sci-fi fan. I'm not sure I'll follow up with the other books in this series.
B0076DELIG|4.0|It's like putting on an old pair of comfortable loafers.  Easy bedtime reading.  I'm looking forward to some more Lincoln Lawyer stuff.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Such an amazing book. I am absolutely speechless. I just finished reading this book and I couldn't put it down the entire time I was reading it. It as captivating and I loved everything about it. Colleen Hoover is an amazing author and I loved her two other books, Slammed and Point of Retreat. Those books were amazing too! I am looking forward to more books by Colleen Hoover and I know that they will be just as amazing or even better than Hopeless was!!
B007HACDLK|5.0|The Mitch Rapp series has been a great companion over the last few years.  I only wish someone like him and CIA director Kennedy actually existed instead of this group of traitors who are hell bent on destroying everything good about the USA.  Vince  Flynn writes with a clarity that few have.  I hope and pray for his full recovery.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Great book! I love the story behind each person. Can't wait for the next book to come out in 2013! Excited to see Travis's point of view!
B00A757EFW|4.0|This game kept my interest fora long time. It was great!  Loved the challenge. Nice to see old games new again.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|great great product.  Very easy to install (even though the instructions leave a lot to be desired)<br /><br />Did have to remove Mobo to install back plate but that's expected for something this heavy (it's a beast)<br /><br />Incredible change in my temps and everything seems to be running along quite nicely.<br /><br />Could be 5 stars if the instructions were updated to be more like Quick Start guides for other products
B007QUUJMG|4.0|This is a thought provoking book although i enjoyed the movie more. The screenplay was by the same writer. He did a fantastic job on the movie supported by an excellent cast. I read the book because I enjoyed the movie so much but it didn't really provide any greater depth of characterisation and lacked much of the warmth and humour of the movie. It was also much less dramatic than the movie. If I had read the book first, I may have enjoyed the book even more.
B000V39KDO|5.0|If you like Gerard Butler and action, this is the one for you! Plus its based somewhat on a true story!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|I love this geam and I think evrebuty shood dawnlod this geam if your looking for fun and a chaling you have faond it I spent 4hawrs on this geam. And I think hoo ever is reading this shood download. it emdele :)
B0090X4GLW|5.0|Excellent movie for pre-teens and teens.  They love the music!  We bought the movie as well and the kids practice the dance moves.
1471101223|2.0|Read too much like a swim manual and the personal details were very superficial.  The review and interview from the Guardian led me to believe it was more of a personal story and less a swim diary.
0240810554|4.0|If you are serious about your dkroom work, you need this book. You will not regret the purchase. He has published a companion book that I would recommend as well.
0307155102|5.0|i bought this for my grandbaby because when her father was a little boy it was his most favorite book....he is 29 now and still has the book.....i highly recommend ALL of richard scarrys books
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I enjoyed this book. Suspenseful and complete.  It was just the type of ending I was hoping for without being to predictable.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I think it would take a moment to get to know about it and the rest of this is a great game and I heard a lot more information about it but the information is to long
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was awesome and I found myself not being able to put the book down.  I recommend reading this book!!
B008N1V11U|5.0|GAMELOFT IS AWESOME  (I now it is so short but in I am looking forward to get the information about it)bunny hunT gR8 but Jr JR Shi adj adj ssh ssh eh eh dBm dBm chef ft Dr Klein bidding field seen ft by by Nino no by by vs vs xxx Dr
B006CQLGXG|5.0|I have always enjoyed this book and in this format on my phone, it helps me when<br />I am waiting for car repairs and such.
B0053O89WY|5.0|Perfect  I don´t want to write anymore.... Next time i will not leave feedback...ok ok ok ok o k  o k
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|This book definitely kept me on the edge of my seat.  It went back and forth from present to past time and made me want to keep reading to find out what happened.  It was pretty sad, but a good read!
B005VPRG10|5.0|My son loved it! I can't wait to see the pics of this put together!! He was very happy! Thank you
B004I2K4DY|5.0|This  is  a  concert  performance  that  i  as a  song  writer  find  very  inspiring and  very  educational.  cant  wait to see the  movie
B003ZSJ212|5.0|I love this!! I'm so glad to have order this....picture perfect super clear!!! Thank you! its makes it that much more enjoyable!
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|Great building and game playing - 8 year old twins love it. blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah
B007PPE086|5.0|I'm the best mom ever! My little girl loved it!! Its the in thing you know....so I've been told!! She had a great Christmas
B007SGM084|5.0|Very entertaining!  hard to put your device down once this is downloaded. it provided many sleepless nights was the only downside.
B003SHYVO8|3.0|you don't watch these movies for gripping plots or good acting. TERRIFIC dancing though. Worth it if you love dancing
B002KVCA1O|5.0|listening  to the great music from one of rocks greatest bands brought back memories of my youth. Plus a great price made it a great deal
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good storyline, great puzzles! I just played it for two hours and lost track of time. Looking forward to more games from G5.
B008K6HN8I|4.0|Works great. Just not real obvious where downloads end up. The download folder makes it look like they're not installed yet. Go to app manager file to see them.
B008MEM24S|4.0|I'm 14 and I bought this app expecting a somewhat okay game but then it actually worked out perfectly for me! If your like CUT THE ROPE<br />Or those Types of games this is for you! I also suggest the app PUDDING MONSTERS if you find this enjoyable.  Nothing could go wrong with DISNEY games!
B009NPM5Y2|3.0|Move has a wonderful sound track of old classic Rock. Acting was very good plot was ok. You must like Musicals and classic rock to enjoy this Movie. Tom Cruise did very well portraying his part but really went over board on the Zoned out persona.<br />They also coud have left out a gay montage which would have made the movie better.<br />Excellent singing.
1451695195|4.0|This book tells a very beautiful story, and no doubt the author feels he experienced everything in this book. He also has the medical background to describe the whole thing, and this read well and true. But the question remains...Was he just hallucinating?  IMHO, this is exactly what he was doing! No harm done; a perfectly legit reaction from the hospital bed, and one that will be undergone forever, just as it has in the past!  I would also suggest O. Sachs' current HALLUCINATIONS, a nice anecdote to \\"PROOF\\"...It is probably hard to be scientific, even rational, when undergoing the experiences described by Dr. Alexander. The scientific alalysis is provided by Dr. Sach\\"s for similar mind-bending trips..A *4* for the heart-felt narrative, and great writing. But I cannoit give a *5* rating for the reasons noted.
0316236535|5.0|my 6 month old son loves it! He likes the bright colors and pictures. It does a great job with adding and subtracting details
B00063F8B2|5.0|If you like the music from the film, then you will like this.  My grandsons love the movie and it is played a lot at Christmas. Now they listen to this and we even dance to the&#34; Hot, Hot Chocolate&#34; song.
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|arrived in plenty of time for Christmas.  Was loved by the receiver of this gift.  Great childhood memories watching this.  Thanks
B008MEM24S|5.0|My 5 yr old grandson loves Perry so this was a must have game. Works flawlessly on my Kindle Fire
B001UV4XHY|5.0|Arrived in time for christmas.  My daughter has been a fan since she was little.  She is now grown and we have watched every movie and it seems strange to see the conclusion in sight after so long.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I had seen this movie in theaters and knew my sister would want to see this movie. This is a wonderful movie and makes me cry every time I watch it.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Wow!  If I could give this 6 stars I would.  One of the best books I've ever read.  I could hardly put it down.
B008WCP2PG|5.0|This was definitely a great girls night movie. I saw this movie in theaters twice and knew I'd have friends that would want to watch it. Channing Tatum is beautiful, made the movie really easy to watch ;)
B00772M1F6|5.0|JD is a fresh new voice in real rock and roll.High energy,catchy songs,authentically and passionately captured to tape.If you like Little Richard,Louis Jordan and early Bo Diddley,you'll love JD!
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|Yeah, yeah...I've read other's reviews.  Some like it, some hate it.  Some think it's great work, others can't see the connection with the first and second movies in this present trilogy of Batman movies.  Well...here's my opinion.  It's a fantastic and sometimes over the top action movie.  It has some stronger roots to the Batman comic strip more than it has to the previous two movies.  It also symbolically talks about so many different things that occur in our society.  So criticize away.  However, the movie was more fun for me to watch as an adult, than say &#34;The Avengers&#34; which brought more of the kid out of me.  Batman still leaves me in my adult mindset, admiring a &#34;Superhero&#34; and all the .  To each his/her own.
B008VBYN80|3.0|Fun for a short time, then you run out of energy. I refuse to pay for more. If you want to spend, feel &quot;free.&quot;
B00992CF6W|4.0|I think it is great and is a nice challenge that makes it a little hard. I am 12 years old  and a girl its not just for boys. Its fun and creative with challenges. I would recommend it for 12+ both gender. The only problem I have with the app is sometimes it spazzes out in the middle of my game. It doesn't erase  your game but it stays in a lock mode for 3+ minutes. Overall I would really suggest this app.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|Liked the product, was followed by grandson during the Christmas Advent season, which was what we had hoped to acheive!
B00A0SJWQU|4.0|Pretty good remake. Had nothing to do with Mars though. Sexy co stars had awesome fight scenes. Will probably watch it again.
B004J4WKTW|1.0|I found this book to be extremely confusing and frustrating, as did the majority of my fellow book club members.  No character depth, hard to follow plot (was there a plot?), timeline confusing, an ending? -the book just stopped.  Is it fantasy? Make believe? Magic?  A dream?  Imagination?  Someone suggested the point of the book might be the descriptions of the circus and not the plot or characters.  Unfortunately for my concrete sequential mind, this book was just pure frustration and confusion from beginning to end.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|made a perfect family gift that we all enjoy.  arrived early and made for some holiday entertainment and unwinding with the family.
B00A8Z6KN8|5.0|As Peter Jackson was able to bring Hobbiton to life visually, I feel Howard Shore has yet again captured the soul of J. R. R. Tolkien's beloved story.
0061537934|5.0|Same as the kid's version.. I love it, but it ran on a tad too much about racing. And, yes...I saw the title and I know, but....grin
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This was a great buy for me.  I lost the original charger that came with my Kindle Fire, so I wasn't able to use my fire in a few months.  Now with this cable, I use it everyday!
B00A0SKFLG|1.0|Hard to believe the Arnold version would be better. I never read the original story but I doubt it would change my opinion. I think had they simply redone the original movie but with the better effects it could be a winner.
B007GFDVEE|5.0|My son likes it and hasnt put it (or the other Mega Blocks) down since building it. I did have to help put it together, but it wasnt too hard once you actually look at and follow the picture directions. MY kids love all the Super hero movies and legos so this was a great gift!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great fun! Helps get your mind off of the troubles of the day. I would highly recomend it to others.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|This is arguably Tim Burton's and Michael Keaton's Best movie. I enjoy this movie every time it comes on and for $5 for the 20th anniversary you cant go wrong. I remember seeing Winnona Rider for the first time and made me want to see her first couple of movies (Edward Scissor Hands). I am not a fan any of the Baldwins nor Gina Davis and this movie is soooo good that I can look past their mediocre acting as this movie was written so well.
B008D30K7E|4.0|This is a very enjoyable book about a 100-year old Swedish guy whose life is a little like that of Forrest Gump, involving numerous accidental meetings with major historical figures. The writer combines humour with irony to great effect and there are quite a few laugh-out-loud moments.<br />The main character, Allan Karlsson, is an engaging and likeable individual who will keep you turning the pages. There are two narratives going on here; while we follow the immediate and momentous adventure of Allan's escape from the nursing home, we also learn about his life story. As with Forrest Gump, Allan has a significant if unintended impact on the course of world history as he rubs shoulders with an array of well-known names such as Stalin, Mao, Truman and more.<br />For some light and entertaining reading, this book is highly recommended.
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I watch it alot, it is a good movie and not  put you to sleep.<br />  me and dad enjoy alot. kris
B008J34466|5.0|This was a Christmas gift to my Granddaughter.  I hear she loved it.  I hope she will play it for me some day.
B007N5YIUS|5.0|I love Angry Birds Space.  It's so addictive.  It's one of the best games around for children and adults.  :-)
B007XHWROK|5.0|I think my Granddaughter loved her Christmas gift.  I hope she will play it for me some day soon.  She thinks he is hot.
B003K16P3M|4.0|What a journey. I am anxious to read the sequel. I really liked the idea of how these characters touched one another and their bond
B005LAII12|5.0|This was a Christmas gift to my Granddaughter.  I haven't seen it yet maybe they will show it to me one day.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|It's that guy that plays the Santa Claus that does...Oh, the young Natalie Woods is certainly a strong impact also...<br />I've seen a play, I've seen the copies...this is the one to get...THIS Santa Claus has a sense of magic about him...a Godly presence in his acting....I loved it this Christmas as much as I did when I was a kid....maybe more.
B009LDXQGC|5.0|This was a Christmas gift to my Granddaughter.  I hope she will play it for me some day.  I know she loved it.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have found this app very easy to use.  I can actually view Pinterest as I would on the computer, can pin new pins to my boards very easily and enjoy Pinterest when my kids have taken over my computer.  One of the best apps that I have put on my kindle for its ease of use and functionality!
B00AS1Q8FW|5.0|When I first saw the previews for this movie I was a little hesitant to go see it in theaters. All of my friends saw the hobbit already so we decided to see this.  I walked in expecting to see the next Mission Impossible movie but boy was I shockingly impressed.<br /><br />Before watching this movie, I hadn't read any of the books. I read some reviews on the movie before going and the only complaints I could find were mainly:<br /><br />1. John Reacher is much taller than Tom Cruise<br />2. The character in the movie is too confident, the character in the book is more subtly confident<br /><br />First let me start by saying that this movie was so good, it made me want to start reading the books.  There are 17 of them total. I started reading the first one, 'Killing Floor' as soon as I got home after watching the movie.<br /><br />The movie itself was action packed. It was more of your classic Action Mystery and almost had a feel of an action movie from the late 90's. There aren't any big twists or shocking turns and I liked that. It kept me interested without really trying to shock me after hiding extra facts we couldn't possibly know.<br /><br />The ending was one that you hope for in a movie. I won't ruin it for anyone but I was satisfied with how they ended the movie.<br /><br />I highly recommend watching this movie. By the previews, Tom Cruise's 'Oblivion' looked pretty good, but 'John Reacher' should not be overlooked. It was such a good movie it made me start reading the books and to preorder the Blu-ray which I almost never do.
B005HSL626|4.0|My kids will often grab my kindle and play this game for a long time.  One downside that we have found is that it will occasionally lock up on you and you have to exit the game and then restart it.  Otherwise this is a great way to keep the kids occupied for a few minutes at least-- and sometimes it can keep the grownups occupied for several minutes as well!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Grisham wrote a quikee. Not much reality here. Easy reading but ho hum. Most of his books have more complex and believable plots.
034580404X|5.0|my wife loved these books & is not wanting me to read them before the movie comes out.  books were great
B006LSZECO|3.0|A page turner, but I didn't think the ending was very good, it kind of fizzled away. Worth reading though
B009OWGMYI|4.0|Has a lot of HIM's most popular songs and a few I didn't really listen to until now... if you like HIM, the Rasmus, or the 69 Eyes I would go for it.
B008LA7RMK|5.0|Most tracks on this disc are pure Beach Boys! Classic southern California sounds. A must for all fans of the genre!
B005M61PGA|5.0|Most songs on the CD are really great with a few which are slow but OK and her voice makes up for it.
B003UESJH4|5.0|Had been recommended to us by family, and we certainly enjoyed this movie.  Enjoy movies about real people, know Hollywood stretches a bit:)
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I bought this movie because I loved the books and can't wait for the other books to come out. I recommend this movie for those who love action filled movie.
034580404X|3.0|expected more of the book no. 1, it is like very low chicklit, will see how the other two will be.
B0053TMP24|5.0|It's amazing not only is it exciting but it leaves you wanting more. While its fantasy it's great that it includes greek and Roman mythology I can't wait to read the mark of Athena.
B003F3FJQO|5.0|This series is such a well written, thrilling series. The best part about it is that my 12 and 14 yr. old boy and girl love them too.
B001C08RHA|5.0|i am a ve ry large marvel fan really good movie<br />0p8IHg<br />hbi9hg -ru\-193 u5\- hi by hi bye hi
B00633W614|5.0|Book two of Archer's trilogy.  A really fun, fast read.  I can't wait for book three to be available for Kindle!
B009HQ9UHC|2.0|This is another stupid game- not even close to the fun or quality of Angry Birds. Time waster- deleted this right away.
B0076DELIG|3.0|While Michael Connelly is definitely one of my favorite authors, and I purchase every new book he comes out with, this was not my favorite book.  I suspect that if I were law enforcement, or military, this would not be the case, but for me, the detail with which he described various departments of the LAPD and the use of acronyms was a bit much.  I wish this had not been the case, as I was living in Los Angeles during the 1992 riots, clearly remember the Viet Nam war, and am familiar with the areas he writes about, which ordinarily heightens my enjoyment of any book.  This is one reason I also keep buying Crais and Kellerman, although I now live in Kansas.
B0092MKFIY|4.0|I like this album a lot. I saw Imagine Dragons last summer at Bunbury in Cincy . They were great and this album is more than I expected.
B00AERRKHA|5.0|The book is typical Bujold with all sorts of mysterious twists and turns unexpected insights throughout. Only question I have of Ms Bujold is why did she stop writing?
B0084I9QI2|5.0|The remastered quality is well done, but for a this particular album, doesn't make much difference as it was done with perfection from the get go, 25 years ago! Listening to this record surprises me that these songs are that old, as they still sound Fresh! Amazing Album, and box set, DVD was a pleasure to watch as well, Full length concert of an amazing show in London, Awesome stuff! Will recommend to fans and Nonfans, as everyone needs to see what a unique  entertainer MJ was, especially here (In his Prime).
B003R50FRI|5.0|A phenomenal story of resilient humankind going from the depths of hell to angelic highs sometimes in the same moment. A story of understanding forgiveness as a means to move forward in ones life. Waiting for book two now
B00APUYWYA|3.0|The movie was all that I expected it to be however an hour in the download froze, for 30 minutes.  It was NOT my internet.
B00AMBK0X4|4.0|TED<br />I didn't know what too think.  For a couple of bucks, what a crazy funny movie. Three more words,.
B005LAII80|5.0|High calibre performances from the top down that aim straight and true.  Exquisite tech/costume design... ultraviolent dystopian glitz and glam. inevitable comparisons to robocop, the dark knight, and the raid... so if you dig those, you'll dig this too.
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|If your a fan of family guy you will LOVE this movie. From the opening scene to the end credits I was crying from laughing so hard.
B004OZZ624|4.0|Lots of suspense and twists and turns. The movie was full of great actors. Russell Crowe did a great job. The first hour set up a lot of the movie but the second half was great.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|Takes you back to the style of the early albums. A few great gems, lots of really good classic style rock n roll. Tyler's voice is amazing still
B007SGM084|5.0|Loved it! Great book, wish that there were more books so I could keep reading. Have already started to read them again.
B00722ZIBA|5.0|Nice as always every album the surprise us with some good stuff, my favourite song is &#34; Stars from here&#34;
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|5 stars are NOT ENOUGH FOR THIS SERIES....I love every morsel that is on the show, from Maggie Smith, to Anna and Mr Bates,the characters are wonderful..<br />I do think that Anna and Mr Bates need to match up in real life...<br />I've order Season 3 already --can't wait for January 6th to come..<br />Love the clothes, I'm into that fashion history, enjoy reading about clothes and how they were made back then.<br />Of course I know some day this show will end, but in the meantime, I can't wait to see what each series brings, and also, maybe more Emmy nominations will come to the show and cast...
B00969GFFU|5.0|This is true literature. Thus book is not just for fun. It makes you think about freedom in its various manifestations. Becomes more and more freedom, and eventually it turns to be its opporite: dependance... on stereotypes, social relationships, sex, drugs, the money and power.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Great alternative music! I loved the variety of artists. You do not have to like the movie or books to enjoy this.
B000066C6Z|1.0|The sound track was off and was very annoying. Very poor quality.  I would not purchase again.  If it wasn't a hassle I would return this.
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Very well laid out. Gameplay is fair and progressive. Brings out the kid and old memories in you from days past.
B002RVCD0U|1.0|This was the worst Terminator movie ever. Christian Bale can not act. He is the same in every movie I  have ever seen him in.
0553386697|4.0|I would recommend every parent to read this book. However, it can be used to understand everyone's brain and how to use the information about the brain to manage conflict and develop great negotiation skills with adults. The book repeats more than I like, but then I am a speed reader who likes to optomize my time when reading.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|The characters are very relatable. Seems more like a tale of dramatic irony. Where the audience knows more than the character. Very fun to read
B0018CWEYY|5.0|This season was great and I cant wait for more and for the price.  This is why I gave it 5 stars.
B004TE7BBO|1.0|This is a comic book....not the wonderful novel it was meant to be.  I would like to know if what was done to this classic work is even legal.  This is not only NOT what I was expecting (an illistrated book) but a travisty, of the original work.  I am sure that St Exupery would be appaled.  I do not recommend this book.
1589795474|5.0|This is just a great read if you really want to make sure that your life is in order.  I use this as a guideline ony because life is not perfect.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|Disney hit it out of the park this time - there is nothing better than a strong heroine, and Merida shows that the girl doesn't always need a prince to help her win the day.  Perfect movie for my girls - it is not as musical as most Disney shows are these days, which is not necessarily a plus for us, as we love the music, but the plot is very strong and teaches a valuable lesson to little girls (and boys!).....
1612680011|5.0|This is just a great read if you really want to make sure that your life is in order.  I use this as a guideline ony because life is not perfect.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Vivid, fascinating, tantalizing. Well written. Will suck you in, and transport you to another time. Way to go, Ken Follett.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was amazing. I read it in four days. I didn't want to stop reading. I definitely recommend this.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is simply the very best modern Christmas movie. Yes the classics must get their due respect, but Clark Griswold takes a back seat to no one. A must see movie!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I enjoyed every word of this book. I couldn't put it down and I was pleased with the writing style.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|Now THIS is a book for scifi geeks!<br /><br />If you've ever watched Star Trek, you know what happens to the guys in the red shirts--they're always the ones who die!  The main characters always wore blue or gold...and somehow they always made it. But those poor Ensign's in those red shirts....<br /><br />This is the story told from those Redshirts point of view. Andy Dahl and his friends are new members of the Intrepid, the flagship starcruiser of Universal Union--or Dub U, and those of us in the know like to call it. It doesn't take long for them to realize the death rate among red-shirt-wearing new guys is weirdly high.  As Redshirts themselves, they have a vested interest in getting to the bottom of things.  Their investigation leads to so great and unexpected geeky results, and a really fun story is the result.<br /><br />Unfortunately there is a ton of (im)mature language; it definitely pushed the limits of what I'll tolerate.  I can't recommend this book without that disclaimer. But if you are okay with being cursed at, you'll have fun with this book!
B006YTTVHO|4.0|I enjoy reading this book and hope everyone learn how to start talking with New people.<br /><br />I strongly recommend for you and all others.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|seriously, I swear it gets better and funnier the further it gets into the series. I was cracking up laughing while reading this. I'd give this ten thousand stars if I could.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is awesome..... my lil girl plays it all the time...she loves my little pony..I recommend this game ..
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app is simple and very easy to use.  No useless bells and whistles (in stark contrast to the junk produced by Microsoft.)  Well done!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It's great and all but, you have to go through each page I wish you could type the letter that the word is under
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Fun and challenging.  Nice to get as a free app!  Definitely recommend as a good thought provoking strategy game for all ages.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|A Very Very Very Very  Very Good Book.<br />Was Quite A Tale Of Friendship.<br />I Would Recommend It To You.
B004PAHZMC|4.0|I got this for my 5yo son to put his Lego's in but after breakfast on Boxing Day, I heard him tell his younger 2yo brother to 'get in so I can carry you around the house with Thor and Hulk' but had to stop that once mom came into the room. Later that day, both were break dancing (what they call break dancing) on it, mom stopped that, too. Lame. Now it just carries Legos, and a few funny stories.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Just stayed up all night to finish it.... this is a must read<br />I loved it from start to go finish
B008MG1E4A|4.0|easy to follow and quite interesting for a non-military person. Enjoyed reading the personal account of the writer in this story.<br />the fact that its a true story makes it more pallatable.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book was so much more than I had in mind, it really brought out my desires that I never knew I had.
B009DJB8I2|4.0|As far as an OST goes, this is a very nice set - comprising of 4 separate CD's, it takes a lot of space and has every song in Portal 2. That being said, it takes a lot of file space and organizing. This shouldn't be a problem for anyone though.<br /><br />Anyways, if you like Portal 2 - there's plenty in there for you to get what you're looking for.
B001F0WXY0|5.0|I decided  to read this book because my dad was a fan of the series.  I picked it up and was not disappointed.
1603427244|5.0|I've been knitting for 73...yes, that's right, 73 years and this is a wonderful book that should be in every knitters library.  I found some &#34;new-to-me&#34; ways to cast on & off.  Knitters always love to have something new to learn.
B002MGR18Y|4.0|Far better than I expected.  Good plot, good acting.  Had a &#34;Devil's Reject&#34;, Rob Zombie feel to the whole thing.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I found this book to be gripping.  I had a hard time putting it down with the various twists in the storyline.
B0055SWM08|5.0|Quell is one of those rare games that can be characterized as \\"elegant\\". The game play is simple and intuitive but solving the underlying logic problems can be quite challenging.  I recommend it highly to anyone that enjoys logic puzzles.
B0011TZTLE|5.0|I generally favor live recordings, and this is no exception.  Captures the energy and soul of Bob Marley better than his studio recordings.  I deleted the final track &#34;Kinky Reggae&#34; on which he intros the band members--too much time with only annoying background vocals--but ever other track is first rate.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game may look boring  but it is very addicting and all ages can do it. My 6 and 7 year old grandkids love it too. Lots of fun
B005HSL626|3.0|I can't really rate this game either because I never played it.  My friend's son wanted to look at something on my Kindle and evidently downloaded this game (or purchased it?)  without my permission.  I didn't see him playing this game because I was busy with other things.
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|For those of us who are older - this was a rather uncomfortable movie.  I wil not see it again.  One time is enough!
B0086700CM|3.0|I cannot really rate this game because I never played it.  My friend's son wanted to look at something on my Kindle and he evidently downloaded (or purchased?) it without my permission.  He showed it to me and wanted me to play it but I was busy with more important things.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|As always, NCIS is great; this episode was especially well done!  More of the mystery that is D'Nizzo is revealed.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I really don't know how to rate this product because my friend's son (15 yrs. old) wanted to look at my Kindle and he evidently downloaded (or purchased {?}) this game in order to play it on my Kindle.  I did not even know he was playing this game.  He did it without my permission.  It is the same with the next two games.  I only saw him play the &#34;Temple&#34; game but did not realize what he had done.
B00A0SJWQU|2.0|I love action/sci-fi movies and this was terrible. I fell asleep twice trying to watch it, could have been much better
B0091REZMW|3.0|I like this game. I don't like that they want you to join face book or Twitter and I don't like that you buy the full version and buy coins. When did free stop being free
B000W7JWUA|5.0|The best thing about this game is that you can set it up differently every time you and your friends / family play it. I also love how the game ends within a set period of time and will not go on forever like some other games (think of the one with the four railroads).<br /><br />Cons: The rules and their understanding took quite some time to get right. I had to read a few blogs and other guides to help me fully understand them. We still may not be playing the game exactly right.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|It was the best book I read it in less than twenty four hours.loved it you Mira Lyn Kelly ;)
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|Huge Tarantino fan. This movie is not only sort of aimless and amoral, but also lacks humor and has very little redeeming quality unless you like to smoke weed and watch Attractive people mostly naked, and some people who used to be attractive, who now are not, and endless violent scenes with little purpose. Now, I'm a fan of all of these things to some degree, I just like to have some type of cohesion. This would be a great movie to have on with the sound turned down, at a party, where everyone is getting wasted.
B004QKNXIQ|4.0|We loved Tangled!  It's another great Disney movie.  Had some issues streaming from Amazon - sound was very low and the movie kept stopping to buffer... rather annoying issues.  We often watch movies on the laptop and don't have such sound issues so I'm not sure what was going on here.
B000B5XOSO|4.0|This is for the 2-Disc Special Edition, which in addition to the film includes some great documentary segments, a music video, and so on. I have these Special Editions for each of the first four Batman films (Burton/Schumacher). If you are a Batman enthusiast, I would recommend them highly for the wealth of bonus features and behind-the-scenes insight that they offer. I have not jumped to Blu-Ray (yet), so I am not sure if there are better versions in that format or not.<br /><br />Anyway, as for the film in question, Batman Returns is still the darkest, craziest Batman film to date as of 2012. Whereas Christopher Nolan's terrific films are based in grittier realism and more well-developed characters and plotlines, Tim Burton's films are flights of surreal artistic fancy. I find both approaches appealing in their respective ways. Batman Returns is kind of like a long sequence of twisted choreography. The individual story and character elements are most of them pretty thin, but there are so many of them and they interact in such visually stimulating ways that it works. The cold, wintry Gotham City is very evocative, and I love the fact that this was before many if any of the special effects were done with CGI. This film is a great showcase for sets, costumes, makeup, animatronics and matte paintings.<br /><br />The main cast is terrific. I continue to be impressed with Michael Keaton as Batman, and you have to hand it to Tim Burton for picking him. Danny DeVito is loathsome, demented and creepy as the Penguin. Christopher Walken is great as Max Shrek. But the highlight of Batman Returns is Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. She is electrifying, sensual and the screen crackles with her charisma every time she appears. Meow. There are so many other little things that could be noted, and that feast details is part of the charm of this film.<br /><br />The primary problem with Batman Returns is that it is very dark and more to the point, frankly rather disgusting and occasionally borderline horrifying. Most of that comes back to the Penguin. There is virtually nothing to like about him in spite of his pity-inducing backstory. I believe that Roger Ebert said that, \\"the PG-13 rating is a joke.\\" It should have been rated R. It is not something for kids. Even adults seem to be divided on whether they really like it. For me, this film brings mixed feelings. As a wildly conceived and realized work of art, I find it stylistically impressive. As a longtime Batman fan, I can't help but enjoy a lot of it. But it is very, very dark and twisted, almost prohibitively so. In that sense, it is hard not to have some reservations mixed in with one's affections.nally borderline horrifying.

B009HEJXFS|4.0|The first M.I.B. has got to be one of my all time favorites. This was at least as good as the 2nd, if not better.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|A few funny parts for a 13 year old. I think it was a poor roll for Walberg and Mila Kunis who I really like. Seth Macfarlane isn't funny for most adults though, so if you have a hard time with Pot and fart jokes, I would pass.
B009O2XY12|2.0|You must be online to play this game. I like the games with options to play off line if needed.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Fun to watch funny and really good actors what more would you want in a movie.  Good for all ages  Fight scenes a bit long but my kids loved it
B003O86FMW|3.0|Overall I enjoyed this book, but felt that it was too obivously written as a second in a series of three.  To me, each book should stand on its own, not finish like the end of a chapter with the next book resuming where the previous chapter left off.  I sometimes wonder at Katniss' naiveness about everyone and everything.  You'd think as she has more experiences and matures more she would start to figure things out more.
B005LAII12|5.0|a good movie for adults.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed this book the best of the three novels in the series.  The whole idea of the future and the notion of the games is very creative.
B003UYV08E|5.0|Marvel.  need I say more?
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is an extremely well written book.  I think the use of &#34;Death&#34; as the narator is very clever and well done.  I have bought copies of this book to give to friends to read.  It is categorized as a &#34;teen&#34; book, but enjoyable to adults as well.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I really liked the movie  my kids(all adult) thought it had too much talking but I liked it because it brought alot of things to light
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|As I mentioned regarding the second book (Catching Fire) -- I sometimes wonder at Katniss' naiveness about everyone and everything.  You'd think as she has more experiences and matures more she would start to figure things out more.  Overall I enjoyed this book and the series.  To me the first book was the best of the three.
B001OQCV6A|5.0|Can't go wrong with Robert Downey Jr.  A very good movie for everyone.  No profanity No sex scenes. Not a prude but movies can be made without sex scenes
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I had never read an unabridged version and was not disappointed.  It is a classic and I enjoyed reading it around Christmas time (finished on Christmas Eve!).
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app is fun to pass the time and my dog just ate 25 dollars cause my wife was stupid and left it on the table
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This is such a good book.  It is both sad and happy at the same time.  Very well written and brings up history that many of us were not aware of.
B008MEM24S|1.0|if I could I would give it a 0 because I bought it and now I cant play it it says you don't Owen the app and ill half to pay agin. so I really wold not take that chance of buying it and u cant play it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read about a book every 2 to 3 days, I am a big book reader.  This book is the best book I have read this year.  It is so refreshing to read a book and have no idea how it was going to end.  It kept me reading and it was tough for me to put my kindle down and go to sleep at night. The story line is great (creative), I loved the characters, and it was very well written.<br /><br />At the end of the book, I looked up the author and realized she wrote two other books I have read, \\"Slammed\\" and the sequel... which I really enjoyed but this book was the best yet.  I will recommend this book to others and cannot wait for the next book. I never write reviews, I just had to with this one... Amazing... Just amazing.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I could not stop reading it!  And trust me it is hard for me to really get into a book. You should read it!
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|I enjoy this game very much. The various levels prevent getting bored. The look and sound are pleasant enough but are not obnoxious.
B0096YBEIS|4.0|This collection is not my favorite by the Fab four but it is still a very good collection of smooth grooves. If you've loved them in the past you'll love this collection as well. Recommended Listening!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Story of the kind of love that is unconditional. That is the only one that matters. Sparks is the best. LOVE THE BOOK-you'll, too. It's kind of BOOK that cannot be put down; you'll have to know what happened next. I'll recommend it to anyone that has doubts about life, not perfect life, but real, with ups and downs, with triumphs and failures. It gives hope that even when all looks bad, bleak-there is something ahead that we should strive to achieve. We just have to find that something and go for it. If we don't see goal in the future, we should focus on everyday goal and just go for it. Sometimes taking a day at the time is not a bad idea.
B008ZOHCKE|5.0|This app is great! I write plays, books, and songs. Also, I keep a diary. The password lets me keep any private info secret, and I love how you can make notebooks with as many number of pages you want. It's like having a bookshelf of never-ending notebooks. Five star all the way! Wish there were more covers, though.
B0091REZMW|4.0|the game is pretty entertaining when there's nothing else to do but the set up is not all that great but its pretty fun
B009JBZH54|5.0|there is not too much to say about what the title already says. If you are thinking to buy this trilogy you already know it so my comments are ment for the product. It came even earlier than the expected delivery date, the box is made of a really good materials it feels like some kind of leather, and also comes with some extra freatures like the the ultraviolet copy (for mobile devices) and also a discount if you want to buy some collectors edition thing.
B0007OCG56|5.0|This movie is a movie I can watch over and over. It is the only Adam Sandler movie I actually enjoy. All the actors were amazing and I love the cultural story behind it as well. I love that it doesn't have your predictable ending that all movies have. I don't want to go into to much detail as to not reveal anything. All I can say is that this is not only a must see, but a must buy. It is an endearing and funny film that anyone can get enjoyment out of.
B005EGXTHG|5.0|After I read the first Hunger Games book I couldn't stop raving to my friends and family about it.  I described it as 'the best book I've ever read'.  When I read the second I was blown away - much to my amazement it was even better!  I never knew what was coming next and it was the best surprise ever.
B004EPZ0BG|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie, I really did, but in two simple words, IT SUCKED!! I got it on the cyber monday sale this year thinking I would really like it and it was just terrible. You don't feel connected to the characters and the way they meet is just so cheesy to be honest.<br /><br />This movie could have been so much better, but it was just so dull. It had its funny moments (very few), but all in all I would say this movie was forgettable, yes, forgettable.
B005CRQ4GU|2.0|If you are looking for a great book this is it and it is for all ages. I <3 this book!!!!!!!!!!!!!
031603441X|5.0|I am a Stones era guy, and found this book absolutely incredible. I had a hard time putting it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Well this game ducks I'm just playing this game is cool really who ever says this game ducks you sick I'm just playing
B00785P2QC|4.0|This game is so great-! The only complaint on my end is that it is so addictive! I highly recommend playing if you don't have anything better to do
B007J4T2G8|1.0|So I took a gamble and bought the book since EVERYONE was reading it...I don't get the hype.  I'm not going to order the next two and the first one just didn't live up to the hype.
B009P5S11G|5.0|I would recommend this CD to the world!! I love Rihanna and everything about her. Glad it came in the mail fast :)
0761169253|5.0|For the most part, this little book is right on but there are several areas where direct parental input is called required.  The author places too much trust in making internet friends.  Caution is advised.
B001NLKZZ0|4.0|Certainly, playing golf and watching the pro's play you realize the mental complexity of the game.  The ideas presented in this book appear to provide important guidance to this aspect of the game which is so important and vastly under served by conventional golf instruction.
B00APUYWYA|2.0|It's a silly (sometimes amusing) film more for tweens and or teens than for more mature audiences.<br />Nothing else to say
B00A9X9ORI|3.0|This film is a decent action film, but most of the reviews I've seen have hailed it as a return to intelligent sci-fi and that is patiently not the case. Perhaps I'm a bit jaded, having been spoiled by some of the better Time Traveler movies of the past two decades with films like Primer, Time Crimes, and Twelve Monkeys. By comparison, Looper seems to feature a lazy attempt at world building with numerous plot holes. Performance wise, however, this film features some fine acting from all the leads, two of whom happen to play the same person. Emily Blunt is particularly believable in her role, which seemed to veer significantly from her usual fare. This a good popcorn movie, but I'd definitely rent it before you buy it outright.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I purchased this book as soon as it came out. I am a HUGE fan of Slammed and PoR and told all of my friends to read them. I saw that this book was coming out and was very excited to read it but worried it wouldn't live up to my expectations of her other two books. But HOLY CRAPSTICKS! It blew all of my expectations right out the window. I felt so close to the characters in this book. I cried, laughed, smiled, and fell in love right along with them. Deffinatly the best book I've ever read. I don't just \\"live\\" this book, I LOVE it. A-butterflying-mazing. Seriously. READ IT.
B00AMBLDEE|3.0|For the fourth film a series, this film has a ton of exposition, which is appropriate considering they are introducing a new lead character. For much of the film's running time, it plays out like a tense white-knuckle spy thriller. A cat and mouse chase game that we've seen before, but always seems to entertain when it is done well as it is in this film. At the last half hour things change gears and we are treated to an extended action sequence that goes on about 10 minutes longer than it should and then the film suddenly ends. There is no real resolution to anything that came before it, presumably so you'll rush out when the inevitable sequel arrives. I had a blast at least with the first bit, and I recommend for streaming purposes only. A bit of a warning, there is a particularly shocking scene involving someone shooting up their workplace that happens about 30 minutes into the film that, in wake of New Town, could be rather provocative.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I play this game about 12 times a day.  I't is the 6th game I got on my kindle fire.I't is the best game I ever got. Who would not want this game.I have another game that I like its called subway surfurs but I like this game better.I't is my favorite game on my kindle fire. If your getting this game your making a good choice.
B008JFUUIA|5.0|This movie never gets old. Saw it in the theater several times and after I got the DVD I watched it 3 days in a row. catch onto new jokes and stuff every time I watch it. LOVE it!
0307719774|5.0|I bought these books for my children, my husband and myself. I want them to have their own &#34;time capsule&#34;, so to speak.  It will be fun to see how their answers will change over the years... may we all change and grow!
B009B8YZKS|5.0|Live action movie starring Tom Green, as Thomas Lasky, and Anna Popplewell (the girl from the Narnia movies) as Chyler Silva.  The performances are solid, especially for Daniel Cudmore (Master Chief) the 6'6&#34; actor/stuntman who had to act behind all that armor . . . we never see his face.  Filmed in lush British Columbia, the production values are excellent with a lot of bang for their budget buck.  Sets props and costumes are very cool and the Halo universe is well represented.  Left open-ended for a sequel (which I hope will be produced soon) it tells the story of young cadets suddenly thrown into a war they never could have anticipated.
B00447L4JG|3.0|The movies itself is great, the quality of the DVD is not, it skips in some spots and was supposed to be brand new??
B000002KIE|3.0|2 stars for musical content / 1 extra for historical value<br /><br />This is a prime example of an \\"important\\" work of art that isn't very good, really. Other than God Save the Queen, Pretty Vacant, and Holidays in the Sun,  the songs are wandering, hook deficient,  mish-mashes of basic power chords overlaid with often unintelligible Cockney snarling. John Lydon usually sounds like he is a particularly bad scenery-chewing actor auditioning for the part of a minor Dickens villain. If this was supposed to sound dangerous or menacing in some way at the time, it doesn't anymore; 35 years later it just sounds silly.<br /><br />The best thing about this was it influenced people with more talent to make some pretty good music. Even some of Lydon's later PiL stuff holds up better.
B007R41E8O|5.0|You can only play just so far before you have to pay for the full version ($2.99). But it was well worth buying. Four of us played this game and enjoyed it very much.
B0049UHKVY|5.0|It would be ungrateful, if I did not make a personal review to this album and its rock metal band.<br /><br />I am a musician my self and I can honestly express; besides their great inspiration to compose, this band has very talented musicians in it.<br /><br />I really love this record, and also highly recommend most of the previous ones as well.<br /><br />I just found out about this band last year and they really brought joy to my life all 2012.<br /><br />Keep it going Seventh Wonder, looking forward to hear your upcoming records.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|An incredible game that is extremely addicting and so much fun words can not describe. I would suggest it to everyone and anyone that likes strategy games.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|Knew something would lend to the &#34;next&#34; book. A bit surprised by Pendergast&#34;s behavior overall, to me seems very &#34;out of character&#34;.
B0098460O4|3.0|I got the album.  It's nice.  But I was VERY disappointed in the Ave Maria. Even to the point of being angry.  The singing is wonderful, but they did not sing the entire Ave Maria. Be forewarned.... it is an abbreviated version. This is one classic that you do NOT cut short. There is no artistic license with this piece.  It is timeless.  It is precious. And it has religious significance to a great many people. I feel cheated. I bought this album specifically to hear Charlotte sing that song. If they did wish to do the entire song, then they shouldn't have done it at all.  Just as artists don't want their work pirated, so too, when they advertise a song as being there, it should be the entire song. Yes, I know others do it.  And it angers me each time.  These two are good enough to be able to dictate to those arrangers what they will sing. If space is an issue, then cut another one short.  Not this one.
B000NY12CI|5.0|I have read very few books in my life that have managed to completely change the way I look at the world, at religion, and at myself.  Infidel by Ayaan Hirsi Ali is one of these precious few book.  Her frankness and candor truly opened my eyes to what is stirring not only outside the Western world, but within it as well.  Ayaan is so inspiring and brave.  Her dedication to revealing the truth even were it to cost her her life has helped to strengthen my own convictions and beliefs in truth and goodness.  Ayaan has revealed a cruel world, in the process revealing all that so desperately needs attention and change.  Her fervent desire to emancipate women and children from the oppressive dogmas of Islamic malpractice and tradition is contagious and urgent.  Ayaan's voice rings out warm and clear.  We can no longer ignorantly and passively support the growth of such evils in our freedom-loving society.
B009NT0I06|5.0|Daughters record collection<br /><br />This is the 2nd Taylor Swift record I have bought for my daughter. The record sounds great!
B007C52NY2|5.0|I would not expect an author who calls a 27 year old woman a \\"girl\\" to be a widely knowledgeable feminist, but these are among the most woman-supportive books I have ever read, set in a milieu of political, medical, journalistic, social, cultural, criminal, economic, governmental, relationship, and sexual intrigue. They are gripping, insightful, informative, interesting, exciting, and believable, with several very strong female characters, not just the \\"girl.\\" There are some strong male characters, too, and the balance is gratifying.<br /><br />The only objections I have about these books are: (1) no pronunciation guide for the Swedish words, such as the names of cities, streets, and people, and (2) some of writing reminds me of children's reading primers from the middle 1900s, in the way the sentences are sometimes short and choppy, rather than flowing with conjunctions and better punctuation, such as commas and semi-colons... minor complaints in contrast to the extensive value of these books.
B005LAJ212|5.0|Awesome show! All ages easily get hooked on this series. Sure hope there's going to be a season 3. :)
B0093QFM6Y|5.0|I love this movie. I have the soundtrack for it and I am always looking to see when to see if it will ever be done in Texas. I might have to make the great trip to see this live. So pretty and the music is beautiful and who knew Gerard Butler could sing?
B009NQKPUW|2.0|I did not care for this movie it was not a great story but the run at being the beginning of the alien series way cool.
B0091WNK8M|5.0|I have loved this movie since it first came out. I finally got the kids to watch it and they enjoy it too.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|This was a great book!  It kept you going until the very end.  I can't wait to read more in the next book.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|As always another outstanding book! Thank you for all the hard work and long hours you put into a wonderful book for us to enjoy - I never want them to end!
0385344333|5.0|It's a Reacher book by Lee Child, need I say more?  Lee Child never fails to disappoint.  This book is on par with all of his others.  It is next to impossible to pick a favorite if you've read more than one or two of them.  Lee Child's books are quick reads, and there is never a good spot to set the book down.  Buy it!
B001J3U22S|2.0|I was missing this one out of the series and wanted to read it to fill the gaps.  A necessary read for the series but it drags.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Just bought this product last night and I'm returning it.  When holding up your hand to make a selection, it moves the icon hand so erratically across the screen that you have to resort to using the controller or voice commands. It has difficulty with facial recognition and we couldn't use it with Kinect Sports or any of our dancing games. We removed it and were instantly recognized by Kinect. Until they do some testing and refine the lenses, this product is great in theory but needs more time invested in execution.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I love this game but I can't  get past level 14. The patterns. It's so fun though. Buy this game. It's the greatest game  ever.
B00AHSMDQY|3.0|Honestly this movie was a let down. It's not a *bad* film simply by being a Christopher Nolan film, and a Batman film, but after the epic that was The Dark Knight, this movie pales in comparison.<br /><br />Without spoiling anything, let me just touch on a few issues.<br /><br />#1: Bane. This guy has no personality. Taken from the point of your average viewer, not a Batman-fan, I've never heard of this guy before. That's fine, as long as the character can grab me, but in this case, there really wasn't anything specific about him other than he was the 'big bad'.  Out of all the villains in all the Nolan-Batman films, he is definitely the worst, his only distinguishing feature being the dumb mask and the TERRIBLE voice-overs. Speaking of which...<br /><br />#2: Bane's voice! Seriously, what happened here? The voice is totally on top of the rest of the audio in the mix of this movie, to the point of it being comical. It sounds so on-top of the rest of the audio to the extent that it sounds like a narrative voiceover. It's really jarring and pulls you from the movie. I can't see how it WASN'T done this way on purpose given the polish of the rest of the film (and the other two nolan-batman films, for that matter), but I don't for the life of me know why...<br /><br />#3: Anne Hathaway's Catwoman: meh. Not bad, not great. Easy on the eyes. This is how I felt about the whole movie, really.<br /><br />#4: The plot. Really, the plot was insane, but in a bad way. Whereas the 1st movie made sense in a superhero movie sort of way, and the second movie was really just a tour-de-force and had a lot of twists that you could get away with because the joker was SUPPOSED to be a sociopath, the ultimate motivations of the villains in this movie didn't make as much sense.  I don't want to spoil anything so I'll leave it at that.<br /><br />Honestly I don't really feel like this movie needed to be made, other than that the 'Trilogy' seems to be the 'in' thing to do these days and WB wanted to cash in one more time. It's a shame, really, because it spoils the near artsyness of the first two films in a way. I kind of got the impression that Christopher nolan and Christian Bale were both phoning this one in, and although I've enjoyed the series overall, I'm glad it's done. DC has a lot of interesting properties, it's time to move on...
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I did like this book, kept me interested, some sex scenes were quite eccentric, might be too much for conservative folks, def a chick book.
B0091LS07E|4.0|I really enjoy this album. Alicia is evolving as a woman and artist. Brand New Me really resonates with me personally and New Day lifted my hopes for the coming year. If you are a fan, you should ike this one.
B00457WZEI|4.0|I read this book in one night and pretty much sobbed through each chapter, such a sad existence for such a wonderful animal.  Treatment of horses during the war times was so bad that I don't think i could even see the movie if its close to the book in accuracy.  Was a good read and through each chapter you were pulling for the horse and his human to be reunited.  Would reccomend to anyone who is interested in horses but be warned some parts make you cringe in the treatment of horses for mans benefit .
B005LAIHZY|5.0|Great movie for kids. Anyone who likes a good Disney flick would enjoy it. Not a musical like most Disney princess movies.
B004ZZS4CC|4.0|I was really interested in this true story and was intrigued as there was not a whole lot of press with details at the time it happened because the family was really private.  It was an easy read and I did not want to put it down.  It amazes me how this girl came out of this nightmare with such a positive outlook on life and healing by focusing on her daughters .  Some parts were disturbing of the abuse and the kidnappers sick twisted life .
0894803123|5.0|Just started using an ice cream maker for the first time since this Christmas. The recipes in the book are simple to follow and delicious! As several pointed out many of the recipes include raw eggs, if you are concerned about this you can use pasteurized eggs (I used these) or exclude the egg for a slightly less creamy ice cream.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Excellent storyline, really enjoyed all 3 books and got wrapped up in each character.  Might be a bit violent for younger kids.  Couldnt wait to see how it ended and was a touch disappointed, did have a bit of a blah ending but all in all would recommend and plan on seeing if they make a movie of 2nd and 3rd book.  (even though first book was way better than the movie)
B004UJAOLM|4.0|A good read! I have a lot of people who want to borrow it, and would if it wasn't on my KINDLE.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|Out of the three books i liked this one the least, at this point the racey scenes were getting old and you began to wonder if this couple did anything else but hop in bed all day.  The first one was better and then they went a bit downhill but i did enjoy reading them and escaping reality for a bit.  Still wishing they made the characters older so the movie will seem more believable.
B004ZZS4CC|5.0|This book is great reading I would definitely recommend it to anyone who loves to read books in their spare time.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I really liked his book and back when i was a teenager i read alot of harlequins and wished i was the female character , so this reminded me of the r-rated  version that had some explicit sex scenes in it.  Might be over the top for someone on the conservative side  .  Another cant put it down til i am done kind of book and even at the end i quickly purchased the next one to see what was around the corner.  The only complaint i had was wishing the characters were a little older  to make it more believable.  Definitely the best of the trilogy.
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Definitely not a movie for kids but hilarious none the less.  Lots of great jokes that are geared towards adults.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Definitely a great trilogy, each book equally enjoyable and basically sped through each one just to see what would happen next.<br />Story line is unique and captivating.  Cannot wait to see if this one ends up a movie.
0061122416|5.0|One of my favorite books. I am very glad that  I purchased it. I strongly recommend this book.In great condition.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Thanks, Hugh Howey for bringing me back to the world of science fiction. It has been a long time, and I wasn't sure whether or not I should lower my literary expectations. Turns out that wasn't necessary. I appreciated the gripping plot, developed characters, and insights on culture and human nature that extended well beyond the silos. Bravo!
B0060FXBNM|5.0|I watched this 3 movie set over that past week and it looked awesome in BluRay!!  I would recommend it to everyone.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Wasn't what I expected it to be and don't really care for it.  Glad I didn't buy the rest.  Will finish but not impressed.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|It's such a cute movie, how the little orphan girls change a mean mans heart!  Entertaining and fun!  You'll find yourself repeating some of the phrases in everyday life!
B008MEM24S|5.0|this is an awesome game!<br />everyone should get it. so toatly worth $0.99!! I love this game Perry is my fave character. I watch Phineas and pherb all the time.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Captivating story.  The first Vince Flynn book I have read. Hard to put it down. Great detail that makes you feel like you are right there in the story.<br />Can't wait to read more books by Vince.
0545265355|5.0|This was an amazing bargain!  Price was cheap.  Product was perfect.  Series was amazing!  Great buy!  I greatly recommend it!
B002BSHWUU|5.0|This is all of the songs the Beatles made. My husband loves it.  But who needs a review to know the Beatles are the best
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Alright its awesome I don't give a damn Ive got balls of steal I found all eight page ls now Ive have to get other good games if you have time check out 11 drunk guys play slender my voice is autotuned my voice and change it
1846467640|3.0|The books are literally 4 '' long, so small was expecting something a little bigger.  I guess I didn't read the dimensions online prior to purchasing.
B005WGBQ9G|3.0|OK, I do absolutely LOVE this show; however, I'm less than entranced by the stupidity these folks exhibit!  The whole thing with Sophia going MIA and Rick's instructions to her about what to do... and Lori?  DUH, lady!  She deserves to be eaten, for as horrible a mom as she is!  Andrea wasn't the brightest bulb in the box, either.  I just wanted to smack more than 1/2 these people!!!  It was sad. :(
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is such an addictive game. I have this game on all of my devices (phone, ipod touch, and now my kindle fire). I've been playing this game everyday! I've also got my fiance, sister and my best friend addicted to this game!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I enjoyed the book! It was  better than the movie because of the additional details included! I'm looking forward to reading the next book!
B000O8OTNC|4.0|This sharpener works much better than I expected. The ceramic groove is very fine and polishes the edge well. It isn't a strop, but it's great for in the field. The round diamond file is a little on the coarse side for serrated edges, leaving a scratched surface.
B003XCVQ3C|1.0|I plugged the adapter and HDMI cable between my IMAC and it worked for two days. Turned everything on the morning of the third day and nothing.  I haven't determined yet whether it's a problem with the adapter so I'll hold off on sending it back once I've figured out a way to test everything (not sure exactly  how to troubleshoot this).  Very frustrating.
0307352145|5.0|This is a must read for both introverts and extroverts that fail to understand why introverts are the way they are.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I love the details as you move through the story...it's like you were actually there. I highly recommend to everyone!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|My son just loves this game and so do I. We both could play for hours, we sometimes fight for the Kindle so we could play, it's that great.
0385535147|5.0|ABOUT 80% THRU THE BOOK , I COULD SEE WHERE IT WAS GOING.<br />BUT I ENJOYED THE BOOK AND READ IT IN ABOUT 2 OR 3 DAYS
B005OK721G|5.0|This was an exciting story. The cast was great.  Young Amandla is an excellent actress.  Zoe Saldana was very convincing as Catalea.  It's 'one of my favorite' movies.  Glad to have it added to my library.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|Excellent read. Kept my attention to the end. The characters were engaging,and believable. I hope these characters come back in the future
B002QE3CTY|5.0|What a great book. I read it entirely in one night because I just could not put it down. Forcing myself to wait to buy the second book until the morning is killing me. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a book that is like no other and will keep you drawn in until the very last word. Wonderful!!!!
B003F3NEBG|5.0|This is a review of the image quality more than the actual film.  I love and have always loved the film, which I believe is the best film production of Pride and Prejudice out there.  After years of watching on my battered VHS tapes, I switched to the DVD edition and was blown away.  The blu-ray edition was an exponential increase in quality.  They have gone back to the original negatives and completely rescanned, creating the best possible image quality given the type of film used.<br /><br />It's the same amazing story, but now you can see the texture of the fabric, the patterns in the flooring, the jaw-dropping beauty of Pemberly and the English countryside.  You will NOT regret buying this edition, I can't recommend it more.  I guarantee you'll be stunned when you start to notice all of the little details that you missed before (that really add depth to the already fantastic production).
B009YP9L7U|3.0|Was well written as to not be to smutty but slow in some parts still worth the read though!!<br />Very good
0743455967|5.0|I loved this book. It was a remarkable look into the writing process of one of the world's most prolific writers of fiction, and I found it to be inspiring. I like to write, and it was great to get a look at King's motivational techniques, as well as his general philosophy (which I have always wholeheartedly agreed with) that it should be FUN. If you're writing simply to make money, you're doing it for the wrong reason - and as King points out, this is almost always immediately evident in the writing itself.<br /><br />I also enjoyed reading the parts of the book that were autobiographical in nature. It was cool to see a little bit of King's world, and to see that despite his great fame and fortune (and remarkably weird concepts), he is still a human being, who takes great pleasure in the simple things, such as walking his dogs, or seeing a deer amble through his wooded backyard in beautiful Maine.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Well written book, I suppose that they could have added a little more detail but I still enjoyed reading it. Good job.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Read the text and/or have text read to you.  Narrator has excellent voice and pronunciation. Have completed one year reading and repeating next year.
B0049J0CTM|4.0|This is a perfect movie for that post-breakup period when you need something fun without a love interest-- great for all ages.
1400052181|4.0|I haven't finish reading the book but, so far I like it.  It is very informational, and lets me know what one woman went through not to long ago and how we are so blessed now.  That we have rights and that medicine has come a long way because of this one black woman.
B00AA0TJO8|4.0|Draw a Stickman: EPIC is good fun. Ridiculous as it sounds, you wind up caring a great deal for your stick man.
B009O07NMA|5.0|Love all the songs on the cd.....great new group. My husband listens to the cd every single day.<br /><br />Favorite new group.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|If you like the early John Grisham novels - you're in for a treat!  I hadn't picked up one of his books in several years, but something about The Racketeer intrigued me and I had a hard time putting it down.
B000J3OTTQ|5.0|Favorite dance movie....and it really has some good music also.  Really  love the two leading people and their chemistry is on point!
B00APUYWYA|3.0|the movie was ok, my kids loved it. But the download for the rental took FOREVER! I am not sure I will rent again if this is the typical speed.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|This book begins to wrap up the older Ryan saga while further developing the new Ryan characters.  A must read for all Clancy fans.
B0076LAF24|5.0|I really like The Chemical Brothers. This DVD can be as close as seeing them live. Really love the pictures from the book. The best of 2012 so far =)
B00867GJYK|5.0|I'm not one who re-purchases movies already in my collection, but there are a few exceptions.  Pixar films fall into this category.<br /><br />I won't spend time reviewing the movie itself, but will say that the colors on the blu-ray are much more vivid on this release than on the DVD from years ago.  The DVD quality originally released was great, but the colors always seem muted on the format.  Now, the colors truly seem to pop on the large screen televisions.<br /><br />If you're a fan of the movie, it's honestly worth it to buy this release on Blu-ray.  For an additional few dollars you get much more enjoyment from the movie by leveraging your investment in you entertainment setup at home.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Good so far but we just started so will update after I play a bit more.  Hope it is good!
B00723NWJE|4.0|Norah comes across with a different sound on this album.  She doesn't have the familiar sultry sound that we've all grown to love but it's still Norah and I like that she's experimenting.
B009S8PEHY|5.0|I had heard a couple of the songs that were on the CD, but I found the whole thing to be refreshing.  I am not a huge fan of Rod Stewart, but I really enjoyed his sultry take on old favorites.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Work, home, you name it and this app is the best for organizing and storing my thoughts and lists.  There are so many uses for this app, that I can't list all off them here, but you want to have a great place to store just about anything you may need to recall later, then get this app.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Plays on every emotion. Keeps you on your toes!! In love with this book. Incredible how the plot thickens and love prevails
B009CPJHY4|2.0|Great cast and pretty well acted.  But the story was not much to write home about.  Guess I'm a traditionalist and when the tale involves a gay man reconnecting with his lover, a wife dumping her husband, an old swinger struggling to pick up a babe for a one night stand and so forth all set in a run down Indian hotel my interest fades pretty quickly.  Whatever happened to honorable people even in old age determining to do the right thing?  Not in this movie.  Wish I had my $3.99 back.
B0012GTZC0|4.0|The book told a believable story woven around the invasion at Normandy. The characters were well developed, there was action and intrigue, a little sex and a surprise heroine.  It wasn't<br />a classic, but was an enjoyable read.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I loved this movie, and I think the soundtrack is great; however, because it is a highlights album some key songs are missing. I was particularly disappointed that they did not include &#34;Do You Hear the People Sing?&#34;, aside from the reprise in the Epilogue, but overall I really enjoy the album. I'm hoping they release the full soundtrack in the future.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wow!! I couldn't put it down!! I literally read it in a day!! What a powerful, emotional ride you go on...totally enveloped in the characters & storyline!! I felt like I actually KNEW the characters....I smiled when they smiled, laughed when they laughed, hurt & cried right along with them!! Can't wait for the next one Colleen!! Wonderful!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I watched season one with one of my daughters.  I tried to buy season two so that we could watch it together also.  Actually, when I purchased this season two,l I didn't realize that it would be a live stream on my computer.  I watched every episode on computer, but my daughter wants to get the actual DVD to watch.<br /><br />I have LOVED this series.  I love anything English or Irish, so this was right down my alley, so to speak.  I love the characters, they do an excellent job, each and everyone of them.  You know, either you love them or you love to hate them.<br /><br />I can hardly wait for season three.
1603429999|2.0|This book is for someone that is far more experienced then myself. This is for advanced knitters...Lots of informations for someone that understands it.....
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not wait until this read was complete. Usually second book of a series is a repeat of first book but not this one. Further growth of characters really made book come alive. Now to start final book.
B0074D3CAQ|5.0|The story of Harold Fry is everyone's story for we all struggle with our past.  In some ways we all have to walk over 600 miles to deal with life.
B002WJI63A|5.0|This is the real Plush and my kids love it. Practically impossible to find in the normal toy locations. Santa got them this because he's Santa and he can get any toy.
B005LAJ16I|2.0|This would be a very good series if there was not so much nudity and profanity.  I watched a couple of the discs but could not continue because it was not enjoyable with all the bad stuff.
B001FB4VXU|5.0|Shipped fast, came in great condition and my family has wasted many an hour since curled up together under blankets laughing our guts out.  This show is great!  I'm truly impressed and greatful for Amazon and the Big Bang Theory.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|The film was wonderful and the first time I did when I got home was to get the soundtrack. Worth it.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Fun game. Not too difficult, but not easy. Plenty to do, even after getting through the levels. Check the trophy room for more things to complete.
B0012GMXLU|5.0|This may be their best album. This was on the heels of a 4 year recording break forced on the band for legal reasons & maybe that's why this album is so good, they had extra time to work on the material. I know people who aren't even Motorhead fans that like this album. You should love it!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Great processor for overclocking. Great all around. Will definitlly do the job in the custom build i have going on.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read the book after seeing the movie. Both were fantastic! I couldn't put this book down. Looking forward to reading the others.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is comparable to Temple Run. However, a much richer gameplay and better social features (comparing scores with your Facebook friends) makes it the better game.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I've been waiting so long for another Harry Bosch  book. It was well worth it. My only complaint is that I wish these books were longer!
B009RH973I|3.0|I am not able to use this well as the touch screen jiggles when i use it which is not good for my eyes.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|As far as Grisham books go, its not his best work. I kept waiting for the 'kicker' or 'surprise' and never got one. Its more of just a read, rather than a mystery. I guess me reading all the Harry Bosch novels while waiting on a Grisham book got me spoiled.
B00A31UXLW|3.0|It was a long boring story with very little action not a normal Connelly story ,I will give his books a rest for a while.<br />GG
0810989956|5.0|My daughter saw this book at a book store and I knew I'd find it cheaper on Amazon and I did.  She was so happy when she opened it as a gift on Christmas.
B0081BU42O|3.0|I have been hoping for another great Culture novel since Excession, and this definitely isn't it. This long winded telling of an utterly pointless tale doesn't even come close. Might have been a decent (but not stunning) tale if not for the fact that end result is something along the lines of: \\"well... let's just act like it never happened shall we\\". Seriously? This is pretty much how the story concludes - turns out the whole thing was pointless, no story thread either enlightens us or changes anything, you feel that every character would have been better off staying at home and not bothering. The bad guys don't get punished, or even exposed, tragic deaths go unavenged - as Mr. Banks loses interest it seems his characters do too. Great writer - so-so story - lackluster ending.

He was.<br />Third, The story captivated me. I could not help becoming attached to the characters, laughing with them and feeling their pain.<br />Thank you Mr. Zusak for a beautiful story.

B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|65% of book romanticized hornet teenagers. The last gives them the maturity and unlikelihood of the rest of the book ever happening. RIDICULOUS!
B0085P2Z6E|4.0|Decent hidden object game and nice plot, though at times the plot doesn't seem to jive with the HO task.  Pinch to zoom works fine on my Nook running N2A.  Objects range from easy to find to difficult, but devs didn't just resort to hiding things in the same color background like some apps do.<br /><br />The plot, characters, graphics, etc. are a blatant rip-off of the Potter series, actually surprised the devs haven't gotten a nastygram from their lawyers to cease and desist.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|In his book, Chris opens up more than any other first-person account I've ever read to give the reader tremendous insight into his personal life/experiences.  One gains a truly personal feeling for what Chris experienced as well as his wife's perspective on many events.<br /><br />Excellent book.  Highly recommended.  The type of book once you start you can't put down.  Absolutely riveting accounts of both training and combat.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|This movie was a huge flop.  I've been hearing so many people referencing this book, so I decided to see it.  I've not read the books, and from what I've seen from the movie, I don't plan on reading them.<br /><br />This movie was very slow in building up any story, and the so called upper class looked like someone threw-up skittles all over them.  If you want a really good review on this film, see \\"how it should have ended\\", \\"hunger games\\" and its extra clip.  It'll give you more reasons why I hated this film.  Don't buy it.

159420411X|5.0|What aspects of the future are predictable?  This wide-ranging book, from an author who not only understands both data and theory but also can write engaging prose, is certainly the best non-technical discussion I have ever seen.  The empirical fact, that in many contexts predictions have turned out to be much less accurate than their makers claim, has often been made (recently in [[ASIN:0812979184 The Black Swan]], for instance), but deserves frequent repetition to counteract the media punditry to which we are all exposed.  The 13 chapters tackle different subjects via a nice combination of details and overview.  Though aimed at the general reader, even a professional statistician will find many interesting new details (for instance, I didn't know that local TV weather forecasters deliberately mis-state the probability of rain).  The chapter titles are alas more cutesy than informative, so let me list their actual topics here, which are (predictability of): mortgage defaults, elections, baseball player performance, weather, earthquakes, economic indicators, epidemics, Bayes and sports betting, chess computers, professional poker, stock market, climate change, terrorism.<br /><br />Because the point is that predictability differs in different contexts, the book wisely offers no grand theory.  From the list above of topics, you will see the author focuses on contexts where there is a lot of past data, and the central issue (his signal/noise analogy) is determining which aspects of the data are useful in predicting the future.  Using Tetlock's fox/hedgehog analogy, he advocates being a fox: \\"... pursue multiple approaches; incorporate ideas from different disciplines; see the universe as complicated, perhaps ... inherently unpredictable\\".  And he advocates \\"thinking probabilistically\\", making probabilistic rather than deterministic predictions.  Both are views I would heartily endorse.<br /><br />Silver's own technical expertise is in three of the topics (baseball player performance, poker, election prediction from opinion polls). These are particularly amenable to the signal/noise paradigm -- with lots of data and only slowly changing ground rules -- and number-crunching can lead to prediction rules that are human-interpretable. But his accounts of the other topics are equally good. Indeed I may use several of his chapters as a basis for future lectures in my Berkeley \\"Probability in the real world\\" course and will assign my (Statistics major) students to read the book.<br /><br />My main quibble concerns a glaring omission.  There is an active field, inside and outside academia, called \\"machine learning\\", which seeks to develop prediction algorithms to be numerically calculated by computer without caring if they form human-interpretable rules.  These are used in a huge range of contexts, from spotting trends in retail sales to genomic research.  But Silver makes no mention of this parallel world.  In particular, as this book notes, there is an intrinsic competitive aspect to prediction -- did my prediction work out more accurate than yours? -- which often has material consequences -- all financial speculation is in essence about predicting better than the market consensus. Machine learning has a culture of public competitions (best known being the Netflix Prize), from which we know quite a lot about how accurate its predictions can be.  So Mr Silver, please add a chapter on machine learning in the second edition.yer performance, poker, election prediction from opinion polls).

B002VPE1WK|3.0|I asked for this bag on my Amazon wish list, and someone was kind enough to purchase it. Unfortunately, I'll be returning it this week, without using it.<br /><br />It's no joke that this is for small-framed people. The hip/waist strap on my 5'11\\" frame wraps around the middle of my ribcage. And yes, I know I can just lengthen the shoulder straps...but that means the chest strap cuts right at my Adam's apple. Either way, not a comfortable fit.<br /><br />It's too bad, really...the interior is roomy, and I can see how two camera bodies and 5-8 lenses could fit. Plus the front pocket easil holds my iPad, and might even hold my 13\\" MacBook Air (though I did not try).<br /><br />I'll stick with my Lowepro slingback for now, though it's really not big enough anymore. Meanwhile, I'll search for a bag that has the capacity of this backpack, but the cut and fit for someone taller than Tom Cruise.
B009329ZF2|4.0|I always enjoy a good sci-fi movie that pits humans against aliens.  This brought a childhood favorite &#34;Battleship&#34; into the mix as well.  I wont spoil how they brought the game and the movie together but it was effective and exciting.

B000PC6A3E|5.0|Easily the finest establishing picture a comic book character has ever enjoyed. The entire first act is a masterpiece, telling the crucial parts of Bruce Wayne's fabled origin while flashing forward to key moments in his early adulthood and laying the groundwork with an almost supernatural long-term training session. It's effortlessly cool and enveloping, a perfect hook that grounds the character in reality while also pre-explaining some of his more theatrical habits. The follow-through isn't perfect, with a few puzzling plot holes and a conveniently under-explained resolution to blame, but it does such a good job of maintaining its momentum that those tripwires are easy to brush off. Of course, an industrial-sized bucketful of wonderful performances from the cast doesn't hurt. It's just loaded with big-name talent and nobody's mailing it in. Christian Bale is fantastic as the multi-layered lead character(s), but Michael Caine, Morgan Freeman, Gary Oldman and Liam Neeson are right there beside him in a wealth of glowing supporting roles. It's a dream come true for fans of the character, and a great reintroduction for casuals who'd been led astray the last iteration.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|As expected, I thoroughly enjoyed this 2nd book of Ken Follett's trilogy.<br />Fantastic new characters, as well as the ones established in Fall of Giants.<br />I felt like I was right there in every scene which is always key for me.<br />I'll be sitting tight for book 3.
1457514508|4.0|This book started very slow and it was hard to keep reading but since I had agreed to do a review I continued and was glad that I did.  It certainly picked up speed after the first few chapters.  Sometimes it was hard to remember who was who, almost too many characters.  This is a good mystery but certainly hard to retell to anyone.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Tons of fun.  My kids love it, and it didn't take long for them to get the hang of it.<br />The Year of the Dragon is especially cool.  Great sound experience too.  They<br />can't get enough of it.  Little secret...I dig it too.
B009LK6JS2|4.0|This simulator is very real. I just wish it had more scenarios. I would recommend it. Provides endless fun for killing time.
B004X6PRO6|5.0|My son gave me this book for my birthday.  I have to admit, that is what kept me reading, for the horrors in the first 50 pages or so were so  disturbing to someone who is a pacifist, that I did not know if I could finish it. For days I could hear the howling of the dog left alone on the beach after his master was kidnapped.<br /><br />THEN, I became hooked.  I could not put the book down, and sat down and read it in two days. The writing compelled me to find out what happened to Jun Do.  The horrors did not lessen, but Jun Do became more human.  There were actually light scenes in the book that helped to mitigate the dark torturous ones.  In the end, it is Jun Do's transformation and selflessness that one remembers.  If someone had told me about this book, I would have responded, \\"No thank you,\\"  but I am glad that I made it to the other end.<br /><br /> I am glad to have a better understanding of North Korea other than it is a place that no one wants to be.  I still would not want to be there, but I have a greater appreciation for my own freedom after reading this book.  I have a greater regard for those who have to travel the road of Jun Doe, or part of that road every day of their lives. It also makes one think of just exactly what propaganda  our government feeds us.  Books are supposed to enlighten us, and this one does about a subject that most of us know nothing about.
0547884591|3.0|This was the only thing I asked for at Christmas time as I am not a fan of the materialism and getting a bunch of stuff I don't really need. However, I like Tim's writing style and I thought he was pretty in depth and informative in his last two books so I wanted to see how this one turned out.<br /><br />First off I will admit that I was disappointed with the cooking aspect of the book. I had/have little interest in that aspect of it. I knew that \\"meta-learning\\" would be in the book so that is why I wanted to get it. He sold me even more with all the \\"this isn't REALLY about cooking stuff\\"... well, there are about 12lbs worth of paper in this book that I have no interest in because it is mostly cooking.<br /><br />The stuff I did want to read was not very in depth and scattered. The first two reviews I saw here were also three stars and said a lot of the same things: \\"manic, scattered, like a magazine filled with bricks, etc\\". I felt the same way so I thought I'd let others know that this really is what they are in for.<br /><br />MY BIGGEST ISSUE:<br />Tim Ferriss has made his whole \\"schtick\\" about simplifying and making things easier but it seems that he wants to make his books progressively bigger and more complex. It seems hypocritical.<br /><br />This book is like when your favorite band \\"sells-out\\". They still might be good, but they've been watered down and over hyped for the masses.

145210655X|5.0|My boys (ages 4 and 1) bought this for my husband for Christmas. My oldest son has been very excited about the book as he has recently discovered the Star Wars movies. There is a lot of great parenting humor in the book and it is enjoyable to read. Even my 4 year old has laughed about some of the situations Darth Vader finds himself in with a young Luke!

1607066017|3.0|Since I like to see what's going on in a world of comics all around the globe, sooner or later I pick something from some Bestseller-list. I rarely find something good there though I do persist. It has its uses, especially if you dabble in some form of \\"serious\\" writing. One can learn a lot from popular books, whether one is an aspiring writer or one just tries to comprehend what's going on in a dear medium in a certain place. This way of exploration eventually lead me to Brian K. Vaughan's \\"Saga\\", book about which I heard many things. Mostly good ones.<br /><br /> My prior experiences with worlds of Brian K. Vaughan were few. I've read an entire run of \\"Y: The last man\\" and was vastly disappointed by the second half of the series. I've watched an entire run of the \\"Lost\\" which eventually lead to the thoughts Adolf Hitler would've been ashamed of (still think that final season of that show should be prohibited by law). And that's about it. I was never especially interested in his more mainstream work with Marvel/DC, and never quite found the time to read \\"Ex-Machina\\". After the experience of the \\"Saga\\", I probably won't bother at all.<br /><br />  Since I had no expectations of this book, I can't say that I was disappointed by it. I wasn't. My feelings and thoughts could more precisely be summarized as - meh. It's a good book - to a degree - though a fairly average one in both of its aspects. Storytelling, with its straightforward narration, in-your-face- gender/politics activism, and rather conventional type of characters, was rather bland (somewhat bizarre humor helps a bit). Art, with its profound lack of interest in world-building background, Moebius-influenced design (The Will character lacks just a metallic ear to be a spitting image of the Metabaron), and rather crude ink was pretty boring (though Fiona Staples knows how to tell a story and some close-ups and panel breakdowns are splendid indeed) and uninteresting. If I was reading this issue by issue, I would've probably stopped after #3. TPB managed to keep me interested. Barely.<br /><br /> I guess it all boils down to what will happen next. In six issues Vaughan and Staples managed to create a world whose blanks yet need to be filled. Characters, events, places and all-encompassing-Story are presented in rather sketchy and somewhat broad manner. From a narrative point of an entire run it makes perfect sense. By doing so Vaughan left himself some wriggling space which he can update as needed. From a single-issue (TPB) standpoint, this kind of narration can lead in two directions. Either it manages to provoke some interest or it manages to provoke some irritation. For now, I balance somewhere in the middle. Drawing from the experience of \\"Y: The Last Man\\" - which dissolved into utter b*s*** towards the end - I'm fairly skeptical about Vaughan's ability to write something other than simplistic and naïve (with a bit of shock value for shock value sake) genre-tale. I still believe in surprises though. From this point on \\"Saga\\" can go anywhere. It will be interesting to see where exactly will that be.opped after #3. TPB managed to keep me interested.

B008KW43TE|5.0|Channel Orange is honest, heartfelt R&B the way R&B is meant to be played.  In a sea of auto-tuned pop songs and overproduced R&B, this one is unique.  Frank Ocean does not try too hard to appeal to everyone, and therein lies his appeal; nor does he hide his insecurites and weaknesses, either musically or lyrically.  This is a rare gem that avoids all of the pitfalls so common today.  This is music played warmly and sincerely, without feeling sentimental or retro -- this is definitely the music of 2012.<br /><br />When it was first released, I downloaded the mp3 album and was immediately hooked.  I played this on repeat.  The more I listened to it, the more it grew on me, and I still listen to it quite often today.  This never gets old.  In fact, I just ordered the LP as this is one that is definitely worth owning on vinyl.
B007MU85D0|5.0|I love this band, they are a new favorite, and this album rocks. Wish I had a vinyl copy. All of the songs are good even the ones not playing on pandora. Could not newline I got it for $3!  Check them out!

B008DKBO8G|5.0|love this sleeve!  it's not too bulky.  it's durable, has a nice size velcro closure, and looks good too.  i liked mine so much that i bought this one for my mom.
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I saw this in the theater and couldn't wait for it to come out on DVD/Blu-Ray. I am definitely a chick flick, comedy type person and this definitely met my expectations. I am not a Glee fan at all... but think those who like Glee would get a kick out of this movie as well.
B009POCG5Y|5.0|This is a fantastic movie that is about more than baseball.  It is about a man and his struggles both professionally and family.  The movie works through his problems as he deals with old age and the pains of having failed his daughter at a very young age.<br /><br />This movie works sports (baseball) into a love story, with family conflict.  I would recommend this to everyone.

Great story.  Great message.

B00846REIS|4.0|After reading 50 shades, I was looking for something similar and read the reviews on this book and decided to give it a shot. I was pleasantly surprised that I was so into the book. I read it in two nights. Once I started reading I didnt want to put it down. Glad there was a second book to continue reading, but am bummed that the third book doesnt come out for a couple of months. Still the book is a pretty good read!
B000WGWQG8|5.0|This is a great collection to have if you enjoy American history. Paul Giamatti And Laura Linney are fantastic in this miniseries. The wife and I loved it. Loaned it to my older brother and his wife and tyhe watched every episode back to back one evening. They were riveted.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|This movie was so crude...my husband and I stopped watching it after maybe the first 20 minutes.  Did not enjoy it at all.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I bought this as a gift and it was great. Great value for your money. I had looked at getting just &#34;The Dark Knight&#34; but saw the trilogy box and decided to get it instead.  You get three great movies for the price of 1 at any retail store!!
B009J2VR3Y|5.0|i love to sing to her music,i have always loved her music and her movies.whitney is my heart and music.
B004ODLUF8|2.0|I thought it would be full of photos taken from the Hubble......views of nebula.  NOT. Seeing IMAX I thought it was going to be 3D or high def. My fault for not looking more closely.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|Cool game the masked man comes back to whip some tail. Though I don't understand why the chief of daily bugle isn't on his butt
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Great read. Loved it! I would definitely recommend this book. It was a page turner. Very sweet and romantic with a little bit of suspense.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|fits in my pocket, sharpens well and is easy to use. Leaves a nice sharp edge on the blade after a few swipes.
B005HSL626|5.0|This app is so much fun, even the little kids like it as much as us adults.  They don't want to put it down.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was exciting the whole way through. It had.  Very good story line that always kept me guessing. Awesome
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Clint Eastwood has created another moving story about the prejudice culture we have and how it is overcome. Loved it.
B009WO7NQO|4.0|I can see why this game is so popular now that I've played it. It's easily accessable with some hidden depths. Fun for a mobile game and I'm glad I picked it up. I wish there was more to it but it's good for what it is.
B00973902K|5.0|This is the cutest song I've heard in a long time. I actually saw videos of some parodies before I saw her actual video. The parodies were cute, but the original was adorable!
B000FC2KL0|5.0|I read this book for an English project, and I thought was a very good read. Although a little on the long side, I would recommend this book to anyone who listens to the Red Hot Chili Peppers and/or would like to more about their road to fame through the eyes of Anthony Kiedis. Well, actually I'd be lying if I said the WHOLE thing was about the RHCP becoming famous. It is actually about Anthony's struggle with his drug addiction. I felt that this was a good read because as the story progresses, you feel a connection to Anthony because he never makes excuses for his actions, he just tells how things happened with little bias.<br />Overall great book!(:
B00846REIS|3.0|This is an easy read that is probably very similar to Shades of Gray.  I thought it would be fun to read something light and undemanding; this filled the bill.  I usually pick books based on their educational value or the high quality of writing.  This one has neither but it was enjoyable and effortless to pick up and read a few minutes at a time during my daily commute.
B002WY65UQ|4.0|I liked it so much I bought it as a gift. As a former field hockey player, how could I not like it.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|This movie was a bad one, too much dark magic and witchcraft and the fact that is directed towards the mom I did not like.<br />It makes me wonder why are this movies such a negative ..It worries me as a caring parent like me who wants to protect the mind of her children the bad influence that this movies might have in a child's mind.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Most people want to read a book because the cover looks cool or they read the summary and thought it was really good but found out later on that it wasn't . Well this book has both of those things. They cover is amazing and the book it self was even more amazing. If you must read a book, please read this one.
B00316DDWW|4.0|This album had ok flow to it and most of the songs were catchy with the exception of 2 or 3 that didn't really scratch me where I itched. It is balanced in song varieties and I love the progressive feel with the odd meters and the catchy guitar leads over heavy bass lines. I didn't like the way it was mastered - it's not very clear sounding when turned up very loud (if you're not extremely finicky about sound quality you probably won't notice - that means all of you out there that think that .wma and .mp3 is just as good as CD quality or vinyl)
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is the<br /> first book I have read cover to cover in a long time. It kept me on the  edge of my seat and I read it in one day!
034580404X|3.0|She read the books for a bit then they got set aside, alot of hype and not much for results here.
0786868694|5.0|Easy read, great pictures, simple menu items.  My wife love's her show and this is a great companion to the show.
B007JMW46U|5.0|This was a solid read, though reading through Doyle's longer works about Sherlock is recommended first.  These short stories seem abrupt without the longer works giving depth to the characters.
B00AEJM6H2|4.0|Great game to kill time while you are waiting in line or while traveling between destinations.  Keeps you mind off of the wait.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|I've seen many versions of the Christmas Carol.  I enjoyed reading it in the original the best, though.  There were some points that I was simply not aware of and some content that I can understand why movie producers would avoid.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|I have to admit that, because this movie is about a Princess, I expected a typical Disney tale about a heroine who has very Big Hair. I was pleasantly surprised that the movie is unconventional enough to hold the attention of a jaded adult. This is a Pixar movie, and it is entertaining on different levels at the same time. As a parent who has juggled multiple children and pets, some of the family scenes reminded me of my own household so much that I had a laughing fit.
B006TTC54A|5.0|I owned dvd but not blu-ray. love the movie. great addition to colection of movies. Classic movie and now I have the bluray quality
B009X01C64|5.0|These cases are an excellent addition to your Kindle Fire HD 8.9&#34;.  A must have.  They're sturdy, classy looking (they don't look cheap), and when you prop them open to read it words like a charm.  Hands free.  I love the elastic band that holds it shut.  I have to mention again that they're very nice looking.  I'm so glad I purchased one for each of us (3 different colors).
B0063IH60K|5.0|I play it on Kindel Fire U D. Nice graphics, very responsive. Don't like ads before every game, but I can live with that, after all. . . It's free.
0061692042|5.0|This is a great book.  I couldn't stop turning the pages although the &#34;action&#34; was quite slow.  This is his best book ever.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is awesome! Love it! I just downloaded it and can't put it down!! I would recommend this game!
B00A12VJZM|5.0|Any band today would just wish to have written ONE of these songs! Don't<br />care for some of the truncated versions, though. The Stones found their<br />sound by &#34;The last Time.&#34; The rest, my friends, is rock n' roll history.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Great game, I Love playing it. The ads aren't so bad. It's easy to use also. I would recommend it.
B008QTV3X0|4.0|Really fun show on the topic of National Security, great cast and really solid story threads to follow, I would definitely recommend watching the pilot.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abbey is full of intrigue!  Also shows daily life in that era for lords, ladies, footmen, valets, butlers and scoundrels!  Love seeing the decor and the style of dress...and hearing English spoken as the English speak it!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|I absolutely love Gillian Flynn's novels.  Gone Girl & Dark Places were excellent reads.  Sharp Objects was not as exciting or as interesting as the two novels.
B009H442DG|3.0|...and some of it is well-deserved. Travolta just isn't a singer, and every song would have been better without his vocals. Olivia is wonderful, as always, but this is her THIRD Christmas CD. I love Olivia and I love Christmas music, but enough is enough, Olivia. It's time to move on to another genre.
B001OSIV62|2.0|Interesting but could have been done in 30 mins.  Fast forwarded and watched in about 15 mins.  I got the point
B009MCRHH6|5.0|Simply amazing. From the great gameplay, funny visuals, challenging puzzles, quirky signs, and an excellent story, it is impossible not to like this gala game.
B00AFWEPVI|1.0|May be just me, but it seemed very ackward to try and take a picture. The photo also was very fuzzy.  i was wondering if this was meant to be used with the skype.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|Season 2 is when things really start kicking off for this show. The transfer quality of this season seems markedly better than the first, which makes sense. The extras are phenomenal, and the cast reunion is a joy to watch (even though Marina Sirtis talks too much). Overall, if you're a TNG fan, this is a must buy!
B000KFB4PK|1.0|I bought this watch for Christmas and it broke on New Year!! The back side broke leaving the battery and the mechanism bare.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I learned a lot about hiking and hikers. I don't understand how hiking or getting away helps resolve emotional issues. It is well written and interesting.
B001TODCII|5.0|This was an awesome $1.99 buy on black friday.  I cant believe Amazon offered it so cheap.  Great movie for anyone who hasn't seen it yet.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was a fantastic book and was so much better than the movie so much more insight to Katniss and her thoughts and everything definitely recommend it.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Absolute a great book I couldn't put it down once I got halfway with surprises ans more surprises I would recommend this book
B004V5A7K8|5.0|Classic in the lines of Pong.  Great game for all ages.  I don't play first person games, generally preferring card or casino games, but this one is a lot of fun.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|As a die hard fan of the original television version of Dark Shadows, I was prepared to be disappointed in this film.  However, that was not the case.  So what if Tim Burton, Johnny Depp and the other makers took creative license?!  That's what makes this version interesting. Also, as a kid who ran home from the bus stop everyday to see the last ten minutes of each and every show, I was pleased that some of those loose ends were tied up with a bow in this version and poor, sad, lonely Barnabas finally had some justice and a  possible chance at happiness.  It also tickled me to see some of the original cast members from the original series given a chance to participate.  Some people may not 'get' this film, but lovers of the original series will. And I was not offended in the least to have the opportunity to laugh.  Way to go, guys.
B009H442DG|3.0|Loved them in Grease but not so much in this albumn.  I love John but he should stick to acting.
B00571F26Y|5.0|This book has changed my life. As a type 2 diabetic I ate whole grains  and I exercised but I couldn't trim my belly.  Now that I have virtually eliminated wheat from my diet I have lost 7lbs in 2 weeks. My constant craving for carbs is completely gone. I am now craving raw veggies, fruit and other healthy foods. JUST READ THIS BOOK.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a user-friendly, idiot proof, well designed app that brings the Bible to life! It enhances what is already awesome about the Bible and improves on availability, ease of search, assistance looking up a tricky verse and even offers SO many different translations that it might be hard to find ANYONE that could find fault with this product! If you are a student of the Bible or just someone who wants a little help with the &quot;good book&quot;, this is the app for you! And its a perfect time of year to download it...They have SO many different reading plans, that fit a variety of busy schedules. You'll find just the right reading plan that will guide you to reading the entire Bible in a year, six months or at whatever pace you set for yourself. What are you doing still wasting time on what I say? Its free AND awesome...download it NOW! :-)
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hoover expertly handles tough subject matter while sharing a gut-wrenching story about unconditional love.  Couldn't put the book down.....Bravo!  Job well done!
B005HSG3VK|1.0|I couldn't get my Kindle to fit into the cover.  I stopped trying to get the Kindle into the cover because I was afraid of damaging my Kindle.
B005XN31LY|5.0|I am SO delighted with this season, will be getting the rest ASAP!!! This is entertaining,thoughtful & I hope last for years. LOVE the cast!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Hopeless is a great story with twist and turns you think you will never understand but you do. I fell inlove with Holder. He was nice and sweet. He wanted to treat Sky like broken glass. I am glad he did so. Its heart warming and makes you want to laugh and cry. The ending is bitter sweet. This is a great book  I never wanted to put down , i finshed in a day. Collen Hoover is  a great writer. This is a must read!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This was one of the best books I've read. Easily one of my favorites. I would absolutely recommend this book, and if I could give it 6 stars I absolutely would!!!
B001BFFTO0|5.0|I just received my new pair of these boots so I am writing this review without much wear.  Nevertheless, I wanted to say that my first impression is very positive.  I read the existing reviews before purchasing.  Of particular benefit was the advice on sizing.  I normally wear an 8.5 D in street shoes and most athletic shoes.  Lately, in cowboy boots I have bought size 9 D for a good fit.  So, when I saw folks recommending buying a full size smaller than normal in these boots I really paused.  It was hard to take the advice really.  But I did and bought a size 8 D.  With Thorlo boot sox on with fairly think footbed, I have plenty of room.  So I would recommend buying at least 1/2 size to full size smaller on this boot.  The construction and leather are great.  The boots appearance is just like pictured only better on your foot.  Great look in jeans. Comfortable right out of the box.  At this point 5 star rating.  If I have any issues to adjust, I will come back here.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Good graphics and layout. Easy enough for kids to play while still being entertaining for adults. Overall good purchase. Would recommend to others.
1401323820|5.0|We are great &#34;Castle&#34; fans and never miss the tv programs, so this series of books were perfect gifts.  Would recommend to those who like &#34;Castle&#34; and mysteries.
B00A11AN6O|1.0|just force closes for me. kind of frustrating, maybe they need to update it to be compatiable with newer version of Android. i don't know, i have Ice Cream Sandwich
1401324029|5.0|We are great &#34;Castle&#34; fans and never miss the tv programs, so this series of books were perfect gifts.  Would recommend to those who like &#34;Castle&#34; and mysteries.
B00AA0TJO8|3.0|It definitely kills time, in a fun way.<br />The puzzle game part is just weird. And don't like that to get 'hints' there you have to message them on Facebook. Really?
0316098329|5.0|This is a great book and my students love it.  It really appeals to young adults.  It rarely remains on the shelf.
B008AT71WI|5.0|I heard about this very close to Christmas and knew my daughter would be crazy about it.  It was the only thing I truly surprised her with.  Extremely fast delivery as always.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|I like Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones but this movies is a train wreck. The leads are not characters, they're caricatures. This is about a couple who have drifted after 30 years of marriage but instead of digging into their relationship the movie sends the message that all they need to do is resume their sex life and everything will be fine. Plus the soundtrack gets intrusive quickly -- every scene seems to have ts own song.<br /><br />DO NO WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Games of this caliber are not easy to find. Many are hit and miss but this one is great. Graphics are great and the story is easy to follow.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|This is the best app ever!!!! It's worth the 99&cent; it's so fun u can play it all day if u want 2 &amp; have the time 2!!!!!! I know I would!!!!!!!!!!!!! Get BAG IT!!!
B0053YGYO4|4.0|I liked the album a lot, but some of the songs have still not gotten stuck in my head! I love Coldplay anyway!
B0021L9MJG|5.0|Years have passed and the picture quality is great (well, you can expect some grain). The stories are amazing. I wished some nice extras and some more languages could be added. But a nice addition to the collection.
B000W91RUG|5.0|The Big Bang Theory's first season is one of the funniest and most entertaining sitcoms tbat I have ever seen. It establishes all characters and why they are they way they are.My 11 year old daughter and I watch this over and over.
B0085A9HXS|5.0|Yeah, the blueprint for an action movie, this is without a doubt a nice movie, full of action and while simple on the story, intrincate in the development. You gotta love a movie that offers you fun and chunks of actions. Never underestimate your enemy.
B005LAIHEA|2.0|I love Jason Segel and Emily Blunt. There was just no chemistry between them; at least I didn't feel it. &#34;I Love You Man&#34; was awful too. Forgetting Sarah Marshall was somewhat OK. I don't know if Jason is cut out to be a leading man. He's funny in other movies where he is not the main character.
B004ZJZQJC|4.0|Wow, this looks so good on bluray, some of the graphics are yes, textureless but that's something that's there to remind you this is one of those movies that started the FX avalanche.<br />Who doesn't love the Last Starfighter?
B0029XFN8A|1.0|This movie feels like it followed the same hollywood formula. There were no memorable scenes. The acting was not atrocious, but it was very good.
B003IY48PS|4.0|Containing the movie in widescreen and Full Frame (original version) is pure gold.<br />Sound and picture quality es the best you can get from this version. a big leap from the VHS or DVD.<br />I love this movie.
B0086700CM|4.0|A great and fun way to kill time. Seeing it is free, there is pretty much no reason to not give it a try
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book.  Telling the story from the perspective of a dog was genius!  I believe that any woman would enjoy reading The Art of Racing in the Rain.
B006CHML4I|4.0|Exactly as pictured, my son loves it. would recommend it for those who like Seiko watches. color good as well
B00A0ABQLM|4.0|I got the Anker USB 3.0 Gigabit Ethernet Adapter specifically so I could use it with a Raspberry Pi.  Unfortunately, the included Installation CD does not include binaries for any Linux Distribution, which just happens to be the OS of choice for the Raspberry Pi.  Being too lazy to attempt to get it working on Linux using standard Linux drivers, I decided to test it out on my laptop.<br />I started by turning off all my internet then simply plugging the device into my USB port, and immediately Windows XP recognized a new device and started searching for an appropriate device driver.  Unfortunately, the device isn't fully plug-n-play compatible because Windows was unable to find a driver without online access.  However, once I turned my wireless card back on it found an appropriate device driver.<br />Take note that I did not use the included installation CD because I wanted to test its plug-n-play compatibility.  Without already having internet access, you would have to use the included mini-CD to install the necessary device drivers for Windows or the Mac.<br />Once I had the device drivers installed, I plugged in an Ethernet cord and turned my wireless back off to see how fast it was.  I measured my speed using [...] and compared the results to what I normally get using my built-in Ethernet adapter and wireless.  Using Anker's Ethernet dongle I achieved speeds similar to what my internal Ethernet adapter achieved, which is a little bit faster than my built-in wireless adapter.<br /> I would definitely recommend this product to anyone that is intending to add additional Ethernet ports to a laptop or otherwise enclosed USB capable device.  I cannot yet recommend using it on a Raspberry Pi, because there were no Linux drivers included on the media and I haven't yet tried to see if I could get it to work.<br />Even as a simple, minimal install device to add additional Ethernet ports to your desktop, this device is highly comparable to other installed Ethernet cards, and is small enough to fit inside your pocket.  I definitely suggest using a USB 3.0 enabled port when using this device, but it will work with older ports.  My tests were using a USB 2.0 port on a Windows XP machine.nd is small enough to fit inside your pocket.

0316187216|4.0|Review of Red Country by Joe Abercrombie<br /><br />Abercrombie continues to challenge the genre, this time giving us an epic fantasy Western replete with pioneers, sword-slingers, grudges and showdowns. There's a nice thread of irony running throughout, which is particularly well served by having one of the characters be a writer with a distaste for rivals and critics.<br /><br />The characters are memorable, one or two of them wolves in sheeps' clothing. There was a clever use of the diminished actor, Lestek, who reminded me throughout of Uncle Monty from Withnail and I.<br /><br />Point of view is strong throughout, with Abercrombie demonstrating his flare for dialect. The characters' particular idiosyncrasies of speech and grammar find their way into the narrative portions of their scenes. Due to the relatively large number of points of view, this sometimes made finding a rhythm difficult for me; I frequently had to re-read lines to understand the meaning. The longer Abercrombie stuck with a particular character, the easier it was to grow used to that character's way of speaking.<br /><br />Temple and Shy are the stars of the piece and both are keenly observed and multi-faceted. Readers of Abercrombie's other works will recognize Lamb of old, but he's used skillfully and racks up the drama considerably.<br /><br />As usual there are some nice tie ins with the other books Abercrombie has written -- little references to other characters that raise a smile here and there. This serves to give the impression of a deep, convincing world inhabited by believable characters.<br /><br />The basic plot was perhaps a bit restrictive, but not nearly as much as the revengers' theme of Best Served Cold. It does allow for some clever twists and good use of irony through multiple points of view, and in any case, it achieves what the author sets out to do.<br /><br />Another pioneering work from one of the most interesting fantasy writers of the last decade.
B004WGGQPQ|5.0|hello it helps me draw and be more better of a artist because I want to be one when I grow up.
141694737X|5.0|One of my baby's favorite book.  Interaction keeps her listening.  Just wish that it wasn't so pricey for a board book.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|This app allows you to quickly check your Facebook page without having to log in through Safari.  So far, I am having no problems with it.
B0081L37Z0|5.0|If you're into comedy you'll enjoy these two. Action and comedy filled and will keep you busy and not bored.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I bought this book because I wanted to see the movie and it had already left my local theaters.  Thank goodness, there is no way that the movie can hold up to the emotional tug of war that this book was.  I absolutely loved it!
B00948EPOQ|4.0|Funny, sweet and surprisingly thoughtful, with a nice performance by Owen Wilson. If you like this movie, you might enjoy Alan Rudolph's edgier take on some of the same material, The Moderns.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|It had the potential to be qurky cute, sort of like Tom Hanks in &#34;Big&#34;. But it was sooo vulgar & scatalogical that I didn't even finish watching it. Am a big fan of Seth McFarlane but he is so much wittier and brilliant than this movie. I give it 2 stars because I knew it would be over the top and smutty...otherwise I would have given it a 1.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I thought this book was quite well written, but then I am a fan of historical fiction. Quite long, though.
B004MC8CA2|1.0|I' 've used YouVersion for reading the bible in a year.  It' s great to have the plans for<br /> a year' s reading or different versions at your fingertips.
B000E0WJIC|5.0|I have a wide variety of different bands i listen to, these guys are deffinately one of my favorites. There songs dont all sound the same and i like that. When you here them you know who they are.
0547884591|5.0|I have always dabbled with adjusting ingredients in recipes to suit my family's tastes and enjoyed experimenting with new ingredients.  The 4-Hour Chef is just what I need to take my culinary fun to a much higher level.  Beyond cooking, Timothy's clear descriptions of his learning process, and amazing applications of his techniques to all aspects of his life, are very inspiring and applicable to anyone at any age who wants to have a more enriching life.  Thank you to Isabel De Los Rios and her Beyond Diet Newsletter for recommending this book.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|This movie is not as good as the first but still very enjoyable.  The story was good and the ending sastisfying.
B0079XPUOW|2.0|this is basically a concept that must have been dreamed up while toking with a bunch of friends. It is like an SNL skit that has one premise and goes on way past its natural limit of comedy and cleverness.
B006X415GK|5.0|My niece absolutely loved this doll. The fact that she is in black and white, including the packaging was very unique. Great Christmas gift.
B00005JNQS|5.0|Enjoyable movie for children and adults, my son received this movie for Christmas and enjoys watching the movie again and again!
145210655X|5.0|This book is hilarious. I just had a baby and his name...Luke. So I bought this for my husband as a gift from him, for Christmas. I expected the book to be all hard pages, and they weren't. I also expected the book to only be about 8 pages, and it wasn't. It was a lot longer than I expected. It's really funny. It's basically Luke, driving Darth Vader nuts.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|This is mine and my son's favorite action movie ever!!!!  Went and saw the Avengers at the show and had to have at home to enjoy!!!!  MUST HAVE MOVIE!!!!!
B001GCUNYO|5.0|This movie is AWESOME! The first time I saw it, I was on the edge of my seat. Totally makes you want to make smarter decisions when traveling.
B003CSV7TK|5.0|For all Christmas lover's this Movie is a must-have for your collection.  This movie is enjoyable and will be loved by your whole family!
0763644765|3.0|I like the fact that this book is all hard pages. It's a very simple book. I bought it for obvious reasons. To show my 2 year old &#34;where and how&#34; to use the potty. I can't say this book helped with that. I bought 3 &#34;poop&#34; books. And this one he always grabbed last. And didn't even always grab it. So it must not have interested him. As an adult, I didn't really care for this book. I did like the simplicity of it. But the words in the book were much to be desired. There just wasn't much to read except ewwws and aahhhhs. Literally.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|My son received this movie for Christmas and this is his favorite movie ever!  He watches this movie over and over!!
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I get that this was written by a doctor but it just seems very mystical not spiritual to me.  As some one has read many accounts on the subject there are many key elements that don't line up.
B008XG1X18|2.0|I just loaded this app to my kindle &amp; it hardly works. it keeps freezing &amp; is too touchy. I love pintrest, but I guess I'll have to access it from my laptop.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|My wife and I just rented this from Amazon Instant Video.  It was not funny, meaning 3-4 out of every 5 jokes was not funny, or way overdone.  Kind of a shame since the premise is a great one.  The problem with Seth Macfarlane in our opinion is two-fold.<br />First, he is doing an R-rated movie opposed to a TV show, so took every chance to swear or be over the top as possible.  The South Park guys did this, too, but the South Park and Team America movies were for the most part, funnier than this result.<br />And second - the \\"Jar Jar syndrome\\"... Seth is King of his Hill with a hit TV show and fans who love anything he does no matter what, right or wrong, funny or not.  So what do you get?  Self serving comedy that isn't broad enough for anybody but those crazed fans.  And just like George Lucas never got told Jar Jar was ridiculous and would kill the franchise, nobody would probably tell SM anything he was doing wasn't funny because he's just suuuch a genious.<br />I did find the narration by Patrick Stewart to be a high point... and that bit about Brandon Routh... RIGHT ON!
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|If you've never read a Jodi Picoult book, this one will get you hooked.  I enjoyed the book very much.
B0058YPLA2|5.0|My mom loved this show and was so happy with this for christmas, great deal and well worth the price
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|The story line was great, the characters were great, and the books were all easy to follow.  Getting to buy the entire trilogy at once was a great deal.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Really great book, especially for those of us with a nerdy side dedicated to video games, dorky movies, and the old rock music. I highly recommend what was a pretty quick read.<br /><br />FYI, it may take a little while to get engrossed, but once you're there the book turns into a lot of fun. Some plot point seemed forced, and it's not the most well developed future world, but it's a killer first novel - and for that Ernest Cline gets a big pair of thumbs up.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Nicholas Sparks fans would love this book, and if you haven't read one of his books yet, this one will get you hooked.
1451648537|5.0|I won't bore you with another review - just read the book. If you have an interest in technology, innovation, and the enigmatic character that was Steve Jobs, you will not be disappointed.
B0038M2AZA|4.0|Adds knowledge about autism and how it leads her to insite to animals we all deal with from time to time
0307887898|4.0|I have been on a bit of an entrepreneurial bender recently and got a strong recommendation to pick this one up. Loved the material and see all kinds of ways to apply what I've learned in my own enterprising adventures as well as my corporate job. The concept of a minimum value proposition, constant iteration, and the build/measure/learn cycle really hit home for me.<br /><br />The one criticism I have is the way in which Eric Ries lays out his work. I felt like the first half of the book was a build up for something that developed more like a slow leak than a big payoff. Maybe I'm the only one who felt like the book could have handle one more pass through an editor, but alas.<br /><br />This is one I hope to revisit on occasion. To really get the value out of The Lean Startup I hope to kick off a couple projects and put it to the test.
B000YHG72E|5.0|A few years back this became my new must watch Christmas movie.  If you like Will Ferrell, you'll absolutely love this movie.
B003K16P3M|2.0|The &#34;magic system&#34; is interesting and there are a couple characters of interest, but the book is mediocre. I stopped caring about the main characters early on and that's where this story ultimately classifies itself as a miss. Don't waste your time.
B003G4W49C|5.0|A very good book. It was hard for me to put down and is a page turner. It has many surprises to it.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I'm 100% the target audience for this movie... I love action flicks, I grew up reading Captain America/Thor/Iron Man/Hulk/The Avengers, and I have become a fan of all of the actors in the films (as well as the director). The Avengers was one win after another, and I have only the smallest of fanboy criticisms coming out of it. Hands down my favorite movie of 2012, even with incredibly stong showings from other films like the Hobbit, The Dark Knight Rises, Lincoln, etc...<br /><br />I didn't say it's the BEST movie of 2012, just my favorite.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I think this game is really fun but it is also very time consuming as it is highly addictive but still very fun
1400032717|4.0|A very quick, but satisfying read. This provides a unique look into the life of one who has autism and struggles to make connections as to what is going on in the world around him. A couple big twists that weren't terribly difficult to put together as the reader, but you sympathize and hope that Christopher will figure things out as well.<br /><br />Great choice for a quick holiday break read.
B009A3NGF4|5.0|I was already a fan of Mumford & Sons, but the latest album has only increased my admiration for the group. The energy and unique sounds are captivating. This has quickly become a favorite in our home.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This book was set up differently than I expected, but we'll written. Enjoyed it. Mental illness and family issues need to be  discussed more.
B00A7ZXDLQ|5.0|Wow I am pretty impressed! Rihanna did a very good job with the album, but not all of the songs showcase her voice in the best possible way. However, the songs are all very good lyrically and there are a lot of catchy ones! My favorites are Diamonds, No Love Allowed, Lost In Paradise, and Love Without Tragedy/Mother Mary.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is entirely fun and you definitely don't need to buy anything which is very nice. You get stars by connecting the characters on certain tiles on the ground. With these stars you can unlock more levels.<br />My advice is to get all the stars you possibly can so you don't have to redo levels to get the stars. Not that it really matters. It's fun, actually.<br />  I really recommend getting this game. Lots of fun!
B00A77II0U|5.0|A great game.I play a lot of<br /> games like this and I enjoyed it very much. Looks great on the new kendle HD. Hope to see more games like this.
B0097GVJWQ|1.0|I was able to download the free app & I liked the game so I bought the $2.99 app & this one wond download keeps giving me an error.  This is for my Kindle Fire.  I would like to know why it wont download & what the makers are going to do about it.
B0084IG8TM|1.0|\\"The Hunger Games\\" could be the most pathetic, ridiculous, laughable cinematic effort I've ever seen.<br />In fact, if the reek from this crap could be put into a canister, I believe it would qualify as a Weapon of Mass Destruction.<br />As a rule, I'm a sucker for futuristic, post-apocalyptic films.  And therefore am predisposed to forgive many a flaw in them.<br />But, I'm sorry.  Can't do that with \\"The Hunger Games.\\"<br />I guess I should admit that I never read the book.  So, perhaps the thing about the film that most irritated me was filmed as originally written.  In any case, though, the makers of this film lost me at once when they opted to portray the elites, the ruling class, as cartoonish human manifestations of bad taste.  All of them looked Bozo-The-Clownish as seen on an acid trip.  And their preferred decor was just as bad.  All of which had the effect of making me want to avert my eyes from the screen.  Or laugh.  Derisively.  But take them seriously as the future's upper crust?  Even in a movie?  Couldn't do it; not for a second.<br />And the action scenes... never have I seen such filmed more ineffectively.  And annoyingly.  All were filmed in such tight close-up that all one could make out was a dizziness-inducing blur of body parts in motion.<br />And I found the plot to be as disappointing as all of the above, as well.<br />So... to those who actually liked this film, I have to ask:  Why?<br />I'd also like to say to Stanley Tucci, Woody Harrelson,  Jennifer Lawrence and Donald Sutherland:  You should be ashamed of yourselves for appearing in such a turkey.  I guess, though, the paychecks were nice.  Because there couldn't possibly be another reason for being in a hooter like \\"The Hunger Games.\\"
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book invoked so many emotions out of me. I love it so much and it's just a sad, beautiful story that played out very nicely. This book had me tearing up so many times
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was very excited to start reading this book. Easy to read,exciting at times, happy and expected ending to boot!
B00AMBLXP8|5.0|Very funny, very witty. I recommend this movie for a good, mindless laugh. It's a bit raunchy and silly, but very funny.
B005GRTNVE|5.0|tHIS IS THE GREATEST ALBUM BY IL DIVO.  THEY ARE THE GREATEST.  EVERYTIME I HEAR THEM SING, I HOLD MY BREATH AND THINK JUST HOW WONDERFUL THEY ARE.  THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY MY FAVORITE GROUP AND INDIVIDUALLY.

B009MO5G90|4.0|I don't think most people would believe me if I said this is a good movie, but I have to admit that it was entertaining.  The story was worth only 3... mabe even just 2 stars, but I had to give it a star or two based off the 3D.  After watching tons of 3D movies, I have to say that everything looks good in 3D, but every now and then you come across a film that you can tell was made to be seen in that format.  Resident Evil really utilizes the 3D technology which made it that much more enjoyable.  If you're a fan of this series I think you will love this movie regardless, but for the rest of us the 3D may be needed to enjoy this for what it is.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Yes, I would recommend this item. It arrived as advertised, on time, safely packaged, and I had no issues at all.<br />I would def do business with this company again.<br />Excellent product !! -Jim  :-)
1594487154|5.0|You may not know it but you're in sales.<br /><br />If you acknowledge \\"sales\\" to mean \\"moving others\\"--persuading people, getting them to take action--then it should be obvious that we're all \\"in sales\\" to some degree. Parents, small business owners, public speakers, teachers, bosses, employees at any level--we're all trying to get someone to do something at some point. With this understanding, Dan Pink's new book can help you sell better.<br /><br />\\"To Sell Is Human\\" follows a similar approach as Dan's other bestsellers: combine original research with insights gained from social science and present it in an easy-to-read, informative package. Briefly, here's what I like about the book:<br /><br />1. Deconstructs some common myths about selling. Culturally, some tend to think of sales as a less-than-honorable way to make a living (pushy, dishonest backslappers: think stereotypical used car salesman or Willy Loman). We believe that you need to be an extravert to be good at sales, that good salespeople are born that way, and that only people who are employed as salespeople are \\"in sales.\\" None of these are true.<br /><br />2. Gives loads of helpful tools and techniques. Want some specific strategies to help you learn to move others? You'll find tons inside this book's pages, many of which may seem counterintuitive. For example, can you gain persuasive ability in a negotiation by assuming a position of lower status? Yes. And the chapter on pitching contains six models for framing a pitch (and, no, the \\"elevator pitch\\" is not among them). In fact, the book offers so many useful tools that the key challenge for readers will be to choose just a few to highlight and practice as they seek to improve the way they communicate.<br /><br />\\"To Sell Is Human\\" is a solid, helpful book that makes a great complement to Robert Cialdini's \\"[[ASIN:B002BD2UUC Influence]]\\" and Chip and Dan Heath's \\"[[ASIN:1400064287 Made to Stick: Why Some Ideas Survive and Others Die]].\\" If you haven't read those, please do. These three books together will help you grow in your ability to influence and persuade others and, far more importantly, make the world a better place.<br /><br />Note: I received an advance reading copy of the book from the publisher, but the opinions expressed in this review are my own and haven't been edited or approved by anyone.t read those, please do.

B00439MV42|4.0|This movie is basically about what happened to Emmet Brown \\"Doc\\" after the DeLorean got struck by lightning in 1955. Marty is stuck then he receives a letter a few minutes later. Marty reads the letter and figures out that Doc sented him that letter from seventy years ago. The letter says that Doc is out in the wild west in 1885. Doc states that he should go receive help from the other Doc from 1955. The letter also states that Marty should never return for him and go straight to 1985 but Marty soon discovers that Doc got shot a week after he wrote the letter. Marty soon realizes what he has to do.<br /><br />  I like the flow and the realistic feeling about this movie. I personally think this movie is very fun and entertaining but unlike movie one and two, there isn't really a point to this movie. I figured the point the creators of the movie were trying to make was that they had to save Doc before he got murdered but since there was the original Doc living in 1955, why did he have to go save the other Doc? Another thing I didn't really get was that from the very start of movie two, Doc said that they would need to destroy the time machine but at the end of movie three, Doc builds another one. I also thought this movie was about saving Doc but later in the movie you realize that this movie is all about Doc's Love life. I enjoyed renting this movie on demand. I watched it several times before the due date expired. I would say this movie was well worth the money and I would recommend it to almost anyone above ten years old. :-)
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I bought Hopeless by Colleen Hoover and The Coincidence of Callie and Kayden by Jessica Sorreson. Both books appeared somewhat similar and I was curious as to why they were so popular (they were alternating between the #1 and #2 spots on the best-sellers' list).<br /><br />The brief synopsis is that Hopeless is infinitely better than The Coincidence of Callie and Kayden, which I found to be completely unreadable. Hopeless is shelved in \\"contemporary romance\\" and \\"teens,\\" which is incredibly misleading considering the blurb includes a recommendation for adult readers due to sexual content, harsh language, and mature subject matter, including abuse. The blurb doesn't mention the fact that the main characters are high school students. I wasn't expecting explicit and extensive sexual conduct between teenagers. Maybe I'm ignorant of the technical definitions of the different categories, but I would say this book belongs in \\"erotica\\" and the characters need to be in their early 20s, or at least not living with their parents.<br /><br />The writing flows beautifully and is perfectly polished. I think I found one typo in the entire book. The book needs to be reformatted. Some paragraphs were in very large font, some were bold, and most were in the correct font. The formatting problem persisted throughout the book and it was annoying.<br /><br />The main characters are 17 and 18 years old. I felt like a creepy old woman reading about teenagers engaging in explicit sexual conduct. The fact that they're \\"technically legal\\" doesn't make it any less disturbing to read. They're in high school. The sex scenes are repetitive and overly-detailed. I skipped most of them because I just felt icky reading about two teenagers fondling each other. At 40%, I was wondering when the plot would start to develop and that's when I realized this book is a mis-labeled adult romance and the sex is the action. I have a compulsive need to finish every book I start, so I kept going. Then suddenly, out of nowhere, this awesome plot appears. The awesome plot, which I won't spoil, is completely incongruous with the concept the author establishes for the first half of the book. Sexy time with teenagers doesn't merge well with serious suspense and drama. I thought the romantic build-up and the sex stuff hindered the story and misled the audience, or at least it mislead me, and it came across as though the author merged two different book concepts and just didn't know what didn't belong in the new story. The detailed sex descriptions belonged in a different book.<br /><br />The author does one thing that I despise, which is an unfortunately common occurence in modern literature - she starts the book at a dramatic moment that is fairly far into the story and then rewinds to the beginning. I hate it when authors do this because I think it looks insecure, like they know the first half of the story is so boring the only way they'll get you to read the book is to tell you up front that something super dramatic happens later on. This turned out to be true. This book would've been much better if about 30% of the first half of the story had been deleted.<br /><br />In summation, the plot of the last half of the book is fantastic... if you can make it past alot of gratuitous sex between two barely legal characters who act like they're 30 more often than 18.<br /><br />-- Emma D, aka Anna Zimmerman
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Wonderful read...beautifully written, Nicholas Sparks captures the reality of an abusive relationship and shows that one can find their way back...
B005LAIHPE|5.0|good movie!  lots of action!  the movie arrrived on time and was undamaged.  it was everything that was promised and more.
B000UVT3OI|5.0|The quality was excellent and I found so many of the older Garth songs that I had completely forgotten about.  A great gift for any country music fan.
B005GRTNXC|5.0|I am a fan of Leona and I would recommend this CD to everyone.  Songs are beautiful and I must have played the CD five times already.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book!  I've loved all three of Colleen Hoover's books that have come out since she debuted last January.  She is definitely an automatic buy for me now and I'm anxiously awaiting the third book in the Slammed series some time this year.<br />I'm not going to summarize this gem of a story since others already have.  I also think this is a book that you just have to open up and read, and the story and characters will take over from there.  Colleen Hoover has such an amazing way with words and creates amazing characters.  Trust me, just read this...you will love it.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The best book of both the series with Percy Jackson and that Annabeth are in. Ricks books keep getting better! I love the way he ended this book and I can't wait for The House of Hades!
B004KPX5GC|5.0|Never managed to catch this one in the theatre, but finally got to watch at home.  Well written, great cast and performances, and a terrific story.  Even knowing what Secretariat achieved, you still get that sense of anticipation and excitement watching the races.
B005OCHOZS|5.0|I could not put the book down I read it in two days and am trying all of the great recipes.

B00AAX68HG|5.0|This game is so fun it will keep you busy it's great for a kid or adult I highly recommend!!!!
B00001W9G0|4.0|I remember seeing this in the theaters when it first came out.  I like both actors very much and this was a great combination. Wonderful but sad story. This is a movie that I will be giving to my mother.  She is a fan as well.
B005ARYEPK|4.0|Considering the time that this movie came out the innuendo between the main characters is easier to digest than I'm sure the newer version is. The theme of this movie is music and dancing NOT sex.  The last scene is great when they all get up and dance.
1250006341|5.0|I am a fan of Downton Abbey and was thrilled to get this book.  It breaks it down and writes a piece for each main character.  It's in hard bound form which gives it an added value to me. I will enjoy for years to come.
B00AQ3K8IU|1.0|This book was awful. Don't waste your money! Who wants to read about a love affair of 2 teenagers! The main characters were uncharacteristically mature. I was bothered by the fact I was reading about teenagers in an adult relationship!
1419705849|5.0|My Granddaughter loves this series and could not wait to get Book 7 to go with the other 6 books.<br />She will put down her Ninetindo in favor of reading a new Wimpy Kid book, which is just great.
B0064T6LV8|4.0|Really fun!  I like the sounds and displays.<br />Reminds me of &#34;the old days!&#34;  Works your hand eye coordination really well.
B007SSDI2E|5.0|Good values and well-acted movie. I enjoyed the performances of Meg Ryan and Hugh Jackman very much. Lots of fun.
B008EQIEWS|5.0|I am a big fan of this movie. I never got to see it in theaters, but when I saw this movie on amazon, I had to get it. When I bought my lg 3d tv and blue ray, I looked at it and i was amazed at what i saw. My favorite 3d scenes in the movie is when they were in the underworld, when Hades called Kronos and when Perseus is flying around Kronos and in his mouth with the spear of triam. I have many more scenes but those will do. I recommend that you buy this 3d movie, it is totally worth it.
B001EQ5ZJK|5.0|Wonderful book...must read for anyone wanting to take responsibility for their own health and understand the truth about our human bodies.
B008XBCJ34|4.0|Simple and classical history, the boy meets girl and they fall in love.<br />Well done 3D.<br />very good quality pictures.<br /><br />I liked the pictures of the flight of birds.<br /><br />UBUNTU
B003TSEEDY|3.0|Not at all what I had expected but over all great. Definitely worth reading more than once. Great writing and definitely worth the read
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Overall it was a good and entertaining movie and three other adults who saw it with me agree and liked it.  Bruce Willis' younger self, Joseph Gordon-Levitt, seemed to look artificial in the face.  It must have been the makeup to make him look more like his older self, Bruce Willis.  I don't want that to take away from the movie but I couldn't help but notice.  There was plenty of action and even a bit of romance.  The romance was a strong motivator for Willis' character and helps you understand his actions but the romance itself does not dominate the movie.  I liked having to pay attention to the transitions in future and past and figuring out the relationships of the characters.  The ending was very good and surprising.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Just started playing the game today!  So far it has to be my favorite downloaded to my Xoom tablet!  Bought the full game, love the hints and ability to search for items or play a game to skip the search.  Graphics are great.  Wish there were more games like this!
1400069289|4.0|I read this book because it was recommended by the CEO of Weight Watchers as explaining why some eating habits are hard to overcome. I never expected to find examples of how memory-damaged people can develop new habits or keep executing old habits long after they become disabled. It is an excellent read just for that reason.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I had not really heard about Downton Abbey until recently and decided to watch it from the beginning.  There are several story lines that switch deftly during each episode.  Never a dull moment.  The writing, acting, sets, everything is wonderful.  I would suggest watching Season 1 and continuing on.  Don't miss an episode.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|i &hearts; this game, works great on my fire. enjoyable game play puzzels on a scale of 1-10 r maybe a 6 sometimes 4 but its fun totally worth the money
B0049JPU8A|5.0|This is one of my favorite cds.  The script has great talent with their writing, musical and vocal abilities.  Great music to sing with loud in the car.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another victory for Michael Connelly.  No disappointment with this Harry Bosch adventure.  Certainly hope there will be a lot more to come as his daughter matures with police work her goal.
B0052REUW0|5.0|Pinker effectively argues that all manner of violence has been declining since the invention of<br />the state.  The argumentation is scholarly and persuasive, but whether what Pinker calls &#34;gentle commerce&#34; is an unambiguous force for good remains to be seen.  The commercial trashing for traditional cultures and increasingly skewed distributions of wealth in neoliberal economies may be laying foundations for violent right-wing extremism, but there is little place<br />for such prospects in Pinker's optimism.  Still, this is an extremely good read.
B009ZQC7MY|3.0|Downton abbey season 3<br />Not long enough was not clear enough on some of the items they show needs to be more precise
B007J4T2G8|4.0|A must read, I enjoyed every minute! I can't wait to start book two! It has renewed my own relationship, it's kinky and very relatable.
B0030IIYYS|5.0|While I don't think this one is as good as the first, this film was entertaining for the adults and the kids. It still manages to draw on favorite characters and the conundrums they are good at getting themselves into, without being boring or terribly predictable.  The addition of new characters was fun.  Though bringing the angle of an adult toy collector was a great cultural spoof and commentary on the collector mentality, the Toy Barn owner was creepy. He wasn't supposed to be likeable; still, I found him annoying more than anything.<br /><br />The kids really like this sequel, and it's a good, insightful family movie, without being terribly sentimental or insipid.  Good thing, as I'm sure we will be watching for years to come.
B00770KR7W|3.0|I have two Master Chief figures from McFarlane. One is the Halo 3 Anniversary Chief, and the other is this Chief. It may just be the new armor that MC is sporting in Halo 4, but the figure doesn't look nearly as sharp or &#34;Master Chief-esque&#34; as the previous figure design. There is just so much more detail to the in game character now that it might be hard for McFarlane to keep up with, resulting in a bland looking figure.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We watched the first season of Downton Abby on Netflix last week and were  hooked immediately.

I would recommend it to anyone.

B00AMBH70S|4.0|Good action - I enjoyed the super-spy power and elegance.  The ending left me a bit unfulfilled but worth a watch for $5.
B000UZ4CWW|5.0|Tbeir best album in years! Hardcore slayer at its finest. Slayer never disappoints and just kills with this release. Cult is my fav track.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved the historical research, although it's a work of fiction.The plot maintained interest throughout, even though the author had his readers back and forth across the Atlantic.The characters were realistic, with flaws and strengths.

B000V86OKG|5.0|Season 2 is nust as good as season one. takes off right where last season ended. Plot is that dexters burial.spot for his murders  is dis overed so the suspense is whether or not Miami PD will discover that dexter is the Bay Harbor Butcher.
B0086700CM|3.0|I like Temple Run, but it is a very difficult game to play. I would not recommend this game for kid.
B00005RG6B|5.0|Awesome live concert filmed at their all time peak! outstanding set list and master quality film production make this a must for the true Queensryche fan.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Just like with Slammed and Point of Retreat, Colleen Hoover sucked me in and I couldn't put this book down.  The characters and story line were beautifully written.  The connection between Sky and Holder was amazing.  It made me laugh and cry.  I will be reading every single book Colleen Hoover publishes :)

B008HK3XOU|3.0|I really like being able to open and close the case to make my Kindle hold it's place in what I'm viewing. I was disappointed in the quality of the case, but it will work for a starter case just fine. The red is a true bright red. I do like the plastic cradle the Kindle sits on. That's easier than the elastic holders other cases have.

B005KR6OBM|5.0|My wife an I are enjoying the Big Bang Theory every night. Just before going to bed we watch an episode of the Big Bang Theory and we go to sleep with a smile in our face.
B006BGZJJ4|4.0|I don't havee twenty more word to say.  I wish you  all Happy Ney Year comes to mind, but nothing else.
B0053O89WY|5.0|My wife and I watch one episode of The Big Bang Theory every night before going to bed. Comedy has become our way of relaxing from a hectic day and The Big Bang Theory really delivers a powerful dose of comedy. It is nice to enjoy a big laugh with the excellent performance of the whole crew of this exceptional program. I recommend it to everyone looking to enjoy life to the fullest, remember \\"laugh is the best medicine\\" and The Big Bang Theory makes you laugh to the max!
B007FEZQF8|5.0|I recently bought a Kindle Fire HD and was interested in filling it with books and comics to read in my spare time. I've been interested in comics and graphic novels, but didn't really know where to start. This series is an excellent beginning to any new comers collection.<br /><br />The story is fantastic and easy to follow. Characters are enjoyable and entertaining. Looking forward to purchasing the rest of the series and continuing the story.<br /><br />Encourage anyone interested in graphic novels to start here.
B000AGTPUU|5.0|My son adored this movie, I adored the price.  Very reasonable price and great quality.  I will continue to purchase from here in the future.
B00846REIS|3.0|Pretty good...too much like 50 shades...not unique in plot. Wish the characters could have been more varied than other romance stories.
B001HN6922|5.0|My son adored this movie, I adored the price.  Very reasonable price and great quality.  I will continue to purchase from here in the future.
B000KFB4PK|5.0|My four year old nephew loved it! It looks very cool and works very well. It can be ajusted to wrist size.
B00127RAJY|5.0|This is a GREAT workout video.  It will definitely kick your butt and you will see results if you stick with it.  I need to start it again!
0345528581|5.0|Believe every 5-star you read about this book. It is as good as everyone else says it is. This is the best health investment I have made in a long time, probably ever. The only reason I need to keep my gym membership is for the pool. Otherwise, I will be a lifelong user of what I have learned from this book!
0345803507|5.0|I love this book!  What can I say other than it was totally worth all the hype that it received!
B0098460O4|5.0|Not everything is lost with our kids!! This boy brings back hope! His voice is a present from God! So happy to be able to hear him from the begining until now and see tjat he still untouch!!a,a good for him!!
B004WDRT1Y|5.0|My son adored this movie, I adored the price.  Very reasonable price and great quality.  I will continue to purchase from here in the future.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Geat item, shipped fast. Great movie with plenty of action and which is what I was looking for and it arrived on time.
0345803485|5.0|I love this book!  What can I say other than it was totally worth all the hype that it received!
1582701709|5.0|I have been reading lots of books and I really enjoy Rhonda's books and I look forward to reading more in the future
0345803493|5.0|I love this book!  What can I say other than it was totally worth all the hype that it received!
B002ZG999U|5.0|I love this crazy movie with all the old-timers (like me).  Lots of action, story-line isn't going to win a Pulitzer prize, it basically just fits around the action of the movie.
B009HEJXFS|3.0|Loved hearing Josh Brolin speak with Tommy Lee Jones. However, this does not hold a candle to MIB I. Needed more humor. Some spent too much time making the bad guy bad and not enough time with puns, jokes and human touches.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|Mr. Grisham has once again out done himself.  This book kept me riveted!  There were twists & turns that I would say &#34;where did that come from?&#34;  I truly enjoyed Grisham' Pelican Brief and have enjoyed most of his other books but this one is outstanding!
B0084B5TK8|5.0|I loved the audio version of this book with the use of different readers reading the different characters in the book.  I loved the accents each reader has that makes the book that much better.  They are able to read with such feeling and anunciate the local dialect with such ease that i actually could understand it better listening that if I were to read it myself...struggling trying to understand what some of the characters in the book were saying.  I would recommend this book highly to the classic horror reader to sit back and enjoy while being read to.
B001JYEMOQ|3.0|Let me start by saying that I love this move. It's a fabulously creepy story, well crafted by the talented Mr. Minghella.<br /><br />What I did NOT love was the video stream, which regularly froze for several seconds at a time throughout the film. Not cool. I might be leaving this feedback in the wrong place, so excuse me if I am.<br /><br />So the film? Five stars. The delivery? One star. The average? Three stars.
B008RNGCAO|5.0|I found this first collection to be very interesting and loved the Bane story! Definitely better then movie adaptations and can't beat the action.
0571238343|4.0|This book provides a lot of process information. It really gives you a get overall view. You'll enjoy it if you're into it.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|I truly love this movie,  althrough my only CON is that Ms.Stewart is sooo slient...in most movies.  But,  I still loved this movie and very happy I bought it!
0823023494|5.0|This book has really helped me out with my drawing. It takes you through the whole process step by step.
B0093FNZT6|5.0|There are many books written by authors who were willing to believe in a separate reality from the outset. What makes this one so special is that Dr. Eben Alexander, as a Neurosurgeon who would readily dismiss claims of NDE experiences from his patients as nothing more than an anomalous functionality of the brain was put in a position where denial was not an option.<br /><br />A great book for sceptics to read and also for those seeking confirmation that there belief in something other than this time around is a reality.
144185097X|4.0|This book was really different. I enjoyed the different views. I think for younger readers this would be an fantastic choice.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Looks great, sounds amazing and the extras that come along with it are amazing!  Well worth buying!  There is 5 discs total, 3 movies and 2 discs full of extras as well as a digital copy for all the movies! Well done WB!
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|It is so much fun!! There are puzzles you have to figure out everywhere you turn!! What is so funny is that some of them are so simple that you can't figure it out!! The animation makes you laugh. I recommend this game for those problem solvers out there. And if you are wondering, yes it is well worth the money!!!
B007XIC1GI|4.0|This book was a reread for me as I purchased and read it the first time when it was initially released. The second time was even more enjoyable.<br /><br />I am a fan of Manson's, with my favorite song being wormboy.I do not however claim to agree with everything he says or does, and I do not wear black lipstick or anything his fans tend to get stereotyped as. With that in mind, I have to say this is one of the most well written and entertaining books I have ever read. Manson's ability to tell his life story is admirable. He creates rapport with the reader from the beginning and never uses his ego to relate his situations, but honest and humble language. His book allows you to focus on why rather than the extreme what. Loved it!!!!!
1451695195|5.0|My wife and I read this book just over the weekend and yesterday and must say what a comforting account of life after death.  Dr. Alexander's  book just further confirms what we both already believed.  The book is well organized and reading it brought joy and warmth to our belief in God.  A must read for all.<br /><br />Benny and Diane Robinson
B007L3BMGA|1.0|After reading true stories of what sex slaves actually encounter, this book (and those like it) insults the real victims of what is a horrific industry. It's sad that this book has glamorized a very sick idea of what makes relationships work. I hope my sons never think this is an ok way to treat a lady.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought Wool Omnibus after I saw it recommended by a Swedish sci-fi bookstore and I must say it might be the best book, all categories, that I read during 2012 and I read a lot. I could write pages after pages on how great this book is, but all that would do is waste time you could be spending on reading the book instead. This is an instant sci-fi classic.
B0049IHX2C|4.0|Good movie, good actors, followup to men in black 1, was alot better than most other followup movies I have seen.
B001DF68MA|4.0|I would have given it 5 stars but it's really really small.<br />My 3 year old's legs are a bit cramped but it's worth it because she gets to ride up front.<br />I purchased &#34;the other brand&#34; before, which was more expensive but it did not fit onto my adult tricycle.<br />Everywhere we go people comment on how cool our setup is.<br />Sadly she won't fit it in pretty soon.<br />But all in all great product.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|Okay, let's start with the basics: this book is long and engrossing. You will need to set aside a week to get through it because otherwise you will moan and pout every time you have to put it down. It has some parts in it where you will want to throw things at the author because he is spending too much time in one place...but then, our tedium is also Kvothe's tedium and you get through it together. This book's world makes me happy... it's so full and detailed, I feel like I have been there and now that the book is over I want to go back.<br /><br />This book has everything good fantasy should have and then some... but read the first book of the series first. It builds.
0312330529|5.0|Someone at work lent this to me years ago in hardcover (it's quite long), and I wanted to finish the last 300 pages on my trip, so I bought this copy to take along. Even if half of the story is true, it's amazing (it's written as a novel but it is based on his life). If you're ever spent time in India, Mumbai specifically you will especially find it fascinating.
B006GWO5NE|1.0|I read the reviews and assumed this USB cable also charged my Kindle Fire.  It doesn't.  The cable that came with my Kindle has stopped working after a year and was hoping this would be a replacement.  So now I have to return it and find something else.  Very disappointed.
B004VYYA2K|4.0|This box fits tons of dolls and their clothes, totally worth it if at the end of the day it helps to tidy up the toys!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|I gave this as a gift and was told it is excellent! if you like christmas music and Rod Stewart you will love this! The item arrived timely and the packaging intact.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Works as it should every time.  No complaints about this device and it is used ALOT.  Makes playing alot of fun!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a great game to waste some time! Fun and addictive. It's much better than the other coin dozer games available.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|My 6 year old son and 7 year old daughter loved it. They have seen it multiple times. I would highly recommended as it is fun and cute and importantly encourages empathy, compassion and believing in yourself.  Plus it may inspire the love of food and cooking in kids, so important in our soulless and rashed culture of eating on the run and take-out. Another big plus is lack of violence (except for a crazy old lady shooting a rifle at the poor rats, of course unsuccessfully) and lack of bad language, both so ubiquitous even in kids' movies nowadays.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Bane was difficult to understand and so it took a little work to follow the story.  I wish Batman had been a little more present in the movie.  But other than that, it was quite good.
B008YZXYY2|5.0|This was the best purchase ever.  I attempted to buy this at Best Buy, they were NO HELP at all.  So I went on line and found this within 10 minutes at a very reasonable price.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|Thanks for having this.  Somehow we missed it when it came out.  Christmas was a happy day for the wife!
0979019710|5.0|Just finished reading the book this morning!  What an inspiring and motivating book!  I am ready to be the best that I can be and live the life I dream of.  Thanks Hal for pointing me in the right direction!  I'm off to work on my Level 10 2013.  Recommend this book to everyone.
B0052U6JLC|5.0|This was what I expected, however, sizing just a little small.  But it is an awesome shoe!  Great color, great look.
B00ARAO0WM|4.0|Entertaining  start to finish.  Joseph Gorden Levitt is a natural actor.  Story more interesting than expected wth good action and appropriate humor
B008GJV4F2|2.0|I thought this movie was going to be high-quality because of all the hype it received but it was STUPID. To the point where I didn't even finish watching it.
B00A7CI82I|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. Action packed following the normal Bourne story line. It fills in a lot of gaps they left opened from the previous trilogy.
0230710107|5.0|I looked this series of books! I listen to audio books frequently and first happened on Ken Follet while checking out a downloadable book from the library.
B0043RSJ8G|4.0|This book has an extremely satisfying end. While getting there may get you frustrated, it is worth it! Another good one by Jodi.
B004O3YGMC|5.0|The app does well in letting me utilize my PC remotely.  It is fairly easy to learn and gives me control over the functions I use most often.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Thought it was a great book! Couldn't put it down! Looking forward to the third one!! Would recommend to my friends!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I never even read what was in store for me in book 2, but that didn't matter. It was just as good as the first book with an ending that leaves the reader expecting some new twists in book 3.
B00AHSINKO|5.0|Um, because I loved it.  From the critical ratings, I expected mediocrity (but with good people).  Instead, Hope Springs was exactly what its title promises and for anyone who has ever been in an imperfect relationship (the only kind I know about), it is simply delightful: producing smiles and twinges of recognition and, dare I say it, a warmed heart.  :-)  Tommy Lee Jones and Meryl Streep inhabit their roles perfectly.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|It was great to watch the first season again.  This show keeps you on the edge of your seat and has a great storyline.
B008N1V11U|5.0|this game is awesome.u can ride his bike and other vehicles.this game is worth the $0.99.this is. an awesome game
B00AMBK6J2|4.0|Came in half-hearted but wanted some comic relief. Delievered and more. Was very funny and just serious enough to close the plot.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Gruesome but gentle. Didn't think I would like this sort of storyline...I was right...I love it! Can't wait for the next book!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome because it allows you to express your creativity and no other game can do that.plus the game for pc is $25 so compared to this its expensive.
B007W1BLN0|3.0|pretty good movie i heard about the story when i was in alaska this summer and wanted to check it out.acting is pretty good story is really intresting.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|it is a very intrigging game and time passes way to quick when i play I love it and so does my husband
B009HEMW4W|5.0|I like this movie when I saw it in the movie so I bought me one and one for a Christmas present. Great Movie!
B00A80SHFM|5.0|This soundtrack is awesome!  The Les Miserables CD allows you to hear each and every nuance of the beautiful instrumentation plus being one of the first to hear the actors and actresses singing &#34;LIVE&#34; throughout the movie versus canned sound or a studio dubbing of music.  Once you visually see the movie; then, each and every time you listen to the CD ~ it takes you back to that place where it all became one ... highly recommend!!
B000W9DSVW|3.0|The movie's are entertaining, but the movie is DVD quality, not HD. Be carefull alot of Blu-rays, say they are HD but they are not.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|i loved this game, its hard to find decent ones that catch my interest. the plot was good and loved all the different scenes and how one object would unlock another. absolutely amazing i give this a five star rating.
B00A8ECU24|3.0|Games fun however I would rather just buy the game and get the gems in it rather than them wanting me to buy them. Gems and coins are very expensive. It's a game that's it fun for a week or so than Can't really go much further.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|This book was fascinating to read!  I have always been very curious about NDEs but reading the incredible experiences of a medical doctor who was previously unable to scientifically substantiate them pretty much convinced me that there is a God and an afterlife much better than this human state in which we live.  I have always had faith that it was true but at times have questioned whether a person's soul exists after death.  I'm totally convinced now and am happy to know that a better place is waiting for me beyond this earthly one.  At times I could not put the book down because it was so intense.  I highly recommend it.
B00008RWBF|5.0|Forgot to review this book.  I've enjoyed the recipies, especially they use old-style, true Italian cooking.  The recipe for spaghetti sauce is very good!
B006WM2FFS|5.0|Well, Jet Li, what else can you say.  Epic tale of Chinese history, beautiful cinematography, excellent martial arts, and epic scale.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Really entertaining, the first few levels are really good for small Kids, but as you continue it engages your brain and really makes the time fly
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|This is a challenge and very interesting. but it was over before I got to the end.  Took me by surprise that there was nothing more without buying the game.  It was a lot of funnwhile it lasted. I would have given it 5 if I could have played free to the end.
B00000G3PA|5.0|I love the movie and the cast. I had to have it for my collection. It arrived quickly and in great condition.
B0034G4OUO|5.0|I love the movies that Johnson is in an this is no different Great movie would recommend it to anyone that likes good movies
6304806434|5.0|I love the movie and the cast. I had to have it for my collection. It arrived quickly and in great condition.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game is simple enough to keep kids busy and intriguing enough to keep most adults busy. You really can't argue with free either.
B000683VI4|5.0|I love the movie and the cast. I had to have it for my collection. It arrived quickly and in great condition.
B0090YHSFC|5.0|Fairly simple fun.  The rules on how things work are straightforward. Some of the levels are quite difficult even with the power-ups.
B000FC13E0|5.0|Highly recommended and a very quick and interesting read. Typical Crichton thriller. Can't put it down. Definitely five stars. A good overview of emerging technologies.
B0091REZMW|5.0|good game love the look and style.  if you like games that have you search this game is for you
B000VYX8PE|3.0|I was looking for a smart sarcastic tone to a macabre background in this story, and I should have gone in with less assumption.  The end is anticlimatic, and in today's age of &#34;nothing in the news but misery&#34; it wasn't the book I probably should have picked for my plane ride home for the holidays.  I was expecting something craftier and ended the book feeling &#34;ho-hum&#34;.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I decided to take a look at this book after first hearing about the movie - which I wanted to see in theatres. Not long after starting the \\"sample\\" for Kindle, I was hooked by the narrator's innocence and insightful observation of those around him. Although it seemed to be written for a \\"teenage\\" audience (I am in my 20s) I bought the book & was not disappointed - it is endearing, heartfelt and at times heartwrenching, but very relevant to all ages. I found the \\"age\\" of the narrator, Charlie, only added to the meaning and I highly recommend this book.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I think the foreword by Card made it even more helpful to approach his style of writing.  Talking to others who have already read his books, Card describes his approach well, and it was god preparation for what I was about to read and allowed me to relate to the author as I flipped the pages.  I could not put this book down, and could resonate with the theme of feeling like the misunderstood youngster who can't seem to find a niche in life without feeling isolated from all the other niches.  Can't wait to get to the next book!
B004SBULWE|5.0|Installed this app on my Smarty phone (?) to take care of those testy task that don't want to go home when the party is over. It get's the job done.
B005GSZZ1A|5.0|This book paints a portrait of what North Korea is like in modern times. The journey NK refugees face is indeed arduous, and the book details that account beautifully. A must read for any political scientist or humanitarian.
B002BC9YY8|5.0|Angel-A is a wonderful movie it is all black and white but it is a great story and also wonderful scences
B008MG1E4A|3.0|this was an easy read, nothing crazy or amazing details that already weren't leaked.  Just a detailed retelling of an operation executed by highly trained professionals.
B007SGM084|5.0|Purchased this trilogy for my Kindle and really enjoyed reading them. The first of the series is a little rough, more for shock value I think. The second and third book in the series get better, much more of the love story and suspense involved. Appreciated having the format for the Kindle.
B0002EXH5E|4.0|1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I love reading as much as writing. As the author of [[ASIN:B00AVQALB6 Solitary - Young Adult Paranormal Romance (Labyrinth Series)]]I understand the immense undertaking of sitting down and hammering out a novel. Sometimes I like to read intense, thought provoking material and sometimes I just like to glide through an effortless story...this is one of those times.<br />Fifty Shades of Grey is not literature and it's not meant to be. It's a fantasy, period. For those of you looking for hardcore S&M, look elsewhere. This book only dabbles with the idea of the \\"Red Room of Pain,\\" but never develops it. The love story is contrived, but so are most fairy tales. Untouchable Prince Charming finds an unlikely woman irresistible and whisks her away to his palace in the sky.<br />There were plenty of times that I wondered how this book made it to be a best seller. But then, there I was, continuing to read it. I let go of any expectation and just allowed the story (however unlikely) to unfold, without me trying to force reality in between the sheets.<br />For a rainy day, it's a lovers tale, where love actually overcomes infatuation.<br />Enjoy.
B0084IG8TM|5.0|I absolutely love this movie! They didn't screw it up like some book to movies are, and it's a great buy!
B00005Y228|5.0|This is a sexy upbeat album. It would be great to listen to during a workout or just driving etc.
B009JBZH54|5.0|What can you say about this, except great movies, great acting and directing, CHRISTIAN BALE IN HD :-), :-), :-)!!!!
B005HS00NW|5.0|Great upbeat album for the alternative crowd. Loved the music and it's positive vibe. It would be great to listen to this at the beach.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I am thankful God led me to this app. I like the daily reading plans and how there is a calendar to help stay on track. I also like the fact I can download versions of the Bible to read when internet access is limited.
B0037W68F4|5.0|Fun, upbeat album for the alternative crowd. Listen to it for good vibes and positive energy. It is a great substitute for all the sad negative music out there.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Slowly progressing book, starts suddenly with odd activities within ruling people and it's kind of a hard to grasp where when and why these things happen and is someone or something guiding things behind scenes.  Hero raises from odd place to quickly be destroyed by ruling p...
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE!!!!!!!!! Absolutely amazing from start to finish. Could not put it down. Recommend it to everyone! So worth it to read.
B008EZVNO0|5.0|Very good cd .I would have to say that this is his best cd in years .This is indeed vintage sounding .John Postiglione
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I rate this book a four rating.  The plot was unique and kept the readers attention.  Can't wait to read the sequel.
B009VLX8FS|5.0|Have liked several of Taylor Swift's songs over the past few years, but this album blew me away.  A friend of mine recommended it to me after purchasing it here, and I followed suit soon after.  Definitely a favorite!
067144901X|5.0|I read it every day to my grandniece on SKYPE! She lives in Canada so it is our special connection.
0385535147|1.0|I waited a very long time to read another book by Grisham and I have to say, I wish I'd waited longer.  It was too simple.  It was too predictable.  It had no life and was simply a waste of time.  This aint no funny anymore.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|Simpler than I thought and a lot of intertwined current issues for a high schooler but love the messages and meanings.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Best show out right now!! My husband and family are all hooked on this show!!! Hope it keeps going! Pricing is not too bad for each episode.
0451232852|4.0|Very enjoyable book, especially for a reader who takes interest in world history. Follet does an excellent job weaving fictional characters around actual people and events. Looking forward to the second book in this trilogy!
B0095R76EW|1.0|Flat out this movie was terrible! I couldn't even make it half way thru the movie! It just drug on in parts that it really shouldn't have.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The author needs to write more on this . Like maybe add more and keep it going this book definitely needs to keep going it ended as a valid hanger
B008HT4FUW|1.0|This was purchased as a Christmas gift for a family member and I was upset to see them watching it. The quality of the blu ray dvds are absolute garbage. The picture is horribly grainy and the playback is jumpy. It is very noticeable. We turned to the hd episodes playing on tv and they are crystal clear and perfect. I don't see how a boy ray disc set could be so bad. I own several other blu rays and have never seen ones look like this. I honestly think it's a bootleg ...will be contacting amazon for further investigation
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I played it all in one evening. I enjoyed it enough but not sure if it was worth 2.99. I gave it 4 stars....
B0094BB4TW|1.0|Constantly taking off on its own search.  Have an incorrect email adress for an old account I can't get in to. Been hacked twice.<br />Too much drama for younger teens.  Dangerous way for people to track others.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Once you start you want to know every thing about Katie. You will not be disappointed! Starts great and ends greater
B007TNS6JI|4.0|amazing gameplay, graphics, items, but every game has its its ups and downs. idk how to do online multiplayer, and i havent found any magic, rare, etc. items, but the ps3 version does. but aside all that, its an amazing game.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|Well, it's The Floyd and it's fantastic!  I can play it on my computer or our T.V. with sound around.  I love it & it was bought at great price!  So wonderful to be able purchase it and enjoy whenever I choose.  I'm looking forward to saving my money for another music adventure soon.<br /><br />Thank You.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is funny and educational this book is my favorite I 're omens this book to the 10 year olds
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|It is challenging and sometimes there are just not enough birds to get the job done.  But is it fun
B003ODIZL6|1.0|Sucks boo fire dumb scrappy.sit down and watch the movie band and watch them to the movie band and a kindle fire dumb enough yay

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Jeff Kinney has done it again I love his stories him and James Patterson are my favorite authors can't wait for the next one.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Great book, it will make you look at a distant mountain in a completely different light. By the time I was finished I had to control my emotions to keep myself from trying an ultra on my own!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I think this game is a exciting game that can also spook you a little it is one of the best of all these types of games
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This was the very best book ever and you never want to stop reading it never ever ever ever want to.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|That's all I have to say about this book. It made me respect the life of people who have to go through this. It made picture every moment they had in my head so clearly like it had just happened to me yesterday. It made me cry, and I don't usually cry over books. It made me wish no one had to- or has to- go through any of this. It made me fall in love with all of the characters with every word I read. It made me speechless.
B008476HBM|5.0|I have started reading the list of 100 books to read before you die and this is my favorite so far. A beautiful story well written.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|This was a really well crafted ending to the hunger games series. My only complaints are that it's very sad and has a little too much gore and killing. Also, it, in my opinion, did not have the best ending. 80 percent through it kind of got worse, but the book still ended up being good.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is one of the best books I've ever read and if you are going to take advise about a kids book....take it from a kid i am 11 years old and i love this series!!
B006LSZECO|4.0|I am a mom of two young kids so I rarely find time to finish a book let alone read at all.  This story was so thoroughly engaging I found myself reading it every chance I got despite my kids crawling all over my face. I was not fond of the ending but hey, it worked!
0061969664|5.0|Death of Kings covers the events surrounding the death of Alfred the Great of Wessex in 899. His son Edward is heir to the throne, much to the chagrin of Alfred's nephew Æthelwold. Uhtred, the protagonist of The Saxon Tales and the warrior who defeated many a Dane in defense of Alfred's kingdom, is in his forties by this novel. He is still the lover of Æthelflaed, Alfred's daughter, and remains the greatest Saxon warrior in England. But his own life and the fate of the kingdom become threatened by Alfred's impending demise as a cast of Danes, and even some treacherous Saxon lords, scheme to take Wessex for their own. And killing Uhtred of Bebbanburg is at top of the list towards achieving that goal.<br /><br />As with most of the novels in The Saxon Tales series, the foundation for this plot was laid with events and characters from earlier books. Familiar villains, like Haesten the Dane, are back, as are allies including Father Willibald, Father Beocca, Steapa, and Finan. And like many of Cornwell's novels, this one builds towards a climactic battle with the Danes over the fate of Wessex. Cornwell writes medieval battle scenes better than any author I have read, and the several in this novel are the highlights of the story. There is also a bit of a puzzle in the plot, because this time none of the Danes' actions make sense to Uhtred until he unravels a mystery at the end. I truly enjoyed this novel and highly recommend it!
0446554995|3.0|I always look forward to a new book by these authors, and this was no exception.  However, I was disappointed.  The character growth was insignificant, and explanations non existent.  And where is the Esterhazy twin brother?  Another book?  Links between Nazi group and the Island from the first of the series was never explained in my mind.  And they continue to have very weak female characters.  Please put more time into a semi-plausible plot.
0425252868|5.0|I first became familiar with this story several years ago through a magazine published by Valor Studios.  It touched my heart then, but it was not until I read the entire book that I felt I really knew this complete amazing story.  I was really overcome by all that had transpired between these two pilots during World War II, how they had connected again in later years, and the beautiful friendship that followed.  This book is also a tribute to the two authors who wrote such a moving story and I would like to thank them for bringing it to us.<br /><br />Carol Lordo
1594487154|5.0|First, some disclosure: I received an advanced copy of \\"To Sell is Human,\\" and I interviewed Daniel Pink on my podcast \\"Social Triggers Insider.\\" That said, there are three main reasons why this book is a must-read:<br /><br />1. Even though the official statistic is \\"1 in 9 people\\" are in sales, the truth is, everyone is in sales. 1 in 9 people earn a commission for it, the other 8 live and die by their ability to sell... and they don't even realize it. Whether they're negotiating a raise from their boss, convincing their child to do homework, or turning a prospect into a client, their success depends on their ability to sell someone on something--and Dan Pink shows those people how to do it.<br /><br />2. There are some huckster salesman that give honest people like a bad rep. What's weird is, I thought these hucksters were just bad people, but I've come to discover otherwise. It turns out there are sales trainers who teach their students to lie to get the sale, but this book will shows the liars that there's a better way.<br /><br />3. Many mainstream books like this are \\"high level.\\" They tell a great story, share interesting research, and give you ideas on how oyu may apply this to your life. Dan Pink's book is different. Between the \\"frames\\" for selling, and the 6 new types of pitches (they replace the elevator pitch), you get a complete tool-belt of strategies and tactics that you can begin using TODAY. Additionally, he's got these great \\"Sample Cases\\" mixed throughout his book where he shows you exactly how to use some of the tactics and strategies he shares.<br /><br />That all said, I'm happy to have read this book, not once, but twice. I also admire the fact that he paid special attention to all of his sourcing because I'm the type of guy who reads all the source material..
B005HJWWW8|1.0|There appears to be quality issues with the Fiio E6. My unit worked for the first listening session and stopped working after that. It will no longer charge or turn on. I may have received one of the counterfeit units that have been mentioned by other reviewers and in on-line forums regarding the E6. I hope that Amazon will work with their suppliers and partners to resolve these issues.
B00AAX68HG|5.0|you do have to think a bit, but that is not a bad thing. My 7 year old loves it.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I ALWAYS look forward to another Harry Bosch novel.  This story does not disappoint!  I loved the twists and turns to the story and it always kept me guessing.  Thanks For another great Harry Bosch story!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|As always, Preston and Child give the narrative a wonderful twist, a turn pager. Pendergast is amazing, I cannot wait to see the series.<br />Highly recommend this book
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This app has everything I need, especially the shortcuts on the bottom of the screen.This has intuitive designs and look great!

0763644765|5.0|I bought this book based on very good reviews and I totally agree with them - the book is well made with a fun way to discover a potty.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I absolutely loved the whole trilogy, but I loved the ending to it all. Also, I can't wait for the book written from Christian's point of view :)
B0073TBYTC|5.0|Another outstanding and thrilling book by this author.  If you enjoyed the first novel, you will love this one.  It grabs you from the first page!  Highly recommend it!
B008ELUEQC|5.0|Bought this for my wife for Christmas. She loved it! Classic Christmas music with Rod Stewart's classic styling is a great combination.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Was unable to read it cause i could not down load it at all. Tried three times and still had trouble.
078322799X|5.0|Good movie, knew it was before I bought it.  Michael J Fox is funny in this scary/funny movie.  You can't help but love it
1419705849|5.0|Conveys, in a great, sharp mannered way, the painful cruelties and unpredictability of early adolescence, whiles praising awkwardness without feeling the need to make it too cheesy. I was in awe of this book, very fun read.
0446567337|5.0|Nicholas Sparks won't let you down with this one.  Great book.  I like to read the book before the movie comes out and wasn't disappointed with this.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This book will keep u waiting on the next word.  It is well written to keep you hanging on through all the twist and turns
B00AMBK0X4|2.0|My son recommended this movie and I know why, it's geared for the younger generation.  I found it to be more a parochial movie that would be appreciated by people, mostly of the male gender, in their teens and twenties.  Although I did find some of the gags funny, I got bored with it after thirty minutes.  I wasn't impressed and was disappointed with Mark Wahlbergs's performance, and I love his other work.
B005QUQ99K|5.0|My son loved it. He put it together almost all by himself too and he's only 6 years old. Great way to bond too!
B000W91RUG|5.0|This was purchased as a gift and according to receipent is very good and price was excellent compared to what the stores charge.
B009ZXT4BY|1.0|It was not fun to play at all, it has a horrible time, and very hard to control.<br />over all,  it stinks!
B00006V9A0|5.0|What can I say...it's Nirvana. Doesn't get better than that. Top product, Wish they were still about, Kurt Cobain rocks on...even in death
B0086700CM|5.0|I cant stop playing this game. I have too much fun playing this game. I think its the best game.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This easy, somewhat shorter book, was a quick read. Cute, typical romance novel. Characters were likable, and it was free on the kindle! Can't beat that.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is a must read book full of adventure and mystery. I can't wait for the next installment of this series.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|i am addicted to this game. i love when you go so fast and SMACK hit a train....its funny<br />and challenging.  i highly recommend this awesome free ap.  i play on my kindle fire hd
B002MQYOFW|4.0|While I hadn't had high hopes for the book to begin with a friend's recommendation that the book was superior to the grossly overrated, slow paced film adaption brought me to read it.  While I agree that the book is superior in quality I still did not like it, mostly because the writings terse voice and matter of fact narration
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This game has beautiful graphics and is quite engaging. I didn't realize an hour had passed! I would recommend this game to anyone. I am giving myself five more minutes..then I Have To get ready for work. Cheers!
159514188X|1.0|please save your money and do not buy the book. I read this book about a year ago and basically forced myself throughout the whole novel. This novel is basically about a girl named Hannah Baker who records a series of tapes explaining/blaming how thirteen different people for her death.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|there is nothing bad i can say about this app. it does everthing i need and is handy and easy to use. plus free! how can u go wrong?
B008EQIEWS|5.0|Other than some of the fast dialogue and mainly colorless/gloomy scenes, the whole story was good. If you're a Sci Fi or mythical age fan, then you'll dig this one.
B0058VW36U|4.0|This game is very fun but my 3 year old can beat me 50 years older but I still try to win
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Liked 1 and 2, and 3 was just as good! Rare, I know. But it kept us all interested all the way through. Same fun, cool images, great characters, and neat new characters. Cant wait till #4!
B009MCRHH6|4.0|This game was different, addictive, and challenging.  Overall very fun to play.  Bought this when it was the free app of the day promo.
B004Z2TUGE|5.0|I like Sci-Fi flicks...sometimes they can be hokey, but, this one looked decent, so, rented it. Wow- loved it! It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The best part about it is that the whole Sci-Fi aspect in it was so realistically done, that it puts the viewer in thought that this could possibly be real. Will watch it again, and again. Hoping for a sequel! A+!!
B0000C8AQM|4.0|This was for my husband for a Chrismas present.  He loves the movie and the music and now loves the soundtrack.
B009MF5BXK|5.0|If you like action there is plenty of it here also some wit and humor<br />from a  cast of who's who in the action genre.
B00ADYYBFI|4.0|I enjoyed the cd but like others I was very disappointed Fade Into You wasn't on it.  That's the best song of them all.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I saw this on TV and we really enjoyed it.  I think they did a great job making it and it seems to stick to the book.
B0094MAZKK|5.0|If you don't mind the subtitles and enjoy martial arts. Then you should enjoy this movie. Also look for the main character soon in Keanu Reeves movie Man of Tai Chi.
B00AHSGNJM|5.0|My 2-1/2 year old son loves it.  We purchased it in advance of a disney trip and hope he watches it on the plane.
B00A9X9ORI|4.0|Good movie. I liked it the twist in it. My girl fell asleep though. Said it was a little confusing.
0439023521|5.0|The book is way better than the movie. It would have overrun the budget of their movie if they had included all of the details of this book.
0345444051|4.0|It was an interesting experience to read something written in 1953. I could easily see the 60 years, huge mentality gap. The book is very outdated of course, and in several occasions I was pretty close to abandon the read. At some points it can be very irrational, and pessimist. I don't think I will read something this old again. However, I don't feel it was a waste of my time. I could see how wrong the writer's perspective was about mankind, and that made me feel some pride.
1416583432|2.0|....but I couldn't tolerate her writing style. She's very wordy, which unfortunately made reading it very boring. I rarely write bad reviews about anything, but I was so disappointed, I had to share my experience. I'm a dog owner and lover, so my interest was peaked simply reading the introduction. However, it was all downhill from there on.<br />There wasn't too much information in the book that a dog owner wouldn't already know simply by spending time with their dog. There were some interesting facts that grabbed my attention, but they were few and far between.<br />Like I said, I wanted so badly to like the book and come away with some novel information, however, I was so bored, I could barely get through it.
1439181780|5.0|gave this to  two on my christmas list.....they havent gotten back to me with the good inspirational news, but sure they will....my copy is well read and highlighted much......thanks
B009JBZH54|5.0|These 3 are easily the best of ALL the batman movies. Epic acting and story telling throughout all the Dark Knight trilogy movies.
1451673442|5.0|ORDERED MUCH OF THE BOOKS FOR GIFTS.....HAVE A COPY....ENJOYING AND INSPIRATIONAL .  A FEEL GOOD GIFT TO OTHERS....THANKS VERY MUCH
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was such a great book. Very sexy. I thought I would just read the first of the series, but I'm addicted and now almost finished with Fifty Shades Darker. So glad I gave this a try.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Colleen Hoover is a genius! She manages to create another piece of literary art that will leave the reader feeling connected to the characters. 3 for 3!
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I am loving this series! I cannot wait for the next book to hurry and come out! I HIGHLY recommend!
B008E6I1K8|5.0|This book is a comprehensive coverage of C#. One of the best things about the book is that it takes you from the basic concepts to the advanced concepts. I highly recommend it.
B005H0IW6W|5.0|Michael Bubl&eacute;'s voice is extremely well suited for this genre! He evokes the memories of classic singers such as Dean Martin and Andy Williams, yet he still infuses these timeless classics with his own style and finesse. Well done!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good ending but still would like more....almost leaves you with a sad feeling,but deep down you know that it has to end and its not a fairy tale
B000VDDDVO|5.0|I watched the color version and it is very good. Both the black and white and color versions are provided. The sound on the color version is also excellent. I would give the color restoration an 'A' rating. Based on the color version, I would assume that the black and white version in its format would also be of good quality. The color version provides extra resolution on details that I had not noticed on watching the black white version several years ago. Highly recommended.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Got one for my kids kindle fire HD gen 2.<br />They love playing the game and playing through a network. The best part is that I can join them from my iphone so it being cross device compatible is awesome.<br /><br />With each update they keep adding features. Great world building that at first seems so easy but requires all those great gaming skills. And it gives my kid that crafting and curiosity they need to build wonderful things.<br /><br />I'd also like to comment on the 1 stars that seem to be appearing. It is very disappointing to see that most of the 1 stars have nothing to do with reviewing the game. More instead the downloading issues. If you are having issues downloading the game, file a ticket with Amazon, do not give one star. This seems very unfair as your rating has nothing to do with the product but the service platform it is on.<br /><br />Also to address other folks who wish to compare the PC version and pocket version and give it 1 star. This is also very wrong. There are some pretty big limitations when programming a pocket game to PC when it comes to this (documented on their site). They have to go slow and build correct. Version 1 of the Pocket edition was very simple. It was actually never meant to have a crafting component. They have steadily been building this in and have done a great job with what they have. The current PC version is not 1.0.<br /><br />Looking forward to great updates.
B002ZG9774|5.0|i love anything cher is in. i like the dances. and the music.if your a cher fan u won't be dissapointed.
1451695187|5.0|Very interesting.  Good, reliable information, &#34;proof&#34; of events described in book.<br />A little difficult to understand when the science information dominates, but still can be deciphered..
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Is everything I heard it to be!!  Can't wait to start the other two follow ups...<br />So glad I got a Kindle for Christmas, haven't read a book in over 10 yrs.
B00AB0AR2U|1.0|I wasn't expecting much when watching this movie, and I was right not to expect much.  The movie goes from awful to just barely watchable.  It is not good.  It is disappointing because the first Resident Evil was soo good.  These movies just never end or resolve anything and you know there will be another awful one, and I also know for some reason I will watch it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I absolutely loved this book.. I was always wondering what was going on and what the truth was and it even had me in tears at some point.. this book is by far one that keeps you reading.. by far my favorite book!!!
B002HFJ77S|5.0|Although I sometimes found it long and overly narrate, it was still very funny, and the characters endearing. I recommend it.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I'm really impressed with the look and feel of this watch. It was made with exceptional quality. I've always been partial to Seiko though. I just like their clean lines and classic styling. My only complaint is that the adjustment knob is very difficult to nearly impossible to adjust while it is on your wrist; not a huge deal to take it off your wrist and adjust, but a minor design flaw. So far it seems to keep time for about 24 hours off your wrist. I've had no trouble with having to reset it every morning after taking it off when I go to bed at night, but longer than 12 hours of no movement and it will probably start to lose time. Some people are real obsessed with time accuracy but a watch like this isn't going to be used to send people to the moon. If I need more accuracy I'll use something that's updated regularly by the national clock system. Plus or minus 1 minute should be close enough to get you to your meetings on time; if not, it may be time to reevaluate some things!
B002RI9UBS|5.0|I like various kinds of books, and Life Of Pi was quite hooking. Tiger and a boy in a boat on vast open sea, that's something else.
B00280LYIM|5.0|Loads of excitement, and keeps you reading the series. Love the almost seamless blend of ancient mythology and modern tech.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|I purchased this CD for a Birthday gift after hearing most songs on the radio.  This was a great CD for gifts.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|Fairly good this is not required.  I don't  do this . Eighteen words are unnecessary. I hope you are happy.
B001U7WUW8|2.0|Now don't get me wrong: I love Green Day Dookie. The problem with this shipment is that in the product detail they say it's the 180 Gram Vinyl LP. I do not know if they shipped me a wrong copy, but the copy I received was not 180G. I am still dealing with the process to get a 180 Gram copy. Shipping was super fast and the product came in great condition. I just don't appreciate receiving the product and not getting it as described. MAKE SURE TO VERIFY YOU GET 180G Vinyl from this seller if it's in the product description you order!
B006TJXZ30|5.0|Nice and easy to use. I recommend this app. You can send mail, read and delete, mark as read/unread. Basic email is all  I need.
B007SGM084|1.0|He is an abusive, sadistic, controlling man who wants her to behave like a 'good girl'!  Give me a break.  And she very politely takes it becuase 'she loves him'.  It is absolutely ridiculous and men like that are everywhere, the real ones just do not have a job.  I cannot reiterate it enough.  I HATE THIS BOOK!
B000AP04OM|5.0|I have loved this movie since I first saw it as a child. It is a feel-good movie and the music is timelessly beautiful. This CD reproduction has an excellent picture and very good sound. A GREAT family movie..
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Not sure why I like this movie, but I do. It’s not the fastest paced movie, but it does have a fair amount of interesting characters and has a science based story line. Kind of like a Stargate episode without the guns or the 90’s version of 2001 Space Odyssey. Enjoy!
B009LA1QW6|5.0|I really like her voice. She has an ethereal quality with a sort of country sound. Very unique. I usually don't buy CDs but I heard this one playing in someone's car at the gas station, loved her sound, asked the driver who was playing, and then bought it myself. No regrets.
B005NFJAMG|3.0|I watched it knowing they removed some scenes but you really cannot tell at all. The movie seemed to flow just fine without those scenes. I have the DVD with the original movie version. It’s one of my favorite movies. I just wanted it in Blu-Ray so no complaints here; well one complaint I wish there were some special features. So removed one star for cutting the scenes and another star for no special features.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I loved this movie soo much. The songs were great, probably even better than the original artists themselves. I am going to buy this movie and watch it all the time. I gave it 5 stars because I loved every part of it, and it was hilarious and almost made me pee myself, it was so funny. I love the voices and the story and the cute guys and this movie is just amazing. It was 'pitch perfect!'
B004IFYN2E|5.0|It’s definitely a chick’s flix but I enjoyed it nonetheless. Really well done the story line was tight and location was just beautiful plus I like movies with a twist at the end! It also has a bunch of special features which I like. So two thumbs up! It’s a good movie.
B009JNXK88|3.0|A side scroller.  What do you expect?  It was fun for awhile - got bored with it.  I like something that uses the smartphone/tablet interface to aid in controls.  This uses the lazy &#34;mimic an arcade controller&#34; with onscreen D pad and what not.  Get some creativity with controls as well as the game!
034580404X|5.0|this was a requested gift.  she has started reading these books already so i will be able to read them on vacation.
B008458O3S|5.0|Haven't seen anything like this.  A great time colliding, bypassing, and organizing trains into and out of train depots.  Just when you've about gotten the knack of it, they add a variance and step it up!  A ton of fun that I keep returning to.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I read this book in a day because I just couldn't put it down.  It is very intense, and quite the emotional roller coaster.  Another great read by Colleen Hoover!
0345528581|4.0|I started this workout after a few years of no exercise.  I had previously been a daily gym member running 6-7 miles a day and lifting weights.  These simple workouts nailed me big time.  The &#34;ladder&#34; system of escalating reps is a great way to work into exercising.  After the first day's upper body workout I was sore for a week.  After the lower body workout the next week I nearly couldn't walk.  It is very challenging.<br /><br />I would agree with other reviewers that much of the book is substituting furniture for workout equipment.  I find it hard to use a chair for a pull up as none of mine are quite high enough, and my table isn't good for holding weight on the edges like he requests, it is a center support!  Overall, it is a good challenging workout if you can find the appropriate furniture that can hold up your weight.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I had a hard time putting this book down from start to finish. Enough twists to keep you guessing but not overdone.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|very fun to play and works great on the Kindle Fire HD 8.9 worth the $.99 i will let every
B004TI5N38|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot it reminded me of why I enjoy Grisham so much. The way he establishes characters and their relationships makes them very relevant and easy to relate to.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Every time I wanted into my local bookstore, I saw this book & kept telling myself that I should get it. I've  heard tons of good reviews on it & that it wasn't just a cancer book, but more. So when I got my Kindle, I made it my first purchase. I'm in no way disappointed. This really was one  of the best books I've read. It was sarcastic, it was sad, I laughed, I cried. John Green is amazing. This book deserves its Goodreads choice award. Everyone should read this book. You won't be disappointed.
B007T8BYWE|5.0|I love FlipPix Art - Model Plane because I do not like any game that has a time limit on it.  Thank you.
B00A77II0U|5.0|the story is great and I like having the hint option if you need it.  I wish there were more of these games
B003CSV7TK|5.0|Really enjoyed the movie when I was a kid and wanted to watch it for the holidays while I sew.
B005K17RU0|4.0|easy to use.  very helpful in planning<br />my day.  It doesn't turn with my Kindle like the weather channel app does.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love the different dealing options.  Great timekiller while I am on break or lunch. Easy to read the cards ss well.
B00APUYWYA|4.0|Great cast. It was like watching an extended episode of glee. Very funny. The plot was somewhat predictable but the acting was great.
0385737955|5.0|this book and is begging for the prequel and sequel. Anything that makes a boy read voraciously is a big WIN!
B004SUDPXW|5.0|seeing so many episodes just makes you want the next year. Unfortunately there will onl y be one more season
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Outstanding reading and story. Brings hope to a world in chaos. We need More books like this to inspire us
B0058YPG2K|5.0|can't get enough of this show, I feel bad that there aren't more in the offing. too bad this show should go on
B005LAII12|2.0|While there are some funny parts, the movie as a whole is kind of a let down.  I found it hard to stay focused on the movie and eventually just turned it off - I expected better from Seth MacFarlane.  While I realize the story is about a teddy bear come to life, the story line isn't believable or engaging.  I feel as though I wasted my money on this one.
B001E5CH0G|5.0|This is probably the funniest Christmas movie that exists. It is one of my absolute favorites and it also has action, drama, romance, and a good plot with its humor. It is one of the few Christmas movies that has it all in it. Again, Will Ferrell has made a great movie, only your kids can actually watch this one. The adventures of the human/elf Buddy is very humorous filled with ups and downs and a good happy ending. If you don't own a copy, you should still at least watch it every Christmas season. It is in my top three favorite Christmas movies. So enjoy watching it. There are many other great actors and actresses in it as well which just add to the greatness of the movie. I hope that everyone here enjoys it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once I finally picked up this first book, I couldn't put it down and immediately purchased the other two in the trilogy upon completing this one.  The book is well written, and the characters are engaging - as you read, you feel sort of involved, and you just want to know what happens to the characters (whichever one may be your favorite).  Before you know it, all three books are read and you want more!
B000Q6GX5Y|4.0|Everything seem right about this picture when i watched the trailer, and to be honest I believe the best lines of the script were said in the trailer, I believe there were times in the film when the queen just couldn't believe to herself what she was saying and that lead to a poor performance, the king's dialog was at times empty, Metal kind of music just does not go with this movie, the best performance I believe belongs to Xerxes.<br /><br />The movie was abundant in cheesy dialogs, some actors would have performed better if a nice script was provided.<br /><br />Picture was superb, acting was OK, this could have been a great movie, this could have been my favorite, I like these kind of films (Gladiator, Troy, etc) but i think i'll keep the movie trailer but not the film itself.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I didn't read the Hunger Games Trilogy for the longest time, but once I'd read the first book, nothing could really stop me from reading the other two.  The books are well written, with engaging characters and a great story line.  With every turn of the page, you just want to know what happens next; it's very hard to put the books down.
B0090EHVMC|5.0|Loved this movie! The animation was great and the story line was beautiful. It's a good movie to watch multiple times!
B003O86FMW|5.0|I didn't read the Hunger Games Trilogy for the longest time, but once I'd read the first book, nothing could really stop me from reading the other two.

B004EKCNMA|5.0|I absolutely love the animation in this movie. Although I have watched several different versions of &#34;A Christmas Carol,&#34; this is the best by far.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|I just bought the 7 days ago and worked 5 of the days but I had to finish it! Great fictional work!!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I loved this book. I couldnt stop reading it. What a great idea to get inside the head of both the husband and the wife.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I finished this book in 2 days the author does a great job at engaging the reader the story trails on and off and then bam a bombshell it's amazing.I was however disappointed when I realized the book starts months after the first one ends but the twists more than make for it.
B008JGSM6G|2.0|The game is OK if you are looking for ways to waste good time. But for me, all time is good and none of it should be wasted.
0805028846|4.0|Paper Engineering isn't so much new, but levels of challenge are interpetive.  I didn't find this particularly challenging, but you might,
0446343129|5.0|one of few books that could/should awaken populace to danger of SUGAR.<br />The poor little book is paperback with small font and so maybe not a delightful reading experience--but the content includes hundreds of years of history; since time sugar was introduced to human diet and hideous slave trade as result of sugar demand etc., therefore the 30-40 year age of the written text is insignificant to the information.<br />I bought 9 total copies for kids and grandkids--very quiet response. IT IS HARD to acknowledge the power of the damage sugar does to us all.
B008602KQI|4.0|It was a very good movie to see we saw it in the theater at least two times and cant wate to see it at home
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|love the movie, love the music, this is now on our holiday rotation list. couldn't be happier that we got it.
B0013TO3HS|4.0|This movie was wonderfully compelling with great special effects and an intriguing story line.  The cast is exceptional, and the newcomer in the lead role really embodied the novel's characterization.  Do be warned, though, some of the violence between species and the threats to the children in the storyline could be quite upsetting to young children.
B002AWX6UM|5.0|during the last 2 weeks I have read at least 5 books about Liberia and they have all been must read…this is one on my list.
B003TNW044|4.0|My rating isn't based on the package I received, it's based on the fact that I know Friends episodes are always funny/enjoyable. I can't rate the package I ordered, because unfortunately it was stolen and I never received. It was a Christmas gift for my daughter, but never made it to us.
1926778537|5.0|This book is beautifully put together and full of amazing art from cover to cover. I am immediately surprised by just how much art is in this book and how well organized it is. The Art of Darksiders 2 also appears to have been better made then The Art of Darksiders 1. The first book had major problems with the binding and fell appart immediately even when gently flipping through. I am being super careful with Darksiders 2 (just in case) but so far I am not seeing any issue with the binding. Crossing my fingers that it says that way! In any case, a must have book for Darksiders fans or art lovers.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|Fifty shades of greatness. I loved it from start to finish. About to go read the next book then the next book.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|This is an excellent processor. Not only is it fast, it is easily overclocked. The video is not too bad. It is also cheaper at newegg.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Overall, I really enjoyed the book, but there here times when the lead male's attitude really irritated me. The lead female  had a measure of patience way beyond anything I've ever encountered in anyone I've ever known, but then that's why it's called fiction...and I enjoy almost any book with an ending like this.
B00APUYN0I|2.0|Not worth five bux bux bux bux bux bx bux bux bux bux bux bux bux four more words req
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like this app. The games are hard enough to keep my interest without being hard enough to make me quit.
B001TODCII|5.0|Got it on Black Friday for two bucks! Was super excited when I got it and watched it immediately. Definitely a movie worth watching, I never got bored of it.
B004P12SSW|5.0|Christina is AMAZING in the movie. She even made a reference to her notable SNL performance when she played Samantha from Sex In The City. She was practically herself in the movie. However, the movie was so entertaining & inspirational. It really makes you want to get off your butt & make your dreams come true.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great timepiece with acting and dialogue. Extremely well thought out with characters and plot line. Fast moving segments that keep you engaged.
B002NWOOXW|4.0|This sequel to the &#34;Diary of Bridget Jones&#34; sees Bridget grappling with her relationship with Mark Darcy while trying to resist giving into the lecherous Daniel Cleaver.  Bridget is terribly insecure, and because of her constant need to feel worthy, she jeopardizes the relationship with Mark.  But she finally realizes how much he loves her when he comes to her rescue like a knight in shining armor.  I am a big fan of the British comedy genre for because of its witty humour; but I am also a fan of movies with well-acted female leads, and Bridget Jones is a character that many women can relate to.<br /><br />The only issues I have with the film are: 1) Bridget is repeatedly referred to as fat, when in actuality she is really average size (at least Zellweger's body is) and 2) It would be refreshing to watch a Western film in which Thailand and other Asian countries are not the subject of re-heated stereotypes.  Nevertheless this is a great film for anyone who likes comedy. Watch it.
B000NYT1M6|4.0|My grandson was very pleased with this gift.  I am concerned that it will be sturdy enough to hold up to a 2 year old's play.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Excellent coming-of-age novel. I resisted reading it at first, but it was recommended to me by a classmate after they noticed me reading \\"The Catcher in the Rye.\\" Extremely glad I finally read it.
B0066W1AZK|2.0|I found this program lacking in several areas.  Playing against the computer, the computer moves too fast.  The sound effects are too low even at the highest setting. The color difference between the pieces should be greater.  There is no placing of removed pieces in view on the chess board. I find it hard to recommend this program.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Great book with lots of action.  My favorite book series.  I would definitely recommend this book.  I wish there was more books in the series.
B00ABGEFWC|1.0|I downloaded it for my 7 year old's new Kindle Fire.  It will not start up properly.  She hated it.  Ended up uninstalling it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Great book! Good story line. I enjoyed it thoroughly. If you are looking for a good read, give this book a try.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I couldn't put it down!  I read the entire book in about 24 hours - I was hooked from the first chapter!
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|I wasn't sure what to expect,so I was pleasantly surprised when it turned out to next a very good movie. There are a few minor holes, but all-in-all everything works.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Okay so I'm a 11 year old GIRL and I love this game I have built a huge mansion and played with all my other friends all the time ( there girls to!) I'm actually next to one right now $6.99 worth it! Oh and personally I think that girls could play this to ! Big thumbs up! :D
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|I read the book and heard the old music but never understood the songs until I saw this movie and heard them sung this way.  It's so beautiful.  Les Mis is a very unromantic human story about real struggles and real feelings.  This soundtrack captures it perfectly.  <3 I LOVE IT!<br /><br />Don't buy this soundtrack until you've seen the movie!  The OLD Les Mis music is gorgeous and the singers voices perfect.  However, it was very romanticized and this soundtrack is so REAL. You may not like it if you haven't seen the movie.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I started reading these books when they first came out and I'm sad there is no more because they are amazing!!!!!! :-)
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|For a budget gaming mouse I am very impressed with this product. It<br />arrived over the Xmas break and though the outside was a bit beaten up<br />by the courier the mouse was packed and protected well.<br /><br />I have not used a wire moused for quite sometime and I was pleasantly<br />surprised with the braided cable which is of high quality.<br /><br />The mouse itself is well made and though incredibly light and does not feel<br />flimsy or poorly built. I prefer a much heavier mouse and I was not<br />disappointed to find a set of weights to customized the \\"feel\\".<br />I added all of the weights in which gave a feel much suited to<br />my preference.<br /><br />Like other users I noticed the sensitivity on this mouse to be<br />excellent so I went straight away and dialed it back a bit.<br /><br />Overall excellent value for the money.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|The only thing better than reading this novel is listening to the musical score. This is a must read for everyone. It's inspiring, tragic & relatable all at once.
0920668372|5.0|I read this book to my baby five years ago and now he's reading it to me.  My friend had a preemie and I bought it for her.  She says when she reads Love You Forever, he perks up.  She enjoys the book as well for herself and says, it is one of her favorite baby book to date..
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I  very much enjoyed this book. For one, this book has incredible features, text, and believable an very interesting characters.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|The Anker gaming mouse is a very good mouse overall!. It has great features like changing the sensitivity of the mouse with a button that it has. you can also record and play a macro with it. The only thing that would make this mouse better was if the mouse's left and right buttons were a bit harder to click.
B009X01C64|3.0|Good case, works as advertised.  My only beef: it's way too bulky.  I felt like I was carrying around the old testament after I snapped my brand new fire in.  No other complaints.  Solid product if you don't mind the extra heft/weight.  I returned my case for the micro shell offering from Marware and am much happier.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|Once you start you just can't stop playing.  it's a fun game to play and is very additive. Have a good time and enjoy yourself.
B005EGXNLS|4.0|It was a good story but hard to get the characters straight partly because the names of the characters were often  so similar and the names of the areas in England were totally unfamiliar.  I realize names change over a thousand years but a map might have been helpful.
B004KPLVV8|5.0|This was a favorite when I had it on VHS and this is an upgrade for me.  The DVD quality is excellent, and I enjoyed the special features.  It was new information for me that the characters were in suits, not CGI.
B007FJFDXS|2.0|I enjoyed the puzzle aspect of the game. It is too bad I spent more time struggling with the controls than I did solving the levels. Swipe gestures would have been a much less frustrating way to implement the TK gimmick.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|The game is ok. Not very challenging, and the story line is silly. But not a bad deal for under a dollar.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|This is a really useful app. Surprising to see how many people use it. You can find out about almost anywhere you want to go
B000FC1RCI|5.0|This book was great I recommend this to any reader. I loved the suspense and never ending plot twists.. .
0375869026|5.0|I saw this title on a great book list just before Christmas, bought it for my daughters at the school Book Fair, put it under the tree and read it while on break. I read it in one evening, couldn't put it down.  The entire list of characters reminded me of someone I knew, in fact I went looking at the end to see if the main character was a real or fictional person because I knew someone just like him in college.  I could have sworn this was Scott's story, but it wasn't.  The setting was dead on for the school my children attend, private...some well to-do parents, some not so much, many in between.  My daughter is in the 4th grade and this year they even went on a 3day/2 night environmental trip to a YMCA camp.  This book was spooky in how 'real' it seemed to me.  It made me cry in a few spots, it made me laugh, it made me want to cheer him on.  It was great to get inside each of the main characters heads, how they each have their own problems and the interconnectedness between them.  I like seeing problems from other sides.  And it was amazing to see the love and support the characters give each other.<br /><br />I have already sent a recommendation to the 4th grade teachers and head of lower school to add this to the summer reading list for the 4th,5th and 6th grade classes.  It is so similar to our 'real life' and sends the right message.
B007FRHZ4A|1.0|Light plastic pieces very hard to build the structures. Spend way too much time very gingerly trying to make structure only to have it fall down over and over from a light breeze, slightest bump, etc.
B0097UO87U|2.0|He's starting to have the same problem as Rod Stewart with his cover versions of old songs. I keep hearing, &#34;it's just a paycheck&#34; deep in the background. He has always been one of my favorites both on his own and with ELO but this one only has a few good cuts.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|One of the Best Movies of 2012. For hardcore Batman/Comic Book fans it has an ending that's completely understandable and will leave you incredibly satisfied
B001VFM60A|5.0|Probably the best live LP performance. And it's on Blu-Ray to boot. Has a few more minutes of the concert than the CD contains. The second singer (cant remember his name) goes on a political rant, but at least they segmented that part so a quick press of the button will forward you to the next song and spare you from this band's political viewpoints. Some people think they are famous, therefore important politically. Kudos to the producers for allowing us to skip that part and move on to the music.
B00APUQH0W|4.0|This older made anew Eastwood shows all the heart and hurt that was so lacking from his younger career.  Parenting regrets and work integrity seem to be part of this likeable, but failable person.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|It does it's job and it does it well. It is relaxing in many ways, from trying to get to sleep, to drowning out the sound of annoying family members.
143911000X|5.0|I actually purchased this for my friend as a Christmas present and she loved it! She is a major How I Met Your Mother fan, and she was so excited to receive this.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|Great movie. It has a good plot and a lesson at the end. I definitely recommend it. Watch it on a Sunday.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Great story/teller. Loved the humor and writing style. Engaging characters! Disappointed that so many spiritual issues are brought up and go unanswered
B002ZG975Q|5.0|grand daughter wanted this movie.  they rented from the library but i found it on amazon, now she has her own copy.  great movie.  you will love it.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Great love story with such a remarkable plot. Really makes you wonder if there's more to life than we see
1608199096|5.0|GREAT book! If you love food, Venice and stories this is a book for you. The recipes are doable, intriguing and delicious. But more importantly, it's a beautiful book to cuddly up with and savor.
068987474X|5.0|there are a few books i think everyone woman should have but this one is key. A guy writes this book and a girl writes with him its alot of question and answer it almost reads like an instruction manual/selfhelp book. We women need it bad. for example ever wonder why a guy just disapear or why are you dating but he wont make it official ever wonder if he is lying or why excuses or way say all these sweet romantic things and wonder later how coul he do and say those things and not mean it. this will put you on a straight path to see guys BS right away so u can remove yourself from the line of fire before you get hurt. I read alot of relationship books have always tried to understand men and relationships and this is one of the ones i get all my girl friends because every women needs to see this and also u might like the book your not that into him ither written by a different Aurthur basically showing you sometimes we settle among other things. Great BOOOK please add to your collection for the dating women
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Loved all the DVD options! I was able to share with my friends and family. Thanks for the excellent product and fast shipping!!
B0056JJ1M8|5.0|Movie has a great message and recommend that all teanagers and adults see this movie. Sometimes adults forget what should be the true objectives in life and this move shows how people often support short term objectives and miss real objectives in life.
B006LSZECO|4.0|It was easy reading with a surprise ending.  Keeps you going and wondering.  Lots of twists and turns. Highly recommended
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|So amazingly SKY-BEAUTIFUL!!! A perfect fiction with a dose of reality! I wish there were more than 5 stars I could give, because this book deserves them!...AND THE SKY HAS GAINED A NEW STAR AND HER NAME IS COLLEEN!!! I Live you Ms. Hoover!!!<br /><br />\\"I was in love with the way you loved me... When you wrapped your arms around me and held me, I knew that no matter what happened with my life, you were my home.\\"<br /><br />Mesmerizing, hypnotizing, heartbreaking and breathtaking BEAUTIFUL!!!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I can't believe how fast I completed the series of books.  Easy reading, great characters and look forward to the movie
B000Z6MIQS|5.0|Bought as a gift for son and he listens to it a lot.  He is very happy with the album.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book, easy reading and the continuation from one book to the other is great.  The characters are awesome. Highly recommended.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Not only are Dr. Alexander's experiences convincing, but he proves that science and faith can coexist. This book is so well written, I could hardly put it down!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Great continuationof the first book.  Every girls fantasy.  Enjoy reading  these books and look forward to book three of the series
B006KSAPV0|5.0|I always love Almodovar movies.  This is one of the movies where wardrobe is great and the story very interesting.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book is wonderful and Cinna is a HAWTEE ! ;)  Team Peeta 4 Lyfe . Gale can suck it!
B00013F38K|5.0|This is the original series. I got it so I could go back and watch them in the original order. Fun!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I bought this game on a whim and glad I did. It's fun without having to think to hard. I wish I would have realized sooner that it's good to keep the prizes instead of selling then for more coins to ultimately get even more bonuses. I'm now obsessed with getting the prizes. I can't wait to find out what I get when I collect all the puzzle pieces. It's looking like this game could go on for a long time.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The story was sweet and sexy at the same time. I would definitely recommend it to anyone looking for an easy read.
B00A6N8F4Y|4.0|Lots of violence&#60; i thought it was a good flick my wife thought it was a little to gory. If that doesn't bother you then its a decent watch.
B006LSZECO|3.0|I can see why this was a best seller because it was a page turner but I don't understand how it ever got 5 stars from anyone. This book is so messed up. Wtf did I just read?!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Addictive and fun to do at all times. Good clean fun for the entire family, but would love a way to get more coins!!
B0098VXE50|5.0|I just love this movie - great movie to watch and enjoy!  Must make popcorn and enjoy with family or friends.
B004XVMCMQ|5.0|If you like movies set in the English countryside you will love this movie. I could watch it over and over.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|The product is very easy to install, fast and the price is quite unbeatable. Cons: It comes with a weak cooler.
B001U0HAZM|5.0|this movie is awsome. only a handful of actors will go to this length to play a part in a movie.
B00000IQBN|3.0|Big fan of Epic type movies and I loved Ryan O'Neil but this movie did not make me love either one. The movie was just too slow and lack excitement. Very Disappointed.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I enjoyed this book, easy to read.  Read the book in two days. I would recommend to read it, sit back and relax and enjoy.
B003XF1OJK|5.0|This book is a great prequel to the Halo games. It explains how John becomes the Master Chief we play as in the video games and how the Halo universe was before the covenant attacked. Intensely recommended to any Halo fan out there! Can't wait to read the other Halo Novels.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I first saw this on a late night television viewing. I had to have it! This is most likely the most wonderful and gentle story and man and animal I have ever seen. If you don't love this movie, you must not have any feelings, a great heartwarming story and performed so effectively by Richard Gere.<br />BWF
B00AE2J5HI|4.0|If you are looking for good story telling, a villain you love to hate, a knight in shining armor you love to love, a group of underdogs you can't help pulling for this is the movie for you -- there is some gratuitous but expected violence to boot.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book moved me to tears on more than one occasion.  Suzanne obviously put slot into this one. It was great.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Part I & II are good.  Reader is pulled into the history of Nick and Amy's marriage.  The rest of the book was not at all what I expected.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Love this game it is fun other then the parts that want accrual money which usually with patience u can bypass these financially driven tasks or find a way to do them for free
0307352145|4.0|This book importantly argues that introversion is not a defect.  Cain's exhaustive research shows that it takes all kinds and that an introvert or two can be a valuable addition to any team.  We don't all have to be chiefs.  I've always thought that extroverts were often silly and irrelevant.  I'm glad to see I'm not the only person that questions the value of extroverts.  We need all kinds.  Problem is a loud bore can drowned out an intelligent ponderer.  But that's life, at least in America's culture.
B003YL4LYI|2.0|The remaining lead characters in the series have almost nothing interesting to do plot wise or developmentally in this installment.  On top of that, Martin wastes chapters on a new uninteresting lead that comes to nothing.  Throw in a major engagement that is only briefly mentioned secondhand by another character and you have the absolute worst book of the series.
B00628RVV0|5.0|I had seen this movie in the theater years ago and recently read and discussed the book with my book club.  Though this book was not a favorite of the others in the book club they all commented on how well written this book was and how it should a unique perspective on WWII and the Nazi regime.  I must say I prefer the book as the movie did take some liberties even though it followed the story closely.<br />The entire subject of the concentration camps is so horrific, but this story transcends the horror and<br />shows the importance of true friendships and how innocent young children often do not carry the baggage and hatreds we grow to accept as adults.  My best friend hated the movie because it caused her to have nighmares. WWII was a nightmare but as the author of the book points out - this world has many fences.  We cannot close our eyes to what is happening if we want to make this world better.<br />I would recommend both the book and the movie.  So well acted.  Bruno is a treasure.  Such a lovely blue eyed boy who had such a tender heart.
1451627297|5.0|The best book I have ever read.  I love Steven King anyway but this one was the very best. Yea Steven
B008D28HYS|4.0|But needs an update. I've completed all the puzzles. The randoms are fun for awhile but the pictures are the reason I love the game.<br /><br />I live with chronic pain and this is one of very few games/activities that helps me forget about the pain for a bit. Sometimes long enough to get to sleep at night.<br /><br />Please, please do some updates.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book tugs at all of your heart strings. It keeps you intrigued to find out what's happening next. I'd recommend to anybody!
B0059XTUEK|3.0|I boought this for my son for a gift and we watched it together. He really liked it...I guess I was expecting more of her life being told. It was just ok for me.
0810998718|5.0|Great Calendar if your kid loves Diary of A Wimpy Kid. My son has all of the books and movies.
B008NMT684|5.0|My two year old son loves this app. He asks to play it all day. Some of the puzzles are a little tricky for him since he is barely two. They will get easier with time. We paid to unlock all of the puzzles and for us it was totally worth it.  I downloaded another puzzle app and it was really confusing. They threw the  pieces on top of one another and was too confusing for my son. This one is better organized and easier for him to play.
B004SB60OC|5.0|Saw Christina this summer on tour with Jason Mraz. She was awesome! What a great voice! Hope she records more and more!
B009KS4XRO|4.0|This game is fun. (I was surprised to enjoy bingo)  Using it on a Kindle Fire. Would be nice to get more credits daily and not be required to buy them to play, but it is fun and I would recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Excellent character development.  Action packed and fast paced.  I couldn't put it down.  Definitely a must read and keeper for you personable library.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved the book. It is intense to say the least. I loved that the story is full of surprises but what really took my breath away was how the book is about thepower of healing.  This book is about how love conquers everything even incredible suffering.
B0015DROBO|3.0|SPOILERS: This was a disappointing read. I have not chewed on it enough to identify completely why though. As I read it I thought it was probably the public demand for such writing that may be the cause of my disgruntled response. What is the public obsession with heavily saturated unrealistic and sometimes disgusting sexual context? The main character (at least on the cover) is a mid twenties young woman that looks fifteen. There are multiple, many unhealthy, sexual encounters involving her in this story. The author cleverly uses this character to draw interest in the book and to prey on what I assume is the mentality of middle aged men who are drawn to these types of women and exploits. This is not even the only issue with women in the story. There are several story lines that involve unhealthy sexual relationships and sexual crimes that are abhorrent. I am not religious or a social Puritan in any sense and have no issue with sex in these story lines at all. I do feel however, that this story uses that as bait to carry the story and it is unnecessary.<br /><br />This is not my only issue with this book. Too many concepts are borrowed in my mind to make this satisfactory. I loved the mystery and intrigue in searching for answers to the Vanger story, but the deeper it ran the more concepts seemed to sound familiar. The religious undertones and grotesque crimes were very reminiscent of Dan Brown's books both in Angels and Demons and the Da Vinci Code. That was fairly annoying. The rushed corporate \\"wrap up\\" at the end was almost laughable when Lisbeth masqueraded around to steal money at different banks a la Shawshank Redemption, which led to the almost invisible paper doll antagonist's death, also as in Shawshank.<br /><br />My issues with this book had nothing to do with the style or writing itself. It was an enjoyable read in flow and in maintaining your interest. My main issues revolved around the thirst we all seem to have for quite vile concepts. In reality a middle aged man with multiple sex partners, including one that apparently looks underage would be frowned upon. Here we are led to not only accept but approve of such an arrangement. We are almost endearing of their cute relationship in the end. This same character is violated by another older man in horrific ways, several others face similar fates from family members, and we all cheer on such imagery. I think this book would have been just as enjoyable if those premises had been changed a bit. I am sure I am in the minority, but in my case, it will not lead me to read the remaining books in this series.iddle aged man with multiple sex partners, including one that apparently looks underage would be frowned upon.

B007M45PMU|4.0|A fine album, but not much past the singles. It'll in my coral for a month, but I'm not sure the whole album will make it much further than that. Though \\"Stubborn Love\\" will definitely be on my mix tapes for years.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|I am addicted to playing this game!! I love it and so does my 14 year old! It is fun and easy to play. I would recommend this to others.
B0035JRVBO|5.0|I never know what to say is my favorite movie but I'm certain this is on my top five list.
B009RX85N0|5.0|It arrived in the time frame that was promised.  I was kept up to date on time of release and price changes.
0307730697|5.0|This is an inspiring novel of a Navy Seals journey, life, love and death, and most importantly... GOD.  I highly recommend this book, teenage age and above- as this book is a bit too real and raw for a younger crowd.  Insightful, it will break your hard, even the toughest critic.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|Great way to pass time on trips ,work or holidays. Even my gf like to play it on the kindle in the car
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love the book it is so funny and your pictures are the best and I will never forget it because it is the best book ever
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|Saw it as a recommendation after another app purchase.  Found the free demo.  Loved it.  Next day, it's the Free App of the Day!  Woo hoo!  I play it every free moment I can.  It's amazing, a game staring characters you create!  How awesome is that?!  The game play is fun, appropriately challenging, and very entertaining!
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Ahh so good <3 can't wait for the movie!! The ending made it amazing! Deff. Could not put it down
B004FP1WX0|5.0|What a great story!  The whole thing is fascinating and they do a great job of being compassionate and sincere the entire time.  A great watch!
B0014Z4OQG|4.0|I like the different approach JJ Abrams took to make this film with the handheld home video feeling. The action is awesome and intriguing. Great watch in my opinion. The shakiness made a feel of my friends feel a little motion sickness, but it didn't bother me.
1582701709|1.0|If the \\"Secret\\" really works let's test it. We need a Secret practitioner, a true-believer to put together some cash; $5 should be enough, but just in case it takes the believer some time to get into the groove of things, let's make it $5,000. Just in case. Now, take that money and go to Las Vegas. Blackjack gives you the best odds, so let's avoid blackjack so that detractors later can't say that luck played some role in the winnings. How about roulette? Okay, roulette. Now, place $5 bets and every time you win let the winnings ride. It shouldn't take long. Did you win? Of course you did.<br /><br />We'll need a camera crew there to record all of this, and the casino must be chosen at random at the very last moment so that no one can accuse anyone of a set-up. That should do it. The casinos of course will begin banning Secreters as soon as they pick up on the fact that someone is practicing what was once known only to the very few enlightened gurus of the mystical kingdom of Avaricia, much as they eject the practitioners of card counters at blackjack (which by the way works and is no secret anymore).<br /><br />Why bother with all the struggle of visualizing a better job with unlimited income, when you still have to work? It's just too much of a struggle, and takes too long. No, let's cut out the middlemen and get right to the source: Las Vegas! If Las Vegas is inconvenient, there's also Reno, or any number of Indian casinos, who by the way, can use the extra income as at least partial reparation for the horrors white men visited upon them in the past while practicing the Secret and seeking more rangeland for their cattle herds (see, the Secret always worked in the past).<br /><br />Wait, maybe it would be easier if everyone just bought a lotto ticket and then visualized collecting that big check, being grateful all the while for that original one dollar to buy the ticket, last dollar though it may have been. I mean what good is a dollar anyhow? You can't even buy achocolate bar for a buck anymore. Of course, if everyone buys the winning lotto ticket on the same day, then the prize will be divided up and, well, there won't be much for each winner. Funny how that works. Oh well, let's not be too greedy. If anyone is lacking a dollar to buy the lotto ticket maybe some previous Secret winner could loan them the dollar, or maybe just give them the dollar, and a copy of The Secret, so they can get on with making their life wonderful. Pretty soon everyone will have tons of money and no one will have to work. Yay!<br /><br />What? It didn't work? Well, there's always \\"The Magic\\" or \\"The Power.\\" C'mon they're all working for Rhonda Byrne, Shirley they will work for you.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|i watched this movie with my boyfriend, he liked it so i bought it for him as a gift.<br />We really liked it, heart-touching.<br />I Highly recommend this movie.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|This was my second time reading this book. The first time I was 16  and now being 22 I still felt a strong connection. Charlie takes you through a ride of freshman year of high school and reveals the special bonds you make with friends. I recommend it for a quick read and I will say I'm quite excited to watch the movie.

B00000J048|5.0|I bought this set for my 2 1/2 year old granddaughter, who loves to take apart and put together items. It is a little advanced for her right now...but her daddy had a terrific time playing with it on Christmas morning. My granddaughter has her daddy's mechanical skills and her small motor skills are quite advanced for her age. I know that she will have it figured out in no time...and will love playing with it...that is, IF she can get it away from her daddy! :P
B004ZGI2KK|5.0|This movie had a &#34;Twilight&#34; feel at first, mostly, I think, because of the scenery. It was quick paced and kept my interest throughout. I enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone...men too. a grizzly twist on the fairy tale.
B007K3JFUQ|3.0|The quality of the cd was just ok.  Almost like it had been duplicated too many times as the picture was a bit grainy.
B006LSZECO|2.0|This book just seemed to show how self centered people can be.  Not for anyone looking for a happy ending or a good guy or girl. There wasn't one. Very cold and calculating. I don't live in a fairy tale world, but, this was beyond depressing.
B001OQCV6A|3.0|The quality of the cd was just ok.  Almost like it had been duplicated too many times as the picture was a bit grainy.

0545425115|5.0|The book arrived in good shape, just some details but I understand it's because the long trip. Anything else , I'm really happy of acquiring it.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Beautiful, powerful arrangements.  Amazing sound quality.  Love every single song on this.  There's up beat and catchy songs, there's slower and more mellow songs... This is music that just makes me completely happy to listen to.  Only thing that's missing is the beautiful video that accompanies this music on their youtube channel.  Perhaps a bluray should come out to get both the best video and audio experience :)  But this album will give you the best audio experience and you take it all with you and I just can't recommend it enough.
B009VSW15Y|1.0|I just wasted money when you scroll across the top and press photos it shows a screen that has no pictures well on the right there's a camera button on the top corner and that the camera it comes with. Disappointed and wish I could get my money back!!!!!
0525953728|5.0|Really enjoyed this book and the inside look at USL's demise. I see no reason for anyone to get into any trouble for writing it. It was written professionally and you could tell there were parts left out for state security reasons. Those times didn't get in the way of the story line, though. I would recommend this book to the military enthusiast.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book was phenomenal. It makes you reflect on the way society and oblivion determine who we are. It's worth reading.
B007THA4FI|4.0|It's as if Maeve Binchy went on a bender, became a mean drunk and found the seamy underbelly of English village life.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I felt both happy and sad for Charlie. Rode on that emotional rollercoaster with him as I read this book.  In the end, I too felt infinite.
B0019LY5IM|5.0|This was purchase for another individual. It was just what he wanted. He was really impressed by how fast it arrived at his housel
B008N1V11U|5.0|It was a surprisingly good game, the graphics were good for a app. Once i started playing i found my self putting my kindle down 3 hours later.
B009HELT3C|4.0|My kids loved the movie and the wife and I got a good laugh out of it as well. It's worth renting
B003ODIZL6|5.0|I love it !!!! it was a great I would read it again you should read it such a amazing book but it's so long but a great laugh<br />!!!!!!!!!!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Loved The Hunger Games, was somewhat disappointed in the first part of Catching Fire, but thoroughly enjoyed Mockingjay. Since I saw the movie before I read the books, it was far more interesting to watch it again after reading the entire series. I would highly recommend this book if you were a fan of Hunger Games.
B003VS0CX8|3.0|My Samsung Bluray player C6900 can't play the Bluray disc, even with the latest firmware update. However, the DVD is fantastic as always.
B009OYSFDM|5.0|Great NEW series!!!! Thanks for having it available for us to purchase. My family and I enjoy watching this show.
1400067820|4.0|I consider this a very important book. His crucial observation is that biological systems (bones, muscles, ..) get stronger from variation in work load (stress, rest). So do some human systems. But many human systems either only survive (robust) under stress or weaken and fail (banks). Instead of the wasting resources on the  impossible task of predicting the next Black Swan (Algeria, Egypt, Eurozone collapse, your PSA soaring), he urges us to become anti-fragile. Ok, he's flamboyant, cosmopolitan, verbose, strident--all of which I usually found entertaining.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Kewl movie but I wish I had more than 24hours to watch this movie after I started it.  I wish the rental agreement for Amazon changes
B002MQYOFW|5.0|If I could, I'd give this book just about 4.80 stars. The storyline was really cool, and the beginning was actually... good!
0439023521|5.0|I was a little skeptical about buying the books until Hunger Games came out, but it's worth the read! Better than the movie of course!
0767821629|4.0|This movie is totally underrated.  A neat look at the possibility that our world isn't what it appears to be.  Well acted and fun to watch.
B001OQCV6K|5.0|Sherlock Holmes is a great movie, and it's even better having it on Blu-Ray at home when ever I want to watch it. Worth the buy!
1451695195|5.0|I had heard about this book & read excerpts from the book on-line. It was not disappointing. I was particularly interested in reading the story of  a NDE (near death experience) from someone that was trained as a scientiest. Not that I don't believe others have NDE as well. But Dr. Alexander was a non-believer before this experience. He had been raised in a Christian environment but as he continued his training & work in the medical field/science, etc. field he drifted away from his early upbringing. Because of his specialized study in the human brain & as a Neurosurgeon he didn't pay any attention to the NDE stories he heard. He was convinced they were a results of illusions or hallcinations brought on by medications, etc. He knew what the consciousness of the human brain was capable of. But while he was in his 7 day coma it is documented that the consciousness part of his brain was dead! No activity! Dr. Alexander also spent several years reviewing his experience & writing down what all he saw & felt. He talked to the doctors that administered to him during his illness & coma. They all agreed that he had no brain activity. His experience affected these doctors as well. He vowed to not read any other NDE books until after he wrote down his experience so as not to be influenced by what others reporting NDE's said.<br /><br />I recommend this book to all believers & non-believers! It will change your life!
0439023513|5.0|I was a little skeptical about buying the books until Hunger Games came out, but it's worth the read and worth the money!
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I thought this book was phenomenal. It was recommended to me by my brother, and I was NOT disappointed. Wanted to read it before the movie comes out, and I was surprised at what a quick read it was (or maybe it was just because I couldn't put it down).<br /><br />I don't think you necessarily have to be a fan of zombie related media to enjoy this book. It could have been about survival after any natural or man made disaster.
0439023491|5.0|I was a little skeptical about buying the books until Hunger Games came out, but it's worth the read! I think the 2nd book is the best out of all of them.
B008XG1X18|4.0|...almost as much as the website!<br /><br />I think the app is very intuitive in it's design. The only reason that I gave it 4 as opposed to 5 stars is because if I have a computer handy, I'd rather use a browser to view the website over the app. I like to open potential pins in new tabs to view the website, and if you open the pin in a browser on the kindle and then return to the app, it doesn't always bring you back to the same place you were on the board/homepage.
B0043URV8M|5.0|This series is fantastic. I grew up on the books and the movie does it pretty good justice, even if the last book is split up.
B00A9C3RB8|1.0|It amazes me how Hollywood can accomplish their agenda.  First, the movie was rated PG-13.  There was no nudity and the language was not terrible, hence, the PG-13 rating.  However, the movie, simply stated, was filthy.  It starts out with an older couple, Streep and Jones, with a dull, lifeless marriage.  Streep wants some life back in her marriage and signs them up for a weekend of intensive marriage counseling.  The homo-sexual agenda was clear with the encouragement from the marriage counselor to purchase a book, &#34;Sex Tips from a Gay Man.&#34;<br /><br />I was sorry that I watched the movie and would not recommend it to those that are offended regarding sodomy and open marriage experiences or suggestions.
B007K3JCAE|5.0|I've seen both of the Sherlock Holmes movies, and they are great! I wonder if there will be another movie after this one - I plan on buying it!
0307278255|5.0|Jhumpa Lahiri's prose is outstanding. She writes so honestly and breathes life into the actions we think no one else notices and the thoughts we think no one else has. This book of short stories is truly beautiful.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The button are large and easy to use. It's very useful for balancing my checkbook. It remembers my last input so I don't have to start over entering my calculations.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love  this  app so so so much! It's the best app ever! The only thing is that on my friends phone and I pad the coins like shine... on mine the coins are just plain:( Someone please tell me why:)
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Still completely wrapped up. Can't wait to finish up with number three. I feel such a kinship with some of the characters and situations. Very deep and satisfying read.
B000002LN9|5.0|Eric Clapton's Live Cd's are always the best. Mr. Clapton takes the blues to higher levels each time I hear him. He is a master of the guitar and I enjoy the variety of different styles of music he plays on this and other CD's.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|An excellent wrap up to this tantalizing character that completely consumed me for weeks. A great read all the way through. Well put together.
B00003CXB4|4.0|dvd had scratches but plays good<br />dvd case was good<br />so over all good product for the gift for my girlfriends kid
B005HSG3TC|2.0|Ok case but not very sturdy. Ended up buying another kind of case to protect and provide different viewing angles
1455502758|5.0|I guess it is never easy to write about dying. More so, when you know it is coming at you, day by day, almost second by second. Christopher Hitchens, one of the greatest writers that Britain has ever produced and not even the tumor in his esophagus could stop him from writing. I have yet to read one of his greatest works, his memoir, called, Hitch-22, but for me, for now, \\"Mortality\\" has been a rollercoaster of a read.<br /><br />\\"Mortality\\" is a book, a short book collecting the essays that Hitchens wrote before his death, about his death and the way he felt about everything related to it and how his atheism led to rational thinking and emotion as well. He is honest and painfully so throughout the book. The details of the disease are not given and rightly so (since it is quite private), however at the same time, the pathos is there, the honesty remains and therefore, the connection with the reader.<br /><br />For me, the connection was in the title. The very word, \\"Mortality\\" is unsettling (I am certain that that is the reason it was chosen as the title). It just made me realize about the longevity of our lives and what we can never be sure of. Hitchens gives it as it is and yet at some parts of the book, I found his writing tender and sometimes frustrated. As he says about people providing advice at various stages: \\"You sometimes feel that you may expire from sheer ADVICE!\\" This could also be seen as the humourous angle of the book, which doesn't let go. He knows what he is writing. He is aware of how his physical abilities are declining day after day and yet what he wants the most is the ability to speak (which does become a concern later) and write (which is of a God-like status to the writer).<br /><br />This book moved me in so many places and in many ways. Hitchens writes without remorse or pity and that is how the book should be and I am glad it turned out this way. The writing is powerful and stuns you in silent contemplation, like a good book should. At the end of it all, Hitchens just shows it the way it is - death and life, the way it is meant to be, probably not sugar-coated like his works aren't, but true to life. True to the way it impacts people. The way he lived. All that I can say is that I for one, will be reading his other essays now, as this one just proved his genius to me.
B000HKW7E0|5.0|How can you go wrong?  Big laughs no matter how many times you've seen it over the years.  A must for Christmas.
1400077915|5.0|When you read a collection of stories by Alice Munro, you need to give yourself a lot of time to intake what you have read. To so to say, \\"soak in\\" the experience. Her stories speak to you, they communicate in a manner you never thought they would. They astound you, they leave you speechless and sometimes they also wrench your heart - that is the power of Alice Munro's short stories.<br /><br />\\"Runaway\\" by Alice Munro is the first read of the year for me and I could not be happier for choosing this one. Her characters are lost and sometimes miserable. They are regular people, spread across the terrain she knows best - Canada. Having said that, the emotions and situations almost remain the same. It could happen to anyone, what happens to her characters - they fall in love, they experience the disappearance of a loved one, they are unsure and above all they are just human.<br /><br />Alice Munro's writing is of a quiet kind. Nothing monumental happens at the start of the story. It is just a build-up to what takes you by surprise or sometimes shock at the end of the story or in the middle. There are layers to her short stories, which sometimes cannot be found in a novel.<br /><br />\\"Runaway\\" is a collection of stories about men and women who while appear sane and normal on the surface (so to say), there is a lot of emotional burden seething under. At the same time, they flow with the tide and give in to situations. Be it a housewife who wants to run away from her husband and life in the title story to a collection of three inter-linked stories about a woman Juliet and her life as it spans across time and relationships. Or it could also be of a girl grown up with her hippie and care-free parents, and waits as life unfolds in front of her, in an unexpected manner.<br /><br />There is no other short-story writer I have loved more in recent times than Munro. Maybe Lydia Davis but that's that I guess. A short story according to me anyway is more difficult to write a novel.As Jonathan Franzen, says in his introduction to the book, \\"I like stories because they leave the writer no place to hide\\". This is so true. Short stories demand a lot from writers and sometimes only a master at her craft like Munro can deliver almost every single time. I would also highly recommend Franzen's introduction to the book, which is a superb insight to the art of short-story telling and available only as a part of the UK edition.<br /><br />I am very happy that I have read only two of her collections, because there is so much more to read of hers, so much to take in - the charm and lives of small cities, of how life goes on, of how it unfolds, little by little and does not stop there. Munro's characters take a shape and form of their own. Her words get formed, slowly and steadily, till they become solid structures, which readers can go back to time and again. Here is one writer, who I hope continues writing, a lot more.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome ,I nolonger get AMC and Amazon Instant Video saved my butt from Walking Dead limbo. It's a tremendously addicting show.
B009ZE27US|2.0|I would not recommend this because it is not very accururate. This is just good enough for playing jokes. Thanks
B001BR5NN0|4.0|Great coming of age Movie.<br />All the classic High School Archetypes stuck together in detention overcome their differences and find common ground.
0061992860|5.0|This book is a miniature of the larger version. I carry this with me on our camping and fishing trips in a waterproof drysack.<br /><br />I have the SAS app on my phone as well, but you would never be able to read it all before your battery would loose power. So the book becomes a must for those wilderness treks!
B0030IG0C6|5.0|We have a load of Schleich figures and I've always been VERY happy with them.  The kids play with them inside, outside, in the car, and in the tub.  But, when my 3 year old took this glitter covered unicorn into the tub before I noticed, I thought it was going to be ruined.  I was shocked to find that it faired great after its mer-horse adventures.  It looks every bit as good as before.  I can't say I would recommend doing it on purpose, but it survived about twenty minutes of tub play unharmed.  That said, I did still counsel her to keep the adorned figures out of the water next time.
