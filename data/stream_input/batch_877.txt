1400064287|5.0|You have great ideas but how do you get people to understand them, to buy into your ideas? Finally, a book that explains in laymen's terms how to get your ideas to stick - as the authors wrote - \\"by 'stick,' we mean that your ideas are understood and remembered, and have a lasting impact - they change your audience's opinions ro behavior.\\" The authors dismiss some old theories of how to present your ideas. For example, many of us have heard you need to repeat your idea many times in different ways to get people to remember your point. The authors point out if you have to repeat your ideas obviously the idea has not been understood and will not have a lasting impression. You will find the six principles of a successful idea - the SUCCESs checklist supported by examples, stories, suggestions, and solid proven strategies that will teach you what others have done and have been successful when trying to get their ideas across.     Getting an idea, or your point across, can at times be difficult. It boils down to how you communicate the idea or point you are trying to make. Well, this book is one of the best books I have ever read about just how to do that. You will find actual true stories showing you just how a particular idea was successful, and why others were not as successful.     A must have book for every leader, for every teacher, for every student, for every employee, for every salesperson, for anyone who wants to get their ideas accepted. It is a book that gives you solid advice in a manner that you will remember and be able to use in everyday situations. As the authors state, \\"This book is filled with normal people facing normal problems who did amazing things simply by applying these principles (even if they weren't aware that they were doing it).\\"     We highly recommend this book and we encourage you to use SUCCESs checklist as a tool to help you formulate and communicate your ideas.
B000WC3AKI|3.0|I love disaster flicks. As a kid in the 1970's I loved whenever George Kennedy stepped onboard an airplane....you just knew that sucker wasn't making it to it's destination! How about \\"Earthquake\\", \\"Meteor\\" or \\"Towering Inferno\\"...loved 'em all. With the 80's disaster flicks kind of disappeared. The all-star casts shifted their attention to \\"Fantasy Island\\" and \\"The Love Boat\\" I guess? Anywho, once the millenium began to approach in the late 90's, Disaster flicks began popping up once again. And to make it better, special effects progressed from models and miniatures to full blow CGI mega-disasters.<br />With \\"Twister\\" coming out in 1996, you get a fun little flick about a group of \\"storm chasers\\" hanging out in Oklahoma during tornado season. The basic storyline is that they want to launch a new piece of equipment to study tornadoes from the inside. Basically a trash can full of Pokemon orbs. To do this, they must set the unit in front of a rampaging tornado. So we get Helen Hunt, Bill Paxton, Jami Gertz & Philip Seymour Hoffman running around the midwest farm country in a beat-up caravan meeting all kinds of cool CGI tornadoes. Luckily (or unluckily depending on your viewpoint), they do this on the same day that about 20 tornadoes decide to ravage a 15 or 25 square mile area of Oklahoma.<br />Sure it's unrealistic, but the special effects are cool. I did chuckle to myself when watching this disk on my TV with surround sound. I never noticed there was a \\"growling\\" sound effect added whenever a tornado appeared. This is a fun, summer movie and not to be taken too seriously. Like most good disaster movies, the special effects are the biggest draw. Whether it's flying cows, flying oil tanker trucks, farmhouses rolling around like tumbleweeds or watching a Drive-in movie screen disintergrate, there really is only one reason to watch \\"Twister\\"...and that to see things get destroyed. And this movie delivers big time.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Changeling is most famous for being produced by Clint Eastwood and its lead actress, Angelina Jolie.  Those two names unfortunately overshadow a disturbing true tale of one woman's struggle to find her son.<br /><br />The film follows Christine Collins (Jolie), a single mother rising in the ranks of the 1920s workforce in Los Angeles.  When the hectic workday demands of single parenthood conspire against her, Collins is forced to leave her son Walter alone at home.  And then Walter disappears.<br /><br />But that's not the story.  Changeling focuses on what happens to Collins afterwards.  The LAPD, under increasing pressure for its thuggish behavior, is desperate for an easy PR-win. When a child comes forward claiming to be Walter, the LAPD publicly declares the case solved.  There's just one problem: it's not Walter.<br /><br />What happens next is a heartbreaking tale of male-dominated institutions bringing their full weight to bear against a single mother without family, friends, or resources.  Fortunately, her plight gains the attention of Reverend Gustav Briegleb (the always superb John Malkovich), who uses Collins as part of his public chess game with the LAPD. As tensions escalate and Collins continues to deny the faux Walter as her real son, she is committed to a mental institution to shut her up. The story would end there, if it weren't for evidence that Walter was murdered by Gordon Stewart Northcott.<br /><br />The status of Jolie as an object of male lust often obscures her acting ability, and it is all the more evident here, where she plays a meek woman who only wants the police to find her son.  Her nemesis is Captain J. J. Jones, played by Jeffrey Donovan, he of Burn Notice fame.  Donovan seems a little uncomfortable in the role; he slips in and out of his Irish accent and he doesn't always exhibit the hard-edged indifference that makes the character so loathsome.<br /><br />Changeling's author is the eponymous J. Michael Straczynski, most famous for Babylon 5 but also a scriptwriter for numerous cartoons, Jake and the Fatman, Murder She Wrote, and Walker Texas Ranger.  Straczynski knows how to spin an investigative yarn and his attention to detail shows in the film.  This is as much a commentary on the changing role of technology, media, and women in American society as it is a historical tale.  Oddly, some attributes are glossed over: Northcott's mother is notably missing, as is the fact that many of the political and legal improvements made at the conclusion of the film were ultimately reversed.<br /><br />None of that detracts from the tale.  Whenever a child is endangered, every parent can't help but be alternately terrified and enthralled.  We keep hoping for a happy resolution, knowing that it will never come.  The best we ask for is that Collins finds some semblance of justice and peace - if not for her missing son, then for herself.<br /><br />Although it takes a long time to get to its conclusion, Changeling delivers.

0345495004|4.0|Loving Frank is a terrific book for a book club because it covers issues that are as pertinent today as they were in 1904. The characters are complex, not always endearing, but certainly interesting and remarkable. For those not very familiar with Frank Lloyd Wright, the book provides insight into his style, thinking process, visions and personality. One might not agree with everything he and Mamah did but one certainly comes away with a better understanding of Frank Lloyd Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney, and maybe appreciation for Frank's insights and style.

0451530977|5.0|Robert Louis Stevenson may not have known what he had created when he wrote \\"Treasure Island\\" for his nephew, but let's hope he had some measure of how many imaginations he would spark with this, the definitive pirate novel.    This timeless tale of youthful adventure and derring-do focuses on two characters - the young Jim Hawkins and the dastardly charming Long John Silver.  Jim narrates most of the tale, and while he's a young lad of thirteen or thereabouts, he's an adventurer to his core.  One of the most exciting aspects of this novel is watching young Jim take on challenge after challenge, risking life and limb, all for what he believes is good and true.  Whether it's facing down a murderous pirate, or seizing a ship single-handed, or sticking to his word at the risk of his life, Jim is as much a hero as Bilbo Baggins or Harry Potter.      What elevates the novel, though, is the nefarious character, Long John Silver.  Every pirate in popular culture stems from this magnificent creation.  Profane, noble, violent and gentle, Silver is a man for the ages - a peg-legged brute with a parrot on his shoulder and a cutlass in his hand, Silver is the stuff of nightmares and legends.  Playing both sides of the fence in his devious ploy to steal Captain Flint's buried treasure, Silver confounds Jim's moral compass and earns both disgust and admiration - no small feat for any author.    And through it all stalks the ghost of the murderous pirate, Captain Flint.  Forever offstage but never far from our hearts, Captain Flint terrifies even the hardiest soul.      When you close the book after reading the last page, you can't help but drift off to sleep with visions of sailing the seven seas, searching for buried treasure, and hearing that parrot squawk, \\"Pieces of eight!  Pieces of eight!\\"      A timeless classic that holds up despite all its imitators.
0071359168|5.0|Al Ries and Jack Trout did a phenomenal job in explaining their positioning theory in great detail in only 243 pages.  The information was clear, consistent, and easy to read.  The use of examples throughout the book made understanding the concepts very easy and painless.  The concept of positioning almost seems like common sense after reading Ries and Trout's book.  The concept of brand leaders and followers seems so simple that it is amazing how some companies can ignore these rules.  Every business student (not just marketing) should be required to read this book and put these ideas and theories to action.  Entrepreneurs would also be another group who would benefit from reading this.  Knowing how to position your product against the competition, effectively name your brand/product, and take the appropriate steps to implement positioning strategy is critical to success in the small business world, especially in the tough economy that we are currently facing.

B0002BO05S|1.0|this is the worst, most biblically incorrect, boringness  movie I have ever watched. I mean, not one scene was portrayed correctly; from Jesus being baptized to his picking of his disciples, the woman caught is adultery, the wilderness of 40 years , Saul not being converted to Paul after the resurrection, raising Lazarus, and many more. There were several scenes where the actors were striking a pose, meaning they didn't move as if they were frozen when they were being filmed. Horrible move. It even loaded slow to the point that I thought is was damaged. The only good thing is that I bought it online with Amazon.
0743455967|5.0|I started reading this with my writing community on LiveJournal.com. The first part is somewhat an autobiography. The book lends itself to be divided in half. The second cranks out tip after tip about writing. If you are a beginning writer, a writer that could use a push, a stellar writer, or a reader of oh just about anything you would enjoy this book. It is a bare bones look at the work of writing. There are no get published quick tips and you won't find directions to the nearest great idea vendor. I think it is an honest appraisal of the work. I think he did a terrific job making the material interesting. I have been a fan for a long time. It was nice to be invited in to his writing world for a while. My favorite part of the entire affair is the passion he conveys about writing. That alone is encouraging.

B000TM0298|4.0|This is the most comprehensive video collection of Gary Moore's blues music. We get his shows in Montreux from 1990-2001. The beautiful stage and the talented musicians who back him make all his performances more interesting, but I would like complete concerts of all the shows presented in this collection, though. His 1990 performance is released in its entirety on a separate video, but the rest can only be enjoyed here, cut up and abridged. Also, this collection should be released in NTSC Region 1 format to allow The Americas to obtain it more easily and be able to view it on more DVD players.
B0012GMUPO|2.0|While \\"Trash\\" has some excellent songs on it like \\"Hell Is Living Without You\\" and \\"Bed Of Nails\\", the album seems too commercial and too ballady, esecially since it's the follow up to Cooper's heaviest album \\"Raise Your Fist And Yell\\". In my opinion this is the only Alice Cooper album not worth owning.

B001PPLIEG|5.0|What a moral morass is \\"Quantum of Solace.\\" But what movie-making! Daniel Craig is a James Bond hitherto unknown, with Director Marc Forster taking him to places never before explored.<br /><br />Quantum: the smallest amount of a physical quantity that can exist independently. If Bond (with Craig wearing his clothes and his mentality) receives just a quantum of solace (that smallest amount) by movie's end, then how much revenge filled his brain, his heart, his very essence? This is a Bond unstoppable, unimaginable, brutal--the epitome of a cold-hearted killer who seemingly just stepped out of an opera house peopled with evening clothes or the streets ferociously gang-dominated, tux on, weapon in hand, seeking that quantum of solace. Beware!<br /><br />This is a Bond that even \\"M\\" cannot control. She tries. Lord help her, she tries. Bond's job is on the line, her job is on the line. Never before has \\"M\\" been anything than totally self-assured, but this is an \\"M\\" who finds herself behind the matresses, a woman reduced to just a woman who removes her makeup at night like any other woman who works a 9-5 job. Only \\"M\\" is supposed to be a force of power, control, behind-the-scenes domination. Who took her whip? Bond, of course. His mission is not impossible nor is his identity a mystery. All he seeks is a quantum of solace.<br /><br />So a British man of mystery to the unknowing eye is really a secret agent with a license to kill. And kill Bond does--without hesitation, without remorse, without doubt. He spares only two moments to matters other than his revenge-driven quest: he gingerly embraces his old friend Mathis, and he has the obligatory sex scene. The embrace is necessary, even the scant sex scene is incongruous in context and should have lay on the cutting room floor, and initially erased right out of this script.<br /><br />What the reviewer on the product page calls the \\"Bond girl\\" is an insult to the character of Camille (Olga Kurylenko). This is not the same-ol', same-ol' sexy girl who makes Bond's acquaintance in bed. This is an equal, also seeking a quantum of solace. Let the viewer take note: Everything is new about this Bond film.<br /><br />Even the villain is less than a pure force as in the past. Superficially benevolent, he is buying up dry lands (with water on them) to make a killing (take that literally and metaphorically). Only in the occasional moment does this villain show his hidden evil. Why the lessening of caricature so notable in previous Bond films? To contrast Bond's unrelenting force of revenge? To show that all characters are capable of their opposite? Or perhaps to show the moral morass that our universe has become?<br /><br />The outcome of Bond's quest is, of course, expected.

B001LRJH0U|3.0|Of all films I have seen involving Ed Harris, it is this particular film where he showed his mettle and I think that's because he gets more screen time here than ever. This film is very engaging and his character is a complex one, the dialogues are spoken with an accent that takes a bit of time to catch up with. I've always been a big Viggo Mortensen fan and I think he rocked in his performance of the supporting actor. The of-late seldom seen, Renee Zellweger, acted quite well to giving the film an interesting storyline. While Appaloosa is much better than many lukewarm films I've seen in the recent past, it does get slightly weary towards the middle and end. Also, because it is a Western and involves a lot of action, keep your logic in the closet and watch.
1596590440|3.0|well structured thinking, however, I found the rather sensationalist claims that things are 'doomed for failure' if not following this approach a bit too much.  Watkins trys to segment his whole approach into different business needs, STARS - start up, turn around,realignement etc.  This is a good thought, however, as he also states, it is rarely that finely cut.    Lots of good thoughts to take away and a useful book.  He can write well, but Michael Watkins is a terrible speaker and should not have been used to read this book on the audio - REALLY hard going trying to stay listening to him!!

B001TH16DI|5.0|I almost hesitated buying this after seeing so many 1-star ratings (before this was available) from people who never saw the blu-ray set. This picture and sound is amazing and I don't think it could have been a better transfer without artificially enhancing the original. I am glad I judged those people as unethical for reviewing what they had not seen. This is now my favorite box-set I ever bought, blu-ray or otherwise. I wish Amazon would only allow reviews from people that have purchased the reviewed item from Amazon. This may sound harsh, but based on the amount of false reviews this set had before it was released, I feel it warrants some corrective action from Amazon. I would like to look at an overall rating and know there is some validity in it's source, and not unethical people wishing to voice their opinion on what they wanted to see released, thus rating something they had not seen. They obviously need an outlet, but this is not it.
B001V9LPWQ|5.0|Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs is a classic film that is one of my all time favorites. Walt Disney's first full animated feature film its an artistic masterful achievement. The film was a great triumph in 1937 and is still a great triumph today, nearly 73 years after. Aside from being the first animated film and the one that paved the way to the creation of the Disney empire as we know it today with dozens of many animated films in its catalogue most of them redeemed as classics today, Snow White happens to be a fantastic film. It has a great plot, a great story with great characters, music and heart. This makes this film as fresh as it was in its original theatrical release so many years ago. Disney has always treated this masterpiece as such and in 2001 it was release as a 2-Disc Platinum edition DVD. This DVD was the best of the Platinum line and one of the best DVDs ever produced. Disney again does the film justice releasing it now as part of the Diamond line in Bluray and the results are better than ever.<br /><br />Snow white looks fantastic in hi def with vivid colors, sharpness and a clean transfer. The Platinum looked terrific but Disney topped themselves with this new transfer. Absolutely marvelous. The DTS MA 7.1 is also very crisp and clear but don't expect it to rock your house. Nonetheless, is a great audio. Purists will be glad that the original mono track has been also restored and included here.<br /><br />The Platinum Edition was a pioneer for the vast content that had about the movie., This Diamond edition does the same in a more interactive way that inmerse you much more in the world of Snow White. The Hyperion Studios feature is fantastic.<br /><br />The only negative thing I can count is that not everything from the Platinum Edition has been carried over to the Diamond. If you(like me) are an avid fan of Snow White, you should hold onto both because together they make the ultimate deluxe edition of this film. The DVD that is included here also looks fantastic and better than the Platinum. A 5.1 DEHTM is also included.<br /><br />As you can see, this diamond edition of Snow White is deluxe treatment for a deluxe film. While is unfortunate that not everything from the Platinum got place here, this new edition is oustanding nonetheless. Just Buy it. Completely Recommended.<br /><br />Note: This film is presented in its original aspect ratio of 1.33:1 fullscreen which is the right aspect ratio of the film. Viewers who want a widescreen experience can watch the film with Disneyview that fills the black bars with backgrounds similar to the ones in the film.looks fantastic and better than the Platinum.

031606792X|1.0|Caution: Review, followed by spoilers (marked by **SPOILER ALERT**)    A confession: I'm 40, male,  and loved the first three books. My daughter recommended Twilight after she had read it, and I quickly outpaced her, devouring the first three and waiting anxiously for her to catch up so we could read the 4th together. But she balked halfway through the third book, and after months of waiting patiently for her I finally could wait no more and picked up Breaking Dawn.    My daughter is smarter than I am.    Part of the Twilight series' appeal for me was the tension. The love triangle, the uneasy truce between the werewolf pack and the Cullen clan, the awkward dance around Bella's father, mortal friendships rife with petty drama versus immortal love fraught with danger... Bella's story was made more interesting because it did not occur in a vacuum but as part of a larger tapestry.     Then Stephanie Meyer decided that to make everyone happy, she would let her fan club write her next novel. By committee.     That is the only explanation for what reads like the most indulgent piece of fan-fiction ever published. Characters run on rails spouting little more than clichés as they meander through a plot devoid of any real conflict or tension. Every conceivable plot device necessary is employed to ensure that no one is made unhappy or unduly inconvenienced and that any friction between characters is carefully smoothed out, no matter how out of character or ridiculously manufactured it appears. Any interaction outside the vampire or werewolf clan is limited to brief cameo appearances by Bella's mother and father, who are by and large completely oblivious or uncaring; as a result, without the backdrop of daily life as a contrast their passion seems artificial and childish, like a seven year old bumping naked Barbie and Ken dolls together while making kissing noises.     By the time I reached the end I had a migraine headache from rolling my eyes; I refuse to believe that the same author who wrote Twilight, a love story that fueled hours of discussion with my 16 year old, churned out this lifeless ode to self-gratification.     I will be one of the many fans who wishes that Ms Meyer had left this series as a trilogy. Breaking Dawn adds nothing to the series besides poor pacing, lazy characterization and the biggest \\"Mary Sue\\" transformation outside of online fanfiction.    **SPOILER ALERT**              The book reads like Ms Meyer sat down with a checklist and a wishlist from her fans. Bella's going to be a vampire without experiencing some of the most fundamental events of a woman?   Sex as human, check (gloss over the whole issues of first time, never mind first time with someone who can rip you in half by accident, of course it's perfect).   Baby, check (course the baby grows up fast so we can gloss over the whole diaper, difficulty feeding, cant communicate thing).  Perfect half-vampire, half-human baby that drinks blood but doesn't have newborn vampire's craving, check.  Instant self-control, check (gloss over the whole ravenous, out of control newborn phase).  Most powerful vampire in the whole coven, check.  Most beautiful vampire in the whole coven, check.  Powers that negate any other vampire's powers, check.  And can use it to protect anyone else, check.  What about her relationships? No problem. Dad 'knows' but doesn't care, check.  Jacob imprints on her baby, and thus is now happy, check.  All the vampires and werewolves are allies, check.  Face down Volturi, check.    The only thing missing was a series of blanks where character names should be so fans could fill in the name of the character they wanted Bella to be with, and making Bella in charge of the Volturi. With time control powers.    If Stephanie Meyer did write this, she should be ashamed.

B000VWE5OY|2.0|When [[ASIN:B000E41MS6 Doctor Who - The Complete First Series]] introduced Jack, he was charming and fun. He flirted with everyone and had a great time doing it. Of course, they were going to make a spinoff.    And then the spinoff came and it turned Jack into a dull school marm in a classroom full of bland creeps. The first four episodes are pretty good but eventually it becames too apparent that Gwen, a miserable Mary Sue character, is going to be the center of the show. And she's awful. She has to always be on some kind of sermonizing moral trip. When she \\"accidentally\\" kills someone (who by the plotline fully deserves it) she gets weepy. When she is in a situation where it's kill or be killed - she decides to drop her gun and wait for Jack to rescue her.    And then halfway through the season the show decides to explore the rest of the cast. And they are even more boring. Tosh is sad. Owen is a jerk. Ianto has a sexy cyberwoman girlfriend. He's been hiding her in the Torchwood basement for over a year and somehow no one has noticed.    Even more fun, RTD just hits us over the head with his two sermons - pacifism and atheism. The former is typically hypocritical since he can't seem to write a character that might NOT deserve death to save his life. The latter is just irritating. How many characters can die and come back to life and go \\"There's NOTHING out there\\"?? Got it. The only difference between this series and [[ASIN:0842329129 Left Behind: A Novel of the Earth's Last Days (Left Behind No. 1)]] is that I EXPECT to be preached at with Left Behind. With this show I expect entertainment.     And then just as things can't get any worse, Gwen admits to having an affair (everyone is having sex with each other on this show) and then knocks her boyfriend out with Space Roofies (yes, I know the name is Retcon, but I'm calling them space roofies) and DEMANDS that he forgives her. He doesn't. But that doesn't stop this narcissist idiot from yelling at him. At this is when I realized that I was watching [[ASIN:B000P6YNSO Grey's Anatomy - The Complete Third Season]].     Stupid. Boring. Obnoxious. This is NOT what I expected out of a show that's built around Captain Jack.    I hear the second season is better. I don't see how it can be any worse.
0930289234|5.0|Definitely worth reading.Different from everything you've ever read.<br />Amazing story with great illustrations.<br />You must buy this graphic novel.
0316017922|3.0|This is a very interesting and provocative book, but, like so many pop social science books, it is marred by the author's lack of empirical research technique.<br /><br />Let me give an example.  (SPOILERS AHEAD)  Gladwell shows that the 25 most recent Nobel Laureates in Chemistry were educated at a wide variety of colleges and universities, most of them \\"not Harvard\\".  He concludes, peremptorily, that extraordinarily high intelligence is not important to scientific achievement; that is, roughly speaking, an IQ above 140.<br /><br />The problems with his \\"proof\\" are, first and foremost, a failure to understand the importance of regression in a statistical sample, to eliminate the influence of independent variables. Or in layman's terms, he ignores the fact that there are reasons people don't go to Harvard other than quantitative intelligence.  One person, for instance, went to Brigham Young.  He could have been so brilliant that Harvard would have snapped him up, but preferred BYU because he was a Mormon.  Similarly, two Nobel winners went to CCNY for their undergraduate work.  It is easy to conceive reasons why a brilliant mathematician might attend CCNY instead of Harvard.<br /><br />Or, a brilliant chemist might have poor English language skills; and Harvard could turn him down, despite an 800 on his math SAT, because of a 550 on the English or essay part.<br /><br />And, as Gladwell himself admits, so many people with very high SAT scores apply to Harvard that getting in is a crap shoot.  Harvard makes mistakes in its admission decisions, and plenty of them.  Also, due to the prevalence of the SAT as a measurement of quantitative ability, Harvard might simply not be able to distinguish between a person with an IQ of 140 and a person with an IQ of 160.<br /><br />Anyway, Gladwell uses \\"college attended\\" as a proxy for quantitative ability without any caveat, which is something nobody should do who has taken even a soft statistics course, such as \\"Statistics for the Social Sciences\\", in college.<br /><br />The book is full of faulty empirical technique.  Gladwell does not come close to \\"proving\\" his thesis; in fact, his attempts at proof are occasionally rather ridiculous.  Still, there are interesting and provocative thoughts and facts presented, and it is competently written.book is full of faulty empirical technique.

B001MEJY8W|5.0|This is easily one of the 10 best horror films ever made.  I've been watching horror movies for 30 years and I can only think of a handful that have haunted me the next day after viewing.     The makeup effects were astounding, the acting was top notch and I was completely surprised by the plot twist.       Avoid this movie if all you want from horror is \\"BOO\\"  type scares and a supernatural killer/monster.   If you like movies such as Miike's \\"Audition\\" then this movie is for you.
B001F290E4|1.0|Let's just say Seal should stick with his pop/ dance music. The remake \\"Stand by me\\" should have been left alone and... his version really is the pits...<br /><br />I don't feel the soul as this album is clasified as but a poorly made album, something you just throw in a blender and hope it comes out in 1 color...<br /><br />Don't waste your money, I rather die from the Swine Flu than to listen to this flop...
B001CW7ZXA|5.0|This movie was funny when it came out and it's still funny today--both because it's a classic movie and because I get tickled remembering how I got tickled then.  My husband and I didn't grow up anywhere near each other, but we can watch this movie together now and it's as if we're about the ages we were when this came out, and time gets zipped.  I laugh at the same things I laughed at then, and find he's laughing at the same things I'm laughing at.  Not bad for a 30-some year old movie!
B001J9YRGE|5.0|I'm not a big reader, as a single mom, I don't have alot of time for idle activities.  However, I borrowed it from a friend out of sheer curiosity (and have since ordered 5 copies for myself and others) and in just the first few pages, I couldn't put it down.  Three days later, I feel Blessed for having read these heart wrenching accounts of ultimate sacrifice and bravery.  I feel changed because of this experience.  There really are no words to describe how moving this book is.  Can you imagine, a single mom, who works 12 hours shifts, reading nearly 400 pages in 3 days?  I'm sleep deprived because the only time I could really get alot read was late at night.. but it was 1000% worth it.  God Bless Marcus Luttrell and the Naval Special Warfare Community!
0790744295|4.0|As a comic book and horror movie fan, I have to be mindful not to be bias in my review of Creepshow. Certainly, it is a fun movie, great to watch on a rainy night with a friend. This movie consists of 5 short tales of horror. While I would not say any of the stories are truly terrifying, they are all entertaining, and provide enough suspenseful and eerie moments to make it worthwhile. Good enough that I wanted it for my collection of horror movies.
B001PPLIEG|3.0|I am a big fan of the recent James Bond movies and definately had high hopes after Casino Royale.  First of all I would recommend that if you are going to watch Quantum of Solace then you should re-watch Casino Royale if you want to have any clue of what is going on.  I was confused from the get go and did really understand the overall plot until more than half-way through.    I would definately say that this is a different Bond than we are used to.  Call it maybe a more sensitive Bond or extremely protective.  The action is great as usual though more shaky camera scenes than normal.  It was simply ok.  It is definately not a bomb but it wasn't gripping as most Bond movies are
B0012IV3RS|4.0|Ripper To Shreds<br /><br />Fulci is quite respected in the Horror community for his often gruesome or revolting zombie films but somehow people overlook a lot of his other great works unfortunately. New York Ripper may be one of his most beloved pieces of art amongst fans & easily one of my all-time favs. I watched this one on some lost weekend & found myself playing it over a couple of times which is uncharacteristic of me but who cares. We like what we like & whoever said you be ashamed to admit such?<br /><br />Ripper features some of most tense, eye-twitching montages of suspense I've seen in quite some time & I personally think Lucio actually rivals Argento here in many respects. I can't really speak for others but the razor scene alone made me a bit squeamish although I have seen this film 5 times. Fulci's history in giallo prove to be one of his greatest strengths in film-making which include his overlooked classics Don't Torture A Duckling or The Psychic. Both are criminally ignored classics.<br /><br />There has been much talk of the overall kinkiness this film proudly exhibits & how Fulci himself allows his artwork to be reduced to this low common denominator. This may very well have been the case but how about looking at how well the death scenes are executed & the excellent use of color or lighting during these scenes of human depravity? Are we so narrow in our viewings that we cannot somehow appreciate the artistry that Fulci was capable of dishing out in heavy doses? Ripper also has an amazing music score which isn't unlike some of the classic mystery shows on television which is totally impressive. Most importantly, who better to play the New York Police detective than Jack Hedley, who delivers a crisp but cool performance to match the film's icy touch.<br /><br />Sadly, we don't get to see films like this anymore or we get heavily sanitized versions of great horror in which the MPAA has had their field day. Yes, we might get a decent horror endeavor that's snipped to ribbons but the unedited versions aren't always readily available. Snatch this one up while you still can from Blue Underground & skip the garbage that seems to fill up the multiplexes. You will be glad you did.<br /><br />For more great serial killer fun, check out Lustig's Maniac & Palumbo's Murder-Set-Pieces but make sure you get the Director's Cut.the unedited versions aren't always readily available.

B000O77SOK|5.0|Courtroom drama can be very exciting, educational and humorous. I find all three in \\"The Practice\\" DVD's. I hope to obtain all issues of this program as well as \\"Boston Legal\\".
B001MYIXAC|3.0|It would seem this \\"one\\" has managed to captivate quite a few moviegoers & has enthralled it's audiences which simply amazes me. Perhaps baffled is the word I'm looking for. Actually, I was quite stoked about the idea of a really cool vampire flick which seemed to do so well with both audiences/critics alike & was even hoping to catch it on the big scream last year. Boy, I was in for quite a shock. What a snoozer! It took me three consecutive attempts to watch it all the way through.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. The film is certainly ok as far as artsy films or just average Horror films go but we've all seen much better in days gone by. As far as vampire movies are concerned, this may be one of the better recent ones but what do we really have to compare it to? Surely not Twilight which for some reason unbeknownst to me I actually find more entertaining. Eek.<br /><br />Perhaps LTROI just doesn't cover enough new territory or seems rather ridiculous when it re-visits old themes recycled from thousands of other films. We've all seen at least one teenage angst movie in our times where the kid is bullied to a breaking point & must eventually retaliate or suffer horrendously. This theme is well worn out & sadly doesn't help carry the story through in my opinion.<br /><br />The cinematography? What was teh big deal here? The scenes mostly take place at night so what are we supposed to be looking for? When Oskar meets his young friend, he can only meet her at nite outside their apartment building in the snow. Sorry but I fail to see anything amazing about snow covered grounds filmed during ungodly hours. Winter films can be extremely attractive of course but only in fleeting moments do we get a look at something besides gutteral darkness or pitch black skies with snow-filled playgrounds.<br /><br />Love themes have a tendency to warm hearts or make people long for something they rarely experience outside of the local multiplex so I thought surely this would be helpful but I'm not very touched by this fruitless attempt either. Much of the dialogue seems awkward for the most part & even a bit forced. As much as I really hate to admit this but Twilight might actually have the upper hand on building more tension or jerking unexpected emotions from it's viewers.<br /><br />Try as I might, I can find very little here to get excited about nor anything much to delight the eyes in the annal of fantastic cinema. This is pathetic excuse when an arthouse or foreign film can't even begin to rank with a bubble gum teeny bopper film.<br /><br />The special effects? Ehh. Don't get me started. I don't get it. Much of it looks like something out of an average eighties film & even reminds me of rank Stephen King material although I prefer King to this drab effort any day of the week. There are a couple of semi-clever moments here such as the recently changed woman who is attacked by a mob of cats in hilarious montage. Aside from that, the majority of the murders aren't too spectacular nor could the film be construed as very gruesome.<br /><br />Overall opinion? Skip purchasing this one & hold out for something else. Rent it if you must. I wasted $15 thinking this would be the highlight of the year but am highly disappointed. I did, however, purchase another DVD around that time which is quite superior to most you will find this year entitled Otto; Or Up With Dead People.fruitless attempt either.

It's like you're there (and I was!!) front row  - listening to, and watching the world's number # 1 entertainer from only a few feet away.  This edition of the 2006 concert does Barbra justice. It's a Barbra-live experience like no other.    My highest recommendation!    Siep

B001UREJWM|5.0|Just thought I'd chime in to show my support and to give thanks for the group and their latest \\"heavy\\" metal release.  Featured is an excellent collection of ten songs from these iconic musicians.  Even the slow songs rock.  Dio's voice and lyrics are as good as ever.  The relentless bass chords from Geezer Butler and Tony Iommi guitar riffs wrap themselves around this listener leaving me wanting more.  Looking forward to the tour and hopefully yet another studio release.
B001MYIXAW|5.0|I heard a lot about this movie from a guy at work who really liked it, so I decided to pick it up on Blu Ray.<br /><br />I'm really happy I did!<br /><br />To start if your looking for a movie with over the top gore, non-stop action, or pretty boy big hair vampires...your in the wrong spot.<br /><br />I'm a huge fan of foreign films, and this one reminded me of why that is.  The movie starts off in a pure white setting, snow falling in what looks like an extremely cold town, from the light gray buildings, to the pale people of the town...it just feels cold!  The movie is actually pretty quiet throughout, but it really adds to the tension and feel of the surroundings.<br /><br />I don't like giving away story details in reviews so I wont, but just know this movie feels very real, mainly because of the school setting and home/family life.<br /><br />The blu ray is excellent, the scenes of snow cover forests and lakes really pop in 1080p!  And the sound is actually quite good also, a few parts are very tense and loud as the tension of the story unfolds.<br /><br />My favorite part about this movie is how the love story part is between younger people, it helps avoid all the real mushy stuff, Oskar and Eli really get along well and act very well also.  Its actually cute at times just seeing the two interact and try to deal with the issues each one is faced with.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anybody that enjoys horror, drama, love stories, or a perfect mix of all three!  One last note to anybody that hasn't had the chance to check this movie out...Make sure you change your audio setting to Swedish 5.1, and subtitles on, since the English dubbing is really off sounding and in my opinion distracts from the movies impressiveness!
B001IBIQU6|1.0|This is Depeche Mode's worst album, tied with Exciter, that they have released to date.  Martin needs to get his hands out of the collaborative cookie jar and keep his wildly diverse atrocities to his solo project and leave the dark, brooding, lyrical hostilities to Dave.  This album can't hold a candle to their last album, \\"Playing the Angel\\" or Dave's second solo album.      It seems that all the people who rated this album highly, must be middle-aged (45 and up).  Slow, simple and mellow has never been DM's style.  It appears that Dave has just stopped disagreeing with Martin since Dave has been tending to his solo project.  So now there is no balance to their efforts.  Also, Martin needs to stop trying to play guitar in every song.  The music on SOTU is so flat and lifeless, the fullness and range is completely gone. Martin used to be such a lyrical genious, what happened!  You can see it on Dave's face as well, for all those who watched Jimmy Kimmel, it was almost as if he were ashamed to be singing Wrong.  But his tune completely changed when he started singing Personal Jesus.    So if you've got a hankerin' for some classic (new) DM, please don't purchase this album... go check out  \\"Hourglass\\" by Dave Gahan instead!
B00127RAJY|3.0|I understand the fact that the trainer thinks if you only work for 20 min, it should be a difficult workout, but not sure if all the excercises she does are safe.  What hit me wrong right off the bat is that she encourages (actually doesnt give an alternative) jumping jacks.  I'm no expert, but jumping jacks are NOT good for everyone.  They can be very bad for hips and knees.  Generally, the dvd is ok.  Definitely not for the beginner though.  I work out 5 times a week and the beginner session was a little hard for me at first.  If you are intermediate and short on time, I believe this is a good dvd for you.  Not good for beginners though.

B001TH16DS|5.0|I became an instant fan of this intelligent ground-breaking sci-fi series from Paramount Television in its very first year on NBC. They didn't call the fans \\"trekkies\\" yet, but that was to come. And boy did it come!     If I recall, what happened is that NBC made the huge mistake of cancelling the series due to what in their infinite wisdom they called \\"low\\" ratings.    Well, let me tell you! That single dumb move by the programming department at NBC unleashed a fury that was unparalleled in the history of television at that time. Thousands of letters of protest were sent to NBC, and out of that fan fury the \\"Trekkie\\" was born.     Eventually, the protests became too overwhelming to ignore any longer and the Star Trek series returned to the NBC schedule. Proving once again that in unity there is strength.    The rest is history.    But it is a classic example of what happens when the \\"suits\\" at a large corporate TV network can't see the forest for the trees.
0061733199|4.0|This book has probably the most information packed into it than any other book I have read.  Unfortunately it only briefly touches on each subject quickly.  Much like an encyclopedia is crammed full of information on just about anything, but doesn't go into any one subject in great detail.     Also there are a couple of things that aren't quite accurate but overall this book is a really amazing field guide on a lot of really amazing skills.  However you want to try out a lot of these techniques before you try to use them in a real survival situation so you can figure out the fine nuances in each technique.

B001UREJWM|5.0|1980 brought together some of the most well respected members of the Metal/Rock community for what is considered one of the genres shinning moments. It goes without question that Sabbath took the 70's by storm but Ozzy felt the need to branch out on his own and allowed (whom was front man of Rainbow at the time) Ronnie James Dio to grasp the reigns and Sabbath become something darker, heavier and what many consider two of their best studio albums were released under Dio's reign of Sabbath. The question as to which was better suited for Sabbath in my opinion is irrelevant. Both Ozzy and Dio suited the music of their time in Sabbath and both are amazing vocalists and both are legends in the genre.<br /><br />So was I surprised when these boys got back together? Yes, I was completely blindsided when the news that the 80's lineup was getting back together under a new banner. When the initial shock wore off I was excited when I realized I would get a chance to see this line up live. I went to their show skeptical, hoping to hear all the classics of their time, and I wasn't let down. Just getting to hear them play \\"Neon Knights\\" was enough of a Metal dream come true to leave me satisfied. I went home smiling and waited and waited and waited and finally after many months of anticipation the news broke that Heaven & Hell would be releasing a completely brand new album with all original tracks, I was floored. I expected a best of, or a live compilation but no, years after their last studio album they were going to give their fans a completely new dosage of Dio era Sabbath, under the title of The Devil You Know.<br /><br />The album kick's off with \\"Atom & Evil\\" A track that is true to the Dio era Sabbath albums. Tony and Geezer are the first to shine on the album with a low riff bordering on the darker side of things which soon turns to pummeling bass lines, slow pounding drum work and some amazing riffing by Iommi. Dio shows fine form from the get go and once you hear his tone you already know this is going to be a quality album, it's all business in the vocal department, no filler. \\"Fear\\" the second track on the album kicks up the tempo a bit with a ripping guitar riff, bombastic drumming and more of those pummeling bass lines but soon Iommi cranks up the speed with some mildly fast paced riffing that shows these guys got some spunk in em even after all this time. The execution is flawless on The Devil You Know and the third track on the album \\"Bible Black\\" starts off with some well played acoustics and some mesmerizing soloing from Iommi, Dio's voice is full and strong and soon the track explodes into one of the heaviest tracks thus far. Geezer puts down some fairly complex bass lines here accented by more crushing riffs by Iommi.<br /><br />By this point the only one whom hasn't really shown off his skill is Vinny on drums, but what you do hear from him is quality and every now and then he breaks out some interesting patterns on the cymbals. \\"Bible Black\\" is easily one of the 'stand out' tracks on The Devil You Know and has some of the finest guitar pieces from both Iommi and Geezer. \\"Double The Pain\\" begins with some creepy bass work and then erupts into another chugging catchy riff from Iommi. By this song both Iommi and Geezer are on fire throwing out some of the best playing we've heard of them in many years. The vocals on Double The Pain are some of the catchiest yet and just when things don't seem to be able to get better Iommi shreds up his fastest solo yet. The fifth track on the album starts up with similar chugging riffs and some intense grinding bass work accented by Dio's to the point lyrics and vocals. Half way through \\"Rock And Roll Angel\\" comes easily one of my favorite solo's by Iommi which starts out backed by acoustics but later the riff from the beginning of the song fades in and Iommi finishes out the song laying down some very nice acoustics while Geezer  puts down some mellow B lines.<br /><br />Half way through \\"The Turn Of The Screw\\" is an upbeat track where Dio let's fly some of his finest vocals thus far in the album. Vinny starts to get a little more creative with his patterns towards the end of the track and both Geezer and Iommi accent one another with more upbeat riffing leading into yet another amazing solo from Iommi. One would think Dio would be the member to steal the spotlight but Iommi's playing on The Devil You Know is definitely the icing on the cake, the man hasn't lost an inch of skill since his days in Black Sabbath and some parts even rival them. \\"Eating The Cannibals\\" turns the pace up even more as both Iommi and Geezer throw down some of their fastest riffs and lines on the album, Vinny continues to use some interesting patterns and then Iommi again steals the show with some incredible soloing in the latter half of the song, this track is yet another stand out but the band isn't done yet, not even close. The eigth track \\"Follow The Tears\\" is easily the darkest track on the album beginning with an eerie organ playing in the back ground as Iommi shreds up some nice riffs, the song erupts into a barrage of chugging thrashy riffs, slow drum patterns and pummeling bass work by Geezer. This is easily my favorite track on the album and has has some of the most addicting riffs and vocals on the album, the track ends with some superb soloing and fades out with the same intense riffing it began with.<br /><br />\\"Neverwhere\\" explodes into a rollicking track with an upbeat atmosphere and has a faster pace not unlike \\"Eating The Cannibals\\". This track is pretty much straight forward Metal with no filler except for some nice soloing and a few complex B Lines from Geezer, overall one of the few tracks on the album that just sounds like your basic old school Rock/Metal song. Leave it to these guys to go out with a band on their debut with \\"Breaking Into Heaven\\" which starts out a slow rolling tune that soon turns into a mid paced riff fest between Geezer and Iommi. Theirs a couple parts where Geezer breaks away and his bass over powers Iommi and even Vinny manages some decent cymbal work but it's Iommi that steals the show again with one of the best solo's on the album before the band rips out one last chorus and then ends it with a simple fade out as if to say \\"We don't need a three minute long finale to blow you away!\\" and that's true, I was blown away after the first couple tracks.<br /><br />I waited outside for four hours to get this album first thing and it was worth every minute. All in all the band is in great form as a whole, nothing but quality music from start to finish. But as in all things there are those that shine on this album more then others. Dio puts down a solid performance, his voice isn't what it was back when these guys first banded together but still solid vocal's from start to finish and some extremely catchy and on point lyrics.

I waited outside for four hours to get this album first thing and it was worth every minute. All in all the band is in great form as a whole, nothing but quality music from start to finish. But as in all things there are those that shine on this album more then others. Dio puts down a solid performance, his voice isn't what it was back when these guys first banded together but still solid vocal's from start to finish and some extremely catchy and on point lyrics.

B00005K9QP|5.0|Aleady having more than a dozen Eric Clapton albums, and after reading his autobiography, I decided it was time to go back to the roots. This is absolute classic blues with a much younger Clapton doing a version of Ramblin on My Mind that is a must have. This CD sooths the soul and makes me smile everytime I listen to it.
B0000257O9|5.0|I just go back in time when I hear this CD.  It reminds me when MTV was about Videos and now I see that the DVD star has been killed.<br /><br />Either way, I had to have the album and the quick turnaround from the seller was more than I expected.

B001TH16DS|4.0|This is the first season of the original Star Trek series presented in Blu-Ray. The great thing about this set is that it includes two versions of the re-mastered episodes: one as was seen originally, and the other with enhanced special effects. Included are special features, such as how the show was re-mastered, as well as commentaries about the individual episodes. It's also nice to see a straight forward, elegant set without all of the awkward packaging that is sometimes found with other box sets.
B000LC55F2|4.0|Two magicians, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), started out as partners and friends, but then a tragic stage accident made them bitter enemies. Set in turn-of-the-century England, the film takes us behind the scenes, as it were, to learn the mechanics of magic, its craft, secrets, and showmanship. But this film is more about the men than their magic--it's about their obsessions, egos and envy. Angier and Borden do everything they can to destroy each other. They sabotage each other's performances, steal secrets, ping pong the beautiful assistant Olivia between them as a lover-spy, and contrive every and any advantage over the other. They intend to destroy one another, and one of them succeeds. The film gets its name from the third part of every magic trick. After the \\"pledge\\" to do something outrageous and the \\"turn\\" of events, the \\"prestige\\" is \\"the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before.\\" That description fits not only the magicians but their very own lives.

B001OQCVAG|4.0|While not as complex or frightening as Adrian Lynn's \\"Fatal Attraction,\\" \\"Obsessed\\" still manages to be an entertaining film. In one very crucial way, it breaks tradition with the average domestic thriller: There's no infidelity. There's an awful lot of flirtation, no question, but when it comes to faithfulness, the married man gets high marks. I'm referring to Derek Charles (Idris Elba), a Los Angeles asset manager. He becomes the object of a new office temp's desire, and as we see over the film's 105 minutes, she'll go to just about any lengths to get what she's after. I agree that this is hardly an original premise, and at times, the film seems more interested in being formulaic than in being compelling. But at the very least, it makes due with what little it has, which is to say that it's perfectly acceptable.    It's a classic scenario: Not only has Derek just been promoted to the rank of Executive Vice President, he also has a beautiful family and a luxurious new house. He's respected by his colleagues, his superiors trust him deeply, and he has great friends. Things are going really well.    Then comes the day he enters an elevator and meets Lisa (Ari Larter), a sultry beauty with long blonde hair and a killer figure. She's carrying a large amount of paperwork, so much so that she inevitably drops them in a moment of clumsiness. Derek, trying to be nice, offers to help her out, and that leads to the next inevitable moment--they reach for the same piece of paper at the same time, resulting in their hands touching. There's nothing subtle about this. For that matter, there's nothing subtle about the entire film, which has no qualms about going for the obvious.    Take, for example, a scene that takes place some weeks after Derek and Lisa first meet: Derek walks into the lounge area and sees Lisa on the verge of tears. He assumes she's having boyfriend trouble, and encourages her by saying how pretty she is and how any man would be lucky to know her. In fact, ifhe was single ... ah, but he doesn't finish his sentence. There are two specific reasons why people do this: (1) some people don't actually mean it when they say it, so there's no point in completing the thought; (2) some people are afraid that they do mean what they're saying, and therefore don't want to incriminate themselves any further. What reasoning do you think Derek followed? Choose whichever one you think applies. I have a feeling the filmmakers wanted it to be ambiguous.    It isn't long before Derek regrets ever having met Lisa. In spite of the fact that she's incredibly efficient (at times frighteningly so), she rapidly becomes overly friendly, pretty much to the point of intrusiveness. It isn't until the annual office Christmas party that things begin taking a darker turn; Lisa takes advantage of the fact that Derek has had one too many and tries to have sex with him in a bathroom stall. He wards her off, but that doesn't stop her from trying again the next day, when she insistently gets into his car as he's leaving work.    Before I go any further, let me backtrack a bit and talk about Derek's wife, Sharon (Beyoncé Knowles), who looks bootylicious but acts, for the most part, like a typical wife and mother. When she first learns that a new female temp is working for Derek, she jokingly chides him for allowing such a thing to happen. Then the two actually meet, and while it's too early for Sharon to be suspicious, she definitely shows concern. Let's face it--Lisa's a beautiful woman and Derek is a handsome man. It doesn't take a genius to see what could potentially happen.    As Lisa's attempts at seduction grow more and more brazen, Derek finds himself in a very awkward position, desperate to maintain his reputation but even more desperate to distance himself from Lisa. There inevitably comes a point at which Sharon finds out that something isn't quite right, that Lisa labors under the delusion that Derek is in love with her. This paves the way for the final confrontation, which, for me at least, was the weakest section of the film, designed less like a plausible plot point and more like an excuse to have two women fighting. I have no doubt many will see this movie specifically for this scene.    There are other aspects that don't work too well, including a strange camaraderie between Lisa and a gay office assistant named Patrick (Matthew Humphreys). Within the context of this story, I failed to see how this character was necessary--other than a few stereotypical one-liners and some witty banter, he contributes nothing to the story. There's also Derek's office buddy, Ben (Jerry O'Connell), a sex-hungry party animal who seems to lack the conviction of his personality. He too contributes nothing to the story. Fortunately, these are side characters that have little bearing on either the central story or the three main characters, all of which are the most developed components of \\"Obsessed.\\" While hardly a masterpiece, it's an entertaining thriller that achieved exactly what it wanted to achieve. And even if Beyoncé Knowles is better suited for more meaningful characters like Etta James, she has once again proven herself as a competent actress.

1416550542|4.0|I was afraid this was going to be just another girly, historical fiction story, but there was enough intrigue and spirit of adventure to hook me right away.<br /><br />Cassandra's grandmother dies, leaving her a romantic cottage in England and a multi-generation mystery to sort out. Secrets are uncovered through old diaries, an enchanting hidden garden is discovered and fixed up, and she even finds a handsome and deep guy to help with the heavy lifting (though it's not heavy on the romance).<br /><br />The mystery unfolds from the point of view of three generations of women. Normally the time and character shift would distract me, but this was so well done that I didn't mind a bit when the view point shifted. In fact, I loved that each viewpoint character had different pieces of the mystery, so as the reader, I felt like I was putting the pieces together on my own.<br /><br />The story had a charming and somewhat old-fashioned feel that I found refreshing, but not dull. If any of this sounds interesting to you, I think you'll find it an enjoyable read.
055380684X|5.0|How do people get good at something?  Wait a minute, that's the not the right question, how do people get great at something?<br /><br />Well, frankly, there has been a significant amount of research on the matter of human performance and the development of skill/talent.  Author, Daniel Coyle, has looked at the research and he also went on a road trip to what he calls \\"talent hotbeds\\", places where great talent has been produced out of proportion to their size and perceived stature; for example, a Russian tennis club, a music school in Dallas, a soccer field in Brazil, and others.<br /><br />Coyle shares what he learned in this excellent book,  \\"The Talent Code\\".  The Talent Code covers three basic areas:<br /><br />1) Deep practice.  Practice is important to world-class performance.  I guess everyone knew that already, huh?  Well, sometimes, it doesn't hurt to remind of everyone of the obvious.  What might be a little more helpful is the understanding of \\"how\\" to practice.  What constitutes \\"deep practice\\"?  This is the kind of practice that separates the great from the not-so-great.<br /><br />The understanding of \\"deep practice\\" involves an understanding of a substance called \\"myelin\\".  Myelin is the insulation that wraps around nerve fibers.  According to Coyle, myelin turns out to be a very big deal in the development of skill.  Myelin is increased through deep practice and, in turn, increased myelin affects the signal strength, speed and accuracy of the electric signals traveling through nerve fibers.  This increase of myelin and its effect on neurons has more to do with skill development than had previously been realized.<br /><br />2) Ignition.  If a person is going to invest the amount of time and passion and concentrated, difficult practice that produces high-level skill, that person will have to be deeply motivated.  This is the aspect of skill development that Coyle refers to as \\"ignition\\".  Coyle writes, \\"Where deep practice is a cool, conscious act, ignition is a hot, mysterious burst, an awakening.\\"  This deep passion is a necessary part of the attainment of great skill.<br /><br />3) Master coaching.  World class talent requires help and feedback and guidance from disciplined, committed, coaches.  Think of this as the wise, older sage who can tell the student what he can't tell himself.  The development of great skill seems to require the help of people who have the ability to grow talent in others.<br /><br />Much of the content of \\"The Talent Code\\" reminded me of the book, \\"Talent Is Overrated\\" by Geoff Colvin, they contain many of the same insights regarding the development of talent.  I loved both of these books and they are both worth reading.  One of the encouraging and motivating truths that these books reveal is that great skill can be attained by virtually anyone who is willing to sincerely and passionately make the necessary commitment to its development.  But, as one of the lines in the book suggests . . . \\"Better get busy.\\"<br /><br />Dan Marler<br />Oak Lawn, ILakening.\\"  This deep passion is a necessary part of the attainment of great skill.    3) Master coaching.

B00006HAZG|2.0|Well recently I had the opportunity of watching BBC's David Copperfield miniseries in its ENTIRETY, for FREE! Thank you Masterpiece Online - that way I didn't have to pay for it. Produced in 1999, this is one of the more famous versions. They had a big budget, which allowed for detail in costume and sets, and a roomy time slot, meaning more scenes. It generally meets with ecstatic reviews about the cast and accuracy to the book. Overall, however, it didn't quite meet my expectations in that I, on the contrary, found it dull and slightly \\"off\\".      Though the production is quite accurate, it's adherence to the book plot means a one-dimensional,  literal interpretation of the storyline, lacking in much of the nuances of Dickens' original story.  When the producers did use artistic license with the scenes the changes often seemed out of character, and created different dynamics between certain characters. Take David's proposal to Dora. He would not yank Jip away from Dora! Agnes would never even hint at marrying Uriah (whose ending changes so he is sent to Australia, along with the Micawbers, who went there to escape him...weird choice). Also, the incorporation of famous English actors into minor roles meant the sacrifice of more important characters, like Tommy Traddles. Traddles is necessary as foil to both Steerforth and Uriah Heep. They had Janet and Mrs. Crupp, why not skip them and keep Traddles?      Acting ability was mixed, I found.  Peggotty was brilliant and perfect, I'm glad the producers realized she is supposed to be young.  Maggie Smith gave a winning performance as Aunt Betsey, and both Murdstones as well as Mrs. Steerforth and Rosa Dartle were chilling villains to contend with.  But Bob Hoskins played a rather serious, uninspired Micawber (though his interactions with Imelda Staunton were actually quite funny); Mr. Wickfield seemed reduced to a spluttering, Shakespearean caricature; and Nicholas Lyndhurst failed to  capture the essence of the book's villain - with Uriah Heep, there's supposed to be a big contrast, he's really fawning and obliging through the first part, then at the climax he snaps and becomes vicious and insulting.  Lyndhurst's villainy extends to shooting the evil-eye at everyone present.  Cieran McMenamin was a horrible choice for the adult David Copperfield; David is supposed to bright and optimistic, if a little \\"blind\\" sometimes. McMenamin did not pull this off. He had ONE flat cadence he used to express excitement, love, hate, or sadness. He had two expressions, confused or impatient, which often made him seem very selfish, especially in his behavior toward Dora.  His chemistry with Agnes was nonexistent.  I once heard Amanda Ryan's Agnes described as soppy, which is an accurate term - she is far to matronly for the part.      There were some lovely scenes (the storm was maintained and very moving), some funny instances, and some great acting.  But there was also a sacrifice of the important themes from the novel for the sake of \\"accuracy\\".  And even the accuracy was not that great as there are other, longer productions from 1974 and 1986 that better represent the book.  If you are simply dying to see what everyone's talking about perhaps you should rent this film.  But I have a feeling you will leave with little appreciation of Dickens' original tale.
B001R4MEYI|5.0|I must say, Mastodon is fast becoming my favourite band... i've been intrigued by this release even since i heard 'Divinations' and saw the trippy album cover. The album is quite exceptional... immediately sets itself apart from anything out there. Elements of prog rock/metal, psychedelia and sludge (to some extent) are dominant in most of the tracks. As 'out there' as the album is, Crack the skye is also Mastodon's most accessible work to date, compared to their previous releases. Practically every track on it is a winner, starting with Oblivion... the slow brooding intro leading into some 'Josh Homme' styled vocals from Brann Dailor. On another note, Brann Dailor is at the top of his game... he is a force to be reckoned with... hands down the most creative drummer i've heard in a long time. Brilliant work. The 10 min epic track 'The Czar, opens with a psychedelic twist and straps into high gear with its balls to the wall second part (around the 4 min mark). Great stuff. The title track is great as well with pounding, constant double bass from start to finish and a lingering chorus. With Crack the skye, Mastodon have arrived and are sure to take the throne of prog metal kings of this era.
0061689246|5.0|Stardust is a true classic in the best sense of the word. Gaiman combines elements of chivalry with both a plain world and a mystical backdrop. Using a turn of the century store as an introduction to the enamored heart of a small town boy feels like a page out of \\"Our Town\\". The exotic world of magic beckoning right beyond the wall makes us feel like we too could just as easily slip into another world.<br /><br />There is something dry about Gaiman's writing style in this book. Unlike Neverwhere - a wonderful book in it's own right - the characters here seem more accepting and dare I say less complex (maybe less modern) in viewpoint. Instead of dreading the next step they seem to naively push ahead just to see what may happen next. This allows the reader a chance to take a peak at the pure feelings of love, loss and growth as they happen. A lighter touch from one of the most complex current fantasy writers.
B00008DDSC|5.0|The amazing thing about this movie is that it blends the human desire for sexual passion with our ultimate desire to find a soul mate on this earth who can embrace our deepest selves even at our dirtiest core--and more importantly bring validity to it. Mr. Grey has a problem with sexual dominance that causes him to run through secretaries very quickly while Lee, who comes to work for him is a confused young woman with an affinity for self-induced pain.    Eventually the two learn of each other's socially unacceptable quirks and come to satisfy each other's needs, which were prior to unfulfilling and incomplete. The S&M between both Lee and Mr. Grey is by no means centered on pornography, which would separate sexual desire from intimacy and is used simply for the means of erotic pleasure but rather an intimate and unique bond that corny as it sounds completes both Lee and Mr. Grey.  This is why Lee must tell Mr. Grey that she loves him and wants to make love to him--her feelings for him are not just erotic but centered on a deep and complex bond that can only be founded in love.    The ending is one for the hopeless romantic where the heroine, Lee has saved Mr. Grey with her relentless loyalty and complete devotion bringing him back to life and melting his once removed and icy heart as he romantically carries her upstairs to a private love making lair.    This is definitely a unique movie that you'll never forget and will probably have a strange love affair with. Both men and women can find something in this movie but as you've probably guessed is for the older crowd.

B001TOD92C|4.0|\\"The Wrestler\\" is famously a comeback film for Mickey Rourke, whose lead performance earned him an Oscar nomination, about a battered, aging pro wrestler who dreams of a comeback.  Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), whose wrestling career peaked in the 1980s, now lives in a trailer park, stocks shelves at a grocery for a living, and competes in local wrestling matches on weekends. When a promoter suggests a rematch on the 20-year anniversary of one of The Ram's most famous fights, Randy thinks this might be his chance at a comeback. But his battered old body is crying out for retirement, not more abuse.<br /><br />Director Darren Aronofsky approaches this story with a cinema verite style. I could have done without so much camera movement, but the gritty style suits the subject. \\"The Wrestler\\" is a character study of a man who feels that there is only one place where he can do something that he's good at and be appreciated for it, but, unfortunately, his body can no longer cope with the injuries, the steroids, and general self-destruction of pro wrestling. The film conveys a respect for the athleticism and theater of pro wrestling, but, at the same time, serves as an expos&eacute; of the extreme physical abuse wrestlers inflict upon themselves. The fights aren't real, but the damage is.<br /><br />I'm not normally bothered by the depiction of violence on film. But people doing wanton violence to themselves for the entertainment of others is disturbing. It doesn't reflect well on wrestling fans. Though \\"The Wrestler\\" is about an aging wrestler's relationship to the sport, it touches on other relationships in his life. Randy finds a little companionship in a stripper named Cassidy (Marisa Tomei), also in danger of losing her livelihood to age. And he reaches out to his estranged daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood). I found Stephanie's histrionics unrealistic. But Mickey Rourke never overplays his characterization of a man who has one path at this point in his life, and it's not an enviable one. The Fox 2009 DVD has no bonus features.

B001RIY49C|4.0|No need to comment about the movie itself, we all know it is great.  I've also pre-ordered the Skynet edition and already have the Extreme Edition so don't need the discs either.  So why pay more than a hundred bucks for a plastic (I think) head?  Because (1) I really like the movie; (2) it is an instantly recognisable icon; (3) good conversation starter; and (4) it would make a great accent piece for my video collection.  Minus one star for the many T2 editions and price being on the high side.

B001IBIQU6|5.0|This album sounds really good! I was glad that DM went back to using the old school synth pop music. My favorite songs off this album are Wrong, A Hole To Feed, Peace, Miles Away/The Truth Is, Jezebel, Come Back, and Corrupt. I read the other negative reviews on this album and those people who wrote the negative reviews obviously have no taste in music. They're probably ones who think that Miley Cyrus, Britney Spears, and other popular radio music sounds good to them. I really hope that DM does finally win some Grammys for this album next year.
B00001U03Q|5.0|This is just the best cd from Eric Clapton i feel its not one with just few of his good songs it  is one that actually has all good songs.This is the cd anyone would enjoy.Thanks
B00007LTIA|5.0|TFTO was the first album i ever bought, with my first self earned money. I was 17 years old and it costed about 9,00 Euro which was a lot of money then. In fact i was a Uriah Heep fan and I should have bought Demons and Wizards instead, but i had that already on tape. A good friend advised me to go for Yes which was far better... So i bought the TFTO album and gave it a first listen.... I was quite disappointed and angry for so little rock value. It sounded more like a classical album to me. But every now and then i listened again (hey,... i did pay good money for it, didn't I?) and learned to appreciate it. In the music lessons at high school we learned about how non trivial music was composed and how one should sometimes listen analytically to appreciate properly. I discovered that this applied to TFTO and that listening to it is to be considered an adventure. With the years the album grew and unfolded to me and it became one of my classics and favourite Yes albums. It demonstrates the wide versatility and the artistic genious of Yes. When i listen to TFTO now, preferably on my Ipod, in the car or in audiophile conditions at home (alone) i see it as a treat. Yes it is a great album, but it is by no means trivial or easy listening
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|I know I'm one of those few that hates the version, but I'm having a front projector installed with a 2.40:1 screen, with motorized masking on the sides. I really kills the film, even only for a couple of scenes. I've been watching the on a 65\\" Panasonic plasma, and every time the IMAX scenes crop up, I really cringe. This film is excellent. I wish Christopher Nolan would re-release TDK on blu-ray, but without the changing aspect ratio. I hope that when my new front projector is installed the IMAX scenes will shrink in the 2.40:1 aspect ratio.
B00007KWHN|5.0|This is one of Yes's top albums with a lot of real classics. Tony Kaye is still playing with Yes, whence the jazzy turn, Steve Howe has already replaced Peter Banks and Bill Bruford is still drumming. In a sense this is a very strong Yes line up, almost a strong as the so called classic lineup with Wakeman or the ABWH line up, and the very strong compositions are there to prove it. This one, you value seekers, this one, is one to have and cherish. Enjoy
B000002UCN|3.0|Capitol-EMI did kind of give George's solo career a raw deal with this \\"best of\\" collection. But I think at that time George was taking a heavy beating (not deserved, BTW) for his \\"Dark Horse\\" and \\"Extra Texture\\" albums and wanted to make this more commercially palatable, apparently.  This album was nice because it did show neophytes that Harrison wrote some strong tunes with the Fabs, too, and wasn't just a preachy guy (his persona to a lot of misinformed people).  But now it is 2009 and FINALLY Capitol-EMI is putting out a career-spanning set called \\"Let It Roll: Songs By George Harrison\\" and an apparent sister set called \\"Let It Roll: The Best of George Harrison.\\"  I still am wondering why there are two titles, but they are both available right now at Amazon.  So -- don't waste your money on THIS album anymore. My advice: pre-order the new one right now! Besides, the album cover is wonderful (yeah, it's from his Beatles days, but it captures the impassioned musical spirit and \\"Inner Light\\" of the Dark Horse!)
B00007KWHO|5.0|This is one of the first Yes albums I discovered in 1973 after having bought Tales from Topographic Oceans. I kind of missed the early start of Yes as I was only 12 years old at the time. It is a very pleasant and adventureous album to listen to, still after all these years. It is a clearly Tony Kaye influenced album with a totally different style than the Rick Wakeman, Classicaly inspired, prog that came after the Yes Album when Tony left the group. I agree with the previous reviewers that this album is generally underrated, with no good reason just because for most fans Yes really starts at TYA or Close to the Edge.The first track is from Richie Havens but the Yes arrangement makes it something special. The same happened to the Stephen Stills track Everydays. All other tracks are mainly Yes compositions by Anderson or Anderson and Squire. For people used to the classical Yes sound (CTTE, Fragile, TFTO, Relayer,...) the more Jazzy feel needs adapting a bit.<br /><br />Anyway this is a very good example of the beautiful early British prog Rock that landmarks the genre ever since.

B000YXMMAO|5.0|...But I dont agree with the free downloading thing (pay what u like means i can do it for free). to make a music u must have talent. And people should pay for the talent. Thats where the respect comes from. And value. yes, if u pay this album a lot than th usual pay for the say Nickleback album. it'll make this more valuable.<br />And the talk about killing the induastry, i just dont buy it. we need record store. We need to stare at CD/LP without even have to buy it. record store is a cool place to hang out. To meet girls/guys. Sitting in front your PC and upload your fav music is just boring.<br />And we need cover album. Listening to music witohut holding the cover album in your hand just isnt complete. Cover album complete the music. its a part of it.<br />if thats the future of music, its dull.
B001CTDH4Y|4.0|For dog lovers and especially chihuahuas owners this is a delightful film.  The individuals doing the voiceovers are perfectly suited to the characters in the film.  I recommend it for both children and adults.

B001F2W4Y2|3.0|When I found out AC/DC was finaly releasing their new album in 2008 I was extreemly excited.  But what I didn't like was how this was supposed to be a Wal-mart exclusive album.  That to me is a big sell out move right there.  Didn't see the point of that.  I guess they feel they want to help Wal-mart's sells.  I found myself in a Wal-mart seeing AC/DC displays with all of thier cds and new t-shirts and this album with 3 different covers, red, and the limited edition white and yellow logos. Now onto the album itself.  Too much of my disapointment this is not the excellent, long awaited, in your face album we all wanted.  In fact I really like their previous effort, 2000's Stiff Upper Lip, much better then this.  The album starts off good with the lead single Rock N Roll Train which is probably the album's best song.  This song is as good to me as any classic AC/DC song.  Skies On Fire is the next one.  Another pretty good rocking song slower then the predecessor.  Big Jack comes in and it's nothing special.  Just seems like filler to me.  Anything Goes doesen't do too much.  Just sounds like the band is going through the motions. I won't do anymore track by track sections but I have heard this album quite a bit and can't really name another song that really grabbed me. The songs just sound bland to me with no real punch. I would think since it took them 8 years to make this album they would have worked harder and spent more time and effort on their songs.  It's worth having for the collection but it's not a classic.  This album ranks nowhere near the greatness of Back In Black, Highway To Hell, Powerage, or For Those About To Rock We Sallute You.  I would even take Flick Of The Switch over this which I thought was a great album.  It's definetly worth a listen but I consider this one in the league of weak albums like Blow Up Your Video, Fly On The Wall and Ballbreaker.
0439882826|5.0|Bought for my 7 yr old grandson who knows and has everything Star Wars. He was so excited to know he could now read and study in 3D his favorite series. A beautiful and well constructed book, that even astonished me with its quality.
3940004502|5.0|I must admit to being a dedicated fan of Chris Rea for many years and had not heard anything from this group at all.  I came across the collection purely by chance and decided to give it a try.  It has three Cd's and two vinyl albums.  Have not heard the vinyl as yet but the first of the three cd's is instrumental and takes you back to an earlier time in rock where the feel of the beat and the sound was all important.  It is fantastic.  The next two cd's are a variety of rocky and bluesy tracks which are equally as good.  On top of that you have the bonus of being able to read this very good quality book.  A very good collection from quality muso's.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is a great combination of SciFi with a bit of Western, a lot of humor, some love, seduction, and emotions, and a lot of good serious action as well.  It follows the adventures of captain Malcom Reynolds and those he chooses or allows for his crew on the ship Serenity.  Their varying roles and personalities intermix (and often collide) during their various \\"jobs\\" to create a wonderful series.      Some of the background and details within the show and of the characters seem to be elusive and the series doesn't have a proper conclusion either.  Many were sad to see the series end, because of this and because it was such an enjoyable show to watch!  The response to these issues was the creation of the movie Serenity.
0060736283|4.0|First of all, I must say this is the first of Coelho's books I've read. I found it to be enlightening, though not extremely action-packed, which is much more of my genre. This book maps out a spiritual journey taken by a man and his wife, and goes into detail about significant changes that have been made in their life.<br /><br />However, I have a problem with the numerous people criticizing Coelho's literary work on the grounds that it doesn't conform with their ideas of spirituality. I'm sure this was not written to be an accompaniment to the Bible, or a religious guide. If an author wants to express his ideas of spirituality, he should be entitled to do so without getting poor reviews just because the reviewers believe his ideas are WRONG.<br /><br />I personally thought this book was very thought-inducing. It gave you a lot to contemplate, and if you pause to consider how it relates to your life, you might be pleasantly surprised. I recommend it to anyone who would like to learn about , and possibly analyze, other perspectives to spirituality.
B000Q9IZ5C|4.0|Serenity is a sort of continuation, or perhaps finale, of the tv series Firefly, featuring the same crew characters who got to know each other while living in space together on a ship who's name gives us our title.  However, while Firefly focused more on captain Malcom Reynolds as the main character and the entire crew's interactions during various adventures, Serenity focuses more on the fugitive River Tam, explaining exactly why the government wants her back so badly.  The movie provides some closure to the series, with both happy and sad moments, but also gives details you were never able to find in Firefly.  The movie has less comedic aspects overall than the series, but that does not make it any less enjoyable.        Despite being in direct connection with the Firefly series, Serenity can still be enjoyed without having previously viewed any Firefly episodes.  It is a great SciFi movie with an interesting plot and a good amount of action.
B000CNE092|5.0|My recipient loved it!! Took her back to her childhood when she first fell in love with the movie.
B0010ZR160|3.0|First of all, the tried-and-true method of the main character narrating as the story goes along, just didn't work with Casey Affleck's nasally and whiny voice. Maybe it was because Ben Affleck directing his brother Casey, thought it would work. It was more annoying and distracting instead of adding to the movie.<br /><br />Michelle Monaghan didn't play a very important or effective part. Amy Ryan as Helene McCready, was perfect as the \\"doper\\" and irresponsible mother who got her child back. Ed Harris as Detective Remy Bressant, was very convincing as the main cop and co-conspirator of the kidnapping.  Morgan Freeman the mastermind and self-proclaimed \\"saviour\\" of the child of Helene McCready played a minor part until the very end.<br /><br />I'm glad this didn't turn out to be a movie that I'd need a calculator to rack up the body count. Although there was considerable amount of victims adding up (related and unrelated) after the initial kidnapping.<br /><br />And in the end, when Casey's character Patrick Kenzie has Morgan Freeman and the others arrested for kidnapping because \\"it was the right thing to do,\\" he himself goes \\"Scot-free\\" after murdering (read Executing) a child molester and killer that the cops helped coverup since he tried to save the life of a cop shot at the very same crime scene. This self-righteous ending just didn't play into the message he wanted to convey. Sure, no one was going to miss the child molester/killer, but his summary execution was in step with that old saying of \\"the lesser of two evils.\\" Pretty sour.<br /><br />Casey Affleck's tough-guy persona just didn't work in this movie. He just doesn't have that exterior gruff look or demeanor to portray a \\"bigger-than-life hero.\\"
1416914307|5.0|Read this series,you will love it!!!  The final book has a very satisfying ending,unlike some other series out there...  I'll admit at times I felt uncomfortable reading about \\"a brother and sister\\" kissing etc. etc.,but I kinda figured (and hoped and prayed)they would turn out not to be.  Checked the first one out from the library and after I finished it,I immediately ordered all three.  Finished the second one yesterday and the third one today.  Very engrossing story.  Five stars!!!
B000KF0NI4|4.0|This was a cute and sophisticated movie that ended way too soon. It was as enjoyable as Antz and A Bug's Life were in ye olden days of the '90's and is one further sign we are dwelling in, if not a golden age of animation, then surely something not far distant. The Ant Bully makes a nice addition to any animation-lover's video library (or is that a pass&eacute; term nowadays?) and Blu-ray is the format for which this film was made!
B000V1T87O|5.0|It starts as a comedy, but it turns into a tragic story. So beautiful, gripping...
B000000OYQ|4.0|When Jimmy Page disbanded The Firm late 1986 he started work on what would come to be Outrider. At first he had a double album in mind, each of the four sides covering rock, blues, acoustic, experimental. As it happened he unfortunately released it as a single album.<br /><br />With Jason Bonham on drums on seven of the nine tracks - the other two featuring Barrymore Barlow - he was definitely focused on the project, after all it was his first proper solo album. The Firm had been a disappointment and he had to show himself he could still produce great music. And that's what he managed to accomplish - Outrider is not a classic by a small measure of creativity.<br /><br />By using three singers - John Miles, Robert Plant & Chris Farlow - Jimmy brought versatility to the music, although ultimately this might've been its main flaw because it also created an inconsistency.<br /><br />The three instrumental tracks, on the other hand, sound great on their own and they are worthy of Jimmy. Also worthy of credit is the production which makes the music sound live and strong - far from the terribly dated productions of the day.<br /><br />So overall this is a great album that shouldn't be overlooked if you are a fan.

B001IBIQU6|5.0|&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60;&#60; OK, I felt the need to modify the title of my original review in which I called this album the &#34;2nd Best Depeche Mode Album After Violator&#34;.  I still love it but wouldn't rank it quite so high, hence the title change &#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;&#62;  In order to appreciate this fine album you need to listen to the official version of this release and hear it a couple of times to formulate a valid assessment of this album.  Otherwise, you'll be roped into the following WRONGS:  1  The songs have no hooks  WRONG.  After repeated listens, it becomes evident that this is a very musical, melodic album with some of the strongest vocal and instrumental arrangements ever delivered by the band. Songs like 'Peace' and 'Wrong' are among the most catchy and melodic songs anywhere. Period.  2  The songs are weak  WRONG.  These are some of the best songs the band has ever written.  Martin Gore stated that they never record the same album twice.  This one is quite unlike the last one.  If anything, it shares kinship with the band's earlier works. I believe the band deliberately created songs that transcend simplistic arrangements which contribute to their gradual and lasting appeal.  3  They should just give up  WRONG.  Playing the Angel and Sounds of the Universe are two of the best albums that Depeche Mode has recorded.  The band is enjoying a resurgence of popularity on the strength of their last release and this once should build on their fan base.  Could this be the album that propels them to the Rock'n'Roll hall of fame? Time will tell.  4  There are no immediately accessible songs like 'Precious'  WRONG.  The first single Wrong is a very catchy first number, the 'Personal Jesus' of this album.  'Hole to Feed', 'Peace', 'Perfect', 'Fragile Tension' and 'Corrupt' are all solid choices for singles.  I will go so further as to say that there is no bad song on this album.  The opening track, 'In Chains' is a terrific preamble to the album and has a strong Tears for Fears vibe. I love the catchy chorus of 'In Sympathy', but it was 'Little Soul' that glued me to this album. I love the walk-softly-but-carry-a-big-stick lyric of &#34;my soul will leave a footprint&#34;.  Even the bonus songs are great and could easily have been included on the album, particularly 'Ghost' and 'Light'.  5  The production is weak  WRONG.  The album is tightly produced and has a different feel than their last one.  Overall, the production is crisp and the themed atmospherics create a lush soundscape which envelops the listener.  The arrangements are superb with the possible exception of &#34;Come Back&#34; which may have been produced beyond what was required. Some may prefer the rougher mix but I think the stripped down studio sessions version is what should have survived the final cut.  Whether it was the band's doing or the producer's, no one can say.  After &#34;righting&#34; these wrongs, I proclaim the brilliance of this incredible album that gets better with each listen and I've been listening to it continually since its release.  It's as good as if not better than Playing the Angel which I still think is one of their best albums ever.  I really like the existential, cosmic theme that runs through the songs and the lyrics. Despite the cynicism of the first single 'Wrong', I found it oddly relevant in light of my own recent experiences. In stark contract, the over-the-top positivity of 'Peace' is sheer delight, quite possibly the most optimistic song in the Depeche Mode songbook.  Gotta love that synth!  So do yourself a favor by taking the time to listen to the album. You'll find some great reward!  Peace
B0013FNC38|5.0|For some \\"old folks\\", we really enjoy this CD .. found Mraz on YouTube when my wife's students (middle school) showed her some of their fave music.  So, we've enjoyed his music a great deal, talented artist, good lyrics, great tunes.  After being married for 37 years, our fave is, of course, \\"Lucky\\"!  But they are all great tunes!
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I first learned of Playing For Change when the originator of this brilliant concept was interviewed on Bill Moyers' program several months ago.  Two of the songs on this CD were played at that time and I was in love!  Now the CD + DVD have been released.  I've been able to hear and watch several of the other recorded tracks and been moved and inspired by each.  It's a technological marvel with musicians from around the world blending their voices and instruments without ever being together.  I have never been more moved or inspired!  The musicians, from street players to some who seem to have been classically trained, blend in perfect harmonies and allow me to believe that it is possible that all people could do the same; if we just get together we can feel all right!  But if that concept doesn't interest you, just listen for the wonderful music.  Peace.
1932100660|4.0|Whole-food diet   The book recommends a diet of essentially 100 % whole plant foods. All respected nutritionists outside the food processing industry would not disagree that it is safest to eat 100% natural whole-foods ie foods which have not been industrialised (eg corn-fed beef), fractionated (eg the myriad of foods constructed from extracts of corn, wheat and soy), contaminated (with numerous chemicals) or otherwise processed (eg homogenised milk). However there is no consensus that all the foods should be plant foods.     Animal Protein (Chapter 3)   Campbell reports that if aflatoxin poisoned rats are given too much casein they develop cancer. Casein is a fractionated food, derived presumably from modern industrialised cow's milk and something that humans do and should not eat on it's own - one wonders what would have happened if the rats had been given natural whole milk with is fat, other proteins, vitamins and enzymes (if not pasteurised) etc needed for proper digestion intact ? What would have happened if there were given similarly excessive amounts of other fractionated foods such as fructose extracted from otherwise healthy fruit ? - diabetic symptoms ??   Though dairy foods are modern food in evolutionary terms, humans have used them successfully for thousands of years.   From these experiments on HIGH LEVELS of FRACTIONATED, DAIRY foods on RATS, and one or two other experiments which he did not describe, Campbell goes on to conclude that ALL WHOLE ANIMAL FLESH foods (fish , poultry and meat and eggs) are dangerous to HUMAN health in ANY QUANTITY. This is in spite of the evidence that hunter gatherers survived for hundreds of thousands of years eating large amounts of animal foods of all types and that even some modern civilisations have survived perfectly healthily on all animal food diets. Today, many civilisations outside the western developed world live very healthily while consuming animal foods in substantial quantities (eg Japanese, one of the healthiest nations in the world eat substantial amounts of fish).     Nutrients (Chart 11.2)   No nutritionist would disagree that humans need to eat nutritious foods, as natural as possible with sufficiently high levels of vitamins, minerals and other organic nutrients. Table 11.2 focuses on those nutrients which are better obtained from plant foods. However many other nutrients vital, important or beneficial to human health are better obtained from animal foods because they are not available in plant foods or the amounts available in plant foods are much lower- these include vitamins B12, B2 and B3 and D, minerals such as zinc and selenium, long chain omega 3 fatty acids, carnitine, creatine, carnosine, taurine and coenzyme Q10. If one adopts a vegan diet it can be difficult or impossible to obtain all these in good quantities without using dietary supplements.     Western Diet (Charts 4.7, 4.8, 8.4,14.3)     In industrialised western societies, most of the food eaten is industrialised food rather than whole food. Animals are fed unnaturally and both plant and animal foods are fractionated. The resultant processed foods are loaded with processed fat, refined sugar and starch and modified animal and plant proteins and are low in essential nutrients. In the above mentioned charts, the industrialised western societies have highest incidence of disease - the most obvious association is with the industrialisation of food as the amount of truly natural whole animal and plant foods eaten is rather low in these countries. Primitive societies which do not use industrialised foods seem to do better.     Conclusion   From an ideological point of view it would be nice to believe that one could thrive on an entirely vegan whole-food diet - however this seems to be very risky as it defies the whole history of human evolution for hundreds of thousands of years. The biggest risk to human health seems to be the industrialisation of food production rather than consumption of natural animal food. Four out of five stars are given because it could be optimum for 80%, possibly 90%, of food to be whole plant food with 20%, or certainly 10 %, whole animal food (fish from the sea, true free range poultry and eggs, grass fed red meat and even some milk and butter from grass fed cows, not margarine).
B001UREJWM|4.0|With three members over 60 yrs of age (RJD is 66!) this is not your grampa's jug band.  Heaven & Hell's (also known as Black Sabbath with Dio in a former life) 'The Devil You Know' is HEAVY Metal done right.  Crunching riffs (a la guitar legend Tony Iommi) and rhythms (provided by the team of bass virtuoso Geezer Butler and thundering drummer Vinny Appice) provide the power of the album, topped off with vocals from hell itself (Ronnie James Dio surely doesn't sound 66).  If you dig heavy lumbering metal this is an album for you.  Too soon to tell how this release by the boys will stand up to the other releases from this lineup ([[ASIN:B000009FGB Mob Rules]] and [[ASIN:B000002LUB Dehumanizer]]), but on initial listens this reviewer would say it's right in the mix.  Dehumanizer wasn't `accepted' as a great album when it was released over a decade ago, but is thought by most now as a really solid set of songs.  'The Devil You Know' is already at that point on release day, so with time it's only likely to be even more well received.  Tony, Ronnie, Geezer and Vinny have matured a lot and it shows on this record.  The production value is extremely good - everyone's musicianship is on show.  Several stand out songs like the initial single release \\"Bible Black\\", \\"Follow the Tears\\" and \\"The Turn of the Screw\\".  Generally solid from start to finish, 4 stars.
B001TOD92C|3.0|I love the old 1980s-style wrestling that this movie depicts, and was looking forward to viewing it. Mickey Rourke was excellent, no question, as were just about all the actors. And the first half of the film had a lot going for it, as we see Randy \\"the Ram\\" Robinson try to get by 20 years after his career peaked. Up until the scene where Randy takes part in a modern-style \\"hardcore\\" match that's too much for his old body, the film is actually pretty good. To explain how it all goes downhill in the second half would require lots of spoilers; suffice it to say that it turns into a maudlin, sentimental Hallmark-TV-movie story, with a hokey \\"redeeming\\" finish that even Hulk Hogan or the Ultimate Warrior wouldn't have tried to get away with.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|I am hooked on this show. It is so raw and realistic. I wish it was on earlier because i have to get up early the next day.Can't wait for season 2 to be for sale.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|Halestorm is a great band and this album could be the best rock release of 2009!  Lzzy (vocals/guitar) will blow any current artist out of the building, especially good to watch live (acapella breakdowns and drum circles).  The album is quite diverse really and after a few listens you can see how just about any song could be released as a single.  My personal faves are: \\"Familiar Taste of Poison\\", \\"It's Not You\\", \\"I Get Off\\" & \\"Nothing to do with Love\\".  It's loud, fun, and bit angry.  Pick it up, you won't be disappointed.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I prefer outdoor activites versus a gym or workout video because I hate working out and I don't like doing any kind of workout that requires me to memorize a bunch of choreography or spend more than 30 minutes in front of the TV. I don't have the time or patience for it.  So if you are anything like what I describe above this DVD is for you. Its short, easy to follow and it works! The workout is only 20 minutes! Even I can find 20 minutes a day to work out. Jillian doesn't mess around or waste my time by sugar coating the workout. She gives you an intense 20 minutes that works-you-out! The first day I did it I really felt like I was going to die. I like that she offers 3 levels of intensity so on days when I'm not feeling so motivated I do the beginner series and other days I'll do the more advanced workout or the beginner without modifications.     Jillian is great - she's not too peppy or chatty and gives excellent instuction on form and movement. I find her very motivating.     And the best part - it works! I've been doing the workout 3-5 days a week for a month and have definition in my arms and have lost inches in my stomach and hips.
0385340990|5.0|While I could hardly put this book down once I started it, I never wanted it to end.  It made me laugh out loud and it made me weep on more than several occasions.  The characters are so utterly loveable, I found myself thinking of them when I wasn't nose-deep in the book, and telling my husband about the latest happenings in Guernsey, gossiping like they were our neighbors (though I'm not normally one to gossip!).  :)  The way it is written in the form of letters makes it feel very real, especially being set in the historical backdrop of post-WWII.  It is at times painful to read, but overall it is a beautiful story of friendship, courage and love.  I highly recommend this book.  Definitely one of my all-time favorites.
B0000DIJO2|5.0|I was skeptical of buying this, as I thought I was \\"all knowing\\" about The Bee Gees, being a 70's & 80's music FANATIC!  But, was I wrong!  This is by far the best music purchase I have EVER made.  I have watched it time and time again!
B0001JXQEM|5.0|This CD Double makes an excellent gift.  I gave it to my freind who turned 29.  He liked it a lot.  It is a great in sight into Weezer.
B00004RF97|5.0|Always wondered where High Society,the Movie, came from. All is revealed.   Think Grant & Hepburn were sensational. Having seen High Society first, have to say Sinatra & Holm were a better team than Stewart & what's her name; and Sinatra did a much better job on Grace Kelly than Stewart did on Hepburn! This Movie was good value tho'.
B001PPGAIA|4.0|The movie is almost 3 hours, and is definitely made to be like the epics of old. Unfortunately, it ends up more like the kitchen sink, with the director trying to do too much at once, with a who's who of Australian cinema that also does the same. The first part is farce, the second part melodrama, the third action film and the fourth war film.      Jackman is great, Kidman does well but overwrought, she always seems buttoned up anyway. We don't get to see much of the 'happy 2 years' til the war comes, so her whole 'you can't let the kid go walkabout' and scene where he goes to mission island lacks context.    The motiveless malevolence of David Wenham, especially towards his own son, just seemed over the top. As does letting him get away with 2 murders-were they really that backward in the 1940s, even in the outback?    Some of the material almost seemed Victorian!    And what about the cattle drive=we never even get to see the suffering of the most difficult part of the whole journey!    A worthy effort, worth seeing for Jackman and the scenery alone.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been battling these last ten pounds for about 2 years, and I have tried everything out there - classes, trainers, diets and every video under the sun.  I couldn't find anything to get past this plateau, but I can tell you now: circuit training! circuit training! Jillian does more with these 20 minutes than some of the other videos I had that would take me over an hour.  I use 8 lb weights through the whole thing, but if they get too difficult, I just lighten the weight.  As far as the workouts go, I didn't exactly follow the instructions to a tee. I rotated levels 1, 2 and 3 daily and if a workout in level 3 was too hard, I just did the modified form.  And, if I felt very ambitious, I would skip the cooldown for that workout and tack on circuit 1 from another level workout and its cooldown to make it more of a 40 minute workout.  If anyone is looking for another dvd with a style like this one, the firms's \\"get chisel'd\\" is very similar to this.  It's as intense as this one, just in a different way.  All in all, this is a great workout.  Talk about getting your money and time's worth.  I'm one of those people who if I'm giving you an hour to work me out, I want to get every second's worth.  I highly recommend shopping around for other videos because I can tell you from experience: being bored and plateauing is no fun.
0515123447|5.0|I have often longed for the perfect action movie, and action novel. Somehow the main characters always feel soft to me and leave me desiring something more. To be honest I want a brutal main character who can be extremely violent, but also isn't a total wimp when a woman comes into the picture. For me Taken is the epitome of my perfect action movie. The Killing Floor is my perfect action novel. I've been hesitant to read Child's series because it's a commitment to read 12 books (although I'll skip Nothing to Lose)...choosing to read around this novel. I enjoyed Eisler's John Rain, but Jack Reacher would break his liberal neck and Child would continue his reign as one of (and for me THE) best fiction writers out there. Good show. HIGHLY recommended.
B001TH16DI|2.0|Paramount is just trying to cash in on the release of the new Star Trek movie! If the movies are still going to remain 480 they will look grainy anyway at 1080! They should have done this right and taken the time and effort, but who's saying they won't later on and we trek fans will buy them all the same. It's our lot in life.
B000E5KUK6|4.0|I can understand the hatred for this film, giving that they took one of the most powerful monsters to ever grace the big screens and turned him into a giant bag of lizardy cowardice. Ok, the wuss factor was upped from 0-10 on Godzilla's part. That was a mistake. We all agree.    Or have we also considered that after decades of films starring a grossly UN-dinosaurian lump of scales (rather a guy in a rubber suit) stomping rather un-convincingly around miniature sets, all the while reminding us of how unrealistic he is, especially as no theropod dinosaurs had plates on their back, and none stood fully erect and dragged their tail, or had dumpy fat legs and a pot belly... HAVE we considered... that it was inevitable that Godzilla be re-envisioned for the modern audience?    No, he shouldn't be a big Iguana- but the design WAS, you have to admit, superior to the lumbering, jiggling mass of latex in the japanese films who for some reason couldn't stop wiggling his arms and making movements that no animal would ever find it necessary to make (who stands there and flails their arms for three minutes and roars while swaying from side to side?).    The HEART of the symbolism was still intact, with him being the product of nuclear technology, but lost it's way before the first act was through.    I think most of us can agree that an exploration of a more realistic godzilla WAS something that needed to be done- though we may not LIKE the outcome, someone somewhere along the line was going to pose the question: \\"What if Godzilla were real? How would a theropod build look in movement? If a 300 foot lizard were stomping around, why would it be immune to powerful military weaponry? If Godzilla were a real creature, what would it DO, stomp around and breath fire, or look for what we all do- food and shelter?\\" Size alone wont save you from missiles, nor will thick skin.    That's not to say that they couldn't have at least made him more imposing and given him his regeneration abilities, which would GREATLY increase the amount of missile strikes he could sustain, even as a 'real' animal.  On the bright side, the egg that hatched at the end, in the animated series, turns out to become a much stronger Godzilla who CAN use his nuclear breath (which, by the way, he DID use in the movie, just wasn't nearly as powerful OR explained as to how it functions biologically, but then if Godzilla were chasing me, I don't think I'd be asking questions ).  So, in summary:  Pros:  **A servicable cast, better actors than most Toho films save the original 1954 Gojira. Jean reno is always a good thing.  **FAR more convincing as a creature than a man in a rubber suit will ever be thanks to great special effects- some of the best CG creature work of the 90's next to Jurassic park/Dragonheart, not to mention behaviorally and locomotion for a large biped.  **Has the guts to re-imagine Godzilla while at least TRYING to pay homage to the originals at times.  **A memorable entrance, though I wish he had the grand walking-out-of-the-ocean entrance**    Cons:   **Though he LOOKs a heck of a lot better than the Japanese suits (no offense to the classics, love them, but by better I mean more REAL and functional as a life form), this Godzilla is a pale imitation of the power of the original, who would often walk into a hail of missiles and bombs to virtually no effect- this one is killed by two rounds of missiles.  **Nobody outside of the entrance scene seems remotely intimidated by Godzilla.  There should be mass panic and chaos throughout the film with the military's best efforts being in vain.  A little odd, a Godzilla that RUNS AWAY FROM THE ARMY.  **Sort of insults Japan by ignoring Godzilla's relationship with the country for the most part (sinking a japanese fishing ship aside) and his origins FROM there (he should have landed at Tokyo first THEN maybe New York).  Kudos for throwing in 'It's GOJIRA you moron', though!    Overall, a pretty good MONSTER movie. As a GODZILLA movie, it drops a load of bricks on it's own foot. BUT, if you are WILLING to ALLOW Godzilla to be re-imagined as a real animal grounded in physics (ignoring the one problem, being that we don't think a 300 foot tall biped would be structurally possible, but then 50 years ago we didn't think a 190 foot, 200 ton Dinosaur like Amphicoelias was possible either)... IF you are willing to let it be it's OWN Godzilla, it's own VERSION of it, it's actually enjoyable.
B000244FDW|5.0|As a Jane Austen aficionado, I inevitably judge movie adaptions of her books by how faithfully the movie follows her script.  PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is one of the most frequently adapted of her works, but while most begin well frequently time constraints cause the director to compress and change frantically in the middle or the end until what one has is a travesty rather than an adaption.  The lovely thing about this BBC adaption is that time is taken.  The plot proceeds, by and large, as Jane wrote it, with letters being written and read in the voice of the character who wrote them with the recipient reacting for the camera.  This causes the action to unfold in a way that matches my visualization when I read the book. I did note the omission of one scene near the end. The scene where Elizabeth has to convince her father that she has changed her mind about Darcy has sadly been omitted, but this is the only major scene from the book that does not occur in this adaption.<br /><br />Another match for my fictional reverie is the way the cast so completely inhabit their roles.  David Rintoul may not be the most passionate Darcy, but his striking appearance and stately air match my impression of this character.  Elizabeth Garvie is a lively, witty Elizabeth Bennett complete to the sparkling eyes. All the other characters are well done: Mr. Collins, Bingley, and the Bennett sisters.  No one performance here is the best ever done, but the acting here is exact and splendid with no weaknesses.<br /><br />Some small liberties have been taken; I find them entertaining and allowable because they are small.  This lush BBC production is highly recommended if one has the time to enjoy all five episodes!
0316067598|5.0|I can not see how anyone would not like this book except the liberals and liberal media. Marcus does not speak too highly of them and rightfully so. Marcus tells of the actual accounts of war and of a heroic battle from a special forces point of view. Noone likes war but it's an unfortunate reality of mankind. Some people just can not accept this fact and are in denial. So we have Americans that hate our soldiers and our country eventhough it was people like Marcus that gave you the right to be free. These are the ones that rated this book a low rating. How arrogant and hypocritial. For those folks please just open your mouths and say, \\"Baaaaaaa\\".
B0007OY2P8|4.0|If PRIDE AND PREJUDICE is the most dramatized of the Jane Austen novels, NORTHANGER ABBEY is probably the least.  This is the story of young Catherine Morland, who leaves her rustic country home for the cosmopolitan tourist town of Bath under the protection of her family friend, Mrs Allen.  Miss Morland, a great novel reader, is especially fond of gothic thrillers (and would today probably be a great fan of the TWILIGHT series).<br /><br />Katharine Schlesinger is perfect as the innocent, wide-eyed Miss Morland and I loved the movie's poetic device of showing us her romantic and slightly creepy reveries.  The rest of the cast was also superb, including the witty Henry Tilney.<br /><br />This edition gets a little too fluffy by not depicting the economic circumstances of the people involved.  It glosses over the fact that both Miss Morland's father and Henry Tilney are clergymen, albeit on opposite ends of the economic spectrum.  It plays fast and loose with the character of General Tilney, inventing a weird Frenchwoman companion and endowing him with gambling debts in defiance of Jane Austen's depiction of him as a very stern and proper father.  Such divergence from the \\"sacred texts\\" forces me to knock off a star.<br /><br />However, this movie shines in the portrayal of the main theme: the need to keep fact and fiction in their proper spheres.  For fun, romance and a gentle but effective spoof of a type of literature that never completely goes out of style, I heartily recommend this movie edition of NORTHANGER ABBEY!
B000GDH9JQ|5.0|Fabulous movie---I wasn't certain that I'd be able to find the DVD since it's an older movie.
B001MEJY8W|1.0|i love Movies from other country's,i never watch american movies anymore.i waited for Martyrs for 2 months,i bought it today,watched it,i was very disappointed.not very violent,nothing to disturbing,just a Blah type movie,maybe i didnt enjoy Martyrs cause i am Desinsitized (SP)?? nothing is disturbing to me anymore. also stay away from (Frontiers) *Blah* of a movie.  i dont mean to be so mean but eh...
0920668364|5.0|This is a great book, one that you will read aloud over and over to your children (hopefully while you are rocking them!) It is timeless, and crosses all generations. I highly recommend it as a gift to all expectant and new parents!
B000J3OTTQ|5.0|this is one of my all time favorite movies and I love Channing Tatum's role in this movie!  Outstanding!
B001SGEUNI|5.0|We saw these guys with Saliva and Shinedown and they were totally playing at their level. Amazing band, awesome sound, great lyrics. Comparable to Hinder, the good Nickelback, Flyleaf and Amy Lee. Totally original sound though. Buy one for your friends, these guys need to stay around!
B001MEJY8W|5.0|This is an amazing gem of a film. I had heard alot of hype about this movie for almost a year before actually being able to see it, and it definately lived up to all the hype and more! Very intense, fast paced, and ultra violent. If you love films like High Tension, Inside, or Frontiers then this is a must see, simply a continuation of the new french horror legacy.
B000022TSH|5.0|This is one of my favorite Polanski films, which is saying a lot.  Unlike the two-dimensional characters that you get in the FN genre, these characters are realistic, troubled, and flawed.  Nicolson is the best:  a PI because he had to leave the police force, he is deeply angry and cynical.  But in his heart, he does want to help.  He is skilled as an investigator and smart, but gets in way over his head.  Dunaway, the femme fatale who is the only person with a clear idea of diong good, also defies simple labels.  Their performances are amongst the finest of their careers, so good they have to been seen and savored more than once.  Huston is also good as a sleazeball, but even he adds aspects to the character that make the role unforgettable.<br /><br />This is one of the films that is so interesting and moving you can watch it at each phase of your life and find nuance you missed.  Recommended with the greatest enthusiasm.
B001PPLIEQ|1.0|Frankly, it's a dead loss. Lots of action, but very disjointed plot. Hard to follow.
B001L5SXQG|4.0|I am quite enjoying this album.  It's a great selection of songs.  My favorite is \\"Queen of the Supermarket.\\"<br /><br />The tour supporting this album is awesome.  Go see it when it comes to your city if you can!
B001RTP3Z0|5.0|If you like \\"folk\\" music, poetry or pure relaxing entertainmet,\\"Live IN London\\" may be the best concert albumn or video ever produced. Cohen is the premier poet-musician of our time. Although his music is not as diverse as Dylan, even in spoken word it is stunning. My only criticism  is that he tends to hold the mic in front of his mouth in the camera angle used.
B001E5FYS8|1.0|This movie and the accompanying cartoon set out to show the amazing achievement of a brilliant artist and thereby give us peons some beauty and genius in our sad little grey lives.  Oh how we should thank people like Petit for what they bring to the world.  Bah! Humbug!<br /><br />What did Petit do.  He strung 450 pounds of cabling across the towers, and walked across it with a 55 pound balance bar.  The cabling almost fell off the roof at night.  How much damage could 450 pounds of 3/4 inch steel cable do to a pedestrian after falling 450 meters (1/4) miles? or the balance pole? or Petit himself?  The film maker never asked Petit what he thought of the risk that his stunt posed to others.  Why?  It seems like a pretty fundamental question: \\"Why were you willing to possibly kill innocent people for your beliefs?\\"  Were the terrorists that knocked the buildings down artists as well?  Merely by doing the stunt he shows his complete dis-regard for the safety of others.  Imagine if your wife or daughter or husband or son died because some egomaniac was stringing up 450 pound of cable on one of the tallest buildings in the world.  His walk wouldn't be nearly so magical then would it?<br /><br />It is tiresome listening to Petit and his dupes wax on and on about how beautiful and magnificent and artistic his walk was.  I'm sorry, but tightrope walking is a novelty, barely above a joke.  It's like juggling or unicycle riding or competitive Yo-Yoing.  You know something you might look at for 5 minutes, think 'that's different' and then totally forget about.  So I don't know why doing it between the two towers is such an achievement.  Because he risked his life?  Well then lets venerate Russian roulette and car surfing as wonderful artistic activities.  And if public safety doesn't matter, then let's all praise the artistry of street racers and terrorist plane hijackers.<br /><br />No, this movie missed the boat.  The real subject here is not the act itself and it's artistry, but rather Petit's psychology and the psychology of the people that followed him.  Narcissists are nothing new.  Their charm and grandiose self-aggrandizement and insatiable need for adulation and acclaim suck people in, including those who rave about this guy.<br /><br />Leaving aside the fact that he put other's lives in danger, he did hurt people.  Once he got famous he dropped the people who helped him, slept with the first groupie, and told his GF bye-bye.  One guy in the movie cry when he thought about the end of the relationship even though it was 33 years after the fact.  So he pretty much used people as long as they were useful and then he's done with them.  Typical narcissistic using behaviour.  Others are seen as tools and when your done with them, well who cares.<br /><br />Anyway, the fact that there are legions of people willing lionize such a pathetic attention seeking megalomaniacal user as Petit says to me that we as a society are pretty ignorant of narcissism.  And as such, those with that kind of personality will have plenty of willing fodder for their morally bereft grandiosities.  There will be more Bernard Madoffs, no doubt.chology and the psychology of the people that followed him.  Narcissists are nothing new.

B001IAOEXU|3.0|I wanted to like them alot, honestly. I am a FPS freak and play games from killzone 2 to uncharted. I had heard that they made the controller more comfortable to be using R2 and L2 as the triggers, but it ends up feeling somewhat awkward and too spaced out to be using them as that. Theyr'e amazing in racing games, using R2 as boost/gas however.<br />Don't view these triggers as substitutes for the R1 and L1 button, but more as a great addition to your controller and feel more comfortable when using it to crouch/throw grenade.
B00001U0DP|5.0|This movie would easily fall into my top twenty favorite films. It has romance, comedy, and tragedy rolled up into one. It has subtitles, but it is well worth the watch.
0316044695|5.0|Loved the book!  It is amazing the training of our special forces.  This book made me proud to be an American and proud of all the men and women serving this country.  This is a must read for every person in the United States.
B000W7JWUA|4.0|This is one of those family games that once you have played it you will love it but hardly no one outside of hardcore board game enthusiast has ever played it, but once they do they fall in love with it.    Instead of playing Monopoly for the 1000th time I highly suggest buying this game it is easy to learn,fun to play and every game is different.Anyone can learn to play it very quickly and it is a total blast to play with friends and family it has become a staple at game nights.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I was skeptical at first how a DVD could make a difference, but let me tell you it had!! I have been doing this for about 2 months now, 3-4 days a week and I have lost over 20 pounds! (combined with longer cardio workouts and eating well )I am seeing muscle definition in my arms and legs I have never gotten from working out on my own. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to lose weight and tone up!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I decided to get this because of other positive reviews I read.  I am not in shape at all and wanted something that would inspire me to workout and eventually get fit.  I have used DVD for one week now, and already I have noticed an improvement to my stamina and strength.  I have increased energy and sleep better at night.  This workout is tough and does make you sweat.  My husband even has started using it in addition to his daily workout routine.  It has three different workouts at different intensity levels, which is good for me.  I get easily bored with the same thing.  Jillian times her comments right during the workout.  Just when you feel like stopping, she chimes in and inspires you not to.  I'm am usually cynical when it comes to workout and dieting gimmicks, but I do believe in this product.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I am totally scared of vampires, but as part of my 12 step program to become the greatest human being in my town, I had to watch Twilight. I nearly had a poop in me britches because I was so scared. Vampires look like people, but when the moon comes out they have fangs and bite people like that little rotweiler puppy in my cove. But instead of just biting you, they want blood!! I'm not even kidding about that!    So I sat through the movie with my blanket and Captain Safeguard(my five foot tall stuffed Manatee). I made it through the whole thing. As I was watching the film and eating some corn on the cob, I was grabbed by the soundtrack. There was some good music being played in this film. The song by paramore rocked and the Full Moon song was kicking like some of the best stuff Michael Bolton has done. Can you imagine Michael Bolton as a vampire? I know!!! Whenever they say Full Moon I expect vampires to try to get me. It's one of those songs that keeps me on the edge. Who am I kidding, I live on the edge. I front the best thrash polka cover band in eastern Nebraska. I'm going to rename my street the edge because I can.     So if you totally want to be scared and hear some scary music, buy this soundtrack.
B000068FXR|5.0|Why can't there be music like this still being made?  It has everything that I look for whenever searching for something to listen to.  I was delighted to hear such good songs from a lesser known Supertramp album.  This band is truly underated.  I love every song on this and all of their albums.  They are complex muscial arrangements that at the same time have a simple theme that is moving and have the potential to be life changing.  At the very least Supertramp is a super band.  I can't over emphasize how important it is that everyone hear what they have to say.
B001PA0FFO|5.0|Did he or didn't he?     When Father Flynn (Phillip Seymour Hoffman) takes an interest in the only Black boy in school, Donald Miller (Joseph Foster) the Principal Sister Aloysius (Meryl Streep) makes accusations of impropriety.    The Father has an explanation. Donald, an altar boy, was caught drinking sacramental wine. The kid's troubled, his father beats him, and he needs help.  Sister Aloysius doesn't buy it--well, in truth, she doesn't seem capable of giving any kind of warm fuzzy support to her students or her staff.     \\"Leave my son out of this.  My husband will kill my son over one thing like this...\\" his mother (Viola Davis) begs. She wants her son in Catholic School until June so he can get into a good high school and she's not questioning the motives of someone who's been kind to her son when so few others have been. You see, Mrs. Miller believes her son is 'different' and that's the nature God gave him.     Sister James (Amy Adams), a new nun, doesn't believe Father Flynn did anything wrong. She can't sleep after the accusations.      \\"Doubt\\" is a powerful drama about human nature and tolerance. Father Flynn is not the kind of Catholic Sister Aloysius is--his fingernails are too long, he drinks three sugars in his tea, he wants secular music in the Christmas pageant, and he's openly affectionate to the students...Does that make him inappropriate or wrong?  So--did Father Flynn take liberties with Donald or didn't he?  Watch the film.  Decide for yourself. Perhaps you will have doubts....    Rebecca Kyle, April 2009
0393327345|3.0|FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO JUST WANT THE BOTTOM LINE ON THIS BOOK, READ THE LAST PARAGRAPH OF THIS REVIEW.    Let's just be completely clear: This is a review of the NOVEL Fight Club. I'll mention the movie some, but this is only about Chuck Palahniuk's original creation.    To quickly put to rest a few of the quotes on the back of the book and elsewhere:  To call this \\"overly violent\\", \\"gory\\", \\"utterly original\\", OR \\"diabolically sharp\\" is to call Beethoven a decent piano player but criticize his basketball skills. That is to say, it's not only stupid, it's WAY off.    Chuck Palahniuk (I'm just calling him Chuck from here on out, ok?) does have a grip on the apathetic pulse of America's underbelly and general loser culture. That is made clear throughout the \\"utterly original\\" anti-space monkey culture plot. Chuck's problems start when he limits himself to safe taboo-breaking. Yes, there is such a thing. If Chuck truly aims to offend or to be brutally honest about a no-no subject, say that women enjoy rape and justify it somehow. That'll get my attention, get me offended, and it would be original. Saying that we are held hostage by our jobs and our pathetic, meaningless lives is about as original as saying the phrase \\"that's original\\" in a book review.    To the people who say that this is \\"edgy\\" or makes them uncomfortable: Spare me. Quit saying that. I'll make you a homework assignment if you keep it up. I'll keep tabs on you, make sure you're improving (the only way I don't sound like I'm high just now is if you've read the book already or seen the movie).    Fight Club reads like a novel that could be much, much better if put through extensive editing and a few plot revisions. The entire first 100 pages are difficult to read; the staccato, half-awake writing style takes some getting used to before if becomes effectively concise, which, I assume, was Chuck's goal - to write concisely. Since this is a surreal story with heavy nihilistic themes, the writing HAS to be vague and unspecific or else the reader will either quickly dissect the characters and see their uninteresting simplicity, or the reader will become annoyed with the inevitably predictable plot.    Chuck IS able to squeeze some interesting and quality lines from an old and tired philosophy (the Fight Club rules are somewhat nice, as are Project Mayhem's. \\"The liberator who destroys my property is fighting to save my spirit.\\" [pg. 110] was one of Tyler's more enjoyable lines. Its meaning is explained more in context.).    The character of Tyler Durden is an engaging, charismatic, and nihilistic individual who drives the entire novel. Fight Club would have been a complete bore and cliché-fest if not for Tyler. While Tyler is the genesis of most of the novel's unnecessary attempts at humor that come off as just gross or juvenile (most of the time anyway), he is almost the hot-spot for the novel's key themes and lines of dialogue.      Fight Club has been advertised as an edgy, highly original thriller that will grab your attention all the way through. In reality, it's a juvenile, sporadically original attempt at a thriller that will hold your attention 80% of the way. It's not a bad novel, it's simply just not the jam-dropper it has been hyped up to be. If you want jam-dropping, watch the movie adaptation of Fight Club. Many of the novel's problems are solved there. And who doesn't want to see Brad Pitt without sleeves? I mean, come on.
B00005JKTF|4.0|\\"Don't give up hope, Peter, he's a real fighter...\\" That's what Charlotte Gray (Blanchett) was told when she heard her boyfriend, Peter, was shot down in France.

The dream of owning their own land wasn't a matter of a property, rather it was about a peaceful world where friends are totally devoted to each other's protection. In a sense; it is the family that Lennie and George never enjoyed.<br /><br />John Steinbeck explores deep subjects of existence and man's helplessness with a symbolic genius, reminiscent of Kafka's. Steinbeck used a simple story to depict weakness, loneliness, aging, desperation and existence. The dream was so profound and real that the world is incapable of understanding the emptiness that follows, when a dream is crushed.<br /><br />Steinbeck's \\"Of Mice and Men\\" is a fascinating emotional roller coaster that leaves the reader dizzy and flabbergasted. Most characters see their own dreams die in front of their eyes; the readers will be left with some critical moral questions unanswered.<br />Since I read that book, I'm still pondering and re-examining George and Lennie's dream that existed to help them live in a harsh world, more so, than to achieve the dream itself. Dreams are what keep us going, so when they are aborted, regardless if we chose to or if we are forced, life will never be enjoyable again.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I first became aware of Playing for Change when a friend sent \\"Stand By Me\\" the video to me in an email.  I was moved from the very first note.  Bringing the people of the world together is the key to finding World Peace and I applaud these musicians for taking the first step.  Music is the international language and they have done a superb job with the songs on this album.  You can not help but be moved to tears on \\"Stand By Me\\", Biko and the rest of the music will find a place in your soul and you will feel what it is to be one with the music, and through the music, one with the world.  Please Playing for Change, give us more!
B001MYIXAC|4.0|Let the Right One In is about a 12 yr old boy named Oskar who's tormented by bullies at school. A new girl moves in to his apartment building and appears to be the same age as him. They become friends and she gives him the courage to stand up to the bullies. He starts to fall for her and wants to go steady with her but he doesn't know that she's actually a vampire.<br /><br />  The movie is dark and twisted, yet their relationship is kind of sweet. Despite the film being creepy and haunting, it also manages to be likable due to the 2 young leads. The only thing that skeeved me out though, is that they didn't have to show the girl's private area in one scene. It may have just been a glimpse but it was still wrong. You know an American film wouldn't have gotten away with that.<br /><br />  Despite that though I would still recommend it to those who wish Twilight was less romantic, mushy and whimsical. Let the Right One In is kind of romantic but unlike Twilight, you get a good dose of old fashion horror. The direction has an old school feel to it and the film even has the look of a movie from the late 70's or early 80's.
B0009MAO46|4.0|The extras of the movies are \\"whatever\\", but the \\"Toy Story\\" story is fantastic. I recomend buy just the movie in case you are not interested in to see how do PIXARS make the effects that change the world.
B0000AC8LL|5.0|I have always loved this movie. I think it is a interesting depiction of BOTH sides in the attack on Pearl Harbor. Many mistakes were made, many oversights that I hope led to a better scrutiny of political and military paying attention for both countries. And it is a nice little, very entertaining history lesson.
B000UJ48SQ|5.0|Some movies - I wish there were more of them - simply look like a series of great paintings.  This film has that look. You could freeze-frame many of the scenes and swear you were looking at a Gainsborough, a Vermeer, a Hogarth or similar work of art by one the great artists of three to five centuries ago.  It just's beautiful stuff. I hope a Blu-Ray of this is done soon and released as this film is worthy of a great, high-definition disc.    For the visuals, we have Director Stanley Kubrick and Photographer John Alcott to thank. Being a three-hour movie, there are plenty of wonderful shots to admire, too.  In addition, the costumes are lavish and authentic and the scoring is notable. It's no accident that Oscars were garnered for art/set direction, cinematography, costume design and scoring.  Yeah, if you enjoy classical music, you'll really enjoy the soundtrack, toom under the guidance of conductor Leonard Roseman.    Not to be overlooked is the fine acting and the interesting and underrated story.  I say \\"underrated\\" because this film, from what I've read, bored a lot of people and and it was a box-office flop.  That's too bad because, frankly, I found the story (outside of the first 10--15 minutes) to be fascinating. As I watched, I kept wondering what strange occurrences will happen next to the lead character, \\"Redmond Barry/Barry Lyndon,\\" played beautifully by Ryan O'Neal. (For most of the movie, he's called \\"Redmond Barry,\\" so I will refer to him as that.)    In the end, this was a low-key adventure story about the rise-and-fall of a \\"scoundrel\\" back in late 18th century Englishman.  \\"Mr. Barry\\" is an Irishmen living in England who winds up dealing with a number of people: Irish, English, Prussian, French. His dealings with these people are bizarre at times.   While he mainly is shown doing what he can to promote himself, for either monetary gain and prestige of a name and power, he's not all bad. There is a compassionate side to him, but it only shows itselfin small doses. It makes him all the more interesting to watch, because you don't always know how he's going to react to his circumstances, which change radically every few years.     We witness his rise to prominence and then his fall when his \\"sins begin to find him out,\\" as the Bible would describe.  It's quite a roller coaster ride.    This is an emotional, involving story, and a feast for the eyes and ears.  It's quite different, too, certainly not the average fare from Kubrick.  I can only hope this comes out on a high-definition disc some day.  Admirers of this film need to see this in all its glory.

0321200683|3.0|This review is for the kindle version of the book.    So far, the book has been an excellent discussion on integration patterns in general and messaging in particular.  I would likely give the text version of the book a 4 or a 5 on content.    Unfortunately, the Kindle version suffers from some formatting flaws which bring the rating down a bit.    - The table of contents does not link directly to it's contents.  - Sidebar panels and examples (of which there are many) are almost unreadable because they are formatted in a such a way that the text flows off the page.  One must select the text with the thumbstick and scroll back and forth to read it.    Hopefully, Addison-Wesley will correct the errors.
B001V9LPWQ|4.0|This was Walt Disney's first animated full-length movie. I've read where it took somewhere between two to five years to make, and the artwork still stands up to today's standards.    t was good to see Disney releasing a nice Blu-Ray of this. It's pretty sharp and up to the Disney Blu-Ray standards. It makes a great movie all the more great. Not only is the picture improved, but so is the sound, and so is the regular DVD.....so you get a lot of bang for your buck here.    The story is \\"cute\\" because of the seven dwarfs. The evil character - the queen - doesn't have that big a role so most of the time it's just a sweet, enjoyable film with nice characters. It's one of the those movies that makes you feel good as you are watching it.
B000WGWQG8|5.0|Bravo, Bravo...extremely well done!  However, the most important part was not included:  The faith of our founding fathers!  These were men and women who read their Bibles daily and quoted scripture often.  They were people who prayed on their knees, especially during times of great peril.      Consider George Washington's Prayer for the Nation June 8, 1783, that was sent to the governors of all the states:      \\"Almighty God, we make our earnest prayer that Thou wilt keep the United States in Thy Holy protection: that Thou wilt incline the hearts of the citizens to cultivate a spirit of subordination and obedience to government and entertain a brotherly affection and love for one another and for their fellow citizens of the United States at large. And finally, that Thou wilt most graciously be pleased to dispose us all to do justice, to love mercy, and to demean ourselves with that charity, humility, and pacific temper of mind which were the characteristics of the Divine Author of our blessed religion, without a humble imitation of whose example in these things we can never hope to be a happy nation. Grant our supplication, we beseech Thee, through Jesus Christ our Lord.  Amen.\\"  On March 4, 1805, President Jefferson offered \\"A National Prayer for Peace,\\" which petitioned:    \\"Almighty God, Who has given us this good land for our heritage; We humbly beseech Thee that we may always prove ourselves a people mindful of Thy favor and glad to do Thy will. Bless our land with honorable ministry, sound learning, and pure manners.  Save us from violence, discord, and confusion, from pride and arrogance, and from every evil way. Defend our liberties, and fashion into one united people the multitude brought hither out of many kindreds and tongues.  Endow with Thy spirit of wisdom those to whom in Thy Name we entrust the authority of government, that there may be justice and peace at home, and that through obedience to Thy law, we may show forth Thy praise among the nations of the earth.  In time of prosperity fill our hearts with thankfulness, and in the day of trouble, suffer not our trust in Thee to fail; all of which we ask through Jesus Christ our Lord, Amen\\"    President John Adams stated on October 11, 1798:  \\"We have no government armed with power capable of contending with human passions unbridled by morality and religion. Avarice, ambition, revenge, or gallantry, would break the strongest cords of our Constitution as a whale goes through a net. Our Constitution was made only for a moral and religious people. It is wholly inadequate to the government of any other.\\"  \\"We recognize no Sovereign but God, and no King but Jesus!\\"    I recommend reading, \\"The Light and the Glory\\" by Peter Marshal, and \\"America's Godly Heritage\\" by David Barton.  God Bless.
B0000AMRJD|4.0|I found this to be an interesting character study of a Cuban who comes to Miami and becomes a big drug dealer, rising from poverty to become a wealthy big-shot....and then destroying himself. The real down side to living the life of crime is detailed in the story.  Near the end, Pacino is going to bed each night with a gun under his pillow.  Anyone who thinks being a big-time crook is \\"the life,\\" should watch this film and pay attention.     The movie got panned at the time of its release for its excesses in profanity and violence....but now since we've all become desensitized with decades of this stuff, the film is now almost reaching \\"cult status.\\" Now those same flip-flop national critics like it. Amazing.    At the time of this movie's release, Al Pacino (\\"Tony Montana\\") probably set a new Hollywood record for using the f-word in a mainline film, Now it's topped by anyone who performs in a Martin Scorcese film.  Pacino's wife, \\"Elvira\\" played by the beautiful Michelle Peiffer, wasn't a lot more clean-mouthed than her husband. She got really brutal as the film wore on.    If that language is no problem for you, you'll find the story quite interesting and a good study of how paranoia must wind up haunting most gangsters.

B000YIGNKE|5.0|I saw this version of Persuasion first, then the 1995 version.  I have to admit that when I first saw this I thought Anne Elliott quite dowdy.  Her clothes certainly are, but if you want dowdy, see the 1995 version. After seeing this again I think Anne is pretty and, of course, Frederick Wentworth is very handsome.  This version is more fun to watch first, because almost everyone in the film is good-looking (or at least not really bad-looking!), the surroundings are beautiful, I can actually understand what they're saying without having the subtitles on (yes, I needed them for the 1995 version), and the love story is much more believable.  This Capt. Wentworth is one worth pining over for 8 years!  Overall, well done.
1401923119|5.0|It happens on occasion that I cannot put a book down.  It was thus with Bruce Lipton's gem. As a non-scientist I found the 'mystery' of cellular biology so accessible and so easy to understand.  [No wonder his Carribean students excelled!!]   His clarity of mind and expression are a delight, and the manner in which the book unfolded  was a joy for me.  To have the connection to the Universe/God/ All-That-Is illustrated so clearly is truly inspirational and in the end - so simple.  Wonderful stuff.  Thank you so much Bruce Lipton
B001VB8UAE|3.0|I'm a lifelong Streisand fan, have had the pleasure of seeing her perform live - twice - and though I'm sure I'm in a minority here, I don't think this 2006 concert performance is as \\"all that\\" as everyone else seems to think (saw the show when it was in town).  For starters, to state that she has never sounded better is just simply untrue.  I'm not saying that she sounds bad - by any stretch of the imagination; but her timbre has naturally changed, and the range narrowed, over the years; to reach the zenith of \\"A Piece of Sky\\" and the ilk anymore is just out of the question (glad it was avoided this time around).  I still got my DVD copy the day of release (yesterday), but I think it is more than obvious, watching the two concerts back-to-back, that her voice has decreased in its abilities over the years.  But again - before you write any \\"What?!?  Are you crazy?!?!?\\" comments, I do realize that even a decreased-Streisand is miles ahead of any other female singer around today, or perhaps ever.  But \\"never sounded better\\"?  Gimme a break.  Next you'll be saying she's never been thinner...
B001RQ0SJO|4.0|I have to admit that I initially didn't take to Natasha Khan's work as Bat for Lashes when she first hit the music scene. Eventually I did and her first album FUR & GOLD quickly became a favorite go to on my ipod. I new her follow up album TWO SUNS was a must have especially after hearing her song \\"Daniel\\" on her Myspace page. I immediately loved the ethereal melodies and the mid tempo electronic beats on \\"Daniel\\". I recently acquired a copy of TWO SUNS and have been listening to it on a regular basis. TWO SUNS took a few listens for the music to really sink into me. The first two tracks didn't do much for me and still doesn't. They aren't bad per say but I didn't think they were as good as say \\"Daniel\\" or \\"Moon and Moon\\". Some of the songs didn't stand out with me initially but some did. I really love the piano ballad \\"Moon and Moon\\". I like how Natasha's vocals takes front and center. I love the rawness of \\"Peace of Mind\\". I felt like I was watching Natasha Khan perform. Contrary to what one reviewer has to say, I didn't think TWO SUNS was overproduced. TWO SUNS may not be a perfect album but I enjoy it quite a bit. I hope that Natasha Khan's career will flourish for as long as say Stevie Nicks has in a dog eat dog world like the music industry.

Amazing.
0240810961|4.0|Of course Disney will always be synonymous with animation. Their canon of work in the Forties and Fifties is considered by many film critics to be the gold standard of cell animated features.   And with that said, any budding young animator or cartoonist can learn much from the reams of technical information (800 pages worth!) between the covers of  Drawn to Life: 20 Golden Years of Disney Master Classes, Volume 1: The Walt Stanchfield Lectures.  What keeps this book from receiving 5 stars?  The illustrations used as examples of artistic technic are often small.  Some figure drawings (like the ones on page 261) measure about an inch tall. This is the only fault in a book that should be purchased by any art student.
0385751893|5.0|The beauty of this books is that it gives insight both into those we know were oppressed but also those who were misled by Nazi ideology. The narrator is a nine-year-old boy who captures the innocence, playfulness, and curiosity relevant to his age. The writer tends to understate which is a welcome relief from the verbosity of so many novels. The book would be a good vehicle for discussion into the complexity of human behavior.
B00138D1I6|5.0|I love this soundtrack! It combines themes from all three of the movies, which makes it the most diverse of the three soundtracks. There's never a dull moment in it. I listen to it in my car for weeks at a time. The tracks 6 (I See Dead People in Boats), 11 (I Don't Think Now is the Best Time) and 12 (One Day) are my personal highlights, but the entire score is amazing.
0385340990|5.0|Some may deprive themselves of the pleasure of reading this delightful book because the title is apt by deceptive. Before reading this book I had seen a series on PBS about the channel islands and so as I read the book I had images of the series enhancing the words. This book is a page turner and one that ends too soon. It is like a dessert that is so satisfying and just tops off an all-too perfect meal.
B0009QTS1M|5.0|I already owned the original signature series DVD of Gladiator and was completely satisfied with it.  A friend of mine, who is very much into deleted scenes, director's commentary and other extras had purchased the Extended Edition and said that it was very good.  I was never curious about it until I learned that my younger sister did not have the movie Gladiator and was having a difficult time finding it for herself.  I purchsed the Extended Edition for her because I wanted her to have the best version of the movie available and I wanted the one I gave her to be more than what she was expecting to find.  She was very excited to receive it and was surprised by all the additional content.  It was worth the money I spent (over what the 2 disc version cost) and I am certain I will experience the same success/satisfaction with my future Amazon purchases.

B001VB8UAE|5.0|It is true that Barbra's voice has changed over time.  In the 2006 concert DVD you will notice that her range is lower and there is, at times, some hoarseness, which I did not notice at the two concerts that I attended.  Nevertheless, it is still a remarkable instrument and her interpretive abilities are in full force.  If in doubt, simply listen to \\"Unusual Way\\".  I recently attended a Celine Dion concert and, although her voice is in top form, as an audience member, I did not feel a connection to her singing.  When Barbra sang \\"People\\" at the St. Paul concert, I was astounded at her ability to deliver this song to the audience after 40 years of singing it.  She simply touched us all at the level of Soul.    In the 1994 concert DVD, Barbra was in top vocal form.  I especially recommend the 1994 concert CD which is taken from her New York performance.  Her rendition of \\"My Man\\" from that concert is vocally stunning.    Well my friends, I think that this 2006 concert DVD is Barbra's swan song, at least in terms of singing concerts.  So don't be overly critical; simply watch and enjoy one of the greatest performers to ever grace the stage.  When will we see the likes of talent like this again?

B001UREJWM|5.0|The Devil You Know, the new album from Heaven and Hell (better known to Black Sabbath fans as the Black Sabbath with Ronnie James Dio on vocals lineup) is a must own for all Black Sabbath and Ronnie James Dio fans.<br />The reason that Black Sabbath go by Heaven and Hell is because of when Black Sabbath got in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, they went in as original lineup. It's sad that many Ozzy-era fans can't accept Black Sabbath without Ozzy (Sabbath did well without him after they fired Ozzman in 1979). The Devil You Know is the sixth overall album by the Dio-fronted version of Black Sabbath (featuring original Sabbath members guitarist Tony Iommi and bass player Geezer Butler plus lead singer Ronnie James Dio and drummer Vinny Appice whom were the main lineup for the Dio-led carnation of Sabbath which also unleashed classic albums like The Mob Rules and Dehumanizer (Bill Ward drummed on Heaven and Hell in 1980)).<br />Once Dio reunited with Sabbath (which was the reunion of 2007 IMHO aside Genesis reuniting with Phil Collins), the band released a greatest hits album The Dio Years with three new tracks in 2007 and a live album Live at Radio City Music Hall and toured throughout 2007 and 2008 (I saw the band in Boston on September 9, 2007 with Alice Cooper and Queensryche and Heaven and Hell were phenomenal). In between tours, Heaven and Hell recorded this album late last year. Like the last Dio fronted Sabbath album, 1992's Dehumanizer, the album was recorded at Rockfield Studios in Wales (only this time Butler, Dio and Iommi produced it and engineered by Mike Exeter (instead of Mack)). The result is a killer album.<br />The Devil You Know once again proves that Dio will always be the voice of Heavy Metal. His voice I swear has not aged and he has evolved as a singer and a lyricist whereas his predecessor Ozzy now sounds like a caricature of a once-great singer (his awful Black Rain was the worst album he's ever made) and having to lipsynch live and do commercials and FOX Reality and MTV shows whereas Dio can still sing.<br />The thundering \\"Atom and Evil\\" begins this album and is a superb killer opener. Next is another thundering \\"Fear\\" which is a great song which rock. We follow with the album's first single which is \\"Bible Black\\" and starts out like \\"Children of the Sea\\" and \\"Sign of the Southern Cross\\" with excellent acoustic work before going into a heavy piece. Next we pick up the pace a bit with \\"Double the Pain\\" and another great song here. Butler proves why he's metal's greatest bass player on this track. Next is the thundering \\"Rock and Roll Angel\\". This thundering piece just burns and has Iommi playing leads on both electric (in the middle) and acoustic (in the outro) proving he is the greatest left handed guitarist alive in any genre.<br />We then pick up the pace a bit with \\"Turn Up the Screw\\". This rocker opens the second half of the album in a thunderous way and Geezer's bass dominates this track and Dio's vocals rock and Iommi delivers great guitar solos. Next is the fast paced rocker \\"Eating the Cannibals\\". The track may be the shortest song on the album, but it's loud, in-your-face and has lots of b*lls. \\"Follow the Tears\\" follows and is another great song. The opener has organ, guitars, synthesized orchestration which is haunting but turns into a classic rocker. Next we speed up with another fast paced rocker out of \\"Neverwhere\\". Whoever said that people should slow down at 60 needs to stay quiet. We close with \\"Breaking Into Heaven\\" which is a great rocking way to close the album. The beat may be slow but the music is phenomenal and Dio sings like no tomorrow.<br />The Devil You Know is already in my running of Albums of 2009 and so far best metal release of the year.OX Reality and MTV shows whereas Dio can still sing.

B001R4MEUM|5.0|English art rockers Genesis released their seventh (and lone double studio) album entitled The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway in November of 1974.<br />The album was created at a time where tensions in the band were astronomically high. Lead singer Peter Gabriel was going through some personal and professional problems while this album was being created (his daughter was born prematurely and uncertainty if his daughter would live (luckily she survived), his failed attempt at a filmscript and his bandmates were angered that Peter was more concerned about his family than the band (in later years, all the members would become parents)).<br />Despite the on-going tensions in the group, Gabriel created one final masterpiece with Genesis before he left the band in May of 1975 after the tour in support of The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway where the band did the WHOLE DOUBLE ALBUM live start to finish (only The Who and Pink Floyd were other bands of the era that played whole albums start to finish in their set, let's see Britney Spears or any pop fool try it).<br />The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway was a concept album about a Puerto Rican kid named Rael whom falls into a netherworld known as New York and struggles to find himself throughout the course of the album. Some of the many standouts on this album are the title cut, \\"In the Cage\\" (arguably the best song on the album and was resurrected for the 2007 tour), \\"Back in NYC\\", \\"Counting Out Time\\" (released as a single but flopped), \\"The Carpet Crawlers\\" (a concert staple for many years and resurrected for the 2007 reunion tour), \\"The Chamber of 32 Doors\\", \\"The Lamia\\", \\"The Colony of Slippermen\\" and the closing track \\"It\\".<br />The album's other tracks \\"Fly On a Windshield\\", \\"Broadway Melody of 1974\\", \\"Cuckoo Cocoon\\", \\"The Grand Parade of Lifeless Packaging\\", \\"Hairless Heart\\", \\"Lilywhite Lilith\\", \\"The Waiting Room\\" (a great instrumental from the same band who would later write \\"I Can't Dance\\" and \\"Hold On My Heart\\"), \\"Anyway\\" (whose roots go back to pre-Hackett and Collins era Genesis musically), \\"Here Come the Supernatural Anaesthetist\\", \\"Silent Sorrow in Empty Boats\\", \\"Ravine\\", \\"The Light Dies Down On Broadway\\", \\"Riding The Scree\\" and \\"In The Rapids\\" are no filler as well and are great songs though some fairweather Genesis fans may think these tracks stink.<br />I first discovered this album in early September of 1997, when I picked up a used cassette copy (would buy the remastered CD two months later), and I was shocked on how excellent it really is and is today one of my Top 20 favorite rock albums of all time.<br />Unfortunately Peter Gabriel left after the tour in support of this album and eventually guitarist Steve Hackett would quit as well in late 1977.<br />The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway peaked at #41 in early 1975 and would eventually go Gold in the US over time proving that people were willing to give pre-1980s Genesis a chance after discovering the band in the 1980s.<br />In November of 2008, Rhino/Atlantic re-released the album as a 2-CD/1-DVD set. The album was painstakingly remixed by engineer Nick Davis in stereo for excellent sound (kind of like what was done to The Who catalog in the 1990s). The new mixes are AMAZING and I hear things in the new mixes that I have not ever heard before. The DVD was in 5.1 and had an excellent slide show with the album and interviews with band members and an appearance on French television in 1974. In March, 2009, Virgin/EMI re-released the 2008 mix of the album as a 2-CD set. Those who have the box and get annoyed with sliding the CDs in and out of sleeves should get a backup copy in case the discs were badly destroyed from sliding in and out of sleeves.<br />This new mix of Lamb is recommended!k to pre-Hackett and Collins era Genesis musically), \\"Here Come the Supernatural Anaesthetist\\", \\"Silent Sorrow in Empty Boats\\", \\"Ravine\\", \\"The Light Dies Down On Broadway\\", \\"Riding The Scree\\" and \\"In The Rapids\\" are no filler as well and are great songs though some fairweather Genesis fans may think these tracks stink.

1417030003|5.0|[[ASIN:B000C65Z20 The Constant Gardener (Full Screen)]]  This movie is sad and thought-provoking and at times very troublesome.  One must have a strong stomach to watch parts of it.  The music and scenes are lovely, and the portrayal of the African people is very touching indeed.
0762434279|1.0|I was disapointed when I got this book and it was a little mini abridged version of this book. I was looking forward to reading it. On the other hand, amazon took the book back and refunded my money without any hiccups. Was a very good transaction. But I don't think it said abridged when I ordered it, but when I went back to look it says abridged now.
B00243FQFA|4.0|My biggest problem with this season is that SciFi has yet to show all of the episodes for the entire season either on television or the video on demand on their website. And until today I did not know that season 5 was the final season for Atlantis, which really ticks me off.    The last episode I got to see on television was \\"Las Vegas\\", I had my DVR set to record the entire season and for some reason after this episode the series never finished being televised.    I will buy this as soon as it's released on DVD just so I can watch the entire season and see how it ends.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|I've just seen Wicked for the 2nd time and loved it.....again.  It is helpful, I think, to listen to the music and lyrics before seeing the musical.  The lyrics are pretty clever with all kinds of subtle references to the infamous Wizard of Oz movie.  It is sometimes difficult in the live performance to hear the lyrics clearly.  Have listened to this sound track over and over.
B001FB4VZS|5.0|This is an excellent season! The writers never fail, and often times surprise me! I own seasons 1-7 on DVD and will soon purchase this one as well! I can't wait to see the rest of the season, especially when Doomsday finally faces off against Clark! I give this season five stars thus far!
B00003CXIP|5.0|I ordered the DVD of the movie, \\"Stand By Me\\".  I had seen this movie in the theater, back in the '80s, with my sister, Eva Cassidy---the wonderful singer who died in 1996 from cancer......  Eva and I LOVED this movie, and us watching it together in the theater is a wonderful memory I will have forever.......  This movie delves deeply into the hearts, minds, and souls of these youngsters.  It is at times funny, and then heart-breaking, and most people who watch this movie will recall their own childhoods.  This movie is one you will want to watch again and again, which is why I bought the DVD in the first place!  This movie was directed by Rob Reiner, and was based on a story by Stephen King--need I say more?!!!  Buy this for yourself--you will not be disappointed!
0887307280|5.0|A business-savvy friend recommended this book so I decided to read it.  It's an easy, quick read that really got me motivated about my small business again and changed how I see the business...not from a bottom-up perspective, but more of a overarching, macro view with clear structure and goals.  I wish I had read this many years ago when I first started my small business.  Would have saved me a lot of pain and disappointment. But, the good thing is the book lets you see it's not too late and you can still free yourself from being a slave to your business to creating a business that can manage itself without you having to be there every second of every day.  Someone said in a review here that this book was a sales pitch for the writer's business.  I didn't get that feeling except in only few places and it wasn't obtrusive.  The points in this book, if taken to heart, far outweigh the tiny little bit of self-pitching.
B00009ATIX|5.0|This film was amazing.  I actually heard the score before I saw the film and that was my hook.  I realize most people will dislike and even hate this film for the slow somber nature but it really is great.  I hate to be cliche but the film is haunting and mesmerizing and I loved it.  Soderbergh shot the film in his usual beautiful way.  Clooney gives a great performance along with McElhone.  Cliff Martinez finishes the film with an amazing score.  A film that never got noticed for what it is.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I had decided that I wanted to order a workout DVD...something not too lengthy, so that it would be easier for me to stick to.  After looking through a LOT of DVDs, I finally decided on this one due to all of the positive reviews.  I am SO GLAD that I purchased 30 Day Shred!  Here's why:    *First of all, it is definitely not lengthy!  Each of the 3 workouts are just 20-25 minutes long.  Jillian keeps it short, but the fact that she doesn't really allow for rest makes it extremely challeging.  *I love her circuit-training style; it really kept me from getting bored!  I also liked that there were 3 levels, so that you can progress as you get stronger.  *None of the moves are complicated.  It's all old-school stuff that you probably already know how to do.  It's just the way that she combines the movements that will really make you sweat!    I originally planned on doing the Shred for 30 days in a row, with no additional exercise so that I could see how the video worked on its own.  I got through day 26, and then got sick so I had to rest for a week.  After I felt better I picked it back up and finished my last 4 days...and in 30 days I lost 4.5 pounds and 5.5 total inches!  I was thrilled with that, considering I went a whole week without working out and my eating habits weren't perfect at the time.  But I can really SEE and FEEL the difference.  I can see that I've lost a lot of fat off my body, and I'm getting definition in muscles that I didn't even know I had.  On top of that, I'm definitely stronger and more flexible.  I just can't believe such a difference was made in only 30 days!  :)    I plan on continuing to do the Shred a few times a week, combined with Jillian's \\"Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism\\" DVD which I've just started (and also LOVE so far!).  I've only got 6 more pounds to lose and I know I can do it!    GET THIS DVD!  You won't be sorry!  :)      ***And a tip to all those who are sick of seeing the entire intro. every time you start the video:  I think I've figured out a trick!  I use a PS3, and after I'm done with the workout each morning, I select which level I want to do the next day.  As soon as it starts playing, I hit \\"pause\\" and THEN turn off my DVD player.  The next morning it starts where I paused it so I don't have to go through the intro. again!  I don't know if this will work on all DVD players, but it definitely works if you have a PS3!
B00076OMW4|5.0|This is by far the best recording of the New World Symphony. Regardless of its age, there is not question that this recording has stood the test of time. There is not a more meticulous and passionate recording of this piece. The famous Reiner Sound can be heard loud and clear in the first and fourth movements. The famous second movement reflects the mastery of dynamic control that Reiner wielded. While the other pieces were intended as mostly filler to justify the price, they're definitely quality recordings.
0736063684|5.0|Best book on strength training that I've ever seen.  Graphical illustrations on every page.  Good for a total body workout, but especially good if you want to focus on one area.  You simply can't go wrong with this book.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I have watched thousands of videos in my life; being in the music business; but I don't believe I have ever been so moved.  This CD/DVD is a must buy.  The concept from the filmmakers is both original and brilliant.  Adding tracks and overdubbing them into one song took a lot of hard work and it was seamless.    Do yourself a favor and buy this CD/DVD.  You will not be disappointed.  Stand By Me will never sound the same by anyone else again.
B000MRAAJW|1.0|I bought the Planet Earth DVD Series while out on a Temporary Duty Assignment for the Govt.  I didn't bother to open the package until I returned home 3 months later.  When I opened it and put it into my new DVD player, none of the discs loaded in the series.  It kept saying 'LOADING' and then went to 'No Disc'.  I tried to play it on my Portable DVD player just to see if there may be something else going on with the player in my entertainment unit. I tested a couple of other DVDs that I had in my collection thinking maybe it was the DVDs after all and not my player.  Everything else I put in had worked just fine.  I'm very unhappy about this and surely plan to contact Amazon.  I was looking forward to watching the series on my new 42\\" flat panel HD tv.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|This show is absolutely amazing! It's the light hearted drama that I've been waiting years for. I am definitely going to by the DVD when it comes out. I hope it comes back for a second season!
0956010903|5.0|I read the book in the regular Hard-cover version. I loved it, due to the fact that it was MORE HARRY POTTER! Not that it was about the story per-say but it gives you a idea of the famous learning tool they used at Hogwarts which makes the small wizard and witches magical world even more cool and in depth. I would LOVE to have this gorgeous collectors edition and am saving now (as I write this comment)to purchase it. I definitely recommend this book to any hard core Harry Potter fans!!!!!!!!!!!!!

193413712X|5.0|\\"Tinkers\\" is an elegant, memorable literary novel, with a recurring theme (deftly handled) of time; passing time, lost time, fixing time (as in clocks) and what we make of our lives. A beautiful read that I look forward to returning to.
B001B71NOI|5.0|This C.D. is Great I first got the digital download from the nine inch nails website and thought well if I like the songs I will get the CD when it hits stores. Well when I got the download I was BLOWN AWAY Mr. Trent Reznor Has Done It again! So I got My Copy As soon as it came out in June!
0887306713|5.0|This is a wonderful book. I used this book for my staff training. How people will buy into the company's philosophy is a key to grow the business as by-product.
031606792X|5.0|Book was very good , I couldn't put it down!! I can't wait for the movies for this series to come out...
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I originally checked this show out, due to another actor saying in jest(I hope) that Castle was copying the series he is in. I'm glad I did, because this show is fantastic!   Rick Castle(Nathan Fillion) a best selling novelist and father, and Kate Beckett(Stana Katic) a straight lined NYPD detective, have a great chemistry on screen. It's their banter and chemistry that make this show.  All of the actors in this show are very talented. Fillion, I knew from Firefly and Serenity. I hadn't heard of Katic before, but I'm glad they were both was cast in these roles, because I am loving these two characters and actors more and more with each episode.   This is more a dramatic comedy, than just another cop show. Check this show out! It gets better with each episode. It really is the best new show out there at the moment. 5 stars!
B000X44XSS|4.0|The Eraserhead/Short Films of David Lynch DVD set is a must have for all true David Lynch fans. The DVDs contain hours of interviews with David Lynch and booklet with photos and production notes. The only reason I give this product a 4/5 is because of the way the DVD discs were packaged. They put the disks into cardboard sleeves instead of a hard plastic cases, so there is the risk that the disks will scratch when frequently removed from and inserted into the cardboard sleeves. Overall though this is an excellent addition to any Lynch fan's DVD collection!
B000MNP2KI|3.0|Set prior to the previous Bond movies, James Bond (Daniel Craig) is sent on a mission to partake in a high-stakes poker game with the aim of bankrupting Le Chiffre (Mads Mikkelsen), the banker to a major terrorist organization.    There are two ways that you can look at \\"Casino Royale\\": as an entry in the James Bond series of movies or as an adaptation of Ian Fleming's novel of the same name. As a Bond movie, \\"Casino Royale\\" is in many ways a far cry from its predecessors. Gone are the clever quips and the gadgets, yet the makers of this film were smart enough to retain the action sequences (and lots of them), Bond girls (although Eva Green is by no means great) and Judi Dench as M, so there are enough parallels between \\"Casino Royale\\" and the earlier films to keep fans happy.     As an adaptation of the novel, on the other hand, the success of \\"Casino Royale\\" is less clear. \\"Casino Royale\\" is far more faithful to its source than any of the Roger Moore Bond films, but not as faithful as the earlier Sean Connery films (in particular, \\"Dr No\\" - probably the most faithful of all of the Bond movies to its origins). The central elements of the story are taken from the novel, but a lot of extra scenes are added in around them. Almost the entire first hour of the film comprises original material. These extra scenes, however, are, more or less, in the spirit of the novel. The biggest departure from the novel is in the character of Bond himself. The Bond of this movie is an immature, disrespectful loose cannon, while Fleming's Bond is the exact opposite. Several scenes have Bond acting against the direct orders of M, which the Bond of the books would never do.     As for whether Daniel Craig makes a good James Bond or not, that will largely depend on your personal tastes. In my opinion, Craig is not a bad actor, but he is nowhere near as effective a Bond as Sean Connery or even Pierce Brosnan.    Overall, \\"Casino Royale\\" is worth watching, and I am glad that someone has finally made a proper film version of this novel (the earlier, David Niven film of the same name bears little resemblance to the book and is one of the worst films I have ever seen), but it doesn't quite live up to the high standards set by some of the earlier Bond films, in particular \\"Dr No\\" and \\"Goldfinger\\".
B001PPLIEG|3.0|DVD quality shakey at best as there were several scenes that would not play.  Excellent James Bond movie disrupted by scene skips.
0061689246|4.0|Many will want to read this book after watching great movie adaptation of the story, just like me. I would like to warn these people that while movie follows the book very closely, the feel of the book is completely different.<br /><br />Neil Gaiman presents us with a haunting fairy tale, written in a poetic style similar to Tolkien's. The book doesn't have that sunny feel and Happily-Ever-After-For-Everybody the movie had. Ending leaves you a little sad. That's probably why the book stayed with me much longer than the movie.<br /><br />I would also recommend reading the graphic novel version of the book, because it enhances the story immensely.<br /><br />Finally, this is definitely a fairy tale for adults. You will come across a couple of rather graphic sex scene and some scenes with violent content. So be cautious if you are planning to read it to you children.<br /><br />Overall, great experience. I will definitely read other works by this author.

B001UREJWM|5.0|First to write this lines, i readed all the other rewiews, i`m really sorry that the album don`t have 5 stars for the coments of Ozzy fans or for taste of some Black Sabbath fans, for me pariculary, Ronnie James Dio it was and still is the best Singer that Iommy could find to the band, with or with out the name BS. When the album begins, you remember the atmosphere of the Devil Cried, and maybe you can arrive to think that the album will be the same across al the songs, but the sound of the riffs, the darkness in each song, the powerfull bass, the sound of drums and of curse the sinister voice of Dio make this album a really master piece.    Sons like Fear, Turn of the Screw, Rock & Roll Angel will carry you to a band that put in this album, energy, passion and streght. I understan perfectly that the taste of fans can be diferent, but in my opinion, this is and album that all metal fans must have in his personal collection.    Cheers
B00004YM0D|5.0|My family and I have watched the movie many many times and the volume always ends up full blast in our living room. The CD is great to have if you just love the tunes from the movie---or if you grew up hearing them!
B000NVIGC0|5.0|None of the other reviews I've read here seems to have noticed that this beautiful album is a song cycle about a man (Tweedy) struggling to remain positive, hopeful and open-hearted while his partner has (temporarily?) left their home together to go back to living with her mother.
0525951113|3.0|Daniel Suarez has a story concept that is imaginative, timely, and fast-paced, but there are just too many flaws to call it a good read.     Daemon has a strong start, but its chock full of paper-thin characters that are left dangling in plot dead ends.  About halfway through, the reader becomes uncomfortably aware that Mr. Suarez can't resolve the numerous characters and plot elements he's created.  My wife stopped reading at this point, but I continued hoping Daemon wouldn't leave me hanging.  I was wrong!  Suarez also seems unsure as to whether he's writing a novel or a screenplay.  There are too many \\"action sequences\\" that don't advance the plot or develop the characters.      Daniel Suarez has a great imagination, surely enough for a second novel, and my hope is his craft will get better.  So, my recommendation is to wait for his second effort and read the reviews first.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|This is a great album. If you haven't purchased it yet DO IT. You won't be disapointed!

B0002F7I9Y|4.0|Ray's vocals are very tiny and fraile, but one must remember the man was 74 (Seventy-Four) years old! There are no let-me-get-on-the phone-and-play this-for-somebody-to-hear songs to be found here. \\"Here We Go Again\\" with Norah Jones was the cut that won several of the Grammy Awards...How?...we'll never know (Play this up against the 'Original' version from 1967, and you tell me which one sounds the best?). There was a total of 14 (Fourteen) Grammy Awards won for this album! I really think this was the Grammy Voters, and the everybody else simply saying THANK YOU RAY CHARLES FOR GIVING US OVER 50 YEARS OF HISTORY MAKING RECORDINGS!    Album highlights: \\"Hey Girl\\" with Michael McDonald, \\"Over The Rainbow\\" with Johnny Mathis which was played during the parting view of Ray's body during his televised Homegoing Service...That should tell you how great this song is!, and \\"Crazy Love\\" with Van Morrison. This was a nice way to a long career in this business we call music. Now the story doesn't end here...Rhino/Atlantic rush-released an album of duets recorded in 1997-1998 entitled \\"Genuis And Friends\\" which is a better album, but because of Rhino trying to cash in on \\"Genius Loves Company\\" it was met with so-so reviews, lackluster sales and Light Airplay, but still worth having in your collection. In 2005 there was a Box Set that covered his complete Atlantic Records recordings (1952-1959). There wasn't a whole lot of surprises because when Ray signed with ABC Records in late 1959 Atlantic was grabbing almost anything in vaults and releasing Albums and Singles, so there are no major surprises on the Box set. When I save up enough $$$, I'll be buying a copy (And reviewing it...Stay tuned!).    In late 1959 Ray signed with ABC Records who gave him complete control of his recordings. Whatever idea he (Ray) would come up with they (ABC) would give him the gren light, so from the early years (1959 to 1964) they was several Singles that never made it to Albums (Not that they were bad, they just simply were not include for Album release). They are at least 12 (Twelve) from this period that have yet to see the light on Compact Disc! And another 12 (Twelve) or more from 1965 to 1973. In 1965 Ray opened up his R.P.M. Studio and the core of his recordings took place there up until his death in June 0f 2004. Ray would remain with ABC Records for a total of 14 years! So you can imagine how many Unreleased Recordings are sitting in the vaults??? And that's just from the ABC years (1959 to 1973). In 1974 Ray formed Crossover Records and released several albums independently...Did a deal with Atlantic Records (With his Crossover Records imprint). So in short there is a wealth of Unreleased recordings! Hopefully some Record Company will make us happy one day SOON...The only thing we can do now is hope.
B0000009S3|5.0|Let me begin by saying that after jazz and classical music, Zappa's music means the most to me.  Not much more can be said about this album in light of the multitudinous reviews which have been posted.  However, I would like to make this observation, particularly to those familiar with Zappa's catalog:  \\"Hot Rats\\" & \\"Uncle Meat\\" are 2 rare instances in Zappa's output where his improvisations reflect the melodic contour and sophistication of his compositions.  If you listen to any Zappa recordings made prior to or after these two landmark albums, the overwhelming majority of his guitar solos are melodically blues solos (albeit with often unusual phrasing and rhthyms).  This is true even of Shut Up & Player Yer Guitar.  Now, I'm not referring to his ensemble work on other albums.  Zappa's playing in that regard on tracks like \\"Zombie Wolf\\" or \\"Big Swifty\\" show that he was able to incorporate his guitar into the compositional framework of the ensemble and not have it sound \\"guitaristic\\" (e.g., \\"bluesy\\").  However, his solos in my view generally (if slightly) pale in comparison to his writing on most of his ablums.    Hot Rats and Uncle Meat are 2 albums, by exception, where there is no doubt that Zappa could IMPROVISE on guitar.  The key tracks in my view are \\"Nine Types of Industrial Pollution\\" on Meat and \\"Son of Mr. Green Genes\\" on Rats.  I come from a jazz background, and a small part of my interest in Zappa is how he relates to that tradition.  I don't think he was a jazz musician, per se.  He largely did not display the ability to improvise in a \\"jazz\\" sense, although he certainly employed jazz musicians (George Duke, Jean-Luc Ponty, The Brecker Brothers, etc.), he was able to compose and arrange in a way that allowed them to improvise \\"in a jazz sense\\", and his tunes were performed by jazz musicians not otherwise associated with him (check out Woody Herman's interesting version of \\"America Drinks and Goes Home\\").  Just listen to the last chorus that Zappa takeson \\"Genes\\".  You could transcribe THAT SOLO and harmonize it for any big band and it would sound great.    Just an observation.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|Great story, memorable characters, superb acting, brisk pacing, elegant camera work, lush musical score. I've been watching BBC/Masterpiece Theatre productions since 1971 and this rates among the very best.<br /><br />The adaptation by Andrew Davies manages to include every major episode from Dickens' sprawling book, but makes each more concise and compelling. The story has everything: heroes, villains, mystery, family dysfunction, unrequited love, greed, selflessness - all leavened with hilarious comic bits by some of the quirkier characters.<br /><br />Kudos to the acting company: each actor, whether bit player or star, attacks their role with such brio that viewers will be delighted and pressing the 'rewind' button to watch again. Standouts in a stellar cast are Eddie Marsan as Pancks, Emma Pierson as Fanny, Amanda Redman as Mrs. Merdle (a real hoot), and Russell Tovey as John Chivery (who may bring tears to your eyes). The scenes between newcomer Claire Foy as Little Dorrit and stage/screen vet Tom Courtenay as her father were especially moving.<br /><br />In this series, Amy Dorrit is somewhat more assertive than in the book and previous film, making her more relatable to a modern audience. The age difference between her and Arthur Clennam seemed less extreme, making their relationship more credible as well. Amy and Arthur are such kind, moral characters, they could have seemed cloying or even boring. But their stories are compelling because their goodness is challenged by so many obstacles, yet endures. What a pleasure to see, in our increasingly decadent culture, that kind of decency depicted in a heroic light and rewarded.<br /><br />The musical score by John Lunn is impressive and deserves its own CD.
B001TK3XO0|5.0|I'll admit that I have never thought all that much about the plight of the Afganistan peoples, but this book really enlightened me on their struggles and plights. I had no idea what a both wonderful and violent past this country has. It is so well written and touching, it draws you in from the very first page. The ending is so well sculpted and thought out. I thank you, Khalid Housseini for writing this eye-opening book.
0895260131|5.0|Before I read this book, I thought I had at least a fundamental understanding of Islam and what it really means within the world context. After reading this book, I realized that I knew a lot less about this topic than I thought I did. The truth about Islam is really frightening, and it's much more terrible than we have been led to believe.<br /><br />For some, that might sound offensive or overdramatic. To some I might even be overstating the dangers, but after reading this book, I don't think so. Since this book is written by a top Islamic expert, Robert Spencer, I don't think I'm overstating anything.<br /><br />The first thing I learned is what Muslims have been screaming about the Crusades for hundreds of years are simply lies. History didn't happen the way they claim. In spite of their claims that Muslims have more claim to places like Jerusalem, these claims simply don't hold water. While Jerusalem is mentioned in the Bible over 800 times, it's not mentioned once in the Koran. In fact, there's no archeology to back up the Koran at all.<br /><br />The Crusaders didn't go to Jerusalem to wipe out Muslims and murder them. They went because the Christians in the Holy Land had been repeatedly brutalized and treated as second class citizens. Christians were repeatedly persecuted, and the Crusaders went to stop it.<br /><br />One thing that isn't talked about by mainstream press, or anyone else for that matter, is just how violent Islam is. Reading the Koran is only the beginning. In practice is where you see how Muslims have discriminated againsts all non Muslims. In fact, Muhammed is the one who started it all.<br /><br />He conducted 80 military campaigns trying to spread Islam. When he went to Medina, one of the holy cities of Islam, and they refused to convert, he murdered everyone in the city. Just one example of just how violent Islam is.<br /><br />Then there is the myth that non Muslims can negotiate with Muslims. The Founding Fathers of the United States found out early in the beginning of the 19th Century how absurd this was, and it's explained in the book. Islam has had a violent history from the beginning, and anywhere that non Muslims have refused to convert when the demand was made, there has been violence.<br /><br />There's a whole lot more. If you're looking for all of the reasons why Islam is violent, and why it would be a mistake to convert, you will certainly find them in this book. The truth about Islam is thoroughly documented with facts and evidence.<br /><br />For those who are non Muslim, this book is guaranteed to make your skin crawl it's so creepy. For those who are Muslim, I have to say I feel really sorry for you for being so brainwashed, especially for those who believe Islam is peaceful.<br /><br />Regardless on your stance on the issue, this is a must read, and it will definitely clear up any misunderstandings you may have had on this topic before. Lots of recommended resources too so you may explore the issue further.ury how absurd this was, and it's explained in the book.

0756405890|3.0|Fantasy readers have a tendency to hand out five-star reviews like Mardi-Gras beads. To me a five-star review is the sort of thing that should be saved and passed out sparingly only to the very best books that come along. The Name of the Wind is definitely not among the best.    My paperback copy was over 700 pages long and I found it amazing that so little could happen (in the first in a series, no less) in so long a book. A young man loses his parents, lives as a beggar in a big city for a few years, attends a university, learns some magic, and gets into a few scrapes though nothing he can't easily get himself out of. And then the story simply stops.    Epic fantasy this is not. No battles are fought, not cities fall, no kings are dethroned, no quests are undertaken. The comparisons to the Harry Potter books are apt as far as they go, but they are actually probably unfair to the Potter books. In each Harry Potter book our heroes engage dark forces in battle and the stakes are very high. Not so in The Name of the Wind. Also, despite their many flaws, the Harry Potter books do at least have very clearly drawn characters. I couldn't tell you the first thing about any of Kvothe's friends or professors at the university.    And yet, somehow I was completely engaged through all 700 pages. I can't even say why, but I was concerned about Kvothe and wanted him to do well and to learn the skills he needs for his inevitable battle with those dark forces that are but the vaguest shadow in the background of this book.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This movie is shot really well. The scenes are beautiful. The modern settings along with their starkness are elegant and quiet. Although I am not sure you could go all that wrong shooting in a country like Sweden. The special effects are nice, not over done, and not as hokey as some vampire movies take it. The story is good overall, but I would suggest reading the subtitles and watching it in Swedish. The English dubbed is a little too weird and can distract you from a really great movie.
0749399570|4.0|Amy Tan's novel is a literary classic about the challenges of culture and the weaving of the bond between mothers and daughters. Tan writes the novel displaying the power and struggles with women, with male characters playing a very small role. It was an interesting read due to the fact that many of the daughters were struggling to become more American, and less of their original heritage. The only tough part about this book for me was how heavily it was aimed towards females and their bonds with one another, but the parables between each story added to the intrigue built throughout the book. Overall, I enjoyed each story even though I am a male and I strongly feel that this book will be important throughout the ages as it deals with the maturity as well as remembering your heritage.

B000JIHP88|5.0|Our daughter relies on this mobile to fall asleep every night and at each nap time. Even when she's fussy and fighting sleep, the mobile almost always draws her in even when I expect her to know better than to fall for its mesmerizing powers. And when she's playful and awake, she happily watches it, kicking her legs, until she burns off her excess energy and dozes off. It's almost like a friend to her, comforting her when she's left alone to sleep.<br /><br />This past weekend we were away from home and were without the mobile for one of the first times in her life (she's 7 mos.). It took hours to get her to sleep, despite being obviously exhausted and despite having a different soothing toy there with her. It was so obvious she was looking for it whenever we tried to lay her down. The night we got home, she was overtired but seemed so relieved to be reunited with her mobile. She dozed off without a peep. I guess the only downside is that obviously she might be too reliant on it, but if it means having a baby go down easily on a regular basis, I'm okay with that.

(I refuse to watch the movies) and I have to say that my favorite version of my favorite couple of all time (and most famous) is the version from Smallville. Tom and Erica have great chemistry, and while i'm a little upset that Clark and Lois haven't even kissed yet (they have but they were under spells or didn't know the true identity of the other person), i am extremely please with this season.    I have been with Smallville ever since season 1 and i have to say that it got better with the addition of Lois.    I LOVED season 8 and I'm ecstatic that both Lois and Clark are on the cover for Season 8. It's like a four year anniversary (they were both on season 4 together) and i have to say they look amazing. This is the best birthday gift ever lol. But yeah. i'm happy it's just them two.

B0002OERI0|5.0|Do you remember how Green day used to sing about relationships, the confussion phase of being a teenager? Well, I do! Albums like \\"Dookie\\" (1994)and \\"Insomniac\\" (1996) helped to continue defining the 90's generation after Kurt Cobain's death. But let's make something clear here. Billie Joe and company DID NOT have in mind to do that. They just happened to realese one of the greatest albums of the 90's (Dookie) at that time. Now, when \\"American Idiot\\" was realesed and I got the chance to buy it and to listen to it from the beginning to the end of it... it just blew my mind! Let me explain this to you while the cd was being played. I remember I was preparing some stuff for my job the next day when I decided to play the album on my stereo. It was at night. So, \\"american idiot\\" started... a song I already knew since it was the single... but as soon as \\"jesus of suburbia\\" went in... I stopped doing my stuff to listen to that particular song and I went: \\"wait! is this actually Green Day??? the Green Day I knew because of Dookie?\\" This song is the one that best describes how the band was NO joking around anymore. Anyway, as soon as the album moved on with \\"holiday\\", \\"boulevard of broken dreams\\", \\"Are we the waiting?\\"... I said to myself, \\"Damn!! what did they do? This is awesome!!!!\\" Personally, there were a few tracks that got my attention right away: 1.- Jesus of suburbia... was a powerful song with great lyrics, totally honest and filled with this anger that it seemed that Billie had kept to himself for quite a few years already... impossible to describe it with words. 2.- St. Jimmy.. not because of the music because I would say that one is totally Green Day... no doubts about it but lyrically... had a lot of content with such simple words (\\"...king of the thieves and I'm here to represent the needle in the vein of the establishment. I'm the patron saint of the denial with an angelface and a taste for suicidal. I'm the son of a bitch and Edgar Allan Poe raiseed in the city under a halo of lights... the product of war and fear we've been victimized...\\"). 3.- Give me novocaine... what a great way to approach a song... goes acoustic and the goes rock... and then goes back into acoustic. 4.- Wake me up when september ends... it is said that this was made for Billie's grandpa who passed away somewhere between the production of this album but I do believe that there's something hide in this track related with September 11th and what happened then in the US... besides... did you notice that this track it's actually the 11th on the CD... coincidence? maybe. 5.- Homecoming... this one has a great structure (a la JOS). 6.- Whatsername... this one close the album with a feeling of desolation and sadness (that I'm sure is the door to open the new album \\"21st century breakdown\\").<br /><br />There has been bands that tried to follow what Green Day was doing in the early 2000's (and 1999 too): Blink 182... to mention the most obvious one. But, when American idiot came out it looked like Green day was sending a message to be read in a two-way form: 1.- We do not like the US government's way to work and we are going to say it out loud... wheter politicians like it or not...wheter they care or not. 2.- We are going to put our foot down to let other bands like us know that they are not us and they will have to work even harder to be like us. Therefore... there's the slap in the face I talked about.<br /><br />Is American Idiot a comercial album? YES... Is American Idiot an addition next to Dookie? NO! Does American Idiot represents an \\"after/before\\" phase in the Green Day's timeline? HELL YES! Did American Idiot influenced in the american public opinion to kicked George W. Bush (or his mate Mc. Cain to went in) out of the White House in the last elections? Hahaha.. only God knows. Do you need guts to realese an album like American Idiot back in the days when it was realesed? FOR THE LOVE OF GOD!... YES!!!!... Specially if the rest of the bands fromthe main stream (with the exception of R.E.M. (Around the sun-2004) or U2 (How to desmantle an atomic bomb-2005) maybe) were just fooling around wirth other topics in their albums just to pleased the media and the bunch of hollow fans for the love of the masses... when late at night.. something was going on with the goevrnment, war and decisions that were being taken.tream (with the exception of R.E.M.

0312360266|3.0|I can't say that this book is bad. It has a very good concept, but I don't know exactly how I feel about the book. It is written in a language geared towards adolescents and teens, but the content of the book is very sexual and suggestive with a touch of drug use involved. It's definately something that I would not allow my teenage daughter to read. I am a huge fan of the Twilight Saga as well as vampires in general, and the basis for this story was a great concept, but I thought that it should have been written differently. If the book was written in language geared towards teens, than the content should have been taken down a notch. It could have been written towards a young adult audience and kept the suggestive language, but the writing itself should have been geared towards the prospective age group. The Twilight Saga was written about the same age group, but the language was understood by all ages. This book fell a little short. Great concept and story line, but the language used was not the greatest. If you enjoy vampire novels, try this one, but it's not something I would allow my 10 year old to read.
1416562605|5.0|Here are some thoughts from a friend, which I felt would be useful for potential readers:      a) Special use of colloquial language--The narration is not in regular English. It is written in a way that sounds very Indian (hindi) when you read it (use of present progressive tense for everything is sssssoooo Indian). It sounds awkward in written English, but Indians will be able to pick up why it is used excessively in the book. It gives a unique flavor. One of the pioneers in this style of writing was Pearl Buck (in her book, Good Earth)...she based her English narration on local Chinese way of speaking.     b) Superb interplay of \\"definite\\" characters and \\"stereotypes\\"--He has played beautifully with the abstract and the concrete in characterization. He has sketched some characters in a more personal way and given them specific names and backgrounds, whereas some characters are depicted in terms of stereotypes (e.g. corrupt politician \\"type\\" -- great socialist, oppressive zamindar --the stork). He intentionally does not personalize these characters and stays with the stereotypes. But he does this without seeming strained or disconnected. I think it is a very difficult thing to do.    c) Use of metaphors: I really liked his use of metaphors--e.g. dark side versus light side (down trodden rural towns versus properous cities), sea versus rivers (to represent the vastness of resources available to the cities, whereas passing, scarce resources available to rural towns that ultimately flow into the cities (sea).     d) Contextualization of the character: He has contextualized the central character torn between the boom and poverty. It reminded my of Ralph Allison's invisible man (pre-civil rights movement)--one of my favorite books, highly recommend it.    e) Great interplay of tragedy, comedy, and satire: The book is quite diverse in its narration. There are parts that are hilarious, and parts that are very touching and sad, and parts that are plain disgusting. He has done a great job blending these different forms together. It is very difficult to do.    f) Humanizing a murder: He has picked the murder part (planning, rationalizing, redemption) of the book straight from dostoevsky. I did not think he did a very good job with that. But then anyone would fall far short of Dostoevsky:)    g) Food for thinking: I am still trying to figure out why he was writing letters to the Chinese premier.     h) Keen observation of little things: E.g. how domestic helpers figures out instantly (within the first few minutes) who is the head of the family and define their way of addressing based on their judgment. The person is not necessarily the eldest or the male, it could be anyone.  Just left me with an impression of keen observation. Very few writers have that--Rabindranath Tagore comes to mind. Of course I am not comparing Adiga with Tagore. Tagore is really a legend. But I found some overlaps.    i) Visual depiction: I really like books that provide a vivid visual picture of a situation in their writing. That is why I liked Rohington Mistry and Arundati Roy so much. Adiga has also done that in some parts of the book--e.g. his description of his young mother's funeral and how her hand is fighting the fire to survive even after her death will stay with me forever:( It is both visual and metaphorical)

B0017V7GTY|5.0|Friend of mine was playing this at their house and it really caught my ear. Definitely reminded me of The Killers. But when I got the album and really listened to it (not in the background of a party), I saw it wasn't a clone of anyone, even The Boss. They definitely share a certain vibe with bands like The Killers, but Gaslight's their own shark and if they can follow through on the next album, they'll go far.    I really like their taste for nostalgia; every song bleeds with a love for old movies and music. The music and lyrics are clever and catchy. Rhythm and notes are used so well and you can feel every bit of it.    If you're on the fence about this one, I say go for it. It's one of the rare albums that I loved from beginning to end. If you've heard any song from this album and liked it, I'm positive you'll like the whole thing. Oh, and if they come to a town near you, see 'em. They're great live.
B001NESPHC|4.0|Melody's first CD - Worrisome Heart - got me hooked - it went straight to the heart. Both the vocal and musical understatement - the delicacy - was done to perfection. It reminded me of the visual artist that conveys emotion with just a few brush strokes. I bought the new album as soon as it was released. \\"If the Stars Were Mine\\" - such sweet sentiment. \\"Who will comfort me\\" - conveys so simply what we have all felt in a gentle but upbeat way. Her emotional honesty rings true - she touches your soul. This young singer/song writer is so talented.

B0026GBIB6|2.0|...the band they were in the past. I won't regurgitate what others have written here and this review is not meant to critically dissect their music. However I will say that I was excited for this release; DM has been one of my favorite bands for over two decades. Unfortunately, to me SOTU is very disappointing. What first attracted me to DM (in the 80s) was their cutting edge synth & dance sound. There was enough of that in their music until Exciter - which I deem their most boring effort - to continue to keep me hooked. However, SOTU is a close second for \\"worst DM album\\" IMO. If you are looking for upbeat, danceable, innovative synthpop, this is definitely not the CD for you...or for me. With PTA there was somewhat of a \\"return to form\\"; Precious (and its various remixes) are excellent at the least. SOTU offers no such thing. As much as I hate to, I think this and Exciter will be the only DM CDs to date that I do not keep in my collection. To see how synthpop can be kept alive and well over a 20+ year plus time span, check out PSB's \\"Yes\\" or Erasure's most recent. These artists still release catchy tunes you can dance to. Hopefully, DM's tour this fall will still be as energetic as the PTA tour and the many before that.

0312427999|5.0|I read The Shock Doctrine and Globalization and the Poor recently within a few days of each other, and was struck by how differently they treat the same issue of trade globalization.  Both books are thoroughly researched and well written, and both argue in favor of changing current trade practices so that sweeping economic changes will inflict less harm on the poorest and most vulnerable segments of society.  Jay R. Mandle is a professor of economics at Colgate University, author of several books on economic development and economic growth, and a political activist for election reform.  Naomi Klein is a journalist first and foremost, a much published author, and a passionate reformer.  Their different backgrounds are reflected in the two books: Globalization and the Poor is an academic treatise on globalization, its systems and institutions, whereas The Shock Doctrine is a scorching indictment of those who control its implementation.    Globalization and the Poor (G&P).  Dr. Mandle presents a detailed and cogent analysis of globalization, and the progress of  international trade through the past several decades. While the presentation is detailed and somewhat technical, it provides sufficient tutorial information to be accessible to the layman. With his descriptions of the General Agreement on Tarriffs and Trade (GATT), the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP), the North American Free Trade Agreeement (NAFTA), and other 20th century systems of trade and international finance, Mandle has provided a fine overview of the fundamentals of world trade in our time.   G&P describes the major arguments favoring globalization along with a detailed description of three primary sources of opposition. The forces for globalization are in search of market growth and increased profits through lower costs. Multinational corporations take advantage of advances in computerization, communication technology and information technology to move production, distribution, and, more recently, services to the most cost effective locations in the world. These migrations have been very effective in increasing trade, and have on the whole increased 3rd world exports and elevated the standard of living in many parts of the developing world. Mandle groups opposition to globalization in three categories. First there are those who would have the US act unilaterally to alter global trade practices. This group is not cohesive: many altruists in the \\"unilateralist\\" category insist on changes that will limit harm to the poorest populations, while many other \\"unilateralists\\" are primarily interested in protecting U.S. jobs. A second opposition group favors \\"the economics of localism\\", moving entirely away from globalization and returning to a kinder, gentler world of local economies. The third is the Student Anti-Sweatshop Movement, which \\"seeks to improve the wages and working conditions present in the third world's apparel industry,\\" by pressuring producers to pay higher wages and provide safe work environments.   Mandle's position is that globalization is a fact of life, and that the world in fact needs globalization in order to elevate the world's poorest out of their abject poverty.  But he also contends that the growth must be supplemented with adequate market controls and social protections to prevent driving millions into poverty as a result of the sweeping economic changes that globalization entails.    The Shock Doctrine (TSD).  In contrast to Mandle's measured and dispassionate explanation of globalization's fundamentals, Klein takes us on a tour of the dark underbelly of what she terms \\"disaster capitalism.\\" Her basic premise is that globalization has been used as a weapon by proponents of Milton Friedman's \\"Chicago School of Economics,\\" waging economic war on defenseless governments and populations who are in shock after some cataclysmic change.  The shock might be the result of a major political change, the end of a civil war, or a natural disastersuch as a hurricane or tsunami. The \\"disaster capitalists\\" skillfully extract mineral wealth and privatize public resources, always leaving the population in much worse condition for generations to come. Klein cites case after case in which the core Chicago School principles of privatizing public resources, deregulating business, and slashing government services, have been applied to societies when they were most desperate for a hand up.  The instruments for executing these programs have been the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization, which Klein sees as being in the service of disaster capitalism.   One of the TSD  case studies -Poland's Solidarity movement - may resonate with readers because of the prominent media coverage at the time. During the 1980's the western world watched mesmerized as Lech Walesa and Solidarity struggled and finally gained control of the Polish government with huge wins in democratic elections. The western world was ecstatic, and we expected Poland's democracy to join ours as a junior partner. But when the excitement died down and the media moved on, a different plan unfolded. The communists had left Poland deeply in debt, in addition to which a great deal of investment was needed to give the economy a boost along its new democratic path. Instead of a hand up, however, Klein tells us that the IMF, run by Chicago School economists \\"let the country fall deeper and deeper into debt and inflation,\\" knowing that the weaker Poland became, the more amenable it would be to privatizing its public resources. Doing its part, the US Government under George H. W. Bush insisted that Poland repay all debts amassed during Communist rule.  So, instead of giving Poland a well deserved helping hand into the western economy where they might have become healthy trade partners, we took advantage of the shock and disarray to sell off Poland's mining, shipyards and factories at a fraction of their value. The buyers were primarily non-Polish multinational corporations who promptly fired huge numbers of workers. Poles lapsed into worse poverty than they had experienced under Communism, and have yet to recover even now.  Those of us who naïvely wished the Poles well were left wondering whatever happened to Poland's dream. There was of course no outcry on the major media outlets to notify us of the change in plan.   TSD includes about twenty case studies of this sort, including our own New Orleans, which has been made over into a newer, wealthier, whiter model following hurricane Katrina and the ouster of most of the poor African American population. It is a painful book to read - I found that one chapter at a time was the way to do it, with breaks for light fiction in between.  Summary. Both of these books are good reading and discussing with your friends. Globalization and the Poor is a much needed tutorial on how world trade works, and the Shock Doctrine is yet another wake up call for those who think that U.S. power should be used for good in the world. Although their books are very different, Mandle and Klein share a progressive, humanitarian world view, that trade should not be used to do harm. In their writing, both agree that we need to bring significant change to the practices of international trade before globalization proponents can claim to live up to that view.

B001SN78JO|1.0|This movie is typical Jim Carrey nonsense.  Call me a prude but I don't think it's necessary to include oral sex in a PG-13 movie.  I watched this movie with my 13-yr-old and 16-yr-old and was totally embarrassed during the scene with Carl's neighbor, Tilly.  My son fast forwarded it to the next scene.    Some parents may not care.  Some may not have the time to check.  But I think it's totally unnecessary to include that kind of sexual practice in a PG-13 movie.  Either it shouldn't be allowed or a new rating should be developed.  There are hundreds of impressionable middle school students who watch these kinds of movies and think it's ok to behave in that way.  Seeing it on the big screen just promotes it.    What happened to good clean romantic comedys?
B000BW7QWW|5.0|It was what I expected.  The movie was in good shape.  I would buy from this dealer again.
B0000942HV|1.0|Mike Oldfield has bludgeoned the life out of a lovely piece of music, if you want to hear it, get the original one.
B001NDR5UQ|4.0|After the brilliant \\"Wildflowers\\", this is my favourite Tom Petty album although \\"purist\\" fans may prefer \\"Damn the Torpedoes\\" or some other album dating from his Heartbreakers days or may complain that this is more of a Travelling Wilburys' album and yet this is still very much a Tom Petty album albeit with lots of Jeff Lynne included and yet is still very, very good.<br /><br />I remember playing along with my acoustic guitar to all the tracks from this album and singing along as well; very few cds were as much fun for me to listen to and to actually get involved with with my guitar as this one is.  Composition-wise, only 3 of the 12 tracks here are solely credited to Tom Petty with an astounding 7 tracks being co-written with Jeff Lynne from ELO and another 2 with Mike Campbell with all 3 co-producing this album.<br /><br />Tom Petty appears to have been inspired though with the involvement of the rest of the Travelling Wilbury's and so raised his game for this great album.  The late, great ex-Beatle George Harrison played acoustic guitar and sang backup vocals on \\"I Won't Back Down\\" while the other late, great Roy Orbison did backup vocals on \\"Zombie Zoo\\".<br /><br />This mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) version is also a treat for fans as the sound quality has been remastered and is a definite improvement over the old cd that I used to play so often before and also includes a cardboard square replica of the original lp center circle and faithfully reproduces the vinyl inner jacket as well as having a 12-page insert with all the lyrics in both English and Japanese.<br /><br />The price of this baby though seems extremely high and I would have preferred thicker cardboard and a better designed mlps to justify the extra price but at least the sound quality is an improvement over the copy that I had.
0060920084|3.0|Just briefly here--I'm not going to go through the whole book. I like Bill Bryson and know that obviously the guy is very smart and a talented, entertaining writer. Bryson's \\"A Short History of Nearly Everything\\" and \\"A Walk in the Woods\\" are favorites. OK, so I was disappointed in this. Why? I gained no insights into American life, small town or urban. And I found the overall tone of the book a little too negative in that Bryson at times seemed to be just mocking the small town folk with their funny ways of talkin', their funny names, their overall ignorance. Duh, for lack of a better word... I've traveled myself around this continent. He complains too much. I love being on the road. \\"Lost\\" he says. I may have missed something but did he mean it ironically? I don't feel like just laughing at rednecks and small town weirdos. I mean I already do. But if I read a book--ESPECIALLY by a guy as sharp as Bryson--I'd like better jokes and insights than I come up with. I kept feeling like, \\"tell me something I don't know\\". And our cities are dirty and violent. Yep. Bryson did his trip in the late 80s but that isn't so long ago. Well I got the impression the book was largely written for his British audience about that crazy, forever mind-bendingly backward, foreign land of his childhood. The funny thing with this book is the author has largely become a stranger to his own country but I can't relate enough to the x-pat's trip. It is all too familiar.
0312383320|5.0|This is the best of the \\"Between the Numbers\\" Plum novels. Great characters, as always, and the banter between Stephanie and Diesel is rapid fire fun.
B0016Q2D5M|1.0|After wasting time watching this remake, I was made to appreciate the classic \\"Journey to the Center of the Earth\\". The 1959 version with it's comically outdated \\"special\\" effects and corny acting and dialog I was made to appreciate at least for the \\"gravitas\\" and dread that movie was so infused with. As a kid it was kinda heavy. You feel like your embarking on a very dangerous expedition. Which makes sense considering your going to the center of the Earth (although of course that is all that is sensible about this fantasy story). But if you do a story about people going through the Earth and repeatedly almost being killed you want to convey the emotion of people being terrified to death. Remember the music from the old movie? And the duck? No duck in this one. And no dread. Just a silly, mostly lighthearted second rate cgi roller coaster ride that isn't worth the price of a ticket.
B001UREJWM|5.0|I'm not going to make you read a novel about why you should pick up this cd. The simple fact is this, if it sounds like Sabbath and has members from Sabbath, it's Sabbath. No disrepect to the ladz here and they can call it Heaven & Hell if they want to, however for me it's Black Sabbath!!<br /><br />Anyway, if you love any of the Dio fronted Sabbath years, you have to pick this up. It's just as good or better than anything else these guys have done together. This cd is brilliant at times and truly is a must have for any Sabbath fan.<br /><br />Get it now!!
B001QOOCTE|5.0|With musicians from all over the world, a different blend of music, a different blend of inspiration arouses us all. Playing a classic tunes and music, it's hard not to become inspired to do more in our lives. To seek change and make the most out of our lives. Living day to day with new goals in mind. Living day to day giving people hugs and making people laugh is what this album makes me want to do. With all our differences, this album, through music and love, can make us realize we are all alike. We are all human and we are all family. So support and change the world. It's the only one we got.
0375826726|5.0|I loved the book! it had great plot! great dialog! it has a very good ending and it makes you want to get the forth book when it comes out! i would rate this book 9.5 out of 10! another thing i like is that it is over 800 pages! this book is a insane book for all ages! i would highly recomend it to anny one! FYI I am (13) :)
B0010YSD7M|5.0|This is a film about the last season of Stargate sg-1. In the film they found an object which may give them an advantage against the Ori, however someone on the goverment isn't truly convinced, so they a plan of their own.    While some people wanted to have a 11th season of stargate, for me at least give it a good, convencing finale, trust me when i say this They did not dissapoint in every way.
B000002LOE|5.0|When I first bought this album, I thought it was interesting and a bit odd. After finding it again years later, I was amazed at the uniqueness and diversity of the sound as well as the overall high song quality. It is a very moving album that vividly paints a wide variety emotions.    The only weakness on the entire album is the first song: Radio Song. I just don't care for it.

0312360266|5.0|The House of Night series throws are love for vampires in with the modern world. In the story humans know about the vampires and live beside if not separate from. I love how the authors use people like Kenny Chesney, modernizing the books so that young adults can relate. I personally loved Zoey and felt like I had known her my whole life. There is plenty of action, drama, and romance. As Zoey discoverers this new world of vampires we discover it with her.
0316044695|5.0|Very moving and suspenseful.  The first half is a must read and gives amazing insight to what it takes to become a Navy Seal.  The second half goes into great detail of the horrors of war.  Very well written and will open your eyes to what is happening in Afghanistan.  Marcus is an amazing person with an even more amazing story of strength and survival.
B000ZN802W|5.0|It is very easy to take this film, and this true story too literally and at face value, and miss the point. Taking in to account so much of the dialogue and the type of things that are highlighted, it becomes clear what the film-maker is trying to convey. This story is all about exposing what social consciousness means (think social pressure and constraints), it's insipid power and stranglehold. As well as it's demand for blindness and dishonesty. And an example of how much it takes to attempt to escape it. The only real tragedy in this film is the length to which a young man felt compelled to go, in order to escape our prison planet. The point of this film is to see and understand why he felt so compelled. It's not so much about the what,... but the why. The vast majority of us can't even hope to escape this invisible power. The best we can do is to become aware of it, and awareness leads to change. Just a super job. I've never seen anything else quite like it.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I was introduced to Mark last week, and got to see \\"Stand By Me\\" on a huge screen with about 1500 people watching. Everyone there was a video editor, and EVERYONE was truly amazed at the impact this project is having on Peace through music. Yet another one of those \\" Why didn't I think of that? \\" moments. Excellent music and video. My hats off to Mark and his crew. This project will surely grow and have a major impact on the people who see and experience it.
B001TH16DS|5.0|It's taken more than 40 years, but I think this is a contender for \\"best edition of classic Star Trek ever.\\" I'm too young to have seen the original broadcast run, but I have fond memories of WVIA PBS TV running 3 gorgeous restored, uncut episodes back to back every Saturday night without commercials. These prints were from the original 35mm masters, which were the source for these new discs.<br /><br />Until now, I considered my VHS recordings of those broadcasts about as good as any commercial product out there. Prior sets were either prohibitively expensive (the VHS sets, the later DVD sets), obnoxiously collected (2 episodes per 1 disc in a standard amray case?), or endangered species (HD-DVD? I don't think so).<br /><br />The series is still syndicated on cable TV, but it's typically hacked up to make space for commercials, annoyingly running for 90 minutes because of the extra filler. As I write this, Netflix has this same first season (featuring remastered visuals) on it's instant streaming service, and that's very convenient. The streaming version has sub-DVD picture quality and no extra content, so it really can't compare to this new set.<br /><br />This blu-ray set is everything my late-night PBS marathons were and more. Gorgeous color saturation, no visual noise, a wonderful new surround sound mix, sensible pricing, and tons of documentary extras. By far my favorite feature is the seamless branching that allows you to press the ANGLE button on your bluray remote to switch between the original janky special effects, and the remastered effects that blend surprisingly well. I can't overemphasize how well the new visuals blend into the show -- they aren't overly flashy, and they don't mess with the original timing or sound. It's as if the screen is finally showing what you had in your imagination all along, only hampered by inferior TV resolution until now.<br /><br />I'm thrilled to have such a high quality rendition of this great old show. This presentation significantly raises the standard for other collections to follow. I hope seasons 2 and 3 look as good as Season 1.dard for other collections to follow. I hope seasons 2 and 3 look as good as Season 1.
1439138311|3.0|Themes and settings strike a chord of nostalgia, and this is a pleasant enough book for a train journey or day at the beach. It is a very slow moving book, especially in the beginning, which seems rather a clich&eacute; - and even the later action is rather tedious. I felt I 'knew' every character, and I'm sure many readers will be reminded of others, but there did not seem to be anything of particular distinction or depth.<br /><br />Based on other new books I have reviewed recently, this may be a trend in editing rather than an author's weakness, but the language lacks maturity and beauty. It reminds me of the vocabulary and structure from books which used to be aimed at children of twelve.<br /><br />Overall, it is a worthwhile book for relaxation and warmth, but I did not find any elements to be of special note.

031606792X|4.0|Ok, I admit that I read some of the 1 star reviews before I bought the book and almost didn't buy it.  However, remembering that I hardly ever agree with the critics I bought the book and with a sigh of relief it wasn't as bad as some people said it was.      I guess people forget this is \\"fantasy/fiction\\" and maybe those same people don't like the Underworld series either (speaking of vampire/werewolf hybrid). SPOILER:  For once one of the main characters didn't have to die; what's wrong with happy endings?  You want reality, flip on the news!      I liked the book; it wasn't the best out of the series (the whole Jacob/Nessie thing got a little annoying) but certainly not the dreadful book a lot of people made it out to be.  For those who don't like happy endings read \\"Of Mice and Men\\".

B001FBSMW6|5.0|I am blown away once again by Keane! I've only had Perfect Symmetry for a week and continue queuing it up in my various devices - track by track, shuffled or not (and it took me an embarrassingly long 6 months to get it - some things just come into your life in their own time). Each day another amazing track takes center stage. It only really took 1-2 listens for it to grab me - maybe even faster than Iron Sea did. I am a HUGE fan of their first 2 brilliant melancholy & introspective outings and yet would not or should not expect them to re-visit those milestones in the same way with the same results. What fun would this be? In fact, if they did Hopes & Fears Vol. 2 right now, although many of us would unconsciously be hooked and praise the band & the heavens, in the end we would be robbed of seeing a gifted band progress and honor their own gift, and by way of that, ultimately let down their fans. As a student of music mainly from the 60's onward, I have learned to appreciate the artist's journey and reward this progression with my loyalty. Their work here is fun, uplifting yet complex, sonically fascinating and by many turns wholly original even when it can be easy to call some if it retro 80's. I just love feeling their continued passion, experimentation, guts, imperfections, perfection, unique arrangement choices, fresh writing, more mature lyrics and of course Tom's powerful tenor coupled with Tim's fierce piano work...and those pop hooks, still there. And here's another angle - have you gone back to check out the first 2 albums after getting lost in this one and felt how refreshing they can sound again? Then hop back to this set for something else different yet again? This is what will stand over time - the work will sit right alongside what's come before and hopefully after, and provide perfect complimentary experiences for us. What a gift....and Perfect Symmetry indeed! I can't wait to see them perform next week in the SF Bay Area - these new tunes will rock! Thank you Keane for following your hearts and doing something new so that our Keane playlists always entertain & move us. May Keane live on....
B001GKJ2DY|4.0|Hmm...will you like this video?<br /><br />Here's a quiz:<br />1) Are you a fan of ABBA?<br />2) Do you like movie musicals?<br />3) Do you like romantic comedies?<br />4) Do you like Meryl Streep, Pierce Brosnan, Colin Firth, Stellan Skarsgard, and/or some combination thereof?<br /><br />Here are the results:<br />1) If you can't stand the music of ABBA, move on...skip this movie, do not buy, (also do not pass \\"GO\\" do not collect $200).<br />2) If you answered YES to question #1 and at least one of the other questions, add this DVD to your collection.  You will watch it occasionaly, and enjoy it thoroughly each time.<br />3) If you answered YES to at least two of the other questions, you MUST get this DVD.  You will love it, and you will most likely watch it repeatedly.<br /><br />I found this movie to be great fun!  ABBA was at their apex of popularity when I was in college, and hearing this music brought back fun memories.  I thought that the director, writers, choreographers, and sound engineers did a grand job of synchronizing the music, dance, and storyline.<br /><br />The setting for the film is exotic.  The storyline is interesting, and the acting is engaging and fun.  The singing is good for the most part, though my HS aged drama-choir kids seem to gain a sort of pleasure from mocking Pierce Brosnan's solos.  Granted, his solos are probably the weakest link in the show.  On the other hand, I loved it when Meryl Streep's character and her two best friends sang at her daughter's bachelorette party.<br /><br />The story is almost melodramatic, and the main characters pull off their roles well.  The music and dancing is fun, and if you enjoy that sort of thing, then you will definitely enjoy this show<br /><br />4 stars!  \\"Thank you for the music\\"!

0380799006|2.0|This book is by the same people who wrote How to Talk So Kids Will Listen... It offers practical advice which sounds so reasonable but didn't really help my family when put into use. My girls are almost 9 and 5 1/2. They fight and compete constantly for my attention.  I diligently tried the advice in this book but to not avail. Just didn't translate to real life, or maybe its just us!
0316789798|5.0|I bought this for my 7 year old nephew but I've had just as much fun with it. There's a wide variety of animals and creatures in the book with patient, step-by-step how-to-draw illustrations for each. There are easy bugs and birds and then more difficult dragons so there's room to practice and grow. Children love how-to-draw books and this is one of the best I've seen. Highly recommended for a lot of creative fun!
0634049011|5.0|I got my first guitar only about six months ago.  In the time I've had it, I've bought more guitar books than I should have.  But I've learned more from this one book than from all the other books combined.  I think Barrett Tagliarino is not only a great guitarist; he's also a great teacher.  I find that just from reading this book and working the exercises in it, I understand a lot more about the fretboard and what I'm doing when I play than a lot of people who have been studying much longer.  I plan to buy and work my way through every book Barrett Tagliarino has written.

B001PPF126|4.0|This double CD package is an excellent value with a staggering 21 B-sides + bonus/live songs on the 2nd disc. Many of the songs on disc 2 are absolutely essential if you like Radiohead and want to hear more of their material from the mid 90's. These are not mere leftovers either. Disc two stands up well on it's own and in some ways is more interesting to listen to now than the original album.    This is an excellent opportunity to get most of the songs available on various single and releases from this era, some of which might be hard to find now. I would rate the Bends itself as a solid 4 star CD. Perhaps with all these extras this would have been a 5 star worthy purchase. I feel obliged to only give 4 stars because the original album could have been remastered for this release, and was not.
B001TH16DS|5.0|Eagerly awaited this blu-ray set for a long time ever since the originals came out as HD/DVD and then just regular DVD sets. There's not much else one can say other than for $64.99 at the moment of writing this it's too good to pass up. My only complaint so far is probably due to my own lack of understanding or owning a HD TV but for some reason my picture is stuck in a box. It's black bars all around making the image a box and not stretched to fit the screen let alone in widescreen. Is there a way to watch it without this way or was this just how these were made?

0375707972|4.0|With the first part of the story, I felt that it did an excellent job intriguing the reader. Some of the reviews see this as a love story or one of pedophilia, but I don't really think either of these views are correct. What Hanna did was pedophilia but I do not think this was the focus. In the same instance, I do not think Hanna ever really loved him. It was about the boy's love and devotion to her. I found that the writing for the court room scene was a little much. What he wrote could have been cut down in half. He continually wrote on how her neck tensed or what her body language was for pages on end, when we just could have heard the story of the victims and the trial. At first I did not like the ending, but after thinking about it I changed my mind. Sometimes we hold on to memories because we don't want to think any different of how things can be, and the reality of change can really frighten us. It was kind of like the Great Gatsby where he wanted to hold on to this image that was just not true. I think the beggining is great, the middle is a little bland, and the ending really makes you think.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|this version of the great austin novel is an absolute disaster; one star rating is too much, i wish i could give it less; it could possibly be considered as a very bad parody on pride and prejudice;   worst of all were keira knightley's scary grins and mr bingley's clown face; the rest of the cast was just plain bad; i even felt sorry to see judi dench appear in such a bad movie;   everything was wrong in it; really unwatchable!
030014332X|2.0|Misleading title. Its just a history of Europe. That why it fails. Great civilizations / countries like China, Japan, India , North America, South America and even Russia are ignored or dismissed in a few lines. Looks like the author was actually living in the middle ages. He seems to have little idea that there was a big world beyond the boundaries of the European continent. A few chapters on the rest of the world would have helped. Keeping this aspect aside, the book is OK. Easy to read. Easier to forget.

B001N18HOQ|5.0|Don't listen to the magazine review that tells you the 'Ten Deluxe Edition' is only for die-hard fans. Don't listen to that one friend of yours who threw away his iPod because he suddenly discovered the \\"integrity\\" of LPs and who told you that the Deluxe Ed. is Pearl Jam selling-out on the same day he ordered the 'Drop In The Park' LP with same day shipping.    Truth is, the Deluxe Edition is as important to the Pearl Jam listening experience as the 'With the Lights Out' box set is to the Nirvana listening experience: like behind-the-scene cuts in a much-loved movie, it gives you liner notes in sound bytes, sonic history for songs you grew up with in the 90's and now know so well you vocally reproduce McCready's \\"Evenflow\\" solo from the original album every time it plays on the radio.    The remastered Ten is smoother, the transitions less spacey. You can actually hear the guitar solos clearly this time around, without needing to turn up the volume at important parts. \\"Why Go\\" is finally, FINALLY, as loud as it was meant to be. You can delete the older version off your portable music device now.    The Ten Remixes blew my mind away and half an ear-drum. Not going to get into the loudness issue; fact is, Eddie's lyrics for all 11 songs are heard clearer than ever before. Apart from certain concert outtakes, this is the one time your ears will have multiple orgasms over McCready and Gossard's guitar work. \\"Breathe & Scream\\" and \\"Just a Girl\\" are nostalgia trips, because its pure early 90's sound. \\"2,000 mile Blues\\" is a track that makes me wish that Pearl Jam puts out a blues EP at some point, if only to mess with all our heads. McCready has tonnes of fun with that track, and it's definitely worth the listen. \\"Evil Little Goat\\" sounds like Elvis meets Mark Arm over too much grain alcohol. Seriously. I still do prefer the original version of \\"Black\\": it's darker, more sober, and a little more subtle than the robust sound of O'Brien's remix.     Favorites on this cd?  1. \\"Brother\\"  2. \\"Garden\\"  3. \\"Porch\\"  4. \\"State of Love and Trust\\" (when it's slower, it's better.)    And we finally get a bonafide DVD copy of the unplugged show! Without them pesky time/date stamp numbers and fuzzy lines that appeared in every Youtube clip of that show! Never again. And we should all be thankful. Sure, this deluxe edition could be just a marketing maneuver. But when the sound quality is this good, frankly, I don't give a [...].

B001TOD92C|3.0|As a fan of pro wrestling, and as a fan of a comeback story, I really had high expectations for this film.  Sad to say, I came away angry and disappointed.<br /><br />The only reason this film works at all is because of the amazing performance of Mickey Rourke.  Mickey pours his heart and soul into Randy \\"the Ram\\" Robinson.  He fills his performance with pathos, sadness, intensity, pity, and just about everything he has.  I can't think of no other actor who could really do this role and do it so well.  Even though the dialog is boring, Rourke manages to elevate it into something meaningful.  Reportedly, Nicholas Cage was originally slated to play Randy the Ram, but he pulled out of the production.  Cage is a decent actor, but he couldn't do what Rourke has done here.  Rourke has been through a ton of crap in his life, and that pathos comes through brilliantly in this performance.  Even though Mickey made a comeback a few years ago in Sin City (actually, he gave the best performance in that movie), this is his real comeback, and I hope it sticks, because he's really a great actor who has his respect back, and he deserves it.<br /><br />Aside from Rourke's amazing, heartfelt performance, this film is actually pretty awful.  The script is extremely trite, filled with boring dialog, cliched situations, no narrative flow whatsoever, and the only scenes that had any real life to them were the one in the bar when Mickey and Marisa have a beer, and one scene where Mickey is having fun with some customers while he works at the deli.  These scenes feel like they were improvised by the actors, and if that was true, I wish they had improvised the whole thing.  I was actually bored a lot of the time, which to me was amazing, considering the film had great potential.<br /><br />Marisa Tormei, a great actress in her own right, does what she can with the underwritten material.  However, most of the other parts are very one note (especially Mickey's manager at the supermarket, played rather snidely by comedian Todd Barry), and nothing really resonates at all in this film.

The matches may be predetermined, but those wrestlers are putting themselves through a lot of pain.  The hardcore match that Mickey is in is brutal and extreme, but isn't as bad as some of the actual hardcore matches out there (the man who Mickey wrestles in this scene is Necro Butcher, an actual hardcore wrestler in CZW (Combat Zone Wrestling), which gets a plug in this film).

B001K3JF7K|3.0|I have many of her CD's and although I like the songs on this one it doesn't really seem to be the same caliber as some of her earlier ones.  Don't get me wrong it isn't a bad CD it just either my music taste has changed or something in her has changed.  Somehow I don't think my music tastes have changed since I am in my mid 50's.

B00004CZVT|5.0|When, o when, will the industry respond to the customer's wishes !  I have wanted this movies for ages and almost ordered it.  Then I read the reviews and  found it was not the Masterpiece Theatre version.  A while back I bought a region free Sony player so I could enjoy things like this.  Now they are zapping us again.  Another dirty trick they are playing is selling \\"region enhanced\\"  which nullifies the  usefulness of our new region free players.  What Crooks--they are ripping off the public.

B001K3JF7K|2.0|I'm puzzled by this effort from Diana. She seems to have dismayed her fans and maybe not quite calculated accurately how this one would come off.  Claus Ogerman is a genius arranger but I believe he was a bit over indulgent on this one.  The song selection had no real cohesive body and the ballads seemed repetitious with no real emotional appeal. I didn't feel it was her best bossa nova or ballad interpretations nor was the production very well thought out. I kept feeling that this was a forced project to satisfy a contract.  Diana seems to need stimulus in the way of other capable musicians around her in order to feel sparked and fresh.  The selections on \\"Quiet Nights\\" seems a bit tiresome and unauthentic.  If you're going to do bossa nova you'd better be believable and be able to pull it off without Brazilian musicians other wise people who live this kind of music will eat you for breakfast. Case in point Eliane Elias' Bossa Nova Stories.  Diana should stick to what she does best, Swingin and Ballads with the help of her great band.
B001UREJWM|5.0|Obviously the dude from Ohio never heard of Ronnie James Dio.  Read his review and the bands he likes.  His taste in music stinks just like his football team.  I remember Carson Palmer rolling on the field in pain after Kimo sacked him.  Then the Steelers won their 5th Superbowl.   I'd be ashamed to admit I listened to Limp Bizkit, watched the Bungals, and didn't know of Ronnie James Dio.  That Bungal fan probably doesn't even own a Black Sabbath album with Ozzy.   HERE WE GO STEELERS!!  I bet he heard of that cheer in Cincy.
B001UREJWM|5.0|Hey hey people, whats good??  I am a lifelong metal fan, I've been into the scene since way back in 2001 when I seen Limp Bizkit do \\"Rollin'\\" on MTB Cribs!!  Well knowing all that, a friend of mine said I should check out the new Black Sabbath album which is released 4 some reason under the name Heaven N Hell!!  Having not been familiar with Sabbath (their not played on MTV or VH1 so they can't be THAT great) I decided to give it a chance since I know it was a band Ozzy use to be with in his early demo days!!  Well I was sooo disappointed with this lazy, brooding music as a first impression, it seemed to be going nowhere fast!!  Then the worst thing happened, the singer started to come in and wail WAY off key, I thought to myself this can't be Ozzy, as the vokals sounded nothing like Ozzy's on his awesome \\"Black Rain\\" and \\"Down To Earth\\" albums!!  It was some funny guy I never herd of called Ronnie Janes Dio!!  What a letdown, they need to get Ozzy back if they expect to go anywhere!!  I do give this album a few stars cuz the cover is pretty cool with some neat colors and I also like the drumber's snare sound.  For good metal, check into Limp Bizzkit, Linkin Park, KoRn, Staind, Disturbed, Mudvayne, Nickleback, Puddle Of Mudd, Theory Of A Deadman and the aggressive as heck All American Rejects!!  Go Bengals, Carson Palmer, Chad Johnson and Cedrick Benson are footballs MVP's!!

B000I2J6K0|5.0|This dvd is a great combination of light cardio and a really good lower body workout.  I would recommend it to anyone who is expecting.  It's great because she moves quickly through the exercises so you don't feel like you're wasting time setting up and listening to long explanations.  And even though she moves quickly, it's easy to catch on and learn the exercises.  I think it's good to pair this dvd with one that has a decent upper body workout as Erin's focus isn't so much on that but all in all, definitely a great buy!
0061122416|4.0|For several months, I was going through a slump in my life, and I lacked the motivation necessary to seriously pursue my goals.  A number of people and experiences pushed me out of the slump, and this book helped a little as well, compelling me to focus on what I should be doing with my life.  Granted, this book only inspired me a little, and it didn't have a profound impact on me.  But I give it credit for the small but important effect it had.<br /><br />So don't expect this book to change your life, or to inspire you to greatness.  But you can hope that it might have a positive impact.<br /><br />That said, a number of reviewers have criticized this book for its simplicity (both in writing style and message), repetition of points, and lack of sophistication.  These reviewers make solid points;  if you want a book with complex syntax, lots of descriptive content, and a morality lesson that requires work to decipher, then you should look elsewhere.  If you want to read something comprehensive, this book is not for you.  Fortunately, none of these \\"problems\\" weighed too heavily on me.<br /><br />The best criticism I've read suggests that this book doesn't say anything many readers won't already know.  Still, while you might already know this books' message, it might still be positive or helpful to hear it again, or to see it described in a brand new light.  I knew the message, and it still helped me.<br /><br />For my own part, I'm amazed by how poorly I remember the book's characters.  I finished reading the book several weeks ago, and, while I remember its story, and I'm grateful for its impact on me, I can't call many of its images to mind.  Typically, after reading a novel, I can call its images to my mind for months.  With my favorite books, the vividness of these images never fades;  years later, I can clearly recall certain scenes at will.  But, it is now clear, this book just hasn't stuck with me.<br /><br />Overall - this book was simple and helpful, but just didn't stick with me.
B001N18HOQ|1.0|What is down??  First off I love grunge rock, its dark brooding power cords define my tortured life and I love playing it on a sunny day while I golf with friends at the country club.  Anyhoo, a friend told me I shood check out Pearl Jam and said I should play their new one they just putt out with a dvd called \\"10\\".  Wow, this was nothing like the good grunge bands, the singer is indescipherable, the guitarists play no good memorable rifts, and the drumber is just hitting old peanut butter cans, gross!!  LOOK People, stick with TRU grunge bands, you know bands like Puddle Of Mudd, Nickleback, Theory Of A Deadman, 3 Days Grace, Default and Mudvayne.  Go Bengals, 2009 Football Champs, Who-Dey!!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love the 30 Day Shred! I was already in good basic shape from doing Tae Bo, but the 30 Day Shred has been a real challenge! I am now on level 3 and its still an excellent, very challenging workout. Haven't exactly lost a ton of weight on it, but perhaps that's because I didn't really have much to lose. In the past month my muscles have become more defined and MUCH stronger. My body is more buff which I just love. My pants are hanging looser, and I feel more confident when wearing a tank top. This DVD was definitely worth the money. I combine the workout daily with an hour of walking for a little extra cardio and do it 4 days a week, on off days I do Tae Bo 1-2 days a week and take 1 day off.  I am feeling healthier and stronger than I have in my whole life.
0553385461|5.0|I knew Stephen Hawkins from his scientific reputation, a physicist of international renown, who prevailed over serious illness most of his life.  This did nor inhibit him from exercising his brilliant mind to the full.  I was NOT disappointed by his latest book, an up-to-date version of his much earlier treatise \\" A Brief History of Time.\\" A succinct, easy to understand book on a very difficult subject.  Michael V. Lock.
B001K3JF7K|3.0|I enjoy covers of the classics in \\"The Great American Songbook\\" as much as anyone. But, I like to hear them sung NOT breathed. Over produced, saccharine,and unsatisfying. Wonderful selection of songs. Diana, however, does each in an overly dramatic and throaty, oh-so-breathy manner that it was hard to listen to.
B000002H6C|1.0|Hey hey whats good people??  I have been into Metallica longer than anyone I know, I got into them back in June 2003 when StAnger was dropped into an unsuspecting dull scene and set the world of music afire!!  They soon had an MTV special dedicated to them as video pioneers where legendary metal bands like Sum 41, Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park played awesome versions of Metalica classiks that were better tan the originals!!  Well after enjoying StAnger so much I decided to look back into their classic hits and came across this album.  Wow, wha a mistake, they thought it was a good idea to let Kirk do these high pitched wails on his guitar, StAnger had none of this, James' lyrics are weird and I don't understand what they mean, Lars sounds like he's playing on cardboard boxes and not garbage cans, and worst of all is Rob's bass, its mixed wayyyyy too loud and overpowers the guitars and keyboards!!  For good metal, just stick with StAnger, Limp Bizkit, KoRn, Linkin Park, Disturbed, Nickleback, Staind, Puddle Of Mudd, Atreyu, Mudvayne, Kidd Rokk, Drowning Pool and the All American Rejects!!  Go Bengals, we are all Bengals fans and will see them at the Superbowl!!
B000TM1CKQ|4.0|I pretty much avoided CBS sitcoms. Scrubs, Arrested Development, 30 Rock, that's what I liked. They seemed all non-typical and when looking at the string of Monday night shows on CBS they appeared to be so pedestrian. I realize that might make me sound like a jerk, but that's fine. I might be a jerk.<br /><br />I had been prodded by several groups of friends for a long time to watch How I Met Your Mother. \\"You should watch\\" was usually followed by, \\"You're exactly like Barney.\\" Barney is played by Neil Patrick Harris, and while I appreciate being compared to TV royalty like His Doogie-ness, I still wasn't buying it.<br /><br />With a string of fantastically funny movies turned in by Jason Segel and a rekindled love affair with Freaks and Geeks, I thought \\"Why not? If I don't like it, I can blame my friends for years to come.\\"<br /><br />So, I purchased season one. It took several episodes to hone in on the pace of the show. It seemed very set-up-set-up-joke-laugh-track, exactly what I don't like. The main character, Ted, was very Ross Gellar-ish, which is to say whiny and annoying. However, not so distasteful that I immediately ejected the disc and burned in the microwave.<br /><br />It was good to see Alyson Hannigan emerge from Buffy into a more widely palatable show. She deserved it. And Cobie Smulders was attractive enough to pique my interest. I think she even had lines at some point.<br /><br />Once the show was set, around episode four or five and it was a fully baked How I Met Your Mother pie, I started to enjoy it. I caught myself laughing. It is pleasant and harmless, good humored and endearing. It out friended Friends. Ted's march toward true love was accessible and his hope kindled a small flame in my long-dead, cold heart. I liked it. Season one was quickly followed by purchases of two and three and being stuck wringing my hands waiting on season four.<br /><br />Though, the comparisons to Barney started to sting. He's a jerk. Oh wait, I'm a jerk. Yet, he's a womanizer and a cad. I'm not that. I might like to be, but I'm not. Is that what my friends thought of me? In later episodes and later seasons they peel back the curtain on Barney. I breathed a sigh of relief. My friends didn't hate me. He's a truer person than that. He cares about his friends, but will rarely show it. OK, I'll accept that. I could be that guy.<br /><br />And that's how I met How I Met Your Mother.t like to be, but I'm not.

B001UREJWM|2.0|Having seen Black Sabbath/Heaven and Hell in 81,92 and 2006 I can tell you I am a huge long time fan. I came into this album with great expectations even after hearing the slightly disappointing Bible Black single in advance of the CD. Atom and Evil opens the CD with a slow plodding dirge with Dio singing nonsensical lyrics. This continues for ten consecutive songs with very little variation. Eating the Cannibals picks up the pace  but Dios lyrics are abysmal. The sad thing about this record is it lacks any truly great riffs from Tony Iommi. Vinny Appice's drumming  is also a disappointment as virtually every song is the same tempo. The album is well produced and grows on you the more you hear it but there is not a single song that holds up to anything off of Heaven and Hell, Mob Rules or Dehumanizer.
B000WPAG1Q|5.0|The sole purpose of me buying this DVD was because I actually went to this tour show 2 years ago...in BMORE...and it was AWESOME!!!!!Christina has an amazing voice...and I will tell anyone to purchase this DVD but if you ever get a chance to see her live...GO....Hearing her live is amazing...she has such a powerful voice and that is why besides Beyonce she is in my top 5 singers of all times right now
B000002J03|1.0|Whats good people!!  I love rock, get that into your head first, when I turn on the radio I expect to here good nu metal and nu rock bands but all they play is stupid old hippie rock that was made in the 70's and 80's like this!!  The singer just wails like a girl, the guitarist plays random notes that don't flow naturally, the bass player is a little better than the guitarist, but thats not saying much, the drummer is the worst of all, he plays lazy and his drums are too loud in the mixx.  The worst part is the lyrix, who would write songs about lemons, livin' lovin' maids and dumb books like \\"Moby Dick\\" they forced you to reed in collidge??  For good rock look into the reunited Creed, metal gods Limp Bizkit, emotional yet brutal rockers Lincoln Park, grunge gods Puddle Of Mudd, Nickleback, Theory Of A Deadman and Mudvayne, punk rockers All American Rejects and Blink 182, and hip hop legends Soulja Boi, 50 Cent, T Pain and Lil Wayne.  Led Zeppelin is going nowhere and will never be on MTV!!  Go Bengals, Who Dey!!
0609610570|1.0|This book reads like an extremely long blog entry.  It's not a terrible read, but if you're looking for a book that contains ideas to improve your management skills or the overall management environment, this is not your book.  The book spends its entire tenure describing WHY execution is important but never delves into HOW to improve execution in an organization.
0962477060|2.0|Ok, so lets make this clear that this is not a theory book and is no substitute for music theory. This book will not teach you how to play music it will only teach you fingerings for navigating the fretboard. That said i think that this is a great reference book for players that have already had some theory/guitar lessons. However there are some things that are not very well explained. For instance there are actually 12 fingerings for scales not 5 because there are 12 notes in the musical system and that may confuse beginning guitar players. The fingerings represented are fingering with the least finger shifts and ones that do not overlap. Without fingerings that over lap (however complicated they may be) it might be hard for a beginner to transition from one pattern to the next and understand how to actually create and smoothly transition without the lead patterns.Lead patterns are kind of like cheap tricks to stay in key. As i said a great reference book, but not for the beginner. I personally prefer scotty west videos as they have helped me greatly in understanding not only theory but the fretboard as well.
B000LPS47U|4.0|Herbert West is no ordinary doctor. He's brilliant and obviously knows quite a bit about the field of medicine, but something is peculiar about him. He acts strangely and tends to keep to himself while getting absorbed into his work. Throughout his research, Dr. West may have finally perfected his serum. A serum that brings the dead back to life. The consequences of the serum are hectic, as expected. The sooner the serum is injected into a fresh corpse in comparison to one that's been lying around for a few hours, the better the results. Based on the H.P. Lovecraft tale, Herbert West-Reanimator, West finds himself at a medical college when his stint in Switzerland ends a bit abruptly. There he meets Dan Cain, a student at the college who is held in high regard, and Dan's girlfriend, Meg, whose father is the dean to the medical college. When Dan puts a notice up looking for a roommate in his dorm, West comes knocking. Things seem to be a constant downward spiral from there as West continues his research and the bodies begin to pile up.<br /><br />Re-Animator is one of the few cult classics that I'll stick up for. I usually wind up feeling like most classic horror films that are recommended or held in such high regard aren't good at all or are extremely overrated. This film is a lot of fun though. It's definitely got its campy qualities with a headless corpse stumbling around the third act of the film, but it doesn't feel out of place for a film built around a concoction that's injected into the brain to bring corpses back from the dead. The music, especially the opening theme, tends to get a bad wrap because it blatantly rips off (or pays homage, depending on how you look at it) the Psycho score. While the similarities are crystal clear once they're heard, I honestly didn't mind it. It's kind of hard to imagine this film with different music, so I have no complaints.<br /><br />The Herbert West role really fits Jeffrey Combs like a glove. His attraction to weird and quirky roles pretty much began with films like this one. As West's unusual personality is revealed throughout the film, you can't help but get a sense of uneasiness as his character traits unravel before your very eyes. The best example is when West brings Dan's cat Rufus back to life. After it's been killed for the second time, Dan is shocked to discover it's Rufus and turns to look at West. West points at the cat and tells Dan to, \\"Look out!\\" Dan quickly turns his attention back to poor Rufus, who's still lying there motionless. West begins to burst into maniacal laughter as Dan looks on in horror. With the upcoming remake on the horizon, it's hard to imagine anyone else in the role of Herbert West especially with Jeffrey Combs confirmed for a cameo.<br /><br />While Re-Animator could definitely be considered cheesy and campy at times, its strengths outweigh its flaws. The story is simple, but tends to unfold nicely and the acting is solid (David Gale as Dr. Hill is up for debate though). The film is pretty much exactly what you would expect a horror film to be like from the eighties; gory, cheesy, tons of nudity and sex, and a few creative twists along the way. And when it comes to horror, what else could you really ask for?<br /><br />Rating: 7.5/10etty much began with films like this one.

B0012GN0JE|2.0|This album is my least favorite from Jeff Beck. I bought the album when it first came out. I played it maybe 5 times and stashed it away in my lp storage area. I did not even record it to cassette. It is still in great shape. I liked the guitar but the extra chessy vocals killed me. People Get Ready is the best song by far on it.  There was a music video of it that made the rounds on MTV back in the day. You can buy the song on Best of Jeff Beck Cd and get it on there with a lot of other good Jeff Beck.  Maybe some day I will bring it out again and see if it was as bad as I remember. Now saying that. This not so good Jeff beck LP is better than most any thing else out now days.
B001IAOEXU|5.0|As others have stated, these work perfectly.  I think they make the controller feel better and more comfortable.  They really came in handy on HAWX, as it is useful to have a finger on each R1, R2, L1, L2 buttons for that particular game.  Most of the time, I just use a single finger for either R1/R2 or L1/L2.  At the price, I don't think you can really go wrong with these.
B001ILFUDM|5.0|Pinocchio is feast for the eyes and the ears. The animation is the most perfect one that I've seen in any animated movie. The characters are animated in a wonderful way and the backgrounds are just stunning. The story is great and unlike many would think, Pinocchio is a dark movie, a thing that I found even better because is not a \\"kid movie\\", is also for adults and that makes it more interesting.<br /><br />Is amazing to think that this one was Disney's second film. The progress made between Snow White and Pinocchio is very apparent and it shows in the whole movie. The animator's work is masterful and in every area of production the movie excels. Not many films have stood the test of time but Pinocchio has done it wonderfully and is safe to call it a true classic.<br /><br />Pinocchio was the last Platinum Edition and the second to come to BD and the results are truly breathtaking!<br /><br />Video & Audio<br />Pinocchio has been given a lavish restoration and the results are simply amazing. Detail is perfectly delineated, color reproduction is spot on and the overall image is clean, without any annoying artifacting. A truly marvelous job done by Disney.<br /><br />Audio is not as effective but that is mainly because of the soundtrack's age more than for Disney's excellet efforts. The 7.1 DTS-HD MA is not very envolving but is clean, clear and gets the job done. There is no fake gimmicky to be found. A restored monaural soundtrack is also offered.<br /><br />Bonus Material<br />This is a 2-BD set that comes jam-packed with bonus material that makes your appreciation and love for this movie even bigger.<br /><br />In disc 1 you have a Cinema-explore option where some animators and critic Leonard Maltin gives their appreciation of the film via a PIP commentary. You can also just hear them as an audio-commentary by disabling the PIP option although I recommend the homer which is more fun and engaging.<br /><br />You also have a sing-along option where you can select the songs from the movie and sing with them.<br /><br />In Disc 2 you have the excellent making-of documentary: No Strings Attached: The Making of Pinocchio which is a wonderful and informative piece where many people talks about the amazing creation of this film. Is mandatory viewing!<br /><br />You also have more featurettes like games, trailers, galleries, and more that will keep you busy for many hours but everything is great and worth your time.<br /><br />A DVD copy is also included.<br /><br />Closing Thoughts<br />Pinocchio is an unquestionable masterpiece that deserves a spot in every film fan collection.

B001MEJY8W|3.0|As a young girl, Lucie was able to escape certain death as she was held captive and tortured onto the brink of death. Now, fifteen years later, she seeks revenge on those who hurt her emotionally, physically, and mentally. The only person she's ever been close to is, her friend, Anna. As Lucie leaves a path of destruction and mayhem on her quest for revenge, Anna is dragged along to help pick up the pieces. In an odd twist, Lucie is haunted by a woman whose sole purpose is to hurt her, but only shows up after Lucie unleashes all of her built up pain and anger. Anna begins to question Lucie's sanity as things take a turn for the worst. That is until Anna discovers the chained up woman in the basement...<br /><br />Martyrs wasn't really what I was expecting at all. I was expecting something along the lines of Haute Tension and &Agrave; l'int&eacute;rieur since it's classified as a French horror film. I was left with something completely different as Martyrs tends to be on a level all on its own. It is extremely brutal. I've heard it is more along the lines of Irr&eacute;versible, but since I haven't seen that I can't really elaborate on it. It left with me with the same feeling The Girl Next Door did. This uneasiness that made me question sitting through the movie again any time soon. Yet, at the same time, not many horror films are capable of making me feel this way. So I'm not really sure if I should view this as a flaw or a virtue. It also reminded me of Hostel, at times, especially the closing act of the film. Before people grown or anything, let me explain. It reminds me of Hostel if it was done correctly and focused on young girls the entire time. For me, Hostel had an excellent idea but was executed the wrong way. Martyrs pretty much brought what I had in mind for that film to life and did it better. Martyrs is definitely its own film, but its influences and/or homages seem to stick out like a sore thumb to someone who watches a lot of films and/or reviews them.<br /><br />On first viewing, I can't really say if I liked why this was being done to these girls. It is explained and as it makes sense on one hand, it seems a bit farfetched on the other. It may grow on me during repeat viewings, but it didn't really sit well with me this particular time. The brutality in the film isn't always what is shown on screen either. There's a scene where this bulky guy is just beating the snot out of this girl. Just punching her in the face repeatedly as hard as he can. You can't really see the damage he's doing to her, but you can hear it and you can tell he's giving her quite a beating. During one of the more gruesome parts, the sound almost completely fades away and the shot relies completely on the girl's facial expressions as you see her begin to shake. As disturbing as it was, it was interesting seeing anguish portrayed a bit differently as the film went on.<br /><br />Martyrs definitely delivers in more than one department. Those who are looking for another sick, twisted, and brutal French horror film won't be disappointed and let's just say the film lives up to the meaning of its title. While the film is done well and I do plan on owning it, it's not exactly something I can just pop in at any time and watch it. Just be advised that this is probably the most brutal and disturbing French horror film (since Haute Tension anyway) to date. There's plenty of scenes to cringe at and scream at in this film.<br /><br />Rating: 7/10an't really say if I liked why this was being done to these girls. It is explained and as it makes sense on one hand, it seems a bit farfetched on the other. It may grow on me during repeat viewings, but it didn't really sit well with me this particular time. The brutality in the film isn't always what is shown on screen either. There's a scene where this bulky guy is just beating the snot out of this girl. Just punching her in the face repeatedly as hard as he can. You can't really see the damage he's doing to her, but you can hear it and you can tell he's giving her quite a beating. During one of the more gruesome parts, the sound almost completely fades away and the shot relies completely on the girl's facial expressions as you see her begin to shake. As disturbing as it was, it was interesting seeing anguish portrayed a bit differently as the film went on.    Martyrs definitely delivers in more than one department. Those who are looking for another sick, twisted, and brutal French horror film won't be disappointed and let's just say the film lives up to the meaning of its title. While the film is done well and I do plan on owning it, it's not exactly something I can just pop in at any time and watch it. Just be advised that this is probably the most brutal and disturbing French horror film (since Haute Tension anyway) to date. There's plenty of scenes to cringe at and scream at in this film.     Rating: 7/10

B0011WMHRK|4.0|Although unfairly singled out often as Can's best, TM surely remains a high mark for early 70's krautrock recordings, if anything for how out there some of the anti-musical, stream of consciousness sentiment actually gets. Make no mistake though that as self-gratifying as the psychedelic influence can get, a percussive and melodic backbone eventually come in to sweep up all excess debris.
0694003611|1.0|Perhaps I am of the wrong generation to appreciate this book, but I find it rather depressing. The illustrations remain stagnated in another era and the text is dull. We ended up donating our copy to make room for better books on our shelves.
B000002AGE|4.0|4 1/2    Even being as notoriously innovative and influential as they have, HW stands, nearly universally, as Weather Report's most impressively concise work. This '77 mid-career triumph shows the group at a level and consistency of jazz-rock synergy which has yet to be rivaled 30+ years after the fact.
044024367X|1.0|...from \\"Buy it on the first day of release,\\" to, \\"Peruse it at the library first, after I have forgotten the painful disappointment of the last one.\\"    I have never even bothered to read a Lee Child review on Amazon before, because there was never a doubt that I wanted the next book.  What prompted me to finally read the reviews was my grave disappointment and bewilderment.  What happened?!?  Did other Reacher fans feel the same way I did?  What a relief to find out that I am not going crazy, and I am not alone.      So much of what has been written in the negative reviews is dead-on.  Boring story; repeated, implausible behavior on the part of many characters; a total change in Reacher's character.    Instead of being led on an exciting, scary adventure by a tough-as-nails stoic, I felt as though I were back in public school, being led like a child through an anti-war, anti-military, anti-American, anti-Christian political play by a liberal student teacher.    No, my negative review is not motivated by religion, because I am not even Christian, or religious.  But to have the book not-so-subtly draw a moral equivalence between fundamentalist Christians and radical Muslim terrorists was offensive, even to me.    If Lee Child is so desperate to get a movie deal from the lefties in Hollywood, he should have created an entirely new character, not completely sold out a character he had carefully crafted over so many other great books.  The real Jack Reacher died in Nothing to Lose.  I almost hope Lee Child \\"gets religion,\\" and resurrects him.
B000FA57N0|5.0|This is one of the best movies that I've bought.  Check out the series on hulu.  If you like that, you will love this movie.  It exceeded my expectations.  Summer Glau is excellent in this movie.
B001TH16DI|3.0|How do 48 reviews manifest themselves prior to the release date? Huh? Does one view at the studio? Is it an inside thing... buy your Blu-rays from some clandestine get-um prior to release shop? What gives? Curious and confused.
0956010903|5.0|I love the Harry Potter series and this one really completes my collection. Thanks JKR for releasing this piece of the wizarding world to us your fans.
B001PPLJIQ|5.0|The plot of movie is well known and the book is a well regarded masterpiece. Given that, I will focus my review on the cast and the outstanding performances.<br /><br />I got this movie believing that my favorite actor, Ralph Fiennes, would perform the parts of both young and older \\"Michael\\". The discovery of the young star David Kross shinning through as the young Michael only added to the uniqueness of this movie. While every movie Fiennes stars in exceeds my expectations, I'm grateful that Fiennes appearance wasn't prolonged because it gave space for other stars to shine as well.  Simply put, stars are not easily seen in the presence of the sun, and for Fiennes to accept such a small role adds to my certainty that he fell in love with the story and the cast.<br /><br />The movie is not only the story of an unusual love story between a young boy and an older woman, nor a repeated expose about war crimes. Rather, the movie is an unbiased and close observation of the human experience of good, evil, love, rage, loyalty, and unexplained ambivalence.<br /><br />Kate Winslet was born to play Hanna's role, a complex character that is torn between her guilt, morals, passion and insecurities. David Kross, in his first English role, is a talent way beyond his age; an unbelievable gifted young actor who still has so much to give.<br />\\"The Reader\\" is one of the best movies I`ve ever seen, great direction, production, and a well chosen cast (especially Bruno Ganz as professor Rohl who says :\\" there is a difference between law and morality\\").<br />Ignore all the bad reviews accusing Winslet of abusing and corrupting young Michael. If only, these narrow minded people got to be corrupted by Winslet, they might've become more mature men!

B00000JG41|5.0|Mr. Bungle's interpretation of The Golden State is at once familiar and shockingly new. This soulful, dangerous album's finest moments often connote an image of the California portrayed by Brian Wilson and the Beach Boys, but touched by a melancholic madness and sense of confident adventure that sets this apart as an entirely new creation.    So the best tracks - \\"Retrovertigo\\", \\"Pink Cigarette\\" - are genuinely sweet but unsettling, working as impactful, vocal-driven pop, yet at the edges of their composition lurks a twisted subversion that lends them a depth you'll find in few other records. On California Mr. Bungle hones their eclectic chops to precision, creating a record as visionary, scattered and organic as anything this gifted crew (including the venerable Mike Patton) has ever worked on. Oh - and the lyrics are as perfect as any I've seen.    On this, their last and finest album, Mr. Bungle breaks the mold on every track, from the hellfire-tinged cautionary rockabilly number \\"None of Them Knew They Were Robots\\", the funky, creepy \\"Golem II: The Bionic Vapour Boy\\", the steady, cinematic \\"The Holy Filament\\" or the heavy, technical Arab thrash of \\"Ars Moriendi\\". Every track is killer and this album has nary a wasted moment. With so much fine music to consider, I unhesitatingly call this my favorite record of all time.    You want this album - you just don't know it yet.
0451209338|5.0|I really enjoyed The Kill Artist, as I have all of Silva's Gabriel Allon books.  I particularly like how they are extremely believable and the hero is not a perfect, bulletproof character.  The twists and turns are exciting, and the international scenes are adventurous.  And as always, Allon has to battle with his conscience while going about the mission.  I really enjoyed the scenes with the kid Peel to start and end the book as well.
0545128285|5.0|THE TALES OF BEEDLE THE BARD is a collection of 5 Wizarding fairy tales as translated from the ancient runes by Hermione Granger.  Included with each tale is commentary by Hogwarts Headmaster Professor Albus Dumbledore, which was discovered among his personal papers after his untimely and tragic death.  With an introduction by Muggle author J. K. Rowling, who also provides illustrations and footnotes for Muggle readers, THE TALES OF BEEDLE THE BARD is an excellent read for both Wizards and Muggles of all ages.<br /><br />THE TALES OF BEEDLE THE BARD are told to young wizards and witches to teach them right from wrong, good from evil, and to caution against the use Black Magic.  Similar in style and tone to Muggle authors the Brothers Grimm, these tales have not been sugared or watered down.  Wizarding audiences will fondly remember these fairy tales from their childhood, and Muggles will enjoy reading them for the first time.  Additionally, the insights this text provides Muggles into Wizarding life will add clarity and understanding to certain references in the seven volumes which contain the epic story of Harry Potter.<br /><br />THE TALES OF BEEDLE THE BARD is a very enjoyable, quick, and entertaining read which gives non-magical folk a glimpse of the lore and myth of Wizarding history.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this rare treat.  It is not often that Muggles are afforded such a special opportunity.  Secure your copy now, before they all disapparate back to Diagon Alley.
B001RTP48G|4.0|This latest album of Pet Shop Boys, which, like all the others, I bought with the greatest of expectations, is typical of their more recent collections: a few delicious gems in the midst of some cuts that are usually interesting in some way, but faintly tedious. Their last record found them sounding unnerved by the state of the world,but boasted the gorgeous track \\"Luna Park.\\" This one has \\"All Over the World\\" and the undeniably catchy \\"Love etc.\\" Unlike some other fans, I don't like my \\"boys\\" too cheery, frankly, as in \\"pop-cheery,\\" for many other bands can do that.The cuts sound good, just overly familiar. I love it when they surprise me with wry lyrics, big dramatic chord changes,and a sort of Broadway-goes-disco sensibility.I don't mind political themes, long as the music moves me.This review is an initial reaction only.As many Pet Shop Boys fans may already know, their songs have a tendency to delightfully morph with repeated listenings so far all I know I may yet fall in love with a few more cuts on this album. Certainly \\"Vulnerable\\" is a candidate. These guys are always worth it;I don't think twice about buying whatever they put out, including their so called B sides, which are sometimes incredible and too numerous to mention here.
0765348780|5.0|Edit:<br />This is certainly a book that deserves a second reading, because you're just dumped into the story and have to figure out which way is up. Also, after reading more of this series, more and more is explained, and defined. After getting to this point, I look back and think NOW of how awesome this first book was. I feel that I would want to read this one over and over, though not the others.<br /><br />What I wrote before:<br /><br />This book is different. That makes it interesting, but I'm not sure if that makes it great. I still gave it a 3 star because it was \\"okay\\". There were parts of the story that were awesome, and a couple of places where I laughed out loud (which normally doesn't happen to me in print).<br /><br />I seriously think this was a good story, but the telling was lack-luster. I almost gave up on this book at the 150 page point, after which things get more interesting. Now, I love having lots of characters to deal with, and GOTH is full of them, but in the beginning, many of the characters are not very well defined, because they are doing similar things. Since the book does not linger for long on the characters before moving somewhere else, it's all but impossible to remember them. For example, all of the mages in a squad all seemed pretty much the same. Compare to Eye of the World: I know the places and people, but may not remember the names, because the book takes the time to let you get to know them. I think GOTH expects you to remember the new names that show up on nearly every page.<br /><br />Also, as the story progresses, there are many turns of events that seem more significant, yet they did not feel that way. Instead of a GRRM jaw drop, it leaves me asking \\"who did what with a what now?\\" It is interesting not to have everything explained, but it would be nice if enough was given ahead of time to give revelations their full weight.<br /><br />Having said all of that, this may be worth a second reading, since I better know all thecharacters, places, and what the heck is going on.
B0015YGA0Y|5.0|Love this DVD.  I have seen Mana perform in person and this DVD was every bit as good.  It felt like I had the band performing right in my home.  Great production.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves Mana.
B001UREJWM|2.0|Even though there is only one \\"true\\" Black Sabbath-Osbourne, Iommi, Butler, and Ward (R.I.P the original LINE UP), the inception of this version now known as Heaven and Hell, which no one calls them, just isnt cutting it anymore. The album starts out, if you can call it that, slow and drudging, no no i want Neon Knights or even Turn up the Night, with Dios vocals still strong the fans deserved this. Well all songs follow the same route, the big ole Cathedral sounding land of doom, scraping though the mud half awake syndrome. This is not Dios forte' even though he's one of the greatest vocalists in metal, even now. Its not just that he sounds out of place sometimes, its just the writing is very very lackluster and seems very boring and rushed to me. Actually forced would be a better word here. I'm not going to go on about this because its just not worth it, i'm highly disappointed is all to see the boys in a slump, but after all these years its to be expected. The pluses would be, Bible Black, and Fear but other than that umm it just feels tired. Sorry guys, even though there all 60 or over(Dio is 67!!)he feels like the only one thats into the music. Vinnie is the youngest and wow does he sound bored. Wish them luck in the future, i wish OZ would come back around, but he's to much of an A#$ these days.
B001KNUQ64|1.0|It's now very well known that the labelling on this disc is deceptive - it was NOT taken from the original analog master tape, but from a second generation copy and DAT. Sonically, it is not bad, but not anywhere close to the earlier gold CD from the now defunct DCC. Not enough of an upgrade over the last Capitol remaster to be worthwhile.
0743201140|5.0|The problem with our society and our working environment is that we focus too much on correcting our weakness instead of focusing on the strength. This is partly due to our education system and our upbringing. We have trained ourselves to get well-rounded and become mediocre.<br /><br />This book convinced us that we should focus our energy and efforts on developing our strength. However, we shouldn't ignore our weaknesses; we should work on our weaknesses so that it could not undermine our strength.<br /><br />The book explains further the different between talent, knowledge and skills. It also explores how we could identify our talent.<br />The most important reason to own this book is to use the online strength test provided in the book which could help you identify your talents.<br /><br />The last part of this book examines how we should manage our talents and develop them into strength. It also explains how organization should utilize the potential of their employees and build the company into a strength-based organization.
B001KNUQ8M|2.0|I had high hopes for this remaster from Audio Fidelity. And for sure, it is not bad, and has it's merits. However, it is doubtful that this remaster was done from the true original analog master tapes, and even the liner notes are silent as to the source used, relying only on engineer Steve Huffman's name, gained through exhausting self-promotion.     Sonically, it exhibits a smiley-face eq with prominent bass and a tipped up brightness on top, with elements of digititis on high transients betraying the likely DAT source. Or maybe Huffman just needs a better digital setup? Mobile Fidelity has their own, proprietary all analog tube mastering chain and only use true analog masters.     Audio Fidelity should maybe use the excellent engineers of MOFI for their product. This one is good, but not enough of an upgrade over the current Capitol remaster to be worthwhile. Still sounds too digital, unlike the now defunct DCC. Pass.
B001ECDVKE|4.0|I caught this on tv last night. I'm glad I did because I haven't seen this movie in years, and was a good way to refresh my memory. This is an awesome movie with great special effects and good actors such as Michael J. Fox, Jack Nicholson, Pierce Brosnan, Sarah Jessica Parker, Glenn Close, and many more! I love the way it reminded me of the classic martian films of the 50's, such as The War of the Worlds. Martians visit Earth, claiming to come in peace, but they really came to destroy us and the planet. I also love the black comedy throughout with the Martians having fun, until we take a stand and fight back! I highly recommend MARS ATTACKS!!!
B001K61O6C|5.0|Of course this is one of the very all time greats, and the Universal double CD deluxe edition of some years ago had a very good remastering job. But as usual, Mobile Fidelity has produced an amazing remaster that has a true analog sound with superb warmth and incredible detail at the same time. A rich, vivid tonality and not even a hint of digititis are the hallmarks of the MFSL sound, and of couse, they only remaster direct from the original analog master tape (unlike the dubious sources of other \\"huffy\\" celebrity wannabee engineers) - and it shows.    Worth every penny. Just get it. It can never sound better.
B0027J4SKA|5.0|Melody Gardot is an amazing artist, her voice is pure and filled with emotions.  This selection of songs reminds me of listening to great live music in a New Orleans jazz club, where the room is cool, dark and seductive.  Her back story on how she came to music is tragic, she was hit by a car while riding her bicycle.  Music therapy was recommended as a way to rebuild her cognitive and physical abilities.  Her first CD, Some Lessons - The Bedroom Sessions was a product of her therapy sessions.(By the way I also highly recommend that album which can be found at CD Baby.)    This CD is a magnificent change from overproduced vanilla pop.  The songs that she wrote for this third album have a more sophisticated feel that won't alienate the listener.  For those who said her previous album was simply one continuous song, I think you'll feel differently about My One and Only Thrill.  Simply listen to her version of Over the Rainbow, Judy Garland made it sound hopeful, Eva Cassidy's rendition was wistful and Melody gives it Brazilian soul!!  Melody's road to becoming a musician was painful and cruel but she shows how an artist can't be held back by physical or mental limitations.  I'm looking forward to hearing more from this wonderful singer/songwriter.
B001P3SA94|4.0|I'm not a huge blues fan, I bought the movie because I like Adrien Brody. But I really enjoyed the story and the music. The history lesson was great and I'll be listening to more blues.
1595141715|4.0|This is one of the best coming of age stories I have read in a long time. The stuggles that the character deals with are so real and hit teens really at home make this book a must read for all students. READ IT you wont be dissapointed.
B001TH16DS|5.0|After viewing only a few episodes I could quickly see and hear an amazing improvement in this fantastic Blu-ray edition.  First,  the picture on the Blu-ray edition is shown in it's original aspect ratio with black bars on the outer edges of the screen.  Second, the picture restoration is just tremendous, especially with the use of contrast in order to create more vivid color and clarity, although I did notice some very minor debris still left behind.  That said, the picture here is the best ever for this series. Because I consider myself a purist and a fan since the show debuted, I was more than a little skeptical about the new visual effects, but to my surprise found them strangely compelling.  The new effects in no way take you out of the experience, nor do they feel excessive.  Once I see all the new effects, I may return to the original, but don't hold me to it.  As for the new 7.1 surround sound, I still prefer the original mono mix, but as I've mentioned, I'm a bit of a purist.  The new mix does sound bright with great dynamics throughout.  This is the third time I've purchased this series.  I believe Star Trek fans have finally been offered an edition worthy of this brilliant program.  I highly recommend the Blu-ray edition of Star Trek The Original Series Season One.  It's a wonderful value for the money, and I can't wait to see the next two seasons.  A must have for every Star Trek fan.
B001IBIQU6|3.0|I like Depeche Mode, and consider myself a fan.  Can anyone honestly say this album has an Enjoy the Silence on it, or an In Your Room, or Dream On, or Personal Jesus???  Sure, give these guys their props, they are out there making art, but they simply are not as good/inspired as they were.  Is it blasphemy to say that?
B00005JMEW|2.0|Snoozy.<br /><br />Like watching Kabuki theatre, or Noh...it is that dull, and unless you have the same visual and cinematic archeology, you never \\"get\\" it. I feel like Homer Simpson watching Twin Peaks. Not only do \\"[y]ou never forget that Kill Bill is an exercise in genre-sampling,\\" you get beaten over the head with and told you are a dummy because you don't know what the film is referring to.<br /><br />The story follows a woman who goes on a rampage of revenge. Smarfart cineophiles get their eyeballs stroked like tools with nearly every shot.<br /><br />The mundane and exotic are contrasted so starkly you begin to think the film is actually being shot in black and white and you are simply graphemic.
0743219619|2.0|This Dalgliesh novel is a bit of a curiosity from Ms. James, because it's neither very interesting as a mystery nor does it contain particularly compelling characters.   Compared to her work in general, I found it unusually uninvolving and I almost didn't finish the book, so little did I care about the plot or the people in it.    One suspects that part of P.D. James' goal was to write somewhat of a meditation on Dalgliesh in a muted mode after an illness, but while this is referred to early on, it ceases being a very useful facet of the book by the time he arrives at the Toynton Grange location where most of the story takes place.   Perhaps Ms. James was influenced by Josephine Tey's THE SINGING SANDS (wherein a convalescing detective has a fairly poetic and metaphysical experience near the sea), but THE BLACK TOWER captures none of the tone or sense of \\"suspended reality\\" of Ms. Tey's far superior book.    It's hard to recommend this even to P.D. James fans.   She's always a little understated, and the characters are usually a bit on the bleak side.  But usually they are at least interesting.  Not a single character in this book rings very true or seems very \\"alive\\" to the reader.   I don't know what H.R.F. Keating could have been thinking when he called this one of the 100 greatest mysteries.  It's a bigger mystery why he would have valued this slight and wholly forgettable book so highly.

0064410935|5.0|A farm girl named Fern adopts Wilbur the pig and nurses him, but her father doesn't want to keep a runt, so he farms the pig out to his brother-in-law. Nonetheless Fern goes every day to visit Wilbur, where she sits on a stool and listens in on all the barnyard conversations. Charlotte, the wisest of the barnyard animals, tells Wilbur that his days are numbered, causing him no small distress. The spider finds a way to save him from turning into bacon by spinning words into her web. Wilbur's fame spreads until the day of the county fair, where he wins a prize. By that time Fern, however, would rather be off riding the Ferris wheel with Henry Fussy. In the end, well, as we all know, pigs live longer than spiders, but Charlotte has left her mark not only on Wilbur but on all who read this touching little story.       This is one of the strangest stories I have ever read. It's a bit like Puff the Magic Dragon, when little Jackie Paper comes around no more, but Wilbur was never attached to Fern in the first place. His one true friend was Charlotte. Of course the entire cast of barnyard characters, the rat, the geese, the sheep, the hired hand, all add to the color of the story, but it is the wisdom of the spider that spins the plot of this 1950s classic. E.B. White's style is simple and direct. The illustrations by Garth Williams bring out the earthiness of the story. I'll give it five stars for style.
B0017V7GTY|5.0|I would like to echo other reviewers here and say that this is the BEST CD I have heard in a long, long time.  The Gaslight Anthem are super catchy and they have stories to tell.  It's a healthy mix of Bruce Springsteen, The Cure, The Killers, Counting Crows, and even a little splash of Rancid, all in an Americana Punk sort of way.  Very different but highly enjoyable.  The first four songs (Great Expectations, The '59 Sound, Old White Lincoln, & High Lonesome) are near perfection and when I have a 15-20 minute drive, these songs get me through the drive along with \\"Meet Me By The River's Edge.\\"  Superb songwriting and I can't wait for their next album in 2010!
B0006IUDXA|5.0|MacGyver is one of the most well known 80s shows even today. Anyone who loved him then, will continue to with this box set.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|I was intrigued the first time I heard this album but then for the next month I hated it and was so disappointed. Then a strange thing happened I fell madly in love with the album and Depeche Mode all over again. The songs had slowly grown on me and got under my skin. There is advanced simplicity in this album and it contains some of their best songs. Martin is on top form and I love the increasing spiritual subject matter in many of the songs. Dave's songwriting team have come up with a belter also in 'Come Back'. A band that has thankfully matured with age and to use the cliche like a fine wine gets better with age.
B000T9QF8S|5.0|This is the latest incarnation of Solti's first Beethoven symphony cycle with the Chicago Symphony, recorded in the early 1970s.  Despite Decca's claim, I can hear no obvious remastering, but remastering wasn't required, as this is a well-recorded and beautifully performed cycle.  In this edition, the symphonies are not split between discs and there is an extra CD interviewing Solti about his approach to Beethoven, which is rather purist.  He doesn't reorchestrate anything, takes every repeat, and religiously follows all dynamics and other markings.  This alone makes the cycle worthwhile, since you don't feel like you're experiencing Beethoven through someone else's thick lense.  On top of that, we have the Chicago Symphony at its height and with something to prove, and Solti's trademark sense of structure and timing.  All things considered, this cycle wears extremely well over time and, along with Blomstedt's cycle with Dresden, remains one of my favorite sets of Beethoven symphonies.
B001RTP48G|5.0|Van het nieuwe album Yes van het poppy synthpopduo Pet Shop Boys heb ik de luxe versie met de bonus disc Etc. gekocht. In 2003 had ik de Pop-Art-Mix 3CD set gekocht als een compilatie van hits en voorbije jaren, niet met de verwachting, dat Neil Tennant en Chris Lowe anno 2009 zouden terugkeren met een kanjer van een popalbum. Herkenbare tunes, zoals in de opener en eerste single Love Etc., het dansbare All Over The World, dat speelt met de Notenkraker van Tchaikovsky. Love Etc gaat over de leegte van een materieel ingesteld leven zonder liefde. Genoeg herkenning voor de 80's minded, zoals in de discotrack Did You See Me Coming?, Beautiful People en Vulnerable. Hoewel Brian Higgins / Xenomania (Sugababes, Girls Aloud) voor de samenwerking was gezocht en drie songs samen werden geschreven, klinken Pet Shop Boys en niet als onnodig modern opgepoetst. More Than A Dream start wat meer electro, maar kickt door in een lekkere dans/klap ritme, dat overigens wel uitnodigt om te mixen al dan niet in een hoger tempo. Na het vette Building a Wall is het mid-tempo King of Rome absoluut indrukwekkend. Het als eerste song voor dit album geschreven Pandemonium is weer up-tempo, terwijl The Way It Used To Be een perfecte synthpop song is met vocale inbreng van Carla Marie Williams. Met Legacy (aan alles komt een eind, je moet ermee leren leven) sluit deze krachtige come-back af. Op de bonus disc staat &eacute;&eacute;n nieuwe song, het electronica getinte This used to be the future, waarop Philip Oakey (The Human League) meezingt. Met de dubmixen van de hand van Xenomenia en Pet Shop Boys van nummers van Yes vormt dit een aantrekkelijk aanbod om de 'gewone' albumversie te laten liggen: een funky versie van More Than a Dream, electronica varianten van Pandemonium en be the future en The way it used to be. De Notenkraker komt uitgebreid aan bod in de This is a dub versie van All Over The World. Ook de Public Eye dub van Vulnerable en de Beautiful Dub van Love etc. mogen er zijn. \\"A group of quite poppy songs\\", zoals de heren zelf in de online bonus area vertellen.e poppy songs\\", zoals de heren zelf in de online bonus area vertellen.

B001TOD92C|5.0|After \\"Requiem for a Dream\\", I figured that Aranovsky had found all forms of despair that were to be discovered. He one-upped himself with \\"The Wrestler\\", a thoughtful foray into the life of \\"Randy the Ram\\". This is Mickey Rourke's big comeback, and Aranovsky pays tribute to Hiller's \\"Mommie Dearest\\", by not showing his face til the last sensible moment. Mickey Rourke is, indeed, remarkable; tough and sweet and sensitive at all the required moments. He was deserving of the many awards bestowed upon him. Marisa Tomei is also fine, in a complicated role that she handles brilliantly.Her innate sweetness is prevalent throughout, regardless of the moment. There's a few short moments involving Evan Rachel Wood, as Randy's daughter, that created the most angst, and brought out Randy's sweetness and sensitivity. Those were special moments, though brief. Mr. Aranofsky took a gamble casting Mickey, and it was a good call. He also took a gamble in \\"Requiem\\" making Jared Leto look ugly. I look forward to seeing Mickey Rourke bounce back, and I thank Mr. Aranovsky for giving him this opportunity. Mr. Aranovsky's next film about depravity may include Faye Dunaway (Mickey's co-star in \\"Barfly\\")...she needs a comeback. I love her. She's a maverick!
031606792X|5.0|I was somewhat disappointed at how Breaking Dawn begun, but then I couldn't see Stephenie Meyer starting the story any other way. I fell in love with Renesmee and was surprised at how nice Rose was to Bella. With Jacob I thought that he could have also ended up with Leah but was happy with his decision. over all I am satisfied with Stephenie's latest book even thought it meant the end of the series.
1582701709|1.0|It did not deliver what I thought it would.  It didn't even make for interesting reading.  Having said that, while every book seems to have something that everyone can take away from it, I can truly  say with sincerity I drew a blank with \\"Secret\\". No \\"Secret\\" in this book.  Simply a lot of babble.
0307474275|5.0|Dan Brown's Da Vinci Code features Robert Langdon, last seen destroying the Vatican Library in Brown's [[ASIN:B000FBJFSM Angels & Demons]], reading the earlier title isn't a prerequisite to enjoying this one; Da Vinci Code stands alone. Like all Dan Brown books, this one is a page-turner that is hard to put down. Full of twists and turns at a breakneck pace as the search for the Grail becomes a simultaneous flight from attack. It is also a title that can be re-read, packed with interesting trivia that bears re-examination; while it is a fun read, full of fast-paced action, there are elements of the novel that themselves might serve as the subject of scholarly analysis; this title defines intellectual thriller.
B000002AS3|5.0|When Oasis first came to America I remember everyone saying that Oasis was the second coming of the Beatles.  If this CD doesn't explain why then you've never listened to the Beatles.  If you like the Beatles, and I love the Beatles, you'll fall in love with this CD.  It has all the sound of a great Beatles record.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|Excellent soundtrack!  I loved it in the movie.  Even better on the CD.
0142406112|4.0|This series is another great set of adventures penned by Anthony Horowitz, his ability to contain suspense, mystery and danger will have your eyes glued to the pages.  Although I must say that it isn't nearly as good as the gatekeeps series of which I am eager to finish.  This is for sure worth picking up and getting into, you won't be diapointed.
0316036692|5.0|Gladwell takes your thinking abilities \\"outside the box\\".Yet while doing so he is not  intrusive.The book seems to lead you on a journey as if you were reading fiction;while being mindful that the writer is dead serious.Very informative while maintaining an easyness to follow along.
B001U0HBPQ|3.0|This movie had an interesting story and concept behind it. The backstory is great.  The execution and story telling made this movie a long and slow moving story.  I felt like I was a 16 year old listening to my grandfather telling me the story of his life on the farm.  There was little of interest in the story from start to finish and it was painfully too long for the story involved.    Additionally, the movie showcases weak morals and no real positive elements.
B00024I2Z4|5.0|Though we have not watched it yet, the product was in the plastic wrapping as described.
B001N26GFM|5.0|This movie is not a \\"feel-good\\" movie that you walk away happy.  It is a movie that you see real evolution of characters.  The movie takes place in very dark times of world history, being World War II; and is tied to the catastrophic events of the extermination of the Jews by the Nazis.    The story follows a family that covers the innocence of children, the misguided ideology of Nazi leadership, and the changing view of the civilian population.  The ending is dark and depressing.    Overall this is an excellent film creating awareness of a historical event that everyone needs to learn about and understand.  We can't deny such events and this is a great movie that also brings awareness of the history.      Aside from the historical aspect of this film, the writers and directors did a great job in telling a story.  Character development is strong and thorough, the story is well developed, and overall it is a high quality story.  The development of the story and characters for this movie is the best I have seen for many years.  Since it is not a heavy special effects and action movie, it was able to have a quality story.    I would place this on my \\"Must See\\" lists along with Schindler's List.

0393327655|3.0|Sam is kind of losing his touch here.  He previous books have been much more succinct than this one. The topic, lets start questioning the beliefs of religious people, is very good but Sam took too much of an academic approach and thus will not reach the general masses needed to make any real change in the world.      I really wish he could have shown a real justification for an emotional argument; for instance why blind faith is unhealthy for us all.    Sam could have taken on the \\"liberal establishment\\" more for their cowardly and uncaring assent to people's religiosity.   That religion can be abusive to the person who subscribes to it is undeniable but `liberals' seem to not care about religious people for fear that those same people will confront them and their unhealthy beliefs and ways.   A truly liberal person is liberal with their love and thus would care about all people enough to confront their unhealthy practices and would appreciate that same kind of caring back.
B00028HBKC|1.0|A brutal portrayal of the death of Jesus. Very violent and graphic. There was not much to this except someone getting beaten, and beaten, and whipped, and whipped with razor-tipped whips, then beaten and whipped again. Then he musters up the energy to carry a cross and then gets nailed to it.<br /><br />The guy who played Jesus did a fantastic character portrayal. He was in another movie I watched and of course I did not recognize him as the same actor in Passion.<br /><br />My major complaint lies in the fact that most of this movie is based on beatings and torture. Hostel is kindergarten compared to this! Maybe show a bit of what else Jesus did in his life.
0743270754|5.0|What can I say that has not already been said?  This book is a tour de force deserving of all the accolades it has and will receive!  Goodwin took arguably the most written about man in history and created a very unique and enthralling insight into his character, his interpersonal dynamics, and the extraordinarily difficult times in which he labored.  It is evident the detailed and exhaustive research she put into this work.  Her writing is breathless - superb!  This is a cherished addition to my library (one that I hope to get signed by the author some day)!
B000MR9D5E|5.0|The view of the wonders of nature are taken in a most organized way leaving no stone unturned. I simply love the series and highly recommend it to all.
B001UREJWM|5.0|After only a few listens to this CD, track #1, \\"Atom and Evil\\" is stuck in my head - always a good sign.  I recently heard a guitarist say \\"All the best riffs have already been written\\" but Iommi proves that he still has plenty in the well.<br /><br />Anyone who enjoyed the newly recorded bonus tracks on the \\"Dio Years\\" will like the material on this album.  I've read some comparisons to \\"Dehumanizer\\" but I find the song pacing and song themes more akin to \\"Mob Rules,\\" \\"Heaven and Hell,\\" and even a little \\"Holy Diver.\\"  There is even one chord pattern that reminds me of \\"Born Again.\\"<br /><br />The recording on this album is top notch.  The album is produced \\"loud\\", but does not suffer from brick wall limiting like we have heard on other recent releases.  The performances on this album are pretty tight - perhaps a result of the active touring schedule.<br /><br />I saw one Dio show and two Heaven and Hell shows over the past few years.  It is obvious that Ronnie James Dio's voice is still in top form - the tracks on this CD is no exception.  Tony Iommi certainly has his chops.  In fact he sounds better than ever.  Geezer Butler remains one of my favorite bassists.  And Vinny Appice is rock solid.  It bugs me that a few reviewers have dogged on Appice.  The style of his drumming is 100% appropriate for this material.  I'm glad that the band chose Appice for drums instead of trying to bring in Bill Ward or Simon Wright.<br /><br />It seems that many rock and metal acts have been perfectly happy repackaging their back catalog, rather than coming out with new music. It is good to hear new stuff from this classic lineup.  I can't wait to see them support this material live!
0596009208|2.0|I found this book to be lacking in examples to the point of being nearly useless as a reference item due to all the \\"fun\\" inserted ad nauseum. It seemed like this book was written for people over 50 who know next to nothing about computers or programming. This book is well written overall but the target audience is clearly not the serious student. Get this book to learn Java basics casually but if you are in a college class this is not your book.
B000SJJCX4|5.0|I bought this product for my 36 yr old husband and he loves it. He's in a band and it is small, convienant, and he says it works great!
B000FC1AGG|5.0|This was my first Sophie Kinsella book and I was not disappointed. It's so funny my tummy hurt from laughing. The characters were likable enough. Just a thoroughly entertaining read.
B001P9KR8U|3.0|Add up: hype,awards,inspirational story and a brilliant director. The sum of this movie is less than its shiny parts. First things first: Danny Boyle knows how to put a story on the big screen (the druggish underworld of Trainspotting and the spaced out sci/fi/psych thriller Sunshine are proof of this). S.M. is shot artfully and acted out reasonably well. Somehow, Slumdog misses the mark. It tries to tug at your heart but pushes you away instead. (SPOILER ALERT!) A boy covered in feces is gross; an orphan being maimed is sadistic and telling the poor that your only shot at success is by winning a game show (magically predestined) is insulting.<br />I could forgive these mis-steps if the emotions conveyed actually affected me. The stunningly beautiful Freida Pinto and D. Patel should have delivered fireworks. Instead, we get sappy sereotypical moments that fizzle. To its credit, this film aims high. And while others (critics, the academy etc.) believe it hits the mark, the story leaves me mostly untouched and unmoved.
B001UREJWM|5.0|They can call it Black Sabbath, Heaven and Hell, or whatever they want as far as I'm concerned.  What matters is the music and what you get here is an amazing slab of Sabbath/Dio style metal.  There really isn't a bad track here.  If you buy one record this year let this be it.  Please don't miss out.
0061537934|5.0|I loved this book so much, I couldn't even stand not to share it. Normally, I don't share books I like because I hate the idea of not getting it back, but I lent this out immediately. Everyone should read this book, and I don't care if I never get it back, because I won't resent buying a new copy.
0783240287|5.0|[[ASIN:0783240287 Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat]]  I found this DVD by chance in a local store, and since I am a big fan of musicals, decided to buy it.  My children age 7 and nearly 2, where amazed by the colors of the production, story and music, and they sit down and pay attention from beginning to end. I loved Donny Osmond's performance and the voice of the narrator, Maria Friedman.   We have watched this DVD every day for the last two weeks, and it is already my children's favourite one, above children's movies and all.  If you have small children, this could be an amazing present for them, they will enjoy it a lot. I'm already recommending it to all my friends with little ones.
6304698658|5.0|This is a must have movie. Very funny. I orderded 2.One for myself and one for a friend.
B001T30232|5.0|As a racing fan and a dog owner/lover I found this novel, written through Enzo the dog's perspective, brilliant. A great story line filled with fun, humor, tragedy, drama and fighting character prevailing against injustice. The ending was perfect and I put the book down really touched. You don't have to be a racing fan or dog lover to like this book. It's full of life's lessons and you will love it.
0525421033|4.0|Hmm... what can I say about If I Stay?    The Good: Wow. If I Stay is memorable, it has unique characters that I'm sure, years from now I'll remember. I know I always start of critiquing the characters but, what can I stay? I need well-developed characters!    Adam! Unlike the playboy rockstar boyfriends that leave you broken-hearted, crying, or pregnant (or all of the above), Adam is an awesome guy. Awesome Adam, there ya go! There's a part in the book (that I don't want to spoil for you guys) that just really made my heart melt.    Mia's parents are so quirky and unique that I was kinda of jealous of Mia (even though I do love my Mom). I just wanted to hug each character in this book.    And the scene with Mia's grandpa... it made me really miss my Grandpa and wish that he was still alive, even if I didn't know him.    Another thing I loved was how music played such a huge part in If I Stay. Music is love in search of word, that's my little bumper sticker wisdom tidbit of the day for y'all. If I Stay was a lot funnier than I thought it would be. I mean, who thinks a book about death is funny? ...actually, I can think of a few (don't ask, it's a long story).     This book made me think. If I had the choice, would I stay or would I leave? Mia has grown and at the end, I couldn't help but feel proud of her because I was just so freaking happy.    The Bad: I was a little dissapointed with this novel. It's a very good novel, but I was expecting great! Maybe my expectations were too high but, with all the great reviews it was getting... but I guess it just didn't click for me.    One of the problems I had with it was writing. I know I'm probably going to die for this, but OH em gee... it reminded me of Twilight for Edward's sake! How can this be?! Come on, did anyone of you HONESTLY think that Mia sounds like a 17 year old?    The writing... it does NOT sound like a teenager's voice. It sounds like a freaking middle age woman's (no offese to the writer, in ANY way) voice!! I mean, you CAN use abbreviations! That just annoyed me to no end. It won't (<---) kill you to use the damn abbrieviations! And don't even say that Mia was just mature. N-O. There's a line between maturity and just unnaturally old, and Mia fell into the second most of the time.   Another thing, everyone is telling how much they sobbed during it... don't see it. I just didn't cry or even get teary-eyed!! Gosh, I must be stone-hearted or something, but I just don't see the heart wrentching, tear-inducing thing that everyone else does. Yes, it was very emotional during some parts and the ending gave me goosebumps, but the writing fell flat to me... just a tiny bit. Another thing, the material used on the cover... it sucks. Sorry, I just had to get it out.   Overall: This is a story that I'll remember for a very, very long time. If I Stay is a book that will keep you reading until the last page.    Grade: B+ when I first read it, A- when I processed my thoughts about it.
B0001HAISQ|5.0|If you want to get away from the mundane existence of everyday life and go on a great adventure, I would suggest getting this movie.  It takes the J.M. Barrie tale to wonderful new heights with stunning visuals and gorgeous landscapes.  And the children chosen to act were superb.  Jeremy Sumpter is the perfect Pan, with a mischievous grin and a wonderful sparkle in his beautiful green eyes.  And Rachel Hurd-Wood makes an amazing debut as Wendy.  She is perfect for the part, playing the role as I had always envisioned it being played in my head.  The wonderful undercurrent of a young crush between Peter and Wendy is both sweet and heart-breaking, as this can never be, because Peter will never grow up.  Also, added to this already wonderful film is the extra of the alternate ending.  I won't ruin it for those who haven't seen it, except to say that it's clear they weren't planning to use it in the film as you can see the special effects props quite clearly.  And also to say that the alternate ending allows for a wonderful transition into the movie \\"Hook\\" which once I finish watching, I will review.    Two Thumbs as high up as I can go!!!!
B001QOOCTE|5.0|The 1st time I knew of Playing for Change was from an interview with Mark Johnson on PBS's Bill Moyers. It was so heartwrenching because of the thought behind it that it made me cry. After seeing the videos on the newly released DVD (and CD combo) it was no less inspiring. This is one of the most unique and thoughtful piece(s) of art in music form I think I have ever experienced. Thank you Mark Johnson for bringing this to all of us. Such phenomenal talent from all over the world brought together this way is remarkable!
B000GPIPSS|1.0|Okay, first off, my TV must have broke, because this movie has no color in it! That's inexcusable, as they had color back then. Not only that, but the special effects are like a high school play's, and not even CGI. Plus this movie is all wrong with the assumptions about vampires. They don't die when exposed to sunlight. They just sparkle.<br /><br />For a woman who knows about vampires, check out Stephenie Meyer.
B001TIQT98|4.0|Leonard Bernstein was my hero in those days.  He was young, good looking, much like the folks in the White House.  I loved his music, and I thought he could no no wrong.  In the years that have passed, I've grown to enjoy his compositions more than his conducting, which is often uh.... unusual.  Some of these recordings are considered the best available, and I will state without reservation that they've never sounded better than they do in this set.  But for me, none would be a first choice.  If you love these performances, you will absolutely love the way they sound in this latest remastering.  I will enjoy coming to them occasionally.  It's for sure that NO ONE else does Mahler quite like Lenny.
B000ETDW16|5.0|It's really sad to see so many brainiacs trying to decipher the movie.   No wonder they can't enjoy the movie.  They are too busy trying to find every single scientific mistake, instead of relaxing and enjoying the movie.  It's a sci-fi Hollywood picture and not a physics test.  Most Americans don't care if the gravity was accurate or not.  They made us believe the rotation of the asteroid gave a certain amount of gravity.  It's a movie and not a documentary.  If I wanted to be bored about scientific facts, I would tune into the PBS channel.  The people who gave bad reviews are the same people, like my wife, try to figure out the ending and looking for every flaw.  Just relax and watch the movie.  Stop being such a nerd!  Stop comparing a movie to the book version.  Stop writing reviews because you have nothing better to do with your time.  I assume you are those boring people on dates or an unpleasant spouse.  You might enjoy the twists at the end like 6th Sense and The Village if you weren't trying so hard to examine the movie.      Sit back, relax and enjoy the ride.  This was a very fun and entertaining movie.   The cast did a great job!   It was action packed and suspenseful.  Special effects and sound effects were out of this world.  I can't wait to get this in blu-ray.        Note:  For all those smart as# reviewers out there.  Please look up the definition of science fiction.  There is no need to bash one of my favorite movies.  Drink a beer and try watching the movie again.  You will feel like 90% of the other American's out there that enjoyed the movie. :)
B00001ODGR|4.0|Ah, classic Styx doing their greatest hits in concert.  That brings back great memories.  This is a very good dvd and worth owning.  It does make me miss Dennis, though.  I'm sorry, but his ego and cheesyness were actually what defined Styx.  I like his theatrics.  And he was the driving force in the early days (when the only hit they had was Lady).  If it wasn't for Dennis, I suspect Tommy wouldn't even be in the band!  And JY just might be \\"flipping burgers\\" to borrow an expression from another review.  They kicked him out of the band, so I'd say they're the one's with the egos, and now they play bars and fairs.  This is a reminder of what Styx WAS, and I think they made a huge mistake kicking him out: for better or for worse, cheesy factors and all- he was the leader and defining character of the band- and this shows it.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|Sure another email with a link, this is how I found this. Do yourself and your friends a favor, get this and play it once for a friend and you will get an immediate \\"Where did you get this...Must Have!\\"

B001UREJWM|5.0|After hearing only a few sound bites of this one, it was perfectly clear that true Sab. Mk. II fans can raise their devil horns even higher than ever before! At last, Tony, Geezer, Ronnie, and Vinny A. have once again delivered a superb all around recipe of Sabbath that only this foursome can conjure up! This album has several tracks that grab you immeditately and a few that need a few listens especially the slower doomy rockers! Let's face it, brand new material from veteran rock acts always seems to get a 50/50 chance because their pasts have always dictated their legacies! However, in order to give true value to new albums like this one, fans like us need to listen completely, absorb whats been offered, then judgement day can hopefully be rendered in a fair and sensible way!    The Devil You know brings to you the following:    Atom And Evil - Very sequel like to Shadow Of The Wind  Excellent midtempo rocker with equal size and strength.   Nice opener for the album/loud/powerful/doom and gloom!     Fear - INMOP, one of the best mid/upbeat rockers on the album.   All new, on it's own, and fearless!    Bible Black - Intro. reminds us of the Sign of Crosses past and   then drops you into the depths of Hell with a Vengeance! Great   track all the way!                  Double The Pain - Fantastic intro. from Geezer Butler, a fresh   page that rivals Masters Of Insanity and then kicks the Lucifer   right in the proverbial Hades/Ouch!!!!!!    Rock And Roll Angel - Someone already dissed this one? Hey   can't please us all! I agree very Dio like and needs a few   listens, but I never thought are you kidding! Instead followed   the sound which professes dark angelic overtones mixed with   some dramatic rift changeups/very interesting/nicely done track!                            The Turn Of The Screw - A descent nuts & bolts rocker/enjoyed it!    Eating The Cannibals - Another excellent track/more fast   paced/kind of Ear In The Wall like/all around awesome!    Follow TheTears - Errie soundscape intro./keys/choirish mourns/  building riffs of fire! Then deep & dark, doom laden Sabbath   drags you through Hell on this ride! Best slow paced rocker   on the album!    Neverwhere - Another uptempo rocker/definitely delivers us with Evil!    Breaking Into Heaven - Like the opener/midtempo/loud/great track!    Overall, Heaven And Hell/(Black Sabbath Mk. 2) and The Devil   You Know are very much alive and well in 2009! Mr. Butler and   the 3 Italians can still master the Metal! Thank you Tony,   Geezer, Ronnie, and Vinny for this fabulous album! Go pick   this one up ASAP!
B00005221M|3.0|Sorry this isn't a review of this actual DVD, because I've seen only the version of the film shown recently a fair amount on Fox Movie Channel and HD Net (the same version on both).  If you're familiar with that, I'd appreciate you're noting in the comments for this review whether the aired version is the original or this director's cut. Thanks -- it'll make the buying decision easier.

B0000048CX|5.0|I did a doubletake when I clicked on this page to write a review of Fakebook and saw that its original release date was 1990.  I had forgotten that almost 20 years have passed since this disc was released.  That makes the contents all that more remarkable.  The music contained herein is timeless, gently-played and almost ethereal takes on pop tunes created by artists often even more obscure than Yo La Tengo.  After several albums of Sonic Youth-inspired (and sometimes excessive) noise-pop, Yo La Tengo did a very Velvet Undergroundy about-face (ie, from [[ASIN:B000002G7E White Light/White Heat]] to [[ASIN:B000002G7G The Velvet Underground]]) and released this quiet gem.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, it's great music for summertime.  I discovered it during a foggy Berkeley (CA) Springtime so for me it conjures up memories of gray Northrn California days (that for me is a good thing).  It's moody and atmospheric without trying to be, and very, very heartfelt.<br /><br />I think this disc achieves what a lot of modern indie rockers are going for - hushed yet quirky folk-pop.  It's too bad that this one is kind of a lost classic, but then I guess that makes it all the more special for those of us who treasure it.  A true gem from the early years of alt-rock/indie music.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|Definitely don't want to miss out on these tunes!  Miss Lzzy has vocals like no one else and definitely doesn't hesitate to show them off throughout the album.  The entire album is full-blown hard rock and not one track disappoints.  Song after song, your face will surely be rocked off.
0385341067|5.0|Excellent, memorable book. Especially enjoyable for Dickens fans who have travelled in the Pacific Islands and New Zealand
044024367X|5.0|Yet again Lee Child does not fail to write a brilliant Jack Reacher Story. Jack is back as the lone righter of wrongs as he uncovers dodgy goings on in the town of Despair. Jack is cross between the Lone Ranger, Simon Templar and James Bond - with a dash of Batman thrown in for good measure. The bad guys never win with Jack Reacher around.    Lee Child sets himself apart from ordinary authors by his research and his ability to reason and explain why everything happens during the story. The only thing wrong with this book is that it ends.

B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I have been a fan for more years than I wish to count.  The Live is London album brings the listener not only to the Cohen they enjoyed for years but for the new listener there is something grand that happens. I was very surprise that a young relative (21) after asking who that was, sat and listened.  Than played the two albums all over again.  The mature delivery from the entire group is spectacular.  The poetry of the lyrics continues to transport to another bank.  Eveline Horelle Dailey
0316017922|5.0|Malcolm Gladwell does an incredible job with this   very important work on the qualities of fate!    He neithers blames nor suggests that life: is   nothing more than what happens between well   thought out plans.  What he does however, is   suggest that nothing happens without a purpose  ...and some take advantage of those opportunities  and others with similar skills either can't or   don't.    This is a must read.  It is one of those books  in life that makes you think about the processes  that we go through.  It also inspires to his   point - that \\"fate\\" can be aided with enough   effort and by the application of intelligent   inspiration.
B001VB8UAE|5.0|There's some new stuff to add to your Barbra collection with the BARBRA STREISAND: THE CONCERT DVD set.<br /><br />First off, the concert from 2006 features songs that have been beloved by Barbra fans for many years but we've never had the treat of seeing them performed live. Some songs have been performed on live albums like \\"Starting Here, Starting Now\\" (from [[ASIN:B0000024ZL Live Concert at the Forum]]) and  \\"Come Rain Or Come Shine\\" (from [[ASIN:B000JBXXXG Streisand: Live In Concert (2 CD's)]] or if you were lucky enough to get the bonus CD from the \\"Timeless\\" Concert). Other songs like \\"(Have I Stayed) Too Long At The Fair?\\" and \\"Funny Girl\\" have never been performed live (at least not to my knowledge) so you get some new stuff to see.<br /><br />The musical intro and outro is from the [[ASIN:B000002SNJ Funny Girl (1964 Original Broadway Cast)]] overture and Barbra performs \\"The Music That Makes Me Dance,\\" which was replaced with \\"My Man\\" in the movie version of Funny Girl.<br /><br />Another highlight from the 2006 concert DVD is a Q&A with the audience where they get to participate in a short sing-a-long to the song \\"Stoney End\\" ([[ASIN:B0012GN3GY Stoney End]]). I wish this was longer!<br /><br />---BONUS MATERIAL ON DVD #1---<br />(performances unless noted/play-all feature/selection)<br /><br />***Nobody's Heart (Belongs To Me)/When The Sun Comes Out***<br />I love the song WTSCO from [[ASIN:B0012GN3PU The Second Barbra Streisand Album]] and Barbra can still work this song. Oh I wish she would do an album of these types of torch-songs!<br /><br />***The Woman In The Moon***<br />Truncated version of the song from the end of the tour in Los Angeles, CA. Another song heard live on [[ASIN:B0000029BG A Star Is Born (1976 Film)]] soundtrack and movie, but never performed since.<br /><br />***Senza Catene/Regressa A Mi***<br />These are performances by the group Il Divo.

Of course Barbra's voice has changed over the years, as she might not have the range she used to, but she still has that vocal power and unmistakable sound that is pure Streisand.
B001IBIQU6|4.0|I was extremely excited for DM's new CD, Sounds of the Universe. Of course, I LOVE Wrong, which is classic Depeche Mode, so I was eagerly anticipating listening to the whole CD. I admit, I had to listen to it twice..........but I love it! All of the songs are passionate and very emotional- the one song I really connected with emotionally was Peace. I absolutely love that song. And, of course, Dave's voice is phenomenal as always. I am very pleased with this new CD and cannot wait to see them in concert again!

1439138311|4.0|***SPOILERS***<br /><br />It struck me as strange that Mr. Toibin entitled this book &#34;Brooklyn&#34; and not &#34;Eilis&#34;. For the book seemed to be just as much about life in Ireland in the 1950's as life in Brooklyn. I also expected it to be much harsher than it was, and was so happy to see it was not so. It is rather old-fashioned in some ways, and I don't mean that in a negative way.<br /><br />The book is about a young Irish woman named Eilis. She is a woman who is ultimately very honest about her feelings about life and people. The author does a most convincing job of describing what it felt like to move far away to another country, with no relatives or friends along for the journey. At times I ached so much for her. I kept thinking: &#34;Go home!&#34; But she sticks it out, and her new world slowly becomes a very interesting one of sights, sounds, seasons and people--co-workers, a landlady, a priest, housemates, fellow students, friends and customers. The store she works in is trying to attract black customers for the first time. The Jewish professor teaching her business law class had his entire family wiped out by the Nazis. Those little stories made the book intriguing to me. Then, romance started taking over the story . . . .<br /><br />Yes, romance takes over, and things start going downhill, in my opinion. Here you have a very intelligent working woman, trying to make a future for herself, and it all starts turning into a story about her relationship with an Italian plumber, and his world, and his family. Not that there was anything wrong with Tony, his occupation, or his family, but Eilis failed to realize something very important; probably due to the time period in which she lived; namely, it was important to find someone at least equal to her own intelligence level. When Eilis returns to visit Ireland, the reality of this sets in, and yet she then finds someone else who is in some ways just an Irish version of Tony. And Mr. Toibin's description of how one feels when returning to one's own country, of how the life in the new country begins to seem like nothing but a dream, was superb. But it all ends up being a &#34;no-win&#34; situation for Eilis.<br /><br />Personally, if she had to marry anyone at that time in her life, I think she should have found herself a kind, intelligent Jewish guy at college. They could have started their own bookkeeping/accounting firm. And their more equal intelligence levels, as well as the differences in their backgrounds, could have made their marriage very interesting. Because Eilis definitely seemed like the type of woman who would eventually get very bored with the role of housewife and mother, especially if married to a man of medium intelligence and interests. I don't think she realized that about herself, but definitely would one day, especially when the times started changing in the 1960's.of how one feels when returning to one's own country, of how the life in the new country begins to seem like nothing but a dream, was superb.

006135323X|4.0|Predictably Irrational is a fun and enjoyable read. It is an interesting collection of ideas on behavioral economics with entertaining descriptions of experiments. The arguments are not particularly compelling, but that is not the intention of the book. It is not intended to bore the masses with robustness checks and vigorous scientific thinking. Instead, it presents the core concept of behavioral economics in an accessible and easy to read fashion. The author offers examples, anecdotes, and experiments to illustrate how humans behave in seemingly irrational ways; ways that are not captured by traditional economic theories. If you are already well-versed in behavioral economics, then this book may not offer anything new or insightful.<br /><br />The book may be a bit light on critical thinking, but it is heavy on inspiration. It covers a wide range of topics and experiments; any one of them can spark curiosity and provoke deeper thought. It offers nice fodder for interesting conversations.<br /><br />The real beauty of this book is the author. The author's personality shines through his words and warms your soul. He is unafraid to express himself, share his sense of humor, and reveal his vulnerabilities. He is clearly passionate about his work, and you cannot help but be drawn into the book by his enthusiasm. The writing is fun, clear, and fit for a mass audience. It is an easy read and not too mentally taxing.<br /><br />I particularly liked the end of the book, where the author expresses his gratitude. Not only does he acknowledge the typical group of people, but he also thanks his reader. I found this to be a unique and sincere gesture. On top of that, he also offers short biographies of his collaborators. I have never seen anything like it in a book. It reveals his humility, for it shows his generous acknowledgement that great work cannot be accomplished alone.<br /><br />I recommend this book those who are intellectually curious, but want to read something light. If you are looking for something to revolutionize the way you think about human behavior, then this book might not be for you.ing to revolutionize the way you think about human behavior, then this book might not be for you.
B0012K1ILW|4.0|Looking at the earlier reviews, I can see why some would not give it as high a ranking. It definitely catches you off-gaurd. The album has a militant stance with \\"hidden\\" references to NOI and other principles (i.e. in Amerykan promise \\"Has any one seen my 42 laws...?\\") But, I was not discouraged and dug deeper. I saw here in concert last May in NYC and the album and the concept behind it became much clearer. 4th World War is an independent documentary that inspired the album, and it depicts everyday people taking an active stance against oppression...and succeed. Not suprisingly, the majority of us never hear of these events and the U.S. populace in general is unbelievingly naive and unaware of uprisings so close to our own backyards...but I digress :) In short, the album seeks to inspire as the film does, that we CAN make a difference. It's all too easy to become apathetic, this album is like Lawrence Fishbourne in School Daze ringing the bell alerting everyone to WAKE UP. Dig a little deeper, and think about the album with this concept in mind. Yes, it may seem like a lot of work, but she is an artist, and arent't we tired of being spoon-fed the lies and mockery parading as music nowadays? I say well done. I like it more and more each time I listen and find something new as time passes.
B001UREJWM|5.0|This is an incredible album. The production is amazing, and it is impossible to believe that Iommi can still sound this good.. but he does. Dio's voice remains fabulous, and his vocal presence is still extremely strong and expressive. I saw him live last year (with Heaven and Hell), and he still has it. All members do, as Iommi, Butler, and Appice lay everyone to waste with class, power, and melody. This isn't a re-imagining of the past - it sounds fresh, new. Still it is undeniably Sabbath. Its uncompromising. AND OBLITERATINGLY HEAVY!! This is the real thing.
0671665707|4.0|The book has some writing problems like you can't tell who's speaking to you at the time. The book is written by a variety of different voices. I loved the movie, Casino. The book fills in a lot of background details of the real-life characters and the movie starring Robert DeNiro, Joe Pesci, and Sharon Stone. DeNiro plays the lead character, Frank Lefty Rosenthal. In the movie, he's Ace Rothstein. Pesci plays Tony Spilotero as Nick who will remind you of Goodfellas role. Stone plays Ginger rather than Geri.  I still find the book interesting especially about how thorough it is in regards to understanding the backgrounds of the mob, Las Vegas, Chicago, and the neighborhoods of Frank \\"Lefty\\" Rosenthal and Tony Spilotero's character. I always watching the movie but I like watching it from the beginning. I can't stand watching it in the middle but Scorsese did an excellent job in maintaining the voices that inspired the movie.
031606792X|2.0|In the words of Edward Cullen...this book was \\"utterly absurd!\\"    What else is there to say, really?  I am in my 30's and, like many others whose reviews I've read, was turned on to this remarkable series by my daughter. I was surprised to find that my nieces in their 20's and my 40 year old sister were also fans. One day, as we were sitting around talking, the series came up in conversation, and we eagerly discussed the upcoming final installment. Everyone began discussing their predictions of what would happen. I jokingly said that on Bella and Edward's honeymoon, she would somehow miraculously get pregnant.  Wow!  Little did I know...    On August 2, 2008, I walked into our local Barnes & Noble, picked my copy of Breaking Dawn off of the huge display, and went home to devour the final piece of this awesome saga. Twelve hours later, as I turned the final page and closed the cover, I looked at my husband (who was waiting for me to finish so he could read it) and said, \\"Horse$&!t.\\" I recently picked the book up again to re-read it, thinking my initial assessment may have been wrong.  Nope.  It was worse the second time.    The beginning of the book had potential.  I know a lot of people have commented on their derision of Bella's...'strong' desire for sex...but honestly, the girl just got married, is having sex for the first time, and is able to have said sex with Edward.  Can you honestly say you wouldn't want to be in bed with him 24/7?!?!?! I think her reaction is understandable.  This aspect of the book didn't bother me at all...she is only human, after all!      However, the book suddenly being written from Jacob's perspective was an unwelcome addition.  I read through these parts as quickly as possible. I believe people who have such an easy time with this aren't immersing themselves in the books the way a \\"good\\" reader does.  I felt like I was schizophrenic, switiching between being inside Bella and Jacob's head.    I absolutely ABHORED that the confrontation between the Cullens & Co. and the Volturi ended with the Volturi tucking their tails between their legs and APOLOGIZING!  WTF???? This was the moment for the epic battle everyone was waiting for!  All of the anticipation and angst...for THIS?     I agree with another reviewer who stated that she understood that Stephenie Meyer wrote Breaking Dawn for herself and she was just heartbroken that it wasn't written for her.  I wholeheartedly concur with this assessment.    Had it been written for me...there would have been some deaths, some sacrifice, some heartbreak, and of course, some happiness.  The very boring, EVERYONE gets a happy ending was just so predictable and lazy! In a nutshell...it was bad!    The abandoned Midnight Sun project needs to be finished. It's ten times better than Twilight.  SM, get over it!  It was leaked.  People still want to read it! Finish it, for God's sake, and redeem yourself after the craptastic failure of Breaking the Hearts of Fans All Over the World.
B001UREJWM|3.0|Instead of writing a long and a boring review, re-telling the band's well-known history, or giving my opion on each song, let me just say that if you like Black Sabbath, you will like this record.     Don't expect it to change your world, but it is guaranteed to rock. The sound is heavy and great. Iommi's playing is beautiful. Geezer fattens the guitar sound very well. Dio does his usuall, solid, semi-operatic singing. Vinnie plays real heavy - like Ward, if you may.     The Best Buy deal includes a dvd, which is a nice touch.    This record is really special for me, because before I bought it, I ran into Tony Iommi on the street and had a brief chat, which made the whole listening experience that much more memorable.
B000P6XU5G|4.0|I love the movie, Rio Bravo.  Have seen it hundreds of times and now after watching it on Blue Ray, I seen things that I'd never noticed before.  Amazing picture quality.  They just gotta get more \\"old\\" standby movies out on Blue........it's like watching a whole new movie.
031606792X|5.0|What an amazing ending to the saga!! Never saw anything in this book coming. MUST READ!! Totally awesome, I did not sleep until I finished this book. I need Stephanie Meyer to write more to this series of books hopefully Between Jacom and Renesme. Who is Renesme you ask.. READ THE BOOK, it is so good!
0937381888|5.0|This is a very well written and organized book. No matter how deep into the subject you want to get this book offers that level of information. If you want to be a casual brewer or you hope to become a master this book is an excellent reference. It is easy to read and has a good glossary.  I was looking for a starter type book and this fit the bill. It is just technical enough to provide in depth information and still read well. Its chapters are arranged thoughtfully and logically...  I recommend it

0763634417|5.0|My 17mth old got hooked up on this book. We had checked it out from the library; however as much as she wanted to read it, we had to make the purchase.  We loved making up voices for all the different fish.  And she loves the video.  She is not big on watching TV/Videos at this point, however this one she can relate to the book, and it is short enough to keep her attention most of the time.  We love it!
B0002YLC24|5.0|This is an enchanting story of two people separated by time and a continent, who essentially don't give up hope. Upon reintroducion they each talk about the circumstances that have transpired during the absence and slowly the story unfolds to one of promise fulfilled.  A must for those enchanted and faithful to a dream.
B001UREJWM|5.0|Better than Mob rules and DH but, not as good as Heaven and Hell.Its really a slower doom album,with the exception of the song \\"Eating cannibals\\" witch has the same speed as Neon Knights.Its really there second best album IMO.

B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I can't stop listening to this fabulous CD set. It is fabulous in every way--Mr. Cohen's amazing poetry, his rich voice, his incomparable fellow musicians, his arrangements, his comments. I just love everything about the CD set and have asked for the DVD for Mother's Day. I think this is the very best album I have ever owned. I've been a Leonard Cohen fan since college in the late 1960s, and although I am sorry his financial troubles caused this CD to be produced, I am very thankful to have this CD to listen to again and again.    If it weren't for a work obligation, I would be in Philadelphia in May for Leonard Cohen's concert. I hope the tour will expand, and I'll get to see him in person at some point.    Update: I did get to see him in person at Madison Square Garden in October 2009. He and his fellow musicians put on quite a show, singing many of the songs on this CD. It was absolutely the best concert I have ever attended, and when I listen to this CD (often), I recall the brilliance and energy of that performance. We had wonderful seats, and with my binoculars, I could see the genuine affection the musicians had for each other. You can hear it, too.

B001TH16DI|5.0|Since Paramount announced the release of the Original Film Set on Blu-ray, the product has been met with massive criticism, some that praised it and others that did not.  Whether this product is a decent buy is contingent upon certain facts, and for the sake of those who just want to know whether this product is a good buy, consider the following:    FACT 1:  All six films starring Kirk and company are being transferred to Blu-ray!  This fact is a great point for those who love the films and the format.  Others have speculated that the only film that would truly be Blu-ray would be \\"The Wraith of Khan,\\" but let's be real; That complaint cannot be proven nor denied at this point, so it is not even relevant.  Paramount would face massive lawsuits if they provided customers with less than \\"advertised\\" product (i.e. recall of \\"Jack Ryan Film Collection\\")    FACT 2:  The theatrical versions are the ones that will be available in this set (except for maybe one)!  One big disappointment for many is that the director's editions are not going to be part of this set.  So what!  Before anyone's eyes even glanced at the director's editions, anyone who called him or herself a fan loved all or certain favorites of the six films in their original, theatrical presentations.  The theatrical versions are just as good as the director's editions so the quality of the film itself is not marred by that restraint.    FACT 3:  $79.99 is a decent price given what buying all six films individually may cost!  Enough said.    FACT 4:  No one has control over your money and how you spend it but you!  Not to sound preachy, but I for one don't like it when people try to sway me in how I should spend my money, and honestly, most of the negative reviews are aiming to do just that. The whole \\"stupid,\\" \\"fool,\\" and \\"conned\\" attitudes are uncalled for.  So, those of you who are looking to buy this product, remember that you can buy what you want.  Make up your own mind, and form your own opinion.  I for one am very interested in this product and am looking forward to adding it into my Blu-ray collection.

B001TOD92C|4.0|Though perhaps not intended, it is a gritty sequel to the original early-1970s film of the same title that co-starred superstar pro wrestlers Verne Gagne and Billy Robinson, the latter portraying a young title contender who was being groomed for the championship by a group of high-powered promoters.<br /><br />Mickey Rourke shows the other side of the business, which earned him a 2009 Golden Globe award and a BAFTA award, and nominations for a Screen Actors Guild Award and an Academy Award, for his portrayal of Randy Robinson, the pro wrestler who has gone from performing in the top venues and major companies to a life of earning a couple hundred bucks before a couple hundred fans - on a good night - with any small-time promoter who is willing to give him a spot on a card.<br /><br />There is an old-school morality play within the confines of a different squared-circle, as Robinson tries hard to reconnect with family and his true self before it's too late. But lurking in the shadows is his biggest opponent; the destructive lifestyle that merges rock-n-roll stardom with the need to perform high-risk stunts to stay a step ahead of the game.<br /><br />One does not have to be a pro wrestling fan to appreciate the battles waged by Robinson, but the demons and trappings are very real and a harsh reminder that the ultimate match occurs after the cheering stops and the lights are dimmed on yet another big show for a tour that never ends.

1595141979|5.0|I stumbled upon the \\"Vampire Academy\\" series by accident, when I spotted the first volume on the \\"new teen fiction\\" shelf in a local public library. I picked it up and from the very first chapter, I was hooked: the characters are life-like and their problems are convincing, and the world-building is so intricate, you swear it's got to be based on something happening just under our noses. This is the kind of teen vampire series that young adults and adults who are young at heart can enjoy, and it just keeps getting more intense and intricate from book to book.<br /><br />Dhampir Rose Hathaway is undergoing a fieldwork analysis before she graduates from St. Vladimir's Acadamy and takes up serving as a guardian to her best friend, Moroi vampire princess Lissa Dragomir. But the strain of recent events may have taken their toll on her, and the bond of the \\"shadow kiss\\" which she shares with Lissa may be the last blow to her indomitable spirit. But it is that indomitable spirit that keeps her fighting to protect her friend... and yet, will it remain unshaken when circumstances force Rose to seek out and kill the one she loves the most?

B00197YZ7M|5.0|Growing up quite near The Bridges of Madison County, I found the book to be quite boring and the movie very laughable.  In fact, I here publicly apologize to all the people crying in the theatre as I laughed out loud through out the entire movie.    Years later, due to a category in a Chick Flick book my daughter gave me, I purchased the DVD and watched it in the privacy of my own home.    With the second viewing I found the movie to be a beautiful story and quite entertaining.  The first time, the decor, the characters, hit too close to home. For some reason I seemed to remember that Meryl Streep's character constantly using the \\"f\\" word. Now, growing up in the area, I found it hysterical that ANYONE could think a farm wife, in that era, no matter where she came from, would even know what that word meant!!  As I said, now I have no idea where I came up with that after the first viewing.    Maybe I didn't like it the first time around because it did remind me too much of my home and my family.  I had only been married a few years, no children at the time, and I am sure none of us want to consider our parent's having those kind of thoughts.    The second time I had been living in Texas longer than I had in Iowa, and have two grown children.  Now I get it and see how it could be possible no matter where you live.    Truly this is a beautiful, endearing story of feelings I think we have all had at some time in our lives.  SEE THIS MOVIE!!  It is well worth it.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Like everyone else, I can't say enough about how fantastic this movie is!  My daughter and I believe that this is THE BEST and most romantic movie, with the best ending...period!  We are great Jane Austen fans with P & P, of course, right up at the top of our list and we also LOVE the new (and old) version of Persuasion.  But I think this one tops them all!  Once we began watching, we could not stop!  The very second the credits from one episode began to roll, we were...\\"hurry up, get the next episode going!\\"  We watched it three times in one weekend!! Then we decided to get it out of the house because it was becoming a problem!:)  So we loaned it to a friend and now can't wait till she returns it.  Richard Armitage is \\"fiercely handsome!\\" The other actors are perfect!  The ending is exquisite and yet, it is a movie that you do not want to end!!

B001R0KH3M|5.0|I don't see how this concert--or the dvd preserving it for us--could have been any better. The audience is having a blast, the performers on stage are obviously enjoying themselves and grooving to the appreciative reception they're given for every song, and Stevie is in great voice.  The music is varied and, though familiar, never stale-sounding; the arrangements are fresh and full-bodied, the performances hot, and the musicians and singers are very cool.  Stevie is one of the greatest singer-songwriters ever, of course, and this great dvd demonstrates that he is, as well, a true master at creating an exciting--and often touching--live concert. And, boy is it live and, thankfully, not a short or rushed set. The audience there, no doubt, paid quite a few pounds each to be royally entertained; you will be too, and for a bargain price! This is how a concert on dvd should be done.

0441009425|4.0|A.Reynold's Revelation Space is, perhaps, the most original product of science fiction in the last 20 years at least since Baxter's Xeele universe. The wrighter brings in the genre a unique and almost genious compination os space opera (mystery, andventure, futuristic technologies, starships and large spans of space and time) with the themes and scientific plausibility of hard science fiction. The basic theme of his books is, ofcourse, the answer to fermi paradox together with a plausible vision of humanity's future in the stars.The prose is not great but it is good. But reynolds is a master in world building in a way that only the old masters of the '50s achieved. The central mystery is trully cosmological nothing less than the mystery of the universe itself. The plot is original and intriguing sometimes even fascinating and it is benefited from Reynolds's use of the relativistic effects of sublight space travel compined with a complicated narrative told from different viewpoints coming from different characters who start in different points in space and time and are gradually converging as the mystery builds in. Some people found the end unsutisfying but it is not an and at all. It is only a provisional end. If you want to apreciate Reynolds's universe you must read all the 3 books in the trilogy plus Chasm city and the novella Galactic North in the short story collection with the same name.  Ali in all it is a tour de force and a trully original and authentic voice in contemporary science fiction litterature.

006135323X|4.0|Did you ever stop to think why your behavior can be so doggone irrational at times?  Perhaps you are someone who walks into a fast food joint and orders a bacon double-cheeseburger, large fries and a Diet Coke.  Now does that make any sense at all?  Do you regret that recent purchase when a salesperson managed to talk you into a product that was much bigger and had many more features than you wanted or needed?  Do you have drawers full of so-called \\"free\\" stuff at home that you never even use?  You are not alone! It would appear that it is really inconsequential whether you are young or old, rich or poor, a high school drop-out or an individual with an advanced degree.  According to author Dan Ariely we are all highly susceptible to this kind of irrational behavior.  Furthermore, manufacturers and retailers are well aware of these tendencies among their customers and have developed rather sophisticated techniques to take full advantage of them.  In his new book \\"Predictably Irrational:  The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions\\" Ariely seeks to arm his readers with useful information and observations that will help us to understand the forces that are in play here and to ultimately make much better decisions. It is an intriguing subject.<br /><br />Throughout the pages of \\"Predictably Irrational\\" Ariely, a behavioral economist at MIT, discusses a number of fascinating experiments that he and his colleagues conducted in preparation for this book. You will discover that the decisions we make can easily be manipulated by the choices we are presented with.  And although it makes absolutely no sense at all you will see why the more expensive brand name drug will usually make us feel better faster than its generic equivalent.  Ariely also presents some fascinating experiments on the subject of honesty.  Discover why people tend to be appreciably more honest in transactions where cash is involved. Terrific stuff!  Towards the end of the book Ariely spotlights an interesting experiment he conducted involving a group of people ordering food and beverages at a restaurant.  It is stunning when you realize just how much the mere presence of other people can influence what you decide to order!<br /><br />I found \\"Predictably Irrational: The Hidden Forces That Shape Our Decisions\\" to be a particularly engaging and well-written book.  I came away feeling that I had a much better understanding of human nature.  Armed with the knowledge I gained here I am much less likely to be tripped up in future transactions.  I wish I had read this book before my wife and I purchased a vehicle a couple of months ago!  It might have saved us several thousand dollars!

0375826726|5.0|It took me a while to get into it, probably because AP classes don't allow for much free time, but when I did, I loved it! I've always been an Eragon fan, and this one didn't disappoint. Well-written, and full of interesting characters, it's a perfect addition to the already absorbing tale of Eragon and Eldest. My only complaint would be that there wasn't enough Murtagh in it... I suppose I'll have to wait for the last book!    If you love fantasy, and anything to do with dragons, elves, dwarves, etcetera, this is the series for you.  Not to mention Eragon is terribly amusing to make fun of.  So take a bit of time off and settle down with Brisingr.  It'll be worth your trouble.

B00005JPUN|3.0|Maybe I'm easy to please or give a partial pass to genre movies (probably a little of both), but I thought \\"The Invasion\\" was a perfectly good evening's entertainment.  I liked the characters, the story was creepy, and things moved along at a nice clip.  Whatever production difficulties there were, the end result has a coherent, smooth feel, and gets the job done.  We should all remember that there are hundreds of examples of revered movies that had troubled production histories.  Also, I'm guessing that original director Oliver Hirschbiegel couldn't have completely objected to some of the re-shoots and modifications made to his original cut, as he's right there in the special features section sitting next to producer Joel Silver, helping him promote the film.<br /><br />Is \\"The Invasion\\" a perfect movie?  Nah.  It's strange that they hired an Australian actress (Nicole Kidman) and a British actor (Daniel Craig) and then had them both supress their accents to play Americans.  But they're otherwise good in the film, projecting tense involvement in the plot (as a quick aside, it was also kind of funny and a bit disorienting to see Mr. Craig acting alongside Jeffrey Wright, knowing they both were filming the James Bond film \\"Casino Royale\\" about that time).  The message was a little naive, too, if the producers were seriously suggesting that it might be okay if we all lost our emotions and passion if it meant an end to world conflicts.  But the idea wasn't pushed too hard, only suggested, so I won't make too much of an issue over that.<br /><br />Plusses include some good action, creepy transformation make-up, and a genuinely scary, repulsive way the infected try to spread the virus (which some reviewers here have counted as a negative aspect of the movie, which I think is a strange thing to say about a film that's supposed to frighten us).  On the DVD, sharp picture and sound, and a handful of interesting extra features, further put this one over the top.<br /><br />I wouldn't rush to make \\"The Invasion\\" part of your DVD library, but as a rental or something you run across in the TV listings, it's worth your time.  It might even be worth buying if you get a really good deal.<br /><br />As a final thought, I'm not sure that I needed to watch the \\"The Invasion\\", with its heavy metaphor for the aggressive spread of deadly new diseases and viral strains and our fear of same, just as the current swine flu pandemic is reaching crisis proportions.  That was one bit of filmic realism I could have done without.The Invasion\\" part of your DVD library, but as a rental or something you run across in the TV listings, it's worth your time.

B001IBIQU6|1.0|Here we have it. Finally, after a decade trying to find their own lost identity, they've done it- they've retrieved their musical roots. And this is their masterpiece. The consummation of the disaster.    When in 1982 Alan Wilder was recruited to be part of DM, the band was destined to be just another of hundreds of brit-pop new-romantic bands that were around. When, thirteen years after that point he left them, they were an icon. They've created a new musical style. They were one of the most influential bands standing in their time. Fourteen years after that, the remaining members, now in their 50's, have just returned to the point they were 27 years before. And they've done it with a terrible bad taste. Unbelievable.     The album, musically speaking, is a black hole. Not only it is a nullity, but also absorbs and destroys any idea you had on music before, while you're listening to it. Having it playing in the radio is obscene. Voices and chorus, simply horrendous. Only in \\"peace\\" they sound a bit coordinated. The impressions i had while listening to it was some sense of nervous irritability mixed with pity and shame. I just can't believe they've dared to make this. I would never have believed they could go so far. I feel ashamed of putting this mockery in public. Instrumentals, a nintendo sonnerie.     Total collapse.
1440468397|5.0|I am not quite sure why Persuasion is not quite as good as  Sense and Sensibility or Pride and Prejudice.  It is a well constructed  story, and if anything, the secondary characters are more amusing  than those in her other novels.  However, the main characters  are just  too restrained (maybe repressed is a better word  here).  Their exchanges, and frequently lack thereof, makes it a bit  frustrating. However, this is still an excellent read - entertaining   from start to finish.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers of Catan is a great light game with more thought required than your average Monopoly game but far less than say with Caylus.<br /><br />The basics:<br />1. The board is made up of hexes that form an island. Each player is playing a settler of the island and starts off playing placing settlements (or settlements and cities if playing by tournament rules) at the corners of these hexes and placing roads along the sides of the hexes.<br />2. At the start of each turn, the dice are rolled. As long as a 7 isn't rolled, everyone who has a settlement or city adjacent to a hex that has the # that was rolled collects the appropriate resource. (Settlements give 1 of that resource, cities give 2 of that resource.) If a 7 is rolled, the robber is activated and the roller of the dice gets to move the robber to a new hex, which shuts it down (doesn't produce resources while the robber is there) and allows the person to steal a resouce card from anyone who has a settlement/city adjacent to that hex.<br />3. After collecting resources, people can offer trades of resources to the active player (whomever rolled the dice) or the active player can trade them in to the bank at a 4:1 ratio (trade in 4 of the same resource to get 1 other one back) or use a port (generally offers either 3:1 trades or 2 of a specific resource:1). The active player can then buy settlements, roads, cities, or bonus cards (give extra pts., resources, or ability to move the robber without having to roll the dice). The dice are then passed on to the next player who becomes the active player.<br />4. The game is played to 10 pts. Settlements = 1 pt. each, cities = 2 pts. each, plus some bonus cards and special circumstances (ex. having the longest contiguous road on the board is worth 2 extra pts.).<br />5. The game is for 3 or 4 players but you can get an expansion that will allows up to 6 to play it.<br /><br />It is a really light game that is a lot of fun. The board is not fixed, so for each new game, you can \\"build\\" a new island with different configurations. It's a great social game that I've played in a tournament setting as well as with my nieces as it is very easy to pick up. Unlike Monopoly, which just drags on, this has a clear end point (10 pts.), which isn't hard to acquire. Even if no player will trade with you, you can always trade with the bank or a port, so there is never really a situation of being denied a resource (just a question of how economically feasible it is to get said resource). It isn't as deep as a game like Caylus and doesn't take anywhere near as long to play.<br /><br />Bottom line: If you're looking for something a bit more engaging than Monopoly, this probably is the game for you. It still allows luck to play a factor (w/ dice rolling) but doesn't generally dominate the outcome of the game. It offers a lot of player interaction and is great for both new and seasoned gamers.different configurations.

B001TH16DI|5.0|Haven't gotten the set yet but I am very much looking foward to this because, simply, the theatrical cuts are the best particularly Star Trek VI - FINALLY in 2:35 to 1 - no more of that 2:20 business.  I saw that film opening night back in '91 and it always played much better than the lame director's cut.  They only cut five minutes out but it is probably some of the dumbest minutes ever in Star Trek.      The additions to Wrath of Khan are not as heinous but they pretty much stink too.    Also, the fans should stop complaining - Paramount has had an amazing track record on Blu-Ray with The Godfather, Iron-Man, Indy IV, and ST season 1 - they're not going to blow it.
B00155GDXC|5.0|On the next to last page, the Pakistani Princeton-educated narrator, says, \\"I have felt rather like a Kurtz waiting for his Marlowe.\\" This allusion to Heart of Darkness is very illuminating, as Hamid's book bears several similarities to Conrad's novel. First, the narrator is telling his story to an unidentified stranger, although in this case the narrator is the Kurtz-like character. More telling, though, is the fact that Changez's story is that of a star team player run amok. The revelation at the end will tell you who is the Marlowe character and will make you want to reread the novel. The title is a little puzzling, since Changez is encouraged in his New York job to focus on fundamentals. He is, however, never reluctant in that regard. He is either totally gung-ho or totally apathetic. I think he is \\"reluctant\\" to abandon his American lifestyle to re-engage with his \\"fundamental\\" Pakistani roots, but 9/11 and the U.S. response to that tragedy have a sudden and jarring impact on his perspective. I'm not sure, either, what purpose his girlfriend Erica serves, as she loses her own way in her grief for a lost love. Perhaps she is a metaphor for the U.S. in its post-9/11 grief, but my biggest complaint about the book is that no clear explanation is given for Changez's obsession with her. I suppose that he just longs for something he can never have, just as he can never fully blend in with lighter-skinned Americans. All symbolism aside, the rhythm of the prose somehow evokes the narrator's heritage and builds suspense, right up until the last sentence. There is also some clever wordplay that made me smile, such as \\"Maximum return was the maxim to which we returned, time and again.\\"
B000X5SPBI|5.0|My sister has been watching this show since day one.  She always wanted me to watch it.  The problem is...I don't like werewolves, vampires, witches, etc, etc.  So no matter what she said to me I wouldn't watch it.  She tried to tantalize me with \\"Supernatural\\" clips on You Tube.  I resisted.  The one she showed me was bloody and gory.  I upchuck if some one gets a paper cut on TV.  I'm very sensitive.  She showed me shots of the stars.  \\"Aren't they gorgeous?  They're southern guys like Daddy.\\" Another pathetic attempt to get me to watch...bringing up our late father! \\"Oh, that Dean guy is so pompous!\\"  I said. Finally, this year she showed me a very funny clip. Well, the humor got through to me.  I finally watched an episode.  Made my husband watch, too. I was hooked.  I then bought this DVD. Then Season 2, then Season 1.  Well, I can only say the show is stupendous.  The stars have an such an intense chemistry, I feel like I'm watching a reality show and I'm voyeuristically watching two brothers who happen to fight creepy dangerous things.  I know the actors who play these guys say the TV schedule doesn't leave much time for prep or working on their characters...all I have to say is....it's amazing just the way it is. Don't change ANYTHING!  The guys are dry and funny when they need to be and powerful and emotional during the serious scenes.  And the writing!  These people are obviously the best that the TV or movie industry has to offer.  They make me laugh and cry and cover my eyes and on last week's show \\"Jump the Shark\\", ALMOST BARF!  I, the avowed monster-hater, now talk of things like Wendigos, Strigas, Devas and oh-so-many-others.  I, an actor-snob, who believes that most pretty-boy actors can't act, have been proven wrong by two guys who have taken me on an amazing journey that I am thoroughly enjoying.  Buy this.

B000NA77YO|5.0|Finsally we are able to get a Dio era Black Sabbath collection.  Ronnie James Dio is an unparalled singer in this genre.....    The 3 new tunes alone are worth the price of admission.  They clearly show that this incarnation of Black Sabbath, currently on their 3rd reunion of sorts (early 80's, early 90's, and now here in the new millenuim) is a force to be reckoned with....    Can't wait for the new full length album \\"The Devil You Know\\" (being billed as Heaven & Hell for the name of the band).  Apparently Tony Iommi & Geezer Butler wanted to keep the Ozzy Osbourne fronted incarnation of  Black Sabbath on the sidelines (unlike when Dio first came to the band -to \\"replace\\" Ozzy).

B000001FV1|5.0|Considering the fact that this was their next to last album Traffic were really still riding on full throttle. The title track is the most impressive aspect of the album;rather then a guitar solo-drenched free for all Jim Capaldi and Rebop Kwaky Baah that ends up being more on the Afro-funk side of things then a art rock/fusion jam.As for that the rest of the album-particularly the lightly grooving \\"Roll Right Stones\\". A heavy gospel feel goes across the slow,softly soulful \\"Evening Blue\\" and \\"Tragic Magic\\" wheras \\"Sometimes I Feel So Uninspired\\" really brings out that bluesy organ of Winwood's.About Steve Winwood's presense on this album his singing isn't as theatrical as it had been in the past and would be on future offerings-it's a lot more sudtle and other times seems to trail off entirely. It ends up being not only a near closer to Traffic's career as a band but something of a transtional phase in Winwood's development;his interest in soul music had began to move from the gospel styles of his 60's/early 70's music but into the communal,spare funk style of 70's soul. As with Talking Heads and Bozz Scaggs, Steve Winwood was one of the few artists who made the transition into the influence of the 70's and 80's R&B/soul rather then just concentrate on doo-wop/gospel styles. True the pychedelic inflections of earlier Traffic is missing from this but in terms of the musicians and their intent this album really makes the absolute best use of what it was hoping to say to the listener.

1416550542|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed every page of \\"The Forgotten Garden\\".  This book sat on top of my stack of books to read for several weeks until I felt I had time to really get into a book of this size.  The only problem I had once I started this book was finding time for other things I needed to do.  It is a book you won't want to put down once you've started it!    The book  begins with four year old Nell left alone on a ship going to Australia.   The story of who she is and why she was on the ship leads us to several countries and spans a period of nearly a hundred years.  The chapters  alternate between the early 1900's, the 1970's and 2005.  There are many interesting characters, who make this mysterious novel a true delight.  Just when you think that you have figured out the plot another twist is thrown in, each making the story more intriguing.
B0000844IT|4.0|Sam Raimi's third installment to the Evil Dead franchise is bigger in scale. Obviously the bigger budget was an improvement needed from some of the cheesy effects  used in the last two films. The same stylized cinematography remains in this film. But this film is differs from the other two. The first one is pure horror/gore film. The second although gory, was more of a stale spoof. This one takes the glory of the first film, and at moments where the second failed and succeeded.     Army of Darkness is a great clash of horror and comedy. And is recommended for fans of the franchise, Sam Raimi, Bruce Campbell and even those who are fans of Tales of the Crypt. This version of the DVD includes both the Director's Cut and the Theatrical Cut. Even though the Director's Cut contains footage that was not either digitally re-mastered, or on that matter, fully processed from the original master, it is still interesting to see what didn't make in the original cut.     This is definitely recommended for any fans of the Evil Dead series
0553573411|1.0|(WARNING, SPOILERS!)<br /><br />I always finish any series that I start. I can honestly say that I've never regretted this policy so much as when I was reading Robin Hobb's supposed &#34;Assassin&#34; books.<br /><br />The problems that plagued Assassin's Apprentice remain. However, it Royal Assassin, a new problem has arisen, namely, the characterization. Molly is probably the best example. I could almost see the strings that Hobb was using to direct her bizarre actions to whatever she wanted her to do. She was like a puppet being directed around for the sake of setting up a ridiculous and melodramatic romance story that went nowhere. She breaks up with Fitz because of petty misunderstandings on both ends, he does more whining and angsting, he breaks into her room at night (!) to make sure that the Spoiled Palace Brat hasn't killed her, she catches him, and suddenly she forgives him everything and falls into his arms. (What is this? Twilight? Why do I keep reading authors who think that this creepy stalker behavior is so hot?)<br /><br />Rinse and repeat. They develop a relationship that follows the same formulaic pattern throughout the book: Molly gets pissed off at Fitz, he angsts, he talks to her, and she suddenly melts into his arms and everything's okay, without any resolution as to why she is suddenly fine with what had previously driven her away from him. If this isn't the most golden hodgepodge of abrupt character development, horrendous dialogue, and bad writing in the world of literature, I don't know what is.<br /><br />I counted seven(!!!) fade-to-black scenes in this book. Of course, they are all very modestly described. When one of them commenses, Fitz stops narrating what's happening and recites some obscure poetry, monologues that scream, &#34;CENSORED, CENSORED, CENSORED.&#34; Hey, Mrs. Hobb, why not just say Fitz is having hawt secks and be done with it?<br /><br />Of course, all that is just one example. Burrich, Kettricken, Shrewd, and Verity seem to have forsaken their traditional archetypes in favor of inconsistent behavior that makes them seem like more puppets on strings rather than actual characters. One shining example: The main characters' lives are threatened again and again, but they refuse to take action because, &#34;The King didn't order it.&#34; Well, the King didn't exactly give his stamp of approval to you sleeping with one of the servants, did he, Fitz?<br /><br />Another one of my favorite examples: It is repeatedly hammered into the heads of the readers that it is not possible to be a King's man and to have a wife or significant other at the same time. This is absurd. We know from Fitz's life that being a King's man does not require his 24/7 attention, and I think loyalty to your monarch is a good deal different from romantic pursuits on the side. Royal Assassin would have been better off with this preachy nonsense removed.<br /><br />The plot is also screwed up. The beginning starts at a snail's pace, with little or no premise to the coming conflict save that the Raiders are still at it, and remains tortuously boring through half the book. Most of the plot consists of Fitz making his rounds to the different people of the Keep and chatting them up, with virtually no excitement happening save for some Forged Ones appearing around Buckkeep, which wasn't that exciting anyway.<br /><br />&#34;But,&#34; the bizarre fans of this series will argue, &#34;this is a CHARACTER driven story! It's all about the intrigue!&#34; Well, the intrigue isn't that good. You want to know what the intrigue in this book is about? Basically, 95% of all the &#34;intrigue&#34; in this book boils down to one of two things: Either the Red-Ships are causing trouble, or Prince Regal is up to no good. Even the few times I thought I glimpsed something that might be an original twist, it turned out that Regal was again the mastermind in the shadows.<br /><br />Question raised: Why isn't the Skill working for Fitz? Is it because he tampered with forbidden magic?<br /><br />Answer given: Nope. Regal had one of his cronies, Galen, damage it with his Skill.<br /><br />Q: Why did Kettricken slip and fall on the stairs?<br /><br />A: Regal greased them.<br /><br />Q: Why was Verity able to leave on his quest so easily?<br /><br />A: Regal supported this move so he could snatch the throne while Verity was gone.<br /><br />Q: Why haven't the Skill messages from the coast reached Buckkeep in time?<br /><br />A: Regal has taken control of the Skill network and is using it to his own ends.<br /><br />Q: Why is King Shrewd wasting away? Sickness?<br /><br />A: Nope. Regal had two of his minions skill-drain him.<br /><br />Repeat this over and over again throughout the entire book: The Spoiled Palace Brat is behind everything. I wouldn't be surprised if, in the third book, it was revealed that he's secretly working with the Raiders.<br /><br />In conclusion, Royal Assassin isn't any better than the first book, and if anything, worse. The last 50 pages were defintely the best in the book, but just weren't enough to make up for the +600 pages I suffered through to get to them. It was satisfying, however, to get to see the Spoiled Palace Brat beat the s**t out of the King of Angst at the end. ; )

B001TOD9VI|5.0|It's not often that near-perfect movies are made.  Darren Aronofsky's The Wrestler is a near-perfect movie.  In somewhat of a departure from his earlier films (Pi, Requiem for a Dream, The Fountain), Aronofsky offers a glimpse into the life of an aging pro-wrestler, a glimpse so real and human that the line between fiction and documentary is hard to discern.<br /><br />The Wrestler tells the story of Randy \\"The Ram\\" Robinson (Mickey Rourke), a former professional wrestling superstar still trying to hold on to the glory days of the 1980s.  His fame in the 80s, however, came at a price.  He alienated his daughter, put his body through hell, filled it with poison, and now lives in a trailer park as he struggles to keep on living while still feeding his old addictions.  \\"The Ram's\\" only friend is a stripper named Cassidy (Marisa Tomei), also an aging \\"star\\" in her profession trying to survive in a culture that increasingly rejects her.<br /><br />Though the story is a bit clich&eacute;, reminiscent of the last couple installments of the Rocky franchise, it's never been told quite like this.  With Rocky, the audience knows the outcome ahead of time.  The Wrestler keeps us guessing until the final credits start to roll.  Along the way the audience is taken on the ups and downs that Randy \\"The Ram\\" experiences as he tries to find life outside the ring.<br /><br />The uniqueness of this film comes through the parallels between Randy and Cassidy.  Again, both are aging stars in industries that value youth and vitality.  Both live double lives.  Both exploit their bodies so they can feel loved and wanted.  Both are empty and lonely looking for fulfillment and rescue from their lives as they are.  But neither really knows how to go about finding that fulfillment and rescue.  Randy tries to hold blue collar jobs at a local grocer, first unloading trucks then working behind the meat counter, but the appreciation he is given there, or isn't given, simply does not compare to the thrills of screaming fans and chants of \\"Ram Jam, Ram Jam.\\"  Cassidy is trying to earn and save enough money to buy a new condo, leaving the club and the adult industry behind in order to better provide for and take care of her growing son.  She remains bound, however, to the club and the need to feel wanted by the men she dances for.<br /><br />The brilliance of this film is the simultaneous juxtaposition of these two characters.  Each represents the redemption of the other, but in order to reach that point they must be united together.  After the big crisis event of the story, there are brief glimmers of hope that they understand this and they begin moving toward that point.  As their relationship grows deeper they struggle with facing new categories.  Are they still dancer/customer?  Are they friends?  Can they be more than friends?  Cassidy helps Randy try to salvage a relationship with his daughter, Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood), Randy gives Cassidy a Randy \\"The Ram\\" action figure to give to her son, and both of their lives seem to be coming together nicely.  Sure there are the normal growing pains of any budding romance including harsh words and hurt, but there are also moments of sweetness and connection that make the trials of relationship vanish in an instant.<br /><br />The film reaches its climax when these two \\"broken down piece[s] of meat,\\" as Randy describes himself, must make the decision between the two lives that each lead.  Will Cassidy give up dancing and live the rest of her life as Pam (her real name)?  Will Randy \\"The Ram\\" leave the brutal world of professional wrestling and accept that Robin Ramzinski is who he really is?  The cost for both Randy and Cassidy is the sacrificing of a significant part of who they are and who they have been for years, but the reward for such a redemptive sacrifice is the beginning of a new life together, a life which will bring the true love and fulfillment that each are looking for.<br /><br />Without giving away the ending, I will simply say that the way in which the story resolves is quite striking and further solidifies this film as an incredible piece of art.  The Wrestler is a very remarkable film that deserved all (and more!) of the award nominations it received this year.<br /><br />Video/Audio<br /><br />The video on the Blu-ray release of this film is quite good, presented in anamorphic 2:35.  Originally shot in 16mm, the picture has a washed-out, grainy feel to it, but this was a deliberate move by the filmmakers to give it more of a documentary look and feel.  The audio is also done very well, presented in 5.1 DTS.  The hair metal music used throughout the film is pulse-pounding, and the crowds of the wrestling matches surround you, making you feel as if you are actually there watching the show.<br /><br />Special Features<br /><br />The special features for this release are somewhat disappointing, simply because there aren't that many.  There is a music video for the Bruce Springsteen song, \\"The Wrestler\\" (how was this not nominated for a Best Song Oscar??), and two featurettes looking behind the scenes at the professional wrestling industry.  The Blu-ray release also includes a digital copy of the film on a second disc.  That's all there is, however.  It would have been nice for deleted scenes or a feature-length commentary to have been included.which the story resolves is quite striking and further solidifies this film as an incredible piece of art.

B00006B1HH|3.0|The beginning of the movie all the heads were cut off, and had a little trouble getting it to start to play.  Once it got going then it was ok.
0596101996|5.0|A fantastically complete reference to Javascript.  This is not a \\"learn Javascript\\" book, however - but a reference.  The examples are not as detailed as in other \\"learning\\" books - but as a reference guide it cannot be beat.  It is extremely rare that I can't find what I'm looking for in that book.  I am using the 5th edition of the book, which is much better than the older editions - and I feel is the new standard for what should be called a \\"Definitive Guide\\".  Pitfalls, quirks, browser differences and a complete (as of 2006 at least) property/function reference for both core and DOM javascript objects.  Highly recommended.
B00151A6TI|4.0|Although I already own and like Sleeping In Traffic: Part One, I was a little hesitant to buy this follow-up after reading the very mixed reviews here. But after buying it and listening many times, I find myself pretty much in the camp of those who like it best. I even like it slightly more than I like the first!  Prog fans should be delighted with both Beardfish and with Sleeping In Traffic: Part Two. This \\"night story\\" is bracketed by two short instrumentals representing sunset and sunrise. Between the two is a delightful melange of modern prog that takes the listener on one wild musical journey. My favorites are: Into The Night, with the insistent pulsing organ work that drives much of the song; The Hunter, with its relentless drive; the many-faceted and often Zappa-esque South of the Border; Cashflow, a rousing instrumental interlude; and Sleeping In Traffic, a true prog epic that is fragmented musically but unified thematically.  The CD is supplemented with an attractive booklet containing album notes, lyrics, and useful commentary by Rikard Sjoblom. Forget the belly-aching some do about Frank Zappa, there are only a couple of overt points of Zappa-esque musical references in this work and those are confined to two cuts. If you like adventurous music with the capacity to surprise at every turn, then Sleeping In Traffic: Part Two is something you should hear in its entirety.
B001R7IHA0|5.0|I really like Keith's latest album.  It reflects his happy home life.  This is written by a man who loves his wife and child and is not afraid to share it with the world.  The music is more like his earlier successful CD's.  Enjoy!
B00140PK6O|4.0|First I'd like to say that this is such a wonderful story!!  I've watched it a few times and each time I discover something new.  What a fabulous group of characters and how their lives intertwine in a small village. I hear that they may make a sequel and I can hardly wait!!!    Now the bad news:  I should have purchased it through [...].  Why?  It comes in 2 discs and EACH time you view EACH disc you have to sit through 5-10 minutes of commercials from the BBC.  On any other DVD that I've purchased, you can fast forward to get to the Menu.  With this one you cannot do that.      Honestly, here I am paying for a DVD and I still have to watch advertisements.      The other thing I found frustrating with the actual viewing is the sound editing.  Very poor!  I had to go back on more than one occasion to try and hear what the actors were saying.  It's a combination of the actors talking way too fast and the microphone not catching everything they say.    On the whole, you will be captivated and transported to this wonderful town and its people.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|This DVD was as enjoyable as it was when I saw it as a small child.  My grandson wanted to see it again and again and asked lots of questions.  We had some good conversations following the viewing (at least 8 times in 2 weeks).
B000KJTC5A|5.0|Good old movie. One that is hard to find but good to watch over and over again. Picture quality very good. Shipping a little costly.
B000TEUSJU|3.0|Honestly, as bad as this excuse for cinema was in as much as it tried to be both a biopic and a skin flick, I really didn't hate it. Malcom MacDowell (the reason I watched it to begin with) is fascinating onscreen and always brims with a kind of unrestrained energy in his roles. For Caligula this was a perfect match as his mad dottering around and over the top virtuosity led very much to being a fine Caligula. Of note especially, the scene with the newlyweds recalled his performance of Alex with the same kind of smug cruelty on his face. Aside from everything else, I honestly think Caligula himself would be pleased at this unrestrained, slightly off picture.
B0024F08RO|1.0|Ok, my opinion is that Prison Break season one is the best season of any TV show of all time!  I could not stop watching it!!!  Buy season 1!  Season 2 was only entertaining to me because I was already attached the the characters.  Season 3 was a little better than season 2, but season 4 should have never happened.  This season makes the first 3 seasons seem pointless!  As a true Prison Break fan, I recommend seasons 1-3 in that order.  This season was a sorry excuse to drag the series into a last ditch effort for more money.  FLOP!!!
B00005JPSM|3.0|There's nothing surprising or new about this movie at all - watching it may give you a sense of d&eacute;j&agrave;-vu, even if you've never seen it before.  All the elements are simply recycled feel-good romantic comedy bits.  Still, it doesn't make it a horrible movie, just a predictable one.<br /><br />The actors do a good job with the characters (especially the 'ice queen' of a heroine), the dialogue is fun, and the story moves nicely, even if you do know what's about to happen.  It is a quintessential 'chick flick'.  Boy meets girl, girl dislikes boy, boy and girl squabble, boy and girl fall madly in love.  The cooking and child made for an interesting backdrop to the story, but it still rates solidly as an 'okay' movie.  One you might put in a set of rainy Sunday afternoon feel-good movies, though it might not make the cut over some of the more charming movie of this genre.
0156711427|5.0|I got this book within days of placing the order, and it came in better condition than expected.  It was like buying a brand new book for a third of the price.
0321344758|4.0|Pros:  I like this book because it is short and to the point. It offers practical advice with \\"what to do\\" as well as \\"what not to do\\" explanations.    Cons:  The book is a little dated as far as the websites they choose to profile, but the ideas behind everything are still valid. There are some things that are common sense and can be skipped over.
B001TODCII|5.0|This is a classic Luc Besson film - it's got his fingerprints all over it, even if he only co-wrote and produced it.  No-nonsense, gritty in-your-face action - old school torture and interrogation and subterfuge...this is the film that Quantum of Solace should have been!  Make Liam Neeson James Bond please.  But seriously, it's such a punchy thrill-a-minute film that it makes you almost long for a sequel.  Great direction by Pierre Morel (and a million times better than the dreadful \\"Transporter\\") - the only thing better than this was probably the original Nikita.  I'll say it again: SEQUEL!!<br /><br />The story was especially poignant because it involved family.  While watching this, I also couldn't help feeling sorry for Neeson - who just lost his wife.  RIP Natasha Richardson.<br /><br />Here's to Liam's future.  Great job.<br /><br />POST-SCRIPT 2013:<br />Watched this again on DVD - and it's still a tremendous film  The action is amazing, thanks to killer editing.  TAKEN 2 was released but nowhere as good.  The original was so powerful that the filmmakers couldn't better it.  TAKEN remains one the best action films of all time.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|This collect of songs is nothing short of amazing. PFC proves its whats underneath the skin that counts
1591841992|1.0|Maybe I had too high of expectations, as it was highly anticipated by many of my colleagues. It reads like a mash-up of a how-to-draw book and a biz school case study, which sounds interesting on the surface, but I agree with other reviewers that it bores you to death in practice. The book is unreadable. The cover and the promo blubs make it sound like a fun book with an interesting personality but it doesn't deliver.      I don't see why this is marketed at creative web/business types. If you have ever drawn something on a whiteboard, there 3-5 tips you can pick up in 5 min skimming this at the bookstore that were helpful. The rest is a confidence building bore-fest. A better book for that crowd would be [[ASIN:0471289590 Visual Notes for Architects and Designers]].    The real target for this books seems to be business types who are afraid to pick up a pen and paper. I would recommend this to any colleagues who shy away when I ask them to diagram something for me in a meeting, but for anyone with a modicum of drawing skills this book will be too obvious and too redundant.    I head Dan Roam is a great presenter/facilitator, so maybe a book is just the wrong medium for him.
B001IBIQU6|3.0|I still love the band and will see them perform every time they tour if only to get a chance to hear them perform some of their classic material, but... I yearn for the Depeche Mode of yesteryear.  Call me old-school but even the standard pop songs from Speak & Spell told a better story lyrically.  Melodies are so obviously missing from any of the songs on this latest release.  I have followed the band from their stellar beginnings to now, having left them for a while because I did not care for some of their mid-career releases.  Although, I must admit every album they have ever released did have its share of memorable and commendable songs.  I realize bands must evolve, but for me personally, DM at its most talented stage was very early on, circa 1982.  \\"A Broken Frame\\", which is one of their lesser known and least referenced albums, is all the evidence one needs to conclude that DM was ahead of their time musically and fantastically talented with the synthesizer.  The beautiful melodies, the lyrics, the chorus, the understated vocals of Dave.... simply brilliant.  I can go on and on, but will \\"Leave in Silence\\" for now.
0739368435|5.0|This was a story that I really enjoyed listening to on CD.  The voices of the characters were wonderful and brought each one to life.  These are characters that you care about and want to know what happens to them<br />as the story progresses.<br /><br />I love good books and this was a unique story about a writer looking for new subject material - and, in the way life has of doing, a situation develops that is just perfect!<br /><br />Although the subject matter is sometimes extremely sad with choices people had to make during WWII, the goodness in the characters prevails and makes you feel glad to have known them.<br /><br />It was sad to learn that the author did not live to see her book take off....I hope the niece of the author considers a sequel!
B001KQ4KCW|4.0|Bruno and his family lived in Berlin during World War II.  His father was an officer in the Army.  Bruno was a typical nine-year old - his life revolved around family, friends and school.   When he found Maria, his family's maid, packing up his belongings one day, he discovered that his family was moving.   Bruno was very unhappy at  \\"Out-With\\" (as Bruno called it) at first.  His sister Gretel was three years older than him and they really didn't get along that well, so he had no one to play with.  His father was working and his mother was distant.    From his bedroom window, Bruno could see Auschwitz concentration camp and all the people in it and couldn't understand why they had to stay on their side of the fence and he had to stay on his.  He decided to go exploring one day and encountered a young Polish boy, Shmuel, on the other side of the fence who shares his birthday.  The boys struck up an unlikely friendship and met almost daily to talk.    The Boy in the Striped Pajamas by John Boyne is a great book that will really make you think and leave you teary-eyed and sad.  It's about blind ambition and prejudices and how both can cloud our judgement and affect everyone around us.   I didn't see the ending coming and it left me feeling shocked.  It's written at a Young Adult level, but I'm not sure I would classify it as a Young Adult novel.  Some knowledge of Nazi Germany is required in order to truly understand the book.
0953104907|3.0|This book is ok but I find other building books to be better. Building electric guitars By Martin Koch is a better book.
0316286850|5.0|When I ordered this book I got it in less that 24 hrs.  That was the best delivery I have ever had.  If it is all like that I will use amazon.com more often.  The book is very good and informative and the pictures are excellent.  It did what I need it to do at a very low cost and I bought it new.
0140042520|2.0|OK, I know this is a beat classic, and it was written by Jack Kerouac the patron saint of beat literature. But I gotta say this novel was pretty damn boring.<br />Dhama Bums is another semi-fictional novel based on real events that occurred in Kerouac's life after the events described in On the Road. It's about Kerouac's search for a simple life and Zen Buddhism. The premise sounds interesting enough, but for me it just didn't have anything to offer.<br />I once described Kerouac's classic On The Road as being like an episode of Seinfeld, a show about nothing. Despite the rather non complimentary comparison I thought that novel was very good and I highly recommended it.<br />Dharma Bums was another meandering novel where nothing really happens. I guess one meandering trip for me was enough. As far learning anything about Buddhism through the novel, my guess is that you would learn more from a real Buddhist like the Dalai Lama than a wannabee like Kerouac.
B0000028MA|4.0|If you love grunge you will love this album as well!! Seasons is a masterpiece!!!
B000R7HY0K|1.0|I tried to watch this movie. I really did. But I lost interest about ten minutes into it, and ended up zoning it out unwillingly all three times I've sat down in front of it. What plot there may be is boring, copied stuff, and it's not very well-written. I did not like any of the characters, and the action scenes were average for the genre. It was a total waste of time for me to attempt to watch this movie--I wish I could get those hours back. Pass on this one; there are hundreds of better movies out there.
B001TH16DS|5.0|I've owned Star Trek on DVD before, but I've NEVER seen it look like this!  It's so clean, bright and clear.  The upgrade over the DVD boxsets is remarkable, and the new FX are great too.  A very worthwhile upgrade!
B00008PBZW|4.0|This was a great historical movie. I bought this for my husband and has already seen it a couple of times.
B0013D8LOK|4.0|I thought that the movie was dark with a bit of Tim Burton's dark comedy. His casting again of Helena Bonham Carter and Johnny Depp whom without the movie would not have been so craftily carried out. The casting of Sasha Cohen was hilarious and whom else could have played that part so well? There is blood, but it is so fake. The love story between the young man and Sweeney's daughter was a good distraction. Alan Rickman as usual great.
0446343129|5.0|You won't forget how, step by step, the author described how the refined is NOT good for us; how it was created from the sugar cane, and all the issues behind; you'll see all new deceices started since refined sugar appeared in human society, and how many evidences against it were ignored by the scientific community.  Fantastic book !!
B001M5UDGS|5.0|I simply can not go \\"over the top\\" on how much I love this.  From the simple fact it was designed originally for the web and now it's a DVD to the wonderful Easter eggs.   The music is fantastic for just the \\"movie\\" but the commentary singing soundtrack is just as good with my absolute fave song being on the commentary not the soundtrack.   I also love how it lets you get quickly to the movie w/o sitting through lots of company masterabatory logo's and warnings etc you can't skip past or fast forward through.    Nathan and Niel are both great.     I just wish they had included the \\"commentary\\" songs on the soundtrack cd.
1439138311|4.0|Colm Toibin enters William Trevor territory with this lovely novel about an Irish immigrant's move to Brooklyn in post-World War II America. In spare unhurried prose he covers her experience with the departure from her limited world, a nightmarish crossing, learning to deal with a new job, night school, her boarding house acquaintances and new love.    Those looking for a speedy read will be frustrated by the measured pace of the incidents as well as their unremarkable nature. But in dwelling on the quotidian Toibin evokes an all enveloping reality of time and place and character.    Relationships aren't distorted for melodramatic ends as in \\"The Blackwater Lightship\\", nor is the book as moving or as intellectually and emotionally satisfying as his masterpiece \\"The Master\\". But this is as good an example of a writer's craft in creating a lived-in reality of small engrossing lives as one can find.
B001PPLIFU|1.0|Saw this flick at the theatre when it first came out because I had highly anticipated it. I have never been a fan of the shaky, fast motion camera work (ie Bourne Identity) and this movie is full of it. The story was boring and I quickly started losing interest. It was a terrible letdown as I thought Casino Royale was fantastic. I literally fell asleep in the theatre during this one (I am not joking) it was so boring.    A huge letdown to say the least...    Someone please get a new writer and director (bring back Casino Royale's director!!)
1932907009|5.0|After reading this book and the sequel, \\"Save The Cat! Goes to the Movies,\\" I can say with certainty that these are BY FAR the best screenwriting books around.      As a novelist, I know that all my writing will benefit greatly from Blake Snyder's insights into structure, and  I am looking forward to Blake's third book, applying his structure to novels.      Finally, I also recommend Blake's weekend screenwriting seminar; I just took one in L.A. and it's superb.
0920668364|1.0|I just had to throw this book in the trash.  I don't think it should be read to any child.  It glorifies breaking and entering and intruding upon your child as an adult.  It's just disturbing.
B0016A2FFG|5.0|The Rev. Al Green has indeed made a comeback, and he did it in a big way.  He walked away with two Grammy awards on two of his fantastic groove songs.  They were \\"Stay With Me By The Sea\\" and \\"You Got The Love I Need\\".  If you ask me, his whole CD is a fantastic groove. Just downright banging. I love this album. Once you start listening to it, it's very hard to lay the CD down.  It's just that good.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|As soon as I got my Blu-Ray player I started searching on the internet for the best Blu-Ray discs to own. Obviously Planet Earth was in everyone's list. A must own for any HDTV owner.
0312370849|5.0|I picked this book on a whim knowing nothing about it. It is well written and completely engrossing. We get bits and pieces of the main character's life and then it flashes back to Sarah's story. It is quite suspenseful as well with plot twists. I enjoyed reading about the adult, Julia Jarmond's life and how the whole story developed. I really loved this book although it had me in tears at some parts about the French Police kidnapping Jewish families. It is something that I agree that could be reading education as well as just a great book. It was one of those books that you come away with something. I highly recommend it.
B001NFNFIK|5.0|I've just seen this film in a French cinema and was surprised to read about the problems between Bertrand Tavernier and Tommy Lee Jones. BTW, I recently went along to a lecture Bertrand Tavernier gave about the unknown underground 50s and 60s American films that inspired the French Nouvelle Vague. Tavernier is a smart man (when speaking French!). What he had to say and show was extremely interesting, subtle. But he talks a lot and I gather he doesn't know when to stop talking when he likes something. The organisers had to stop him talking! I've read that Tommy Lee Jones is a quiet, understating man, who says very little to his actors as director. Maybe this is why they couldn't get along? Did Tavernier bore Tommy? At the end of the day, the fruit of the labour is what counts. And this film is, for me, an artistic success. Tommy Lee Jones is excellent and the film is almost like the third part of a trilogy: 3 Funerals, No Country and Electric Mist.      The story is a bit of a winding non event. Do not watch the trailor, they tell you the whole film (the distributors must think their audiences are idiots) But the mood and lingering scent of southern culture in this film is very powerful. They really succeeded in getting a smell and texture into this film. You can almost taste the southern wind. I walked away haunted by this film. No such thing as time. If you like cinema, then definitely have a look. Preferably on a big screen.

I gave this a decent go but what an awful, cheesy, ridiculous, badly written and badly acted bunch of kangaroo dung!<br /><br />Nothing to enjoy here, over the top accents, stupid characters, I wanted them all to die.<br /><br />One of the worst Australian films in record.

B001QOOCTE|5.0|I can't stop watching the videos from this CD and DVD on youtube. I've sent the link to everyone I know and plan to host a showing of the video as soon as it arrives.    Not only is this music incredible, but the film shows the beauty of the planet and a host of truly inspiring people who live on it. Forget fads like Susan Boyle....this stuff will last and show the depth of the human soul.

B000AY74OG|4.0|I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!!  I was hesitant to watch it at first simply due to the fact that it is yet another animated movie out there.  But, from the time the dvd began I could not leave my seat.  It is funny; and has a good story line.  Some of the humor is even directed toward an adult audience. After watching it the first time, I purchased the movie.  I don't think I will ever tire of watching it!!!
B00005JMFQ|4.0|Love, Christmas, London, England<br /><br />Richard Curtis, the talented writer of the very successful Four Weddings and Funeral, Nottting Hill, and Bridget Jones' Diary, and one of Mr. Bean's the creators, wrote and directed Love Actually, and what a directing debut it is. The ultimate romantic dramedy, the film that is not ashamed to be sweet, heartwarming, and outrage romantic. Love Actually talks about love, romances, break-ups, moving on, and does it admirably. This is the film I can watch over and over - during Christmas time or spring time, or summer, and it always brings warmth, humor, laughs, sadness, and yes, Love that is everywhere, just look a little closer. This is the film that makes me smile and even brings the tears to my eyes - all at once. Love Actually gives romantic comedy its good name back. It is a very good movie - sometimes, close to perfect, gorgeous, sweet in the good sense of the word and always lovely.<br /><br />First, and foremost, I admire the film for outstanding (and I mean it) cast. Some of the best British and American and European actors (and there is also simply gorgeous Rodrigo Santoro who deserves a special mention) play twenty or even more Londoners who were hit by the Cupid's arrow during the Christmas season of 2003 in absolutely stunningly looking, lively and bright London. I won't be original if I say that the funniest character belongs to Bill Nighy as once super-famous rock star (in Keith Richard's type) who is making his comeback with an old love song that he is turning in the Christmas super hit. Another outstanding performance belongs to divine Emma Thompson. She brings depth and real emotions into her and Alan Rickman's story of the marriage in crisis. Laura Linney's story of love that was so close and possible but not meant to be was also very well told and acted.<br /><br />This time, Liam Neeson's story as a newly widower with the young step-son who is desperately in love with the most popular girl in school, touched me the most. After recent untimely tragic death of Neeson's wife, the mother of his two sons, Natasha Richardson, the story feels the most poignant and sweetest. The scene during Daniel's wife funeral, his speech celebrating Joanna's life, moved me almost to tears.<br /><br />Yes, it is a long movie and it tells the stories of 20 people or so who all happen to live, work, fell in love, sometimes have their hearts broke in London that I've never seen so bright and lovely as in this picture - perhaps, because the stories start five weeks prior to Christmas and end on Christmas night. With so many intertwining stories, not all of them are equally good. Some could be dropped, leaving the movie shorter, leaner, and perhaps better but even the way it is, Love Actually deserves its place on such top lists as Best of 2003, Favorites, and Favorite Romance. It is beautiful and magical - just like the season during which it takes place.recent untimely tragic death of Neeson's wife, the mother of his two sons, Natasha Richardson, the story feels the most poignant and sweetest.

B001PU8N0I|5.0|This is one of Dickens' lesser known works and is given a wonderful screenplay by Andrew Davies who also did the Pride and Prejudice and Bleak House adaptations for BBC TV.  The novel centers on two characters whose lives are changed when the father of one of them dies and triggers a search for answers from the past.  Much of the storyline is taken from Dickens' personal experiences as a young boy when his father was imprisoned in a debtors prison.  The theme of imprisonment pervades the entire storyline and every character is affected by it in one shape or form (physical, psychological, familial, and societal).  Dickens' satire of the pre-Victorian 1826 English society class snobbery, bureaucracy, and greed are displayed by the characters in this novel.    The original novel was broken into two parts with Arthur Clennam being the primary focus in the first part and Amy Dorrit in the second part.  This adaptation chose to focus on both characters right away instead of following the original novel time line.  There are many great individual performances in this 7 1/2 hours saga.  The two central characters remain unchanged despite financial, family, and social status pressures.  This adaptation blends humor, sorrow, joy, and a mystery embedded in a love story that transcends time and place.  It is a rare TV event to see such a wide ranging emotional and visually impressive presentation.  Many of the questions that people look for answers like who we will live our lives with, what obligations do parents and children have for each other, and how will we live our lives are brought out from this presentation.  This is a timeless series with a timeless message that what really matters in life is not money, status, or power.    I had the opportunity to ask the screenwriter questions on the screenplay adaptation when the series was being broadcast on US TV networks in April 2009.  Mr. Davies changed some of the scenes from the novel to make it with a more contemporary feeland to give the heroine a more dignified and individual character.  The ending of the series also does not follow the novel exactly.  Arthur Clennam gets the answers to his dying father's request in the TV series while the novel leaves some questions unanswered.  Mr. Davies wanted Arthur to have closure and to make for a more emotionally satisfying ending.  The following is taken from Mr. Davies' introduction to the BBC novel edition.    --------------------------------------------------------------------------  I realized that I would have to simplify and clarify the way the characters are introduced, so that the audience could get a sense of how they interrelate.  I also needed to get a handle on the mystery that lies at the heart of the Clennam household.  The mystery goes back into the past, involving characters that are dead before the book begins.  It revolves around a will, a particular bequest, twin brothers, and a tin box that disappears and then reappears, and it culminates by bringing the house down literally.  I had to consider how to translate all this coherently to television, while laying the clues so that the audience can get a shock of recognition when all is revealed.     --------------------------------------------------------------------------    The sets, costumes, background scenery, and acting are all first rate with many familiar British actors/actresses in the cast.  A lot of work and effort was done to make this production so special (the makeup work for the Maggy character took over 2 hours).  The heroine, newcomer Claire Foy, becomes the primary focus of the entire story and deservedly so.  Claire called the making of the series like a \\"special Christmas gift\\".  Kudos to the casting director, Rachel Freck, who brought together a wonderful cast to the series and for her encouragement to Claire Foy which was crucial to her selection for the leading role (she flubbed the first two auditions for the part).  The musical pieces (especially thehaunting opening score with the piano and string instrument and Amy Dorrit's pensive mood music scenes when she was thinking about Arthur or was with him - taken from the Chinese music box) are beautifully matched to the story actions throughout the presentation.  Dickens is mostly known for his more popular works such as Oliver Twist, David Copperfield, A Christmas Carol, and Great Expectations.  Little Dorrit (originally titled \\"Nobody's Fault\\" by Dickens) deserves more wider recognition because its message is one that touches the heart of nearly everyone.  A rich, moving, and touching story excellently presented.  The series is a big departure from what you normally see on TV or in the theaters.
B000V7RS48|5.0|Well...what can I say...the definitive collection of all surfaced so far recordings by La Divina in a luxurious box - a piece of art itself, marvelous design, carefully packaged CDs each in its box with a little booklet unlike the budget version, exquisite book with rare materials, set of rare photos, all marvelously packaged in art-deco style box and envelope...    As for the sound itself - no revelations here, as usual EMI sets sound a little \\"metallic\\" Callas-wise and and besides I did hope they would improve the sound imperfections of La Traviata recording...but well...it is what it is. Anyways, as I didn't purchase this unique set for any discoveries in sound, but rather to have a unique collection of La Callas' recordings which I am now happy to have gotten on time, in perfect condition and with the number certificate confirming that this is a limited edition set which is not going to be reissued...well...now I only wish they released Maria's full live collection (not the abridged 8 CD set they released in 2005)    5 stars for this unprecedented release..I am stunned and happy...
B001PPGAIK|3.0|More bothersome than anything about AUSTRALIA is that it is both mislabeled as a romantic epic and that it seems to try and lead the audience in too many artistic directions. While viewing the trailers for it, I assumed it was another Baz Luhrmann visual-fest (if you've seen [[ASIN:B000077VR3 Moulin Rouge]] you know exactly what I'm talking about).<br /><br />But from the get-go, I got the sense that Luhrmann was trying more to get across a sense of Australia's forgotten history than to entertain us. But then, as the film progressed, the gears of this behemoth began spinning in all different directions at different times. Clocking in at 165 minutes and costing over $130 million, Australia seemed (on the outside) to be headed toward the epic category.<br /><br />The good is that the film (just barely) holds together. Much of that is thanks to Luhrmann who, although he had a tenuous grip on it, delivered an entertaining mesh. The over-the-top acting, line-deliveries, and color schemes are all what we've come to expect from this dynamic director, too.<br /><br />Beginning with the life of an aboriginal half-breed named Nullah (relative unknown Brandon Walters), we initially seem to be headed toward the historical drama fold. Similar in tone to another excellent film you might want to check out entitled [[ASIN:B00005JLD4 Rabbit-Proof Fence]], we are given some background on \\"the lost generation\\" of aborigines who were stolen from their parents and put in \\"white homes\\". But then the story switches to that of Lady Sarah Ashley (Nicole Kidman, [[ASIN:B00139XZF4 The Golden Compass]]), an English woman of noble right who comes looking for her supposedly cheating husband in the back-country of Australia at their ranch known as Faraway Downs. When she arrives, she quickly meets up with the ruggedly handsome and ruggedly tough Drover (Hugh Jackman, [[ASIN:B000O7667K The Fountain]]) who guides her to Faraway Downs only to discover that her husband has been murdered, the ranch on the verge of collapse, and a group of aborigines hiding in fear of the local constabulary (among them is Nullah). The \\"I-despise-you-but-eventually-fall-in-love-with-you\\" story will not surprise anyone. And seeing Jackman and Kidman together is pretty easy on the eyes. But then a new wheel finds a cog and we're thrust into the middle of WW II. Oh. And did I mention that Nullah's grandfather is a medicine man and wants Nullah to follow in his footsteps? And that the main antagonist in the film is Nullah's white father? And that a businessman in the area wants to steal Faraway Downs from Lady Ashley? And all of this happens during a cattle drive? Whoa!<br /><br />To be even more brutally honest, there are a host of other things going on, too, which further muddies the waters. The astonishing thing, though, is that the film remains entertaining despite all of these threads. Kidman and Jackman's chemistry is very believable. And young Brandon Walters delivers an endearing role as the lost half-breed. The scenery, too, is astounding, with rich color sequences that follow sepia tones.<br /><br />It could've been better by settling on a few less plot threads. But it is what it is. And I'm glad I watched it. But if you want a true history lesson on \\"the lost generation\\" in Australia, pick up [[ASIN:B00005JLD4 Rabbit-Proof Fence]]., and a group of aborigines hiding in fear of the local constabulary (among them is Nullah).

B00003CXE7|5.0|I think that this movie is by far one of the greatest movies Russel Crowe has done.  His performance is excellent and the storyline just moved me.  It was great how a man who was once a General leading the Roman Empire to victory could become a slave and forgotten.  Then return as a Gladiator and steal the hearts of the Roman Empire once again.<br /><br />The ending is moving but he is home with his family!  The Best!
B000LY5QQS|3.0|This could possibly be a flagship in newer Bond films: action saturated more than packed, with the due amount of suspence and rhythm, with spectacular stunts and gadgets, beautiful women and two (plus a third minor one) bigger than life villains.<br /><br />The plot is the usual, indifferent pretext: a media mogul, duly crazed, wants absolute power and is efficiently portrayed by a Jonathan Pryce who seems to be having tons of fun.<br />The comparative novelty is that the enemy power is not Russia but China, but this is little change: the only consequence of import is that one of the two female leads is beautiful -and quite athletic- Michelle Yeoh who, for once, is nearly as deadly as Bond himself in the role of a Chinese secret service colonel. She makes the most of her role (not well served by a superficial script) and is beautiful to look at: no one could legitimately ask for more.<br /><br />The other female lead is the aristocratic beauty of Teri Hatcher, a former lover of 007. Hers is perhaps the only well rounded character: her love for Bond seems genuine and once in a while James seems to return her affection. She's a competent actress and the filming director makes the most not only of a flawless body but also of her sensitive face.<br /><br />This not a masterpiece for sure, but fans will hardly find anything wrong in a film that begins with a breathtaking opening sequence and runs to its end without skipping a single beat.

B00153ZRHM|5.0|I really had almost no interest in watching this movie when my teenage son recommended it.  What brought me around was that this does not seem at all like his kind of movie and yet he was insistent that we see it.<br /><br />So I watched.<br /><br />I still get chills up my spine just thinking about this film: it was that powerful.  Filled with plot twists, taut psychological tension and beautiful cinematography, this really is a one-of-a-kind film.  Don't categorize it as a \\"period piece\\" or boring set-piece drama (like I did). If you appreciate excellence in the craft of film, you owe it to yourself to see this movie.  You'll be talking about it - and laughing - for days afterward.
B000BZISTE|1.0|I love the TV series MASH, and was genuinely looking forward to watching the film. Sadly both my friend and I sat in stunned silence through the film, which was (1) not funny unless you find a man stepping on a rake and hitting himself in the face hilarious, (2) disgustingly misogynistic (from the way Hotlips was treated  - first as a prude who needed to be brought down a few notches, and then as a nincompoop, to the other female characters (nurses in both the MASH unit and in Tokyo, and the prostitutes in Tokyo)), and to top it all off (3) racist and (4) anti-homosexual.     Perhaps some will say I am ignoring the fact that this is a black comedy, meant to be disrespectful and brash. If that is the case, I will happily remain in my cocoon of ignorance.
B001DHXT6G|4.0|The quality of the DVD's are quite good, though a few parts of episodes are a bit grainy. This is probably due to the poor condition of what they had to work with. Most is very good, and some is stunning in quality. The redone exterior shots and added effects blend very well with the original material. The reason I didn't give the set 5 stars is the packaging.The outer case is poorly designed and the little alignment tabs that are supposed to keep it shut will break off in about three openings.Than the DVD's themselves are in a sort of book with plastic leaves that the discs pop into. Everytime you want to look at a particular episode you have look at some seperate cards and than leaf through this contraption to find the disc you want. This forces you to handle them way too much and they can, and do pop out. Don't get me wrong if you like Star Trek you must have this. It's just that for this kind of money the containers are JUNK !    RFZ
B001GSV3EC|5.0|I don't have the time to break this thing down track by track, but suffice it to say, GET THIS! It's not without a few missed notes by Beck and Tal, but the spontaneity(sp?)is wonderful. The rich production and \\"in your face\\" sound has me pleased. Some old tunes, some newer ones, and a couple covers. I only wish they would have done \\"Stand On It\\", but you can't have it all. For a thrill, check out the you tube videos of these perfomances to actually see the man work his magic, and a great backing band. Or do like me and get the dvd. Folks, Jeff IS the most interesting rock guitarist and has been forever, but he's getting up there in age.(you wouldn't be able to tell here, though)  Someday he may hang it up for good. Buy this and the dvd now.

B001DTPZNY|4.0|How would you follow a movie such as Raiders of the Lost Ark?  Its huge success seemed to suggest people loved the escape from humdrum lives, routines, etc, evidenced by embracing a movie in which you had to suspend disbelief a mere few moments into the story; a movie which abandoned itself to cartoonery before the first thirty minutes was up...you would indeed be faced with a dilemma:  if we introduce the same swashbuckling stunts, the new movie will be slammed as replete with banal recreations of the original; yet if we exercise restraint with the death-defying scenes, another demographic will bemoan the fact that all the elements of Indiana Jones are painfully missing from the new outing!  Crystal Skull did a pretty good job of revisiting what made the first movie so memorable, while saddled with baggage Raiders didn't have:  In 1981, nobody had made a movie with such unbelievable feats, bombastic music and incredibly fast pacing.  I remember just a couple of moments in Raiders where you had the chance to catch your breath!  We have all long since become accustomed to fast-paced, violent movies, to the extent that attempting to resurrect the \\"magic\\" of the first movie  ( PLUS the fact that, for a lot of us, Raiders has had 28 years to 'mellow' like fine wine ) is a daunting, if not impossible task.  There was nothing more unbelievable in Crystal Skull than in Raiders of the Lost Ark...Crystal just had the unenviable position of attempting to at least recreate, if not surpass, the allure and swashbuckling flair of the original.  A swordfight conducted between two people standing on a couple of vehicles sauntering through the jungle at 50 mph is no more ridiculous that a guy, having been shot in the arm and thrown through the windshield of a truck, dragging himself underneath it at 50 mph...folks, this is all Stupid Stuff, but it's also Fun Stuff.  Don't take it too seriously, and be grateful that Harrison Ford actually had the grit to do another one!
B001NFNFIK|1.0|(1.) An editors paradise where the director filmed a lot of scenes and then handed the entire mess to a studio editor and said, \\"Assemble something out of this mishmash that makes a little sense and lasts 90 minutes.\\" e.g. countless scenes where one event is happening like a monotonous distant shot of Jones in a car on a dirt road which then suddenly jumps to Jones talking to someone on a porch. Half the movie consists of these disruptively annoying Star Trek transporter events.  (2.) Very cheaply produced -  a couple of cars, a couple of houses (including stock footage of houses after hurricane Katrina) and a tavern with endless scenes of the actors transporting around between them.  (3.) Nothing in this movie is deeply developed including characters and crime scenes. We know little or nothing about who each person really is. We never see a crime (too expensive to do well to be filmed) only a vague after-the-fact result such as a barrel filled with crabs which is suppose to also contain a body.   (4.) Acting -  please! Another example of actors as they get old, lazy and fat not willing to do the work needed to produce memorable results. Just another quick paycheck. The entire script was composed of stock, my turn - your turn, one line monologues.   (5.) Poor accuracy and research e.g. a Louisiana swamp doesn't contain \\"sandbars\\" as was mentioned many times in the movie. There may be sand but it's covered by many feet of organic detritus and plants.
B001SGEUNI|5.0|HALESTORM's debut, self-titled album is one of the best releases of the year. Lzzy's voice will HAUNT you -- it's that good.  There's no note she can't hit -- no soul she can't rock to its core.  Halestorm is destined to be a huge success ... I suggest you get on board now.
B00127RAJY|5.0|First off, I am one of Jillian's biggest fans. I love her tough love workouts and her way of motivating the viewer. This D.V.D doesn't have any frilly, lacy components to it so don't expect a dance routine or some sort of number to follow. This is strictly a Strength, Cardio, and Ab workout. She has a system that she uses known as \\"Circuits\\". This consists of 3 circuits of 3 minutes of strength, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of abs. She also has a warm-up and cool-down.     She incorporates arms, legs, and abs when doing strength. So if you are doing squats, be prepared to do bicep curls along with it. There is no rest allowed in this D.V.D which is exactly what will give you the fastest results.     I have owned this D.V.D for months now and when I incorporate it with my 30 minute run everyday, I have been in the best shape of my life. Also, make sure you try out Jillian's other videos! If the weather is bad, I substitute the Banish Fat, Boost Metabolism video for running.
B001PPGAIA|2.0|I enjoyed the movie but some of the middle scenes jumped back and forth which at times spoilt our viewing enjoyment.There was obviously a defect in the disc. This is the first time we have had a problem with a purchase from Amazon.
B00006WKY9|5.0|The Scorpions with Uli Roth were a groundbreaking band, with a great combination of good songwriting, great musicianship, and excellent vocals. This album is the swan song of this incarnation of the Scorpions, and although I like their Mercury line-up to the present, I believe this particular combination was the best. \\"Sails of Charon\\" and \\"We'll burn the Sky\\" are the highlights of this disc, as far as I'm concerned. Sadly as a symptom of the personality conflicts that led to Uli's departure from the band, he refused to play a solo on \\"Steamrock Fever\\". Frankly I like the song and think the odd chord progressions before the chorus would make for a good solo backdrop for Uli's lead. But alas it didn't happen. It makes little difference as the album as a whole is still 1st rate and one of my favorite Scorpions releases.
0670020745|4.0|In My Stroke of Insight author Jill Bolte Taylor shares her experiences of surviving and recovering from a stroke.  A brain scientist, she explains what she experienced in graphic detail, while explaining the science in understandable laymen's terms.  This is a fascinating look at the machinations of the brain, and the potential it holds.    At a short 177 pages, the book retains the interest of the reader, and is easy to read. Yet it would have been well served to have been more closely edited.   Part reads like a self-help book, as the author deals with a more spiritual aspect of her recovery, and this portion has repetitions.  But the tips for working with and caring for a brain-injured person are invaluable.  This is a must read for caregivers and providers.
B001DSNELA|5.0|I like this James Bond.  This DVD held my interest all the way through.
B001IBIQU6|4.0|I've been a DM fan since 1985, although some of their '80s output turned me off (in particular, about half of \\"Black Celebration\\" I could simply do without). However, since Violator, I've had very little to complain about. The pretentiousness I detected in their pre-Violator work has been, if not gone, at least under control, with an expanded palette of instruments and, er, *modes* of expressing themselves through music. On \\"Sounds of the Universe\\" they coninue to deliver.     I agree with BKB928 that it takes a few listens to get into it, although the beautiful \\"Peace\\" caught my ear on the first listen. Basically, this album did nothing to sway me from my view that DM is an \\"Eighties band\\" that has only improved since the '80s ended.
B001TH16DI|2.0|I'm fine with the fact that these are theatrical cuts.  in fact, with the exception of ST 1, i think the theatrical cuts are better.  (but they should have included both cuts wiht seamless branching)    but what really gets me is the quality of the video on this.  it really looks bad.  go to [...] and see the screen captures for yourself. it's certainly an improvement over the dvd, but it's still really bad for blu ray.    i'll wait for the inevitable re-release...hopefully the jump in quality will be comparable to the jump from the original dvds to the 2-disc special editions.
B001SN78JO|5.0|I just saw the DVD of this movie last night, and I've been a BIG Jim Carrey fan since his first movie:Ace Ventura.      I really enjoyed this movie and found a lot of what was going on to be very plausable. Now I've read a lot of reveiws about the sexual content and after watching it (which I found to be very funny) I found that they left most of it to the viewers imagination.     The launguage wasn't overdone, but it did fit into the certain dialogue, and the over all film was fairly well done.     Now I was reading one reviewers comments that said that the film was predictable. I'll agree with you on that point, but just seeing the outcome is often quite worth the wait.     I laughed right through the entire movie!
B001TH16DS|5.0|I couldn't believe I was buying yet another version of ST:TOS but after watching a couple of episodes I'm glad I did! These discs really take advantage of the BD format, with seamless branching (I love switching between the original effects and the new \\"enhanced\\" effects on the fly!), excellent picture and a dynamite 7.1 DTS HD audio remix. I'm also glad the new BD discs show the enhanced CGI effects in the 4:3 aspect ratio instead of the 16:9 wide-screen aspect the HD-DVDs used; in 4:3 the effects don't seem as jarring as on the HD-DVD presentations and really do \\"enhance\\" the experience. The BD version also takes advantage of PIP video capabilities to display video commentary tracks on 5 episodes, and uses pop-up graphics for the trivia tracks instead of \\"subtitle\\" text. I really thought these would be a straight port of the HD-DVD version but CBS/Paramount has done much better than that. I'm looking forward to checking out the new HD special features and now can't wait for Seasons 2 & 3! I hope the feature films come out as good as TOS: Season 1. Highly recommended.
B001UE276A|5.0|I have been a Depeche Mode fan for seventeen years and have followed the band closely ever since.  I have seen them three times and plan to see them two more on this coming tour. The amount of CDs, videos, DVDs, books, t-shirts and frames posters I have that are Depeche Mode related borderlines on ridiculous.  In my very humble opinion this band can really do no wrong (other than the song call \\"Wrong').  I like to believe that this devotion is based more on the quality of music that band has produced over the years and not just because anything Depeche Mode does is wonderful.<br /><br />I know that many people state that Depeche Mode isn't the same band since Alan Wilder left and this assumption is correct.  [Hell, Depeche Mode hasn't been the same band since Vince Clark left.]  I was REALLY upset when Alan Wilder left the band in 1995.  However, in hindsight it wasn't really a big surprise.  There was some tension (I believe) after the recording of SOFAD and the Devotional Tour.  Nevertheless Wilder is an amazing musician and he really brought a lot Depeche Mode.<br /><br />One idea I would like to present is this, perhaps Depeche Mode became stronger once Alan Wilder left?  The three remaining members really needed to hold it down if they had any plans of going forward.  David Gahan kicked his addictions to drugs/alcohol and has released (so far) two solid solo albums.  This has lead to Gahan now sharing song writing duties with Martin Gore.  Martin Gore and Andy Fletcher also have some accomplishments since Wilder left the band.  The former has released a second solo album and has written some great tunes for DM and Fletch has/had started his own label Toast Hawaii.<br /><br />\\"Sounds of the Universe\\" finds Depeche Mode in familiar territory, with some drops of out of character approaches thrown in for good measure. \\"In Sympathy\\" sounds like a classic DM from the 1990's and \\"Corrupt\\" sounds like a missing song from \\"Violator\\". \\"Wrong\\" isn't like anything they have done before, where \\"Peace\\" and \\"Perfect\\" are more uplifting tunes that haven't been heard by this band in a long time, if ever. The vintage synthesizers and keyboards are force to be reckoned with on this album.  The instrumental on this album, \\"Spacewalker\\" sounds a lot the score from the 1971 film \\"[[ASIN:B001B1Q3LM Daughters of Darkness]]\\". There are also certain songs that sound like they are trapped in an Atari 2600 game, which to me is cool.<br /><br />Comparisons have been made between SOTU and 2001's \\"[[ASIN:B00005BL2A Exciter]]\\".  The only comparison I see is that both albums are mellow.  However, I feel that \\"Exciter\\" was much more ambient and mellow than SOTU.  Subsequently, \\"In Chains\\" would have not been out of place on \\"Exciter\\".  The songs on SOTU really range in tempo, style and meaning.  The first track being \\"In Chains\\", more or less a love song and the final track being \\"Corrupt\\" which is drenched in sordidness, sexy and masochism.<br /><br />The one thing I noticed about this album is I needed to listen to it a few times for my appreciation to develop. This is a much layered album that might take more than one listen to truly enjoy.  \\"Come Back\\" and \\"Jezebel\\" both didn't sound that great at first, now I totally love them.  Therefore, it might be possible for multiple listens before \\"you feel a little love\\".<br /><br />The deluxe box set of SOTU is a Depeche Mode's fan dream come true. When I was first going through the contents in this box set I felt like it was Christmas morning.  Within the box a fan will find three CDS.  The first is the standard album.  The second is five unreleased songs/B-sides and remixes from the album.  The third is a collection of demos that range back to the days of \\"[[ASIN:B000ENV2QO Music for the Masses]]\\".  I found that the sound quality on these demos were amazing.<br /><br />There is also a DVD that has four studio performances, the video for \\"Wrong\\", the entire album on 5.1 surround sound, as well as the unreleased songs/B-sides, three documentaries following the making of the album.  A poster, post cards, buttons; two hard cover books (one with lyrics/photos, the other with photos of studio production) and a certificate of authenticity.  A lot of work went into the production of this box set and a statement has been made.  Depeche Mode really loves their fans.  However besides hard core DM fans, I don't see the causal Depeche listener getting their grubby little paws on this.<br /><br />As for the unreleased songs/B-sides, they are mind blowing! \\"Ghost\\" is such a throwback to the old Mode days, yet retains a fresh vibe.  The lyrics are literally haunting.  \\"Oh Well\\", is the first song written by Gore and Gahan and it is marvelous.  As a matter of fact, Depeche Mode could have used all five of these unreleased songs/B-sides plus maybe two more songs and could have easily made SOTU a double album.<br /><br />With regards to the response to SOTU, it has been mixed. There has been some praise of this album and some criticism as well.  This is common for any type of media. Nevertheless, I would like to take a moment to address the criticism towards SOTU.  Under the assumption a person just dislikes this album and hates the way it sounds, that is cool, we are all have different tastes and it is hard to please everyone.  In contrast, to report that this album sucks because it doesn't sound like \\"[[ASIN:B000002LK1 Violator]]\\" or \\"[[ASIN:B000HIVQBC Songs of Faith and Devotion]]\\" (or any of their works) is really asinine.  To set oneself up to thinking that every new Depeche Mode album is going to sound like one of their former albums is going to produce only one result........disappointment!!<br /><br />For instance, REM is never going to make another \\"[[ASIN:B000002LOE Out of Time]]\\", Pearl Jam is never going to make another \\"[[ASIN:B0000027RL Ten]]\\", Metallica is never going to make another \\"[[ASIN:B000025ZVE Master of Puppets]]\\", U2 is never going to make another \\"[[ASIN:B000WS4PCO Joshua Tree]]\\", and The Cure is never going to make another \\"[[ASIN:B000002H70 Disintegration]]\\" and Depeche Mode is never going to make another \\"Violator\\". Everyone one of the following bands has evolved over time and is still around. I believe they do this by staying fresh and doing different things, if a band doesn't shake things up then they become predictable and boring.<br /><br />Depeche Mode didn't get where they were today by repeating themselves.  They keep it fresh and try new things; perhaps some albums are stronger than others but the approach is the same.  I am just glad they are still around; there was a point in time where I wasn't sure.  Besides think of any band, author, actor or movie director (or whatever) that has been around for almost 30 years.  There is going to be some deviation from the mean, just to keep it new and exciting.  It is hard to pigeon-hole Depeche Mode because they have touched so many different genres perhaps their strength is also their weakness.<br /><br />As for criticism about the production of this album being bad I don't know what to say.  I can say that I like the way this album sounds and I enjoy the songs.  For agreement's sake if I wanted production to be better I wouldn't know where to start.  Since I have never produced an album before, yet the criticism states to bring Alan Wilder back.  Would Alan even come if requested?  In addition, what type of \\"Depeche Mode Fans\\" is sitting around waiting to listen for \\"The Next Violator\\"?  \\"Violator\\" is almost 20 years old and Alan Wilder has been away from the band for fourteen years.  Depeche Mode has released four albums since Wilder's departure; it appears this longing for a copycat album is a moot exercise.  I can think of many other elements in contemporary times to grip about than wishing that Depeche Mode would/will rerecord \\"Violator\\".<br /><br />The one thing I do know about SOTU is I believe it is a solid and great album from a band I love.

B0012GN0Z8|5.0|I love Bruce Springsteen. My younger sister introduced me to his music when she was a teenager. I had first heard from others, that his music was boring, trite and over done. I was listening to Mott the Hoople, Quicksilver and Humble Pie and I had it all going on. My friends did not care for Springsteen and still most of them do not.<br /><br />I saw him in concert in 1984 in Worcester, Ma and I cried almost all night..It was soooooooooooo wonderful. My sister and I, were hoarse for 3 days afterwards. Every song, he played for us. Every move, he made on stage..was for us.<br /><br />I have not seen him perform recently, but would if the chance came about.<br /><br />I love this album, I love all his albums. I love him with and without his band and with and without Patti.<br /><br />He is a great artist and a great musician. I want to thank Mr. Springsteen for being there when I needed him and my sister for making the whole thing possible, in the first place.
B001N26GFC|5.0|This is one of those films in which the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.  Until near the end of the film, virtually nothing of consequence has happened.  The entire affair is a slice of life movie, focused entirely on small, typical moments in an irrepressibly chipper and upbeat 30-year-old Londoner named Poppy.  We get glimpses of her social life, her professional life, her romantic life, her recreational life, and her attempt to learn to drive.<br /><br />The film is buoyed by Mike Leigh's usual light yet deft touch, always managing to get out of the ways to allow his actors to do what they do best.  And as usual, his actors are better in his films than they are in just about anything that they do.  Leigh consistently creates some of the best opportunities for actresses than any other director active today.  I know of absolutely no director who has gotten more superb performances out of actresses over the past 15 years than Leigh.  We've seen not one, not two, but three absolutely stellar performances in three of his films in which actresses turned in what were consensus international choices as the best performances that year by actresses.  The one and only awards organization to consistently ignore these performances have been the Oscars.  In 1996 Brenda Blethyn won every single Best Actress award in the world for SECRETS AND LIES (well over 20 awards in all), all except the Oscar (which Frances McDormand won for her excellent but vastly less impressive performance in FARGO).  Then in 2004 Imelda Staunton was almost universally acclaimed the Best Actress for the title role of VERA DRAKE, but Hillary Swank (like Frances McDormand, in one of her few wins over Staunton) won the Oscar for MILLION DOLLAR BABY.  Now in 2008 Sally Hawkins won a shelf full of awards for her extraordinary performance as Poppy (including the Golden Globe and the NY Film Critics Circle Award, in addition to many others).  So how did she do at the Oscars?  Would you believe that she wasn't even nominated?  I've become increasingly dismissive of the Oscars over the years, primarily because they rarely recognize true excellence and give awards based on familiarity and popularity (McDormand over Blethyn, Swank over Staunton).  So of course the Oscars failed to even nominate what was perhaps the finest performance by any actress in 2008.<br /><br />The wonderful thing about this movie is how we get to know and like Poppy.  The film has little or no plot so what drive it has comes from our silent witnessing of how she lives her life, always upbeat, joking, and kidding.  We see her in her trampoline class.  We see her taking flamenco lessons. We see her giddily get an adjustment from a chiropractor.  And, most of all, we see her taking driving lessons with a fascinating but mentally and emotionally unstable driving instructor (brilliantly portrayed by Eddie Marsan) who becomes oddly attracted to her.  We get to see Poppy from a number of perspectives and as we see her happily and compassionately making her way through life, we come to love her and pull for her.  I think ultimately whether you love, like, or hate this movie will inevitably depend on your reaction to Poppy.  Sally Hawkins endows her with such passion and pluck that I loved her despite finding her jocularity sometimes a tad grating.  And while by no means a beauty, Hawkins through the force of her personality makes Poppy surprisingly attractive.<br /><br />I was not terribly familiar with Sally Hawkins prior to this film.  I remember her from VERA DRAKE, but nothing else.  I do plan on seeing the most recent adaptation of Jane Austen's PERSUASION, in which she had the lead role.  Hopefully she'll be in a long string of movies that I can enjoy her in in the future.'t even nominated?

B000V659OU|5.0|I received the DVD in good time and in excellent condition. The film is an entertaining version of a father /son conflict story. I used it in a literature class along with Death of a Salesman, Fences. Big Fish is definitely a light-hearted treatment of similar issues with lots of exciting visual effects.
B001IBIQU6|5.0|I have been a Depeche Mode fan for seventeen years and have followed the band closely ever since.  I have seen them three times and plan to see them two more on this coming tour. The amount of CDs, videos, DVDs, books, t-shirts and frames posters I have that are Depeche Mode related borderlines on ridiculous.  In my very humble opinion this band can really do no wrong (other than the song call \\"Wrong').  I like to believe that this devotion is based more on the quality of music that band has produced over the years and not just because anything Depeche Mode does is wonderful.<br /><br />I know that many people state that Depeche Mode isn't the same band since Alan Wilder left and this assumption is correct.  [Hell, Depeche Mode hasn't been the same band since Vince Clark left.]  I was REALLY upset when Alan Wilder left the band in 1995.  However, in hindsight it wasn't really a big surprise.  There was some tension (I believe) after the recording of SOFAD and the Devotional Tour.  Nevertheless Wilder is an amazing musician and he really brought a lot Depeche Mode.<br /><br />One idea I would like to present is this, perhaps Depeche Mode became stronger once Alan Wilder left?  The three remaining members really needed to hold it down if they had any plans of going forward.  David Gahan kicked his addictions to drugs/alcohol and has released (so far) two solid solo albums.  This has lead to Gahan now sharing song writing duties with Martin Gore.  Martin Gore and Andy Fletcher also have some accomplishments since Wilder left the band.  The former has released a second solo album and has written some great tunes for DM and Fletch has/had started his own label Toast Hawaii.<br /><br />\\"Sounds of the Universe\\" finds Depeche Mode in familiar territory, with some drops of out of character approaches thrown in for good measure. \\"In Sympathy\\" sounds like a classic DM from the 1990's and \\"Corrupt\\" sounds like a missing song from \\"Violator\\". \\"Wrong\\" isn't like anything they have done before, where \\"Peace\\" and \\"Perfect\\" are more uplifting tunes that haven't been heard by this band in a long time, if ever. The vintage synthesizers and keyboards are force to be reckoned with on this album.  The instrumental on this album, \\"Spacewalker\\" sounds a lot the score from the 1971 film \\"[[ASIN:B001B1Q3LM Daughters of Darkness]]\\". There are also certain songs that sound like they are trapped in an Atari 2600 game, which to me is cool.<br /><br />Comparisons have been made between SOTU and 2001's \\"[[ASIN:B00005BL2A Exciter]]\\".  The only comparison I see is that both albums are mellow.  However, I feel that \\"Exciter\\" was much more ambient and mellow than SOTU.

B001QOOCTE|5.0|I first heard of the project from a friend who sent me the Youtube link to the \\"Stand by Me\\" video.  After playing the video repeatedly for two weeks, I saw that the CD and DVD had been released.  The idea of spreading peace and love through the universal language of music is genius.  The song lyrics are insightful, the voices full of emotion, and the arrangements lush.  This is a musical experience not to be missed.  Feel the love and pass the peace.
B0027HOBM2|5.0|Frankly, I'm pretty despondent about the future of quality TV on the major four networks. The recent cancellation by ABC of the breathtakingly brilliant PUSHING DAISIES was the first major blow. When a show this great can get cancelled for weak (not genuinely bad, merely weak) ratings, you feel that something has gone wrong with commercial television. For one thing, TV history is resplendent with shows that started off weakly and then succeeded a couple of years into their run. THE X-FILES, SEINFELD, THE OFFICE, and 30 ROCK all started off with weak ratings, only to build an audience later. The second horrific piece of news undermining my confidence in commercial TV was NBC's announcement that starting next year Jay Leno will get FIVE HOURS (!) of prime time for a more politically oriented version of his talk show. First, why would we want Leno when we already have Stewart and Colbert? Second, this means losing FIVE HOURS (!!!!) of scripted programming on NBC each week. This is a recipe for disaster. And an act of despair. NBC clearly doesn't think it can produce 15 hours of quality TV a week, so it is trying to produce only 10 and then take the super cheap option with Leno. NBC, I have news for you: you get what you pay for.<br /><br />MAD MEN could well be the model for successful quality TV shows in the future. Although it gets very low ratings, on AMC it is safe from cancellation because of its widespread critical acclaim. More and more, niche cable networks seem to be the place where quality TV series manage to thrive and avoid the constant threat of cancellation. AMC in fact has two superb series, MAD MEN and the very promising BREAKING BAD (which was seriously truncated by the writers' strike last year) and they've announced a new Sci-fi series based upon Kim Stanley Robinson's acclaimed Mars trilogy, about the settling of colonies on Mars. The series is taking its title from the first of Robinson's novels, RED MARS.<br /><br />So, while I'm on the verge of giving up on ABC, NBC, and FOX (though under new head of programming Kevin Reilly its shows have become more interesting and he has so far resisted to kill shows prematurely as his predecessors did). CBS I gave up on years ago, since the network seems content to churn out an endless number of bland police procedurals. AMC, F/X, Showtime, HBO, ABC Family, the Sci Fi Channel, and similar networks may be where we all go in the future for the best shows.<br /><br />MAD MEN became the first show not on one of the big four networks or HBO to win the Emmy for Best Drama this past summer. It will almost certainly win again this coming summer, since Season Two was even better than Season One. Moreover, during Season Two the show started building a buzz, culminating with a great appearance by Jon Hamm on SNL, including a skit with some of his MAD MEN guest stars. The show became part of our cultural sensibility, inspiring magazine photo spreads. I still think the show is one that people tend to know about rather than know. Thankfully people who do not have access to AMC can catch up on DVD (I watch it as it comes out, but my cable company shows AMC in low-def rather than high-def, so much of the show's physical beauty can only be recaptured on DVD or Blu-ray).<br /><br />As good as the show was in Season Two, the sophomore season was even more brilliant. In my review of Season One, I mentioned that Jon Hamm's character Don Draper exemplifies Thoreau's statement that most people live \\"lives of quiet desperation.\\" In Season Two, Hamm and his carefully constructed existence gradually begins coming apart at the seams. His Stepford Wife Betty begins to come apart at more than the seams. I really enjoyed January Jones in Season One, but primarily she was a beautiful manikin. In Season Two the human being inside is psychically rebelling against the roles she is being forced to play and the result is someone who is on the verge of collapse. One scene in particular was compelling. As she prepares for a dinner party she notices that one of the dining room chairs is wobbly. Moving the chair back and forth gives way to anger, as she displaces the stress of her life onto the chair and she begins to destroy and obliterate it. Indeed, the many moments where Betty loses control are among the season's finest.<br /><br />January Jones's amazing performance as Betty gets a bit less acclaim than she deserves in part because of Elizabeth Moss's job as Peggy Olson. I think many people watching MAD MEN began in Season Two to realize that Peggy, as much as Don Draper, was central to the meaning of the show. I have very little evidence for this, but I believe that the show will end with Peggy Olson heading Sterling Cooper. The show started with her first day as an employee of the company, working as Don Draper's secretary. We've seen her become a successful copywriter for the company and at the end of Season Two even has the office next to Don's. I believe that a logical ending of the series, mapping al the changes that took place in national sensibilities in the sixties, would be for Peggy to become head of the company that at the start of the year was so completely male dominated. This does not mean, however, that Peggy's personal life has kept pace with her professional life. In fact, Peggy remains a bit of a mess. The season did end, however, with perhaps the best scene in the entire run of the show so far. Peter tells Peggy that he hates his marriage and that he loves her. Shockingly, Peggy tells him that she had had his baby and given it away. My feeling was that in telling Peter she was not trying to be cruel so much as she was trying to definitively close the door on one part of her life and open another. Peggy is one of the most wonderfully complex characters on TV. While Don Draper has artfully created a public self, Peggy has not. She has primarily resisted the roles that people have tried to provide for her. She has not yet become her own person, but you feel that she might. I also find her and Don Draper's relationship to be delightful. They are not close friends or perhaps not even friends. But a flashback in which Don visits her in the hospital when she is suffering from post-partum depression (intensified by the fact that she didn't even know she was pregnant) and essentially orders her to get her act together and get out of the hospital. Don is not always presented as a good person, but he has his moments, and the tough love he gives Peggy at the moment helps her turn her life around.<br /><br />I mention Don, Betty, and Peggy, but one of the delights of MAD MEN is the very deep cast of characters. Joan Holloway (played by the beautiful Christina Hendricks) has a new fianc&eacute;, but it doesn't appear to be the healthiest of relationships (one of the most shocking moments in Season Two occurs when he rapes her in Sterling Cooper offices). The deeply closeted Salvatore starts gradually to confront his own sexuality and his attraction to men, including a coworker, while his \\"beard\\" marriage struggles. Roger Sterling struggles to overcome health problems in order to marry a much, much younger woman.<br /><br />But at the heart of the show Don Draper remains the dominant character. Jon Hamm's performance as Don has been brilliant from the very beginning. On \\"Fresh Air with Terry Gross\\" series creator Matthew Weiner explained that Hamm instantly stood out in auditions, but the network wanted an established actor in the role. They were adamant that they did not want an unknown actor in the show's central role. Weiner finally issued an ultimatum, that without Jon Hamm as Don Draper, he was unwilling to proceed with the series. Weiner's wisdom in casting Hamm has been proven many times over. It is almost impossible to imagine this show without him. Don is one of the most artificial and complex characters in the history of TV. Just as he creates ad campaigns, so he has created the persona Don Draper. Season Two shows Draper having serious doubts about whether he wants to persist in playing the character he has created for himself.<br /><br />I read a bit over a year ago that the plan for the show was to move a couple of years into the future with each ensuing season. If so, Season Three should pick up sometime past the Kennedy assassination, perhaps with the early part of the Vietnam War. Clearly the show intends to reflect the enormous social upheaval that took place in the decade. It also represents many of the now almost comic aspects of the pre-sixties world. For instance, in one scene Don, Betty, and their kids are enjoying a picnic on a blanket in a lovely country locale. As they finish, Don stands up and shakes all of their trash off the blanket and onto the ground. This was very definitely before Lady Bird Johnson's attempt to beautify America by picking up trash. I'm sure that Season Three will show many new changes.<br /><br />This is easily one of the 3 or 4 best shows on TV. I put it up there with my own favorites PUSHING DAISIES, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, BATTLESTAR GALACTICA, and LOST. Notice that of those shows PUSHING DAISIES was on ABC and has been cancelled, FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS was on DirecTV in the fall and will be on NBC in the winter and spring, and LOST begins its penultimate season on ABC. I think in the future fewer and fewer of my favorite shows will be originating on the big four. AMC, with MAD MEN leading the way, is one of the last, best hopes for television.nd her and Don Draper's relationship to be delightful. They are not close friends or perhaps not even friends. But a flashback in which Don visits her in the hospital when she is suffering from post-partum depression (intensified by the fact that she didn't even know she was pregnant) and essentially orders her to get her act together and get out of the hospital. Don is not always presented as a good person, but he has his moments, and the tough love he gives Peggy at the moment helps her turn her life around.     I mention Don, Betty, and Peggy, but one of the delights of MAD MEN is the very deep cast of characters. Joan Holloway (played by the beautiful Christina Hendricks) has a new fiancé, but it doesn't appear to be the healthiest of relationships (one of the most shocking moments in Season Two occurs when he rapes her in Sterling Cooper offices). The deeply closeted Salvatore starts gradually to confront his own sexuality and his attraction to men, including a coworker, while his \\"beard\\" marriage struggles. Roger Sterling struggles to overcome health problems in order to marry a much, much younger woman.     But at the heart of the show Don Draper remains the dominant character. Jon Hamm's performance as Don has been brilliant from the very beginning. On \\"Fresh Air with Terry Gross\\" series creator Matthew Weiner explained that Hamm instantly stood out in auditions, but the network wanted an established actor in the role. They were adamant that they did not want an unknown actor in the show's central role. Weiner finally issued an ultimatum, that without Jon Hamm as Don Draper, he was unwilling to proceed with the series. Weiner's wisdom in casting Hamm has been proven many times over. It is almost impossible to imagine this show without him. Don is one of the most artificial and complex characters in the history of TV. Just as he creates ad campaigns, so he has created the persona Don Draper. Season Two shows Draper having serious doubts about whether he wants to persist in playing the character he has created for himself.

B00005R8GU|4.0|Muddy with members of the Butterfield Blues Band/ Electric Flag as a backing band...this is an outstanding concept...and the music is excellent, but not quite as earthshaking as I had imagined. I was hoping that  Bloomfield would be loose and inspired in the presence of Muddy, but such is not the case...I do love this record, but Bloomfield just sounds more tame here than usual, and often not really like Bloomfield, and I love Bloomfield's playing...conversely, Butterfield is as cool as ever...while I understand that the band was justifiably deferential to great King Muddy, the music may have benefitted from more input from the various talented players present at the sessions.     Muddy is great form here, and the atmosphere is genuinely cool and spooky...but unlike, say, \\"Fleetwood Mac in Chicago\\", where Peter Green and co. share the spotlight with Chicago blues legends, on \\"Fathers and Sons\\" it feels like this is ALL about Muddy...again its not that these performances are lackluster, they actually are great, but they feel pretty safe, because they never stray very far from Muddy's original recordings...Although my own presuppositions about the potential of these sessions makes me a slightly hesitant in my review, I still recommend this fine recording, for it is a treasure from an era when American music was still great art and was truly culturally significant.
B000A78Z82|5.0|While \\"Smokey Rolls down Thunder Canyon\\" may be his 'best' album sonically, \\"Cripple Crow\\" is easily his most extended, experimental record by a mile. You certainly have to be cut from a different cloth to enjoy such music (most people I've played it to have termed it 'monotonous', 'slow' and 'long'). To be fair, they do have a point. Banhart isn't exactly the master of brevity. Like Tori Amos, he believes in giving his audience every minute that can be put onto CD, which is why many of his albums clock in at nearly 80 minutes a piece.<br /><br />That said, \\"Cripple Crow\\" is even longer. This version is the Standard US Edition that is generally available. However, do try getting your hands on the 2-Disc Japanese Edition that has a second disc of gorgeous songs that never made the final cut (many of them being as essential as this core album). \\"Cripple Crow\\" also has fascinating cover-art, reminiscent of that momentous Beatles CD (only none of the faces, save for Banhart, are recognizable at all).<br /><br />Like all Banhart records, there is no cohesive 'theme' at work, nor is this a 'concept record'. Many of the songs seem to be about love, death, and relationships, but almost all of them deal with loneliness and an inability to communicate effectively. All of this seems to be addressed in purely esoteric terms, with large emphasis on melody, melancholy and a rambling set of tunes, that once heard, cannot be easily forgotten (in that sense, I would compare it to Joanna Newsoms' masterpiece \\"Ys\\")<br /><br />As always, Devendra's quaint Spanish accent works well on those tracks, and this is especially evident on the absolutely luminous \\"Quedate Luna\\" (according to this writer, its also the single most affecting track on the entire disc). Some of the Spanish tracks, such as \\"The Beatles\\" seem to have a sense of humor (and fantastic rhymes and vocal rolls).<br /><br />Musically, this is certainly the 'easiest' album to love by Devendra, as it has some soaring choruses and singalong bits, most visible on \\"Hey Mama Wolf\\", a ponderous, beautiful melody offset by Banharts' almost Buckleyesque vocals. The shortest song, \\"Dragonflies\\" is a spellbinding duet that lasts less than a minute, but the lyrics are terrific. The same can be said of \\"Little Boys\\", a controversial (upon release) track that tells us the tale of a hermaphrodite and what he 'wants from life' through his eyes.<br /><br />I had a friend once that said that only Devendra's music seemed to 'speak to his soul'. That is true for many people, and certainly true for this writer as well. Joanna Newsom comes close, but she seems to be soaring in the sky rather than reach down to interact with the more earthy elements. \\"Inaniel\\" once saw a friend of mine through a grueling ten hour drive to a hospital cross-state where he was sure to be greeted with bad news. He put it on repeat, and though it couldn't obviously change the outcome, it made him peaceful. Not much music you could say that about.<br /><br />Devendra Banhart is a spiritual performer, but also one that is in touch with a number of things in life that deserve more attention - like humor. His \\"Chinese Children\\" seems silly at first, but when you regard the sequencing in the album, it falls into place. Like \\"Smokey Rolls Down Thunder Canyon\\", this is one album that is filled with one sonic masterpiece after another, and its virtually impossible to choose one track over the other. For what its worth, this is pure audio gold, and if you are at all interested in the freak folk scene (though that tag is unwarranted), this is the album for you.<br /><br />For lovers of Banhart, the closest thing would be Vetiver (an obscure band that deserves far more recognition). Also check out the following albums to build a sophisticated folk-album collection in general. I dislike using the word 'folk', but these albums will best suit you, should you decide this is the kind of music you appreciate:<br /><br />1. Joanna Newsom : \\"Ys\\" (No doubt about it, this is a must-own. This is the greatest album ever recorded, in my opinion, and everyone needs to own a copy)<br />2. Vashti Bunyan : \\"Lookaftering\\" (Her second album in 35 years, and a quiet, peaceful record that is a must-buy)<br />3. Ane Brun : \\"Changing of the Seasons\\" (From Scandinavia, this underrated album deserves a wider audience as its a classic of its' genre)<br /><br />Five Stars.

B00005JN8Z|5.0|\\"Quo Vadis\\" is a superb film in every way. Dramatic theme, wonderful  acting (especially Sir Peter Ustinov as Nero), glorious sets, epic scenes,  quotable screenplay, and outstanding music by Miklos Rozsa. I loved this   movie when I first saw it in l951, and this DVD format even enhances this classis film. It's a joy to be able to watch this great movie whenever the spirit moves me. It's a must addition to any film collection. All of those who were involved with bringing \\"Quo Vadis\\" to the DVD format are to be congratulated for doing an outstanding job. Viewers will also enjoy the included New Featurette. Quo vadis? To watch this extremely entertaining  motion picure. Prof. Dr. H. James Birx, birxh@canisius.edu
1575666286|5.0|This is a very complete explanation of the diet, the history of the Dr.Gerson, recipes, etc.  It is an excellent book and I received it in short order.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|This is a much better movie not knowing anything going in.  I won't spoil anything directly but some observations might guide you along enough to assist more than you may want in revealing this film's shocking and impressive series of twists.  There is your spoiler warning.<br /><br />The title of Martyrs was perplexing to me until the film wisely justified its use in its final moments.  Early usage of the term meant a witness, and by that fact, combined with a strong theme of torture, the film carries its title quite well.  Martyrs even uses famous real life photographs of people's faces in a state of bliss after suffering greatly.  One that I noted was a slow slicing execution; one of the few photographed and the last actually performed in imperial China.  The execution was of a man who assassinated a Mongolian prince.  The film mistakenly, or perhaps wittingly but carelessly, indicates it was a woman who stole a hen.  I recall that those photos fascinated one man and even drove him mad.  I remember staring at them myself and feeling an odd mix of terror and interest.  I mention this because a little more than halfway through this very effective, scary, and suspenseful horror film, I suddenly became more seriously interested in its subject matter than any horror film I've ever seen.  I'm curious; what happens when we die?<br /><br />I like to think of Martyrs as having four different levels.  One that introduces us to the two primary characters; Lucie, a young girl who was kidnapped and tortured in a small room without windows, and Anna, who we only know as Lucie's roommate at some kind of institution.  Lucie is tortured by a \\"dead girl\\" who may or may not be the driving force and cause of Lucie's masochistic behavior.  Well, at that point the film's title hasn't even been introduced to the audience.  From there the film goes forward 15 years later and we get to see Lucie's rage on full display.  That's the second level and I'm not revealing the next two. Just keep in mind, that is not really what this film is about.  It just sets the stage for something far scarier and far more compelling.  And believe it or not, far more visually gruesome.<br /><br />Martyrs is actually an outstanding horror film.  I can only think two other horror films since Miike's [[ASIN:B0009WFEDC Audition]] that ran up my spine like this one did (i.e. [[ASIN:B000IHY9TS The Descent]] and [[ASIN:B00125WATQ Inside]]).  It is one of the few recent movies that actually justifies most of it's violence, and please trust me when I say this movie is extremely bloody.<br /><br />It is written and directed by Pascal Laugier ([[ASIN:B000ASATY4 Saint Ange or House of Voices]]), a visionary I am hesitant to admit I had not previously heard of.  I'm a huge fan of Clive Barker's film [[ASIN:B001QMCJ00 Hellraiser]] based on his story [[ASIN:0061452882 The Hellbound Heart]].  It is a cult classic I watch every Halloween.  I've heard that Laugier is directing a remake.  I normally cringe when my favorite films are remade and it happens all too often with horror lately, but Laugier is worthy and more than capable of handling the task.  Needless to say, I'm recommending this, but it is hardcore horror which for me makes how clever it is that much more worthy of praise.

0060567503|5.0|This is great. I bought it to listen to in my car when I am stuck in traffic. Then I passed it to my employees.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I had my doubts when I sat down for the first show. I love Nathan Fillion from his work in Firefly, Serenity, Dr. Horrible, and Outing Riley. But he's had trouble finding his niche on television. This may be it. No one can beat Fillion for comedic timing. His flexibility as an actor really gets a workout in Castle.    The biggest surprise in Castle is the excellent interaction between Molly Quinn and Fillion. What a pleasant change. A bright, intelligent relationship with positive outcomes. If you're looking for some father-daughter dialogue, you'll find it in Castle. The relationship between Castle and detective Beckett is slowing developing some depth. I want to see what happens with these people. I want to learn more about the rest of the detectives and with Castle's mother, played by Susan Sullivan. (I'm not too hot on her portrayal as a heavy drinker -- that's not funny at all.)    I think Castle is a positive, upbeat show and that most viewers will enjoy it.
B0026GBIB6|3.0|I agree that Alan Wilder was a talented musician that played a major role in developing DM's sound for most of their existence, but Depeche Mode are doing just fine without Alan.  It's very tiring that almost 15 years after he left that band, \\"fans\\" still gripe about him not being in the band.  Sounds of the Universe has debuted at #1 in dozens of countries around the world, #3 in the US.  DM has moved on without Alan, maybe it's time for some fans to do so as well.      Be skeptical of these negative reviews that talk in absolutes.  While this is far from the perfect album for me, don't listen to reviewers or \\"fans\\" who say that there is nothing good about this album.  There are some clunkers on SOTU such as Hole to Feed and Spacewalker.  But there are also some gems as well such as Wrong and Perfect.       Although the album flows well, ultimately it suffers by being too long.   With better song choice editing this could have been a much stronger album, by cutting Fragile Tension, Hole To Feed and Spacewalker and possibly adding Ghost and Oh Well, which are fantastic B-sides that can be found on their box set.  I'm just happy that after 30 years DM has released another solid album which I and many others can enjoy.
1591841992|3.0|Yes!  I did enjoy the book and have given a copy to some clients, but it just didn't add enough creativity or umphh to selling concepts or solving problems.  I think it is an airport or train station book but not a serious read.<br /><br />In some ways it is an update on Tony Buzan's mind mapping applied to business, but does not present a huge leap forward.<br />It certainly has a place and would serve a student of business to establish basic skills.  I would look for \\"The back of the napkin professional version\\" before I would include it in my professional library.<br /><br />I recently worked with an entreprenuer who was hearing impaired and worked by interpreting sign language - NOW that is seriously creative, very different and unexpectibly powerful.  Dan Roam could have pushed the creative envelope much further.
1400082773|5.0|Dreams from My Father catches a number of readers' attention in that the book is written by the first black President of America. Besides that, it was noteworthy that this book was written before he ran for president election. (There were some controversial whether he wrote this book intended to run for election, but, in my opinion, there were little political views and this story is very personal) Unlike other candidate books concealing him or herself with exaggerated words and trying to give people good fake impression, Dreams from My Father is an honest portrait of Obama, with no embellished words to exaggerate his life. This book is helpful to understand Obama's personal background and how it forms his character.   Even though it doesn't describe how he became a president of America, there are lots of aspects of his extraordinary talent and perseverance as a great leader.  I hope people, especially college students, learn his tenacity and leadership which are important social skills. From his life in Chicago, it showed how he dealt with obstacles in Altgeld Garden's housing project. Upon graduation, he worked for a year in business. He then moved to Chicago, working for a non-profit doing community organizing in the Altgeld Garden's housing project on the city of South Chicago and southern suburbs. Obama recounts the difficulty of the experience, as his program faced resistance from investment bankers, politicians, and lobbyists. Members in non profit community organization were tired of waiting with no progress and apathy from people. Finally, some members decided to give up their project. At this point, Obama persuaded and encouraged others. The reason that he didn't quit was he knew what he should do for people  in need, and what he could do; dreaming about the community, black, white, and brown with membership and uniqueness, solving problems such as corruption, poverty, and racism. By following his heart, ambition, and passion, finally his speech from sincerity moved people. He left Chicago for three years to study law at Harvard University. After graduating Harvard law school, Obama returned to Chicago empowered with knowledge of law and pursued to make many changes and he became a community activist. Everyone has his or her dream and studies in college to achieve goals. Sometimes, their plans don't go well or as they planned. Whenever facing hardship, rather abandon their plans, people should make extra efforts and equip themselves with professionalism and passions. Was he born with the title of the president of America? Was his starting point ahead comparing to others? What makes Obama such as strong and great leader? He was the one who keeps his promise with endless efforts. From his life, I hope people follow his examples.       Another part that I would like to emphasize is Obama's internationalism. Obama spent several years of his childhood living abroad -- four years in Indonesia and back to Hawaii, and other states in US. Also he maintained contact with his paternal family in Kenya. I believe Obama's internationalism brightens his leadership up. It gives him a broader outlook and enhances his foreign policy expertise. Obama has an ability to understand foreigner's point of views. Not everyone experiences those special circumstances, but at least through his life, people understand and share the feelings of Obama, a representative of minorities. I believe it enables people to learn flexible thinking and see the world in different perspectives.    Moreover, the story about his struggles to find out who he is can be a roadmap to follow for minorities in United States through his journey of dilemmas; such as being black raised in white family and how to interact with those people, black or white, how to be black when nurtured in white family and your African father nothing more than a few stories, pictures and infrequent letters.     In conclusion, I believe Dreams from My Father is a wonderful guidance and inspiration of one's life. This is an important book, and worth reading. Obama is a deep thinker and good writer because overall, his portrait is honest and truthful. As I said, even though now he is such as a great leader, what Obama described in this book was a boy who overcame challenges in his life as minority. This unusual autobiography offers brightening insight into what shaped in his life and he put his anger and alienation into determination that changed neighborhoods, and the whole world. It's instructive to know how a famous person handled the crises in his life, and pursued his dream, and moreover his life will teach you how to enrich your life. For those who wish to understand, for those in need of a blueprint in your life, here is the book, \\"Dreams from My Father\\"
0375826726|3.0|After reading this book and expecting it to end (because they called the series a trilogy!), I was pretty sad. It took like a hundred pages to describe how to make a sword which is cool and all but then there are like 50 pages on how Eragon feels about his origins and 100 more pages about him wondering why he feels this or that way...UGHHH...I sold these books back to the bookstore...I don't think they're worth having after this read...

0385340990|3.0|I had heard about this book for a while, and finally got to reading it for a book club meeting.  I had heard such rave reviews that I was expecting quite a bit - never an auspicious beginning for me and books, it seems.  This book is written as a series of letters, through which you come to meet the characters and the \\"plot\\" line that ties them together.<br /><br />I found this a quick read, and was okay with the letter format the author employed, but never found myself truly drawn into the characters or their stories.  I frequently found myself flipping back and forth to remember who each one was, and not genuinely caring much about the outcome.  I thought there was some levity and wit, and it was easy enough to get through, but I fail to see what the hype was about.<br /><br />In the end, I think this book gets more than its due because the plot has at its center a book club.  And, who better to appeal to than book fans when developing your story line, right?
B001ED7C58|5.0|I think the review title says it all! GREAT music -fans will appreciate hearing the whole song of key moments in the movie (baseball game, Edward and Bella's dinner out, Bella leaving Phoenix, etc) - non fans will enjoy hearing music from (what I'd consider) \\"non mainstream\\" groups that they may not have heard of. If it's possible to wear out a CD - I'm well on my way!
B00005KB9T|2.0|What a disappointment. This was my first Bob Marley purchase. The actual music sounds enchanting; but I can't get past the tape hiss and distortion of the base & vocals. This particular cd [EXTRA TRACKS] [ORIGINAL RECORDING REISSUED] [ORIGINAL RECORDING REMASTERED] bills itself as being \\"The definitive remasters\\". This reissue was supervised by Bill Levenson and Maxine Stowe. Bill and Maxine should be ashamed of themselves. With digital technology the tape hiss and base & vocal distortion could have been cleaned up. Bob Marely was (and is) a music legend. He deserves better.

B001IBIQU6|4.0|Much better than I expected. In my opinion, their best effort since Ultra. After several run-throughs, it's pretty good and getting better the more I listen to it.  There are some sequences and a couple of songs that perhaps should have been produced a bit differently though.  For me, the band peaked during the Violator and SOFAD period but those days are gone.  However they have continued to evolve with time and we're fortunate to still have them giving us music worth listening to.  DM is still alive- very nice.
B00004Y6O7|4.0|I say prepare to be surprised, for I am not a devout fan of Van Halen.<br /> I was never captivated by their sleazy, party-boy attitudes and the lack of progression within their music always made me want to listen to more important artists. Their material, for the most part, is pretty repetitive.<br /> So, for me, it was an unusual occurrence that I listened to more than 3or4 songs from a Van Halen album.<br />Who would have though?!<br /> It's true, however. I genuinely liked most of \\"Fair Warning\\". Only 4 out of 9 songs failed to hold my interest. That may sound like a lot, but as I previously stated, I usually can only bare to listen to 3or4 songs from any given VH record.<br /><br />Taking that into consideration, here is my list containing all of the songs I loved from \\"Fair Warning\\":<br /><br />Track1- Mean Street<br />Track2- Dirty Movies<br />Track4- Hear About it Later<br />Track5- Unchained<br />Track6- Push Comes to Shove<br /><br />The remaining tracks, 3,7,8,9 are very much like the typical VH song- Only moderately interesting in its lyrical content and quite repetitive in its musical structure.<br /><br />I've read many other reviews for this album, as well as looking it up on wikipedia. All sources confirm that \\"Fair Warning\\" was a commercial disappointment at the time of its release. This seems very odd to me. The only other Van Halen album that is as well-crafted as this would be their self-titled debut, yet Fair Warning did not garner the same amount of acclaim or success. I'm not sure why that should have been.<br /><br />In any case, if, like me, you are only an occasional fan of Van Halen, you'll really like exploring the impressive depths of this album. Or, if you're already one of Van Halen's adoring fans, your sure to have a deeper appreciation for one of your favorite band of artists.

B001S86J1C|2.0|2 stars for the classic itself, but a horrendous Blu-Ray.<br /><br />The picture quality was right up there with the worst transfer I have seen. Large volumes of grain, hair, spots on the lens, blur, etc. Every once in awhile the alternative camera provided some nice clarity (the aerial city shots and one road sequence with the red car). I panicked one time thinking a pixel had failed on my plasma, but upon inspection it was a dot on the lens. There was absolutely no effort put into the preservation here.<br /><br />The sound was standard, and typically the only clear mixture was the \\"Oh Yeah\\" end title sequence and one or two other music montages. There was no time spent on cleaning up the monotone 2.0 either.<br /><br />Extras: All the same ones (word for word) as on the special edition, nothing new.<br /><br />This has been 0/2 on new BDs this week...frustrating.

B001NESPHC|5.0|Addictive, deeply entrancing, melancholic, meandering melodies from an incredible artist... The stuff that legends are made of.
B000K7VHLY|4.0|A really great representation and interpretation of Shakespeare's tragic romance. Good for a regular movie night or to help understand the written play.
B000VFGQUC|3.0|I read the reviews on this dvd and decided to rent it before buying.Smart move cause the sound stinks.I had my 100 watt amp turned up 3/4 of the way and it just sounded like a loud tv or something.At that volume the window should have blown out!! I dont know if there was just a bad run of dvd's or what but check into it before you buy it.I used to have this on VHS HiFi back in the day and it sounded pretty good then,so go figure!! Hopefully they will correct the problem and then I will purchase it for sure cause it is an amazing concert dvd!!
B001VB8UAE|5.0|There will never be another talent like Streisand! The music, sound and amazing voice is beyond words in beauty. She has given us a gift that will last a life time. A must for those that love her music and appreciate true talent. This will remind me always of when I saw her live in NY which is one of my greatest memories. Thank you Barbra!

B001UREJWM|5.0|I think it's been over 10 years since I've liked an album this much. I was REALLY prepared to hate this album, because I wasn't impressed with the 30 second clips, and the three new songs from \\"The Dio Years\\" were the height of mediocrity - so I wasn't expecting too much from this.    I was wrong. This is the best Black Sabbath album since Born Again. It is very, very heavy. Unlike \\"Fused\\", this one is really catchy. It is very repetitive in the sense that \\"Eternal Idol\\" was, and very heavy like Born Again, though not as fast.    Get this album, it's a sure thing. I'll be listening to this one all summer long..

B000Z6RH5A|5.0|This is a beautifully crafted movie with fine acting, directing, cinematography, and an artful script. The Italian locations are beautiful and striking. In its own realm of cinema, it is a superb production.<br /> What interests me most, though, is how the film differs from Patricia Highsmith's fine novel. The film medium should not slavishly follow another art form, the novel, but should it veer so far off course as this one? We know that Highsmith was not too happy with film interpretations of her work, but we wonder how she would have reacted to this. She died in 1995; this came out in 1999.<br />Anthony Minghella, director and screenwriter, took considerable liberties with the source material. In the movie Tom commits three murders rather than the two in the novel. He is gayer in the movie while he is more closeted in the book. The character of Freddie (Philip Seymour Hoffman) is more sinister, nastier, and more important in the movie. Meredith, a key player in the movie, is non-existent, and Tom does not have a love affair with Peter Smyth Kingsley.<br />In the book Dickie paints rather than plays the saxophone. He has no local girlfriend whom he gets with child. In the book Marge has no accusation scene with Tom and is far more passive. In the movie Dickie's father cedes his son's inheritance to Tom; in the book Tom steals it by forging the son's signature. And so it goes.<br />Jude Law as Dickie Greenleaf steals the movie while a toothy and bespectacled Damon, though he does a fine job, seems more a witness than participant in the first part of movie. Tom is always trying to ingratiate himself with Dickie while Dickie often shows his complete disdain for him, calling him spooky, creepy, and a leech. Tom openly admits to his idol that he forges, lies, and does impersonations. Later, of course, he becomes Dickie for a time. Tom reads too much sexual meaning into some of Dickie's actions.<br />The movie makes Tom more guilt-ridden than the book in which he jettisons his conscience. A memorable line by Tom from the movie: \\"I'd always thought it'd be better to be a real somebody than a fake nobody.\\"ce.

0780021967|4.0|This older film by Alfred Hitchcock is certainly a treat. The plot is unpredictable with many twists and turns, many of which are unexpected.    Whereas there is suspense, the premise behind the spies always seems a bit goofy. The spies often are as far from real spies as could be possible. In this film everyone admits they are a spy within minutes of having a conversation.     But it really isn't the plasibility of the plot that matters in these older suspense films by Hitchcock. It is the combination of humor and romance that usually surrounds the leading actor and actress as they fight the villians and grow to fall in love with each other. All of this leads to some witty entertainment as unexpected consequences act as plot twists and characters have to keep up.     There is an old saying that the director must stay one step ahead of the audience and if the audience ever gets ahead of the director, the film is lost.  The nice thing about Hitchcock is despite the predicatability around the hero and heroine, who usually hate each other and then love each other, the circumstances they encounter are usually surprises that keep the viewer fully engaged.     This film in entertaining, with the scenes where the leading man and a possible romantic interest are handcuffed together and engage in one silly encounter after another as they run from the bad guys. You will like it.
0802136834|5.0|The book was delivered in excellent condition.  If you enjoy history and the show \\"The Tudors\\" you will enjoy this book.  I did not realize what happened in England in the 1500s until I read this book.  I'd recommend it to anyone who likes history.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been active for most of my life and have been a fan of Taebo for sometime now. But I felt I had plateaued with my Taebo Extreme DVD and was looking for a more challenging workout. Boy did I find it with Jillian Michaels' 30-Day Shred! And because I had plateaued with the Taebo, I found myself sweating more during Jillian Michael's 20-minute workouts than I was doing 45 minutes of Taebo.      Now, there is nothing new or creative about the moves Jillian uses but if you follow her routines to a \\"tee\\", you WILL see results. I'm telling you! She offers 3 levels and recommends strongly that you begin with level one. Follow this advice! As I mentioned, I'd been doing Taebo and I started on Level one, as instructed, and I'm glad I did. After a week, I switched to Level 2 and my body is surely feeling it. I have a sneaky feeling I'll be on Level 2 a bit longer than Level 1 but who cares. Michael's 30-Day Shred is getting it done for me. And she is so in-your-face and tells you no lies about what you need to do if you REALLY want to shed weight. She's a great motivational instructor with two great, in-shape workout partners, with one showing any modifications necessary and the other more advanced.  If you are serious about upping your cardio workouts to lose more weight, you've got to try this DVD. You can rent it from Blockbuster Online or Netflix to try it out first; but I recommend just buying it. It's totally worth it.
B0026GBIB6|3.0|When a band has been around for close to thirty years and is still making music, it probably means one of three things: 1) they're trying to recreate the past, or 2) they're trying to do something very different, or 3) they're recombining elements of their catalogue to make something kind of new and kind of familiar.  Sounds of the Universe falls into that last category.<br /><br />The latest Depeche Mode album features thirteen tracks, all of them using early-eighties synthesizers with no apologies.  At times, these tracks sound like they could have been made in 1984, using the melodic sophistication of Some Great Reward and the sonic textures of A Broken Frame.  Sounds of the Universe bleeps and thumps and hisses with a seemingly primitive array of manufactured noises in a way that only deep fans of, say, Orbital, Autechre, Kraftwerk, or early Nine Inch Nails can really appreciate.<br /><br />But to dismiss this album because of its Atari arcade sound effects would be a mistake.  For one thing, Sounds is not strictly a throwback in the sense that many of the songs use an actual guitar to great effect, which would have been unthinkable to the band in its earliest years.  &#34;Wrong,&#34; for example, owes as much to the twang of &#34;Personal Jesus&#34; as it does to the robotic drone of early Depeche Mode dirges such as &#34;Photographic.&#34;  The same applies to &#34;Fragile Tension&#34; and &#34;Come Back,&#34; and even &#34;The Truth Is/Miles Away&#34; and &#34;Perfect&#34; use guitar strategically to great effect, something that never would have happened before Music for the Masses at the earliest.<br /><br />But even the songs which rely completely on a synthetic sound don't suffer as a consequence.  &#34;Little Soul&#34; and &#34;Jezebel&#34; may not be for everyone, with their Exciter-era tempos and &#34;mature&#34; feel (which some would argue is the death knell for any band)--yet they work well for anyone who has enjoyed the quieter moments of past albums.  If you're looking for a faster track, &#34;In Sympathy&#34; is probably the best on the album, with its sunny intro and a bridge that delves into a melancholy club-thump, and &#34;In Chains&#34; continues a long tradition of kinky songs with single potential while still remaining true to the album's subtexts of justice and fairness.<br /><br />Admittedly there are some questionable decisions in the making of Sounds of the Universe, such as predictable rhymes and the campiness of Dave briefly dipping into an Elvis Presley impression as he croons &#34;The Truth Is/Miles Away.&#34;  And &#34;Peace&#34; is a little embarrassing in its sincerity.  But when in the band's career have Dave and Martin sounded so good as vocalists?<br /><br />Part of me wishes for the return of rock opera masterpieces such as &#34;Enjoy the Silence,&#34; and any legitimate DM fan will probably agree that Violator was either the band's best album or a serious contender for the title.  However, that is not going to happen, because that sound is inextricably tied to departed band member Alan Wilder and Flood, Violator's producer.  As a trio, Depeche Mode are still making very good, if not great, music--and if you can square yourself with that reality, you may find yourself listening to this &#34;grower&#34; of an album for quite some time.ster track, &#34;In Sympathy&#34; is probably the best on the album, with its sunny intro and a bridge that delves into a melancholy club-thump, and &#34;In Chains&#34; continues a long tradition of kinky songs with single potential while still remaining true to the album's subtexts of justice and fairness.

B001UDYI9K|5.0|Eric Woolfson sings The Alan Parsons Project That Never Was is a wonderful album. It is so nice to listen to an album with not only songs written by Woolfson himself but also be able to listen to his voice. He does the lead vocals on the songs. Woolfson has completed some of the unfinished works and put those together with some songs of his musicals Gambler, Gaudi, Edgar Allan Poe and Dancing Shadows (only Freudiana is missing) on this album. I enjoy the combination of strong progressive art rock songs such as Golden Key and Immortal with more pop songs such as Nothing Can Change My Mind and I Can See Round Corners. All in all a wonderful album, that asks for more from the talented Eric Woolfson, the real creator of The Alan Parsons Project.
B001N26GFM|5.0|Eight year-old Bruno, (Asa Butterfield), is an innocent, carefree boy growing up in Berlin during WWII. As the film opens, we see him running through the city's streets with his three best friends, their arms outstretched, pretending to be airplane pilots and feigning battles. Seemingly oblivious, they race past scenes of Jews being rounded up to be taken to concentration camps. Bruno, with his wonderful sense of adventure, wants to be an explorer when he grows up.<br /><br />He lives in a beautiful mansion, complete with gardens and servants, along with his twelve year-old sister Gretel, (Amber Beattie), their beautiful mother, (Vera Farmiga), and their father, a high ranking SS officer, (David Thewlis). After Bruno's and Gretel's father receives a promotion, a brand new title, \\"Commandant,\\" along with a fancier uniform, the family moves to a deserted house in the countryside. The house, a cold and somber place, with SS Stormtroopers everywhere, is actually SS Headquarters. The father's new job is to administer a concentration camp - a death camp - Auschwitz. Bruno is miserable in his new home. He misses his friends and school. There is no one to play with and he is very bored. His father tells him that, \\"Home is where the family is.\\" And, \\"Being a soldier is about duty instead of choice.\\" They cannot move back to Berlin.<br /><br />Because there is no school for the children to attend, a tutor is hired to educate them...and he does so from books filled with Nazi propaganda. When the little boy asks him about \\"nice Jews,\\" the teacher responds, \\"I think, Bruno, if you ever found a nice Jew, you would be the greatest explorer in the world.\\" Gretel soon begins to model herself after the \\"ideal\\" Nazi youth, plastering the walls of her room with photographs of Hitler and children from the Nazi Youth Group, a paramilitary organization of the Nazi Party. Bruno is not buying any of it. His tutor's teachings make no sense to him, given his budding sense of reason, and his earlier, relatively propaganda free, background. His paternal grandmother is anti-Nazi, and his mother is apolitical, but dutifully supportive of her husband.<br /><br />From his bedroom window, the boy notices a town of people dressed in striped pajamas separated from him by a wire fence. He thinks that the people are farmers. He wants to go and play with some of the children he sees, but is forbidden to leave the grounds. When he asks his father who those people are, Dad responds that they aren't really people. Bruno also asks questions about the smoke he sees rising from the \\"farm\\" and the terrible smell that accompanies it. When his mother discovers the reality of the camp, all the terrible details, she deteriorates mentally and emotionally into a shallow shell...no longer the vibrant woman we met in the opening scenes.<br /><br />With his avid curiosity and adventurous spirit, the boy finds a way out of the compound and eventually comes to the barbed wire fences surrounding the camp. He is totally bewildered by what he sees. On the other side of the fence is another eight year-old boy, Shmuel, (Jack Scanlon), a broken waif of a child wearing a numbered uniform. Shmuel lives a very different life than Bruno. He is a Jew, and along with the rest of his family, a prisoner in the camp. He sometimes hides by the fence, during work detail, where he meets Bruno and the two form a friendship. Bruno brings food for Shmuel and the two play checkers, with the board on Bruno's side of the fence. But Bruno still doesn't \\"get it.\\"  The enormity of the evil confronting him is beyond his comprehension. He believes that the numbered striped pajamas are part of a game played inside the barbed wire enclosure. He asks his friend what is burned in the chimneys.<br /><br />Their friendship is an allegory of sorts. Producer David Heyman explained in the press notes that, \\"Children have the potential and the ability to overcome differences in culture and identity; that people ultimately can get along if they're not encouraged to hate; that governments, institutions and the media can and do cultivate conflict and distrust-- these are timely ideas with universal relevance and I think this story makes them accessible to anyone.\\" At the beginning of the film, a quotation by poet John Betjeman appears on the screen, \\"Childhood is measured out by sounds and smells and sights, before the dark hour of reason grows.<br /><br />Obviously nothing good can come from this Holocaust story...how can it? The final scenes had a visceral impact on me, and I sat stunned,  in pain, for some time after the movie ended.<br /><br />\\"Striped Pajamas\\" is based on Irish author John Boyne's critically acclaimed,  award-winning young adult novel of the same title. The book is meant to educate young adults about the Holocaust. Having read the book, I think the film version is much more explicit. I believe that the manner in which the content is depicted, although done with great sensitivity and compassion, is too harsh for a young person to view. I am Jewish, and a mother, and I feel that it is so important to educate all people, especially our youth, about this most heinous event. But I prefer to do so by introducing books, like \\"The Diary of Anne Frank,\\" before exposing children and \\"tweens\\" to such a disturbing drama.<br /><br />Ultimately \\"The Boy In The Striped Pajamas\\" is about the beauty of the human spirit. The acting is exceptional, especially the performances by the three talented children, Asa Butterfield, Jack Scanlon and Amber Beattie. I do recommend this film highly. I just want the prospective viewer to be forewarned as to the strength and impact of the narrative.<br />Jana Perskieged to hate; that governments, institutions and the media can and do cultivate conflict and distrust-- these are timely ideas with universal relevance and I think this story makes them accessible to anyone.\\" At the beginning of the film, a quotation by poet John Betjeman appears on the screen, \\"Childhood is measured out by sounds and smells and sights, before the dark hour of reason grows.

B001K3JF7K|1.0|This certainly ain't no \\"Live in Paris\\". At times I was wondering if Diana was still alive. Now I'm really worried about the  tickets I purchased for her tour. If her concert consists mostly of the songs on this album the audience will be asleep by the end of the first song and I'll be walking out the door. Where is her incredible piano playing, where is the up tempo beat and her great backup musicians.      Save your money or wait and buy it on Ebay from one of the many disappointed fans.

1416972242|5.0|This series just keeps getting better and better!  I was a little disappointed that Jace and Clary are still siblings, but there are always pieces in the book that make you think twice about everything, including the character's.  Just when you have one pegged, they do something that completely rocks the boat like Clary's friend Simon.  What he turns into is a bit clich&eacute;d, but still ties in nicely with the rest of the story, and is written well.  Plus, you feel the poor thing needs something to help attract Clary not to mention he needs his own \\"powers\\" to assist in their adventures.  The ending does leave you on the edge again (I'm starting to think every YA series has specific instructions to leave readers hanging...), so I would recommend buying the last installment, City of Glass, when you purchase this book.  It's such an original concept with fantastic character's that it truly is a must read trilogy!!!
B0018AK9RA|5.0|I've read a lot of reviews of this CD that are basically more recent fans whining because they didn't get more of the same of what Priest has been doing since Painkiller. These people don't know the history of the band, apparently. My first Priest album was a new release called Stained Class in, which I picked up on vinyl LP in 1978, and which led me back to Sin After Sin, Sad Wings of Destiny and Rocka Rolla. I was a loyal fan until Ram It Down, when I started having doubts, and then Painkiller reinforced my growing belief that Judas Priest's better days were in its past. It seemed like Priest was chasing the crowd rather than leading it. When Halford left, it was over. Ripper Owens did a decent Halford impersonation live, but he had nothing to bring to the table lyrically that compared. So, like most old-time Priest fans, I figured Priest as I'd known it was a thing of the past.<br /><br />When Judas Priest reunited, I bought Angel of Retribution, and I can say that while I wasn't disappointed, I wasn't exactly blown away, either. It reminded me more of Painkiller than the Priest I'd known before. But I can say that with Nostradamus, I am finally convinced that it might just be possible that Judas Priest is REALLY back. This CD doesn't sound like a band that's chasing the pack, trying to cash in on a glorious past, but which is determined to forge new territory. Anyone who liked the old Priest will find something to like in this CD. If I have any complaints, it's that it's a bit long, and it seems unnecessarily so. But the entire CD is a pleasure to listen to, because no one, with the possible exception of Heaven & Hell, is making music like this anymore. It was that epic scope that drew me to Heavy Metal to begin with, and which is sadly lacking in the younger bands that think volume and speed equal legitimacy. With this CD, I think Judas Priest has proven that the old gods have, indeed, returned. If you're an old-timer like me and you liked Judas Priest before they lost their way beginning with Ram It Down and Painkiller, you owe it to yourself, and to the old gods of Heavy Metal, to buy this CD. You will NOT be disappointed.their way beginning with Ram It Down and Painkiller, you owe it to yourself, and to the old gods of Heavy Metal, to buy this CD. You will NOT be disappointed.
1416914307|5.0|WOW!  The last installment in this trilogy met with every hopeful expectation I had!  It was such a great trilogy, that I am already considering reading it all over again.  I will say that the end, while still great, could have used a little work.  The love between Jace and Clary is intense, nothing near as obsessive as in the Twilight series, and understated since they both believe they are each others sibling (which completely sucked for me in the beginning, but it all works out, and the author wrote it very tastefully!  Probably because in the back of your mind, you know they can't really be brother and sister). But I still expected something a little more intense when they are finally alone together at the end.  Instead you get a sprinkling of \\"Yes, I really do care for you, and now we are together,\\" and that's about it.  It was a little anticlimactic for me.  Still written very well...but left me wanting something more.  Especially as it seems some things weren't finished, such as Clary's memories.  Will she ever fully get her memory back?  And who was the female that Magnus was talking to?  So, yes...if the author wanted to, she could make another book to go with the trilogy, which I definitely wouldn't mind!  As it is, I can't wait for her other series to come out!

B001VB8UAE|5.0|As the DVD co-director/producer Gary Smith says, this Streisand concert MUST be documented for generations to come.  Whether or not you're a die-hard fan, owning this piece of history is also a MUST.  Barbra Streisand, the 'perfectionist' also shows the truth in her imperfections.  A missed note, a hoarse voice at times, her connection (or non-connection) with a lyric, everything that makes her human is included here.  Not only the amazing concert of 2006 but a little bit of her maturing process as an artist is here, too.  Watch the newest concert first but be sure to enjoy the look back at her first specials from the mid-sixties, her creative process for her huge success on The Broadway Album. Barbra, thanks for sharing!

B001PJRAUS|1.0|This story had such possbilities.  I was intrigued by the plot of a 21st century girl stepping back in time to my favorite story.  I am really surprised that so many people liked it.  It was terrible.  I rented it from Netflix because of the good reviews.   Where do I start with where it went wrong?  I don't mind if someone changes the story line a bit, but if it is supposed to be Austen's world, please, please retain the integrity, good character, wit and kindness of the main characters as well as the cultural norms of the time.  That is all lost.  Darcy is just plain mean.  Why Amanda likes her is a mystery.  Amanda is vulgar, unlikeable and a liar.  Why Darcy likes her is a mystery.   She also has this annoying habit of speaking in slang which must be used just in England, because I didn't understand some of the phrases she used.  I could tell enough by the context to know they weren't very nice.  Bingley is a drunk and unlikeable.  Georgiana is immoral.  Jane is weak, pathetic and willing to compromise her principles.   Elizabeth is absent.  Miss Bingley and Mr. Collins are changed from being just foolish and arrogant to being downright creepy and perverted. Ugh!  Can I say enough that it was terrible?  Can someone please take the charming idea of stepping back into Austen's world and retain the character, wit, likeability and kindness of the main characters?

B001TH16DS|5.0|The good news is that the Blu-ray FINALLY gets it right. The show looks terrific with a digitally cleaned up transfer. Colors are more vibrant than before. The new CGI effects look quite good particularly in episodes that were redone a bit later (the original visual effects are included, too) and with a newly recorded opening theme as well as the mono original soundtrack. The only weak part is that some of the CGI work needed a bit more detailing in some of the earlier redone episodes but otherwise the visuals are quite accomplished. I particularly found the use of CGI to create some of the alien landscapes to add to the episodes. Kudos to the team that worked on this for also doing a nice 7.1 lossless digital audio mix.<br /><br />Fans will be happy to hear that both  the original visuals and the digital face lift can be viewed via seamless branching and you can toggle between both using the angle button on the remote. The special features are exactly like the previous HD/DVD combo disc that CBS/Paramount released last year. This is the definitive version of \\"Trek\\" (at least until they figure out a way to make this holographic...then you'll have to buy it again).<br /><br />We get PIP's for certain episodes that allow commentary from a variety of \\"Star Trek\\" experts including D.C. Fontana and some of the actors. We also get a very good featurette on re-recording the theme and they found the original track of Shatner's narration over the theme to recreate the opening.<br /><br />The original negatives were used for clean up. Many episodes here have new landscapes seen in long shot that open up the studio where the show was shot. For example, in \\"The Man Trap\\" we see the wasted landscape of teh planet. There are little touches that you might not even notice initially that improve the episodes such as a scene where Scotty is using a phase to burn through a bulkhead in \\"The Naked Time\\" where they forgot to add the animation and it has been added here.<br /><br />I'm really looking forward to the second season since it has one of my favorite episodes and one that benefits the most from the new visual effects--\\"The Doomsday Machine\\" where the visuals varied from very good (the \\"Doomsday Machine\\" itself) to poor (the badly damaged other starship)in the original version of the episode. An ATM model of the Enterprise was burned and used for that episode and it's quite clear it's a smaller, plastic model in the original visual effects. CBS did a spectacular job on that episode creating imaginative visuals for the most part that had qutie a bit more detail and looked more realistic.<br /><br />Being able to see these with both the original effects and remastered ones is the way that this set should have been presented before for the HD/DVD set.<br /><br />Highly recommended.econd season since it has one of my favorite episodes and one that benefits the most from the new visual effects--\\"The Doomsday Machine\\" where the visuals varied from very good (the \\"Doomsday Machine\\" itself) to poor (the badly damaged other starship)in the original version of the episode.

B000026FOA|5.0|Nick Drake came on the folk scene at a time where most folkies wrote songs inspired by blues and country just as much as traditional music.  Drake, however, did the unthinkable by mixing jazz and even classical influences with his music.  His guitar playing here is strong (actually quite technical at times) and its wonderfully backed up by strings, piano, and various other instruments.    This is progressive folk.  Much like progressive rock, it combines its sound with music not normally associated with that particular genre: in this case classical, chamber, and jazz.  This is in direct opposition to the country and blues based music of Bob Dylan and such.  For this reason, this album does not sound very dated at all.  In fact it could have been released today, in the 70s, the 90s ect.  Psychedelic rock and acid rock are so rooted in the 60s, they now sound like artifacts of that era where as this music, which resisted the norms of the time, sounds just as fresh as when it was first released.    Even though the lyrics don't seem to be personal when you listen to them, the music says otherwise.  The album has a very somber atmosphere, most likely associated with Nick Drake's condition.  It's well-known that he died from a pill overdose,and some even think it was a suicide.  He only released a few albums but all of them reveal a tortured mind, expressing itself the best way it could, through music.    Please be advised that this is not a folk album in the traditional sense.  It isn't even a folk-rock album.  Nothing rocks hard here: it doesn't need to.  In a way this music is just as advanced as most progressive rock.  If you're willing to take a chance on a very unique sounding album, then this is a great purchase.

Or you will hate it and go back to your crazy Anti-Obama/socialism, conservative church.(I hope not)       You'll never know who god is unless you read this book.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|This is a movie that has to be seen for the first time on the big screen, not the small one.  One simply can't \\"get\\" the feel and deliciously slow pace of this film over a TV in the den.  It's an indie, small budget, artsy movie, and despite how it's billed, it's not a musical.  If you don't like artsy movies, or most indies, then you wouldn't like this one, either -- because it moves at its own pace and develops the story very slowly.  Kind of like enjoying a romantic, several course meal over several hours in an exotic location, rather than popping down a steak at Outback.  I loved it precisely because it was not sweet and sugary, but savory and a bit salty.
0307263118|5.0|I had the distinct pleasure of reading this short, beautiful book aloud to my son.  To be fair, he's but an infant, so perhaps he couldn't have cared less what I was reading...  However, it was quite the enjoyable experience for me to take it all in at a slow pace.      I will not summarize the plot, as that has been done by other reviewers.  Let me just say that _The Sea_ was deserving of the prestigious Booker Prize and perhaps one of the best Booker-winning books I've read.  This book should be slowly read and enjoyed by many and I'm thrilled to have been introduced to a new author (previously unknown to me).  I will be sending copies as gifts, as _The Sea_ comes HIGHLY RECOMMENDED by this reader.

B001PR0Y4Y|3.0|OK, so if this were 20 years ago, this would be a HUGE hit.<br /><br />This film is totally in the spirit of \\"Fast Times at RIdgemont High\\", except, it is a bit late...<br /><br />It was much cleaner than i expected, nothing like Superbad- i enjoyed the lack of obtuse profanity...<br /><br />The story is basic, predictable and unresolved, but the acting is really good and totally identifiable...<br /><br />overall, I enjoyed it, but would never sit through the whole thing again...<br /><br />but the use of Kennywood was really great, because, after all, i'm from Pittsburgh and i'm  partial.<br />also, they really had a handle on Pittsburgh, it was upheld really really well.

OR might not appease the group's most meatheadishly metal demographic, but I can guess you one thing: this colossal release of darkened melodic embrace sure helped make more female fans.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I first heard about Playing for a Change tonight... it is definatly something you want to hear and to share... the effort this guys put in doing all this is enormous...    The idea of playing for a change moved me, I mean, through history we've known people who have tried to change the world, if we could say that, Ganhdi, Lennon, Bob Marley and many more, but this for me is a total different concept... it envolves people like me... who aren't musicians but love music and enjoy every second of it.    Peace and love is a great thing... and boy does it make you feel good/special.    Peace guys... live every minute of your life cuz you only have one, smile, laugh, love.

0920668372|5.0|I've loved this book since I was a child.  It's about a mother's unconditional love for her son.  The son grows older and gets into trouble, but the mother's love never wavers.  Some people think it's corny the way the mother still treats the man as though he were a baby, but I think it's sweet.  This book makes me want to cry every time I read it!

0618918248|5.0|The irrationality in  religious arguments for the existence of God.    In this book and his related conferences around the world Richard Dawkins rightly demonstrates the irrationality in the arguments put forward for the existence of god. He also correctly analyzes the distorted thinking in major religions of the world and in Creationist dogma under the guise of \\"Intelligent Design\\" and how religions have been harming societies of the world throughout history. He refutes many religious allegations that claim to prove the existence of god one by one by showing the distorted and inconsistent thinking in them. For example, the religious reasoning that if science can not explain a natural event this is proof that the natural event is designed and caused by God and therefore God exists is ludicrous. The fact that something is not yet explained by science is no proof of the existence of God. Many natural events that have scientific explanations today could not be explained scientifically centuries ago. Dawkins gives the example that thousands of years ago humans could not explain the sunrise and concluded therefore that it was an event caused by a diety. Science does not claim to be able to explain everything. However, even  if science can never  explain a certain natural event this does not lead to the logical conclusion that God did it and that God exists.     Somethings can not be proved nor disproved scientifically. For something to constitute a scientific hypothesis it must be falsifiable either by observation and / or experimentation. I recommend that the reader refer to Karl Popper's books on the philosophy of science for details, although the subjectivity of observations has been brought as a counter argument by some people. When somebody makes a claim and says you can not disprove it by science that does not make the claim automatically true. Dawkins quotes the great philosopher Bertrand Russel on that : if somebody were to claim that a teapot was in orbit aroundthe sun between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter this claim could not be proved nor disproved scientifically because at present we don't have telescopes powerful enough to show such a small object so far away from Earth. However, the fact that science can not disprove it does not make the claim true. Dawkins states that similarly the existence of goblins, genies etc. could be, in fact are claimed and their existence can not be disproved scientifically. Using this as an argument that they must therefore exist is illogical and irrational. By the same reasoning, claiming that God exists because science can not prove its non - existence is also ridiculous. If we want to conclude that God exists this must be based on some strong evidence, not necessarily scientific evidence, but some evidence nevertheless. Religion states that creation as explained in the Holy books is evidence. Dawkins demonstrates that holy scripture is not evidence ; it is not based on any rational reasoning. Religious reasoning goes : \\" it is so because the Bible / Kuran say so. You can not question the Holy books because they are scripture downloaded from God. \\"  Dawkins reminds us that scientific reasoning is based on developing scientific hypothesis that can be tested against evidence. Science never claims to have found the ultimate truth, scientific explanations have been developing and changing for the past 400 years. By contrast, all the major religions claim to have the ultimate truth already. They are divine and written in the Bible, the Kuran etc. There is no need to test them because they are divine truths. And if science claims the contary regarding creation etc. it is science that is wrong, because the holy books are divine scripture and God can not be wrong. Dawkins reminds us that religion is based on faith resulting from indoctrination at childhood.    Is God a scientific hypothesis or not ?    I agree with all of Richard Dawkins' comments so far. But  two of his statements in two different parts of his book / lectures seriously contradict one another. On the one hand he says that God should be a scientific hypothesis  subject to proof or disproof like any scientific hypothesis. On the other hand he says that science can not disprove God. By themselves these statements are OK. But taken together they are mutually exclusive ; they can not both be true. If God is a scientific hypothesis we can not say science can not disprove God ; science may not yet have proved or disproved God. But as a scientific hypothesis it should eventually prove or disprove God. If on the other hand the statement that science can not disprove God is true then we can not say that God is or should be a scientifc hypothesis. Because something that can not be proved nor disproved scientifically, like the teapot in orbit around the sun, is not a scientific hypothesis. It seems that Richard Dawkins overlooked this contradiction in these two statements of his. He did not make these statements one after the other ; they are quite separate in his book / lecture. Put the two statements together and the contradiction is obvious. I think Mr. Dawkins needs to make up his mind about this;  can the existence / non- existence of God be a scientific hypothesis or not ? If yes, then he should not say elsewhere in his book / lecture that science can not disprove God. He can say science has not yet disproved nor proved the existence of God. By contrast if he concludes that science can not disprove God then he should drop his other statement that God should be a scientific hypothesis. Both statements can be considered and discussed and perhaps accepted separately, but not together. It is obvious that Dawkins has been analyzing the subject of Religion and God for many years, has traveled the world, discussed with clergy of various religions etc. and is very knowledgeble about it on top of his expertise on biology. I am amazed that with so much knowledge he can fall into such a logical error.Proof / disproof does not have to be scientific.    Whether God should be a scientific hypothesis or not is a discussable issue. However, I wish to add that not everything need be a scientific hypothesis to be fasifiable and / or provable. For example a brilliant detective like Sherlock Holmes can prove who committed a murder by analyzing various evidence and making logical inferences that at the end prove the murder. The method used by the detective is not science no matter how analytical or brilliant it maybe. Yet the proposition of  who committed the murder is falsifiable and provable.     Likewise many analytical and logical thinking methods that lead to proofs / disproofs are not science. For example mathematics, logic, historical analysis etc. are not science. Mathematics is a tool used by science. Many theorems can be proved / disproved mathematically. Some scientifc propositions maybe analyzed and helped to be proved mathematically but mathematical propositions themselves, although provable mathematically, are not falsifiable by observation and therefore not science. If as a reader of this review you find it hard to accept that math is not a science I recommend that you read some material on what science is and is not.  Math is a very valuable analytical tool of science, but is not science itself.    My main point is that if it is concluded that God is a scientific hypothesis its existence / non-existence will eventually be proved or disproved, however long it may take. But it does not need to be a scientific hypothesis to be falsifiable or provable. On the other hand, if it is determined that God can not be a scientific hypothesis this does not mean that existence or non- existence of God can not be proved / disproved. It only means that the God proposition, although unscientific, has not yet been proved nor disproved but may be proved / disproved in the future by some other rational method that is not scientific.  Or it may never be proved / disproved. What is certain is that irrational religious arguments have not proved the existence of God and never will. Any proof / disproof will come from some kind of rational method of reasoning.     Are there any benefits of a religious life ?    Among other subjects he mentions in his book Richard Dawkins says that religious ceremonies such as weddings in churches and the like should still be part of our culture and we should still learn about the Bible and other holy books like we learn about any work of literature. But that we should do these without indoctrination and dogma. When we study the Iliad and similar  works as part of humankind's literature we don't necessarily believe in them. The study of Holy books should be no different.    Do we need religion to have moral lives ?    Dawkins also explains with examples that even though religious faith may sometimes provide psychological comfort, that does not make the religious claims true. The allegation that we must be religious to have moral and ethical lives is false. A person can be good without believing in God.  Among religious people there are many good ones and many immoral ones. Some of the ethical teachings in the Holy books are good morality but many of them  ( Dawkins gives many examples ) are immoral to common sense and downright  detrimental to society.    Who is the audience ?    This book and Dawkins' lectures are very much needed in the contemporary world where religious polarization is on the rise. However, religious people will not read his book nor listen to his lectures. Even if they do they will not change their minds. Because minds that have been shaped by  religious indoctrination since childhood can not be changed by logical arguments and presentation of scientific evidence. Were Galileo and Copernicus able to change the minds of the clergy by presenting scientific evidence of their theories ? Dawkins says that he received some messages from readers that they stopped believing in God and religion after having read his book. But I doubt that they were fundamental advocates of religion in the first place. This book is likely to ( in Dawkins terminology ) \\" raise the conciousness \\" of people who are moderately ( non - fanatic ) religious or non - religious. It has no chance of convincing the religious fanatic. Not because it is not a good book, but because dogmatic belief of any kind is not open to evidence of alternative opinions. In fact, we can see on Dawkins' videos on the internet how he has been insulted by religious leaders around the world when he went to discuss with them. I am sure Dawkins does not intend to convert them, perhaps he wants to expose their intolerance to the general public.    What can we do ?    I am writing this review from a country that has been a secular republic since its establishment in 1923 but has always been under threat of religious fundamentalism. In fact, access to Richard Dawkins' website is blocked by court decision from this country, no doubt as a result of religious fanatic initiative.     I think the challenge facing the secular people in various countries in the world is keeping secular education alive and ensuring that children are brought up with secular - not necessarily atheist - methods of thinking.    In his concluding remarks, Dawkins does not recommend parents to indoctrinate their children to become atheists, although he is an atheist himself. He says don't indoctrinate your children with religion and don't label them as catholic, protestant, moslem or jewish children. They  ARE NOT catholic, protestant, moslem or jewish children. They are children of catholic, protestant,moslem or jewish parents. Labelling children as young as 4 years of age with religion is as ridiculous as labelling them as socialist, marxist, capitalist, keynesian, monetarist etc. Therefore Dawkins advises parents to let the children decide themselves when they become adults what they think of religion and of the holy books. Do not indoctrinate them to believe the Bible, the Kuran or atheism at a young age. This is very good advice, but unfortunately only a minority of the populations in many countries have the capability to provide a secular education for their children. I hope that secular education will become more widespread leaving the choice to be an aetheist or religious to the individual  without indoctrinating him / her to be either. However, I am not too optimistic that this will ever be possible on a wide scale.    Is Richard Dawkins taking security measures to protect himself ?    I see on his videos on the internet that he goes around the world to discuss with leaders of militant Islam, with fundamentalist Christians and although he appears to be courteous on the videos he says that he is an atheist and is often insulted. His views are too extreme for religious people to tolerate and I am worried that he maybe attacked one day. It does not appear on the videos that he is taking any security measures.
B001PJ7TUE|5.0|UK electronic Dance outfit The Prodigy recently topped the UK albums chart with this, their 5th studio album. Comprizing their trademark aggressive feel, buzzing riffs, frenetic beats, spare lyrics and Rock edge, it is classic Prodigy which should please fans.<br /><br />Lead-off single \\"Omen\\" is a perfect example of this, a fierce upbeat number with a nice xylophone break and repeated refrain \\"Now the writing's on the wall/ It won't go away/ It's an omen\\". Incredibly catchy! \\"Thunder\\" with clipped beats, has a Ragga-style chorus (much like \\"Out of space\\").  \\"Take me to the hospital\\" has jittery synths and skittery beats with disembodied/vocodered vocals.<br /><br />Other standouts are \\"Colours\\" (with spacey/video game sound effects), \\"Warrior dance\\" (the current single with female vocals, a bit similar to \\"Firestarter\\"), \\"Run with the wolves\\" (with Foo Fighter Dave Grohl demolishing those drums), \\"Omen reprise\\" (with icy Techno strings dominating and \\"It won't go away\\" repeated), and closing cut \\"Stand up\\", an almost sublime retro sounding instrumental peppered with horns (and sampling the riff off Manfred Mann Chapter Three's \\"One Way Glass\\") which sounds like nothing else on the album.<br /><br />\\"I hear thunder / but there's no rain / This kind of thunder breaks walls and windowpanes\\" go the lyrics to \\"Thunder\\". They sure are right!!
B001PPLJIQ|3.0|This film is very well made, you believe in the 50s Germany shown, the actors are great. However, it is 2009, how long are we going to get movies about \\"Nazi\\" Germans? Again and again the world is reminded what Germans did 70 years ago. Now take the \\"SS Camp\\" premise out of the plot - would the movie feel the same? Say the protagonist would have killed someone in civil time and received a life sentence?     But most important is this. The main character Hanna Schmitz prefers life imprisonment to being exposed as illiterate and thus saving her life. Is it because she all of a sudden felt the guilt to pay off, or was simply psychologically underdeveloped? In any case, 20 years later she admitted she didn't feel anything special about what she had done. One cannot believe that a human being would go to prison than to learn to read. This is where you stop believing the movie and realise it's a fantasy chick flick.

B001K3JF7K|3.0|I have been a big fan of Diana Krall since I discovered her one of a kind talent watching the Live in Paris DVD. Diana Krall has matured a lot over the last few years with great recoding experiences with acclaimed arrangers like Claus Ogerman who arranged for great artists like Tom Jobim and Frank Sinatra. This CD shows Diana's commitment to playing great Bossa Nova standards like So Nice and Corcovado. The recording quality is great, the music selection is nice, but it lacks a little swing that she always puts in most of her CDs. Her voice continues to conquer many new lovers of her music, but she should stick with the English lyrics, because singing in Portuguese was not such a great idea due to her strong English accent. This CD is nice to listen to at night.

B000T05R8Q|5.0|This is less a review and more a personal account.  This collection remains of limited value to a more headbanging Floyd fan who thinks the apex of their output remains \\"The Wall.\\"  It does not.  While that 1979 work was imaginitively and magnificently packaged, as music it was a self-absorbent paean to rock excess - and an embarrassment to fans of Nick Mason and the late, great Richard Wright.<br /><br />\\"The Wall\\" describes a moment in time but is not especially enduring in the way that \\"Piper\\" remains the blueprint and the Bible for Space Rock throughout the world.  It deliciously takes on territory only accessed at the time by Sun Ra both thematically and in approach to performance - and establishing a chapter and verse music theory still in use by Space Rock musicians some forty years later.  Absent only synthesizers and sequencers which were unavailable to the band in 1967, it's all there: Eastern influences conveyed through Wright's surefired right hand; the sliding guitar technique masterfully hatched by Barrett (and dubbed \\"Glissando Guitar\\" by Gong's Daevid Allen, who appropriately credits Barrett as the inventor of the technique); nuanced percussion that ranges from bells and vibes to gongs and kettle drums, played with incredible dynamism by Nick Mason; and Waters, leading the way both with his bass guitar played in the melodic range, and with the various sound effects he produced simply with his mouth.<br /><br />As regards the various criticisms about the songs not presented:  \\"King Bee\\" and \\"Lucy Leave Me\\" were Screaming Abacabs demos at best, and will never be officially released.  Forget it.  As for \\"Vegetable Man\\"... once again, forget it.  Neither the remaining members of Pink Floyd, nor the estates of Wright and Barrett, nor EMI, will ever allow it.  Chances are, if you  wanted to hear it, you've already heard it.  You know how incredible it is.  You know it was remastered pretty admirably in the lawless gray area known as Italy.  Accept matters for what they are.<br /><br />The remarkable things about the 3-disc set include the presentation of an original artistic booklet by Barrett which is truly incredible and beautiful; the version of \\"Matilda Mother\\" with completely different lyrics; and one of the versions of \\"Interstellar Overdrive\\" which is tougher and grungier, more garage-y, than any live version or studio take I have ever heard.  It's a revelation.  The power bespeaks the energy of Barrett's Floyd, and lays to rest any notion that Space Rock has to be morose, or laid back, or wishy-washy.  It doesn't.  It never did.  As per this bold example, Space Rock can invoke almost a street toughness and remain inspirational, spitirual, and visionary.re.

0061562408|5.0|I wanted to get this book when it was offered at Starbucks but didn't want to break loose with the cash for a new hardback.  Luckily I saw it at a used book store and picked it up for $4.  Sure glad I did.    This is a delightful book on many levels.  People just interested in racing or dogs would like it.  On a more intellectual level, one can compare the skills needed to race in the rain with the skills needed to navigate life's crises.      It's a short book, easy reading too.  If you have a dog, you might never look at him in the same way again.

B001NZ1IGG|5.0|Listening to this album for the first time I wasn't sure what to expect. Heavy and fast or more bluesy rock stuff? I'm a fan of Pearl Jam's earlier albums and the Temple of the Dog project too.    Mother Love Bone feels like a mash-up of Guns 'n Roses and Temple of the Dog. This may sound odd, but it's the most accurate description that came to mind. I love it, and I can see why their being cut short was so tragic. It would be interesting to have a band like this still around today.     I highly recommend it to fans of 80's rock and 90's grunge. Worth a listen!
B00192KCQ0|3.0|This will undoubtedly be just a drop in the ocean of reviews of this album, but here goes.<br />The songs are the best batch they've come up with in a long time. The guys just sound like they're going for it. They sound hungry. I won't throw out any \\"And Justice For All comparisons, because this doesn't have the dry, tightly structured feel of that. This is much more like \\"Master of Puppets\\".<br />Now on to the real issue. I've been reading everywhere about the issues people have with the sound of the CD. I hadn't checked the album out yet, so I figured I'd dive in. I have pretty good ears - can you hear the high pitch coming out of a TV even if there's no sound? - so I will simplify the audio argument. I don't speak in + or - dBs and I won't talk about waveforms and clipping (though it is a very simple concept). For people who don't know what to listen for - like that *%@# idiot Jim from \\"That Metal Show\\" - this is for you. Cue up \\"My Apocalypse\\". Flattened guitars for thirty seconds and then Lars comes in with the double time (at 0:31). And everything turns to mud. It's like the guitars are eating the drums or vice versa. REALLY LISTEN to his drums. You can hear the snare hits sure, but what about the high and low end? They are almost completely gone. Your mind is telling you that he's killing that kick drum, but you can hardly hear it. It's got a sound like someone thwacking a rubber eraser on a school desk. The same with the cymbals. You sense they're being hit, but it barely registers as an actual sound.<br />Now, does this affect the enjoyment of the music? I think so. I had a headache after listening deeply to \\"My Apocalypse\\" at medium volume on headphones, and I often listen to Sunn O))) and Boris at 2/3 volume with no problems.<br />I have now acquired the Guitar Hero 3 versions of the album. Thank God for torrents (ha ha Lars). The sound is much more balanced. The guitars don't jump out at you like the album mix does, but the music has a better overall feel. You can hear the cymbal hits, the bass is more present. Though the bass drum still sounds a bit odd (that must've been the way it came through originally). You'll have to turn this up a bit more than the release version to enjoy it, but it sounds better loud than that one does. The GH 3 mix actually sounds a lot more like an album Rick Rubin would produce. \\"Reign In Blood\\" and the first Danzig album come to mind.<br />So if you can get a hold of both versions of the songs, I think you'll find this mix much easier on your cranium. Kudos to Metallica for making this kicka$$ music. It's just too bad the controversy over the distorted mix detracts from the fact that this is a GREAT ALBUM!r the cymbal hits, the bass is more present.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|I grew up playing Monopoly, Risk, Chinese Checkers, whatever I could get my hands on (I realize Chinese Checkers seems a bit odd in that list, but I did play it sometimes...).  I even would play Monopoly by myself when I couldn't find anyone else to play with (I know... I know...).    Now in my 30s, I try and have people over whenever possible (once every 2 or 3 months) to have a \\"Game Night\\" where we play whatever games the number of people over will accommodate.  When my wife and I are on vacation, we play Rook or other games.    So, basically, I love games.    When I read a Wired article about this game (the title \\"Monopoly Killer\\" is why I bought the magazine), I had to rush out and get it (on Amazon... I figure saving money is better than playing the next day).    I was not dissapointed... I loved it.  My wife loved it.  Three different couples we had over loved it.  Everyone loves it.  The first time I've ever had a game that not a single person said \\"I'll sit the next one out\\".  When we had to get up at 4am for a flight the next day, we played until 1am.    The only downside (which isn't really a downside) is that it's only 3 or 4 players.  Not 2, not 5.  However, there is a 5-6 player extension (which is being delivered to my house in 2 days).  There are also a gazillion extensions for other game play.    I cannot rave enough about this game.  I absolutely believe in 5-10 years (maybe sooner) it will become a household name (game) like Monopoly.  If you like games that involve more than just rolling the dice (like Yatzee, which I will also gladly play), pick it up.    Not only is every game different, but there are many different strategies to try and get to the goal.  Each of which will not work in every game (depending on the board layout).    To quote another favorite game of mine, it takes a few minutes to learn, and a lifetime to master.
B001L5SXQG|3.0|I waited a couple months to let this sink in, see the show in Denver, then see how I felt about WOAD.  The fact the Bruce is down to only doing a couple songs of it each night, should tell us something.  Either he feels the songs are out of touch with how peole feel right now, or he's not overly pleased with how they play live.  My feeling is he stuck gold on about half the songs, others sound like fillers (which Bruce would never do).  Can't quite put my finger on what is missing on some (Queen, Life Ifself, Good Eye, Love Can Do), while others soar (Kingdom, Lucky, WOAD, This Life).  He may have been better off putting out an EP of 4-5 songs, snice these are leftovers from Magic, and just went to work on something fresh.  Like that he tried to creat some new sounds, kinda 60's pop feel which the E-Street Band pulls off, but can't get past the feeling of it being an incomplete project.
031606792X|5.0|This book lived up to my expectations at least. I thought that the sontinuity of the story was fine. I know a lot of people were let down and I can't say that I was thrilled that everyone got their \\"happily ever after\\"! What is it about humans that we need people to lose?? Bella's story was great. The birth scene made me nauseous but past that I really thought it was a great story! All the way through.
B001PPLJIQ|3.0|A great performance by Winslet in a film which is so so because I think it loses direction.     Ralph Fiennes asking her what she had learned is a good question, because I'm not so sure what the director wants us to take away from this overlong mishmash.    The parts with her and the young lover were great, he is a super actor, but I never know why she walked out on him, and he never asks.    He could have gone to see her and avoided her getting the 20 year to life sentence, and he does nothing--one life or 300, what is the difference?     It was an odd, uneven movie, so praise to Winslet for being so believable.     Fiennes seems to be the same in all his films these days, tight-lipped and uptight, with a range about an inch wide.      David Kross the young man a great newcomer-some really lovely parts like the bike tour, some really flat parts like with Gertrude, whom I guess he marries to get the daughter he has later in life, but once Winslet is off screen, the movie just sort of stutters to a halt, IMHO.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|great cd  we liked it so much we wanted to buy it.  No problems with the order.
B000E41JUC|4.0|This is not a CD for a newbie to Porcupine Tree but rather for the completist fan who watched this band evolve into the major musical force it is today.
B001UREJWM|5.0|This new CD is album of the year, in my opinion.  If you love Dio-era Sabbath, you will not be disappointed.  From the opening notes of the first song through the end, this is one is an instant classic.  Have you heard the single, Bible Black?  It one driving Metal tune.    This album is as good as Mob Rules, Heaven and Hell or Dehumanizer.  Get it, what are you waiting for?
B000002504|4.0|When I heard this CD it reminded me what a complex band Gentle Giant was and just listening to one of their albums took more then one sample. They get better with each listen. The melodies that I didn't hear the first time came through with repeated sessions. This is a voyage through musical history when master musicians ruled the industry.
031606792X|5.0|As a man who lost his wife and daughter to the Cullen's and their fantastic world; I was very skeptical and somewhat jealous of the world Stephenie Meyers has created.    After I saw the Twilight movie - i because interested and picked up the first audio book - WHAM - i was sideswiped by a manner of storytelling I had never imagined possible.  I found myself standing still as a statue out of fear of missing any part of these amazing stories!  They are truly incredible works that I, as a husband and father, eagerly and gratefully enjoy with my Wife and Daughter.    Attention all you guys who want a good fantasy story - this is one you won't soon forget!  Even if you struggle through the first 3 books - the last one is ultimately MAN book!!! Full of action, adventure, suspense, blood, and best of all - an ending to rival any X-Men story you've ever heard!    Get a book cover if your afraid of being seen reading a chick-book - you wont regret it!
B00005K3O4|4.0|Oh man, is this one ever entertaining.  I watched this the same day I saw Clownhouse, and boy, was this much better!  Killer Klowns is a crazy movie, very funny (the clowns are hilarious and very cool) at times, sometimes spooky at times, and just inspired lunacy the whole way through.<br /><br />Right from the start, the cheesy, campy and downright cool 80's theme for this movie sets the tone, and it gets more campy and enjoyahble from there.  The movie borrows many campy elements, monsters coming down to eat lifeforms, something like a mend of old horror movies, only with the actual intention to make you laugh.  It makes the movie hilariously enjoyable and absurd, instead of just making you laugh at how stupid it looks.  Of course, the plot absolutely rules as well.  I mean, what's cooler than alien clowns that wrap their victims in cotton candy to drink, color the walls a circus color, use a human for a marionatte, and can eat people with their shadows?  That's right, nothing!<br /><br />So what makes the humor cool?  Well, the exploding, acidic pies are just plain cool, and when a clown puts the cherry on top of the pile of acidic pies, that's funny.  When you see a frail old man, pathetically yelling at the circus tent to give him back his dog, that's funny.  When you see a fat clown drink one of his victims through a straw, that's funny.  Oh, and the comedic duo that drives the ice cream is hysterical to watch, there so oblivious, comical, and stupid they are worth more than one genuine laugh.  And the sets are cool to look at, and especially when they are decorated.  It ends well too, as the every good guy dies is tiring and as lame as a glittering happy ending in these kind of slasher films.<br /><br />Simply put, watch this movie, and prepare to have some laughs.  The way that this movie does with the horror genre is just great.<br /><br />B
B0000VCZKM|5.0|My grand daugher is very fond of this movie. She has watched it many times and plans to take it on her trip to the Cape in the summer.
B001CW7ZXK|5.0|A must have if you don't already own the film, as it has special feature from prevoius versions.
B001PPLJJ0|5.0|To be clear from the beginning, this is not a movie for family viewing.  Throughout much of the early portions of the film viewers are treated to relatively graphic nudity for both Kate Winslet and the young man (David Kross) that plays the younger version of Ralph Fiennes.<br /><br />The film covers the tale of Hanna (Winslet) and Michael (Fiennes/Kross) and their relationship and lives.  The setting is NOT World War II, but is actually post WWII, starting in 1958, as well as portions set in the 60's and 70's, up thru the 1990's.<br /><br />Rather than spoiling the story, I'll stop providing details on the story there, and simply say it is quite interesting.  The story is based on a best-seller by Bernhard Schlink, and the filmed version features an award winning performance by Kate Winslet (Academy Award and Golden Globe).  On Blu-ray the film looks beautiful showing excellent detail and clarity.  The audio quality is also excellent though the film is not an action-thriller and doesn't feature the typical booming explosions and sound effects.<br /><br />Most definitely worth viewing, but again not something that most families would screen around younger family members.  The R rating is most definitely deserved for the graphic nudity.  The language is actually surprising clean as the film focuses on the story rather than mixing in profanity just for shock value.  Not necessarily a film that will be watched repeatedly, but definitely a film worth viewing.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|Angelina Jolie gives an oscar nominated best actress performance in this true story of a mother who lost her son and who goes thrugh hell in trying to find him. With no help from the police she goes through some some bad hardships with friends with her to finally find the truth as to what really happened to her son..A MUST SEE...
B000MTFFZY|5.0|This is one of the best CDs ever. Delain is among the kings of melodic heavy (goth) metal. Each song is a hit. Amazing. Outstanding. Definitely a best buy from many perspectives.
B001MEJY8W|5.0|I have no other choice but to give this five stars, although I feel sickened in my bones by doing so.  My hat goes off to the writer/director as he really pushed the envelope and crossed the line to the world that is completely unspeakable and horrifying.  For years I have studied horror and have watched every horror film and read every horror book I can get my hands on.  Never before have I witnessed such a piece of work that has crossed such boundaries.<br /><br />I understand that one of the points for creating this, as mentioned at the before the film started, was to express freedom.  All I can say is the Marquis De Sade would be quite delighted with this work.  As much as I desperately do not want to call this art, technically it is, as I believe the art of the film is the gore and torture.<br /><br />Regardless of what I have witnessed, I'm nervous but excited to see further works from this specific creator.  With Martyrs I feel new ground has been covered and I really feel like I can say I've seen it all now.
B001TCAT9U|5.0|It is nice to see that the fans have not deserted this legendary band!  There has been a bit of a foul taste in my mouth from the critics' bashing of this record in various magazines.  It is interesting to me in this current trend of \\"rock-electro\\" and \\"80's New Wave\\" style mish-mash that critics attack a band that made head way and pioneered many of the styles that are imitated ferociously today.  The band's use of analog synths on \\"Sounds Of The Universe\\" establish a beautiful mosaic and the songs are crafted to lend repeated listens.  The mix is phenomenal.  I will not compare this record to a past one because in my opinion it truly stands alone.  Since \\"Playing The Angel\\" it has been great to see David Gahan's songwriting brought into play.  Martin and Dave's relationship seems to be stronger than ever and they sound wonderful together these days!  Since the songs have been broken down in past reviews, I will simply highlight some stand outs:<br /><br />\\"In Chains\\" - This is classic mode!<br />\\"Wrong\\" - A refined and perfect single not unlike \\"Martyr\\"!<br />\\"In Sympathy\\" - Simple yet complex!<br />\\"Peace\\" - Fantastic electronic song!  Martin and Dave sound amazing!<br />\\"Come Back\\" - Do I hear second single?<br />\\"Jezebel\\" - Martin's best vocal track since \\"Home\\"!<br />\\"Corrupt\\" - Powerful way to end the record!<br /><br />Rather than attack the critics, I do urge them to have a good listen to the album.  Sure they have their opinion, but I think they are \\"WRONG\\"!
0763630497|5.0|I occasionally like watching birds out a kitchen window or when sitting quietly beneath a tree. I'm not a birder, but after looking through and reading THE CUCKOO'S HAIKU AND OTHER BIRDING POEMS, I found myself wanting to purchase a pair of binoculars and waking up early in the morning to go look for some pretty birds.  The book examines twenty-four different birds by dividing the birds into seasons.  Each bird is featured in brilliant watercolors on its own page with a haiku that reveals something about the bird.  Both the haikus and illustrations are beautiful.  Besides the haiku, there are a few notes about the bird on each page. The book concludes with several pages where the author gives a few more sentences to each bird explaining how the haiku for that bird developed and why certain words were used.  The birds in the book are the Eastern Bluebird, Canada Goose, American Goldfinch, Northern Cardinal, American Crow, Ruby-throated Hummingbird, Mourning Dove, Chimney Swift, Belted Kingfisher, Barred Owl, Great Blue Heron, Pleated Woodpecker, Northern Mockingbird, Common Grackle, Cedar Waxwing, White-breasted Nuthatch, European Starling, American Robin, Black-billed Cuckoo, Dark-eyed Junco, Wild Turkey, Blue Jay, House Sparrow, and the Purple Finch.<br /><br />THE CUCKOO'S HAIKU is marketed as a children's book and though children can enjoy the book, the book also makes an excellent gift for adults who like to go birding.  I could easily see the book being used as a field book by a grandparent as they go birding with their grandchildren.

0345495004|4.0|In the early years of the 20th century, Frank Lloyd Wright left his wife and took up with Mamah Borthwick Cheney, a married woman with whom he shared a grand passion that lasted until her death.  This book is written from Mamah's point of view and details the beginning of the affair, when Wright was hired to build the Cheneys a house, through the illicit couple's expatriate years in Europe, and the struggles to live together in Wisconsin, in Taleisin, the home Frank built for Mamah.  Mamah's heartbreak over leaving her children is quite touching, but her love for Frank is irresistible, and she follows her heart, divorcing her guiltless husband and withstanding the public scandal the two lovers caused.    Horan's research is obvious, and Mamah comes to life here. She met and was inspired by a Swedish feminist, Ellen Key, for whom she became a translator. She was educated and thoughtful, useful and collaborative with Wright from the beginning. She tried to remain a good mother to her children, and gradually a peace developed between Mamah and her ex, and the children spent long summers with Mamah at Taleisin.     A warning though - there is a tragedy at the end of the book, one that I remember having read about somewhere previously, but if one is unprepared, it is shocking. Taleisin was the scene of one unspeakably horrific day, when its inhabitants became victims of a servant who had lost his mind. It's necessary to include the details in the book, of course, but jarringly unpleasant - random madness is hard to take, and knowing it to be factual is worse.
0375842209|5.0|Not too often you find a book that you resonate with, that moves you so deeply that it becomes part of your Top Ten list that you share with others.  Such is this masterpiece of story telling.  It is a commonplace in literature to write in the voice of a narrator and I'm sure this is not the first to use (the angel of) death.  However, the humanistic portrayal of the narrator softens what would be a natural aversion.  Who wants to feel good about death?  But, like so much of the book, we are drawn closer to 'him' and without feeling sorry for him or his task we are brought into his world in an open and friendly way.      Almost all books about the last great war and the Holocaust in particular are depressing as befits the realities of the history.  Personally I was deeply offended by the film \\"Life is beautiful\\" as I felt it was unbelievable and disrespectful to those victims.  This book however has one overall humanizing touch; everyone is portrayed by the narrator without judgements, malice and surprisingly, without anger or hate.  Just the opposite of what most authors portray when dealing with wars and barbarism.  Death's perspective is believable because he is merely an emissary of the Divine will, doing what 'he' was created for and although he expresses his views,opinions and observations, they never interfere in his work.  That is something I had not anticipated when I started the book.      The book is actually many biographies of various souls with the central focus on a foster child and her relationships with her foster dad and her boyfriend.  The inclusion of the Jew seeking refuge filled out the other major relationship.  This is a deeply heartbreaking, harrowing and emotionally challenging book but one that I did not want to end.  We see the good die, the bad die and we have to ask, what is our response? What does this author mean to say about the tragedy of human choices and how we get caught up in events much larger than the daily life in a small town?  Even though we are reminded many times that we all will die one day, when we observe the deaths of others we still flinch and cry.      The unique writing style reminded me of Sterne's \\"Tristram Shandy\\" and was used to great effect.      This is really not a book well suited to young people but is best read by a mature audience who is prepared to take a deep and long look at what humanity perpetrates on each other.  One of the best books I've read and most highly recommended.  Extraordinary achievement and not to be missed.
0385340990|5.0|Wonderful, fast read. I love historical fiction and this one had me hooked on the first page! I have a particular interest in WWII and love reading fiction and non-fiction about this time period.
1401309666|4.0|Essential reading to understand the power of so-called \\"Web 2.0\\" which I prefer to call participative technologies.  Repetitive and overlong after you get the point.  But if you are a dimwit, then I guess the book's the right length.
0446343129|5.0|I remember my mother reading The Sugar Blues when I was about 7 years old (so it must have been around 1988).  I remember, even at that age, the things she explained to me as she went through our kitchen and threw out every food containing any form of sugar.  We almost starved that first week, but as a result of this book and my mother's dedication, I was probably the only 7 year old who knew all the various names for \\"sugar\\" that you will read on the back of any box of processed food.  Even though we slowly relaxed our \\"hard core\\" stance on sugar, our family never resumed eating as much sugar as we had formerly.  My dad's chronic headaches improved drastically, and my mother would no longer wake up and barely be able to reach the kitchen for food before passing out.  Even as a young child I had frequent headaches, and they improved for me as well.  As an adult I am ready to re-introduce this kind of food-lifestyle for my own family, and the principles I learned as a child in The Sugar Blues are where I will be starting.

B001PA0FFO|5.0|Great theatrical producions don't always transfer to great film, but DOUBT certainly does.  John Patrick Shanley's Pulitzer Prize winning play is a powerhouse film with every cast member giving brillant performances. In a world where issues are too often painted in black and white, DOUBT reminds the audience that discussion and discourse are vital in the search for truth.
B001YYQ9SS|5.0|As a rabid fan of FF7 I had eagerly awaited the release of Advent Children in theaters and when that didn't happen (except for a single screening in Hollywood) I eagerly awaited the DVD. When it finally was released I tore open the packaging and started the disc spinning and to my disappointment I was only mildly diverted. There was something missing. Yeah my favorite characters were there, the battle scenes (while difficult to follow) were dynamic and epic, and it all looked pretty. But the soul of my FF7 experience was missing. So I shrugged, chalked it up to over-anticipation, and played through the game again to get my fix.     Then Final Fantasy Advent Children Complete was announced. Skeptical but hopeful at the idea of 30 extra minutes I sought out more information. There wasn't much to be had except the odd trailer here and there. Then I was fortunate enough to get my hands on the April 16 Japanese release.     I was blown away.    Advent Children Complete is everything the original cut should have been and so much more. The 30 additional minutes not only add depth and soul to the story but improve the pacing and the structure overall. The characters have room to breathe, the humor is well timed, the action is breathtaking, and the 1080p resolution must be seen to be believed.    Ladies and Gentlemen, because of this release I'm buying a PS3 so that I can purchase the American Version when it is released this summer (plus of course FF13!).    This is the Final Fantasy movie we all have been waiting for!
B000002G9S|5.0|If you look at the collected works of Free, the trend is more toward an ongoing series of hot singles than rock-solid albums...except for this one. From start to finish, it's a textbook of British blooze rock that's been followed by scores of bands that followed in their footsteps. Listen to the title track and reconsider Lynyrd Skynyrd's \\"Saturday Night Special\\" and \\"On The Hunt\\"...both of which might as well be Free tunes filtered through Deep South sensibilities.     The vocal phrasing, the lock-step plodding of the guitars and rhythm section, the serpentine, distorted guitar solo...and around the one minute mark, when Paul Rodgers sings the brief falsetto \\"Baby I'm gonna LEAVE you now,\\" you'll hear the roots of another Ronnie Van Zandt nuance.    The strength of the album, of course, is that these songs have been played to death...and played some more after that...none of which diminishes their undying strength. Even \\"All Right Now\\"...one of the most over-exposed songs EVER...still thrills with its opening licks.    Rodgers and Kirke eventually picked up their marbles and headed over to Bad Company, but let's take a moment to acknowledge one of the most under-appreciated guitarists, Paul Kossoff.  His first solo album (which includes Free and one of the best songs in the band's history, \\"Molten Gold\\") is essential listening: [[ASIN:B00133FB3O Back Street Crawler]] lets you know that this was far from a one-man band or a launching pad for Paul Rodgers' Bad Company / Solo / Queen work.
B001UREJWM|5.0|I've been listening to Sabbath since 1970..I have everything they ever made and this album is one of my favorites. DIO is in his mid to late 60's and he STILL sounds incredible! the guy must have made a deal with the devil ( no pun intended ), Tony Iommi still has the chops and Geezer and Vinny are the backbone of the band. First off the production is amazing DIO's vocals are in your face and the Bass and drums are deep and loud, but clear. Everysong on here rocks, of course there are slow plodding \\"Sabbathesque\\" songs on this album and there should be. If you love the first Heaven & Hell album your going to love this album...The highlights for me are:<br /><br />Double the pain<br />Rock n roll Angel<br />Bible Black<br />Eating the Cannibals<br />Follow The Tears..<br /><br />One of the best albums of 2009!
0061120081|5.0|I re-read this book for the third time this year and it gets better each time I read it.  I think that as we get older, it is easier to integrate all the experiences and wisdom that are inherent in 'To Kill a Mockingbird'.  However, as I think back, I loved it just as much in my younger years when I felt the same passions and was closer in age to Scout and Jem.<br /><br />The book is about a family in Maycomb, Alabama during the height of the great depression.  Atticus Finch, an attorney, is a widower raising two children, Scout and Jem.  The book is told from Scout's viewpoint.  She is a precocious girl about 10 years old.  The Finches have a full-time housekeeper, a black woman who is much like a surrogate mother to them.<br /><br />Maycomb, Alabama is very stratified at this time.  There is the white section and the black section, the middle class white section and the poor white section.  The Finches' , though struggling like everyone during the depression, are considered middle class.<br /><br />The story is about the trial of a black man, Tom Robinson, who is accused of raping a white woman.  Atticus Finch decides to represent him and this creates all kinds of challenges for the family from the white community.  The black community is very thankful towards Atticus and his family.  Scout and Jem have to deal with their own struggles in school due to the stratification of the town and the many families that are angry at Atticus for taking the case.<br /><br />The story unfolds beautifully.  There is a wonderful cast of characters living on the Finches' street that we get to meet through Scout's eyes.  I think that as children, we all had those folks in our neighborhood that we liked or feared or thought were just plain mean.  We meet these folks on Scout's street. We also get to view the trial through Scout's eyes.<br /><br />I recommend this book for everyone starting in high school.  It is a book that has lasting power, that will be read for generations to come.  It has universal themes of love, hate, racism, poverty, wealth, and community.  Harper Lee is a great writer who has written an American classic.e, racism, poverty, wealth, and community.  Harper Lee is a great writer who has written an American classic.
B001DJLCPO|5.0|I loved this film! It is the perfect synthesis of creativity, good writing, talented acting, and scenery that sweeps the mind into flights of imagination. The concept of a society in which everyone wears a mask, and then to add a mirrormask into the mix, a mask that reflects the beholder's own image that in place of the wearer's face....brilliance. The first time I saw it MirrorMask instantly became one of my favorite movies and since then I've  seen it easily fifteen times. It's that wonderful. I'd also like to add that Stephanie Leonidas is one of the best twenty-something actresses out there today!
B001NR8F2O|2.0|Just like they did with the Kissology DVD's (especially the third one) and Alive 3 (the shows during the Revenge Tour all had 25-27 songs compared to the weak 16 that is Alive 3), Kiss has released yet another incomplete concert. The actual show, which was played on New Year's Eve 1999 in Vancouver, had 20 songs, compared to the 17 here (missing from this MP3 version are Shock Me, Cold Gin, and Detroit Rock City). Could they at least have cut Into the Void, that worthless Ace Frehley song from the joke that was Psycho Circus , and given us Shock Me? And what's a Kiss live album without Detroit Rock City? Seriously guys?    But wait, the news gets better. If you were one of the die-hards that bought the Kiss Alive box set that came out a few years ago--the only place you could initially get this concert--you received an even more incomplete show. That version of the concert only had 15 songs (it was missing Shock Me, Cold Gin, Detroit Rock City, God of Thunder, and 2000 Man). So, basically, Kiss released this exclusive concert with the box set only to re-release it as an MP3 download with a few extra tracks later, and it's still incomplete! Would it have been so damn hard to make a nice 2 cd set with the whole show?    But wait, there's more. Like they've done on every single live album they've ever made (Alive 1, 2, 3, and the travesty that is Alive 4, it was supposed to be this show but then they came up with the great idea of doing that lousy symphony thing) Kiss went into the studio and doctored the recordings, re-recorded parts, whatever it is that they \\"need\\" to do. I can't understand for the life of me why Kiss always insists on doing this? I have a ton of Kiss bootlegs, and you know what? They sound fine. For some reason, Gene, Paul and co. are so insecure that they can't give us an unpolished, COMPLETE, live album. Would that be so much to ask from the fans who have made a bunch of average musicians billionaires?    You know what the really sad thing is though? I, and millions more like me, will continue to support Kiss, to buy their albums, shirts, concert tickets (at ridiculously exorbitant prices because no band has the balls to attempt to cripple the Ticketmaster monopoly) etc., even though they've routinely shown a complete disregard for their fans (despite their repeated claims to the contrary) by continually releasing incomplete, overdubbed trash and a million greatest hits albums. Why not free up some vault space by releasing some of the thousands of (unedited) live recordings that every band in the world has stored away? I guess that would be too much to ask from fans that have shown nothing but unflinching loyalty, even in the darkest of times (Music from the Elder, Peter Criss' unforgivably terrible drumming during the latter half of his second stint with the band).
B001YXZL7E|5.0|The Kill Bill Vol. 1 soundtrack proves that Tarantino knows how to pick his music.  From Nancy Sinatra's voice to short sound clips, you're able to reminisce to the time when you first saw the movie.  However, as with most movie soundtracks, this will likely be more to a fan's liking over someone who didn't watch or just didn't like the movie.
B000F9RB9Y|4.0|The Blu-Ray version is crisp and clear and the soundtrack is excellent. The menu setup is great looking and easy to navigate.    Some of the special effects are showing their age (maybe even a little more with this version since it is in HD and shows every little detail)....it was a little distracting at times and pulled me away from the story a bit, but overall it isn't that bad since the story is so powerful and interesting.    I would recommend this movie.
B001C4CI8U|4.0|you can't mention Fringe without at least mentioning The X-Files in passing- since Fringe is this generation's version of The X-Files.  Fringe borrows the same abnormal and paranormal themes.<br /><br />that being said, since TXF is now history, I look at Fringe as \\"the next best thing\\" in terms of suspense, intrigue, and the paranormal being broadcast these days on TV.  Beyond any doubt, Fringe is one of the best produced shows currently on TV b/c the writing is so clever and we (the audience) actually care about the characters and the struggles they go through.<br /><br />The cast could not be better:  John Noble is superb, and Anna Torv and Josh Jackson have good chemistry together (much like Scully and Mulder).<br /><br />Producer JJ Abrams (Lost, Alias, Star Trek, Mission:  Impossible 3) has another winner on his hands with Fringe.<br /><br />* Highly recommended *
B000MTFFZY|5.0|Ofcourse the album was superb. Also amozon got it to me very fast. So I was listening to it in no time.                                 Thank you                                      Bill Thornton
B001K3JF7K|1.0|Based on my admiration of the artist and love of the chosen songs, I reserved this album prior to its release.  Big mistake.  I don't like the new molases voice or elevator music quality of the background.  A few cuts are okay, but most of the time I wasn't sure whom I was listening to.  Where is the cutting snappy jazzy iconic voice and piano playing that is uniquely Diana?  I'm still a fan and will still purchase future albums, but I will preview them first.
B001UREJWM|5.0|HELL IS HERE,AWESOME DISC,10 TRAX OF THE BEST METAL    I GOT A FREE T-SHIRT & POSTER WHEN I BOUGHT CD AT A LOCAL MUSIC STORE
B0000DYKET|5.0|I can't add much more praise than the other reviewers.  They are all spot on.  I've owned a pair of Newport's for 3 years.  They're still going strong & look almost new.  Best sandals ever.
B001ILHY1I|4.0|The movie was action packed with no boring story line.  Right on point as the movie starts.  In my opinion, this movie will and is a collection item.  The females were hott in this movie.
B00005LC1H|5.0|I bought this for my brother for Christmas. We're both fans of the show and we watched each episode right away. Each one is hilarious! Honestly, they're all great. Too bad they only did a dozen episodes.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I've been a huge Nathan Fillion fan for years and was so excited to hear he was going to be on TV again.  CASTLE has lived up to all my expectations and more.  I wasn't familiar with Stana Katic before this, but their characters have great chemistry and she is the perfect pairing with Nathan.  If you are a fan of Nathan, definitely check out this show.  If you are a fan of sardonic wit, this is the show for you!!
B001UREJWM|4.0|I admit I was very excited to pick up this album and the first two spins I wasn't sure if this was a classic or a dud however listening to it again I realize how much I do like this album. Considering some of the material I hear today and Sabbaths long and very influential career this is worth picking up for the hardcore and casual Sabbath fans. I don't find it weak and considering these guys are well up there in age with Dio turning 68 this year he still has his range and folks these guys still rock!!! There's Sabbath with Ozzy which I enjoy very much and then there's the era with Dio which also has given us some classics and I think you can add this release to that list.
B0016OMFNY|5.0|This is a great collection of songs by very great artists. If you like the golden music, you will love this!
B001DDBCUU|5.0|I absolutley love this movie! Ive seen almost every episode of the actual show so the movie is exciting to have! \\"The fabulous fashion of sex and the city\\" is my favorite special feautre. Both videos (Extended Cut & The Movie) were in great conditions. I can't complain about anything.
B000X5SPBI|4.0|I'm really not into anything that scares me in the movie or tv region...but my roommate introduced me to this show last September and I absolutely fell in love with it!! I LOVE Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles...they're both amazing and make this show the greatest thing ever!! I've even reached out and got some of my friends that weren't fans before and made them fans by letting them watch it!  The third season is such a trip! Watching Dean's journey through his last year is both funny and tugs at your heart strings a little watching them fight to save him!  The only thing better than this season...is the one after it! But that's not exactly out to own yet...so we'll just have to be patient. :)    I would seriously recommend this to ANYONE (actually I DO recommend this to everyone I know, pretty much)...especially if they don't mind watching somethin that scares them once in a while...and even if they don't like scary stuff...it's worth it for Sam and Dean Winchester :D
B001K3JF7K|3.0|What sets Diana apart from those in her genre on previous outings is her unique voice, great jazz intonations and the ability to add tasteful improvisations to even the blandest of standards. This album lives up to it's title track in every way but even those desiring a musical quiet night look forward to an occasional mood change to keep things real. This album does not stray far from it's quiet mood and, but for her sultry, excessively breathy renditions, it possesses little else in Krall-esque quality.  This is an overall good outing for the likes of lesser known, lesser talented artists a la Norah Jones, Jane Monheit and their ilk.  But Diana's previous work strongly suggests hers is a talent that is anything but ordinary which, sadly, was not served well on this album. We die-hard Krall-ers now must await a fresh compilation probably called \\"The Morning After...\\" now that some producer's dream of a \\"Quiet Night\\" has ended!
B001UEBHYS|3.0|This was not a bad movie. The kids were great. I don't what it is that keeps me from saying the movie was great. I mean, there were great moments here and there, but I actually watched this movie in bits and pieces. I found myself needing a break now and then. Yeah, and of course it was a bit contrived, but the thing is it felt contrived. But still, it was not bad. The soundtrack is awesome.
0385732554|4.0|This is a great book in the sense that it really makes you question what you don't know.  The book is focused around a 12 year old boy who lives in an ideal community.  At first you think it is so well organized and almost a true Utopia but then as we learn more about the true surroundings and see Jonas's world from the new perspective of the Giver.  Jonas's new mentor and teacher.  Little things like how words play into our everyday life.  How in this community exact truth and meaning of a word is a form of control over the individual.  In this community the individuals must be exact so the community remains controlled and safe.  Where the Community can use words like elsewhere and release to be vague to the individual.  At first you see it as ideal living but then it clearly becomes an ideal existence.  To live is to experience and to be an individual and this book explores that  in an amazing way.  The ending is a surprise and truly is up to the reader how to interpret it.  Young and old will enjoy this book and great for a family discussion.  '
B00003CXCQ|5.0|I received this DVD fast and it was in great shape, just like it said.  My daughter really has enjoyed it.  Thanks!

B001K3JF7K|5.0|Excellent CD we are big fans of Diana Krall.  We have many of her CDs.  If you like soft jazz then you will enjoy this CD.
B00006G8G1|1.0|Harris takes a great concert and manages to destroy it with the most hyperactive editing I've ever seen.    Normally when watching things I never even think about the editing.  Editing is something you shouldn't think about when it's done right.  You shouldn't notice it.  You only notice it when it bad, and it's really bad here.  I think that had 24 cameras and Harris seems to be of the philosophy that you must show a shot from each of them within every minute.  He can't do something wild & crazy thing like focus on Bruce while Bruce is singing.  He has to randomly jump around from one shot to another to another to another to another to another to another to another to another to another to another to drive a viewer to the brink of total insanity.    All I wanted to do was strangle Harris as I watched it.
0810979772|5.0|My grandson, age 8, loves these stories.  We have had trouble getting him to want to read.  Once he read one of the Wimpy kid books, he wanted them all.  I want him to like reading, so I bought all of them. Neither of us was dissapointed.
B00127RAJY|4.0|This is a great product as long as you actually use it.   The exercises are not difficult but somehow the combonation is extremely effective. I'd definately pick it up. The price is good too!
B00026L7O0|5.0|The product was wonderful, as always. We always get good movies from Amazon.com, and their sellers. We won't go anywhere else.
B00127RAJY|5.0|OMG! If you are looking to get in shape FAST this will do it. I can only say I can see why people on the biggest loser all lose so much weight with Jillian. This was a killer workout. I had a baby and needed to lose the last 10 pounds that slowly became 20! This has jumpstarted that quickly! I would recommend that if you are just getting started again to exercise you start on level one and take it easy. Now that I done this I am back to running and weight lifting. What an improvement it has made for me.
0307450570|5.0|Excellent 'meaty' book. All these crafts are on her website, though. The book is beautiful.  The book is very afordable.  This is a good reference book for your craft library.
0545128285|4.0|Got this for my son who is a potter fan. Although not a potter book makes it a fun read.
0756405890|2.0|After hearing so much positive feedback on the book I was eager to read the work, but after the first 300 pages or so was disappointed to find that it was going no where. Needless to say the next slow 400 pages were simply to finish the story to its end, hoping it would redeem itself.
B001NY42KQ|5.0|This movie is so much better than the first two-- the story is great, the singing and dancing are better than ever-- and the overall quality of the film is easy to see.  Love the extras!
B000MRAAJM|4.0|Are they kidding?  How can BBC justify issuing a BD set with none of the bonus features available on the standard-def DVDs?  I'm not usually a fan of supplemental features, but these were very interesting and their absence is significant.<br /><br />On the plus side, this is a wonderful and amazing documentary series that is beautifully displayed in high-def 1080p.  Audio quality could be better, but is adequate (compressed Dolby Digital 5.1).  Definitely still worth the purchase.
B000VWE5OY|3.0|Too often an episode of Torchwood reaches its climax with Captain Jack standing in a column of irradiated light, his handsome features contorted in pain, screaming either, \\"&Ouml;pen the Rift!\\" or \\"Close the Rift!\\"  Since we never did figure out what the Rift was nor why it should be either opened or closed, we haven't yet come close to the ideal experience of Torchwood which, on the face of it, should be one of our very favorite shows.<br /><br />It has, seemingly, everything, an unusual location, a provocative theme, some passable acting, a good looking cast, and that Doctor Who pedigree.  And how many shows use anagrams in their title, so that's cool!  And yet whenever it begins, I get distracted, looking at Owen's unappealingly foxy face; the little twerp is supposed to be the sexyboy on the show, but to me he looks like a pocket version of the late Don Knotts.  Then there's Eve Myles, gorgeous and gaptoothed as Gwen.  In Season One she quits her job on the regular police force to join up with Torchwood, the secret branch.  Either they present some episodes out of order on the DVD, or Gwen forgets she's married whenever it's convenient for the writers (if she's not married to the guy at home, forgive me for not understanding the Welsh).<br /><br />Torchwood's mission, to repel aliens, seems boring after a bit.  And xenophobic and nationalistic.  Why are the aliens uniformly presented as unattractive, in fact evil freaks?  Is this how outsiders are welcomed in Cardiff?  Then excuse me if I stay home, despite the way the city skyline and marina have been photoshopped to picture postcard perfection for the filming.  As for Ianto or whatever his name is, on any other show he'd be an extra; here requiring him to memorize and say lines smacks of exploitation.<br /><br />Still we're sort of hooked and have started Season Two with hopes still high.
B001R0KH3M|5.0|Stevie is always wonderful!  Very good music selection list.  Good Quality of sound!  I highly recommend!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this workout. I am in pretty good shape, but trying to lose about 5-7 lbs before swimsuit season. I have been doing a mealplan combined with intense cardio about four days a week, and had come to a stand still in losing weight. So I decided to try Jillian's 30 Day Shred. I did it twice a week, and then my normal elliptical routine two other days out of the week. Last week I did this and lost 3 lbs when I had previously only been losing at a rate of 1 lb or less a week! You will be VERY VERY sweaty when you're done doing this workout. And I am still only doing week 1, but it is tough! Try it you will be so glad you did. I am!
B001C08RHA|3.0|There are two classes of superhero films:  top tier ones that are psychologically real (Spiderman, X-Men) or simple two-dimensional stereotypes.  Iron Man, alas, is the latter, at least for me:  they tend to over-emphasize special effects to make up for weaknesses in the script, have far more action than character development, and follow some pretty simple formulas.  I was hoping for better.<br /><br />That being said, the actors are very good, starting with Downey.  Perhaps it is that he is such a playboy genius type that turned me off, as opposed to a nerd like Peter Parker, who unexpectedly gains power.  I didn't identify with him much.  But he undergoes a pretty interesting transformation and he has nice chemistry with Paltrow, who is as luminous as ever.  Bridges isn't a bad bad guy, but he is lackluster.<br /><br />I did like the special effects and technology evocations.  When he flies through the air, it is fun and very beautiful.  His end fight is also very fun indeed, particularly as he is handicapped.<br /><br />Recommended with these caveats.
B001IBIQU6|3.0|I actually don't hate the album now that I've listened to it 3 or 4 times. But I don't rate it at 5 stars either. To me it sounds like theres something missing. Usually I can tell a new Depeche song when I first hear the opening but now I can't. Some of the music sounds vague and undefined. \\"Spacewalker\\" is awful to me and doesn't sound anything like Depeche Mode.    I do like the opening song \\"In Chains\\" along with \\"Wrong\\" and \\"Peace\\". There are a few more that are ok but not quite as catchy.    I'm sure had Alan been in the recording sessions we would have been treated to a CD with more definition and structure. I'll still play this album, but not as much as the Alan era recordings.
0743496736|4.0|I usually get inspired to read books by my mother. When she finds a really good book she tells me about it and I become interested in it so I read it. I like this way because I don't like finding books on my own. I usually find a book I do not like. I like my mom finding the books because she knows what I am interested in. Also, I like how I have someone to talk about the book with; in case I do not understand what is happening.   This book is about a school shooting telling how and why the kid did it and the others who are affected by it. It dealt with many high school issues, like teasing, dating, peer pressure, mother-daughter relationship, and more. The author used these topics through many characters associated with the shooting. Jodi Picoult showed Josie dealing with dating and Peter confronting teasing. I liked how they used high school issues because I use them as advice for what to do when I am in that situation.  I liked how the book was exciting from start to finish. The action starts right way. It was hard to put down because I would read an exciting part and tell myself to stop after it and then another exciting part comes up. I liked the many different characters point of view. I liked the cop's point of view solving the case, the judge's decision, why the shooter shot everyone, and how the victim deals with the shock. I liked how real the book was. It was cool to see what lead the kid to shoot the kids. It scared me how it could happen at my school.  I did not like the parts when there was a touching mother and daughter moment. Also, the random judge cases like a girlfriend receives a stolen necklace from her boyfriend and claims she did not know it was stolen. Those parts were boring and did not understand why she put it in the book. Otherwise, I loved the book and would recommend it.   I would recommend this book to high school students. It opens teenagers eyes to what can happen. It shows them that a school shooting can happen to their school. Shootings are a problem for schools and Nineteen Minutes is a good example of what happens in those situations. The book shows me that it is serious and that people can die.
B001NESPHC|5.0|You owe it to yourself to give this a listen or two and I promise you that you would be deep in love before you even know it! A real legend was born with her 1st album and the saga continues with more soul and heart. An unbelievably talented musician, who makes music from deep in her heart. Some caliber that are very rare these days! Get it now or you will regret it that you did not discover this rare gem earlier! Enjoy the Music!!!
B001UREJWM|2.0|There comes a time in the career of almost every band or artist when someone else can steer the musical reins more successfully than the musicians themselves. Think Robert Plant and Jimmy Page's \\"Walking to Clarksdale.\\" Imagine if Dave Grohl or Lenny Kravitz had produced it. People may have actually bought it -- and might even be able to name or hum one or two tracks 14 years later.    This is exactly the situation with \\"The Devil You Know\\" -- the new release from the touring version of Black Sabbath, now known as Heaven & Hell. Seventeen years in the making, this is an album created by four very talented and accomplished musicians whose past, together and apart, includes some of the most memorable tunes in the hard rock arena. Who can forget Ronnie James Dio's contributions to Rainbow, like \\"Man on the Silver Mountain,\\" \\"Gates of Babylon\\" and \\"Long Live Rock & Roll?\\" And Iommi and Butler practically wrote the book on hard rock as Black Sabbath (with Ozzy Osbourne) with songs like \\"Iron Man,\\" \\"Paranoid\\" and \\"Black Sabbath.\\"     Together, as Black Sabbath #2, these particular gentlemen created rock classics in the mid 1980s like \\"Neon Nights,\\" \\"Die Young\\" and \\"Heaven & Hell.\\" Expectations may have been high, but sadly, none of the music on this 2009 release comes close to the numbers of the past. Instead, we get 10 droning songs of drudgery that follow a predictable formula, leaving us hoping with each tune that the next one will stand out. But it never does.    Listening to this album, one can only imagine what a visionary producer would have done with these artists and these songs. Maybe instead of each tune following the same progression of riff, followed by the \\"chug-chug-chug-chug\\" of a chord while Dio rants about his typical netherworld subject matter (spiders, Satan, angels, etc.), they could have actually crafted real songs that make melody a priority, offer exciting textures and rhythms and are memorable, unique from each other and relevant in today's musical landscape.    It's not like these guys haven't done just that many times before. Listen to the albums \\"Heaven & Hell\\" and \\"The Mob Rules\\" and you'll hear unique tunes that are exciting, memorable and different from each other. But just as Dio's later albums fell into the formula of the chugging guitar chord (think the verses of \\"Holy Diver\\") - without melody or texture - and just as this group's 1992 release \\"Dehumanizer\\" offered the same lack of originality (except for maybe \\"I\\" and \\"Computer God\\") this album, too, boats mid-tempo warbler after mid-tempo warbler with lyrics almost as ridiculous as the album cover.     By the way, do grown men or women really buy albums with this type of teenage monster angst art on them? What happened to the clever artwork of the original \\"Heaven & Hell\\" album? Besides a producer, these guys could use an art director with a foot in the modern world. Sorry, but album covers like this get laughed at - they don't sell.    All in all, \\"The Devil You Know\\" is four terrific musicians attempting to maintain control long past their prime by producing themselves - from the music to the artwork - while lacking any sense of what made them successful in the past or what is relevant in the here and now. They could have returned to the spotlight - the Guitar Hero generation is hungry for great new music. But instead, they've only muddied their legacy. Maybe they'll give us one more album - overseen by a great producer who can conjure from these guys the magical songs and sounds that they're capable of.    Until then, on and on, on and on, it's heaven and hell.

This copy I bought as a gift for a 16 year old grandchild, who loves to read, because its theme is about the treasure and mystery of books themselves.

0671027344|3.0|I don't think teenagers should be encouraged to read this. Experimenting with drugs. Gay lifestyles. Underage sex. Dealing with death badly. Giving in to peer pressure. Basically everything you don't want a teenager to get confused about. This book is a sympathic view to teenagers making bad decisions and acting badly.    But it's well written and interesting. So I give it 3 stars. It has a certain realism that many adults could relate to. It steers into directions that would never happen in real life too. Like older teenagers accepting younger teenagers into their cliches. That almost never happens. Teenagers tend to be very status conscious at this age. And boys don't cry. He would be hounded relentessly for displaying these weaknesses. Reality is much more poignant for teenagers.

B001676320|1.0|After reading the reviews for this concert, I thought it would be an excellent addition to my library. I have many concerts that I view frequently that are both great concerts and have been expertly edited for both video and sound. I was looking for another high quality, BluRay concert that would be a good demo for my home theater system. Being a Chicago fan from their beginning only made it that much more enticing. Unfortunately, I was disappointed with the voices. I appreciate that various members have changed but the replacements weren't very good. Weak voices trying to put their own spin on the vocals was distracting. I guess my hope was to hear a recreation of the groups of old rather than an odd reincarnation. One of the comments at the beginning of the disc was that this was their third night in LA and this concert was being taped.I ended up fast forwarding through many of the songs. I think they were tired and voices were stressed. There were a few good pieces with great instrumental sections that did evoke the groups of old. I regret having purchased this disc.
B000I0RNV6|5.0|Cinema Paradiso is one of those rare motion pictures that says something remarkably meaningful and it truly succeeds by any measure. The acting is very convincing and the plot moves along at a good pace although there is plenty of outstanding and insightful character development. The choreography and cinematography couldn't be any better; and this film easily deserved the Oscar it won for Best Foreign Film.<br /><br />When the action starts, we meet young Salvatore \\"Toto\\" Di Vita (Salvatore Cascio) who is constantly annoying his mother Maria (Antonella Attili) by hanging out at the village movie theater where he tries time and again to befriend the somewhat cranky middle aged projectionist Alfredo (Philippe Noiret). Alfredo finally lets young Toto routinely into the projectionist booth and Toto proves to be a quick study of the projection machinery. Toto's love for films and their village cinema in particular only grows with time. Tragedy strikes, unfortunately, when Alfredo is injured and blinded by a fire in the projectionist booth; and it isn't long before young Toto is given the responsibility of showing at least most of the films.<br /><br />The film eventually jumps to Salvatore's entry into manhood from adolescence; he (now played by Marco Leonardi) works at the cinema and he falls deeply in love with a beautiful young woman named Elena (Agnese Nano). Salvatore tries so hard to get Elena to love him in return; and just when she truly does love him her parents whisk her away so that she could never marry Salvatore. It's also at about this time that Salvatore has to do a stint in the Italian military and when he returns to his village he finds his treasured job lost to a total stranger. Alfredo believes in Salvatore and tells him not to worry about Elena, the theater and their village. Alfredo wants Salvatore to go into big business, perhaps in film, and forget all about their village and his life up to this point.<br /><br />Salvatore does go away--for thirty years. And from here the plot can go anywhere. Why does Salvatore (now played by Jacques Perrin) return--and why did he stay away for thirty years? Did he ever try to find Elena during all these years? How has his village changed over time? No plot spoilers here, folks! The last hour of the movie remains a secret. Watch the film and find out!<br /><br />I'm honestly shocked that purely for the sake of making the film shorter they actually cut this film by roughly fifty minutes when it was first released; people seeing this film at that time did not have any more of the story regarding Salvatore and Elena. That's a terrible shame; the movie is so much stronger with the extra footage. It comes in at roughly two hours and fifty-five minutes; but it's well worth your time. They rarely make films as meaningful and touching as Cinema Paradiso. We also get more footage of Salvatore's time in the Italian military; and that's a plus, too.<br /><br />Cinema Paradiso is like a supercharged jet that taxis down the runway, lifts upward and takes off with incredible power! You may want to have a box of tissues at your side especially during the last hour of the movie--it's quite a tearjerker--and I never tear up at movies! This is easily one of the best foreign films you'll ever see; and movie buffs everywhere are encouraged to get this and enjoy it over and over again.he plot can go anywhere.

0786852550|4.0|I greatly enjoyed reading the Amulet of Samarkand, even though it was a different sort of fantasy than my usual reading material and the setting took some getting used to.  Firstly, we do have a young magician lad in a coming of age story, but many factors are flipped on their heads. Nathaniel is not a hero, but rather an anti-hero; a cold, amoral, power-hungry, vindictive, vengeful brat of an anti-hero...And that's how I like my fantasy heroes. His character was just so interesting.  The other protagonist is Bartimaeus, a spirtual entity called a Djinni who has been bound to serve Nathaniel by powerful magic. His chapters are told in the first-person, with lots of witty commentary, sarcastic humor, and footnotes detailing extra thoughts he's having during the action. If you like a dash of acidic mockery that cuts to the bone and other wit, you'll be constantly entertained.  What else? The plot was good, given a fairly good premise and ending with a battle. I can't recall being bored and wishing the story would pick up. The characters were great, the dialogue was great, the action was great, the narrative was great, etc.   However, there were a few iffy issues I had with this book, like the magic system. Is it ever explained how it works? Not very clearly. It seems to rely chiefly on summoning spirits of various powers and using them as servants, though there are small enchantments that can be performed by hand, such as Detonations or Inferno. I would have liked more explanation about magic (which wouldn't have been hard given all the time Nat spends learning about it offscreen), and less reliance on summoning.  Also, the order of the chapters can get a little confusing. They aren't in chronological order. It starts in the heat of the action, and then the chapters switch between the Bartimaeus chapters that continue in the present, and chapters from the past that give the backstory on Nathaniel, and that trend continues until the entire backstory is told and the twonarratives meet. The switching between first person and third person is also a little strange. While a seasoned reader probably won't be confused, it might be inconvenient to the casual one.  In conclusion, this rather gritty reverse of Harry Potter is an excellent read, definitely recommended, especially to those who like variants on common fantasy elements, with more morally ambiguous characters.
B000001DZM|5.0|A great movie with an interesting plot. It has it's up beat moments and it's very dark side just as life can sometimes have. I think a lot of us can identify with some of the charactors. A must for any gay man to see.
B001FB55MG|5.0|Our family loved watching this movie together, and the kids have watched it several times since our purchase of it.  So glad we bought this dvd!
B001ED7C58|5.0|would almost agree with steph's review (nov,2008). quite the analytical critic. two thumbs-up for steph.
B001TK3XO0|3.0|The book was very well written and certainly the story was absorbing.   Personally I am tired of books about this area but my book club chose it so I ordered it.   I'm ready to read about some Caucasians myself.
B001AGXEAG|5.0|I can't comment on the controversy here regarding certain parts being cut out of this new release. All I can say is that this is a great movie, completely entertaining and genius on many levels. It's also something your whole family can enjoy generation after generation. If you've never seen this, or haven't seen it in a while, check it out. It will put a smile on your face.
031606792X|1.0|I first picked up this series as a gift for my 18 year old niece.  She encouraged me to read them too and I enjoyed the first three books. While I can understand the dismay some feel over Bella's dependence I enjoyed the lack of foul language and the 'family sticks together' theme.    ***Spoilers***  But this book was just bad.  I would have rather she had stopped after the wedding.  Half vampire baby? ugh.  So it's ok for the vamps to be around her when she is menstruating (Alice packs tampons for honeymoon)  but god forbid she cuts her finger <from the earlier book>.    Lets solve the Jacob triangle by having him imprint.. their baby.  Come on that's pathetic.  He cannot handle the issue with Bella giving up her humanity for Edward, so let's force him on her half human half vamp baby and everything is ok.  Leah Clearwater would have been a better resolution, or heck Jessica or Angela.    Bah, the rest is just as convoluted.  There were some nice points, but the final resolution was just.. boring.
B001TH16DS|5.0|I've seen every one of these episodes dozens of times, but watching the remastered versions was like a whole new experience. The colors are now so vibrant and saturated (but not overly so). The cheesiness of the sets and props are much more evident with the level of detail in this format, but it just adds to the charm of the series. You can now see that the control panel on Kirk's chair is just a bejeweled piece of plastic that blinks.<br /><br />The new special effects are interesting, and certainly a big improvement over the old effects, but I got the feeling that they were done cheaply. They just don't attain the quality of the 'Enterprise' series. Still fun to watch though.<br /><br />The extras are well done and have some interesting comments from some of the folks who worked on the original series as well as those who worked on the remastering. So far, I haven't seen any appearances from regular cast members.<br /><br />I was a little bummed that 'The Cage' was not included with the first season set and will instead be a part of season three.<br /><br />All in all though, this is a must have for Star Trek fans who have a blu ray player. I know I'll be spending every evening for the next several months watching these.
0765348276|5.0|Old Man's War is modern science fiction at its best.  In a time where the greatest writers are focusing on pumping out massive space operas with intricate plot lines and thousands of pages of content, John Scalzi gets back to the basics.  The protagonist John Perry has nothing more to live for and gets whisked away into an adventure he never thought possible.  He goes from an insignificant citizen of Earth to a key figure in the fight for humanity's very existence in a universe full of dangerous aliens and perilous worlds.  Scalzi paints an incredible universe that keeps the reader intrigued with a plot that is briskly developed and quick witted dialog.  I found myself rooting for Perry the entire story actually feeling for him during certain situations.<br /><br />If you are a fan of science fiction or a fan of adventure at all, give this book a read.
B00024I2Z4|4.0|Although this movie is not as good as some of its predecessors (such as the Lion King, Beauty and the Beast, etc.) it is still very enjoyable.
B000F3T3CS|5.0|I have watched this opera twice since I bought it. I have recomended it to my friends. It was wonderful.
B000GFLEJA|1.0|Great HD DVD, but this movie was a waste of time! Sorry, just don't care for it.
B001GCUO1G|4.0|1840's Canada, two boys are together.  They are Logan (later Wolverine) and Victor Creed (later Sabretooth).  When they lose their father, they go off together to fight.  They're both mutants and virtually indestructible.    Present day and the pair has fought in almost every war since then.  Col. William Stryker recruits them for an elite strike force.  When Logan realizes Stryker's ultimate plans, he opts out and moves to the Canadian Rockies and marries schoolteacher, Kayla.     But, the fight's not over.  Sabretooth is going after the former team and Wolverine's got to step up before they're all killed.     Fandom of \\"Wolverine Origins\\" seems to be currently divided between two camps:  those who read the dark character in the Marvel comic books and those who have not. For the record, I have not read the comics--only seen the movies.  That being said, I enjoyed watching \\"X-men Origins.\\" I cannot speak to the story's authenticity to its source material, but I can say the action was interesting, the scenery spectacular, and it was 2 hours well spent in the theatre.      Easter Egg Alert: Stay until the very end of the film.  There is an Easter Egg.     Rebecca Kyle, April 2009
1416511946|5.0|The Heroine Diaries was an amazing book.  During school, me and one of my friends were talking about music that we liked.  After awhile I brought up the band motley crue and when I brought them up my friend wondered if I have read the book Heroine Diaries and told him that I have not.  He said that it was a really good book, and that I should read it, and I'm glad that I did.      This book is made up of several journal entries that motley crue's bassist Nikki Sixx had written.  He writes about his obsession with drugs, how it has affected himself, his career, his friends, and even his family.  He writes when he is affected and not affected by drugs, so that when he looks back, he can see the difference between his entries.    This book was like no other book that I have read before.  The book was not just words on paper, but there was drawings and pictures and creative backgrounds and was very colorful.  I also enjoyed that the book was very truthful, after entries there are quotes from people that were close to Nikki, and they would give a reaction to what's said.  But the most important part is that when Nikki asked people to give a reaction to his journals, he wanted them to not hold back, to give him all they got and say what they truly feel.      In the end, it was an extremely good book, allot better then I expected.  I would suggest this book to anyone that wants a very good look at what it is like to have an addiction to drugs, and not be able to stop.  This book I believe is one of the closest things to the real thing, see, feel, and live without the effect.  I also suggest this book to people that like to toy and mess with drugs for fun.  This book I hope would let them see that drugs are no were near fun or enjoyable and hopefully would straighten them back onto a life without drugs.    Even though this book should be read by many people, there are some I believe should not read it.  Younger kids should not read this, because there is allot of language and graphic images that could be offensive to some, but also can scar others for life.  I also suggest that people who are very emotionally affected, or easily offended should not read this book.  This book like I said before is very graphic, there are images that many can find offensive, and can also be a very heart wrenching and difficult read.  I would like to see everyone read this book, but not if they would be severely affected for reading it.
B000059Z8J|5.0|Man, time flies........not just Superman.  I say that because I vividly remember when this movie came out in the theater and the excitement it caused. This was the first Superman anyone had ever seen with modern-day special effects, and I on the big screen, so it was pretty cool, to say the least.  Now,     It's still very entertaining, and the more I watch this the more I'm amused with the villain (Gene Hackman as \\"Lex Luthor\\") and the lines he delivers. He's a funny guy. Christopher Reeve, meanwhile, was always a popular \\"Man Of Steel\\" and the special effects are still fun to watch, from the long opening scenes showing the end of the planet Kryton all the way to the ending credits. There's a solid soundtrack to this, too.    Personally, I never cared for Margot Kidder as Lois Lane but then again, Lane's character in the 1950s TV series was a bit annoying, too. I guess it comes with the territory.   However, being a kid growing up with that series with all its innocence it was just too weird watching this movie and  hearing Lois ask Superman what color her panties were!  (The purity of the  `50s is lone gone!)    Whatever, this is still great entertainment. As a superhero, Superman has always been THE MAN. Three sequels followed this film, the second one being the best in my opinion.
B00127RAJY|5.0|i love this workout. it doesn't just focus in one area, but gives you an all body workout.
0061373877|4.0|An engrossing tale with unexpected twists and an outstanding array of offbeat characters, locales, and suspense.  Kroop and Vandimar were truly disgusting--and frightening--villians that had the flavor of two gay villians in an old Roger Moore Bond film.  The audio book was expertly read by the author, and the ending was satisfying.
0671042858|5.0|I absolutely LOVE this book. I first read it while in the 6th grade. It is unforgettable. This book has everything: horror, suspense, thrills, hope... Stephen King really out did himself. I did not put this book down until I had finished, all the while imagining it was myself in the story. A must read!!! Pure genious!!
B000T06172|5.0|This really is one of the great albums ever, and the remastered sound is very good. The only big difference between this MP3 version and the two-disc set of the same recordings is that the set gives you a DVD with a \\"making-of\\" documentary and both the original mono mixes and new stereo mixes, plus a bonus track. This MP3 set has only the remastered stereo mixes.<br /><br />\\"Pet Sounds\\" was a groundbreaking record, and had a huge impact on other musicians. It is definitely the high-water mark for the Beach Boys. This is not anything like their early Jan & Dean-inspired surf music. It invented a whole new vocabulary of sounds and forms for pop music.<br /><br />More than ever before, the Beach Boys' leader, Brian Wilson, decided he was going to go in a new direction and write a cohesive album, over the protests of many others in the band. He was definitely right. The Beach Boys never reached this level of creativity again, but \\"Pet Sounds\\" was enough to put them in the pantheon of the greats, even if this quality of artistic achievement was not sustained over time.<br /><br />Wilson says he was inspired to make the record by the Beatles' \\"Rubber Soul\\" album. The Beatles in turn credited \\"Pet Sounds\\" as the inspiration for \\"Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\". Paul McCartney still says he is crazy about the album, John Lennon even acknowledged it, and George Martin said Sgt Pepper's would never have been made without \\"Pet Sounds\\". Eric Clapton says it's one of the greatest pop albums of all time and Elton John talks about how it changed the way he and everyone else approached recording. I say this just to underline that it's hard to underestimate the impact this record had on the development of popular music as we know it.<br /><br />There are plenty of \\"greatest hits\\" here. The album starts out with the classic \\"Wouldn't It Be Nice\\", one of the most optimistic and upbeat romantic pop hits ever -- and which also includes incredible layers of sound that deserve a good listening to with headphones. \\"God Only Knows\\" was the B-side to that single, but became a major hit on its own. \\"Caroline, No\\", \\"Sloop John B\\", \\"Let's Go Away for a While\\" and \\"Here Today\\" were also singles and are probably known at some level by most listeners.<br /><br />But don't just get it for the hits. A lot of the other songs are slower and more complex, but are really marvels of both pop composition and sound engineering, especially when you think about the 1960s technology they were working with. There are layers upon layers of crystal-clear sounds to enjoy and get lost in.<br /><br />This album is every bit as impressive a recording as something like Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" -- it just seems \\"lighter\\" because, well, it is. It's an optimistic, feel-good record even when its gets sad and melancholy, which it does pretty often. I still can't figure out quite how Brian Wilson pulled that off.<br /><br />If you don't know Pet Sounds, this deal can't be beat, especially at the $1.99 \\"Deal of the Day\\" price on May 1, 2009. Once the price goes up again, also consider one of the CDs or CD sets available out there. You won't regret it!. \\"God Only Knows\\" was the B-side to that single, but became a major hit on its own. \\"Caroline, No\\", \\"Sloop John B\\", \\"Let's Go Away for a While\\" and \\"Here Today\\" were also singles and are probably known at some level by most listeners.

B00004VW35|5.0|I received a copy of \\"Old Ways,\\" for Christmas during my Neil Young phase, when I was a teenager.  And in my move out of my parents' house I sadly lost it.  Fortunately, several years ago, I was able to buy a replacement copy.  And I have it on my iPod.  It has some GREAT numbers on it.  A lot of the songs are ones that Neil Young wrote, but there are also ones that are classics.  For example, everybody knows \\"The Wayward Wind.\\"  And \\"Any More Real Cowboys,\\" is also pretty popular.  \\"My Boy,\\" makes me cry every time I hear that cut.    If all you care about it Neil Young's rock music, this may not be the right choice for you.  However, if you are a big fan of Neil Young, period.  Then by all means buy yourself a copy of this first rate CD.  You'll be glad you did!
B001R0KH3W|5.0|Stevie and I are the same age, and I remember exactly what I was doing when I first heard 12 year old Little Stevie Wonder' hit Fingertips Part 1 & 2 on my battery powered AM radio, strapped to my paperboy bicycle. That was the summer of 1962, and I've been a fan ever since. This blu-ray is fantastic! Stevie's 14 piece band will floor you as he winds you through a musical odysey of his career. Run, don't walk to the music store. It's that good!

B000LP6KSU|5.0|I am a huge fan of MCR, and I do not buy edited versions, but for a birthday gift for a friend's child, I found it to be perfect. She could still enjoy this great CD without me offending any parents.
B0006AAS5G|5.0|My only complaints are the manual and the 'chronograph' feature. I also didn't know before ordering that the small hour dial was not part of the chronograph. Instead, the hour dial just reiterates the hour of the day. The manual did more harm than good for helping me set the watch. Here's a more concise explanation:    Crown and buttons are screw down, first unscrew fully.  Crown out to the mid-way position to adjust date, fully out to adjust time.  In the 'time' position, the top button will zero the second hand for the chronograph feature. The bottom button does nothing, or so I think. (I am not sure how to adjust the minute dial, but mine was zeroed to begin with.)  Screw back down crown and buttons.    Completely disregard the manual. It states you can use the bottom button to switch between adjusting the dials. This was not the case.    The crown has a tendency to rub against the back of my hand at times. Otherwise, the watch fits decently. It's rather lightweight and it looks great.
B0000524CY|5.0|OMG, the scene where the crawls up the stairs like a crab gives me chills everytime I think about it... good...scary... what else you want? Maybe a nice \\"flaming\\" raspberry tea like Nate Iseminger?
B000H5TVKI|2.0|Believe it or not, I had never actually this before (or any of the Rambo movies). Didn't do much for me - the directing and editing seem pretty dated, and I never felt much sympathy for the lead character. Not as awful as I thought it might be, not as good as I had hoped.
B000H5U832|5.0|Don't hesitate to buy this one; you'll like it almost as much as Chuck \\"I'm a private pilot myself\\" Spratt loves a sheep on a saturday night...<br /><br />...hATCh - \\"You can trust me, I'm an air traffic controller\\"...
B001EOQWF8|5.0|Best movie of 2008, in my opinion! An instant classic, with great animation, storytelling with great depth, and \\"acting\\" that's better than most real people achieve!
B0002KQNJU|5.0|Put this movie on with your girl or your favorite pillow & see the amazing scenery (filmed on location in Europe, but think Transylvania) and sound. My favorite scene is in the beginning when they are on the sleigh & the wolves are coming after them. The bells, the howling... you can almost feel as though you are there. This movie is both scary AND funny, so you can't go wrong... unless your name is Fhat Boxx & only watch Erik Estrada flicks whilst simultaneously sitting around in your furry thong, wearing a welder's mask & holding a Mr. Destroyer Deluxe with the kung-fu grip...<br /><br />...hATCh<br /><br />\\"You can trust me, I'm an air traffic controller\\"...
B001DHXT1G|3.0|Starring Ed Norton, who I almost always like to watch. This wasn't as bad as I thought, but it certainly wasn't that great either. Good airplane movie or if you're stuck in a hotel and don't want to think too much.
031606792X|5.0|the book creates a wonderful ending the the twilight saga. i enjoyed every bit of the book.
B001PPLIFU|4.0|Not quite up to the level of 'Casino Royale', but Daniel Craig continues to impress as 007. Bond Girl Olga Kurylenko is pretty disappointing (of course she's attractive, but she's not nearly the actress that Eva Green or Halle Berry are, and they are the new standard). Still, plenty of good action, and as I already mentioned, Craig continues to impress.
0670020745|5.0|I borrowed a copy from our library based upon a recommendation and read it, all the while thinking of a friend who had a stroke about 16 months ago.  This gave me a great opportunity to talk with him about his experiences, discussions I could not have had if I didn't read Taylor's book.<br /><br />Taylor honestly shared what the stroke experience felt like (from denial to \\"Wow, this is so cool\\") and then what she went through during her 8-year recovery.  She told of what was beneficial to her during that recovery period and what sapped her energy and she needed to avoid.<br /><br />She was strong enough to tell those people who drained her to limit their visits.  She also had a gatekeeper, her Mom, who helped enforce those decisions.<br /><br />Taylor needed and received encouragement from others and I thought that maybe my friend needed something similar.  When we talked I was taken aback when he shared that his stroke experience made him think of suicide.  Wow.  We had a great conversation after that revelation.<br /><br />From Taylor I remembered that it is most important to focus on the improvements one makes during the recovery and not dwell on what was temporarily lost.<br /><br />I think this is a great book to prepare anyone to care for a person who has suffered a stroke.  One word of advice: if scientific explanations slow you down (or even bring you to a complete stop) feel free to skip the second and third chapter until you read the rest of the book.  In the past I used to enjoy delving into those explanations but this time I didn't want to lose the narrative so I skipped that part, finished the book and then went back and read those two chapters.  I understood them better in that context and didn't feel that I missed anything by delaying it.<br /><br />I will recommend this to many of my friends to help them be aware of strokes and how to minister to those who have one.
B001E75QGG|3.0|This one got pretty trashed by the critics, so maybe that lowered my expectation. But I ended up enjoying this more than I thought I would, and actually liked it better than the other two sequels - it seemed closer in spirit to the original. Sure, there were some incredibly silly parts (the fridge, the waterfalls), but it moved along quickly enough that I didn't get bogged down in the inanity. Plus the appearance of Karen Allen helped pick things up immensely.
B0000042MY|4.0|I liked the soundtrack of 'Last of the Mohegans' I checked out of Schaumburg library better than the version I bought from you.  I had no idea soundtracks can vary.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|One of the best of 2008, this fairytale of a movie is stunning from beginning to end! Great story, great performances from the entire cast, even a wonderful soundtrack.<br /><br />(For those wondering, my #1 was 'Wall-E')
B001PPGAIA|2.0|I thought this movie had a good story.... decent acting and if they would have ended it at an hour and forty-five minutes I would have given it 4 stars.    I really didn't think there was a ton of chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman but enough to pass.    The problem with this movie is that it just kept going and going and going. It just wouldn't end until they completed, what seemed like, the same story line again and again.
B0019CB5T8|3.0|Based on a true story of a girl that dies while a priest is performing an exorcism. Was it abuse? Was it a natural death? The always reliable Laura Linney stars as the high-powered lawyer who is defending the priest, nicely played by Tom Wilkinson. The movie's namesake is harrowingly played by Jennifer Carpenter, whom I only new from her role on Dexter (as his sister). She turns in a very strong performance here, showing a different side than her turn as Deb Morgan. The movie overall is pretty good, but I'm always a little cynical, and a big part of me wonders how closely this follows the facts of the true story. But regardless of the truth, the film does raise some interesting questions about the place where religion and law intersect, such as where does belief end, and psychosis begin? Hmmm...
B001HUZYKI|5.0|A bad fall destroys Joe Simpson's knee near the top of a very difficult mountain in the Huayhuash range of central Peru. The story that follows describes an incredible will to survive against ever increasing odds. The total intensity of the situation is reflected by a writing style that I found compelling. The book made me feel like I was sharing his ordeal, and I stayed up most of a night to finish it.[[ASIN:0964539993 Dancing on the Edge of an Endangered Planet]]
B001KW0C96|2.0|This one was just a weak as all the reviews had mentioned. How the hell could you waste the talents of Pacino and DeNiro with such mediocrity? Not awful, but awfully disappointing.
B00280GDFQ|5.0|Loved it and more. Not one second from beginning through the end is boring, what a story!    This was a reminder to me and would be an eye opener for some of conditions children suffer from horrors of physical, emotional and sexual abuses. Millions are uncared for, unprotected, no rights, trapped in miserable lives, prisoners of the merciless and greedy for profit.    I think many would appreciate this movie and find that it was worth every minute of their time. This is my first opinion expressed in hope that the writers, actors, producers and all who deserve credit are rewarded with success beyond expectations.      Most of all I hope somehow this vicious corruption and abuse can someday be reduced by those powerful enough to affect change. The setting is India but millions of children around the world live this way and worse.      Thank you.
B001E5FYS8|5.0|I sort of remember this feat as a child, and even back then it totally captured my imagination. This wonderful documentary recounts the months and days leading up to Petit's amazing walk between the twin towers. Plays out almost like a heist movie, but instead of stealing money, they're performing an incredible work of art. Wonderfully evokes the magic that I felt even as a boy.
B0012GMUOU|3.0|I was generally pleased with the product. However it was a bit different genre than I expected from Jeff Beck.
B001BPJJ82|4.0|Amazing movie to watch, if just for the cinematography! And I read afterward that it was all done without computer-generated effects. Huh??? Holy crap! It's a shame the overall movie isn't as strong as the visuals - I really like Lee Pace in 'Pushing Daisies' (one of my favorite TV shows), but here he is only adequate. Actually, the best acting goes to the little girl, who is a complete newcomer! 5 stars for the visuals, 3 stars for the movie, 4-stars overall.

078401213X|4.0|1998 film that I recently re-watched. I remember being more impressed the first time I saw it. I think the style of film-making was groundbreaking at the time, but now it seems a little more annoying than interesting. Still, an intriguing story and well acted.
1582701709|3.0|Having read the book a year ago, I have to admit that it is not fresh in my head, but I continued to think about it and it has prompted me to write a review.  I believe that the general priniciples of the Secret and the Law of Attraction can not be discharded as nonsense which says a lot in my opinion - it is certainly filled with earth shattering concepts.  I believe that there is something to it but its understanding is elusive and not condusive to mass media or over simplification which is why the book ultimately falls short in my opinion.  It was written to sell books, you can't blame the author for that, and it has, but the message lost something in the process.  I am confused.  The book stradled many purposes...self help, self knowledge, universal knowledge, metaphysics, pursuit of happiness, pursuit of wealth, etc.  The more it tried to be, the more the foundation of the Secret and the Law of attraction was lost.  I still don't know what \\"it\\" is.  But my opinion of its proselytizers is diminished somewhat by the commercialism of such profound concepts.  I would like a sophisticated dialogue of these principles but I am not sure that it is delivered by this book.
B001ILHY2C|3.0|Fun, turn-off-the-brain-and-enjoy movie starring Jason Stratham as a wrongfully imprisoned man, who is forced to drive in a deadly race by a sadistic warden (Joan Allen!?!?). Plot reminded me of 'The Running Man', but that didn't get in the way of the enjoying it. 3-stars to watch it once, but I probably don't ever need to see it again.

B001KVZ6F2|2.0|Disappointing tale from Clint Eastwood. Clint plays an grumpy old racist who learns to love his next door immigrants. Yeah, it's just as bad as it sounds. I have to say, I thought the first half was absolutely HILARIOUS! Clint's character was just so over-the-top, I figure it had to be camp/caricature. The way he comes up with new way to insult everyone? And goes around growling like a dog? Too funny! (And here's hoping that it was supposed to be funny, otherwise the movie's worse than I feared.) The second half of the movie really goes downhill, and becomes a kind of 'Karate Kid' in reverse (this time, the adult is American and the kid is Asian). The lone bright spot of the movie is the teenage girl who lives next door - she's a firecracker, and the movie is better every time she is on the screen. But otherwise, this is boring and predictable, something you don't usually get from Eastwood.

B000V86OKG|4.0|With 'The Wire' now retired, I think this is the best show on television at the moment. (I haven't watched 'Mad Men' yet, and it's only other competition in my mind is 'Pushing Daisies', which is a very different show.) With it's hilariously black sense of humor, this is essentially a dark comedy masquerading as a drama. Sure, there are a couple-too-many coincidences on occasion, especially towards the end of the season. But they are minor in comparison to the overall plotline, writing, and especially acting. I feel that I've gotten to know each of these characters, and their depth makes them seem completely real. And especially Michael Hall as the title character, who can go from charming to chilling within a frame. The character of Lila, introduced for this season, had some interesting moments early on, but I do feel like she hung around for too long. But on the other hand, the ongoing chase to catch the Bay Harbor Butcher, and the FBI involvement, worked great as an overall plot arc. And although it was maybe tied up a little too neatly, I still bought into it for the most part.
0316010669|3.0|Malcolm Gladwell is one of my favorite authors, but Blink is not one of my favorite books. While it poses an interesting premise, Gladwell admits in the book that he got the idea for it because of how people reacted to his wiry shock of hair when he let it grow out - that seems like a thin editorial driver.  But thin is really the focus of the book, in fact Gladwell coins the term \\"thin-slicing\\" as a key method that expert decision makers use to filter only the most important facts from an array of variables. While this is not a new idea - for decades the military has taught officers to make quick decisions with incomplete information - Gladwell takes it to an iffy extreme of making decisions in microseconds.  That may hold true in some instances but seems unsustainable as a preferred methodology of selecting among options. Regardless, it is thought provoking and worth a read. Soundview recommends the book, but leaves it up to the reader to decide its validity - hopefully you'll give it more thought than a nanosecond or a blink.
B00005JLSE|2.0|Speaking of Rene Zellweger, that just reminded me that I also recently watched this movie for the first time. Unfortunately, it did nothing for me (and I tend to actually like musicals!). I can't believe this won all those awards (Best Picture???). It looked great, and the acting was good, but I never gathered any sympathy or empathy with any of the characters, and the music itself didn't do much for me either.
B00081912E|5.0|Here is a great flick that is sure to cause boughts of laughter. It is about a short tempered, down-on-his-luck bank worker Stanley Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) whose friends with Charlie Schumaker (Richard Jeni). Little does he know that his life is about to change when he finds a mystic mask that transforms him into a wacky green-faced superhero. There is a crime wave in Edge City led by crime lord Dorian Tyrell (Peter Greene) plotting to overthrow his superior Niko (Orestes Matacena) and take over Edge City. Tyrell's former fiancè Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz) falls for Stanley while a police detective Lt. Mitch Kellaway (Peter Riegert) investigates the events of the city. Dorian tricks Peggy Brant (Amy Yasbeck) into luring Ipkiss into a trap with a prize of $50,000. Tyrell turns him in to the police from a bank robbery earlier. Ipkiss escapes from prison and convinces Kellaway to help him. Tyrell plots to use the mask to launch an attack at Niko during the charity ball at the Coco Bongo. Stanley as the Mask saves Tina, defeats Tyrell, and saves the city. The trio discard the mask into the river in the end, setting the stage for the terrible sequel, Son of the Mask. The original film was really funny and wacky. The visual effects did use a little bit of CGI, but only for the clichè cartoon antics of the film. Jim Carrey was hilarious as usual. Cameron Diaz makes her big screen debut as well. If you are looking for a funny comic book based film with Carrey, this is the real deal, but please avoid the awful sequel at all costs!
B001F7MSG6|4.0|Entertaining sueprhero flick that closely follows the footsteps of it's excellent predecessor. Good fighting sequences that are reminiscent of Chinese films like 'Hero' and 'House of Flying Daggers'. The monsters continue to look great and be inventive.

0345441184|5.0|The Mists of Avalon has changed me for good.  Bradley has given me \\"permanent Mists of Avalon on the brain\\" syndrome.  I know some of you have it....why else would you be spending your time scrolling through hundreds of reviews?      I would actually disagree with some of the people here that are defending the book against the \\"feminist stigma.\\"  It is written from a feminine perspective, but it's not just that.  There is something here that transcends the usual story-telling framework (which usually has a masculine sort of black and white quality).  Dualities of good and evil do exist in the book, but they are usually qualified somewhat.  The lead character does not condone Christianity, but she is well educated on the subject, appreciates the Merlin's wisdom as he insists that all gods are one, and in the end she submits to this thinking as well.      The author stresses the inner strengths and powers of women, and how this power should be nurtured instead of smothered.  Even Gwenhwyfar is conscious of her own womanhood, although she is sure it is sinful.  Intuition also plays a main role in the plot. Feminists might say a man's world would belittle such a quality that can't be proven by hard evidence.     But above all I have never read a book whose characters vary so drastically in their roles.  We like Arthur, hate him, love him, pity him, understand his actions, and then cannot.  The same goes for almost every character, as well as the character's relationships to each other. I loooove it. There is no set definition for anything, nothing that was learned can't be unlearned, nothing that was done can't be forgiven, realities alter, worldviews collide.  It is more like my reality as a woman than anything I've read or seen. It has helped me embrace my womanhood, no matter how corny that may sound. I think that's why the book has touched so many women so deeply, and maybe why guys are a little nervous to pick it up.      And guys, just because it is a feministy novel does not mean that it isn't accessible or enjoyable.  I think anyone can become enveloped in the fantasy of a druid world, with fairies and dragons, sex and murder.  It's just a little different than your typical Arthurian story.  Try it, it might get you a date!

1402720602|5.0|This is a truly wonderful book and an amazing bargain at the price.  This book gives you an supremely detailed look at the methods used by one master builder.  I am also a builder.<br /><br />The detail contained in the book is (this word keeps coming up) amazing.  He really does cover every step in the process and he describes and photographs every little step of the process including the tools he prefers and uses, even down to series of photos showing how he spreads glue.<br /><br />This book is beautifully executed.  A nicely made hardcover with dust jacket; it's built to last.  The photographs, which may be its greatest strength, are profuse, extremely well made and their reproduction is flawless.  Pretty much every detail of every process used to build a classical guitar is well explained, both in words and in beautiful photographs.  The book includes details of making your own bindings, purflings, and rosettes.  The actual methods used by the author are explained in great detail.  All the tools are described and shown.<br /><br />I started out with Cumpiano and Natelson (Guitar Making:  Tradition and Technology).  That book is still a wonderful book, especially if your interest is in steel string acoustics.

1401216676|5.0|The above title is not hyperbole on my part.  I really do feel, in my humble opinion, that this is THE definitive Joker story.  Not only does it completely turn the mythology of the Batman family on it's ear with the shooting and crippling of Barbara Gordon (something that, if occured in todays market, would be contained within an eight issue mini-series, with tie-ins in every DC comic on the racks - here, it's so sudden and unexpected that it makes it positively horrific) and the heart-breaking origin story for the Joker - a fledgeling stand-up comic who loses his wife, unborn child, and sanity in the span of one day.  And Bolland's art?  Still some of the most cinematic, detail-oriented beauty you will ever find between two covers.  From the opening dialogue-free images of the Batmobile arriving at Arkham to the full-circle shots of Batman and Joker laughing at the Joker's ironic joke as the cops arrive, one would be hard-pressed to find a more complete work of art.  As far as this edition goes, the inclusion of the story and art by Bolland is a fine complement to the main tale.  I've read that some people have an issue with the re-coloring, but honestly, I didn't even notice until it was pointed out.  It's a minor quibble in an otherwise exceptional package.

The flexible material inside allows you to use it for a variety of necessities and provides lots of space. It is quite deep and holds my water bottle and another cup/ bottle as well as keys etc without fear of it tipping over. Some caddies i have seen are soft around the edges and not as structured as this one and they often have a fixed size for water bottles/ cups. The elastic at the top of the cup holder allows any size (within reason), holds the cup snugly and can be pushed out of the way for other items when not in use. It has been great so far.

044024367X|1.0|What a disappointment, and where to begin? Start with a decent protagonist- supposedly the kind of guy who transcends ordinary morals and lives by his fists and wits, and gradually turn him into a windy, pedantic, Cindy Sheehan-styled philosopher. If your hero must be political, at least let him think for himself and not just buy into every knee-jerk, bumper sticker, boiler-plate excuse for political thought that comes down the pike.<br /><br />Next you mix in an improbable background story of an entire Colorado town owned and run by one man that not only does the state turn a blind eye to, but the Feds use to bury their various three-mile island, guantanamo bay and racketeering scandals. In the fevered dreams of the Huffington Post this city may exist, but nowhere else.<br /><br />Finally cap it off with the most politically correct, not to say implausible, terrorist in the history of literature and you have the ingredients of one crappy book, not to put too fine a point on it. The 70 year old pentecostal storefront preacher has diabolical plans that make him seem more like an Austin Powers character than anything like a real person, and our windy protagonist has so many encounters with him that you begin to wonder if they shouldn't ride-share to save time. Oh wait, they do. I don't know what the first eleven Reacher books were like, but there is no way I ever plan to find out. This one was a complete waste of time and energy.<br /><br />Addendum:<br /><br />After reading what a deviation this Reacher book was from his others, I will give one of the others a try. It would be a little easier if this Reacher didn't seem to be a complete renunciation of everything the \\"other Reacher\\" was presumably about. That kind of reversal seems less like just an off book and more like a revelation of true sentiment.

B000XR4OC0|3.0|These shoes are very comfortable, and offer better arch support than most slip-ons, but I expected them to be made of sturdier material; they seem a little flimsy and I doubt they will last more than one season. Considering the construction and material, they cost about twice what they ought to, but that's okay since someone else gets a free pair. (Just know that you, the customer, are paying for that and it's not coming out of Tom's pocket.) It would also be nice if Tom's offered a vegan shoe (these have a leather insole), since they are mostly for tree-hugger types anyway. Buy them; just lower your expectations a tad.
B00000JLWW|3.0|Like many people, I thought the love story between Rose and Jack was crass, silly, poorly written, and unrealistic (the First and Third Class passengers never mingled, and class consciousness was so ingrained at the time that a real-life Jack probably would have had serious doubts that any romance with a rich girl would succeed). Perhaps the nadir of the film is when they engage in a spitting match over the deck of the ship! This vulgarity would have been unheard of in a well-bred girl of the 1900s, no matter how the filmmakers would like to believe that a Rose of the early 20th century would behave like a 1990s spoiled teenager popping bubble gum at a shopping mall. In addition, poor Cal is treated like a villain, even though he gives her the Heart of the Ocean, expects only that she acts like a lady, and treats him with respect. We are asked to identify with Rose, however, as if bad manners and the freedom to spit over a deck is admirable. These are 1990s values, not the 1900s.<br /><br />So why is such a film with glaring inaccuracies so successful and sometimes poignant? The answer lies in the way Cameron strangely mixes in moments of genuine poignancy, loss, and respect for the Titanic dead. Unlike other films, he shows real respect for old people and shows everyone the beautiful young woman lurking beneath an aged crone's face. I cannot remember any other film in which the presumably youth-obsessed audience is asked to remember that elderly Rose Dawson was once a naked, beautiful Kate Winslet. And the ship is treated the same way - he starts the film showing a decayed, ugly, broken down ship and flips back to reveal how beautiful the Titanic was in her youth. Cameron's willingness to capture what it really feels to lose someone through death or through age is what makes the film powerful. Unlike other Hollywood \\"feel-good\\" films, Titanic doesn't stint on the tragedy and finds beauty and meaning in death and even ugliness. Even the Jack character shows an appreciation for beauty in ugly things - he draws pictures of an old lady wearing a moth-eaten coat, waiting for her love to show up, and a one-legged prostitute. The fact that the characters value life, no matter how ugly, and understand how precious life is, makes this film more memorable and more powerful.<br /><br />Some people think the special effects made this movie, but I think it was only part of why it was so successful.

0316010669|3.0|I did the audio book version of this. It had useful content and made me think a little about how people make decisions. Most of the book explains why it's important to give yourself an extra second of time to 'react' instead of making a quick decision or using your gut. I really didn't enjoy this book like many others have. Personally, I think great decisions are made on 'gut' and 'instinct.' The author does reference studies on incidents in american history where scientists compared the results of the actual incident versus a proposed alternative giving them more time to think before acting. Users who took an extra second to break up their unconscious reaction to make it a conscious decision showed greater success in desired results. I think the jury is still out on these studies, and I prefer to think that intuition and natural tendency/gut reactions are a better angle of approach, provided you have confidence in your decision-making and rarely second-guess yourself.
0767821629|4.0|In the course of a fortnight three different unconnected people on Facebook suggested I should see this movie. With that sort of strange juxtaposing of opinions behind it, it was as if the universe itself was wanting me to see The Thirteenth Floor, and who am I to argue with the universe? Having now seen this movie I can report that the universe's ability to recommend motion pictures is impressive. I liked The Thirteenth Floor both in its own right and in its capacity to be a sort of anti-Matrix, a smarter, less flashy, more to the point species of intelligent science fiction lacking back in the late 1990's when it was released in cinemas. As I remember, fantasy-seeking audiences back then went for blazing guns and bleak dystopian landscapes, pleather jumpsuits and characters with names like some sort of neo-retro-visitation of ancient mythos, and it is to their detriment that so many of them missed The Thirteenth Floor back in its initial release. Telling the tale of a murder of one of the brilliant creators of a virtual world so real its denizens believe they are alive, The Thirteenth Floor visits film noir as readily as vintage sci-fi, and does it with a stylish tip of the hat back to some of the biggest films of both genres, from Blade Runner to The Maltese Falcon, and yet as it does it never loses its own claim to classic status. Its twists and turns gyrate through a story that concludes nowhere near where it began and yet somehow ties up every loose end before its magnificently satisfying conclusion. For its recreations of the gritty Los Angeles of yesteryear to its journeys into the human future, The Thirteenth Floor impressed me as much as those Facebook recommendations said it might. It's a cool movie.
B0016Q2D5M|4.0|Brendan Fraser, Anita Briem and Josh Hutcherson go deep in the relatively entertaining tale \\"Journey To The Center Of The Earth.\\"  This version of \\"Journey\\" is not a remake nor is it an adaptation of the Jules Verne adventure that some many other films have been based on.<br /><br />In this particular tale, Fraser plays a seismic geologist named Trevor Anderson who is losing students and his brother's memorial research center at the university where he teaches and does research.  When his nephew, Sean (Hutcherson), comes up to spend a few days with him before moving with his mother to Canada, the pair uncover notes in Sean's father's copy of \\"A Journey to the Center of the Earth\\" that match up with some of Trevor's research.  This leads them to believe that Sean's dad might have been on to something before he went missing in the field.<br /><br />With Sean's father's copy of \\"Journey\\" in tow, a hasty trip to Iceland is planned to check data gathered at one of Trevor's sites.  Notes in the novel lead the pair to an obscure professor's research institute in Iceland where they meet the now-deceased scientist's daughter, Hannah (Briem).  She agrees to guide them on their quest and then the three of them literally journey to the center of the Earth.<br /><br />Once the group enters the cave that will eventually lead to the center of the Earth, the viewer is offered a ton of visual oohh's and ahhh's.<br /><br />Originally shot in 3-D, the film relies on the gimmick a bit too much at times and the plot suffers for it.  The CGI is very vibrant and colorful, and can be sketchy at certain points.  However, the entire film has a light air to it, and the sometimes goofy CGI only aids to this.

0307341569|5.0|Flynn's novel has the effect of blunt force trauma. With icy precision and an eye for the consequences of poverty and despair, this novel hums with discordance and the chronic misery of a family mired in unhappiness. In January, 1985, Libby Day is the survivor of a family massacre, at seven years old the only witness to the murder of her mother and two sisters on their Kansas farm. Libby's brother, Ben, has spent the last twenty-five years in jail for what an avid press describes as \\"The Satan Sacrifice of Kinnakee Kansas\\". A sullen, angry teenager, Ben proves an uncooperative person of interest, the public promptly labeling him a drug-addicted Satanist. Now in her thirties, Libby bears the scars of that harrowing night, when she climbed from her mother's bedroom window to escape her family's grisly fate. Carefully coached, Libby is the star witness against Ben, the jury happy to put an end to the nightmare scenario of the butchered Day family, Ben an obvious target.<br /><br />An unlikely heroine, Libby is profoundly depressed, suicidal and nearly out of funds from a trust set up for the surviving victim of the crimes. A product of her environment, Libby is a manipulative liar and opportunist, a thief of people's belongings, anything to momentarily assuage the gaping hole in her life without family or hope. Approached by the Kill Club, a loose group of true crime aficionados, Libby seizes an opportunity to earn some desperately needed money by selling selected family memorabilia and visiting the brother she has not spoken to since her testimony in court. Her world already painfully distorted by the murders, contacting Ben is but another step down a dark path toward oblivion. Fearless, Libby has been waiting to die since that terrible January night.<br /><br />This novel is shocking, brutal and disconcerting, an unsparing exploration of people and their motives, a harsh landscape that questions long-held assumptions about the human capacity for violence. The Days are the object of ridicule, their hand-me-down clothes and indelible mark of less-than. It is easy to recoil, to point the finger of guilt at the angst-riddled teenager, Ben, and donate money for the profoundly disturbed survivor, who bounces from place to place wreaking havoc on those who provide shelter. And as the facts of that night are revealed, layer after layer of ugliness is exposed, a confluence of violence that fills the air with screams, then silence. From the Day family to Ben's questionable associates and his flirtation with the forbidden, from bone-crushing poverty and the banality of true evil, Flynn crafts a masterpiece of cold-blooded horror with no happy ending, daring the reader to look away. Stripping the mask of innocence from the predictable response to a heinous crime, Flynn stares into the void, daring us to do the same.

B001P9KR8U|5.0|A truly beautiful film that takes you through the poverty of India, but that also gives you a glimpse of the life force that radiates in the colors and music of this emerging economic power.  It is at it's heart a love story - and a beautiful one at that.  Love conquers all.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|This movie was just as simple and interestng. Completely different Queer as Folk behavior lol and no strong violence, language, sexual content or anything like that at all. just bromance, love, little comedy and compassion in every sense of the word. Must see
B000XTLUW0|5.0|This is a \\"must have\\" for anyone out there who considers themselves a Muser.  They kicked serious a$$ at this show.  Through the numerous times I've watched the DVD and listened to the CD I've noticed that they've definitely done a fair amount of touching up the sound on the CD and some of the riffs sound a bit different from DVD to CD, but that's not really a big deal to me as they've still kept their \\"sound.\\"  They also touched up Matt's voice cracking at the end of Take A Bow which you can hear on the DVD but is \\"fixed\\" on the CD.  I just think that's kind of funny, really.  Stockholm Syndrome, Plug In Baby, Apocalypse Please, and Blackout are definitely my favorites.  This album gives me mega chills, especially some of Matt's killer guitar riffs.  Frickin' awesome.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|This album is simple, stripped down, breathy, and full of emotion.  This is my first album of hers and I have to say it probably won't be my last.  It is too bad that you either seem to love or hate this album.   I would recommend that you prescreen these songs so you get a feel for the album before you buy it. I am glad I am one of the five star reviewers whom love this album.  It is a good relaxing buy! It was a easy buy for me!!!
B001IBIQU6|1.0|I have read a lot of \\"first I didn't like the album, but it's slowly growing on me\\" comments. A really good album doesn't have to grow on you. If any fan listens to this album, they have to quickly realize that SOTU is DM's worst album ever. With the exception of Wrong, there's not a single song on this album that really kicks in or even close to listenable music. We won't even listen to Wrong in a few years, it is a pretty forgettable song.    Let's face it: this album is abysmal. It's unsexy, and there's no excitement. Even Exciter and A Broken Frame beat this album easily. Have the Basildon Three totally lost their ear for music??
0440238609|4.0|The book arived sooner then was quoted and in very good condition.<br />I'm enjoying the book. Fast moving with very intersting charactors.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|I have been a fan of hers for several years and own many of her albums/CD's. This latest: \\"Quiet Nights\\" exceeded my expectations and continues to delight me. I enjoy both her singing as well as her piano playing skill. To me, a \\"wanna-be\\" pianist who does practice and play a little, when she combines the two I am most delighted and find it exhilirating. To me this was a worthwhile investment. I am hoping to \\"luck out\\" and see her someday in person at Yoski's either in Oakland or San Francisco, CA. Our cousins are also fans of hers and are waiting for the same opportunity.
B000AMPZF8|5.0|I'm a huge Muse fan so I'm probably pretty biased, but this is arguably their best album even though it is close second on my list (to Absolution) as far as their main album releases go.  I'd definitely recommend it to everyone.
1594481717|2.0|There's a good idea in this book: businesses need to compete on aesthetics and not just utility. This is a good idea, but Pink isn't content with a good idea. He needs a BIG idea; something to put him on the map with Peter Drucker and Tom Peters. So he puffs this little idea up into something that it just can't carry off.    I can almost imagine Pink and Peters having this conversation.    Pink: I have a great idea for a book! Marketers need to focus more on design and less on utility. Waddya think?    Peters: Think bigger. Think how this is changing the world! It's a Whole New...What?    Pink: Mmmm...okay, maybe we're moving out of the information age and into a new age! A Conceptual Age! It's a Whole New Age!    Peters: Good! I like it! It's the END of the Information Age and the beginning of a Whole New Age! Ooh - CEO's will fly you in charter to hear about that.    Pink: Yeah! It's a Whole New Age - the Conceptual Age - and you need to invest in aesthetics if you're going to survive!    Peters: Bah! Aesthetics! Now you sound too artsy-fartsy! CEO's will laugh you out of the room. Bigger, Pink, bigger!    Pink: Okay, you need to learn a whole new way of looking at the world - more relational, more significance, more meaning!    Peters: Great! Too abstract for anyone to pin you down but who would disagree with \\"more meaning\\"! And what do you need to survive in this Conceptual Age?    Pink: A Whole New....A WHOLE NEW...A WHOLE NEW MIND! But do you think people will buy it?    Peters: Hah! They bought Seth Godin, didn't they? And he didn't have a practical idea his whole life! Besides, if you put my name all over it, people will suck it up like the next Britney Spears album.    Ultimately, this little book cannot carry off its big mission of convincing us the world as we know it is changing. Pink cannot pull together a coherent argument to give it weight. Instead, he uses loosely defined terms, barely related anecdotes and briefly summarized studies forming a tenuous thread to hold it all together. Pressing on his assumptions unravels the whole thing, such as his argument that left-brain work is being outsourced to India (isn't right-brain work also being outsourced to India?).     This little idea just doesn't have wide enough shoulders to carry off, and Pink's bombastics makes an otherwise useful little idea into a big waste of time for the reader. But a hefty brochure for the author.
B001HN69AE|5.0|I watched it and loved it. I didn't walk in thinking \\"Hey, I get to watch Dragonball over but Live action.\\" It's a 85min adaptation with a twist. They did a good job with the actors, they can act and they were pretty close to the personalities they had on the show. I can't wait for the DVD/BlueRay release and can't wait even more for the next movie. Maby we'll see Vegeta and maby even Gohan, never know!
B001PPLIEG|5.0|Although I have purchased DVD's that don't play well on my video equipment, this DVD was in excellent condition, and I didn't have to wait too long for its arrival!
B001CJJWV6|5.0|I wish there were more quality documents to this amazing time, but they are unfortunately few and far between.  Capturing history on film is a rare thing, and capturing it with incredible sound is even more so.  This is without a doubt a must see for any Hendrix fan, diehard or casual.  The performance is phenomenal, and the picture and sound - especially the sound, are excellent.  The film -especially the interviews - is really illuminating for someone like myself who had heard the performance on CD for years, but had not actually seen the entire performance or knew the story behind the Festival.  Again, a really amazing document captured here.  I don't believe the entire Festival is available yet on BluRay, but when it is I'd love to have it.  Of course it might seem anticlimactic since it appears that only a handful of performances could even light a candle to Hendrix.
B001FBSMW6|5.0|Good grief I love every track on this album! I love that they keep reinventing themselves. I recommend listening to all their albums because you'll always be entertained. Maybe I'm just partial to that velvety voice... lol!
B001GCUO1G|4.0|Do you want to know how Wolverine got those shiny claws?  Do you want to know about his past?  Do you want to know why he has lost memories?  If you answered yes to all or to at least one of those questions, then \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" is something you should check out for the answer(s).    Hugh Jackman returns as Wolverine to show us, finally, where he came from.  We get a glimpse of his birth sometime in the 19th century.  We see that Wolverine is a war-weary soldier who's fought in battles ranging from the Civil War all the way up to Vietnam.  We see the beast that lies within him and what drives all his rage.    Some of what you know about the other \\"X-Men\\" films needs to be forgotten, particularly anything to do with Sabretooth.  In \\"Origins\\" the Sabretooth character is re-imagined as Wolverine's half brother, which has been subject of comic book fan speculation.    \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" is as solid as adamantium.  The re-imagining of Sabretooth worked well and created an emotional connection between protagonist and antagonist.  Jackman was solid again as Wolverine.  But, he seems overshadowed by Liev Schreiber as Sabretooth who gave a much more dark, menacing performance.  Overall, the film is well made and thoroughly exciting.      Comic book fans will probably nitpick at whatever they see fit.  But, the bottom line is that \\"Origins\\" is much better than the dreadful \\"X-Men: The Last Stand\\" and seems to be clawing at the origins of something great.    Insider tip: Stay for the end of the credits, there is a hidden scene.
B001TH16DS|5.0|Awsome quality. great price. Lots of work went into this restoration. Looks better than many of my new blu-ray movies. I just pray the rest of the trek shows are given such TLC.
B0014NDXGA|3.0|This rangefinder seems to be accurate but it is extremely difficult to lock in on a flag without a super steady hand. I have tried using a club to help steady my aim but it is still difficult. The best result I have had is when I can hold it against a golf cart while aiming. If your target was the size of a golf cart, this device would be ideal. The benefit of a rangefinder vs. a GPS device is you get an \\"exact\\" yardage to the hole and you don't need to worry about any downloads of courses or annual subscriptions to get courses loaded onto your GPS device. However, after several rounds of use, I think I would rather the ease of using a GPS device and getting a very good yardage estimate over the sometimes frustrating use of a rangefinder just to get an exact number.
B0002W18MU|5.0|I'd heard a song on the radio from this album & I loved it.  I tried to  find the album locally & was unable to, so I ordered it from Amazon.com &  when it arrived, I immediately went to my car, inserted the CD & enjoyed  an amazing, fabulous rendition of Johnny Cash numbers that really brought  out his feelings.  It is absolutely wonderful.  I'm thinking of buying  the series, one at a time until I have them all.  He was & will remain a  favorite of mine.
B001TH16DS|5.0|This series was and is fantastic, and the new version with restored colors really makes it even more so.  You can see little subtle things that you couldnt see on the older, more washed out broadcasts.      In the episode I reviewed last night \\"Charlie X\\" the subtle human expressions that Blu-ray can show made the viewing much, much better for me.  The Childish angst of the man-child Charlie came across much better, and therefore the psychological aspect of the show was much better.      In the fan adored \\"Balance of Terror\\"  The ship to ship facelift was fascinating without looking sort of overdone.  (I felt this way on the Star Wars remasters)You got to see ship drift, comet particulares (needed for the story)     In the episode \\"Where No Man Has Gone Before\\" planet side we see cloud momentum, and Gary Mitchell was alot more interestign with the richness of detail to his face and silver eyes.  it was more human, yet inhuman.    I got this as a very casual fan, I have not watched the series or anything of it in many, many years but I do recommend this set.  To me it is the best restoration job I have seen in a long time.
B00192KCQ0|5.0|Even though I actually did like St. Anger, I definitely felt it paled in comparison to Master of Puppets and And Justice For All.  It was good to hear a really, really solid Metallica album in \\"Death Magnetic\\".  I like that they shied away from the Nu-Metal sound and went back to their \\"classic\\" style.  The guitars are definitely thicker than their traditional sound but stylistically, it's pretty classic Metallica.<br /><br />My favorite song on the album is \\"Broken, Beaten & Scarred\\".  I love the riff on that one.  And the solo section is killer as well.  Oh yes, I must mention that they've gone back to putting changes in the songs.  So you get the classic thrash of old Metallica that we all love them for.  I really like \\"The Day That Never Comes\\".  That one's slower but has a great solo and thrash section as well.<br /><br />I could go on listing songs but the point is that this album is back to the thrash style and if you like old Metallica, you will like this album.  It's better than anything else they did after \\"And Justice For All\\".  Look, nothing's going to top their early stuff... they're in their 50s for Christ's sake!  But for a bunch of 50 year olds, they can really kick some serious metal jams!
B0000041LO|5.0|This recording of Haydn's Piano Trios by the Beaux Arts Trio must surely rank as one of the most outstanding recording cycles ever made. Such a statement, perhaps absurd at face value, is easily understood once you've sat down and listened to the first two or three disks in the set. The intense beauty and the powerful emotion of Haydn's piano trios simply pours forth and even oozes out right from the onset of disk 1 track 1 and doesn't stop until the last disk is played. The music is so hauntingly beautiful and superbly performed that nearly anyone - even those without a background in classical music - can almost immediately be drawn into the lyrical world inhabited that \\"Papa Haydn\\" creates for us.  Look at the words chosen by some of the reviewers here: \\"treasure,\\" \\"classic,\\" \\"pick of the litter,\\" \\"beautiful,\\" \\"delightful,\\" \\"gems,\\" and on and on, and you'll see this is the nearly uniform judgment of an entire group of listeners.<br /><br />I purchased this set at the FNAC in Paris during a trip back in 2005, and must confess that I was simply picking up the set of nine disks because I thought it a good addition to a classical library. Goodness, was I ever surprised beyond expectations when I started listening to the recording. This is music in superb form, beautifully and lovingly crafted by a master composer, and then executed with style and warmth by performers who not only are experts at their craft, but deeply understanding of what Papa Haydn himself wished to convey through these works. Astonished as I was with disk one, I knew this feeling was unlikely to be sustained through the next eight disks, and, of course, you can guess the rest of the story: I quickly found that the power and emotion of the start is held throughout the entire series.<br /><br />Haydn, like Handel, is often overlooked in today's classical world. If you've ever heard someone say something to the effect of \\"If you've heard one Haydn piece, you've heard them all,\\" here is a set that will dash such views. In fact, to go through these pieces over and over is to help one understand the true genius of Haydn, a person who executed his skills without pompousness or showmanship, but through sublime creativity, bursting forth like new flowers on a wet, sunny morning. The Beaux Arts Trio takes these pieces and then makes them their own, and we, the listeners, are the ones who benefit from the association.<br /><br />Make no doubt about it, this is one of the most brilliant and lovely set of recordings you are likely ever to hear. This set was recorded in the 1970's, you say? You'd never know it. It sounds as good - or better - than any digital recording of the past few years. It is the rarest of occurrences to come across a recording where such superb results are achieved, but here it is, all tied up in a little package. This is a set to treasure, but also to explore and study. It will keep you busy for a long time, and you'll probably savor every minute of it.s.

B001UREJWM|4.0|This is doom in broad strokes, coming from a Black Sabbath line-up which, while oft-lauded as the forefathers of \\"doom,\\" wasn't really all that straight-up dark until their 3rd album together, 1992's near-perfect \\"Dehumanizer.\\" And while \\"The Devil You Know\\" is a logical extension of that record, it also reflects the more recent riffing tendencies of guitarist Tony Iommi, as seen in his recent solo work (as well as the scant 2 new studio songs the original Sabbath/Ozzy line-up managed to get out of the last 15 years of reunion touring).     The end result is a slow, heavy, stately album. None of the groove of early Sabbath will be found here, nor the more up-tempo aspects of \\"Heaven and Hell\\" and \\"Mob Rules.\\" It still works, though, because it seems to play to the contemporary strengths of all 4 players.    It opens very well with \\"Atom and Evil,\\" \\"Fear,\\" and the stellar \\"Bible Black,\\" all crushing, doomy tunes (although to be fair, \\"Fear\\" is a little more up-tempo and syncopated). The bass is high in the mix, bringing us bassist Geezer Butler's rumbling, familiar-but-effective pentatonic coloration beneath Tony Iommi's mammoth, saturated guitar roar. Drummer Vinnie Appice backs it all up with a welcome less-is-more approach, though it would be nice if his drums breathed a little more sonically, a la the Bonham-esque tonality found on \\"Dehumanizer.\\"     Things flag a little with track 4, \\"Double The Pain,\\" a song with a monster opening riff that morphs into a mid-tempo rocker with incomprehensible, slightly silly lyrics and a disappointing chorus. Speaking of lyrics, Dio has always been hit-or-miss on this front, and they get in the way at times on this album. Take the weakest offering, \\"Rock and Roll Angel.\\" A cheesy title from the outset, and the lyrics aren't any better. They make no sense at all that I can discern, which is too bad since the music is actually pretty good.     On the lyrical hit side, there's \\"Follow The Tears,\\" a true wicked doom dirge that basically tells the listener that altruism and morality are not rewarded. Ask for more, Dio says, or be left \\"swinging in the air.\\" The main riff on this one is lethal, and the song features Iommi's best solo of the album, a fragmented tapestry of quasi-dissonant bends and wails. In the same vein is the CD's closer, \\"Breaking Into Heaven,\\" which is about exactly that. Dio has always worried over themes of damnation and redemption, and here he's just fed up and ready to re-take paradise by force. The music compliments the sentiment perfectly, being an inexorable death march featuring an extra-heavy, delayed gratification chorus.    All in all, this album delivers to the tune of, well, about 8/10. \\"The Devil You Know\\" is a worthy addition to the Dio/Iommi/Butler/Appice catalog of Sabbathica, and is far better than Iommi & Co. could ever realistically hope to get out of Ozzy Osbourne these days. Ozzy is worn-out, vocally and creatively, while Dio still shines like the diamonds he's so fond of singing about, albeit in a slightly lower register. Speaking of the low register, it's also nice to see Iommi sludging around in the old \\"Master of Reality/Vol. 4\\" tuning. Bottom line: this is metal. Iommi and Butler invented it. And they're still doing it, and doing it well.

B001PJRAUS|5.0|If there is anyone out there who loves Pride and Prejudice that HASN'T dreamed of being Elizabeth Bennett and being magically transported into Jane Austen's classic novel, I would be greatly surprised.<br /><br />This is the ultimate fantasy: girl hates her life, wishes for romance and adores Jane Austen, and somehow gets stuck in the novel herself. She is sucked into the daily life of the characters as they go through the events in the novel right from when Charles Bingly moved into Netherfield Park. Of course, this isn't real Austen. Our heroine does more damage than she intends, and Charles Bingly falls in love with her instead of Jane. Her actions totally throw the story of the novel out of sequence, leaving the audience to wonder how anything will ever be straightened out.<br /><br />Ever since I first read Pride and Prejudice, I wished that I could be Elizabeth, and I thought of many different ways the novel could go. What if I could convince Mr. Collins to marry Mary Bennett? What if I managed to get Wickham to fall for Caroline Bingly? What if Charlotte Lucas married Colonel Fitzwilliam? There are so many different endings, and this is a wonderful way to imagine yourself in Elizabeth Bennett's shoes. I do hope they make more like this!<br /><br />I admit that I spent an entire rainy afternoon and evening watching this miraculous TV show. I hoped it would never end!
B001TH16DS|5.0|Ok, let me first say that if you are a true Trek fan from the beginning then you have got to have this set and the other seasons that will follow in this Blu-Ray series!  There has been much controversy over anyone attempting to enhance or alter in any way the look, feel and mood of the original series.  I totally get that concern.  What you have in this set is the best of both worlds folks.  You are given an extremely pristine copy of the original series untouched!<br /><br />However, what will astoundingly blow you away is the painstakingly enhanced version of the original series.  There is a most excellent short documentary included that is a must see.  It chronicles in a very interesting way all the care that was taken to clean up the original very badly fading tape of this series and NOT do a cheap colorized glitzy make-over but a very clean update of these films.  We see a number of the original people behind the scenes with Gene Roddenberry who admit that \\"THIS\\" indeed is the look they and Gene were originally attempting to get but couldn't at the time due to technology limitations.<br /><br />The films truly are spectacular in either version and the sound has really been improved.  Yes, I know many so-called fake & phony purists will say \\"but it wasn't done originally in 7.1\\".  Yawn!  Duh?, because Gene didn't HAVE 7.1 at the time!  Well we do now and it's great and it works and you'll love it!  Gene didn't do it in Hi Def either because he couldn't, but he sure would have if the technology was there and Paramount gave him the budget.  Well we have it today and it works and works well.  The original magic of this series is very well preserved and I was delighted to see the original people who made it say so!

B000007638|4.0|the opening medley of Venus and Mars/Rock Show/Jet and the 4 song encore of Letting Go, Band On the Run, Hi Hi Hi & Soily, are the only real highlights of this recording.   TRIPPING THE LIVE FANTASTIC  captures Paul live much better. If only for the killer live version of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.   So, if you want to hear Paul really good live get TRIPPING first. Then get this. And forget about the other live releases. Especially PAUL IS LIVE. This and TRIPPING are the only 2 live recordings by Paul you'll ever need.     GREG
B001TH16DS|5.0|\\"Space. The last area left to explore.  This is the story of the spaceship Enterprise, for five years it will look for unusual planets, find different cultures, and will be determined to go to many new locations.\\"     All my research points to this being a great value, and is a huge improvement over the 2000 DVD's.  Buy it and live Star Trek all over again!  You know you must.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Great video. Jillian makes it easy for you to keep up and makes you feel not guilty of easing into it!
B001R4KQDE|4.0|To preface this, if you are a fan of the movie you already own the 2005 [[ASIN:B000BCKFWK Sin City - Unrated (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)]], the deluxe package that ships with The Hard Goodbye graphic novel. Easily the best DVD release in my collection. There's just so much on there to like: Rodriguez prefaces each DVD w/an intro and there's quirky comic book menus that pop in and out which are a joy for us comic book geeks. So do you want the blu-ray of this?    I've done a quick taste test and I won't be selling my regular DVD release anytime soon. The colors do pop a little bit more on the blu-ray, but damn they are sharp as hell on the regular release, so you are really getting this for the Kill `Em Good: Interactive Comic Book and the CinExplore Feature. Worth it, but ehhhhhh, as a fan of the blu-ray format they really do need to be making these the \\"must have\\" definitive versions of the release and not an afterthought of what came before.    To be fair, most of these ship w/a $10 redeemable coupon, if you own the standard DVD release, so thank you, thank you. This is a worthwhile purchase, all things considered, but blu-ray releases need to start standing out as \\"must haves\\" or only 10% of the movie buying population is ever going to care.

B000IU3Y1O|5.0|I grew up in the 80's idolizing this band who has a claim for being one of the greatest bands ever.  There recent albums haven't been as strong as their 80's and 90's albums but I still enjoy them.  Ok, now my subject here is that this is called Best Of Volume 1, will there be a Best Of Volume 2?  There's a whole slew of early videos they can include on Volume 2 including See You, The Meaning Of Love, Get The Balance Right, Love In Itself, etc.  They can also do a full dvd of all of their UK TV Appearances on shows such as Top Of The Pops.  Just can't get enough of Depeche Mode, pun intended!
B00005221M|4.0|This was a beautiful well acted movie when it came out, and is still a beautiful movie, although I have taken a star off for the directors cut version.    Why do directors feel compelled to re-do their work after the fact?  And, what was Michael Mann thinking by taking out the Clannad song?  It was a haunting and poignant song that captured the essence of the moment as Nathaniel was rushing to save Cora, and that ultimately led to the climax of the movie.  In this case, the song should have been left in, and would have added to the movie, as it did in the original version.    I would have liked a few bonus sections, such as how the movie was made, and maybe an explanation of the times it was based in.  I understand that Daniel Day-Lewis, Russell Means and Eric Schweig had to train strenuously for the fight scenes and racing up those big mountains.  A little information like that in the directors cut would have been interesting.
B0012GMYTG|5.0|Not having a single bad song on the album, \\"Hey Stoopid\\" should be a more bought and talked-about album than it is. While there are many guest stars on this album from bands that were popular at the time, the album is more a return to the style he had in the 70's. It's like Classic Alice with an updated production.
0307010856|5.0|my kids absolutely love this book.  i have to say that i love it too because it's easy to imitate grover's voice and my kids just crack up.  i feel like a great mother for making my kids laugh and sending them to bed with such wonderful thoughts of us together.
B001TH16DS|1.0|I tried these discs in two different Blu ray players and they would not play in either one.  I was disappointed.
B001QOOCTE|5.0|I have been looking, for some time now, for some new music that will make me really look forward to playing it over and over and over again.  Well, this is it!  Not only is the music and musicians phenomenal...the cause is completely worth getting involved in.  Please listen and JOIN!
0060900075|5.0|Thanks for the great book. Arrived on time in excellent condition. Well worth it. Thanks again!
076790592X|5.0|This is a must-have book. I initially read this book at my workplace (I am a note taker for the disabled). After I completed the book, I was inspired, motivated by the story. Hence, I bought three more copies for my family and friends. This book is highly recommended to anyone because the language is simple and the story truthfully reflects the importance in life.
B000JBWWRY|5.0|I'm so glad we brought Peter Pan.I haven't seen this movie in years. We had our grandson's over, they watched Peter Pan for the first time and loved it..They watched it over and over...So for Easter we got our grandson's Peter Pan DVD, they were so excited.....
B0000AQS0F|5.0|You don't have to be a hardcore science fiction fan or uber geek to enjoy this series.  The characters, not the setting, make the show.<br /><br />I did have a technical issue with the first DVD.  The menu page sticks on occassion, but I've had no problems viewing the shows on the disc.  Haven't tried the other discs yet, but hopefully they will be ok.
031606792X|4.0|I liked the third book more, but Breaking Dawn was definitely fun to read with a good amount of excitement.
B00122Z5RI|5.0|As the UK prepared to celebrate the Queen's silver jubilee in 1977, youth unemployment was high, a sanitation strike left garbage piling up in the streets of London. What were the kids supposed to do?  Spend their entire dole money to see some washed up rock band perform a tired old stadium show?  I think not.  You might argue about when, where and how punk rock began, but for many British kids it began right here. NEVER MIND THE BOLLOCKS HERE'S THE SEX PISTOLS encapsulated the fed-up, rebellious, gob-in-your-face mood of the times with a collection of songs intended to antagonize parents, diss the Royal Family and promote anarchy in the UK (unless you were a \\"lazy sod\\" who thought that would be too much effort).  With a message that still resonates today, The Pistols summed up the DIY aesthetic of punk rock in a world where the established pillars of society were collapsing all around.  \\"The problem is you.  What you gonna do?\\"
B0000E1ALR|5.0|As the most important voice in music over the last 35 years, compiling the most important recordings in Bruce Springsteen's career to three discs (including one including never before released outtakes as opposed to some truly important cuts that missed inclusion on the first two discs) is in no way an easy task. For every \\"Born To Run\\" and \\"Dancing In The Dark\\" that's included, there's a \\"Growin' Up\\" and \\"Backstreets\\" that's missing the cut.<br /><br />\\"The Essential Bruce Springsteen\\" is the compilation in question, and despite the glaring omissions, it does a pretty good job on the whole. You get the timeless rock anthems that helped shape Bruce into the almost mythical figure he is today (\\"Born To Run,\\" \\"Badlands\\"), the epic narrative pieces with unforgettable characters and locale (\\"Thunder Road,\\" \\"Jungleland\\"), the classic hit singles (\\"Hungry Heart,\\" \\"Glory Days\\"), and latter day accomplishments (\\"The Rising,\\" \\"Lonesome Day\\"). In between, we get a host of forgotten gems such as \\"Blinded By The Light,\\" (far better than the more famous Manfred Mann cover), \\"For You,\\" \\"Tunnel Of Love,\\" and a few from Bruce's underrated 1992-97 period (the haunting \\"Youngstown,\\" unfortunately, is another missed gem from this era). To throw a few more superlatives upon this collection, the songs are remastered and sound amazing.<br /><br />The third disc also includes some very welcome treats. Two songs that, up until this collection's 2003 release, remained available only through diehard collectors finally pop up, \\"County Fair\\" and the sublime \\"Born In The U.S.A.\\" outtake \\"None But The Brave.\\" The \\"The River\\" outtake \\"Held Up Without A Gun,\\" with shared vocals by Bruce and Little Steven Van Zandt, is presented in its (until 2008) only live performance ever, from the famous 1980 New Years Eve show at Nassau Coliseum. Other gems include  \\"From Small Things (Big Things One Day Come),\\" the ethereal \\"Lift Me Up,\\" written for the John Sayles film \\"Limbo\\" but never available on Bruce compilation until now, and \\"Dead Man Walkin',\\" a haunting composition from the Sean Penn / Susan Sarandon film of the same name.<br /><br />As mentioned, a host of classics from Bruce's career failed to make the cut, and their absence is definitely notable and noticeable. However, this doesn't take away from the fact this is still solid primer for beginning Springsteen fans, a crash course to some of the greatest music ever recorded.il now, and \\"Dead Man Walkin',\\" a haunting composition from the Sean Penn / Susan Sarandon film of the same name.

0156013983|5.0|This book arrived before the estimated arrival in an efficient maner. I am very pleased with the company that sent the book and also thought that their packaging was eco-friendly because there was not any excess that wasn't needed.
B00268EVL8|5.0|I am an avid book reader.  I go through about two books a week.  I slowed down on my reading to savor this book.  I never wanted it to end and when I finally finished reading, it was bittersweet.  I knew that I had just finished reading what is probably one of the greatest books ever written.  In the most simplistic form, this is a book about life.  Just do yourself a favor and start reading immediately.  You won't be disappointed.
B001PU8N0I|5.0|It seems screenwriter Andrew Davies just has a knack for adapting major literature masterpieces onto the screen with great detail and spirit.  Little Dorrit is one more success he can claim...  Of course  it is not just a superb screenplay that makes a mini-series adaptation a success...  It takes great acting, and we have it on display from all cast members here.  I am not a Matthew Macfadyen fan, and I disliked his Pride and Prejudice perfomance as Darcy to no end...  that said, I like him plenty in his role here as Arthur Clennam!  Claire Foy makes a great debut as the title character, and the supporting cast is all top notch.  BBC tends to excel at adapting the classics, and this one sits right below Pride and Prejudice (1995) and I Claudius as one of the best...  Pretty good company in my opinion!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I heard everyone talk about this on [...] and I thought...sure...whatever.  I've tried about 10 workout DVDs and each one is either not hard enough or doesn't show proper form/do the same reps on each side of the body.  I used to teach kickboxing at my gym so I learned a lot about proper form and like to really work hard.  So even though I was skeptical I purchased this because I'd like a little addition to my workouts to up the intensity.      WOW....all the things people say about this DVD is totally true... it's FREAKIN' HARD!  But not so hard that it's impossible....but WOW....it's good!  She's also great at telling you the proper form so you don't hurt yourself and showing modifications.  It's a really great DVD workout.  Enjoy!
B0017ANAZO|5.0|great gift.
B001NOMNZW|5.0|If you already saw the first and the second HSM you'll not regret seen this one, because is great. I don't know which one is better. And the songs... You just see yourself singing all day long. I really love it!
B001IBIQU6|5.0|I don't understand the hatred for this album. I think it is stunning, both in terms of its production and its music. It didn't need to grow on me, either; I loved it from the first listen (I enjoy  a fair bit of experimental electronic music, so maybe that had something to do with it). The vintage synths sound warm and fat, the sound is simultaneously gritty and high-end sounding, the harmonies are as beautiful as ever, and, most of all, it is surprising. It is not DM just repeating themselves. I am tempted to say it's one of their best in a while: I liked the first five tracks of \\"Playing the Angel\\",  but I felt it trailed off after that. I enjoyed \\"Ultra\\", but it's production wasn't as interesting as the sonics here. Overall, a wonderful collection of inventive, excellently produced tracks.
0953104907|4.0|All in all a pretty good book and I am building my first guitar using this as my only book in hand. I say \\"maybe not Great\\" due to some specifics not being found or somewhat glossed over. The conversational writing style is easy to read although for me personally it may detract from the reference material aspect of the book. I'm used to much drier technical documentation and instruction. I'd like to see a copy of Martin Koch's book as his website and previews I've seen make me think that would be a fairly detailed book. Perhaps more than one book is the resolution.
B001P9KR94|5.0|Excellent movie.  Well cast and totally entertaining. Many think they know the story and it is not what one thinks it is.  Very heartwarming and at the same time very stark in some of its portrayals of life in the slums.    Other items on my personal top 10 list include: Godfather 1 & 2, Seven, Age of Innocence, Ben-Hur, Schindlers List, Apocalyse Now, Silence of the Lambs, StarGate, Braveheart......
B001W63DY6|3.0|I too was at a few of these concerts (Chicago and Lauderdale) and to say Babs was not in the best voice is an understatement.  Let me start off by saying that there is no bigger fan than I and I agree that even on Barbra's worst day, she is still better than just about anyone else, but ... that doesn't give her license to get lazy (vocally).  It was quite strange seeing her live this time; she would occassionally hit a bumb note, but then within the same song she would become literally as crystal clear as one of her albums.  Trust me when I say, this DVD has been SERIOUSLY edited, and that's OK; it  certainly explains the ridiculous delay.  By the time she hit Europe, the voice was REALLY in bad shape so it's not suprising none of that footage was used.  Her belting days are most definantly over and I guess if she just sticks with songs that fit this new handicap, she can still thrill (just in a different way). It is for this reason that I am particularily looking forward to the new CD with Krall, assuming it will be a \\"quieter\\" album with a jazzier feel.  BTW, I was thankful that the Ill Diva footage was used to a minimum.
B001TH16DS|5.0|Hi. The first time I have seen these episodes were on a regular TV in the 70's and in french ! Afterwards, I recorded all of them on TV and bought a few episodes on VHS then DVD. I then bought the HD DVD combo of season 1 months ago. I can still play it on HD DVD as I have a combo player. So after I read it was finally coming out on BD (Blu-ray), I was extremely happy. I have only seen a few minutes of it but I can report it is extremely good. 1) the case compared to HD DVD combo is fantastic now. 2) We can now toggle between enhanced and non-enhanced versions with the angle button. Great ! We have both versions of the show, by the way, even greater ! I personally like the enhanced version better, the special effects are not overwhelming and they look so nice. 3) We have tons of extra stuff on it, PIP features (picture-in-picture) for BD players v.1.1. and it's also BD-Live 2.0. 4) The discs are loading ok in my player and we will not need a firmware update to see this. Thank god ! Paramount/CBS have done it right ! 5) a decent price (80$ cdn), and not in the 140$ cdn range like a few years back ! 6) Sound Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono and DTS-HD Master Audio 7.1. Wow. Can't wait for seasons 2 & 3 coming hopefully this year with the same quality. If Paramount/CBS execs are reading Amazon's reviews, I tell you this: continue on this path and congratulations on this awesome release. My HIGHEST RECOMMENDATIONS on this BD. Take care all. (ps: my BD player is a Samsung BD-UP5000).
B0000542D2|5.0|This movie brings back the memories. It is high quality. I find myself singing along. Love it!
B000059XUO|5.0|A smashing hit, and a nostalgiac wonder: The Crow is a wonderful action flick that just screams Awesome.    Purchasing from the people I did, I was glad to see they sent me an excellent in-wrapping package. 5 stars~
031606792X|2.0|Don't get me wrong - I enjoyed this series. However, I was never as deeply into it as many are. For some reason, especially in the first novel, I found the dialogue tedious and cheesy, the characters a little too clichè, and the overall story just a little uninteresting, even though I am a lover of vampire novels. However, I decided to give these books a decent try, and thoroughly began to enjoy them in the second and third novels, when the characters had some excellent development, and the plot became more exciting. However, this book did not finish the series well. Since I don't want to be a spoiler, let me just say that the ending was FAR too syrupy. Everything ended PERFECTLY. Now, in order to make a good book, there has to be sacrifice of some kind - not just making everyone happy because it's nice. A few tears are what make a book memorable. These books had potential, but unfortunately I don't feel it was lived up to.
0140177396|5.0|This was my first book by Steinbeck and it surely won't be my last!  Classic literature written so well that I was in the story seeing, feeling and living it along side the characters!
031606792X|2.0|I loved the previous Twilight books. The stories were intriging and I could get into them. I was rooting for the characters and I couldn't put the books down! Breaking Dawn...I put this down at least 5 or 6 times before I forced myself to finish. The story was way too sugary for me. There were no battles or tribulations to overcome. There was nothing in this story that sparked my interest..not even \\"Nessie\\" Edward and Bella's daughter. It truly irritated me to learn that Jacob had imprinted on Nessie!!! Huhhhhh!!!! Why? Why? That was sooo wrong! I would rather have Jacob just be a real good friend to Bella and imprint on another girl who they could have put in the story as a main character.   I found it way too convenient that Bella was able to protect everyone!!!?? And she was more powerful than the old vampires???!!! Wow! I really did not like this story!! I wish I could get my money back!!
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|I found this adaptation to be appallingly bad.<br />I have a strong attachment to the 1995 BBC miniseries, and of course to the actual book.<br /><br />One would think, that in a movie length film, where they must understandably condense the story, that they would make the most of the precious few minutes they DO have to work with.  Instead they choose to botch it up as badly as they can.<br /><br />Kiera Knightley's Lizzy:  Not the respectable Elizabeth Bennet who has for the longest time been my favorite heroine of literature.  She giggles, and lets her chin, collarbone and lips do most of the work.<br /><br />In the marriage proposal which takes place in the rain, (for heightened dramatics I suppose), Mr Darcy defends himself on the spot, rather than saving that dialog for the letter he is supposed to write to her.  After his explanation, Elizabeth goes towards him and nearly kisses him, and the whole time she looks like she is fighting the urge to drag him to bed then and there.<br /><br />When Lydia takes off with Mr Wickham, its effect on the Bennet family is seen as but a minor inconvenience rather than the disgrace it threatens to be in the book.<br /><br />And in the final scene, when Elizabeth is explaining to her father that she does indeed love mr Darcy, she spills the beans about everything he did for her family rather than keep it discreet.<br /><br />And I search in vain in Jane Austen's book for the part where Elizabeth asks Mr Darcy to call her his \\"goddess\\".
B001DP241O|4.0|The great thing about SciFi is that as far as the plot goes, anything goes. I'm not saying we all don't have an imagination, but at least some of us still use it. Goos Show!!
031606792X|5.0|I know others have written that the book was a disappointment, etc. But it was so wonderful for me! I was really depressed after reading Eclipse thinking that Bella would forever be sacrificing her chance to have children with the one she loved. Stephenie Meyer answered all of my needs in this book! I am so glad that Bella got all she could ever want and it was only slightly satisfying to see Bella finally get as irritated with Jacob Black as I have always been! I just love this ending!

B001OST0LW|4.0|This is where the series began to veer off course. After Batman Returns  failed to make the ridiculous amount Warner Bros. hoped it would (it actually did very well), the studio blamed Burton for making it too   dark and violent for the little kiddies. They wanted a lighter Batman that was more family friendy (doesn't that sound stupid?) Well, this is what you get: Cheesy dialogue, sets that are too bright anf flashy for OZ, and a Director who values eye candy (if you can even call it that) over plot. So why did I give this film 4 stars? Two reasons: Jim Carrey and Tommy Lee Jones. The movie is worth seeing for their performances. Also, Chris O Donell is a decent Robin, but I think that story (like most of the Batman saga) will be handled better once they get to it in the current Dark Kmight saga. Warner Bros. got lucky here. There's something worth watching in this film. Unfortunately, the next installment didn't have any redeeming qualities that could save it, and thus Batman died....until 2005, when a much more talented Director showed the world what a Batman movie should be.
B001RPZDY0|4.0|This version of 'Il Travatore' reminds me of the Joan Sutherland/Opera Australia version of the 1970's in its tone, costume and setting. Despite not having Sutherland, I enjoyed this one immensely.<br /><br />Jose Cura, Dmitri Hvorostovsky and Yvonne Naef are excellent in this version. The weakest link, unfortunately, is the Leonora played by Veronica Villarroel. She sings beautifully but not enough to quite sweep you away the rest of the singers do. Act IV, Scene I is just such an example. Manrico in the tower, Leonara singing against the steely white church window background. The music pulses, Manrico tugs at our heart strings but Leonora doesn't bring us up further.<br /><br />Hvorostovsky is excellent in this production. As a baritone, he comes forward, he plays the Count with passion and rage and his performance is strong. Cura is great, strong but my favourite, Yvonne Naef is the real heart of this performance. Her Azucena is passionate, frightening, and sympathetic. The ending is a triumph, perhaps outdoing previous interpretations.<br /><br />If you have seen the Joan Sutherland version I can highly recommend this. The costumes and the use of Schlager Dueling to add realism to the setting, lending depth and darkness to the Count's army gives this production further dimension. Superb, almost excellent but worthy of a purchase.
0790729652|5.0|This is a solid Batman film, but falls short of The Dark Knight legacy of the original comics (thankfully, Christopher Nolan has brought that vision to life).<br /><br />This is Jack Nicholson's best role. He (like Ledger just did) became this role. It suits him. And while he is an entirely different Joker than<br />Ledger, he certainly isn't inferior. This is an adaptation of this Joker<br />as a jolly ringmaster of death, and Nicholson is perfectly cast here.<br />He electrocutes, shoots and poisons Gothamites with a gleeful persona<br />that is simultaneously hilarious and chilling. The viewer almost feels sad once he dies.<br /><br />What doesn't work in this film is Batman himself. Keaton does a decent job, but that doesn't make up for a lack of screen time or a lighter<br />approach to mysterious Batman.
B001K3JF7K|5.0|This album upholds my high opinion of Diana Krall.  It is another wonderful set of songs to listen to and enjoy.  She is my favorite performer.
B000B5XOSO|5.0|This is one of the few sequels that outdose the original. I will say that   none of the villans here are better than Jack Nicholson's Joker (or Heath Ledger's), but they are nonetheless well written, perfectly cast and   amazing to watch. While the villans aren't superior to the one in 1989's Batman, the film as a whole truly is. It fully captures the dark tone that  any Batman film should embrace. Batman Returns is also the only film in the 80's and 90's Batman series that comes even close to being as good as Batman Begins or The Dark Knight. This is also very much a Tim Burton film, and while I'm not a huge fan of most of his other projects, his   penchent for the weird and pecular guides this film to greatness. I have a hard time imagining any other director doing as excellent a job of bringing the Penguin to the screen. This is Tim Burton's masterpiece,   and he should be proud. I can't wait to watch it again!

B001EOOQEM|4.0|The first Black Sabbath album with Ronnie James Dio replacing Ozzy, the band had to come out with something strong. Heaven And Hell delivers, but there is no way around the fact that Ozzy-era Sabbath and Dio-era Sabbath are essentially two different bands. But H&H is my favorite Dio Sabbath album, and should be in the collection of any true Black Sabbath fan. This would be Bill Ward's last work with the band for a long time, but the drumming on the record is still supurb. Highlights include the in-your-face rocker lead off track Neon Knights, Lady Evil, and what used to be all of side two of the album: Wishing Well, Die Young, Walk Away, and Lonely is the Word. OK throw in the classic title track and you have a complete great classic metal album except the one song I don't like that much is Children of the Sea.
0143039881|5.0|In 1960 the Israeli police illegaly abducted the Nazi criminal Adolf Eichmann as he departed a city bus for his trek home. The ensuing trial riveted the world as no other juridical exercise had done since the Nuremburg trials of 1945-46.<br />  In this short work which was originally a series of articles in the New Yorker magazine we see a great intellect at work thinking through the unthinkable overt murder of over six million innocent men, women and children who were slaughtered by Nazi butchers because of the \\"crime\\" of being Jewish.<br />  The author is reporter Dr. Hannah Arendt a native of Hanover, Germany, a brilliant university scholar and a writer of style and substance. Arendt was herself a refugee from Hitler's Germany.<br />  Adolf Eichmann was a Lt. Colonel in the SS whose job was to provide the trains needed to carry the Jews to their murders in Poland and the east. Eichmann was a devoted Nazi whose soul was given to Hiler, SS Chief Himmler and the rest of the Nazi bigwig scum of the earth. He claimed he did his duty because of orders from above and had no personal enmity to the Jews. This is a ludicrous and cruelly insensate argument!<br />  Eichmann was poorly educated though he claimed expertise in Jewish matters. He claimed to be a good negotiator with Jewish Council Ghettos in expediting the removal of Jews to the death camps. Eichmann was a mediocre man who was a cog in the Nazi machine of death. He fed human beings into the maw of the brown shirted beast where death reigned triumphant over humanity for a short but horrific time in history.<br />Eichmann was hanged in Jerusalem for his many crimes. Some claimed he should have been extradited to Germany or free due to the abduction from Argentina. I respond by asking what reprieve did he mete out to his helpless victims!<br />  Arendt was criticized by some Jewish intellectuals who thought she was overly harsh on the Jewish councils. I, however, thank her for this brilliant work showing that people did what they could to survive under the inhuman conditions in which the Third Reich placed them. The Jewish councils gave organization to the death dance through their negotiations with the Nazis.<br />  Hannah Arendt's work is one of the seminal documents in any study of the holocaust. Her work provokes debate and insight which is important in a society where thinking persons should never let their guard down against evil. The banality of Eichmann shows that ordinary people can be enticed into an evil system.

B001EOOQF6|4.0|The 2nd Black Sabbath album featuring Dio, Mob Rules isn't quite as powerful as their previous debut, but if you love Sabbath this should be in your collection. This album is boosted by feverish drumming from   Vinny Appice, who replaced original member Bill Ward.  Appice connected not only with Ronnie, but also and brought out the groove in Tony Iommi. As with the Heaven And Hell album, I like what was side two of the record the most. The guitar solo in Over and Over is among Iommi's best. Slipping Away and Country Girl are also excellent songs. Other highlights include Turn Up The Night and the title track. There's no question Ozzy Sabbath and Dio Sabbath are different bands, but yet in many ways it continues the sound and style. If you want to check out one of the Dio Sabbaths I'd recommend Heaven And Hell first, but if you're a big fan of the band in general this is a classic.

B001GCUO1G|3.0|Neatly tying in and building upon many of the characters in the mutant universe, X-Men Origins: Wolverine will undoubtedly satisfy fans of the franchise. Anyone else needn't apply. Plenty of action scenes find their way into the origin story, and while most are wildly spectacular with inventively insane stunts, certain superpowers lend themselves to rather staid showdowns and the occasional over-the-top confrontation that no amount of belief-suspending tactics can overcome. In its defense though, it is a comic book movie, and we finally get to see a glimpse of some twin mutant girls.<br /><br />One of the most famous X-Men characters, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), receives the full origins treatment, and the latest installment in the series chronicles the harrowing events in the mutant's early years leading up to the first film. The year is 1845, and young James Howlett discovers in a cruel twist of fate the consequences of his temper and the power of his mutant abilities. Swearing to stay by his older brother Victor's (Liev Shreiber) side, James fights through several major wars and the duo wind up more than dishonorably discharged for their failure to respect authority. A way out comes to them in the form of William Stryker (Danny Huston), the leader of a shadowy elite military group carrying out dangerous missions with an army of powerful mutants. When an assignment in Africa sours, the brothers are separated and James, now adopting the name Logan, begins a tranquil new life with girlfriend Kayla (Lynn Collins) as a lumberjack in the Canadian wilderness. But his newfound happiness doesn't last long as Stryker reappears and draws him once again into a world of violence and deception, and Logan must rely on his own cunning, a skeletal upgrade, and the aid of a few new mutant heroes to survive a threat of unimaginable destructive power.<br /><br />The expected staples of blockbuster superhero movies are naturally included, right down to the outlandish fight sequences, pose-striking before and after important battles, slow motion explosions and loud noises galore. Despite all the intense bells and whistles, the generic plot points also find their way into Origins. Brotherly friends find themselves fighting on opposite sides of morality wars, allies hunt down their own kind blindly for a supposed greater good, the villains must create an uncontrollable monster to defeat an even deadlier foe, and innocent victims along with true love stumble into the mess of sacrifices and revenge.<br /><br />Of course the main event is the overload of action sequences sure to numb the senses. But the PG-13 rating puts a brazenly noticeable cap to the violence and bloody realism that could be witnessed when mutants duel with Adamantium claws, swords, and razor-sharp fingernails. Instead, the bloodless fights consist primarily of carefully timed charges like a bull squaring off with a matador, running, yelling and grappling. The cautious attention to avoiding truly bloodthirsty engagement limits creative violence. Even when the hand-to-hand combat looks impressive, the stunts get far-fetched, pushing the special effects to the limit.<br /><br />The mutant super powers are still entertaining, even when they're not specifically defined (Gambit's abilities include a little of everything, although the comics summed it up as the manipulation of kinetic energy), and several new skills get to make a sharp introduction. But perhaps the most fascinating element, the ethical ideas behind living normal lives, concealing inhuman differences, having not asked for such \\"gifts\\" and choosing to exploit them, which made the original X-Men movie trilogy so thought-provoking, never quite makes it into this new Wolverine spectacle.<br /><br />- The Massie Twinsfore and after important battles, slow motion explosions and loud noises galore.

B001K3JF7K|4.0|This new recording by Diana Krall is a mellow mix of bossa nova and some old stadards. It features some fine arrangements, and gives equal opportunity to her singing and piano performance.<br />I highly recommend this as an antidote to life's daily aggravations

In particular, IC always worked so well for me due to truly excellent sequencing and specific use of surprisingly deep instrumentals.
B001IBIQU6|1.0|Unfortunately SOTU is the biggest frustration thrown up by DM to date. Let's pray it won't get worse in the future releases.<br />The sound is so primitive and single-layered you can swear you are listening to a german electronic group from 70's.<br />Martin & Dave must have listened to Kraftwerk a lot prior to the studio sessions. The synths they've used during 80's sounded way updated compared to this effort. Let's pretend that they tried to create a minimalist retro sound influenced by Kraftwerk and / or Bowie's Berlin Trilogy but the songs still lack the beauty of simplicity and depth. In 2000's they couldnt bring up something substantial, to me \\"Ultra\\" was their last best effort.<br />There are some standout tracks, however when it comes to DM one expects way more than a mediocre performance or a few good tracks. As a die-hard fan I hate to write down a review like this but this crap cannot belong to DM, this must be a Goldfrapp record or something.<br />Nothing ventured, nothing gained...

I especially like her take on \\"the Girl from Ipenema\\"--now \\"the Boy from Ipenema\\"--with the extra twist on gender, it is more beautiful than the original. there are a lot of old songs out there that deserve a second look and Donna Krall does a magnificant job!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love The Biggest Loser and I have really have began to like Jillian the past couple of seasons. She's hardcore but she knows her stuff! I began this DVD and it was VERY challenging! But after about a week I completed the entire 20 minutes of Level 1 without having to stop & catch my breath (there's 3 Levels)! It's still very challenging but you have to push yourself through this! I think maybe after another week I will try Level 2. And Jillian is motivating in this DVD more than you would imagine. 5 stars for this DVD!

B001FB4VXU|5.0|Season 1 of this purely genius show really set the tone for what has rapidly become my ultimately favourite sitcom. The show is based around 4 unsociable nerds and their relationship with their socially integrated neighbour, Penny (Kaley Cuoco). The four friends are Leonard (Johnny Galecki), Raj (Kunal Nayyar), Howard (Simon Helberg) and Sheldon (Jim Parsons).<br /><br /> In many of the American sitcoms, there is always the one stand out character that means you watch the show whenever you can as they never fail to make you chuckle. In \\"Friends\\" it was mainly either Chandler or Joey and in \\"Frasier\\", for me it was always Niles. So in Big Bang Theory their stand out character is without a doubt, Sheldon, played by the fantastic Jim Parsons. He is the socially inept but academically gifted and uptight gem of the entire series. From the minute he enters the screen, he owns the show with his uptight ways and the intelligence with which he delivers his lines.<br /><br />During the course of Season 1, the relationship between Leonard and Penny was explored as a way of removing it from any future possibility allowing the characters to be focused on in more personal detail. In Season 2 we are treated to a number of excellent treats including Leonards mother coming to visit, Sheldon trying to become more sociable by creating a friendship algorithm and trying to get a grip on sarcasm.<br /><br />Out of the entire second season, I have two favourite episodes that I can watch again and again, and it's thanks to the genius of the Sheldon character. \\"The Bath Item Gift Hypothesis\\" is just genius and perfectly encapsulates the character of Sheldon into one brilliant episode. Penny buys Sheldon a Christmas gift and now has an obligation to buy her a gift of equal monetary value. Alternatively, Leonard meets his intellectual superior who enters into a relationship with Penny, leaving Leonard a bit on the jealous side. The exchanging of gifts is the truly splendid moment of the episode as the gift Penny has bought for Sheldon is a used napkin signed by Leonard Nimoy (Spock); the reaction has to be witnessed.<br /><br />\\"The Maternal Capacitance\\" is also another stunning episode and is purely down to the introduction of a new Sheldon-esque character; Leonard's Mother (Christine Baranski). She's a psychiatrist completely detached from any emotional feelings and around others is emotionally and socially awkward. Sheldon on the other hand appears completely comfortable around her and as she's alienating everybody else; she gets on swimmingly with Sheldon. This is a character I would want to see more of in the future as her initial appearance was divinely hysterical.<br /><br />A season of belly laughs that leaves an opening for a promising third and fourth season and any fan should own this set upon its release.bought for Sheldon is a used napkin signed by Leonard Nimoy (Spock); the reaction has to be witnessed.    \\"The Maternal Capacitance\\" is also another stunning episode and is purely down to the introduction of a new Sheldon-esque character; Leonard's Mother (Christine Baranski).

One of Jerry Bagger trying to bag Annabelle who conned him badly. The other brings Oliver Stone's intricate, dark past to light.<br />The book is thoroughly entertaining & will certainly hold your interest.<br />Mr. Baldacci's choice of Harry Finn as a new character was a good one.

B0015DWJX2|5.0|The book was a wonderful surprise and a joy to read.  I hated for it to end.  I would never have thought that reading a book of letters could be so entertaining and touching.  Surprisingly the story and characters are well developed through the letters and you find yourself caring about them and looking forward to their next letter. It is also interesting how the letters create the past and bring you into the present.  I look forward to more from this author.  This is another book that I probably would have missed if not for my Kindle.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|Probably the best non-Japanese animated movie in several years, Wall-E delivers on so many levels.  I actually had high hopes for this one, expecting it to be cute and funny, and those hopes were not only met but surpassed.  The surprise though was how great it was in other areas at the same time - a touching love story, an epic futuristic odyssey/adventure, and - despite the wonderfully cute, whimsical nature of its animation style - a surprisingly unsettling and plausible-feeling look at the future of the world and all that once lived on it.      It's centuries after a total envirornmental breakdown has left the Earth uninhabitable amd humanity retreated to deep space, leaving behind legions of clean-up robots to try and repair the damage and eventually pave the way for humans to come back to a reinvigorated planet.  Wall-E is apparantly the only such robot left functioning - we see rusted derelicts of similar robots that presumably broke down ages ago - and his only companion is a small cricket he's found and keeps as a pet.  During the day Wall-E continues going on about his assigned chores, pausing to collect trinkets and gadgets that amuse him from the ruins, and at night he retreats to the home he's made himself inside an old metal bunker, where he carefully stores his collections and even watches old human movies he's managed to scavenge. This has been the lovable little robot's life for a llong time, when two new events change the balance of things.  The first is Wall-E's discovery of an actual live, growing plant amidst the ruins of mankind's old cities - evidently the first plant found in a long time; the second is the arrival of one of the robot-manned probes the human race set up to return to Earth periodically and assess its currently livability.     The machine that emerges from this ship is a female robot named EVE (like WALL-E, an acronym, but we'll call her Eve for short), the first new robot friend Wall-E's had a chance to make in eons.  Although the pair gets off to a rocky start (Eve's line of robots comes armed, and Eve herself is rather trigger-happy), a beautiful little relationship begins to form as Eve goes about her assesment and Wall-E shows her around and shelters her in his little bunker.  The robots talk in this movie, but its mostly in strange little noises and sound effects, and only occasionally can we make out a word.  Oddly though there's no difficulty at all in understanding them, even during scenes where a single robot is alone for long periods of time.  And despite the fact that they're metal robots, the body language and yes, even facial expressions (often on robots who don't at first glance appear to really Have faces, per se) conveys tonnes of feeling - not in an exxagerated, bug-out way, but in subtle and very affecting ways.  Heck, even the cricket conveys a lot through body language.      When Eve's probe returns for her and the plant is discovered, a series of pre-programmed protocols spring into effect, as the vessel takes the plant as evidence and rockets off toward man's new home way out deep in the solar system, around Saturn.  Wall-E and Eve are along for the ride, and Wall-E encounters what's become of human civilization as it floats out in space waiting for a return home that was supposed to have come centuries earlier.      This is when the movie starts twisting in some unexpected directions, and since we're already at around the half-way point, I won't say too much more specific.  It never falters for one moment though.  Full to brimming with adventure, awesome animated visuals, humor, romance, and a surprisingly deep exploration of a possible future, the movie is an unmitigated success on many levels and definately one of 2008's best.  Incredible ending, by the way.       A couple of animated shorts come included with the movie.  'BURN-E' takes a robot who was seen very briefly in the movie (one of the robots on the automated human ship out by Saturn) and gives him a starring role in his own short feature, seamlessly combining brief scenes from the movie with new footage to tell a tale of the little maintenance robot.  It's a great little work in its own right and also serves to fill out the larger story even more.  The other, 'Presto', is about a stage magician and his rabbit.  It has nothing whatsoever to do with the Wall-E story but is definately worth including - it's hilarious.  You know, if you take the top two dozen (in North American box office terms) comedy movies of any given recent year, then take out the four or five Best, all the remaining twenty or so may well not have as much laughs as that one little (maybe seven minutes?) short, Presto.  It's pure comedic magic.  And both these shorts make the Wall-E movie even more indispensible.

B00006DEF9|5.0|Who doesn't know the words to the song `Singin' in the Rain'?  I mean, seriously, even if you have yet to see the movie I'm sure you could sing that song word for word right now.<br /><br />Go ahead; I'll wait.<br /><br />The thing is that I too had never seen this movie yet knew all those words and it made me question just why it was that I never sat down to watch this beloved musical.  I am not really a huge musical lover, but then again, I've never been one to disregard a movie because of genre before.  I'll watch anything at least once.  So, when this came on TCM a few months ago I just had to watch it.  I got everything ready for `movie night' (the drinks, the friends, the snacks) and I settled in to watch what has steadily been considered one of the top ten movies of all time.<br /><br />I loved it!<br /><br />Everything about this movie fits so perfectly into one another.  The music is divine, the performances are stellar, the set pieces are delicious and the script is fun, fresh and wholly entertaining.  There is not a single misstep here.  It's not the best movie of all time, but it works magic with every fiber of its being.<br /><br />The film tells of film star Don Lockwood as he struggles to transition himself from `silent' film star to `talkie' film star.  His frequent costar and rumored lover Lina Lamont is a selfish and spoiled diva whose voice is just not suited for film, so a young and talented singer named Kathy Selden is hired to dub her voice for their upcoming film.  When Don falls in love with Kathy things get out of hand.  Lina is furious and it becomes apparent that their love affair could sink the whole picture.<br /><br />Gene Kelly and Donald O'Connor make a wonderful team here, feeding off each others energy to create some of the most impressive and widely acclaimed dance numbers in musical history.  Solo they are spectacular, but together they are even better; and what is so awesome is that when Debbie Reynolds (who is so refreshingly spunky here) jumps in she makes the perfect pair into a vibrant threesome.  The real scene stealer though is Jean Hagen.  She may not sing or dance but she acts her tail off, delivering an iconic comedic performance that will have you rolling in your seats.<br /><br />I haven't had this much fun watching a movie in a long time (I tend to prefer the dramatic and depressing films, so this was a nice change of pace).  I've since seen the film again and loved it just as much if not more the second time around.  This is a film designed to make you smile, and is succeeds at doing just that.ir into a vibrant threesome.  The real scene stealer though is Jean Hagen.

Her plan: to spend four months in each of Italy (to experience pleasure), India (to explore spirituality), and Bali (to find life balance).<br /><br />The premise of this \\"memoir of self-discovery\\" is a fascinating idea, but Gilbert moans throughout of the terribly hard times that she endured that precipitated the trip.<br /><br />Give it up, Liz. Lots of women have found themselves suffering through divorce, depression & failed affairs. Many have had children in tow. Most have not had the luxury to quit their jobs & travel self-absorbedly for a year.<br /><br />That being said, Gilbert does write with grace and humor and provides a fascinating chronicle of the details of her journey. She is a professional wordsmith who writes with wit and warmth. She deftly shares the emotions that lie at the core of her experience. Although I found the entire experiment to be extravagant and self-indulgent, I do think that Eat, Pray, Love is a thought-provoking read.

B001GCUO1G|2.0|\\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\", written by David Benioff and directed by Gavin Hood.<br /><br />The world is familiar with Wolverine as his antics have been displayed in the 3 X-men movies but now it is time to examine his origins. Not too much story to elaborate on; Witness marvels favorite mutant from the very beginning and get Hollywood's take on his relationship with Sabretooth, his first love, his war adventures all the way up to just before the first X-Men movie...<br /><br />What an abortion of a great character. How did Marvel let this happen? With the success of Spiderman, and Iron Man and a great comeback with a much better Hulk Sequel, how did this movie get made? I have been a huge fan of this character for over 20 years now and I really really wanted this to be good but instead saw the most disappointing comic movie adaptation yet.<br /><br />The Good: Trying to find some but have yet to be successful.<br /><br />The Bad: Why did they have to make a campy Wolverine movie? Wolverine is one of the darkest Marvel characters and his movie is full of camp, how does that make sense? Why did they turn one of the hardest Marvel characters into a compassionate crying machine? How did a movie with the Marvel stamp on it come out looking so cheap? When did Gambit turn into a nice guy? Have CG effects gotten worse cause they looked pretty bad in this. Why are there so many forced attempts at iconic shots? I could go on an on.<br /><br />Overall: This has to be the worst Marvel movie to date and the furthest off the mark with regards to the original source material. The movie looks bad and was written worse. My favorite character has been watered down and then had cool aid added to him. Absolutely terrible and unforgivable.
B001AQO46E|5.0|I agree one hundred percent with MrChuck...get this on bluray FOX, stat!!! This is undoubtedly the best Arnie flick of the 90's, after T2, and all we fans have to show for it is an awful non-enhanced DVD.

B000W91RUG|5.0|Jim Parsons steals the show in this Chuck Lorrie comedy. His character of Sheldon is one of the most out of touch people you will every meet. Sheldon lives in his own little world of being the smartest man in the world who simply can't understand why other people aren't as smart as he is nor does he care to try and lower himself so he can understand.    The rest of the cast is also great and only improve what Parsons does with Sheldon.    There are endless references to science fiction movies, books and comics and anyone who loves these mediums will enjoy this show.

B001TH16DS|5.0|Star Trek fans are an amazing bunch.  The tone of many negative posts seems to center on price vs entertainment value.  The current street price for this 7 BD-50 disc set is $65. That's well under $10/disc.  You receive both video and audio that is easily the best this series has ever looked or sounded.  The option of the CGI and enhanced sound are entertaining, and you can always choose to view the unaltered, original effects versions, which still look great.  The color saturation, facial detail etc is excellent for any program that was fist done in the '60s.  I watched the original broadcasts (I'm old) and the beauty of these BD discs is stunning by comparison.    If you own, as I do, DVD versions of Season 1, I suggest there is no comparison to these Blus when viewed on a 1080p screen.  If $65 is too much for this set, then ANY disc, of any entertainment, standard or Blu, is over-priced.    This is an excellent product, bargain priced and satisfying in every way. Whether you choose to buy this set, or not, it represents technology advancing the enjoyment of the Star Trek franchise.  Fans can only hope the BD version of the films is this great.    So buy it, already!
B001GQACGO|5.0|i think this album is beautiful. it's soulful and fun at the same time. the beyonce cd probably wont produce too many singles after halo but i could be wrong. the sasha cd is full of hits. radio, sweet dreams, and it sounds like video phone is after diva. if u like beyonce you'll like this album.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I didn't want to watch it. Yes, the commercials looked funny. Yes, I like Nathan Fillion. Yes, I like procedural cops shows. I didn't want to commit! I already watch DWTS and Criminal Minds. And I don't like watching after 9PM. But, my hubby downloaded the first three episodes and now my mom and I are hooked.<br /><br />It's smart, funny, well written and just plain entertaining. In a remarkable twist, the didn't save all the funny stuff just for the commercials.  We laughed out loud. We were surprised. The bad guys didn't have big red \\"v\\" for villain on their foreheads. The female detective is intelligent and capable. The author is egotistical, rich, but also insightful,intelligent and...a loving father. Woh. The supporting characters are strong (his daughter and mother are great assets). It has everything going for it. I have season one on my wishlist.<br /><br />So naturally, now that we are hooked, they will probably cancel it. I hate TVv.<br /><br />UPDATE:  Woohoo!  They have renewed the show, so the little cliffhanger from the last episode may now be explored.  Well worth watching and highly recommended!  And though I'm pathetic and old beyond my years - I will stay up until 11 to see new episodes.

B000A6T1JU|4.0|The Warriors ranks as one of the classics to me.  Everything about the movie is just great, from the brawls to the cold stares that Swan gives just about everyone.    Personally, I prefer the regular version to the Ultimate Director's Cut, because the comic-style transitions greatly disrupt the flow of the movie and at one point, completely remove any sense of surprise that the scene would've had.  Get the original version if you can, it clearly deserves 5 stars.
B001UREJWM|4.0|It is somewhat scary when rock legends go back into the studio to record a new album after a long hiatus. They may sound old or outdated and this kills the thrill for the fans. In this case Heaven and Hell sound both modern and relevant for a band with such members and history in the metal world. The music is slow pounding heavy metal with no excuses. Production is top notch and the music has a uniqueness while sounding familiar due to the individual and recognizable contributions of each band member. It is a nice addition to the Dio/Sabbath catalog.
B000I0QKDS|4.0|The LP version of this album suffered somewhat from ordinary production values. I have distinct recollections of craning into the speakers to hear what Jeff's guitar was doing on a number of tracks. This has been fixed with this re-mastered version and you can hear every slide of Jeff's fingers.<br /><br />The bonus tracks should sate any curiosity about Jeff's early solo singles but there's nothing really outstanding there. Still, the original album tracks are superb. Let Me Love You in particular features spectacular playing well ahead of its time. Bolero has lost nothing and the cover version of the Yardbirds' Shapes of Things showcases the capability of this lineup, featuring as it does Ronnie Wood on bass, Mickey Waller on drums and Rod Stewart on vocals.<br /><br />I had to have it, and now I have to keep playing it.
0316017922|5.0|Outliers is an entertaining, light read written in classic Gladwell style.  His writing is beautiful.  The words flow effortlessly and are a joy to read.  The style is casual and narrative, yet constructed with precision.  In this book, just as Gladwell does with all of his writing, he strings together seemingly unrelated anecdotes and academic results with a common theme.  In Outliers, the theme is that success is determined less by internal factors (such as talent, intelligence, and ambition) and more by external factors (such as practice, culture, and luck).<br /><br />While I found Outliers to be fascinating and thoroughly entertaining, I caution readers to not take the content too seriously.  The argument is not terribly compelling, because Gladwell's style is more akin to story telling than persuasion.  I sense that the author begins with a collection of captivating stories and then tries to find a common theme, rather than beginning with a theory to prove or disprove.  The content is sufficient for conversational fodder and to spark curiosity, but not for any serious debate on the determinants of success.  After all, the author is a writer and not a social scientist.  He conveys results from the world of social science research in a way that is accessible to a mass audience.<br /><br />Unfortunately, I think the title Outliers was a bad choice.  The sub-title The Story of Success is much more appropriate.  Some of the people he discusses unambiguously fit the description of outlier, such as Bill Gates, but other people do not.  Nevertheless, they all fit under the description of successful.<br /><br />If you have enjoyed Malcolm Gladwell's previous literary pieces, then you must read this one as well; the conclusion of this book is particularly endearing.  If you are looking for a compelling, scientific, or robust argument on the determinants of success, then this book may not be for you.
B000B8QG4A|5.0|No problems with this order. The movie arrived on time and in wonderful condition.    Thanks!
0060254920|5.0|My children enjoyed this book when they were small. They named all the monsters, created plots and sub-plots and literally wore it out. I purchased this one for my grandchildren and hope they enjoy it as much. This is a great book to stimulate imagination and flights of fancy. I highly recommend it.
B001PPGAK8|4.0|The film:  After re-watching X2:X-Men United, I felt compelled to re-watch \\"The Last Stand,\\" since I only saw it once, in its theatrical run. I did not like the movie too much the first time through, and you can only see a movie for the first time once, so it left a sour feeling in my mind. Well, I bought the movie on Blu-Ray, and I gotta say... the feeling is still there, it's just a little better. The movie picks up right after X2 ended, with Cyclops still grieving over the death of Jean-Grey, Logan is still the smart-aleck \\"substitute\\" teacher, and Professor X is having these mental issues that lead back to a little girl from 20 years ago. To say that Bryan Singer is missed is an under statement, for a lot of the issues and themes from the old films don't resonate as much. The acting is still good, but what really hit some of those sour notes were the liberties they took with the characters. As a fan of the old animated series and some of the later comic books, it was rather dissapointing to see some of the characters go, and some to not come back at all.(Nightcrawler, anyone?) Another one of my issues was how the closure was handled. To, me it was flat and lifeless. For example, when Pyro and Iceman had their duel, Iceman headbutts Pyro and that is it. You don't see anymore of his character. Closure like this makes me feel unhappy, at least compared to the prior films. Also, what was up with the mutant that was the cure? Other than that plot device, he had no other role in the film. He could've been substituted by a cow, and it wouldn't have made a difference. The action was great, and the special effects snazzy, but overall, it was an average flick. Oh, well. Here's hoping \\"Origins\\" hits the right spots.  The Blu-Ray:  No complains here. The video is definitely top notch. It's very minimally grainy, though its natural, retaining the film look and feel. Colors are spot-on, contrast is never blown out (though a little too bright during the white room scenes withthe \\"cure\\" mutant) and blacks are deep. Great video!  The audio is also a heart-stopper. The DTS HD Mix on this disc is a heavy-hitter, with some deep, low bass and great directionality, never having any issues with dialogue. This is a truly worthy mix. Great demo material indeed!  So, I give it a four star rating instead of a three because of the great production values of the Disc. Otherwise, the film stays at a three out of five.
B001P9KR8U|5.0|This was one of the best movies I've seen in a LONG time.  It's well worth the investment to buy and not rent as you'll want to see it over and over again!
0807014273|4.0|This is an important book if you are interested in human psychology, particularly in logotherapy. The book consists of three parts, the first is Dr. Frankls personal account of his survival at Auschwitz and other concentration camps. In the second part the author gives a concise summary of logotherapy (Def: It focuses on the meaning of the human existence and assists its patients to find meaning in their life.) and in the third and last chapter Frankl discusses \\"Tragic Optimism\\" and its usefulness.<br /><br />I found Dr. Frankls account of his time in Auschwitz very interesting, yet not as emotionally moving as accounts by other authors. I believe that's because the author focused his writings on the psychological aspect of the whole experience, thus giving it a more clinical and detached feeling. This actually proved to be helpful to the reader in understanding the theories of logotherapy.<br /><br />There were some really good insights in this book and I would like to quote the ones that I found to be most important:<br /><br />\\"Don't aim at success- the more you aim at it and make it a target, the more you are going to miss it. For success, like happiness, cannot be pursued; it must ensue, and it only does so as the unintended side-effect of one's dedication or a cause greater than oneself or as a by-product of one's surrender to a person other than oneself. Happiness must happen, and the same holds for success: you have to let it happen by not caring about it.\\"<br /><br />\\"Live as if you were living already for the second time and as if you had acted the first time as wrongly as you are about to act now!\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the meaning of life and how to live a meaningful life.

0374531269|4.0|I listened to the audio book version of \\"A long way gone\\" and found it a very interesting and worthwhile listening experience.<br /><br />The author Ishmael Beah shares his traumatic experience of surviving the civil war in Sierra Leone. He had a normal childhood until his village got attacked by rebels and all of his family got displaced. After seeing a lot of horrific scenes and coming very close to death Ishmael finally finds his family in a far away village but before their reunion the rebels attack once more, this time killing the whole village including the authors family. After this Ishmael is changed forever and eventually joins up with the army as a child soldier to ensure his own survival. It's heartbreaking to see how a basically good kid is turned into a killer by his environment.<br />Thankfully Ismael gets a second chance and is selected for a rehabilitation program that helps him to become a child again. Unfortunately the war catches up with him once more. But instead of turning into a soldier again he decides to flea to America. To my disappointment this was where the story left off. I would have really liked to hear more about how he actually made it to the States and what life was like for him in the new and strange place.<br /><br />Overall, a good read and I would recommend it.
B001ILFUDM|5.0|This is a top notch piece of software for anyone's BD catalog.  This movie is quite beautiful and it is a piece of cinematic history being the 2nd Disney film behind Snow White.    Picture:  Being that the animation standards for the 30s are very different from today's the animation in this film is superlative.  The color palates are great and it really jumps off the screen in 1080p.  Just as I was amazed with Sleeping Beauty on BD this is another great movie that they restored beautifully.  I always remember this being longer but it was really good to see it again.      For the people that complain about the aspect ratio 4:3, Disney went so far as to get a great artist (can't remember his name off the top of my head) to fill in the black bars on the sides of the picture with art related to the current scene so it looks very showcase like and doesn't take away from the show at all.    Sound:  There are few companies out there that are using the best codec's for sound with their BD releases.  Lionsgate and Disney are the two that really stand out to me.      7.1 DTS-HD MA is beautiful and if you have a decoder (receiver) and the speakers to do it I would recommend nothing less than listening to it this way.  You can hear everything and it just makes this movie that much better.      For the purists the original score and soundtrack are still on the disk and you can watch it that way too.      Special Features:  There are a ton of features here about how it was made, the restoration, alternate endings (sketch art) and a lot of others.  If you really want to sit down and learn about how this classic was made they will explain it to you.  It even talks about Disney's editing process and how he analyzed every single aspect of this movie to put out his best product.  It probably drove everyone crazy that worked on this but when you aren't the boss what can you really do.    Overall:  This is a great value here on Amazon because you should pay the [...] bucks at least forthis.  I am glad I ordered this and I will continue to support Disney if they keep remaking the classics like this one.  I can't wait for Snow White on BD.  That is going to be sweet!    -fin
B001GCUO1G|5.0|I just got back from the movie and let me tell you that although it isn't entirely faithful to the comic books, it is still one heck of a thrilling ride. Now I am not going to post any real spoilers, although I will tell you a bit about the movie.<br /><br />The opening sequence is short but really to the point and quickly explains the relationship between James Howlett (Wolverine/Logan) and Victor Creed (Sabretooth/Logan's older brother) and how James was treated kindly and with love by both his mother and father, while Victor was left under the care of his abusive alcoholic father with no mother whatsoever. This all plays out during the 1840's.<br /><br />After a particularly violent episode, James and Victor leave their respective homes together and proceed to look out for each other as they participate in every major war from the Civil War, World War I, World War II, and the Vietnam War. A particularly funny scene takes place when both James and Victor are sentenced to die by firing squad after Victor kills a superior officer who attempts to stop him from raping and killing a Vietnamese girl.<br /><br />Things really start progressing from this point and it would truly be remiss of me to give you too many details, but I will give you a bit more about some of the characters.<br /><br />Now some reviewers have been a bit harsh about Liev Schreiber playing the role of Victor Creed/Sabretooth because he doesn't look anything like the comic book version. Well let me assure you that even though he may not look like him, he does and outstanding job of portraying him. Unlike Taylor Mane who did really look like the comic book version, but unfortunately he didn't really fulfill the part at all in the first [[ASIN:B000AYELVA X-Men (Widescreen Edition)]] movie.<br /><br />Ryan Reynolds on the other hand did an outstanding job, as always, playing Deadpool. Reynolds since of humor and delivery has always been enjoyable ever since I seen him in [[ASIN:B000ICLRG6 National Lampoon's Van Wilder - Unrated (Two-Disc Special Edition)]] and later in [[ASIN:B0007V6ITE Blade - Trinity (New Line Platinum Series)]], although that movie really needed some help.<br /><br />I didn't much care for the performance of William Stryker, and I thought that the actor who portrayed him in [[ASIN:B0000BWVCM X2 - X-Men United (Two-Disc Widescreen Edition)]] did a much better job. However, a lot of the character actors throughout the film did a great job. Especially be on the lookout for the performance of the old farmer.<br /><br />We also get a chance to see Fred Dukes a.k.a. The Blob, John Wraith, Emma Frost (although I really don't like how they portrayed her), and of course the \\"ragin' cajun\\" himself, Gambit. Which I felt was portrayed rather well. I also rather enjoyed the appearance of a younger Scott Summers/Cyclops and his sudden realization of his powers.<br /><br />I only had two HUGE complaints with this movie and actually considered giving it a much lower ranking because of it, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it because I am such a fan and really had been anxiously awaiting the release of this movie, along with everyone else I might add.<br /><br />1. I really didn't like the way the director and writers presented Logan's memory loss and thought that they really should have stuck to the original method presented in the comic books.<br /><br />2. The character of Wolverine, as he was portrayed in this movie, was way too wimpy and whiney for my taste. I mean really, all these claws and swords flashing around and through human bodies and yet not a single drop of blood anywhere? They're bone, metal, and fingernail type claws, not lightsabers which cauterize the wounds as they go through them. What's up with that?<br /><br />3. To do this movie justice, it should have been rated R and really shown a vicious and brutal pre-X-Men Wolverine and stayed true to his character. But that is just mine and several million others opinion. What do we know, we are just the fans.<br /><br />Other than that, I really did enjoy the movie. Or did I just enjoy it so much because I am such a HUGE fan and wanted it to be good? I don't know, go to the movie yourself and you be the judge.<br /><br />Now a bit of friendly non-spoiler advice;<br /><br />1. Look for a special guest cameo from a very famous and powerful mutant.<br /><br />2. Don't leave the theater right after the end of the movie.<br /><br />3.

B001N18HOQ|5.0|This is one of the best records made in the last 20 years easily.  Rock had gotten very watered down with the entire \\"hair metal band\\" thing that was very big and then Seattle just exploded with the grunge movement.  The funny thing is Pearl Jam isn't grunge but they got lumped in with it.  They are more just straight rock/blues.  They are great at what they do.      Nirvana, Alice in Chains, Soundgarden, Sonic Youth and Pearl Jam were pretty much the biggest bands up there at the time.  Pearl Jam is really the only band that lasted (sonic youth is good but.....they aren't PJ.)    This album was a huge influence on me when I was in high school and I listen to it today but when I heard they re-mastered it and released the MTV Unplugged with it I had to get this album again.      The original is unchanged and still as beautiful as ever as you can hear a lot of the imperfections of their playing as it was so raw back then.  Now that they have been playing for so many years they have gotten their catalog of music down to a science which is good but mistakes in playing and playing through them are what makes bands great to me.    The re-mastered version is slightly different in that a lot more of the instruments feel like they are up front more.  You can still hear Eddie sing and he isn't drowned out by any means but I prefer the original.  I understand that Brendan O'Brien didn't want to mess with this classic but the guys had a lot of faith in him to remix it differently.  It isn't bad but I have always been the guy that says don't mess with perfection.    If you like PJ you have to get this album, if you like music and don't own Ten you need to be slapped then you need to go buy this version as it has the both versions on it.  Nuff said.......    -fin

0930289234|2.0|I will admit that I missed out on Watchmen when it was first released.  But with the film adaptation finally here and all of the chatter about how important and superb the graphic novel is, I decided that it was time to see what all of the fuss is about.  As it turns out, it's not that much.<br /><br />First of all, I do not frowm upon comic books or graphic novels and dismiss them as inferior to other works of fiction.  I have a small comic collection from when I was younger, but I never really got into the whole comic scene that much.  That being said, I appreciate a great work of fiction regardless of what genre it comes from.  It's just that Watchmen isn't all that great.<br /><br />Watchmen is innovative, all right.  It took the graphic novel to a whole new level proving that the genre could be artistically significant.  Its characters are very human, despite their superhero backgrounds.  It takes on ambitious and complex themes and stays grounded firmly in reality.  It taps into 1980's cold war paranoia and is bleak as all get out.<br /><br />Yet I suspect that many critics and fans have placed the novel's innovativeness and landmark qualities in front of it's actual entertainment value.  That happens quite often with works of art.  Is it too much to ask for something that breaks new ground to also be fantastically entertaining?<br /><br />The plot of Watchmen, which deals with costumed crimefighters who have been ostracized by society, is bogged down by too many characters and too many themes.  It feels a bit overwhelming and largely unsatisyging at the same time.  None of the characters feel real.  It seems that Moore has worked extremely hard to force them to be three dimensional and complex.  Each of them feels too plotted out, their motives and actions dictated by the writer.  The result is a collection of characters who never really feel real or emotinoally accessible.  It's all too neat and tidy, despite the fact that everything is supposed to be messy and complicated.<br /><br />Still, it's not terrible.  I admire the ambition and I appreciate what it did for the graphic novel as an art form.  I just wish it was a truly engrossing experience...a work of fiction to get lost in rather than to observe through the prism of its artistic significance.and complicated.<br /><br />Still, it's not terrible.

141690977X|2.0|Greg Behrendt has written a great guide for a girl who'd like to woo and marry him.  The guide is probably also useful for men similar to him.  However, not all men are cast in one mold!  If all women followed his advice, there would be a lot of unhappy singles walking around.<br /><br />Greg advises women to drop men who treat them poorly.  OK, this is good advice.<br /><br />However, among Greg's strictures: never ask a guy out, never call a guy first, etc., etc.  Basically, he is very opposed to a female making the first move.  This is ridiculous for two reasons.  First, many shy men would find themselves in a bad spot, as well as women who are partial to shy men.  Secondly, in this modern day and age, his book simply perpetuates gender roles which are no longer meaningful to a large portion of society.<br /><br />Greg defines relationships with rules and games rather than understanding and communication.
B001FEA9QU|1.0|Sorry folks, I am a big fan of metallica but this album is by far the worst trash I have heard from them. In my hay days, Metallica was the avantgarde of metal rock. Every subsequent album represented a renewed rigor of how glorious metal rock can be. Today I heard everything the opposite of what i've experienced in the past.<br /><br />I feel as though Metallica is riding on their name and lost their passion for creativity. It especially struck a cord with me when I saw \\"the unforgiving III\\" on the album...really are you serious?...u can't come up with something new? so lets remix an old fan favorite and hope they'll bite...ahh NO, it sucks. If it was good, fine, but it's not.<br /><br />My review of this album is not solely based on the unforgiven song but the entire album.  Every song contain lyrics and the instrumental work that is dull and lacking connection with yesterday's and today's fans.<br /><br />Thanks to technological innovation that they so despised, we can now listen to some of the music -in this case, crap- before our decision to purchase their music.<br /><br />Metallica, this is your wakeup call! Retire or be the rockstars that you are. Make us proud again.<br /><br />Your fan.<br /><br />Ironically, the magnetic coffen on your album cover seems to insinuate the direction of your music career...no pun intended.
B001TK3XO0|5.0|This book is simply amazing.     Think of it like the Titanic, the way it told the story of two soon to be lovers while interweaving it with the history of the great ship...     A Thousand Splendid Suns is so rich, in-depth and it's characters twirl around the real events.     This is the type of story that makes you want to stop after few chapters just so you can take a breather, cry, laugh, or fume in outrage before you can pick it up and keep reading, (and it WILL keep you reading).     Great book, i completely recommend it for anyone who loves fictional stories based on historical facts.

0375842209|5.0|I just finished this book last night staying up later than normal because I just could not put it down. I'm the type of reader who finishes everything they start and, I have to admit when I began this book, I wasn't sure I was going to be able to continue no less finish it.  Thank goodness I plowed on because after thirty pages or so, I was hooked.  Like many other reviewers have commented, I don't understand why there is a \\"young\\" adult sticker right on the front of the book.  I think that's poor marketing and, if it wasn't for word of mouth, the average \\"old\\" adult reader would not be purchasing this book. Be that as it may, I'm just thankful that so many reviewers here raved about it enough to pique my interest.<br /><br />There's so much that can be said about this book but the common denominator will always be \\"words\\".  The main character is a little girl named Liesel (Zusak giving her a pretty name which conflicts with the atmosphere of the book) and right away he adds something to the experience by this word.  In a world of war and bombing and fear, we have the word \\"Liesel\\" to even things out and give the reader some pleasure every time they say her name.  Like the bombs falling on Germany, Liesel is dropped off at the home of the Hubermann's who will become her foster parents. The foster mother Rosa is a big mouth and someone to be feared if it weren't for the fact that she has a huge heart. The foster father Hans is the kind of father every girl should have and it is he who teaches Liesel how to read.  Her love of reading and her love of \\"words\\" will get her through one of the hardest times in German history.<br /><br />Showing another side of Nazi Germany, Zusak relates how it wasn't only the Jews who died at the hands of Hitler. There were also so many Germans who died because of this monster.  They either had to join the Nazi party or get taken away with the Jews.  Those who weren't taken away had to face the bombing of their towns by the Allied forces. At a time when Hitler was destroying people with his words, Liesel found a way of saving them with hers.  She learned from Max, a Jew they were hiding in their basement, how to steal these words back from the \\"Fuhrer\\" and just how powerful this could be.<br /><br />To say she was a thief is really stretching it but her obsession with the written word forced her to covet any book she could get her hands on.  The goodness of an unexpected woman brings something into Liesel's life that no one else could......a world full of words right at her fingertips.<br /><br />The most unusual part of the book is the narrator \\"Death\\" which might turn the reader off at the onset.  But deep into the book, you almost come to love this character and how gently he lifts the souls out of the dying bodies with such care and love.  As the saying goes, \\"Death waits for no man\\" but this narrator did wait until they were ready to come to him.  As you can imagine, this was a very busy time for death himself as war and death are best friends. The narrator (death) explains that war is like the boss at your shoulder wanting more and more until death (the character) becomes very weary.  It's almost funny to think of death as a character in this book but you come to forget that he's not real.....or perhaps he's more real than life itself.<br /><br />I could go on and on about The Book Thief.  It's one I won't soon forget and I encourage you to read it no matter what your age.  And a note to the publisher....take that stupid \\"young adult\\" sticker off the cover!!!Hitler was destroying people with his words, Liesel found a way of saving them with hers.

B001PPLIEG|5.0|When I first saw this in the theater, I wasn't that impressed.  I think that Casino Royale was one of the best Bond movies in a long, long time.  It was a true Bond to the books, not the Hollywood Hype.    However, when I re-watched it at home, I liked it a lot.  It is not as true to the books as Casino Royale, but pretty close.  There is a lot of action, but it is not a straight action movie like the Brosnan stuff was.    It has a little of the Bond charm, intrigue and flow.    It was nice to see.
B001GZ6QC4|5.0|Before I ewven saw this movie, there was a lot of hype on it, a lot of it having to do with Heath Ledger I believe. Nowe I love Batman, I feel he's the greatest comic book superhero of all time, but even I was wondering \\"Whats the big deal? Its just a movie?\\" But after watching it of coarse I have since reversed my opinion. It defiantely deserved the hype it got! And Heath Ledgers performance as the joker was legendary. Previously, Jack Nicholson had played the joker...but Heath Ledgers joker made Jacks joker look like a Disney character. I'm talking seriously creepy. I actually had chills and goosebumps watching it. And Christian Bale did a wonderful job playing Batman, as usual. The entire movie was expertly done..though I did find the first 20 mins. or so to be a bit slow, but it was necessary to understand the rest of the movie. Overall, if your a fan of Batman..then this movie is a must have. It really leaves you on the edge of your seat.I highly recommend it.
0440244870|4.0|This was quite entertaining! A silly way to spend the morning, I suppose. But, it was fun. I was surprised that the central romance unwound so slowly! It took nearly the entire novel!! And I am very curious about how this one book was expanded into a five book series! Not to mention the film... from the previews it doesn't seem like it is that tight of an adaptation. Still, I am curious about the other four books, as well as the movie! This was really light-hearted and certainly a fast, fluffy read!
B001PPLIEG|4.0|I enjoyed this 007. You can see that they political landscape is shifting and the enemy is the Quantum instead of Smersh. The Tri-Lateral Commission duping the world and the stupid governments allowing it but for this one man. A bit far fetched but that is 007.
B001PPLJIQ|3.0|I did not particularly like the story that this film tells but the acting is great.  Kate Winslet's character befriends a teenage boy when he becomes ill with scarlet fever.  The boy falls in love with her and later when he is in college, he sits in on her trial and she is sentenced to ??????  I won't say much more because it will ruin the movie for others.  It is a good movie, good acting, and a good production, but it just wasn't my type of movie.  It is a coming of age movie which I usually love but this was too much drama for me.  I like the sweet and innocent coming of age stories.  I am a sucker for romance but I just felt like she was using this teenage boy who really had fallen in love with her.  For the men who say that coming of age stories are chick flicks, this is not one of them.  So my advice for all the men is to go see this movie and Kate Winslet will take her clothes off just for you.

0385333846|5.0|Kurt Vonnegut hardly needs my praise. It could be sufficient for me to say that \\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is a wild ride through absurdity, and full of wit, anger, and vision.  But I'd like to look at three aspects of the book that, from my perspective, make it an experience that will resonate with readers, and help to explain why the book should be read by anyone who wants to understand America after World War II and through to today.     First, there's Vonnegut's imagination. I read fiction fairly regularly, but it's usually earth-bound fiction; that is, books that hew pretty closely to what could actually happen, and which tell a story in approximately chronological order. Vonnegut is coming from another place. His books depart from many novelistic conventions and veer into absurdity of time, place, events, character, etc.  It makes for invigorating reading and opens up undreamed-of possibilities (and, not incidentally, it helped to show writers how far they could go and still attract a mass audience).    In Slaughterhouse Five, Vonnegut chronicles the life and the thoughts of a man (Billy Pilgrim) who himself is unhinged from time. Pilgrim remembers events, but he also foresees events. He travels through time, and he also travels through space. In fact, Billy becomes a featured creature at a zoo in another galaxy. It's tough to tell which things happened, and which didn't -- and that's one of the ways Vonnegut keeps you on the edge.    The second point I want to make is that Vonnegut is angry. This is one of the angriest books I've ever read. It's a brutal anti-war diatribe, and it also skewers middle-class life in America, religion, and much more. Billy Pilgrim has no business being in WWII, and he is supposed to be a non-combatant, a chaplain's assistant. But he becomes a POW, and he's treated with contempt by his fellow Americans, as well as his German captors. Through his plight as a POW, he sees horrors, such as shootings, hangings, and the bombing of Dresden (never commits violence -- his worst offense is bumping into people). When he's back after the war, he just stumbles towards middle class success as an optometrist and upstanding citizen, while growing increasingly disengaged from his life. Vonnegut is angry about the emptiness of all of it -- of alleged valor, of material success, etc.    The third and final point I'd like to address is free will. It's been said that the book is about free will, and I'd agree. But I'm not sure where Vonnegut comes down on the issue: Do we have it or not?  Billy Pilgrim just stumbles through life and lets things happen to him. Perhaps has free will and chooses not to use it, or perhaps his life is predestined. Meanwhile, others act on him, using their free will (apparently), yet forces act on them that are unavoidable.      In this way, Vonnegut is telling us something about the absurdity and pointlessness of life. For example, he writes about an American corporal who survived the battles and was actually a pretty good commander, but who, in a moment of weakness, stole a teapot in Dresden. He was executed by his compatriots just two days after the Americans bombed Dresden and incinerated 130,000 innocent inhabitants.  Was it free will that led the corporal to steal the teapot? Did he have to be shot for his crime (a crime, by the way, that many others also committed)? Did Dresden have to be bombed in the first place?   These are the kinds of things that the reader of Slaughterhouse Five will have to wrestle with long after reading this compelling book.
B001UREJWM|4.0|I must confess up front like many of the other reviewers that i'm a Sabbath freak in most forms so i'm hardly unbiased for this review. Huge fan of the four Sabbath albums with Dio and i loved the 3 new songs on The Dio Years Cd. Saw them on the tour and they were incredible so i had high expectations for this disc. upon first listen only a few tracks stood out and i was a bit disappointed. the disc seems to have one tempo throughout-plodding and mean sounding but a bit boring at times. i have listened to the album five times through since and it's definitely growing on me.  Standout Tracks-Bible Black,Double The Pain,The Turn Of The Screw,Follow The Tears,Breaking Into Heaven  Decent Tracks-Aton and Evil,Fear(didn't like this at first but it's growing on me),Eating The Cannibals  Lame Tracks-Rock and Roll Angel,Neverwhere    overall i gave this 4 stars and think it's a good album. all the boys still sound in fine form. they unfortunately set the standard high and i think this is the weakest of their output with Dio-even Dehumanizer had Computer God and this album doesn;t have anything of that caliber.
B000G0O5N2|3.0|This is a good film, but the video is not a pleasure to watch in blu-ray. Grain, bad contrast, bad colors. If this is what the director wanted, like some people say, so we could stay with the DVD. Talking about DVDs I saw The Hurt Locker in DVD ... an excellent new war film, about bombs disarmers. Great video quality in DVD ! In Blu-ray if they make a good transcription the video will be GREAT !!!
B000MR9D5E|4.0|The cinematography is truly spectacular. However, the whole collection, and each DVD within the collection, seems like a series of disjointed stories. The new movie \\"Earth,\\" which uses much of the same video, does a much better job of creating a compelling story that captivates the audience. The BBC series \\"Planet Earth\\" feels too much like a documentary. It would be a great reference collection for school-age kids, but it won't captivate them like \\"Earth\\" will.

B001SF8G1Q|4.0|I have always had a soft spot for New Morning, since hearing \\"Went to See the Gypsy\\" on a college radio station one night shortly after the record was first released. Dylan is in fine voice on this album; his unique and eloquent style of piano playing dominates many of the songs, giving it a unique vibe; and it may be his \\"happiest\\" record, celebrating the joys of domesticity, family life, and country living. \\"Gypsy,\\" \\"Day of the Locusts,\\" \\"Sign on a Window,\\" \\"Time Passes Slowly,\\" \\"If Dogs Run Free\\" are all examples of Dylan contentedly working on miniatures in the light. Fans of The Big Lebowski will have a Dude-dream flashback when \\"The Man in Me\\" rolls along. At the time of its release this album was hailed as a return to form by a counterculture intelligentsia worried by the inscrutable mess that was Self-Portrait, following hard upon the MOR countrypolitan smoothness of Nashville Skyline. \\"New Morning\\" marks the beginning of the peak period of his mature singing voice; he sounds gritty, with a manlier edge to his voice, and for better or worse the \\"velvet sneer\\" of the mid-60s masterpieces is gone forever. For all the variety of his material in the 70s, he went from strength to strength vocally; after \\"New Morning,\\" there came \\"Planet Waves,\\" \\"Blood on the Tracks,\\" the overrated \\"Desire,\\" the underrated \\"Street Legal,\\" and \\"Slow Train Coming\\" all of which feature some of Dylan's most powerful singing. \\"New Morning\\" was never his best-produced album, being rather ramshackle sonically with sometimes slapdash arrangements, but this superb remaster lets you hear it all more clearly and in greater detail. Highly recommended.
0618918248|3.0|Were it not for the fact that this book was written by noted biologist and science writer Richard Dawkins, it would be hard to recommend it to anyone.  Rather than providing a thoughtful contribution to the debate between religion and science, it is more of a diatribe, a rant, a package of vitriol, mockery, and abuse.  Am I exaggerating the problem?  Dawkins celebrates the virtues of science and its \\"liberating benefactions...to the human spirit.\\"  But here are some of the words he uses to describe religion: evil, mendacious, hateful, ignorant, weird, foolish, fatuous, absurd, odious, sanctimonious, hypocritical, superstitious, brainwashed, fascist (!), amazingly blind, lazy, defeatist, divisive, infantile, fanatical.  This is too bad, since Dawkins is a powerful intellect and a fine writer. It is thus remarkable that this book suggests what one might expect from a undergraduate writing a paper on how stupid religion is.  Dawkins considers only the worst, most extreme, most bizarre aspects of religion, which he takes as being representative of religion as a whole.  When he discusses religious authorities, predictably it is Jerry Falwell, Pat Robertson, or some addle-brained Creationist.  In the rare occasions he mentions a genuinely important religious thinker like Aquinas or Augustine, it is inevitably through a secondary source, indicating Dawkins has not bothered to read these figures. Indeed, he openly admits that he has not read much theology or tried to learn much about religion beyond what is available in the tabloids (it would simply be a waste of time, and he already knows what he would find, it appears).  As a predictable result, this is an anecdotal, impressionistic, and deeply biased account of religion.  Ironically, the very virtues of science -- open-mindedness, intellectual rigor, systematic use of evidence -- that Dawkins touts as setting science above religion are the very virtues he wholly ignores in this book. Imagine how Dawkins would respond if a creationist wrote a book telling us science was nonsense, and declared that he didn't need to know anything about science in order to write a book about it!<br />  Perhaps the best illustration of the double standard he applies to religion versus science is in his discussion of evil.  Dawkins seems to believe that religion is responsible for all or most of the evil in the world.  Of course, critics have forced him to confront the uncomfortable facts, that in the 20th century, the worst atrocities were committed by ideological atheists (Hitler, Stalin, Pol Pot, Mao).  He attempts weakly to argue that at least Hitler was really Christian (a dubious claim). But then he falls back on s a truly hairsplitting distinction: these evils, he argues, were committed by atheists, but not \\"in the name of atheism,\\" so you can't really blame atheism.  The problem is that the evils were committed in the name of atheist ideologies, so to claim they were not in the name of atheism is to rely on the very sort of dialectical subtlety for which Dawkins mocks theologians.  Most remarkably, he ends up insisting \\"we are not in the business of counting evil heads and compiling two rival roll calls of iniquity.\\"  But it would seem that is just what he has been doing, until confronted by contrary evidence!  Dawkins' strategy is to judge religion only by the evils committed in its name, ignoring entirely the enormous good done by religion.  Equally, he ignores the evils done in the name of science and materialism (eugenics, Social Darwinism, scientific racism).  The double standard could not be more apparent.  This books presents a caricature of religion, not a careful assessment.  It is guilty of the Straw Man (Straw God?) fallacy on a large scale.  Goodness knows, there is plenty to criticize about religion.  But Dawkins gives us 400 pages of mockery, abuse, and ridicule, rather than a genuine thoughtful debate on these questions.  If you want a serious discussion of the issues, you will have to look elsewhere.to look elsewhere.
B000JLSM00|3.0|The image quality of \\"The Searchers\\" is nothing short of startling. We'll get to that after I've lit into the film. Yes, I'm going to tear to pieces what is generaly considered one of /the/ great American films, and (by many people) the best Western ever made.<br /><br />John Ford was a great director, but I've never cared much for his Westerns. Maybe I'm tired of seeing Ward Bond play the same role again and again. Or perhaps it's just that I don't care for John Wayne, who is hardly my model of ideal manliness. (Jimmy Stewart was ten times the man John Wayne was.)<br /><br />\\"The Searchers\\" has two major problems, neither of which -- as far as I know -- has ever been pointed out. (After writing this, I browsed the Amazon reviews and found that other people have almost-identical reservations.) They render it a far poorer film than it could or should have been.<br /><br />The first is that it tries to tell two stories that have little to do with each other, and fail to mesh in any meaningful way. The primary story is Ethan and Martin's five-year search for Ethan's kidnapped niece. This is intercut with the broadly comic narrative of Laurie's frustration at trying to get Martin to come back and marry her. (Note Ken Curtis, later Festus on \\"Gunsmoke\\", as her dorky, guitar-strumming suitor.)<br /><br />It doesn't work. The search is morbidly dark, while Laurie's plight is silly beyond belief. Any possibility of dramatic unity -- this is, after all, a serious film about a serious subject -- is destroyed. (Aristotle would have heartily agreed.)<br /><br />Which brings us to the other problem. John Wayne was no actor. He was more than a decade from reaching the point where he could turn in a credible/creditable performance (Rooster Cogburn in \\"True Grit\\", for which he won an undeserved Oscar). In \\"The Searchers\\" he is still John Wayne, with a limited performance range that doesn't extend beyond what John Wayne, the man, is capable of.<br /><br />True, Wayne had a difficult job for any actor -- he had convey his hatred of Indians and desire to kill Debbie for 99% of the film -- then abruptly change his mind. The problem is that we see no motivation for the change. He picks her up, she looks frightened (she knows what he intends), and then, out of nowhere, \\"Let's go home, Debbie.\\" *<br /><br />It just isn't believable. Ford should have shown us John Wayne's face, so that we could have gotten /some/ idea of what was going through his mind. Why he doesn't is anyone's guess. Did he think Wayne was incapable of believably revealing his change of heart? Or did it never cross Ford's mind? Regardless, the film lands with a dramatic \\"thud\\" -- Something Important happens, but we don't have the least idea /why/. The moment the story is building up to /never occurs/.<br /><br />\\"The Searchers\\" would have worked far better if it had stuck with the search, and ignored just about everything else. Yes, it would have been an even darker film, but it would have packed a far stronger punch.<br /><br />I should not fail to mention, if only in passing, Max Steiner's miserable score. \\"Max Steiner\\" and \\"miserable score\\" are more or less redundant. The few good moments are swallowed up in a lot of unnecessary and trivial music.<br /><br />So why do people hold \\"The Searchers\\" in such high esteem? The reason appears to be that it was one of the first \\"deconstuctionist\\" Westerns. ** Ethan Edwards is bluntly racist, and is determined to find his niece so he can kill her. She's been polluted by her five-year contact with the \\"Comanch\\", and his no longer a \\"white\\" woman. *** She'd be better off dead, and Ethan is the man to do it. But however awful the Indians' behavior is, we are not on Ethan's side. Our broad sympathies lie with the Indians, not the Americans. ****<br /><br />Unfortunately, \\"The Searchers\\" doesn't achieve what it sets out to do. It's all hat and no cattle. You don't get points for trying to be profound -- you actually have to achieve it. In this, \\"The Searchers\\" fails quite badly. It's easy to imagine a remake that's far superior to the original.<br /><br />As for the transfer... Oh... my... God... I couldn't believe it. It appears to have been derived from the VistaVision camera negatives. I have never seen a more exquisitely sharp and detailed video image (and with zero apparent edge enhancement). Ford's use of multiple image planes, some in-focus, the others out -- is clearly displayed. *****<br /><br />Please note that in the supplemental material, someone describes \\"The Searchers\\" as having been filmed in three-strip Technicolor, which it almost certainly wasn't. And Martin Scorsese avers that VistaVision has greater depth of field than conventional 35mm movies. Wrong -- it has less. (It's hard to understand how someone who's been making films for four decades doesn't understand Photography 101.)<br /><br />If you're a fan of \\"The Searchers\\", do yourself a favor and get the Blu-ray. Even if you don't care for the film, buy it anyhow. It's a great demo disk. This was a film /made/ for VistaVision (\\"Motion Picture High Fidelity\\") -- the scenery alone is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />* One critic suggested that it's touching Debbie that causes his transformation. He can't bring himself to kill the flesh-and-blood being he knew as a child.<br /><br />** It also appears to be one of the first to make a stab at proper cowboy attire. Note the dusters on several characters.<br /><br />*** Another minor problem... Kidnapped whites almost always preferred living with the Indians. Debbie's willingness to return is not implausible, but it is unlikely. In the very last moments, she does show some apparent fear at being among whites again.<br /><br />**** According to the supplemental material, \\"The Searchers\\" was the first Western to show a lot of dead Indians lying around after having been massacred by whites.<br /><br />***** This is common in Ford's films.to the original.

0060833459|5.0|I have taught this book in a dozen university courses. It remains a classic for understanding effectiveness in organizations and specifically \\"how to manage oneself\\".    Even after 40 years, the book remains relevant. Most of my students, predominantly in their 20s, feel that the book is relevant for today. The examples are a bit dated and the use of the male pronoun throughout is awkward. Nonetheless those minor flaws are far outweighed with systematic writing and practical insight.    For Drucker, effectiveness is habit, a set of practices that can (and must) be learned. It is neither a skill, nor is it knowledge. Instead it is a set of simple practices which simply must be engaged in regularly. Drucker frees us from the idea that effective people are born, have a talent or temperament for effectiveness.    Effectiveness is \\"getting the right things done\\". This is very different from efficiency, which is merely \\"doing things right\\". Effectiveness is the key to the growth of the entrepreneurial economy.    The five habits of effectiveness are: 1) knowing where your time goes, 2) focus on outward contribution, 3) build on strengths, 4) concentrate on a few areas that produce outstanding results, and 5) make effective decisions.    Drucker walks through these habits in a highly engaging writing style. He explains and illustrates the habits and provides practical information based on his experience with dozens of executives over decades.    While many of Drucker's books are excellent, this is possibly the one that is most widely applicable for anyone who seeks to become more effective and to manage themselves for effectiveness.

B001SN78JO|3.0|Carl Allen (Carrey), a divorced, borderline reclusive couch potato says, \\"No\\" to everything.  His negativity naturally steered him towards the divorce, his general malaise, and his work as a loan manager.  When his friend Nick (John Michael Higgins) convinces him to attend a cult-like `Yes' seminar from Terrence Bundley (Terence Stamp), his life soon changes.<br /><br />Following the yes-mantra in every way, Carl soon meets Allison (Zooey Deschanel), who allows spontaneity and bizarre creativity to rule her life.  She is think outside the box personified, and, more importantly, different than the pre-vow Carl in every way.  Together they attack life and cross off a checklist that looks stolen from an insane person's bucket list.  Along the way, Carl predictably learns that in order to truly enjoy life, and another person, one must be open to new experiences and take life as it comes.  This is right up my philosophical alley, challenging oneself, breaking through barriers, and being able to look back in your later years with admiration.  The result is silly, typical Jim Carrey, with just enough laughs to make it enjoyable.  I especially enjoyed the name of the alternative band led by Allison: Munchausen by Proxy.  That's hilarious.  However, there are two major problems with this movie.<br /><br />First, and not as significant, the cross-generational implied sex scene between Carl and his geriatric neighbor is enough to make a billygoat puke.  It's unnecessarily gross, and I've been less appalled by the Saw series.  Secondly, however, is the naïve nature with which Carl embraces the \\"say yes to everything\\"-culture.  After giving a bum a ride and allowing him to run down his cell battery, Carl drops the guy off in a dark, remote park and gives him a wad of cash.  Murders start out this way.  Imagine if he had said yes to other situations that could have been presented:<br /><br />-Seriously, do you want to go in that meth house?<br />-Don't worry about protection; let's go au natural.  OK?<br />-Can I tell you what it is after you eat it?<br />-I know that hitchhiker has a bloody shirt and an ear-necklace, but I feel good about him because his sign says he's a vet.  Want to pick him up?<br /><br />There's promise to the premise, but just like everything in life, there are shades of gray.<br /><br />Overall, Carrey is pretty funny, especially during the Nebraska football scene, but I feel like the co-stars stole the show.  Zooey Deschanel is cute, and off-beat enough to make the character believable.  Other than Maggie Gyllenhall, I can't think of another actress who could have believably pulled it off.  Stamp is convincing as the self-help guru Bundley - his brood is like a snake-swinging church.  Higgins is hilarious as a cross between an insane man and a liberated free-thinker.  The true scene-stealer, however, is Rhys Darby as Norman; his costume parties (Harry Potter and 300) are hilarious, and his awkward Britishness (?) fits perfectly into the niche necessary for plot development.<br /><br />Even though my single word feeling about this movie is, \\"Meh,\\" I happily say \\"Yes\\" and recommend it if for no other reason than to see Jim Carrey return to his comedic roots abandoned after Me, Myself, and Irene.n I tell you what it is after you eat it?  -I know that hitchhiker has a bloody shirt and an ear-necklace, but I feel good about him because his sign says he's a vet.

This was the second CD I ever purchased (Metallica - Garage Days, Re-revisited was the first).  The rest of my Kiss collection was either on cassette or vinyl, and I was looking forward to my first kiss CD!  But when I gave it a listen, I was disappointed by the lack of \\"edge\\" in the songs.  Kiss sounded like they were trying to be Bon Jovi or Poison, two bands that I didn't much care for at the time.  As a music trader, I ended up swapping this title for something else... However, I recently decided to complete my Kiss collection, and this was the only hole in the discography. If you are a completest, or enjoy late 80s radio friendly hard rock, this is worth the purchase price for a used copy.

B001PPGAIA|4.0|When I first bought the dvd and watched it I had mixed feelings about it. I thought it was good movie but not great. After watching it over and over the movie started growing on me. I began to like it more and more. And now I love it.    Watching Hugh Jackman and Nicole Kidman at their first meeting I am cracking my sides with laughter. I barely do that when I watch television comedies. Watching them grow to love each other and start to care about others it was wonderful to see their characters develop.     The movie is a romantic comedy, no it is a mystery, no it is an action adventure, no it is a drama. The movie even has a villan who I did despise. And the villan looses everything! And I did feel vindicated! Yes this movie has it all. I loved the little aboriginal boy. He is cute, smart and adorable.     It may not be the greatest movie ever made but was it supposed to be.   This movie had me at Welcome to Australia!

But I love the warm analog sound some vinyl has, and this was remastered with TLC,  so I went for it.<br /><br />  Played \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" 1st, my favorite slow Metallica song,  and the high end sounds very shrill and over-recorded. I can't believe it !!! I tried 3 different cartridges/styli. All with the same results, WTF<br /><br />  The rest of the songs sound fine , but Nothing Else Matters was a disaster, especially during the first half.<br /><br />  Favorites with best overall sound quality are \\"The Unforgiven,\\" \\"Wherever I May Roam,\\" \\"Enter Sandman,\\" {which sounds great of course, especially done up analog}. The vinyl here is powerful, especially on a high-end system with the right cartridge. I'm playing this back with a Stanton 680 HP cartridge. (If you can still find one, grab it)<br /><br />  Please leave a comment if you personally had audio problems with \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" --- something you noticed as well. Thanks.

The research, theories, and views on success is simply mind blowing! You come out feeling more and more confident about your own ability to under stand the world of victors, and be able to enhance your own chances to become a member of that elite club. Easy read, suggest to anyone with an open interested mind!

This story had everything I was looking for. Adventure, Supernatural and of course forbidden love. I will not get into telling you the whole story like so many other reviewers do but I will let you discover the joy of City of Bones for yourself. This book is a definitely worth your time and if you loved the twilight series, then I know you will love this trilogy.
B001K3JF7K|1.0|We expected more from Diana Krall given her history of bringing old jazz standards to life with fresh interpretations and clever improvisations.  One has to work hard to make these clasics of Jobim so dull.  We can only hope that this is a temporary lull in Diana's otherwise strong career.
1416550542|5.0|This is a marvelous book, the kind of rich, complex story filled with unforgettable characters that I adore -- the kind of book in which to lose yourself on a rainy day -- or any other day!  This is the perfect book club discussion book, too.  If no one in my book club picks it before it's my turn, it'll be my choice.  The only thing that would have made this book better for me is if Morton had spent more time on Nell's life after her foster father divulges her abandonment as a child.  I wanted to know more about those years between 18 and 60+ -- but I understand why Morton chose to leave those years out except in short summary.  I guessed the ending about midway through the book, although I certainly didn't guess everything.  I loved the way Morton was able to weave all the story threads together and the way she kept surprising me.  I can't wait to read her first novel now and plan to take it with me on vacation next month.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.
