0061689246|3.0|But my friends tell me the movie absolutely smashes the book in performance and storyline.  Haven't seen it -- only read the book.<br /><br />I expected something along the lines of [[ASIN:0060558121 American Gods: A Novel]] or his masterpiece \\"The Sandman\\".  Instead I got a foolish villager making a foolish promise and going over The Wall into the faerie kingdoms, in search of a fallen star.  It is romantic, and follows the form of fairy tales in that wits and not brawn determine situations.  Did not like the ending.  Thing is, I have read Gaiman doing so much better... and it made me wonder why 'Stardust' wasn't at that level.<br /><br />Maybe I'll catch the movie someday, but don't set your expectation too high if you read the book.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|By popular demand I've chosen to rewrite this review.  It's important to note right off the bat that if you've invested in High Quality cables or headphones then in order for them to work with this case the case either needs to be modified or you need an adapter, which will probably defeat the HQ.  If you don't care about that then skip to the next paragraph.  The hole in the case for the 3.5mm jack is only 5/16\\" in diameter, meaning your cable harness needs to be 4/16\\" or smaller.  See my User Uploaded Image for a visual of what I'm talking about.  In my large collection of high dollar cables and phones, none will fit.  This is why it can be a 1 star.  If I had not used my dremmel tool to bevel the hole wider then I would have chucked this case straight in the trash.  Even if you do have high dollar cables I recommend doing the mod if you can because I'd rather have my barely noticeable modification on this case than have to deal with other cases that I don't like as much.  With that WARNING out of the way, on to why I like it so much...  It's a nonbulky case with a very snug fit that added grip and ruggedness enough to protect in case of a fall (and it has taken and survived numerous falls, even face down).  The screen is amazing and you can't even tell it's on there.  I tested out my Bluetooth headphones and got the same signal strength and range, and the touch sensitivity for the screen was still the same. The only thing lacking on this case is a little zazz, and for those looking to show off I'd guess you might rate this case a 4 star.  But if you're like me and like practical things and don't want a bulky and/or expensive case in your pocket then this is where I say it's a 5 star.
B000FBFN1U|4.0|Like many others, I discovered this series from the HBO series Game of Thrones. The first book, Game of Thrones, was amazing. I tore through it in about a week as I couldn't put it down. Martin was a bit wordy, but the plot still moved forward. Clash of Kings was all over the place. It took me months to read it. Some chapters were 5 star and some were 1 star. Storm of Swords was better because the plot did move forward in the majority of the chapters.  The negatives are that adding new characters makes the individual POV chapters a lot more choppy to read. Although most of the chapters in SOS were more interesting to read than COK, it was more jarring to get into the storyline only for it to end aburptly and go to another one. Even though I expected this because the first 2 books were written this way, it does really disrupt the flow of the story. And it's getting more annoying because I am not vested in a lot of these newer and uninteresting characters.   The other biggest negative is the lack of editing. I hear some comment about Martin's wonderfully constructed prose. This series went from a lot of words that tell a great story to too many words with a story in there somewhere. In all honesty, there is no need for these books to be about 1000 words. The same story could be told even better around 400-500 words. There are endless pages of descriptions that could have been summed up in a sentence or two. A writer needs to know that when a reader finds herself skimming, the writer has written too much.  Despite the choppy and long read, I still very much enjoyed this book. Dany and Tyrion are my favorite characters so far. The story had a lot of twists and turns. Some unexpected and some very predictable.  After reading all the reviews and comments about FOC and DWD, I've decided to read them both at the same time. They are supposed to be happening at the same time after all, so maybe it won't seem so bad. I'm just glad that I didn't have to wait 11 years to find out what happened to Dany and Tyrion. Then again, who knows how long it will take for the Winds of Winter to come out?
B005LJK3AC|4.0|I'm not sure why there are so many one and two star reviews. I don't think my sense of humor is THAT much different from most people. I didn't think the movie was predictable or boring. The situations were funny, the bosses were over-the-top in a good way. There was action and shock value. All the actors were great.The only thing I can think of that would be a legitimate reason to not like Horrible Bosses is perhaps the less-than-plausible storyline/circumstances. The three guys had so many opportunities to be caught due to their inexperience or some would say stupidity. Who owns a huge house and does not have an alarm system? The likelihood of no one being home during every \\"surveillance mission\\" is slim. Announcing in public that they're looking for a hitman? \\"Luck\\" had a lot to do with the success of these guys. Regardless, I can completely overlook that and rate this movie highly because it does its job as a comedy.
B003UNYCJO|5.0|Arizona Dream has to be my favorite \\"odd little movie that could\\". The first time I watched it, I became more than just a fan of Johnny. I became a lover of his courage while choosing projects. He typically does not make his decisions based on the amount of money he could earn. He waits for a script to speak to him, and picks from the heart. Though one could never be 100% sure of everything this quirky movie is trying to say... It obviously has a great deal of heart, and an over abundance of deliciously strange!
B004EPZ07U|1.0|This is being falsely advertised in my opinion.  The Ultraviolet digital copy only lets you stream the movie using wifi to your devices and after signing up for two different services.  Worst thing is that you cannot use the movie with itunes and to watch it on an iPad or iPhone you need to be connected through wifi.  3G is just not enough to be able to watch it (in fact, it says you need to connect to a wifi source to watch) and, at least for me, makes the purported digital copy basically worthless.  You therefore can't watch, for example, in an airplane or while driving to keep the kids occupied.  If I am connected at home I'll use the dvd or blue ray.  Basically paid way to much for something I'll never use.

B00192KCQ0|1.0|Look, it's been what, three years since the Met-boys released their latest album of all-original material (Lulu is a collaboration and not strictly speaking a Metallica project, per se). I am a HUGE fan of the old stuff -\\"Puppets\\" was my FIRST real metal album (I was 13 & got it in '87) -then subsequently went out and got \\"Kill...\\", \\"Ride...\\" and \\"Justice\\" plus a few of the EPs floating around at the time -all on vinyl. I didn't really care for the infamous \\"Black\\" album or any of their 90's crap including \\"St. Anger\\" -it mostly sucked.<br /><br />When I heard they were FINALLY getting around to recording something new, i.e. original material, I admit I was stoked and a bit skeptical. We all know the 90's sucked for thrash, and when death metal stagnated around 94/95 -real metal was in trouble and the Met-boys showed us the road they were travelling by paving the way for commercially acceptable \\"metal\\". Well I decided not to purchase \\"Death Magnetic\\" for awhile but finally found a used copy in Zia Records here in Vegas in '09.<br /><br />First off: the absolutely over-compressed/overly loud production. I have the 2011 re-issue of Death's \\"Human\\" -obviously being a complete re-mix AND re-master the volume has also increased. I listened to a tune off \\"Human\\" and then one off \\"Death Magnetic\\" -same volume and the Metallica song was hella loud! Realizing this is a newer recording I tried comparisons to other new recordings -same result. The Met-boys win in this arena -the clipping is so bad I never listen to the album. I actually got rid of the CD it was so bad. I don't play Guitar Hero, so I don't know how those versions sound but as far as the album release -terrible, utterly terrible.<br /><br />The songs themselves aren't terrible. They are a throwback to \\"Justice\\" and the \\"Black\\" album era -with a different bassist. I actually like a few tunes -the issue is none of them are memorable. Even the \\"Black\\" album has a ton of memorable songs, like'em or not -and any metal fan worth his/her salt knows the intro to \\"Puppets\\" and the classics of the band. Songs on the album aren't bad, they just don't stick -like someone sprayed'em with Pam cooking oil. They actually sound uninspired and contrived -i.e. forced. It's like Metallica recorded this because they had to or something because they failed to release any real metal for almost 20 years to that point.<br /><br />Metallica is a band who does only one thing right: they tour constantly -which keeps them in the public eye (ear) and they play all the \\"hits\\" -people go to party and hear loud music. The Met-boys only real talent is touring (anymore) and they have capitalized and cashed in on this. How many tours did they do in the 90's? How many during and after \\"St. Anger\\" -the \\"Getting out of the studio because we have no ideas & we're bored\\" Tour...?! They are a business, pure and simple. They haven't been in it to make music, metal or faux metal, for a long time. Their strength and security is in touring and keeping the name alive.<br /><br />To prove my point: they have released two albums with original, Metallica inspired compositions between 2000 and now -they record an album with Lou Reed -a collaboration project and they continue to tour non-stop (The Big Four Tour, anyone) to keep up their credibility. Look at the \\"free\\" downloads of their live shows available on their site and you'll see almost the same songs over and over (every band has live staples, I get that) but they have no variety anymore. They are a tired band that keeps rehashing the same tired \\"metal\\" music over and over and over. Hell, I would even get sick of \\"Puppets\\" if I had to play it all the time.<br /><br />Metallica are done, from what I can see at this point. Unless they get a new drummer and inject some fresh ideas to create real metal, they're just a \\"metal\\" version of the Grateful Dead, a band that just keeps touring. Musically speaking, this album is a decent step but the horrible production makes itunlistenable; whatever good songs are present were irreparably ruined by the over compressed mix and production. At least \\"Justice\\" had memorable songs -sterile, dry production notwithstanding. Glad I didn't waste my money and buy this new...unlistenable; whatever good songs are present were irreparably ruined by the over compressed mix and production.

B0044XV3QY|1.0|I saw this in the theaters in 3D -ooh, aah. I rented it when it came out on DVD (you know, those things that hypocrite director, one James Cameron, says are destroying the planet?). My sister got this version and I borrowed it. Why? Don't know... Stupid I guess. Just like anyone who buys into the premise of this movie.<br /><br />Look, the visuals and effects are stunning, no doubt -Cameron may be a hypocrite but an innovator he is. The movie shows us that the American military (I assume there is still an America in the movie's timeline) are basically a bunch of mercenary thugs. Then it shows how we humans are horrible and destroy everything and want to kill everything around us. Wow -haven't seen this before. In my opinion I found it to be a cross between \\"Dances with Wolves\\" and \\"The Matrix\\" -without any redeeming qualities. The political allusions were more than prevalent -Cameron makes his point clear without being overt.<br /><br />The premise is humans suck and need to be beaten up to learn our lesson. So my review premise is this: James Cameron's last really good film was \\"Aliens\\" (Titanic & T-2 were decent) but this movie is a tired retread of past ideas mashed into a horrible stew of crap. It sucked -a visually stunning, effects laden pile of crap with a tree-hugging, Gaia-is-mad-at-you plot. Lovely... save your money and buy the far superior \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\" -though not as exciting, it will stimulate your mind in a far more creative way and has a better story.

B005CK76ZA|5.0|No need to review Nirvana's Nevermind, it is the greatest album of the nineties. This is a review of the 4 LP 20th anniversary edition of Nevermind. Beautiful sounding 180 gram vinyl packaged in a sort of double gatefold sleeve. Content wise, my only complaint is that instead of so many demo versions of the songs, they should have included the Butch Vig mixed version of the album. Other than that, it's really nice, and will only become more valuable over time. 4 1/2 Stars.

B000FOQ0TG|5.0|Mindcrime was one of my favorite albums during my college days and because I only had the cassette version it fell out of rotation over the years. What astounds me listening to it again is how relevant this album still is. Possibly more so now than it was during it's original release. Queensryche pulled together a collection of songs wrapped in a theme that was both topical and prescient.<br /><br />\\"Fighting fire with empty words. While the banks get fat, the rich get rich and the cops get paid to look away as the one percent rule America\\"<br /><br />The strengths and weaknesses of this album are largely unchanged and time hasn't diminished the quality of Mindcrime very much at all. The concept, the story, the arrangement and scope and some really fine songs with punchy choruses and Tate giving it all and the band creating a great soundscape are the strengths. The weaknesses are still the production (even remastered) on occasion; Tracks like Needle sound pretty thin on record and are much better live. The lyrics are occasionally too obvious as well but they detract little from the package.<br /><br />One thing to note about this package is that it is not the Livecrime release. The DVD here is a collection of the video segments you may have seen for the singles and the live album is a later recording and in my opinion not as strong as Livecrime. If you really want the full Mindcrime experience then you need to purchase the Operation Livecrime DVD separately. Mindcrime is a really visual album even in audio form so when you can actually see the album come together on stage before an audience with animation and video sequences, combined with the performances, it really brings Mindcrime to life.
B004SBQAN8|3.0|This is the entertainment business, and you know, they try, but probably the most entertaining thing about this movie was how it came to be. There are a lot of great films based on books, and even more great books deserving film adaptations, but rather than take a literary success and bring it to the big screen, Dreamworks decided to buy the rights to, of all things, I Am Number Four. Oh yeah, and they purchased them a year before it was even published! All because James Frey, author of A Million Little Pieces, decided to start a fiction franchise that pumps out books and movies that could be marketed to teens.<br /><br />But hey, why not? It was bound to be a success. A young man escapes a planet just as it's being destroyed, ending up in a quaint town in Kansas Ohio where he attempts to live a normal life, only to find that he possesses superpowers, which really throw a kink in his small-town romance. That exact story has already worked out once -- why not a second time? All you need to do is get the creators of Smallville to write the script, toss in some beautiful people and a few Michael Bay explosions, and you've got yourself a hit.<br /><br />I Am Number Four opens on a scene of said beautiful people partying at the beach. Our hero, John Smith (Alex Pettyfer), is having a blast with all his buddies, and even gets invited to a sexy swim with the school hottie, where she delivers such lovely dialogue as \\"The big dipper. It's my favorite.\\" I doubt she could even name another constellation, but that's neither here nor there, because suddenly a scar on John's leg emits a blinding light, signaling that Number Three is dead. For some reason that may or may not be explained in the book but certainly isn't in the movie, the survivors of planet Lorien can only be killed in order, so it's time for Number Four to go on the run. He and his protector, Henri (Timothy Olyphant, whose last name always reminds me of Lord of the Rings), burn all their belongings and hit the road, but an eeeeevil gecko sneaks onto their truck.<br /><br />Their flight leads them to Paradise, Ohio, where the gecko turns into a cute puppy...of DEATH! At least, that's what I kept expecting. But when the puppy passed up numerous opportunities to transform into a horrible monster and slay everyone, I ended up just being pretty confused about why they built up so much suspense.<br />Puppies aren't the only danger in Paradise, however. There's also Sarah (Dianna Agron), the school sweetheart. There's an alliterative joke in there somewhere. Something like \\"dogs are dangerous, but nothing can match the peril of the...\\" I don't know, some word for cat.<br /><br />Anyway, Sarah is an irresistible clich&eacute;, the blonde who dated the quarterback of the football team until she picked up photography, thus gaining a lens into the soul and learning the true meaning of love. At least the quarterback is original, except for the fact that he beats up science nerds and can't understand why Sarah doesn't want him and hates John for moving in on his territory. And the science nerd isn't just a science nerd. He happens to have a dad who was totally abducted by aliens so he's obsessed with rooting out all extraterrestrials at the school. All this is nothing at all like Smallville, because in that show, the blonde photographer is the same person who wants to root out the mystery behind the alien occurrences, and a different character is the love interest.<br /><br />I feel bad bashing this formula so much, because I have to admit, the characters really were hot, which is what really matters. Dianna Agron of Glee fame is a girl next door of no compare, and Alex Pettyfer is, undeniably, a beautiful piece of man. I mean, in his next movie, he literally plays a guy whose main character trait is that he's really really ridiculously good looking. Based on that alone, I figured I'd be able to enjoy their romance, but man, was I wrong. This was supposed to be a superhero movie, darn it, and we end up sitting through more than an hour of plodding romance with no action whatsoever. And it's not good romance either. It's just like Twilight: all meaningful looks, lip biting, and a thirst for blood.<br /><br />Maybe not the last one so much, but when this movie wasn't Smallville, it really was Twilight. The main guy has a secret that makes him an outsider at the school, but a beautiful girl is intrigued by his mystery and they fall for each other. And Loriens, unlike humans, only fall in love once and it lasts. Isn't it romantic? Blehck. Males everywhere will squirm in their seats. On the other hand, it's a perfect date movie. The guys will be excited to go, the girls will acquiesce, and then the girls will be so pleasantly surprised by the fact that the guy took them to a chick flick that they're sure to sleep with them. Except studies show that scary movies are much more likely to get you laid, so oh well.<br /><br />Although the whole first hour had me teetering on the edge of boredom, what's scary is how much I actually ended up liking the movie, because, you see, the last 20 minutes kick so much ass! The action sequence is the only place you feel like Michael Bay was attached to this, and it shows. Number Six (Teresa Palmer) arrives, and she's this hot, sarcastic Aussie girl with wavy blonde hair who can kill the evil Mogadorians like nobody's business and deliver one-liners right after. She slides on her knees, hamstringing baddies while Number Four deflects plasma gun blasts with his hands, shooting them back at his foes. Six can turn invisible and teleport and generate a fire shield and all this sick stuff. Which brings up the question, why is John's main superpower the ability to turn his hands into flashlights? I mean, like, I guess that would be sort of useful, but I'd way rather be able to turn invisible. The movie has to find all these excuses to have the battles take place in dark places so that John's power is useful, and it's amusing to see how often they work it in.<br /><br />Number Six was so cool that she saved the movie.The fact that she arrived at the end meant that I left feeling super stoked, which colored my whole experience with such a positive light that I couldn't help but enjoy myself. I don't know why she wasn't in the movie the entire time. Having someone fun and sarcastic was exactly what the plot needed to keep it from taking itself, and the romance, way too seriously.<br /><br />So, way too much slow, clumsy romance (and don't get me wrong. I love Titanic and The Notebook), and not nearly enough action, but the premise is good enough (even if it's stolen straight from Superman), and when the fighting actually starts, it's awesome (explosions, fireballs, plasma guns, giant winged monsters). If they made a sequel, I would definitely see it. Therefore, I give I Am Number Four:<br /><br />3/5 Stars<br /><br />Why did John decide to reveal himself to so many people in Paradise? The film made it look like he'd had a ton of close friends at his old school, but the second they found out about him, he fled. Within days of moving to Ohio, he was willing to confide in all sorts of people. Seems pretty fickle for a Lorien who's supposed to bond forever, but maybe that same fickleness will mean that Number Six is a love interest later. Who wouldn't pick Number Six over Sarah?

0780629450|1.0|I recently watched this, along with the Laurence Olivier and Mel Gibson films.  I thought this was by far the worst.  Most of the actors sounded like they were reading Hamlet, rather than being the characters.  The worst by far was Jack Lemmon.  How in the world could a great comedic actor be allowed to embarrass himself with such a ridiculous performance.  Not only was he too old for the role, but he sounded like an old American reading Hamlet for the first time.  It was painful to watch.  Robin Williams looked like Robin Williams doing stand-up.       I also did not like the memory flashbacks.  The audience is capable of imagining what 'poor Yorick'  looked like as he bore Hamlet on his back.  We didn't need for the film makers to act out the memory.

0446547654|4.0|Having read all his books (excluding that Wokini book) I may be a little biased on my rating.  The style of writing is typical Nicholas Sparks.  This isn't a bad thing mind you.  He is such a great writer. However, the plot was not one of his greatest. It did not send me into a emotional frenzy like his previous book, \\"Safe Haven\\", did.  Nor did it bring me to tears like his \\"At First Sight\\" or \\"The Last Song\\".  I think it is because I am all to familiar with his books, but 1/4 way in I knew there couldn't be, my definition, of a happy ending.  The parts of the story I loved most involved reminiscing about the past high school lives. In those moments I just stop and think about my high school life and how love was so much simpler back then.  \\"The Best of Me\\" may not be the best of Nicholas Sparks' books; but, it is defiantly not a bad book.

It is a good read for a History Teacher; but, I found that there was too much \\"political detail\\" about the 1916 First World War and not enough story about the people involved.  Also, there was a hugh flu pendamic that killed about 50 million people that was not mentioned.  I think about 15 million, or more, died, in the USA, as a result of the soldiers \\"bringing the flu home\\" with them.  Funny, the flu epidemic was barely mentioned. What was pointed out was was that this war killed millions of men...for nothing other than to satisfy a few politically motivated people.  Same as usual...  the masses pay the penalty.. the arms dealers make billions. Definitely, not worth the $18.99 e-price for this book.  Sincerely, Linda Cormier
B0007VZ9DU|5.0|This is my favorite movie of all time. I love mob movies such as Casino, Good Fellas, all of the God Father movies and Scarface.
0385534639|5.0|Amazing, different, beautifully written and very creative. A delight on all levels to read, and you don't know what story you're actually reading until it all comes together in the end. I was entranced through the entire book and can't wait to read her next book!
B003IMMEKG|1.0|Why on earth would Amazon sell a Region/2 disk in the US. This disk will require a multi regional Blu Ray Player: not the average player sold in US retail stores.  Region B/2: Europe, Greenland, French territories, Middle East, Africa, Australia and New Zealand.  Do you see \\"North America\\" anywhere in this listing??? This disk would have to be listed as an ABC disk (or A, not B) to play in the US!  Regards,  Don_   Brian Booth Says:  The seller is \\"Region-free titles\\" and it is a 2010 release from \\"Optimum Home Releasing\\". If you search for Red Sonja on Blu-ray.com, you'll see the product made by Optimum is marked as region free. I'm thinking it's probably just a mistake in the description here on Amazon made because Optimum is based in the UK. I'll order one to make sure though.  EDIT: Okay, the disc cover actually says Region B, but it plays fine on my Region A player and I just finished the movie. If you watch the film and want to leave your rating at 1 star, I certainly wont blame you as the movie was pretty lame. But please don't rate it as one star because you 'think' it won't play on your player. As much as I dislike the film, what you are doing is pretty unfair.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|Look around you for something that has words on it (cereal box, phone book, etc).  Pick it up and start reading.  Whatever it is I guarantee it is better written than this garbage.  Oh it's all spoilers  I don't know if I can list all of the absurd coincindences in this book, but I'll try:  Jack Reacher HAPPENS to take a bus and HAPPENS to ask the driver to make an UNSCHEDULED stop at a small town.  He then HAPPENS to walk right by where two people are murdered, and he's accused of the crime.    One of them HAPPENS to be his brother who he hasn't seen or spoken to in years.  Not enough for you?  Oh don't worry there is so much more.  There HAPPENS to be a hot detective for him to get it on with.  There is a new Chief Detective in town.  He's there because the old guy \\"commits suicide\\" and some bad guys running the town want a worthless schlub to take the job.  Oops they ended up hiring a harvard educated Boston cop with 20 years experience.  Worse one of the bad guys KNOWS him, and for some reason doesn't tell the others \\"Hey this guy is a 20 year vet with a masters from Harvard.  Don't hire him.\\"  After deciding that Reacher didn't MURDER anyone, for some reason the local police let Reacher essentially take over their investigation.  He proceeds to MURDER people.  Then he tells the police, \\"Hey I MURDERED two guys.\\"  Do they take him back into custody?  No.  Ask for any state or federal help with multiple murders including police and federal agents?  NO.  Reacher then MURDERS 5 other guys and then MURDERS 3 other guys and burns millions of dollars.  Surely there will be some kind of repercussion?  Somebody will at least say, \\"Hey you need to stick around town while we sort out all the MURDERING, corruption, and counterfeiting.\\"  No he just gets on a bus and drives away.  I am apparently a glutton for punishment because after finishing this book I tried the second in the series thinking maybe it would get better, but no.  The coincidences abound there as well.  Reacher HAPPENS to be going into a dry cleaners as a woman who HAPPENS to be an FBI agent/daughter of the Chief of Staff/god daughter to the President is walking out and oops!  She's being kidnapped!  And for some reason the guys who are doing it (and who start the book by MURDERING someone) take Reacher along and don't MURDER him.  I won't ruin the rest of it for you, but hopefully you get the idea.
B000BDLJBU|5.0|This is a very high quality plug for projects such as rewiring a headphone plug.  I used a \\"helping hands\\" type fixture to hold the plug and the wire and it made soldering a snap.

B0050PYNP8|5.0|This movie did not do very well at the box office - maybe it is like Sean of the Dead (same actors) - I think both movies were very funny and well done.  I really liked Paul - very clever movie that is just fun to watch.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This program is easy to use. It seems much better than the other free versions and even supports Google docs.
0439023521|5.0|As I watched the hype grow about this series, I have to be honest that I was quite skeptical of this story. Once I read the first chapter I was hooked and completed the first book in a day. During the reaping, much like \\"The Lottery\\" two people are pretty much sentenced to death. I read each page feeling real fear for Peeta and Katniss. Also, not wanting to spoil anything for anyone, but I am Team Peeta. Although, Katniss and Gale have had this thick friendship for quite some time, it couldn't replace the fight Peeta and Katniss have went through together. I would absolutely recommend this book series to my friends and even strangers.

B0026S1XDM|5.0|Who needs a review for such a classic.  It's just so impressive how many musical moods he managed to fit into one piece of music...just like Jethro Tull's Thick as a brick, the whole thing was too long to fit on a single side of an LP so it had to be cleverly split in two parts.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|Here's what you will find on the new Coldplay album:   1. A duet with Rihanna (dictated by a recent federal law which requires all artists to feature her on at least one song)   2. We're-not-worthy album credits praising the involvement of Brian Eno (also required by federal law)   3. All-male \\"oh-oh-oh-oh-oh\\" chorus chants apparently designed to attract inebriated females at Italian discos   4. Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall -- which suddenly will sound so much better than when you first heard it and felt disappointed by it   5. Shortage of classic songs in the vein of Yellow, Fix You, Clocks, or Viva La Vida   6. A pretty good imitation of one (Paradise)   7. Bad mastering on all the louder songs & slightly less bad mastering on the quieter songs   8. Transmissions from outer space masquerading as songs (Don't Let It Break Your Heart)   9. An affecting little gem (Up In Flames)   10. A song so epic, Chris Martin forgot to write a chorus for it (Charlie Brown)   and finally  11. Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall --again.  Seriously, it sounds so much better that you remembered...)
B005FJ7DOM|5.0|This was an excellent movie, if this film had a bigger budget it could have been a blockbuster. There were exciting moments, sad moments, and happy moments, but overall this movie could have been better. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes horror. I hope they make a sequel.
1594744769|3.0|This book has kind of a eerie vibe at the beginning due to the photographs. It is told from the perspective of 16-year-old Jacob who grew up hearing his grandfather Abe tell tales about the people in the photos. I enjoyed about the first half of the book. When Jacob goes to an island to find out more about his grandfather's upbringing, the story ceased being kind of goth and creepy, and instead became more of an adventure story. I read through the rest just to get to the end. I was hoping for more of a weird Wisconsin Death Trip vibe after looking at the first few photos when Abe is describing the people. The photos are from real collections, and the author has done an interesting job telling a story that weaves in the photos. I didn't find his writing style particularly literary, but it was descriptive and kept the story moving along. I just wish the second half of the book was as good as the first half.  Also, I read a hardcover copy; I think this book would not have been as enjoyable read on a Kindle.  I really liked looking at the photos and going back to see how he had characterized the people in them.
0385534639|5.0|I hated for this book to come to an end. When I first started reading it, I thought it a bit too strange after reading the first 35 pages and put it aside to return to the library. After some thought,I picked up the book again and couldn't put it down! I normally don't read fantasy books although I did enjoy the Harry Potter series. Ths descriptions are so wonderful,I could imagine it all. I wish there really was a circus such as the Night Circus. It would make a great movie or even an animated version would be better. I'm interested and anxious to see what this new author will write next.
0446547654|3.0|Nicholas Sparks can write a good story and he has a wonderful way of expressing the emotions of his characters. The downside of this book is that it follows the same formula as many of his earlier works. When the reader gets to page 256, the ending becomes obvious, leaving him/her to a foregone conclusion.

B004RPKUTU|4.0|Coraline...It's a children's book that's not totally a children's book...It's a horror novel that's not totally horror. Above all, Coraline is a great, entertaining, well constructed novel.<br /><br />I really enjoyed Coraline. Coraline is a well developed character, especially for a children's book. She is independent, yet craves love and affection. She has a vivid imagination, but is bored by her normal surroundings...until she goes through the secret door that is.<br /><br />Coraline encounters many different characters on her adventure, and none of them are bland. Her neighbors are interesting, and the versions of them on the other side of the door are even more so. Her \\"Other Mother\\" is a well-formed monster of a villain, even without a whole lot of description. (I could do a whole discussion here on Freud and the Unheimliche and how scary that can be, but I'll spare you all).<br /><br />Bottom Line: Coraline is a must read for more than just children or fans of horror novels.<br /><br />Trev @ [...]
0689877692|5.0|My 6 year old grandson and I love pop up books. This is our newest. We marveled at each page as we looked for the red dot. We are still not sure about where it is on page one!
B000JMKTLO|3.0|This is an okay book, no more, no less - but it is definitely not a mystery - once al the characters are introduced, it is pretty much clear whodunit...<br />However, it is well written in a good prose - that's why I gave it three stars.<br /><br />But it has a lot of problems (probably because it's a debut, and Flynn's second book - Dark Places - is incredibly good) and I'll try to summarize some of the bigger ones IMO.<br /><br />**ALERT - There will be some SPOILERS from now on...<br /><br />I like disturbed and twisted characters, but not the weak ones... And that is Camille's problem - she's weak.<br /><br />Having a self-centered mean mother is something that I, unfortunately, am very aware of... But letting this woman still have this kind of effect on you after all this time, and not responding to her awfully cruel statements is beyond weak for me...<br /><br />So, since I didn't really like the main character, it was hard to care that much about her ordeals... Plus, how dumb and blind one has to be in order not to see what her mother was doing? Or the little crazy sister?<br /><br />Besides, it sounded odd to me that her editor, which she claimed to care so much about her almost like a father, would send her to the most horrible nightmarish town in the world. (Seriously, if a place like that really existed, they would all be dead by now - having killed each other from their boredom and cruelty.)<br /><br />Another problem for me was the so similar personality of the two dead girls; I mean... it is possible, but very unlikely to happen that two girls so alike were living in the same place at the same time and would be chosen randomly to be killed. Nonetheless, it takes ages for someone to realize it could not be a coincidence...<br /><br />And finally, the end was too long. The so-called twist was predictable; it was not necessary to beat around the bush for pages and pages before ending the book...<br /><br />If I had read this book first I would never have read Dark Places, which would be a real shame... I strongly recommend that book, but Sharp Objects here... not that much.harp Objects here... not that much.

B0053YGYO4|1.0|After listening once and then twice and then once more(with a feeling!) the conclusion is: I am done with this band. Sure, the debut is great and the second release shows so much promise, but after that it's all going downhill. I love Coldplay and I have all their albums but this is just overkill. Nothing to shout about the songs<br />either. They are like the left-overs from Viva which is not saying much anyway. Old songs polished as new. Totally forgettable.<br /><br />One of its many reasons why this album fails in every aspects is because of its intolerable loudness. Worst crime of all is the over producing and the bad mastering works. It's all LOUD throughout the entire album, with no distinctive quality to separate the sounds of the instruments and vocals to make it \\"warm\\". Everybody wants to do the loudness war nowadays, it seems.<br /><br />Those who listens through their ipods won't notice this but from my audio player it is all flat out loud. What a waste.

0553381695|5.0|After watching the Game of Thrones series on HBO I was immediately hooked on the storyline and the characters!  I wanted more.  I never really have extra time to sit and read but I made time for the next book and it was SO worth it!  I do get a bit confused with all the different Ser's and Lord's after a while, but Mr. Martin is very helpful with his maps and charts at the end of the book to help with the confusion.  I couldn't put the book down and am starting book 3 today.  I enjoy that after watching the HBO series I can put names with the actor's playing these characters.  It makes the story even more exciting.  I hope that the tv series keeps taking off like it has and we will be able to watch all five books come to life.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|this is excellent!  I am strapped for cash and needed a nice office app.  Thank you Amazon for making this free, and thank you OfficeSuite for making such an awesome office app.  Works flawlessly on my Xoom and Atrix 2.
B004HW7JMO|5.0|It took me a while to get into 'Spartacus: Blood and sand', while I enjoyed it the first time I watched it, it was only after discussing it with friends of mine that I found it more appealing and started overlooking what I had originally perceived as flaws in it. Flaws is one way to say it, while the extreme violence and gratuitous nudity do not scare me, they do not seem relevant to the story and only make it difficult to watch at home having a 4 year old who enjoys watching TV with his parents...<br /><br />Well, Gods of the Arena follows the same formula of its predecessor, and why shouldn't it if it proved to be a success?<br /><br />Originally conceived as a flashback episode for season 2, the creators decided to expand the flashback and make into a 6 episode miniseries after Andy Whitfield, who played the role of Spartacus, had to leave for treatment on his Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. By creating a prequel to the first season, they would allow Andy to complete his treatment and return on time for the second season. Sadly, Andy passed away back on September 2011.<br /><br />If you enjoyed Blood and Sand, Gods of the Arena will be a treat. In this prequel we basically get to learn how all characters from season 1 ended up in the situation they are at the beginning of the series.  The house of Batiatus is led by Titus, Quintus' father and Quintus is still friends with Solonius, here we get to see how they became rivals. The series is basically about the rise of Gannicus, the champion of their ludus and all the evnts that led to the season 1 when Spartacus arrives. I do not intend to spoil anything else because if you liked the first season, this one is a must. On top of all that, add  special appearances by Jaime Murray and Temuera Morrison.<br /><br />The video quality is great for a DVD presentation, it is presented in anamorphic widescreen 1.78:1 and looks great when upscaled in my BD player. Audio on the other hand, while not lossless as in a BD, is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 which delivers a more than acceptable audio presentation. If you are playing this in an HD home theater, this is nothing that a little twitching on your HT can't improve.<br /><br />The bonus materials include production design documentaries, convention panel and bloopers. I am still not fond of the presentation of the discs on the digibook-type cardboard cases, it feels cheap and discs may get damaged if not kept properly. With season 1, the discs came stained with glue from the cardboard because of the way they were packed, fortunately this did not happen with Gods of the Arena, but I believe they can do a better job packaging these.<br /><br />If you have not seen either of these ('Blood and sand' of 'Gods of the Arena') I would suggest to start with 'Blood and sand. While 'Gods of the Arena' is a prequel and should stand on its own, I found it more enjoyable once you know the characters from 'Blood and sand'... just a thought<br /><br />Now let's wait and see how they do with 'Spartacus: Vengeance\\"han acceptable audio presentation.

0765367297|4.0|I am a hopeless gamer.  I enjoy sci-fi and fantasy stories, movies, and television.  From the inception of the Halo series by Bungie, I was hooked.  Halo: The Fall of Reach recounts what the final chapter of the Microsoft/Bungie software collaboration started.  A great read to fill in why we see so many SPARTAN-class soldiers.  This book was a nice complement to the game that followed it.
1594744769|4.0|This book was definitely unique.  It was unlike anything I've read before, or will likely ever read again.  I definitely loved the uniqueness factor.  I also loved that it was a male narrator.<br />I really liked Jacob and liked his personality quite a lot.  In the first half of the book (or close to it) I felt like he really popped and was a character I would put on my favorites list.  However my love of him faded just a bit but I can't really put my finger on what, exactly, it was I didn't care for.  Nothing specific I guess, he just kind of faded and didn't POP out at me in his personality like he did at first. It's not a big deal though because the storyline and other characters really did make up for it.<br />This book is filled with old photographs and they correspond with the story.  I loved that he could describe a photograph, or even just a person in the story, and then it was displayed on the next page.  Having the visual was awesome and added another element to the story.  Made it more real, I suppose.<br />The story itself was pretty awesome.  It was a fast read, and rather difficult to put down as I was anxious to see where things would go.  Were his grandfathers stories true?  Did these Peculiar children really exist?  And if so would Jacob find them or find out more about them?  What really did kill his grandfather?  Well, I'm not going to tell you, you'll have to read the book, but I have to say that you may be surprised with some of the twists and turns and the different elements that come into the whole story.<br />The book left off like it's the first in a series.  Not with a cliffhanger, but with plenty of threads left open. And I just looked, and yes!  There will be a sequel!  I will definitely be eagerly awaiting it.

0062101897|5.0|How does one describe a book so thorough, so all encompassing, on such a wondrous journey like Harry Potter? It's very hard to put into words how wonderful this book is. Weighing in at around 7 pounds, with over 2000 photos in it and many more words, I cannot begin to describe how much enjoyment I have getting from this book. It is a magical read that takes me back to when I first watched each movie. Characters, locations, magical objects, story lines, wardrobe, fun facts, EVERYTHING IS IN THIS ENCYCLOPEDIA of all things related to the Harry Potter movies. Buy the book, well worth the $40.00 I paid. The only person who could possibly top this masterpiece is J.K. herself.
1416594884|5.0|John LeCarre appeared to be at the end of his comfort zone with the end of the Cold War. Nobody told spy stories set in this era better than he. Who can forget \\"The Spy Who Came in From the Cold\\" or any of the others?  Suspense, drama, thrills in every book.  And following this drawing of the Iron Curtain, LeCarre seemed to founder a bit, but not so with \\"A Most Wanted Man.\\"  He has new spies with their new loyalties and even manages to bring back some of the old ones.<br /><br />Of course, LeCarre cannot get away from the Russians, and in this story, we find a young Russian name Issa who's been smuggled into Germany--with a lot of money and he's a Muslim, or so we're led to believe.  So you get the segue--from Cold War Russkies to modern day Terrorists with Middle East ties. Still, LeCarre manages to handle this quite well--with his usual suspense, intellect, and creativity.<br /><br />\\"A Most Wanted Man\\" is indeed a \\"rebound\\" for LeCarre and his devout fans won't be terribly disappointed here. It's a good read!

You want to try to describe thunder over your cell phone to a dog? We have to bring it too. Get the big system cranked up, and plant your ass. This album is all about the texture, and the power. It's not about deep lyrics. When Waits wants to, there is no equal, either in feeling or melodic content. This is what he's like after a bottle of hot sauce and real Monte Rio coffee. So, turn it up, and also, don't let me see you chatting away in distraction to your cell mate. Get a firm grip on something. Face it like winter. Stick your face into it and grin. What a great time this album is. They should issue a special wet suit and cape to wear with it. (addendum added...today it's Nov 9, 2011, and Bad As Me (the album) just made it to position #1 in Billboard's charts of sales. Waits has never made it in the top ten before.

B0054XOMX4|5.0|Alright first things first.. i'm usually rather critical on giving what some would call a \\"gushing\\" review but for once... I REALLY LOVE THIS BEY.  after three launches... 6-7 minute solo spin time... now for a science lesson for anyone wanting this bey so they can use the B:D (Bearing Drive) tip to extend spin time of others. It will help them.. but its not the biggest reason this bey spins so long. Its called centrifugal force. See with most beys theres a lot of weight still in the center of that metal ring. This one has a plastic disk in the center... that means the majority of the weight is along the outside of it. this makes it spin a lot easier and harder to make it stop. Dont believe me try yerself. Take two heavy objects, like backpacks of books. Hold them close to your chest and back and spin circles (typical bey with weight more central) now extend your arms and spin.. waaay easier to go fast but harder to stop  Review in summary: Currently my absolute favorite bey. May change when next batch of beys come in but yeah.. sofar so AWESOME

B0053B347M|4.0|The price was good for what it is, however the sticky tape that holds the lighting kit is poor quality. I remedied that problem with 3M double sided tape on both edges and center of the line to prevent it from moving. It does as is advertised, which is to provide a white light in the background to reduce eye strain and look cool doing it. Although not innovative, definitely something a gamer or anyone who uses the computer in a unlit room at night. Good buy overall, just wish that the tape was stronger and lasted much longer than it actually did.
B00005B4GU|5.0|Although Amnesiac may not be the \\"best\\" or most \\"influential\\" album in a catalog void of serious flaws (barring, maybe, Pablo Honey), it is certainly their most artistic statement. To me, Kid A is an overrated, patchy record with a couple amazing songs; Amnesiac, however, has fewer stand out tracks but flows and feels more unified. And the songs that do stand out here --\\"Pyramid Song,\\" \\"Knives Out,\\" \\"Life In A Glass House\\"--demonstrate a maturity and confidence that, at least in my opinion, can't be heard on Kid A at all. Another, more personal, reason I love Amnesiac is that frankly it appeals more to my jazz sensibilities as a listener. I find listening to Amnesiac to be a more enriching experience than Kid A, and I feel that there is a cohesiveness to Amnesiac that is not present on its vastly more famous (and slightly more influential) counterpart.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|I've used many apps to deal with MS files on my phone.  Most worked well enough, but this one is well thought out,  and easy to use.  My biggest problem with my other app that I purchased was the 4 tiers of menus I had top go through to get any kind of formatting.  This app is smooth, fast, nicely integrated with google docs, and above all easy to use on a small screen.  What you would need often is easy to get to, and everything else is close by.    It's as full featured as you can expect a phone MS Office editor to be.  I got for free on the free app day, but will purchase in milliseconds as soon as my wife gets her phone.  This app developer deserves the support.  As a side note the other app &quot;office&quot; I purchased nags you to register until you give in, despite being a paying customer.  This developer provided an option to register, remind again, and to ignore.  ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL.    HIGHLY RECOMMEND.
B002TVQ4HG|5.0|Solid movie.  Not a blood and guts horror movie. If you want to see an overplayed blood fest go watch something else.   The movie has you follow the plot line in deja vu.  It keeps you guessing and reaching for the next reality.    Melissa George is terrific in this movie.  She plays the role to perfection.

0060254920|5.0|This book has always been one of my favorites.  My son is three and this is probably his favorite book, and we have many books.  I have also read it to students; it is a favorite among many children. Wearing his wolf suit, Max enters a magical world known for it's \\"wild things\\" after he is sent to bed without his supper.  This book is technically a picture book, so the speech is simplistic and the pictures are many and very detailed-typical of Sendak. Little children can relate to the imaginative personality that characterizes Max, as well as his mischievous behavior.  In the end, Max gives up his kingship when he is lured back home by the \\"smell of good things to eat\\" (his supper) and his desire to \\"be somewhere where someone loves him best of all.\\"

B004LROUNG|4.0|With \\"the Litigators\\", Mr. Grisham once again takes you into the world of a struggling strip mall law firm, and describes in detail, the life of most lawyers, who struggle to make ends meet, each and everyday.  Detailed and entertaining, as always, Grisham has created another page turner that leaves the reader asking for more.
B00000AF98|5.0|I truly love this album.  I found KISS in the early 90's and this is one of my faves along with Revenge.  You need to pick up this album and listen to QAll of Paul's songs (minus Bang Bang You). I love this cd,
B004OZOTSQ|5.0|Works great! This app is very useful and makes putting files or anything on or off your phone very easy without worrying about needing to connect cables.

B005XOPEOU|5.0|As with most Coldplay albums, the more I listen to this one the more I love it.  It definitely has a different sound than some of their previous work, but the Coldplay we all fell in love with rings through in all of the tracks.  As cliche as it sounds, their music can really make you feel \\"alive\\", and this album is no different in that respect.  Quick note - listen with a good set of headphones or a great stereo to get the full effect, as there are many hidden instrumental and vocal gems.  There's not much to add after some of the stellar detailed reviews by others, but here are a few of my personal thoughts on some of the songs:  1. Hurts Like Heaven is fun and fast-paced.  The beat reminds me of something from The Cure, and it really makes you tap your toes.  This along with Don't Let it Break Your Heart are the fastest songs on the album and they're both great.  2. Charlie Brown is amazing - one of my favorites (although I enjoyed the live version just a tad more).  As others pointed out, listen for the subtle Peanuts \\"Christmastime is Here\\" at the end.    3. Us Against the World - absolutely beautiful \\"classic Coldplay\\" track  4. Princess of China (aka \\"The Rihanna Song\\") had me concerned prior to listening to the album.  I think it turned out pretty good and is growing on me, as I find it somewhat haunting and Rihanna's voice mixes well with Chris's.  I look forward to singing along with it in the car.  This song will probably be the most debated.  5. Up in Flames - I've heard some complaints about the mixing on this album.  This is one of the few times I agree that the beat really detracts from the beauty of the song.  The cheesy beat overshadows Chris's falsetto and unfortunately sounds like it came off my 1980's New Kids on the Block album. Take that out and the song is perfect.  6. Up With the Birds starts out kind of randomly, but around 1:40 it changes course and becomes what I would call Coldplay perfection.  I wish this part lasted longer.  When listening to this song I get a mental picture of a storybook closing as it would on a movie- as it is the end of this story told on the album.  Overall I love the album.  I think it's great that they're trying out new sounds yet remain familiar in so many ways.  That said, I really hope they don't experiment much further than they have here, and am hoping for a more acoustic album the next time around (as I had heard this album was originally going to be).
0876852630|5.0|Charles Bukowski, like Henry Miller, can be credited with doing away with the picturesque myth of the starving artist.  Factotum, though it may be a physically thin book, is heavy, soaked and dripping with lyrical depictions of gritty realism and coldly honest truth, which may be something about how being unemployed and poor really, really sucks.  Factotum, Bukowski's second novel, reads less like a novel than of a series of mostly short episodes that make up the life of Henry Chinaski, Bukowski's protagonist and alter-ego.  Nevertheless, this is what it's pretty much about: Chinaski, circa 1944, has been rejected from the World War II draft and, unable to make something of his life by fighting, spends his time drinking, wandering whichever town he's in, having sex with a barfly here or there, doing a little writing, looking for work, getting jobs and (subsequently) losing jobs.  He isn't interested in actually working at all and wants to be able to support himself by writing.  This is all pretty autobiographical, as Bukowski went through the same stuff.  Chinaski's inability or unwillingness to get through the day without a drink or twelve, plus his ambition to keep writing for a living as his priority, plus (again) his total antagonism toward physical labor, keeps him perpetually unemployed for much of the story.  Every now and then he gets a job and makes enough money to get by.  What seems to get the story rolling a little more is his meeting different women here and there, particularly Jan, a girl with some of the same problems as himself (and for whom he seems to show genuine affection), and Laura, a gold-digger who introduces Chinaski to her rich sort-of boyfriend.  Much (if not most) of Bukowski's writing is autobiographical and as I read this book I wondered if all of these characters were based on real people, if the conversations really took place, if everything Chinaski does in the novel is/was based on something Bukowski did in real life; if they were true, I'd wonder about those people, not out of shock, but out of something almost like concern or care.  I don't know.  Bukowski really makes these characters come alive, despite some of the dialogue being a little sparse in places.  You still seem to get a feel for them, even when they're particularly horrible to one another.  That brings up something else: part of the whole rejection-of-the-starving-artist-myth-as-picturesque-thing means having to get pretty down and dirty.  Factotum, like a lot of Bukowski's stuff, is grim as hell.  Most of the encounters are things I'd never wish on anyone.  The book can get seriously depressing and I don't recommend this book if you've been saddened by anything in your recent lifetime or are taking medication or drinking a lot.  Then again, Bukowski really succeeds in making you care about the characters once you've been around them long enough.  You get the feeling that, even when Chinaski and Jan argue over this or that, they end up spending enough time together that they really do actually genuinely seriously care deeply about each other.  And they KNOW it and they WANT it.  They're like an old married couple, sort of, in they way they've gotten to know each other so well over time that they almost wouldn't know what to do if one of them left forever.  It's sad in a way.  Actually, it's sad in several ways.  That said, it's definitely worth your time to read Factotum.  Some say Post Office is Bukowski's best novel, but I don't know, I think I like this one a little more.  It's unforgiving and yet it's somehow redemptive, to get so real and honest and into places you've never been before, and then suddenly you come out on the other side and see that you've somehow made it.  This book does that to you.
B001UV4XFG|4.0|Bought this in used condition but it came like new. The only problem was that it didn't come with the sleeve like my other Twilight movies so my collection is a little off. But the discs are in great condition- almost like new.
B005DKLPQ0|5.0|Hearing this music again brought back a lot of memories. While I continued to play my original vinyl from time to time throughout the years, I was mainly focused on \\"Meat is Murder\\" and \\"The Queen is Dead\\" and somewhat dismissive of the earlier material. These remasters bring a depth to the earlier material that was missing on the original editions which sounded flat. Hearing the band on these remasters is a revelation (especially the early material) and a must purchase for anyone interested in The Smiths. Plus, you can't beat the price for the quantity of music. My only complaint is the repetition with \\"Louder Than Bombs\\" and \\"The World Won't Listen\\". While it is cool to have mini LP cover sleeves of those releases, the music is mostly redundant and could have been combined. Either way, at this price it's not really an issue. Buy this edition even if you own the older editions, it sounds WAY better!
B004BJMEO6|3.0|The movie was great as far as content and the actress Necar Zadegan was amazing but the movie was continuosly interrupted by narration which I found very annoying.  Every romantic scene had background music, therefore you can not here any sounds of kissing, breathing, etc., that you would expect to be in a sex scene.

Our job is to figure out what they're [customers] going to want to want before they do.\\"--Steve Jobs...towards the end of this book shortly before his death.<br /><br />I've read a lot of books and done a lot of reviews (I am a top 1000 reviewer) and I can honestly say Steve Jobs is the most unique person I have ever read about. He truly thinked and lived differently.<br /><br />Steve has picked the right person to write his biography. Walter Isaacson is a gifted writer.<br /><br />Everyone in this book, including the Apple Inc, is a persona. The author writes about Steve Job's life in the context of his relationships with his companies (Apple,NeXT,Pixar), girlfriends, wife, children, parents (adopted and biological), siblings, employees, partners, mentors, friends, and rivals (Bill Gates in particular).<br /><br />If you want to know about Steve Jobs and his relationships in detail, you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />I wish Steve had written a business book of his own that contained all his best wisdom. This book would need to suffice.<br /><br />Here are my most intriguing takeaways:<br /><br />1)Steve Jobs was famously prickish but I had no idea just how much of a prick he was. He would insult, yell, swear, belittle, initimdate, frighten people around him on a regular basis. Self-control he did not excel. Tempermental and impatient he definitely was. But the amazing affect was that his boarish behavior often motivated people to do great work. He believed that if he had accepted B+ work, then all he would get would be B+ work at best. Instead, he ALWAYS demanded A+ work and he would not relent until he got it.<br /><br />2)Steve believed in making insanely great products first and foremost. Companies that were focused on improving  bottom line were doomed to mediocrity. In order to make great consumer electronics, he believed in tight integration and control of software and hardware. This is something he fundamentally disagreed with Bill Gates.<br /><br />3)Steve learned early to believe in the power of his mind and intuition. He lived in the magical zone where rational thinking coincided with imagination and technology crossed the liberal arts. Steve's deep intuition allowed him insights that very few ever hoped to achieve. He could read and dissect people's strengths and vulnerabilities and exploit them.  He could look at a design and intuitively understand how it worked and what it lacked.<br /><br />4)Steve's perfectionnism in the design (look and feel) and attention to detail were phoenominal. He would argue over where the period in his \\"Steve P. Jobs\\" should be precisely located, for example. He would insist on having no 90 degree angles on any of his machines, and not even on his software. Nothing was above his scrutiny, even whether the \\"GS\\" in the iPhone 3GS should be in italic.<br /><br />5)Like every great man, Steve made great many mistakes and learned from them (except for his proclivity for boarishness). Steve wasn't always successful. Indeed, most of his resounding sucesses came later in life after many failures.<br /><br />6)Steve often believed in doing the opposite. To be rich, one needs to castaway materialism. To motivate, one needs to critical. To build an an amazingly complex devices that work, one needs to focus on simplicity. To build a great company, one needs to take focus away from the bottom line.<br /><br />I loved this book and ended up loving Steve Jobs and all his flaws. RIP Steve. The world will miss you and thank you for your wonderful contributions to our world.d early to believe in the power of his mind and intuition.

B0051UP5NQ|4.0|I was surprised that an app this caliber became a free app of the day.<br /><br />It completely changed what I can do with my devices.  It works so much easier than googledocs and isn't a memory and battery hog like the other doc editors out there.<br /><br />This app also has the same permissions as other document editors.  It has all those permissions in order to tell when you get a call, text message, etc so it can manage system usage and not kill your battery life when you are on a call for long periods of time.  These permissions are standard with most apps that have memory intessive processes.  All those people who complain about permissions need to read up on developing for the aos does and needs.<br /><br />My complaints are that it lacks, true, universal support.  Without openoffice support this will never be a five star app.<br /><br />It also has issues with importing cell formulas.  If you make a spreadsheet with the app then you should be OK.<br /><br />Just a warning, Amazon does not have the same system for device compatibility.  Some older or newer devices will see this, download it, and it won't run or have bugs because of your devices hardware.<br /><br />Would really love to see this on my Logitech Revue, when it gets Honeycomb and/or ICS.  Works on DX, Bionic and Incredible.

B004QK5N5W|3.0|This product works as advertised but is unfortunately App aware of managing what is output through the HDMI port.  For example, HBO Go and NFL Mobile (Red Zone Channel) are aware that the HMDI port is active and tranmist a splash screen of their respective logos rather than mirror the desired video image.    For HBO Go, this is a bit surprising considering I could just as easily (and do) output my Laptop image via HDMI to the TV.  I was hoping this would save me the extra hoop of my laptop quirks such as battery life to watch a simple on demand show.  It doesn't.
B000OCXFCO|4.0|When this album first came out four years ago, I couldn't shut up about it.  My opinion was that it was the best Megadeth album since Countdown to Extinction, and the heaviest since Rust in Peace (slightly edging out Countdown in \\"heaviness\\" but falling short of RIP).  United Abominations has since been trumped by 2009's Endgame in both heaviness and song quality, but I still find it to be a very good disc in 2011.    After the release of 2004's The System Has Failed kickstarted the modern Megadeth era via mostly studio session musicians, Mustaine put together a new touring lineup, featuring brothers Shawn (drums) and Glen (guitar) Drover.  Chris Poland (who played guitar in the studio on System in 2004) wasn't interested in touring or being a full-fledged band member, 90s-era Megadeth guitarist Marty Friedman had lost interest in playing metal, 90s-era drummer Nick Menza was prevented from rejoining Megadeth by health issues, and longtime founding member Dave Ellefson (bass) wasn't yet back on speaking terms with Mustaine after a falling out in the early 2000s.  Thus, Mustaine had no choice but to recruit new help.  The Drover brothers were just what the doctor ordered: they were hungry, packed quite the musical punch, and provided Dave with the needed support for returning Megadeth to its' thrash metal roots.  Glen Drover has since been replaced by Chris Broderick, and the revolving door of post-Ellefson bassists has been replaced by...well,...Dave Ellefson himself, but the United Abominations lineup was excellent, and sound very tight on disc.  Mustaine scrapped his more radio-friendly songwriting of the mid/late 90s and returned to his thrash style from the 80s.  While these songs aren't quite as heavy or inspired as classic pre-Countdown material, they are still quite good.    Don't expect \\"Rust in Peace: Part 2\\" as some overeager fans have labelled this release, but if you miss the days when Megadeth was an actual METAL band, United Abominations will likely bea refreshing listen for you if you haven't checked out any of the band's modern material.  Yes, there are some cheesy lyrics here and there, and it has since been bested by it's 2009 follow-up, but musically, this album is a strong continuation of what Dave was trying to do on The System Has Failed.  Highlights for me are Washington is Next!, Burnt Ice, and Sleepwalker.  Even Dave's sped-up remake of his own mid-90s-era song A Tout le Monde is well done (as a duet with a female vocalist, nonetheless!!).  When this album was brand new, I was so fired up by it that I would probably have given it a five-star rating, and even after four years of being a staple in my CD collection, I'll still give it a solid four stars.  Recommended for fans of both 80s thrash metal Megadeth and 90s hard rock Megadeth.
B001UHOWW4|4.0|Excellent work on both DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 and 1080p video. There are rightly-deserved credits at the end for the restoration team.
B002C6K7N0|5.0|After 1990's landmark album Rust in Peace, Megadeth's sound, more or less, began to get less and less heavy with each subsequent album during that decade.  1992's Countdown to Extinction, while still possessing a somewhat thrashy sound at times, was Megadeth's version of Metallica's 1991 Black Album--a very good dose of heavy music, but a clear departure from their previous 80's style thrash metal.  1994's Youthanasia and 1997's Cryptic Writings were safe, solid hard-rock records, but definitely alienated fans of their earlier work.  1999's appropriately titled album Risk, was the nadir of Megadeth's downward trend away from a heavy sound toward radio-friendly pop-oriented rock.  By this point, most longtime fans (including myself) felt that the band had devolved too far from their early signature sound, and pretty much gave up on the hope of ever hearing an album like Peace Sells, Rust in Peace, or even Countdown to Extinction ever again.  After a failed attempt at returning to a heavier sound with 2001's The World Needs a Hero, Mustaine disbanded Megadeth, apparently calling it a career.  Three years later, seemingly from out of nowhere, Mustaine recruited Peace Sells-era #2 guitarist Chris Poland to help him record a new album.  Originally intended to be a solo project, The System Has Failed was released in 2004 as a new Megadeth album due to record label pressure.  Unable to reconcile differences with the other 1990s-era band members (including founding member and longtime bassist Dave Ellefson), Mustaine put together a new 2000's Megadeth lineup, including current drummer Shawn Drover, and went on tour.  \\"New Megadeth\\" had arrived. The System Has Failed, while suffering from questionable production, was a decent attempt at a return to form, and, in my opinion was on par with Cryptic Writings.  The follow up, United Abominations (2007), was noticeably heavier than The System Has Failed, and it appeared that Mustaine was truly attempting to make Megadeth relevantin the metal world again.  On a heaviness scale, United Abominations was slightly more thrashy than Countdwon to Exctinction (though not quite as GOOD as Coundown, but a very solid album nonetheless).  After a few typical tweaks to the band roster (namely the addition of Chris Broderick on guitar), and a heavy touring schedule, the band headed back to the studio the following year.  The resulting record is Endgame, which is (in my opinion) the best and heaviest Megadeth album in almost two decades.    While Rust in Peace is pretty much untouchable, Endgame comes pretty damn close.  I remember thinking to myself \\"Megadeth is really back now!\\" when United Abominations came out, but that 2007 disc now pales in comparison to this one.  From the opening instrumental track's virtuoso speed metal guitar storm, into the get-your-adrenaline-pumping energy of This Day We Fight, you know you're in for a treat, the likes of which haven't been heard in the studio from Dave Mustaine in a long, long time.  Several mid-album tracks wander back down into United Abominations/Coutdown to Extinction/Cryptic Writings level of heaviness, but the high points on this album absolutely blow the doors off.  All four band members, especially Mustaine and Broderick on guitar, are completely on fire throughout the whole album.  The album's flow is great.  The best part for me is, after two years of repeated listening, it hasn't gotten old yet.  This one seems like it will have staying power.  If you liked Megadeth in the 80s and early 90s (Killing is my Business through Rust in Peace), but didn't care for their softer stuff, give this album a spin.  I doubt you'll be disappointed.  Metal album of the year for 2009, and five stars from this listener.

B0011U8NZ2|5.0|The Doors as a rock band endured the test of time, and their live shows have a lot to do with this.  Jim Morrison was as unpredictable as art itself in the 1960's, and many harrowing performances derived from the culture of those times.  This particular CD, captured live onstage in Pittsburgh, shows how remarkable the Doors were after four years together.  The 1970 tour would deteriorate completely by the end of the year, yet the early 1970 shows are a must for fans.  Musically, this was their highlight tour.  Now, thanks to Bruce Botnick, we can all be a part of that history.  Well worth getting, even as a casual fan.

At this stage we now know who the bad guys - and girls - are. Also it's never revealed why an incriminating picture was so desired by this group making the ending and the story-line even more anti-climatic and raising plausibility issues. An additional warning - there are some gory parts that go beyond sensationalism (gore-porn)!?

B005HPA2XI|4.0|You really need to listen to this record many times to understand it. The first time I listened to it, I was thinking: \\"Every song sounds the same, every song has the same tempo, and the solos are boring\\". However, after 20+ listens you can really pick out the small details in each song. You also realize that you aren't listening to Mastodon for the solos; you are listening for the bits in between. The hooks are few, far between, and short, which really makes you look forward to them. I do feel like a lot of the songs could/should have been longer and were underdeveloped, which is why I don't give 5 stars. Every song is hovering right around the 3 minute mark, which frustrated me considerably. All in all it's a good record though.

0062011847|2.0|I've been re-reading a lot of Pratchett recently ([[ASIN:0060502932 Going Postal]], [[ASIN:0061161659 Making Money (Discworld Novels)]], [[ASIN:0060013168 Monstrous Regiment]],[[ASIN:0060815310 Thud!]], [[ASIN:0061020648 Guards! Guards!]]) and thought it'd be lovely to get the new book, [[ASIN:0062011847 Snuff: A Novel of Discworld (Discworld Novels)]].  My significant other ended up reading it before I did and let me know it was weird before I started reading.  Maybe this is why I was so particularly sensitive to the style and story, but I think his initial assessment was correct.<br /><br />Every few chapters I was able to note something else that just didn't seem like Sir Terry's writing.  Much of the beginning of the book feels as if someone else has taken Discworld and jotted down a fanfic... as if making a Vimes stew in which there's a little of Sybil, a little of Willikins, and of course Vetinari to begin with, along with some token cameo appearances... except, they're just sort of the outward things we know about them, instead of the personalities that were shown to us before.  One thing that seemed odd was Vimes' swearing.  When before swear words were used for emphasis, it seemed like they were thrown around rather violently and with less thought of whether they were really needed.  I swear like a sailor, so it's not shocking to me except that the characters were acting so uncharacteristically.<br /><br />The story near the middle/end \\"feels\\" more like Pratchett stylistically, but the story seems disjointed.  We readers are sent back and forth a few times without that much reason.  I've never had so many moral issues with Sam Vimes' behavior, either.  For me, he acted like a terrible bully for most of the book.  A moral, righteous bully... but still a bully.  In other books, it felt more like he used force in a more passive way, whereas here it just seemed like he was overtly forcing his way into every situation.

B004LROUW2|5.0|This book cannot be put down. It draws you in and mesmerizes you in it's powerful twin moonbeams. Powerfully written and translated, I enjoyed it far more than all the dragon tattoo books combined!
B005LLXB9K|5.0|I saw this a few weeks ago in a theater and was amazing.  At first, I wasn't sure where it was going.  But it quickly picked up and loved the fact that there was extensive footage of Andrew Wood; having never actually heard him speak, made it alone worth the look.  It's wall to wall great music and in depth current interviews with everyone surrounding the band.  I'm a Pearl Jam junkie; saw them at MTV Unplugged and followed them around in the early years.  I can't believe it's been 20 years; the material made me reflect on life moments as I followed the band.  Awesome job by Cameron Crow in direction and interviewing.
B005G4TJI4|4.0|This is an enjoyable science fiction actioner, with a fairly plausible plot for this type movie.  It also has excellent acting, both the live actors and the voice acting for the Transformer robots.  Only beef is that it's language makes it inappropriate for tweens and pre-teens.  Overall, excellent for adults and recommended.
B002I0J5FG|5.0|In short: I'm glad I finally picked these 2 up.  Despite hearing about these games for years, I'd never tried them. I didn't have a PS2 during their heyday (I was an XBox kid), and heard about them much later, spoken of by others with reverence. I'd always meant to pick them up, (I now have a backward-compatible PS3), never got around to it, but now that this HD version is out, I guess it's ok that I waited.  ICO:  A brilliant platforming game. Having played the God of War games before ICO, it's plainly obvious to me now where many of those games' platforming elements came from. The animations are very fluid and realistic. Meaning characters sometimes jerk suddenly or stumble as real people would when trying to make certain movements. As opposed to most games where characters just sort of float. It's very cool, kind of reminds me of the original Prince of Persia. The thing that's really striking about this game though is how little is actually explained to you. There is NO HUD whatsoever, at any time. There's no tutorial to explain buttons. I didn't know I could perform one action until halfway through the game, when I needed to do it. And having to bring your companion along is immensely rewarding. You really get attached to her.  Shadow of the Colossus:  I am not all the way through yet. But it is every bit as good as ICO, though it is different in many ways. The animation style is the same - much more like actual human movements than video game characters. The Colossi  are HUGE, and immensely challenging to climb. Especially at first when you have no clue how they work. Unlike ICO there is some help available. If you haven't progressed in a Colossus fight for a while, a voice from the heavens will offer a hint. It's usually just something small though, to maybe point out something you missed. There is typically still a lot of work for you to do even after this hint. As I understand it, the 16 Colossi are the ONLY enemies in the entire game. So you can imagine howchallenging each of them are, and how long they can take to fight. But it is AWESOME doing so. The last one I fought was the coolest so far - and this has been the case with each one. They just keep getting better.  This is just my feelings on these games. If you want more info on how they play, and the content, etc., look them up on a gaming reviews site I guess.

I love the way Child goes into detail about the physics of all the evidence that helps Reacher solve the mystery.  I picked up Child years ago by accident.  Now my adult son and all his college roommates read him too.I can't picture Tom Cruise playing Reacher though.He's 5'7\\" with high heels and Reacher is 6'5\\"?  Do the casting people bother to read the books?  They need to find a very physical guy who can act and thus far is unknown.  Cruise will be ridiculous.  Every Reacher fan I have spoken with agrees with me.
B004A8ZWW4|4.0|Folks, \\"Real Steel\\" is the real deal!  This is a 5-star fantastic, funtastic, futuristic movie with a lovely human redemptive plot that gives it focus, meaning and purpose.  It is easy to imagine this becoming a mind-bending rock'em sock'em robot comupter-generated sci-fi geek movie.  But it's not; in fact, it is far from it!  What it is, is a love story that happens to involve fighting robots, and the love story is multi-level and done so well that you'd best have that proverbial box of tissues with you. I guarantee your eyes will water as this film lands a kcockout blow to your heart.<br /><br />Mix 1979's \\"The Champ\\" (relationship of Ricky Schroder and Jon Voight) with 1976's \\"Rocky\\" (relationship of Sylvester Stallone and Talia Shire) and throw in some Rock'em Sock'em robots, and you have a story that will sweep your tech imagination away, while at the same time delivering devastating uppercuts to your heart.<br /><br />I usually do not praise too many movies enthusiastically, but I can't praise this movie enough for scoring one KO after another in terms of acting, casting, script, screenplay, music, drama, and climactic ending.  It's all here, and it leaves you wanting more as the credits roll.<br /><br />The film centers around the evolving relationship between absentee, deadbeat, scam-artist father, Charlie (Hugh Jackman) and betrayed and emotionally distant son Max (Dakota Goyo). Charlie used to be top-ranked boxer and a man people respected, but he lost his self-respect, lost his marriage, lost his only son, and as the movie begins, he is one short step ahead of several loan sharks wanting their money. Charlie's a loser with a capital \\"L\\".  He is still in the fight game, but now boxing involves robots, and Charlie's robots are as junky as he is.  But then fate steps in in the form of his long-lost son, Max, and a new robot called Atom.  Suddenly, the equation of loss that is Charlie's life changes, and the question then becomes one of redemption, not only for Charlie himself, but also for Max and Charlie's girlfriend, Bailey (Evangeline Lilly).  Can Charlie  find the inspiration to fight to save himself, his son, and his future, or will he once again weasle away and and throw everyone under the bus in the process?  No spoilers here!  You have to see this for yourself, and in the process, you will remember this film for a long time to come.  Like me, you will be cheering in the final moments of the film, not only for Atom the robot, who is fighting against virtually insurmountable odds, but also for Charlie, who is fighting against pretty steep odds himself.<br /><br />This film is not deep.  It probably won't win any Academy awards, but it might just win your heart.<br /><br />Rated PG-13 (language).<br /><br />koneso for Max and Charlie's girlfriend, Bailey (Evangeline Lilly).

1400052181|4.0|\\"The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks\\" is a book everyone should read and not just because it concerns an ordinary black woman's extraordinary contribution to science and medicine, but because the book exposes the dark places in the human heart of which both Americans and the world at large need to be reminded.  Yes, man is a wondrous thing, and the nobility of Henrietta Lacks in the face of unbearable physical suffering is testament to that truth, but also apparent in man's legacy are greed, ruthlessness, deception, and monomania as well as corrupt institutions that cry out to be acknowledged for what they did and did not do to fulfill their obligations to humankind in post World War II America.  In the final analysis, this is a dark tale as Skloot shines a light on the machinations, that while they may have moved science forward, destroyed humans with calculated indifference.  It is sobering indeed to realize that our medical establishment performed what anyone would consider atrocities of Mengelean significance on the poor and disenfranchised within the boundaries of what was even then considered \\"the greatest nation on earth.\\"<br /><br />Lacks' significance in medical and scientific parlance is that her cancerous tissue became the first human cells grown in a laboratory.  Subsequently shipped to all parts of the world, these cells were instrumental in various medical discoveries: the Salk Vaccine, cancer research, STD research, AIDS and Immunological research.  Even now the cells of Henrietta Lacks are used to test the efficacy of pharmaceuticals, disease treatments and such progressive practices as cloning and organ transplants.  Her cells specifically targeted such diseases as herpes, leukemia, influenza, hemophilia, Parkinson's Disease, and Malaria.  It is important to note her cells were immortal in the way all cancer cells are, but the fact that hers continued to grow prolifically, enabling so many scientists to use them to further medical research speaks to the significance of her particular tissue, codified as \\"HeLa.\\"  While her cells revolutionized the study of Immunology, for example, they were used without her knowledge or that of her family.  And although they were used for the betterment of science, the mystery surrounding their procurement, their distribution, and their remuneration begs the question of how humane were the medical personnel and the institution, Johns Hopkins Hospital, and by extension America as a whole, in the aftermath of Henrietta Lacks' treatment for cancer of the cervix.<br /><br />Skloot's account makes clear that the rights of black and indigent people in post war America were violated by the unscrupulous practices of doctors, hospitals, and government.  There was no code of ethics that prevented doctors from claiming ownership of a patient's tissue, but more importantly, there were no laws in place to prevent doctors and practitioners from violating the patients they were charged with healing.  As with the famous Tuskegee study of black patients administered vials of venereal disease, so were Hopkins \\"colored\\" similarly abused by the injections of cancer cells without the patients' knowledge or permission.  Even more mysterious in Skloot's account is the question of exactly who or what killed Henrietta Lacks: the cancer she ostensibly acquired through her husband's promiscuity, or the \\"treatment\\" by Johns Hopkins doctors and researchers who saw in the weakened Henrietta a suitable vehicle for medical \\"research\\" and experimentation.  Several studies have shown that black patients during Lacks' time were treated and hospitalized at later stages of their illnesses than were white patients.  Once hospitalized, they got fewer pain medications and had higher mortality rates.  At one point Henrietta's wrists were attached to the hospital bed frame in what was seemingly nothing short of imprisonment.  Skloot's research makes clear that the Jim Crow laws of the fifties were devastating, ensuring as they did, second class citizenship to the black and the disenfranchised living below the Mason-Dixon Line.<br /><br />Skloot, a science writer, discusses medical issues and the specific history of Lacks with knowledge and clarity.  She is informative as to the extent of harm Jim Crow caused black people.  They were admitted to separate parts of the hospital, supervised less by their doctors and nurses, and received less than assiduous Hippocratic accountability.  Although Johns Hopkins was endowed by its wealthy creator to assist the poor, the racism of its employees in pre-Civil Rights America meant that their care was inferior.  There were still colored bathrooms at Hopkins and few hospitals that treated black people.  It was a time of medical and scientific progress, of economic expansion, a time of segregation.  Yet it was also a time that followed on the heels of the medical atrocities committed during the Third Reich, acts condemned and punished by the Nuremburg Trials.  The acts of discrimination and human violation chronicled at Hopkins and Tuskegee were appallingly similar to the atrocities of Auschwitz and Dachau.<br /><br />In telling Lacks' story, Skloot also delves into the family life of the Lacks' in general, throwing open a door on family dysfunction, poverty, and human aberration.  A carrier of Syphillis and Gonnorhea, Henrietta's husband was responsible for Henrietta's cervical cancer, but he was also responsible for the idiocy of their daughter Elsie, who had to be institutionalized.  Skloot illustrates how the Lacks' men worked in the worst locations of the tanker industry, ingesting toxic coal dust and asbestos.  They drank and caroused and were often violent.  Vilified and suspected of unsavory motives by most of the family, the author nevertheless makes it her mission to understand the family, to befriend them and to help them.  Because the family members have so many tumultuous relationships, so much emotional instability and anger, it is a hard road, but she perseveres, revealing in the process the underbelly of fifties black America, where injustice and inequality were all too prevalent, and people lacked hope and the will to rise out of their degradation.<br /><br />Thus is her examination of Henrietta's daughter Deborah an important part of the story, although the time the author devotes to the subject is excessive and the narrative somewhat convoluted and repetitive.  In befriending the angry, volatile, paradoxical Deborah, Skloot lays bare the emotional impact of both racism and specifically Henrietta's mistreatment at the hands of white America.  Deborah Lacks is an emotional wreck, as are much of the Lacks' family, suggesting the conflicting emotions and particular legacy of Henrietta, the dead mother of five children - orphaned children destined never to find a home, a sanctuary from the injustice of losing their mother before she had time to prepare them for the unfairness of the world at large or to teach them how to cope with it.  This part of the  book is bogged down in detail and dialogue among people still mourning, people who don't make a lot of sense at times and whose history is uncomfortable to read about and whose angry outbursts speak to the devastating effects of poverty and racial injustice.<br /><br />The book does many things.  It provides a history of the woman, Henrietta Lacks.  It reveals the separate but equal practices that fueled black anger.  It illustrates the lack of ethics in medicine at the time and identifies some of the medical field's most ruthless operatives and institutions.  More importantly, it reveals the hypocrisy of America in general as it pulls away the scab to reveal the pus of poisoned human beings, living in squalor and conflict so close to their white counterparts in a go-go economy but separate nevertheless and certainly not equal.  In that sense it suggests the dark side of capitalism, \\"progress,\\" institutions, and human motivation.  In the years following America's terrible awareness of Nazi criminality, it is amazing to me that we took such a giant step backward in the practice of humane treatment of all ethnicities and races, that our country that had liberated millions from the iron mantle of the Third Reich could stoop to such degrading practices, rather than further human rights and assist the underclass to evolve.

Granted, I don't agree with everything Mrs. Chua says, but that didn't stop me from enjoying this book tremendously.<br /><br />And, for everyone who is criticizing her out there, it's just as she writes at some point: there are as many unhappy western kids as there are asian ones, so it's not as if the Chinese education is destroying the children's lives! The road to success is hard, and Mrs. Chua gave 110% to be with her daughters and help them get to the top of everything they do. If that isn't love, I don't know what it is.
B0050VJ29Y|3.0|This album is different. I like Danger Mouse and I really want to like this album, but since purchasing I've listened to it maybe 5 times. It just doesn't hold my interest. It is a good attempt at something different but not good enough to earn a permanent place on my iPhone. That stated, the album isn't awful, and I'd recommend people at least listen to the samples to see if this album is up their alley.

B004BJMEO6|5.0|This movie is fantastic, the writing, the camera work, the soundtrack, but the best part is Traci and Necar.  They are perfect in these roles and act this so amazingly well, you don't even know they are acting.  They really nailed the emotion..Traci's character trying not to fall for Elena and Necar's character..trying to understand the feelings and the confusion of those feelings with everything she thought she knew. I felt the anguish. Really outstanding by both beautiful ladies.  The direction is so good, so glad you went with the cut you did.  Just saw the extras and glad you left out the emailing (a little to Ive Got Mail for my taste) and glad you decided against the losing the child story line.  It is perfect just being about the two title characters and their emotions to each other.  So rich, so full of so much.  Been looking for good lesbian cinema and with Desert Hearts, Its in the Water and I Can't Think Straight, this one has shot to the top of the list. Thanks to everyone involved, especially the two lead actresses, you really made a fantastic movie that all of you should be so proud of.  Can't wait for the next one from Soulkiss - anybody have the rights to Curious Wine, would love to see Nicole tackle that one.   Thanks again,  Kubi
0061733199|5.0|This book is an awesome book to bring on a hiking trip, or to just have lying in your backpack somewhere. The book is a well written survival book, with not to much information, but just about enough you would need to withstand any situation that has some liknyness of happening. I really like the book, cause it has a lot of tips for camp-crafting, and also for how to do things you before didn't have the knowledge to do. The best of all is that what the book describes actually works. The health section I have yet to try out, so I cant rate the health section, but everything else deserves 5 stars. Another thing with the book is that its great to know that you have your rescue in your bag at all times, so you are prepared for anything. Great for In Case of Emergency situations!

B0038AL7M4|5.0|[[ASIN:B0038AL7M4 Spirits of the Dead (Histoires extraordinaires) [Blu-ray]]]This is a clarification rather than a full review: several reviewers have indicated that only the French dubbed version of Toby Dammit (Fellini's contribution to this anthology) is available on this Blu-Ray disc.  That is INCORRECT!  The original Italian and English soundtrack is included on this version, and the French dub is also included as another soundtrack option.  If you buy this disc, you will in fact have the pleasure of hearing Terence Stamp deliver his lines in all their lunatic, English glory--and my guess is that the reviews listed under this Blu-Ray were originally from some other release of the film that did not have the Italian-English soundtrack for Toby Dammit; either Amazon goofed by using reviews of an older release in their listing of this Blu-Ray, or the reviewers have mistaken this Blu-Ray release for an older release of the film.

B0053YGYO4|3.0|Having spent a lot of time driving this last week, I've probably listened through the album 10 times.  For me, the song has a few memorable songs, but unfortunately they have been played to death over the last six months.  The remaining collection is either overproduced, uninspired or an experiment that should not have mad the cd.  I know that bands want to change and grow, but this leaves Coldplay as a band searching for an identity after that had a pretty strong one on past efforts.

B002HFJ77S|3.0|I love Sophie Kinsella, but this novel is not my favorite.  While I loved the imaginative premise, I did not care for the character of Sadie.  I found her too much of a \\"me girl\\" curmudgeon. She got on my nerves. At times, I didn't root for Lara to help Sadie.  Also, I felt that Ms. Kinsella could have had more fish-out-water situations/humor.  Sadie adapts too quickly and easily to the 21st century;  I would have liked to seen her react more to all the technological and social media phenomenon that never existed in the l920's. Overall, it was an enjoyable read, but not the hilarious page turner I expect from Ms. Kinsella.
B0053YGYO4|2.0|Oh, how long it's been since 2003 since Coldplay released their sophmore effort \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\". An ambitious and effective record that clearly is Chris Martin's crowning achievement. It's not that the band has regressed since the 2003 release. 2008 \\"Viva la Vida, Death and all it's Friends\\" was a great rebound from a rather generic effort of \\"X and Y\\". Like \\"X and Y\\", \\"Mylo Xyloto\\" suffers from over production, and the band tries too hard to expand to different territories when they should stick to what they do well.  There are only two tracks on this album that are really good. \\"U.F.O\\" (which has a beautiful melody) and \\"Paradise\\". \\"Hurts like Heaven\\" and \\"Princess of China\\" are arguably their worst material to date. The rest of the songs are generic, even their first single \\"Every teardrop is a Waterfall\\" is extremely so-so. I can only hope after another 3-5 year break that the band rebounds to another great effort.   Must Hear: U.F.O, Paradise  Skip: Princess of China, Hurts like Heaven, (The whole rest of the album that is not mentioned in the must hear section)

B0051UP5NQ|5.0|After recently paying for a similar app, I decided to try this one when it was free on Amazon. Immediately after opening I noticed many differences that I enjoyed, the main one being that all of the settings were well labeled and easily identified. It also opened large files that were too big for the other program to open. It also appeared to have more options for formulas and fonts.   This app is definitely worth a test run!
B005GVA2L0|5.0|The compelling question on my mind when going to listen to this record is- Can the band still be Evanescence if all the original members are gone except Amy? Although debatable I was willing to give the album its chance, after all, the 2003 release of \\"Fallen\\" really changed me as it did many others. In the listening I found that the album stands on its own is I dare say is a solid piece of work, and trust me, I had some real doubts about it before I heard it. You can tell Amy and the new band have been working on this long and hard. Gone is the experimental sound that was on \\"The Open Door\\" and is replaced with a rockish and electronica atmosphere. Soaring beautiful vocals from Amy could not be better. I for one am happy for the change as \\"The Open Door\\" was interesting but was so so to me. The record comes with a DVD that shows the making of their first video and Amy Lee explaining where some of the songs came from and what her thoughts on them are. I thought it was interesting. The music CD comes with 12 full tracks and four bonus songs that in my opinion could have just as easily been true tracks. I couldn't tell any difference of quality from the so called 12 tracks and the bonus songs, they all rock. As a musician listening to this album, it's clear that Amy Lee knows her music theory as all throughout the songs there are breaks, pre-choruses, and changes all throughout that kept me interested. Hands down 'My Heart is Broken,' track 4, is my favorite song on the album and it now goes into my favorite song categories. 'Lost in Paradise,' track 7 brought me to tears the first time I heard it and it still has that effect. 16 songs of the new Evanescence and the bonus DVD, yes please. Totally worth it.
0553801473|5.0|Well he's back, and with the same flare that made Storm of Swords so gripping. Was it worth the wait?  Yes and no. I'm still mad about waiting over ten years for two books, one of which was not very good (the one before this), but this book is not like Feast of Crows, this is a return to the character depth, haunting scenes, internal struggles, and amazing world building imagination that made him so great in the first place. If it were a matter of having a half ass story and not having to weight so many years, or having this, I would go with this and accept the wait with ill mastered patience. But please, don't do that to us again George.
0312370849|4.0|I don't know what to say about this book. Enough people have written about the story itself. This was an extremely emotional read for me. NOT Julia's story, which I found pretty tedious, but Sarah's. I never knew about this. I have never heard about this. I feel ashamed of myself, our educational system, and our media that I have never heard of this. How is this possible?! Are there political reasons this is not taught in American schools? You read all these reviews and here are people from all different areas saying \\"I never knew about this.\\" For this reason, I am giving the book 4 stars. I would hate to think someone doing the 'quick star' assessment of the book might skip over it.  Someone who, like me, did not even know about this awful, awful event. This story needs to be told and remembered...for the children and their families.

0765350386|5.0|I gave the series a shot after reading Way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson. I didn't think it would match the quality of the Way of Kings, but I hoped it would at least be close. I am astounded by his imagination, and driving plot, even the drama scenes grabbed me as if they were action sequences. Mistborn was much more than I expected - it was what I hoped but didn't think could be delivered. Never did the story switch story POVs just to move the story forward or string the reader along while squeezing in a few more chapters. Somehow, the book never let up, never left the scenes where I wanted to be, and was filled with constantly changing, novel, intense scenes of action, battle, and matrix like magical freedom.
B004Y8Y26C|4.0|So I watched the movie last night and all day today I've had the Hanna's Theme song stuck in my head so I decided to check out the soundtrack.  I've been a fan of the Chemical Brothers for many years so when I found out it was their work I decided to buy the album (though not from Amazon).  The wikipedia page for the sound track says it was criticized for lack of innovation.  Having just finished my first listen of the album I would agree that it does have a bit of a dated sound to it but that is my only complaint, a very good sound track otherwise.  That song Hanna's Theme has got to be one of the \\"catchyest\\" songs I've ever heard I simply can't stop it from rattling around my brain, I think it could be used for psychological war far.<br /><br />If you enjoyed this soundtrack check out the Tron Legacy soundtrack done by Daft Punk.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|3 classic sci-fi masterpieces that will live on and on!  I have absolutely adored these movies since I was a kid, and could not even tell you the countless times I have watched them over the years.  There may have been a few little things changed over the years, a couple of things that were maybe a little disappointing, but overall they are the same great flicks from way back when...essential musts for any good sci-fi movie collection.  Definitely Blu-Ray upgrade worthy!
B0055SWM08|5.0|All the hundreds of rave reviews of this game are accurate, so I won't repeat them.  On my tablet in landscape the display is almost always upside down and can't be corrected.  I've never had this issue with any other of my 100+ apps.<br /><br />Update:  The display orientation issue was corrected with an update after I first posted my review.  Often Android app updates on Amazon lag well behind the updates in the Google Play store, and that appeared to be the case here.  Anyway, it's all good now.
B000PMG16U|5.0|As most Star Wars fans would agree, the original Star Wars trilogy, episodes IV-VI, are and will always be the best Star Wars films ever!  Episodes I-III weren't quite the same.  However, that being said, they are still pretty epic...especially episode III!  If you're a Star Wars fan, the original trilogy is definitely the best, but the prequel trilogy is still awesome and fills in the story of what came to be quite well I think.  The only part of episodes I-III that I honestly did not care much for was Jar Jar Binks.  What a waste of space & budget, I'm sorry to say.  I did find it rather enjoy it when he got his head caught in the pod racer beam in episode I though...that was pretty funny.  Otherwise, I thought he was absolutely worthless.  Despite that, I still couldn't bring myself to give these films any less than 5 stars, because they are still pretty epic and worthy to be in any good sci-fi movie collection.
0316056863|3.0|I went into this book hoping for a glimpse into Tina's life along with amusement, and, hopefully, some laugh out loud moments. I'm sad to say I was pretty disappointed. While there were some amusing parts overall I found the book to be pretty dull. I became so uninterested that mid-way through the book I started reading another book (Kathy Griffin's memoir, which I really enjoyed), before coming back to finish it. One thing that really annoyed me was her references to people I've never heard of. I'm 29 so I'm not her age, but I'm not that young either and, with the exception of Suzanne Sommers, I had no idea who ANY of the people she referred to were. That really prevented me from being able to get into the story. To each their own, but I think this is maybe worth checking out at the library, at best.
B0050QV0RQ|4.0|great old school rpg! however, it is a little hard to move your character around...you will be &quot;caught of guard&quot; in battles on a regular basis simply because it is hard to move the character around on the map. you cant compare your equipment when you buy new gear at the weapons shop. And getting into the air ship is very difficult at times.   other than the character movement controls, its a great game. should take you about 15-20 hours to complete and there is a second play through that allows you to keep all your stats and equipment. definately worth the money for anyone that loves rpg's and doesnt mind the movement controls!
B004LROUNG|3.0|Unfortunately, my review for this Grisham book is just about the same as it would be for the last several of his novels.    He's a great writer; there's no question about that.  He has a writing style that pulls you in, captivates you and makes you continue reading.  I anxiously anticipate his novels and keep hoping....  On the down side, there's just not much meat.  I think back to his older books like The Firm and The Partner and remember them (perhaps I should re-read them?) as being substantive and weighty.  Most of the later novels read like romance novels where you get a couple hundred pages tied up in a neat little bow at the end.  It's worth reading, but definitely less than he is capable of producing.
1423140591|4.0|Just what you expect of Percy Jackson. My only complaint - and my husband agrees with me - is how abrupt the ending is. We know that there will be another book coming out in the series, or several books most likely; but we both hoped we would at the least get to see the reunion of Percy and Annabeth as well as the meeting between Percy and Jason.
B000000OSG|5.0|In the midst of backbiting, an out of control rock press, and internal band tensions, Guns N' Roses return to create an epic album anchored by the stellar Civil War, Knocking On Heavens Door, Get In The Ring, and Estranged. Axl and company gave the rock world a standered to live up to in the fall of 1991. Slash is superb throughout the entire album, his solos and chords have substance and panache. Halfway through the making of the album, drummer Steven Adler was fired by Rose for failure to give up his cocaine addiction. It is unfortunate that such a talented drummer fell victim to drug abuse. He was replaced by Matt Sorum, an equally talented musician who filled his role very well. Izzy Stradlin would also be fired the very next year for the same reason. It is amazing that G N'R were able to stay creative in the backdrop of so many personal problems and baggage. Regardless, the band managed to produce a gem of 14 songs that still sound fresh after the passing of 20 years. Hopefully, Axl will eventually be able to swallow his enormous ego and put together a much needed and enthusiastically embraced reunion tour. I would hope that he has reached the age where he realizes that life isn't all about him and what he wants. The band should put aside their differences and give fans what they have been waiting for for the last twenty years.
0385535139|4.0|THis is the best Grisham in a long time.  THe ambulance chasing partners who make up the firm of Finley and Figg along with their street tough, long suffering secretary are a delight.  Along comes young David Zinc who is burned out at his job at a prestigious law firm and who wants to start his career again.  Mix them all together and you have a engrossing story that I could barely stand to put down.  I read it in a day and a half.
1400069181|5.0|This book is perfect for anyone who is interested in either learning more about TOMS and the One for One movement or for people who are thinking about starting something of their own. Start Something That Matters is very accessible and an interesting read. Sometimes these books drag, but Blake Mycoskie has done a very good job at keeping the readers attention and providing useful information. The stories in here are amazing and inspirational. I would recommend this book for anyone who is interested in social entrepreneurship or simply in learning about the background of some amazing businesses.
B004TTMYQG|1.0|Purchased on Amazon, about $5 for the app.  App loads without any calendars; main screen loads with two fields, both of which are supposed to contain calendars in different formats.  Both fields in my software are empty.  When I go to look at my apps, I notice the program does not show as an installed program.  Not sure what is wrong but contacting Amazon has so far done nothing fix the issue.
B0041QSZJM|5.0|I was amazed to hear the sound quality that was so great on this CD.  Very nice music.  Top quality.
0374105235|5.0|My son did a book report for school on this book. He's 14. Very good story and a little sad.
B005MSD75U|1.0|I hated this movie, kept fast-forwarding it to get through it and find something of value.  The animal voices were irritating at best, the jokes vulgar and disgusting.  Just no redeeming value at all.  Nothing funny about it.  Don't waste your time or your money on this garbage!  The writers should be ashamed of wasting so much money producing such a waste of time, then promoting it as a great funny movie.
B0035WRY7C|1.0|I found this book to be an insufferable bore. I read exactly half the book then gave up on it. The descriptions are bland and at times awkward and don't make sense. The characters have no personality. I don't understand why these books have high reviews. If you want good story-telling and memorable characters then just read Harry Potter because this book just does not cut it.
0060872675|3.0|There's this book called [[ASIN:0060815310 Thud!]] by Terry Pratchett.<br /><br />You may have heard of it.  You might not have heard of the specific book, but perhaps heard of the author.<br /><br />Maybe you read some of his books.  If you read this book, you might need to have read [[ASIN:0060815310 Thud!]].<br /><br />The problem is, even if you have read [[ASIN:0060815310 Thud!]] you might have some misgivings with this book.<br /><br />If you haven't read [[ASIN:0060815310 Thud!]], let me give you a quick rundown.  Basically the Trolls and the Dwarfs are eternal and mortal enemies.  They keep reliving and refighting the past.  One battle has been fought at least thirteen times, the Battle of Koom Valley.  The titular Thud is the name of a skill game that replicates the eternal war: like chess or Mousetrap. What's really important is that Commander Sam Vimes has to, and I mean HAS TO read the book \\"Where's My Cow\\" to his son Sam every day at six.  I know it sounds crazy, but it is an imperative.  I still know it sounds crazy, but that's what comes from the mind of Terry Pratchett.  You're still doubting my sanity, so I have to tell you that the requirement that the book be read forms part of the climax of that book.<br /><br />The thing is, this book [[ASIN:0060872675 Where's My Cow?]] is not that book \\"Where is My Cow?\\". This book has parts of the other book in it, but this is more an interesting and fleeting examination on the nature of fatherhood and the bond between father and son (with a 'meta' twist).  You do get to see some of the characters that make up the beloved world of the novel in graphical form.  Apparently for example, Lord Vetinari looks like Will Shakespeare.  However, I don't know who the audience is for the book.  It is too layered for young kids and too clever by half in a way.  Done in minutes, it isn't worth the time for adults versus the money you'll spend.  Do what I did, and find it at your library.  It is worth it, but only just.
B0050CJNJ2|4.0|If you liked the first 2 albums then Lady Antebellum's 3rd installment is not going to be a disappointment! Personal favourites on this one are tracks 1, 2, 6 and 12.
B0053KWDES|4.0|I've been using my Bose QC15 headphone for iPod classic and I was curious if the quality of sound might improve if I buy this. I read in the internet that QC15 has a high impedance (Bose don't put their specs on the box). So I gave it a shot, ordering FiiO E11 was a good deal it made my music better sounding, I can feel bass getting powered up and not that muddy overall it sounds livelier than before. No hiss or any noise noted.   The size is smaller than iPod classic and the rubber band is enough to hold both items without falling or sliding. Sturdy looking and decent.  The only thing I noticed is that when you put it together with iPod (I am using L9 cable by FiiO) it's hard to control the volume knob. But after some time maybe I'll get used to it, not a big deal.  Update: 11/24/2011  Still working good with my headphones. I can hear a difference in sound using Bose QC 15, but if I plug my ATH M50 it does not alter the sound (due to low impedance).  If I plug my Shure earphones the sound is distorted and unbearable.
0446547654|1.0|Don't waste your time or money. This is one of the most predictable story lines I have seen by any major writer. Disappointing is an understatement of my thoughts of this publication. Sparks is a wonderfully talented writer, whom I have enjoyed for many years. This overly dramatic, over written tragedy offers little that will add to the laurels of a wonderful writer. This story is long winded and overly descriptive. I gave two copies of this story as gifts before reading it myself. Now I wish I had not been so quick to send the gifts.
0439023483|5.0|I do not normally post reviews on things but this book was amazing.  It is one of those books that grab you from page one and does not let go until the end of book three.  I have read all three books and am going back and rereading them.  I have recommended this book to all my family and friends and say it is a must read.
B004I8WD6E|4.0|I thought this would be thinner -- migrating from an incipio feather 3GS barely-there case -- but, still, it's very good, especially for the low price.  The screen protector that comes with it is also nice.  All in all, no problems, and I'm still using it.  It fit the 4S just fine, quite snug.  The 4S plus the extra size from the case makes it fit my car's mount excellently.  The odd patterning on the back doesn't bother me, since I spend most of my time looking at the front of the phone anyway.  I think they actually have more functionality on the front of the phone, and this is probably part of the design of the phone overall.  The cutouts are ample for the functions, including plugging dock connectors into it.  If you have a universal dock (with the changeable iphone base cutout thingie), there's a good chance this fits it, with the case on, if you just accidentally forget to put any of the changeable dock inserts into it.  This doesn't really free up those inserts for anything else -- I'm afraid they're useless elsewhere, so go ahead an put them in the junk drawer in your kitchen with all the other useless things that you think you'll use again some day.
B000N3ST8O|5.0|This package is awesome and a must-own even if you already have 'Timespace' and 'Enchanted.'  The inclusion of \\"Sorcerer\\" and \\"Planets of the Universe\\" on a retrospective is a must because they were great singles from 2001's 'Trouble in Shangri-La.'  Deep Dish's remix of \\"Dreams,\\" with new vocals from Stevie was great; the original \\"Silver Springs\\" really isn't all that special to this set because it's on Fleetwood Mac's 4-Disc retrospective, 'The Chain,' from 1992, 'The Very Best of Fleetwood Mac' from 2003 and the two-disc reissue of 'Rumours' from 2004.  Live versions of \\"Landslide\\" and \\"Edge of Seventeen\\" with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra are rare treats.  The DVD is also amazing.  I love the commentaries by Stevie on each of the videos as well as the \\"home video\\" from 1981 during the 'Bella Donna' sessions.  One must be careful, though, not to call this a complete music video collection of her solo stuff; it is not complete.  Two notable exclusions are the original music video filmed (though rarely seen) for \\"Edge of Seventeen\\" and her 1998 solo collaboration with Sheryl Crow, \\"If You Ever Did Believe,\\" for the motion picture 'Practical Magic.'  I'm not sure why \\"If You Ever Did Believe\\" was not included.  It's also quite a tragedy that she never made a video for \\"Planets of the Universe,\\" which was a far better single than \\"Sorcerer\\" or \\"Every Day,\\" and was even remixed into a #1 hit on the club charts.
B0053YGYO4|2.0|Well Paradise is a decent song I guess for this album. I kind of felt this was going to happen the last album was headed here. If you want real Coldplay just buy the First 3 LPs. \\"Parachutes\\" is by far their best effort to date but the 1st always is. It takes a artist 20 years to make there first record. There sound just keeps getting blander and blander happier and happier after X & Y.  Where are the songs like \\"LOST\\" on here or \\"CLOCKS\\"? They are where they are today because of there smooth and beautiful lush dark sound. And look at what they are doing now commercial music. The last album will be my last purchase from them and this one will not get purchased. It just doesn't sound like the band I fell in love with. This is a imposter standing in not the real thing at all.
B003L77GG0|5.0|This review is more for season 10 itself.  I think after nine seasons, after starting off in one place and really taking the series (and its characters) to places fans probably never thought it/they would go, expectations for the tenth season were undoubtedly sky high and in my opinion that's why a lot of people have given some negative reviews about some parts of the season.  The only episode I allowed myself to have any real expectation for was \\"Finale.\\"  I've been through this before; The seventh season of 'Charmed' and a good portion of season eight was fantastic, but my expectations to tie up so many loose ends that final season let me down.  Same with Buffy and Angel ... So I promised myself I would not create any expectations in my mind of what the final season should be.  I approached it like it was not the final season.  Doing that allowed me to enjoy each episode (some were not as good, admittedly, but every season of every show has its weaker episodes).  I'll give the writers and producers (and especially the cast) credit; they really do CRAM A LOT in these twenty-one episodes (\\"Finale\\" is two hours).  Annette O'Toole and John Schneider (Martha and Jonathan Kent) make touching returns; John Glover's return is absolutely chilling as he reinvents Lionel as a nemesis, not the soft(er)-hearted sometimes-villain he had become prior to falling to his death at the end of the seventh season.  James Marsters rocked as Brainiac 5, and Laura Vandervoort's episode, though one of the weaker of the season, showed a Kara that had grown since we'd seen her last.  Callum Blue's return as Zod (who know ruled the Phantom Zone) was one of my favorites.  Appearances in \\"Finale\\" by Michael Rosenbaum (always fabulous as Lex Luthor) and Aaron Ashmore as the real Jimmy Olson.  Most of all I was happy Allison Mack came back for six episodes, book-ending the season with Chloe sacrificing herself to save Oliver and playing a solid role in the finale, as it should have been.  I'll admit I was a bit ticked that Mack did not sign on as a regular for the full season, especially considering she was lasted longer than any other cast member on the show (except Tom Welling, of course), but ultimately I think it was fitting.  After years of taking a back seat to Kristin Kreuk's Lana Lang, Mack really proved her worth during seasons eight and nine as the show's female lead.  Chloe Sullivan had more real character development in those two seasons than seasons five, six, and seven combined.  It was fitting, though, that she step aside and hand the role of female lead to Erica Durance (the best Lois Lane ever, in my opinion) for the final season.  Justin Hartley (Oliver Queen) and Cassidy Freeman (Tess Mercer) were brilliant in their roles; Freeman really rocked this season and held her own in a scenes with with Michael Rosenbaum and John Glover.  Though seasons eight and nine are my favorite, season ten is awesome and I highly recommend it.

B005NNUKF4|3.0|I'll keep this short, the music speaks for its self. It's a masterpiece. This review is about the \\"remaster\\" and re-release of material that has been \\"remastered\\" and re-released in the past.   Rule number one to keep in mind, don't believe the hype. There is only so much that can be done to an 1970's analog master recordings to improve its sound . The end product is only as good as the range and fidelity or the master and remember the sound quality of the 1970's master will never, ever equal a modern digitally recorded music. Period, end of story. Any improvement in this \\"remaster\\" go around is slight, very slight. I am a critical listener and I am not sure the very slight improvement justifies spending money on yet another copy of Dark Side Of The Moon. Any references to \\"vinyl quality\\" sound should be taken with a grain of salt. I am from the vinyl age, I am an audiophile and I can tell you the vinyl sound quality was extremely hard to come by. Crap pressing, cheap materials, warping, dust pops all interfered with critical listening.  Any references to \\"sounds as good as vinyl\\"  should be thought of as nostalgia only. Vinyl never could equal a digitally recorded CD for sound quality. The cheap paper packaging of the \\"re-release\\" is complete junk. A jjewel case with the original packaging and artwork, inside pictures and original record label printed on the CD would have been much more interesting for new fans to view along with an additional enhancements  than this thin paper CD holder junk. It has all the appearances of not being thought about at all and nothing more than a  straight up money grab by the record label and The Floyd.
0446585025|2.0|I will be the first to say that I am Ellen's #1 fan.  I love her show and she just makes me smile and want to dance...This book just was a bummer to me.  I felt like I was reading about absolutely nothing and wasting my time.  I tried and tried to like this book but actually didn't even finish it.  I got so frustrated reading about nothing that I am going to have to pass the book on to somebody else. I hate writing negative reviews but this book really wasn't worth the money to me.
B005J4TLQG|4.0|Directed by Edgar Wright pal Joe Cornish, Attack the Block is a gleefully enjoyable British alien romp.  When scores of vicious, glow-in-the-dark-toothed alien beasts descend upon the Block, a group of teen thugs wind up getting caught in the crossfire and trying to survive.  With numerous odes to John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 among others, Attack the Block doesn't offer anything we haven't seen before, but it doesn't try to either.  Instead, its sole focus is to deliver enjoyable, bloody thrills with some great dialogue and acting showcases, and it works for what it is.  Also featuring the always-enjoyable Nick Frost (Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Paul) in a great, albeit brief, role that shines while it lasts.
B0034G4ORC|2.0|Battle: Los Angeles is two hours I wish I had gotten back. It is a gritter War of the Worlds type miltary type battle.<br /><br />Aaron Eckhart (Harvey Two Face from The Dark Knight) does an impressive job of spitting out ham-fisted dialogue like he really, really means it in a John Wayne type mode. He is the highlight of the whole film. His Marine  Staff Sergeant  headed to the way of retirement may be the only reason you may want to watch this film. Otherwise, the Poor character development and a worn out storyline make this a very forgettable film otherwise.<br /><br />Charlie's Angels Ramon Rodriguez and Lost's Michelle Rodriquez seem wasted in their supporting roles.<br /><br />The humans vs Aliens type storyline seem weak. I blame the story, not the filmmaker. However, the film is so gritty that you cannot keep up who is who.<br /><br />I suggest you miss this Battle<br /><br />Bennet Pomerantz<br />AUDIOWORLD
B0028ER4PU|4.0|I don't know maybe underrated isn't the right word as The Doors are a classic rock band and everything they've done has been reviewed and listened to to death.<br />Anyway, I wasn't always a fan of Morrison hotel I thought it was sort of all over the place with some very strong songs like Peace Frog/ Blue Sunday and Roadhouse Blues and some songs that sounded as though they weren't all there like Queen of the Highway and You Make Me Real (I still like the live version more). But as time has past I've been seduced by the LP, Maggie M'Gill is a great bluesy song to end the album, The Spy is creepy and cool, Waiting for the Sun is classic Doors, Indian Summer is a dreamy croon. It still has a slightly disjointed feel but the pieces that make up the whole make this a great listen, totally enjoyable and a little badass!

B002BWP4A6|5.0|All I can say is that, although the film is slow paced, at the end I didn't want to get up, I wished the film to continue for at least 2-3 more hours. I saw it 3 times at the local cinema and now, after almost 2 years, on DVD. This is my favorite Michael Haneke's film.
B005XOPEOU|1.0|I have to start by saying that I read a lot of the reviews before I bought.  Much like anything else, they were all over the board.  Of course, differing views are what make us human, so this was no surprise.  I must also say that I am a big Cold Play fan, owning all of their previous albums.  Many of them I have listened to dozens if not hundreds of times.  So I was salivating with antici......pation for this new CD.<br /><br />What others have said is very true.  The advertised \\"something different\\" just isn't there.  Although, I am a music lover, and don't consider Cold Play to be what I call a \\"chameleon\\" band like Guster or The Dandy Warhols (who I also love)--you never know what you will get with a new album of theirs, and that is a signature element of their appeal.  Cold Play not so much.  You buy a Cold Play album expecting sweeping epic orchestral tunes with thought provoking lyrics.<br /><br />And I agree with others that the mixing of these tunes is just god awful.  Sub par at best.  At least Cold Play hasn't jumped on the over modulated voice tracks that most pop songs have these days.  But with as awful as these tracks sound it wouldn't have surprised me if it would have been there.  The addition of Riahanna on Princess Of China doesn't even help in my opinion.  Her voice is pretty much wasted here.<br /><br />The addition of the tune-lets that are under a minute is a recurring Cold Play irritation.  In my opinion,they just break up the rythym of even their better works, and certainly don't improve this one either.<br /><br />I can honestly say that there isn't a stand out \\"love it!!\\" song.  Not even one I like very much.  I'm not sure it will even get listened to again.<br /><br />I have listened to this album in its entirety three times already, once in my car-with a kick ass premium 8 speaker Bose system-which makes listening to Viva La Vida a nearly religious experience.  Even with the great stereo, it still sounds like total garbage. The songs and the production are a one-two punch of embarrassing mediocrity.  I have a feeling this one will get tossed in the back seat.  Destined to be found by the detail guys when I trade in my car someday.  Along with my Fred Schneider solo album and my Palm Pilot.  Two other things that despite the hype, proved to be less than useful in my life.<br /><br />It almost feels like this album was produced using Project Runway restrictions.<br /><br />Heidi Klum:  Musicians, you have 5 weeks and $9,000 to produce a 14 song collection.<br /><br />Tim Gunn:  Alright everyone, you have 30 minutes to caucus, 45 minutes to compose, and then we're off to the garage where you may use the parts of previous songs to build your collection.  Remember, you can't use any outside help, or hire a professional for any of the design elements.  You may, however, use one guest performer for one of your songs. Make it work!<br /><br />IMHO-Coldpay, You're Out!!! Auf Wiedershen!arrassing mediocrity.  I have a feeling this one will get tossed in the back seat.

B005NPBTQ6|3.0|OH, man, Whiskeytown!  THat was a band.  It kept dude from being self-indulgent.  But that said, the more time passes, the more albums like \\"Heartbreaker\\" and \\"Gold\\" seem like strange gifts (\\"Cold Roses\\" is also excellent; would be astounding if the strong songs were put together on one album).  This album is okay.  It's soft.  It's about as good as \\"Jacksonville City Nights.\\"  But after a couple weeks no particular song is grabbing me.  Maybe it's that I've changed?  Still, if I were close to Ryan and believed he'd listen, I'd let him know that he's not a great falsetto singer and he should really avoid that entirely.
1400069181|4.0|As a business owner with a shelf full of inspirational business titles, this one isn't revolutionizing my way of life or anything. But it's a fun read.<br /><br />Blake seems like the kind of decent, fun-loving guy that we all want to have as a friend. He's casual, and probably started as an entrepreneur because he would have gotten fired had he tried to work for someone else long-term. He's kind of goofy, and doesn't shy away from telling us all what didn't work! This makes it an entertaining read, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.<br /><br />But the real question is, did I get anything out of it that I can apply to my own small landscaping business? And while I had fun with Blake, the answer is no, not really. He is obviously heavily inspired by people like Tim Ferriss and Seth Godin, and does a decent job summarizing their insights and how he put them into play. But given that I have read Godin's and Ferriss' work, reading Blake's summaries of their philosophies didn't really do much for me. It was like hanging out with a friend who has read the same book, and going, \\"yeah, that was awesome, what he said about x\\".<br /><br />The really new thing Blake is bringing is his own personal passion for helping people. And this is inspiring to read, but if you have already started a business (like my landscaping company), and it isn't built around a charitable model (it's not), I didn't really see any suggestions for how I could change my business to incorporate the elements that made his business work. Am I meant to add some program where I share my slim profits with people in another country and somehow send my employees there to see all the good my extra few grand a year is causing? Um, not really practical.<br /><br />I would have really liked some creative ideas about how normal people with normal businesses are meant to put this stuff into action, because I want to help people and fire up my employees with passion for being charitable, but I'm not seeing exactly how I might go in that direction in the way Blake has.<br /><br />I think this new trend of having successful CEOs write business books is kind of a cool one, but between this one and Tony Hseih's book, I'm not really feelin' it thus far. Both this and Hseih's book were fun reads (like a novel about goofy screwups who succeed in spite of themselves), but offered little practical value for small business owners in today's economy.<br /><br />I'm giving this four stars because I did thoroughly enjoy it. If you're looking for a fun bedtime read that will make you chuckle, this is a good one. If you're looking for practical wisdom that will give you a new edge in business, try The Four Hour Workweek, Purple Cow, or anything by Dan Kennedy (his time management book is killer).ake has.

B004T9R218|4.0|Okay, so i have no knowledge of investing. This book gave me some thoughts on how i could invest and what skills would be valuable to accomplishing this goal. I liked how it presented the difference between wealth and being rich. My goal is wealth, a.k.a making enough money from my investments so that my home/car payments are paid. If i can do more than that, great. If not? i work and use the excess for myself or invest until it becomes enough to cover those payments.I feel this book as definetly opened my eyes towards investing and therefore would recommend this book to most people i know, because most know absolutely nothing about investing (which is what this book says) and this would at the least help them start on their journey to figuring out how to make their money work for them.
B0045EJY90|1.0|I purchased this as a transport device, meaning that I have a separate DAC that converts the digital to analog. Note that in order to by-pass the internal DAC on a CD player it must have a digital out, the analog out is already converted by the CD player.<br /><br />Additionally  the ability to use as an input device for a remote MP3 player (like an iPod) and also to burn MP3 TO the USB out is great and easy to use.<br /><br />So why not the TEAC 890 CD Burner (higher cost  [[ASIN:B0045EJZRQ TEAC CD-RW890 CD Recorder with Remote (Black)]] - It doesn't have a digital out and thus you must use the internal DAC on this unit. That significantly limits the unit for those looking for a better DAC.<br /><br />What about the  TEAC P1260 CD player (lower cost) [[ASIN:B000GU8B28 TEAC CD-P1260 CD Player with LCD and MP3 Playback]] - the same problem, no digital out.<br /><br />If you don't care about digital out for a remote DAC - then my advice is this:<br /><br />P1260 for a CD player with the ability to plug in an MP3 player.<br />890 CD burner - if you want to burn MP3s.<br /><br />However - This unit does both - it burns MP3 (not to DISC - but to USB) and it also has the digital out for a remote DAC.<br /><br />If you are looking for a great transport (for remote DAC) - this is a great product for the cost and functionality.<br /><br />EDIT: OCT 2012 (just one year) and this CD player stop reading discs. I called and emailed TEAC customer support, which didn't help at all. The guy on the phone thought it was my discs, but I told them they had ALL played before. Then he said he thought the unit may have over heated and asked how long it had been on, REALLY? He was useless and gave me another number to call, which didn't help. The unit is out of warranty and TEAC customer service sucks.  I had someone else look at it (who has built -hi-fi equipment) and said the transport mechanism is plastic and not well designed and the motor is weak. It just can't keep a constant or strong speed to get the laser to read. After looking it over, he concluded it was crap (drive, mechanism, and motor).

B000001DVD|5.0|The Second CD that was released. The sound was still a little 'Rough Around the Edges' (Not as Rugged as the sound on the CD \\"On Through the Night\\") but you can hear their sound starting to come together. Great Songs. For a True Def Leppard fan, This is a 'Must Have' CD. Long Live Leppards!!! :-X

B00516ZWRE|5.0|Saxons new cd Call to Arms harkens back to the good ole days of NWOBHM with the original formula for success. This is just some good heavy metal and Biff still has it in the vocal department. My hats off to him , same to Mark of Krokus both of these guys just get better and better with age like fine wine. I enjoy the other reviews on here. They hit it dead on and I cant add anything more to whats been said except if you havent heard Saxon in a while you definitely need to check out Call to Arms.    This cd has some great riffs, amazing solos, and pure power. The song Chasing The Bullet is allmost worth the price alone wow!
B000001F7R|5.0|The First of a Loonnngggg Career. This is My Favorite CD (Album!). Rugged sound, 'Sir' Richard very powerful!! :-D It sets the platform, a base, for a sound that will grow and grow from year to year, CD after CD.

B001AUKUS6|5.0|Invasion of Your Privacy, one hell of a album ! Full of great rock riffs, and searing lead guitar by DeMartini, Ratt laid down some serious rock. Steven Pearcy's voice was and is still unique in the world of rock making Ratt unmistakenly and  immeadiately recognizable.     I beleive that we have to give Ratt their due just for this album along. How can anyone not listen to the song Lay It Down without cranking that baby up and listening to that heart beat bass rythm. Thats one of the best bass lines in rock n roll period !!! This album certainly belongs in the top 20 albums of the 80s.     Invasion of Your Privacy is a 80s collectable for certain.
B000001DV2|5.0|This CD is the mark of the end of an era. Steve Clark died while recording this album (CD). Phil did a Fantastic Job filling in to finish songs that he and Clark were working on. He BECAME 'Steve Clark' for this album. That takes Talent!!!!! Great, Great Songs. A Heartfelt paragraph is inside the cover that gives you an insight of how the death of Steve affected and changed Joe, Phil, Richard (Sav) and Rick. Gotta have this CD!!!! Long Live Leppards!!! :-X
B0050SYS5A|1.0|I purchased this item because I have a small living room space and hoped it would improve my kinect experience, along with the mounting clip i purchased.  The zoom prevented the kinect from seeing the floor, even when it was elevated to nearly six feet or lowered to 2.5 feet.  Not sure if it's user error or a fail in the product, but I am very disappointed.  Can't use the item at all.
B0046ECFRM|3.0|Why I Read this Book: I first heard the buzz about this book about a year ago. Everyone was raving about it or they were anxious to get their hands on a copy to read it. So when it came up as a free Kindle read, I jumped all over it. Now, it has been sitting on my Kindle since last November. While I was anxious to read it (and see what all the fuss was about), at the same time I was afraid to read it because of all the hype the book has received. I was worried that it wouldn't live up to my high expectations and unfortunately that's exactly what happened.  What I Liked: Anna is likeable; she's relatable. She's thrown into this whirlwind adventure of being sent to a boarding school in a different country. And the best part of all - she's a film reviewer/blogger.  The secondary characters brought interest to the overall storyline. I found myself caring about them as much as I did the main characters. And the writing and storytelling flowed in such a way that made Anna and the French Kiss a good read.  I loved the declaration St. Clair made to his best friend at the end of the book. It gave me chills. Very sweet ending.  What I Didn't Like: I enjoyed reading Anna and the French Kiss but it didn't blow me away. It seemed as though everyone who has read this book loved it. They rave and gush over this book, over Anna, over St. Clair, and over their relationship. But I just thought it was okay. I didn't read any of the reviews on this book because I didn't want to have a tainted opinion going into it but I did have high expectations and I was expecting to be blown away. Sadly, I wasn't.  And there were parts of the storyline that were predictable, especially with what happened with Bridge, Anna's BFF from back home.  Overall Impression: I enjoyed reading Anna and the French Kiss but it just didn't WOW me.  It was a cute story about friends and relationships but it didn't live up to the hype in my case. I am still interested in reading Lola and the Boy Next Door.
B005NJ2K6U|4.0|If you'll pardon the pun, this game puts some twists into the match 3 genre with a puzzle format with switching, sliding, and flipping the shapes in addition to matching the jewels. It's a lot of fun.
0525423281|3.0|Why I Read this Book: I hadn't read Anna and the French Kiss before getting my hands on a copy of Lola and the Boy Next Door but I heard such great things about Anna's novel that I wanted to read both.  What I Liked: Lola and the Boy Next Door is the companion novel to Anna and the French Kiss. It was nice to see Anna and St. Clair make an appearance in this book. I did like Cricket more than I did St. Clair. Cricket knows what he wants and he wasn't afraid to express his feelings. St. Clair was in a `situation' that got in the way of his feelings for Anna.  Lola has quite a complex background but everything was explained so I never felt lost. I like the family structure.  I loved the scene where Lindsey, Lola's BFF, asks why the twins (Cricket and Calliope) aren't dressed up for Halloween. Calliope tells Lindsey that they are wearing costumes - they're dressed up as twins. Lindsey asks if they're fraternal or identical and Cricket replies \\"I have a penis.\\"  What I Didn't Like: I think the relationship between Lola and Max went on a little too long. I didn't feel the connection between them so I don't know why they stuck together for as long as they did.  Another thing I wasn't into was the drama surrounding Lola's mother. I don't think it helped the story by keeping the mom in the picture.  Overall Impression: While Contemporary YA is exactly my favorite genre to read (I'm more into riveting, life-changing YA reads or paranormal YA), I still enjoyed reading Lola and the Boy Next Door. I do need to be `in the mood' to read a book like this but it was a cute, sweet story and I look forward to reading Isla and the Happily Ever After when it comes out next year.

B005NGKLX2|4.0|\\"One day I woke up and found myself alone. Seemed like everyone I knew was dead or in jail, they thought I was dead too.\\" After writing for years to her son, James Blackthorn (Shepherd) hears about Etta's death. Wanting to see his home one last time he heads out. When he meets a young robber on the trail he forms a type of friendship. The young robber begins to realize that the old man is not who he says he is, he may be riding with Butch Cassidy. This is one of the best westerns to come out in the last few years (along with \\"Meek's Cutoff) and is that way for one reason. Sam Shepherd is fantastic in this role. Much like Sam Elliot, Shepherd is born to be in westerns. A mix of present day and flashback scenes make this movie riveting and you are questioning if he is really Butch or not. Weather you are a fan of westerns or not this is one movie that you should watch. Overall, one of, if not the best westerns to come out in the last 5 years. Great acting by Shepherd helps. I give it a B+.<br /><br />*Also try - Butch Cassidy & The Sundance Kid & Meek's Cutoff

B004EPYZXK|3.0|\\"Houston, this is Liberty. Did you see anything unusual in Westinghouse last night?\\" After the last \\"official\\" moon landing, Apollo 18 went up, but never came back. This is the story of that mission. Based on the preview for this movie I was not looking forward to this at all. A fake trip to the moon where they meet aliens...not my type of thing. After watching this I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this. I'm not saying this is an Oscar type movie, or that it can compare to Apollo 13 (because it is in no way close), but this in very enjoyable and entertaining. The whole thing is shot as a documentary the same way \\"Blair Witch\\" or \\"Cloverfield\\" was where you only see and hear what the main characters do. That adds a little something to the movie and in this case actually helps the movie. This is one of the better Horror/Sci-Fi movies I have seen and am still in shock at how much I was entertained by this. It also may have helped that I went in expecting garbage. Overall, a surprisingly good movie that is entertaining and tense at times. I give it a B.<br /><br />*Also try - Cloverfield & Evil Things
1451648537|4.0|[[ASIN:1451648537 Steve Jobs]]This is a very comprehensive book that details all aspects of Steve Jobs life and work bar one. Details about his formative years are sketchy. Walter Isaacson did not interview the one living person, adopted sister Patty Jobs, who could enlighten him more about interactions in the Jobs household that helped form Steve Jobs. Living relatives of Paul or Clara Jobs, his adoptive parents, were also not interviewed. Isaacson places more emphasis upon his biological parents. It seems that the literary works of Mona Simpson, Jobs biological sister, over influenced Isaacson. Even when there is a strong father figure in a home, mothers do help to form their children's personality. Clara Jobs gets no more than a few lines in a 600+ page book. Patty Jobs is mentioned only once or twice in passing. Research shows that she is still living and works at De Anza College in the payroll department, a position similar to that of her late mother. Hopefully a later biography will delve more thoroughly into Steve Jobs formative years.
B005KGPC4S|3.0|About the nicest thing I can say about this movie is that it was totally unpredictable. Three high schoolers venture into the woods, thinking they're going to \\"get some,\\" but they end up getting more than they bargained for. Religious fanatics tie them up and put them in cages.   I thought the beginning was very compelling, and I thought I knew where it was going, which had me wincing. But I was totally wrong. There is no real protagonist, and the story shifts focus about half-way through (which is sad, because I was much more interested in the goings-on inside the church) I was confused about one thing. The religious fanatics obviously had an issue with homosexuals... so why did they cage the 3 boys who were responding to an offer for heterosexual sex? Oh well. It was watchable and different from anything I've seen before, so if you want something different, give it a shot.
B0058WFO06|5.0|I can't get enough of this album.  Steven Wilson is a music machine.  With every listen, I discover new layers, new depth, and ongoing musical genius!
B000002H2H|5.0|Ride the Lightning is a lot better in my opinion but both are still great albums. RTL has the best of early thrash/speed metal but it also has some progressive influences that would show more on their next 2 releases. Ride the Lightning has the perfect mix and it's a classic. The band matured also from their previous both musically and lyrically, it's a but darker than their first album. It's also their first album to feature Cliff Burton on bass in every track, replaced Ron McGovney which he was the original bassist. Dave Mustaine was fired in 1983 and formed Megadeth, former Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammet replaced him and RTL is their first to feature him on guitar. The band gets their line up together here. All of the songs are great but Creeping Death is my personal favorite.
B00509ODFO|5.0|I don't know if Brad Wright or Robert C. Cooper knew the show wasn't going to be renewed, but this final episode of Season 2 is quite possibly the most fitting end to the show, let alone the season itself. Words can't describe how amazing the journey has been, the amazing sites we've seen, and the relationships we've created with the characters (and actors).<br /><br />While Sci-fi choose to pursue wrestling over science fiction, I have hopes that we'll see Season 3 at some point in the near future...<br /><br />EDIT: corrected grammar I overlooked when first posting.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|I had avoided Adele since she broke out in the US with \\"Chasing Pavements\\" - I didn't really like it, it was overplayed, and I did not get the Adele sensation sweeping everyone young and old, rich and poor, tall and short, male or female. I bought 21 because I liked \\"Rolling in the Deep\\", but never listened past the second song - \\"Rolling in the Deep\\" is the first song, I'm not a huge fan of the second song, and so I assumed the rest of the album wasn't my taste. I was wrong about that. The other night I decided to skip the first two songs and see what else was there to be heard. I didn't have to wait long. The third song, \\"Turning Tables\\", was the most emotionally affecting piece of \\"new\\" music (I know this album is like a year old now) that I've heard in probably at least a year. It makes me feel like my heart is exploding into light and rainbows and then being smashed into smithereens before I see it coming. I listened to it probably 25 times over the next 2 days. I continue to listen to it daily. I haven't explored the entire rest of the album yet, but have skimmed enough to know that I love \\"I Found A Boy\\" almost as much. The song is Adele's voice and no more than what sounds like an unaffected Fender Telecaster, playing a sort of Jeff Beck-style bluesy guitar piece paired with her old skool soul vocals. I will say that the production on both \\"Turning Tables\\" and \\"I Found A Boy\\" is superb... each song involves the exact instruments it should and not one that doesn't belong. The choice to feature the strings so prominently on the former and the sparseness of the latter take the songs from great to wonderful.  So far, I'm so stuck on those two I haven't listened to the rest of the album enough to give it a fair review, but I'll come back and add on later.

Superman was a decent movie but that was THIRTY something years ago. This movie was doomed by bad special effects (especially the costume), terrible dialogue , unbelievable actors, and too many cliche' cheesey moments that were almost embarrassing.<br />Come on DC, Marvel is beating the pants off of you at the theater, I just watched Captain America, now there's a super hero movie.<br />With the Avengers due next May DC better pull a Crisis in Infinite Theaters quick or they'll never get it right.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Let me preface this--I'd been hearing so much about this book, I felt like the last person to read it. But just in case...<br /><br />What IS The Hunger Games, you ask?<br /><br />Well, take Richard Connell's short story \\"The Most Dangerous Game,\\" mix it with Reality Television, throw in a tinge of romance, target it to the young adult audience, and out comes the first book in Suzanne Collins's post-apocalyptic trilogy.<br /><br />THG is set in a time where western civilization is gone, and all that's left is a Roman Empire-style nation called Panem with a main Capitol surrounded by 12 districts. (There were 13 until #13 was destroyed by the Capitol for rebellion.)<br /><br />Residents of the Capitol are very rich, well-fed and bored. So every year they hold a big, nationally televised, death match called \\"The Hunger Games.\\"<br /><br />The games are also used to reinforce the Capitol's power over the districts because each district is required to send two \\"tributes\\" to the games who must fight to the death--only one tribute out of all 24 is allowed to win (i.e., live).<br /><br />Tributes are chosen via lottery where all the kids aged 12-18 have their names put in a drawing. Your chance of getting picked increases each year because the number of times your name is entered doubles every year.<br /><br />And if you're poor, your chances of getting picked are even further increased because you can trade putting your name in the hat an additional time for food.<br /><br />That brings us to the main character, 16 year-old Katniss Everdeen and her little family.<br /><br />Katniss lost her father in a mine explosion when she was eleven, and she's been the sole supporter of her mom and her little sister Primrose (\\"Prim\\") ever since. She's a hunter and she's smart, but she's also had to trade her name for food more than once, so the odds are against her.<br /><br />Katniss has a hunting partner Gale, another impoverished fellow, who she's been hunting with since she was about 12. The two make a great team, and Collins hints at a romance between them. But they're very focused on their mission: finding food and taking care of their families. (Gale has three little brothers and no dad also.)<br /><br />So here comes the lottery, and since she's 12, it's also Prim's first year to be in the draw. I won't spoil the drama for you, but ultimately Katniss is the female tribute for District 12. The male tribute is a baker's son named Peeta.<br /><br />Peeta and Katniss have a history because after Katniss's father died, she almost starved to death until Peeta took a beating to give her two loaves of bread. They haven't really spoken since then--Peeta's from the privileged class--but neither of them have forgotten it.<br /><br />Now's the part where I get honest.<br /><br />All that takes place in the first chapter and a half. The next several chapters are focused on traveling to the Capitol, describing the Capitol, describing the food they eat, the clothes they wear, the interviews, the training... mer mer mer...<br /><br />Then the games start and the first chapter of that part is spent on Katniss with no weapons, hiding and nearly dying of dehydration.<br /><br />Now I know all that's \\"tension building,\\" and I also know I'm risking having tomatoes thrown at me by saying this, but at that point in the book I was BORED.<br /><br />I lamented to a friend that I was starting to think I was the only nerd who didn't *get* The Hunger Games fever. Seriously. I was like \\"When is something going to HAPPEN?\\"<br /><br />And right then it did.<br /><br />AND I've got to hand it to Collins. There's this Big Event during the games that's orchestrated by the Capitol because any time the games get \\"boring\\" the Gamemakers step in and make something happen.<br /><br />Ouch! Did you see what she just did there? She made Me, the Reader, identify with the barbaric Capitol. My hat's off to her. Nicely done.<br /><br />So back to the story, from there to the end, the book literally soars. That's how I lost a Saturday afternoon. You can't put it down.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, it's a tough read at times. Tears were on my cheeks more than once. Katniss is an excellent MC. She's a survivor and she's tough, but she's also relatable. And more than once she's put in the position of having to choose whether to protect or kill another tribute.<br /><br />Her relationship with Peeta is also difficult.

But this is a death match, and she's determined to get back to her family.<br /><br />The story is so well-executed and Collins covers all the bases.

And more than once she's put in the position of having to choose whether to protect or kill another tribute.  Her relationship with Peeta is also difficult.

B003O86FMW|5.0|It's either the French or the Russian revolution (or both) that teaches the political lesson of \\"never let the poor get too poor.\\" That's the overall tone of Catching Fire. The poor districts have lost so much, they're just looking for someone to challenge the Capitol.<br /><br />That someone turned out to be main character Katniss Everdeen in her resolution of the Hunger Games that was the basis of the first book.<br /><br />Uprisings are breaking out and during their \\"victory tour,\\" Katniss and Peeta see how close the Capitol is to collapse. And Katiness finds out how much trouble she's in for causing it.<br /><br />I don't want to give away too much of the plot and spoil any of the excitement, so I'll just say I read the first 12 chapters in one sitting right after I got the book. It's that good.<br /><br />Collins does a great job pulling the reader into the desperation of the district residents via Katniss, and I liked how in this book Katniss wasn't always having to rescue Peeta.<br /><br />The post-traumatic stress both former tributes are struggling with is nicly portrayed and naturally Peeta's the only one Katniss can turn to for comfort, the only one who shares her nightmares.<br /><br />CF is another emotional story, and Collins has a lot of fun manipulating the reader through the whole Peeta-Katniss-Gale love triangle. That's the difference from THG--the relationships take center stage much more than the games.<br /><br />The mid-season Quarterly Quell (mini-games) in CF are even more treacherous with additional animals and physical elements for the tributes to face. But surprisingly, this book had far less graphic violence than THG.<br /><br />Again, I started to get bored when they returned to the Capitol for training and presentation of the tributes to the Gamemakers. But this time it was just one chapter and we were out of there and into the arena. And back to flying.<br /><br />CF is 100-percent bad-language and adult-situation free (Moms), and sensitive readers need be less wary of this installment.<br /><br />These would make great book club books because they lend themselves to lengthy discussion. Collins smoothly pulls in current trends and makes them dark and sinister in her post-apocalyptic world. I mean, this is a world where kids fight to the death for the amusement of the general population. It would be unbelieveable if there weren't historical precedent.itive readers need be less wary of this installment.<br /><br />These would make great book club books because they lend themselves to lengthy discussion.

0545259088|5.0|\\"Forever\\" gets back to Sam and Grace, but doesn't leave Cole and Isabelle which I love. Both romances are so different but still very real and I'm sure everyone can relate to each of them at least once or twice. I felt like it took several chapters for the story to actually take off but once it did, it soared. Great plot, such vivid details but I have a warning...it does leave several ends untied which I was very disapointed with. I understand WHY she did it but I kills me to not have a clean ending, I needed to know for sure.

B00511ONPG|5.0|A lot of reviews here provide excellent and in-depth evaluations of this book.  I won't send you on a journey to the Department of Redundancy Department with this review, but what I will say is I heartily approve of and agree with the main premise, which is essentially be nice....don't blather on about yourself, and be a good listener... advice I think applies to all aspects of life, but especially so online, where your words are basically all folks have to go by to get a feeling of who you are and how you think and whether you're someone they might be interested in following/knowing/liking/etc.  The world needs more civility and this book does a superb job of providing guidelines.

1451648537|5.0|Whatever Steve Job's political views, he strikes me as a Howard Roark type figure, who lives by his own mind, who doesn't compromise the vision that he has.  He is a strong advocate of private property rights, that man has the right to what he produces with his mind.  With others living off his inventions.  Lecturing Obama about his anti-business views that make it so difficult to build a factory in the United States, and people wonder why there is an issue with jobs?  I would have loved to see Obama's response to Jobs' lecture, but unfortunately the book doesn't provide it.<br /><br />The puzzle for me is the huge gap between how Jobs lived his own personal life and his politics.  Jobs didn't think he owed people jobs.  He hired the people who he thought was best.  People either helped him produce the best products or they were gone.  Jobs wanted to give consumers the absolutely best products that he could give them.  How does this fit in with his support of liberal politicians?  It is a mystery that I wish I understood.<br /><br />The book itself is a unique history, where the author was able to ask Jobs many hours of personal questions and had in-depth interviews with others.
0385534639|5.0|On a quietly rolling train I traveled through London, Dublin, Munich, Massachusetts and New York too. The title of the novel, THE NIGHT CIRCUS by ERIN MORGENSTERN describes when the circus begins to give out tickets and start the acts. Yes, only at night can the splendor of the black and white striped tents become real beauties. In each tent there are wonderful dreamy fantasies to ogle over and enjoy.<br /><br />\\"At midnight, the bonfire is ceremoniously lit, having spent the earlier part of the evening standing empty, appearing to be a simple sculpture of twisted iron. Twelve of the fire performers...enter with small platforms that they set up along the perimeter like numbers on a clock. At thirty seconds before midnight, they light the tips of their arrows with small dancing yellow flames....As the clock begins to chime near the gates, the first archer lets his arrow fly, soaring over the crowd and hitting the mark in a shower of sparks.\\"<br /><br />However, The Night Circus is uniquely different for another reason. It is a deadly competition between  Marco and Celia. Mixed with this very serious competition is the throb of eternal romance and true love. Will love win or war?<br /><br />\\"Celia wishes she could freeze time as she listens to the steady beat of Marco's heart against the ticking of the clock. To stay forever with this moment, curled in his arms, his hands softly stroking her back. To not have to leave.\\"<br /><br />I hated to leave the circus for a different reason. I enjoyed meeting the other passionate lovers of the circus. In order to recognize one another these special spectators wore red: a red hankie, a red rose or perhaps a red scarf. I chose to wear a fire engine red sequined belt.<br /><br />After one night of sleep, I still can clearly see Isobel, the Fortune Teller, flashing her cards. Tsukiko contorting her body with its wildly flashing tattoo and of course Fredrick Thiessen, the intelligent and gifted clockmaker. Whom will I not remember? I will remember all of these characters especially Bailey. I hope the best of success to Bailey. I truly think he made the right decision.<br /><br />One question still haunts me. Did I travel to a circus or did I travel only in my dreams? Since ERIN MORGENSTERN is especially wonderful at painting with words, I might never know the answer.<br /><br />\\"You think, as you walk away from Le Cirque des Reves and into the creeping dawn, that you felt more awake within the confines of the circus.

B005M92MJ6|5.0|This album is just amazing. I try not to give out 5 stars to easily, but this CD easily earns it. This album does take a slightly different direction than \\"V is for Vagina\\", which I actually was not that fond of. That album gave the impression of being somewhat repetitive. However, after just loving this CD I will give it another try.  If you come into this CD expecting a Tool CD, then you will be disappointed. Some other reviewer mentioned if you like A Perfect Circle, you might like this. I would agree with, but I would also say that this is not like APC in that there is certainly less guitars than APC. It is similar in that it has some ambient, sort of ethereal fell to it but that is where the similarities end. A lot of the songs here are pretty minimal. There are plenty of drums and synths/samplers. Some songs do have guitar, but the guitars are not required to successfully convey the mood that Keenan is going for here.  Songs that stand out to me are Telling Ghosts, Man Overboard, Toma, The Weaver,Conditions of my Parole, and Oceans. These would probably classify as some of the heavier songs. The other songs are also very good. And as usual, Keenan's vocal performance throughout the CD is great. Plus whoever the woman is that is singing back up also does a great job.  In short....Just buy it. Just leave your expectations at the door about what you think a Keenan album should sound like and appreciate it for what it is.
B005G4TJUC|3.0|Unlike many other reviewers I liked the plot of this movie.  I found it engaging and enjoyed the twists in the storyline.  The action scenes were awesome, though not comparable to the first film, I thought they looked great.  The scene with the building falling over was incredible.  I enjoyed that they continued to use recurring characters that are now very familiar.  It cracked me up that they were watching Star Trek and then Leonard Nemoy was the villain. So, I was fine with this film, no it wasn't the best out of the franchise, the first one is certainly my favorite, but this one wasn't as horrible as others are writing about. With one exception...<br />Rosie Huntington-Whiteley was like a dead flower in a bouquet; everything else is pretty, but you're distracted with that dead flower and wonder, why is it there!!! It is made very clear what her purpose was when the very first shot of her is of her rear.  She might as well have been a cardboard cutout carried around with her hair that is always combed, lipstick always fresh, high heals always on, and ahhh that white coat that never gets dirty even during a battle.  She was so pointless in this movie I could only laugh. Are we the audience supposed to take the relationship between her and Sam seriously?  Who are they trying to kid!! She was the annoying, ALWAYS present damsel in distress.  I really came to resent her as a distraction.  This movie would have been so much better without the blond bimbo who's only reason to be there was to wear low-cut, tight clothing.<br />On a side note, I'm noticing that all reviews for this film that are 3 stars or less are all negative.  I'll be waiting for my first negative remark:)
0385738773|2.0|Wait...what? That's it? It seems the end was a bit rushed and the ending in general needed some more thought. Like the last two books, I had a lot of questions at the end...BUT this is the end...so I don't exactly see how that comes to work out well. Pretty frustrating.

1401324517|5.0|What an amazing read! Very insightful into both Rafa the Best Tennis Player (of all time!) and Rafa the person. The narration keeps you completely engrossed right from the very first word till the last. The back and forth between the Wimbledon 2008 final and Rafa's personal life and / or training was neatly done. And the best part is being exposed to a lot of things that goes in Rafa's mind both on and off the court and the principles that he follows in life. A definite MUST READ!

I'm not at all happy with having to pay 1.89  for a preview ! So I would have been better off paying 2.00 per episode because I have seen 1 and 2 and yes the preview. bummed. I had to buy preview to episode 4 ! The advertisement led me to believe I would be paying for future episodes 5-7. I only saved .10 an episode, and had to pay 1.89 for a stupid preview just showing the begging of the first episode ugggg
B000H4QD1O|2.0|Good idea, poorly executed. And why Summer Glau, who plays the most interesting character, River,isn't given more to do is baffling. She had the same problem in Terminator, The Sarah Connor Chronicles. They sort of wrote her out.   Summer, I know work is tough to get, but you have more to offer than the half roles they are throwing your way. Get a better agent.
B0051T47NQ|5.0|I had no idea what this movie was going to be like. WOW I was surprized.

People need to watch this movie. You will enjoy the romp through the fields of Norway on your way to hunting TROLLS.
B0050SYS5A|3.0|I have read a ton of reviews on this, and I'm starting to think that the problem lies with each individual Kinect Unit. My Kinect is placed on the same shelf as my TV, so it's just below the screen (for those of you who wanted to know). The problem I was having was the same as most negative comments: the tracking was erratic or non-exsistant, the Kinect had trouble locating the floor a few times even though I wouldn't move it, etc. I even have extra lighting that is emitted from my entertainment center specifically for the Kinect. What I realized the issue was for all the problems was the infared sensor. The lens seemed to distort it enough to where the Kinect had a hard time distinguishing a person at all, much less keeping that persons movements. While in the tuner (when the picture is green) it was obvious how clear the infared was without the zoom and how \\"fuzzy\\" it was with the zoom. All in all, I really think that it has more to do with my Kinect having the problem not connecting well with the zoom than the zoom itself.  The only game I tested it on was Your Shape Fitness Evolved mainly because I use it every day and if I couldn't use the zoom with it, then I wasn't seeing a point in keeping it.   I won't say that I think it's a bad product, I just know that it wasn't going to work for me. I'd encourage anyone to try it since it seems to work flawlessly for some people. I would just caution that people be willing to accept that it may or may not work out for them and to plan accordingly.

1451648537|3.0|If you are not familiar with the story of Apple Corporation, or perhaps what happened to Steve Jobs after he came back to Apple, there is huge merit to this book.  It is a straight narrative that lays out the story of Apple as well as that of Steve Jobs.  The high level technical descriptions of product development is quite educational. However, it is a narrative that is quite wide yet very shallow.  The story of his rise and fall and rise at Apple, followed by his struggle with cancer, makes for interesting but not compelling reading.  The spotlight is trained on Steve Jobs, and almost everything else is left in shadow.<br /><br />There is often a lack of context and a lack of follow through.  Example: While Jobs is fighting his cancer, and making various references to the potential of death, there is no reference to his adoptive parents.  Isaacson mentions the adoptive mother passing,but not the father-whom I am certain have already passed away.  There were no references from Jobs comparing situations?  Example: Apple comes up with a new product, and Microsoft or another competitor either says it won't work or is amazed at how good it is...but nothing about how or did they attempt to combat it.  There are frequent references during Jobs cancer about his digestive problems, and what he needs to do, and how he would not do it...but what specifically did he do?  If I were an elementary school math teacher, I would say that the author has not \\"shown his work\\"...he tells you something has happened, but nothing about the follow through or results.<br /><br />The areas of inadequate background are significant.  There is a huge parade of original Macintosh guys who leave Apple, but get paraded out during Jobs II product introductions. More backstory on them would help better frame the Apple story.  There are numerous references to Jobs mercurial personality, but few really personal examples of individuals rebounding from a Jobs dressing down (although we are assured it did happen).  We are told that Jobs \\"Reality Distortion Field\\" could motivate people to do things they didn't think they could, or do faster than they thought they could...but nothing about how they did it.  I think there is a story about the human toll of working with Steve Jobs that should have been told.  Suddenly Apple is described as having factories in China-employing 700,000 people.  When did this happen?  Why was work being done in China?  Cost?  Craftsmanship?  Proximity to materials?  More depth is needed to flesh out these developments.<br /><br />The book is good, but not great.  I rank it beneath Isaacson's bios of Franklin and Einstein, and therein is perhaps the problem.  Isaacson's previous efforts have been about historical figures, not contemporary figures.  The lack of depth and texture I allude to above is not present in his earlier books-I must wonder if he made assumptions about what people knew since his subject is a contemporary person.  Get it, read it, but if you are a big Jobs/Apple fan keep an eye out for a more definitive treatment.old that Jobs \\"Reality Distortion Field\\" could motivate people to do things they didn't think they could, or do faster than they thought they could...but nothing about how they did it.

B004AYCWY4|5.0|Another fascinating and thoroughly convincing book from the pen of one of our generation's most eloquent, inspiring, rigorous, dedicated, and prolific defenders of rational thought.  Might one take issue with specific points Dawkins makes, or conjectures he sets forth?  Sure, that's what scientists -- and any committed rationalists -- should do, when issue taking is warranted and alternative, more convincing, hypotheses suggest themselves.  Dawkins would undoubtedly be the first to welcome serious scrutiny of his thinking.  Might one take issue with the whole, i.e., with all of Darwinian theory?  It goes without saying that one might, and (sadly, pathetically) many do.  But the challenge to creationists, anti-evolutionists, and design theorists is to provide a convincing alternative to that theory, and to explain how the overwhelming evidence for it -- yet to be contradicted by a single piece of counter-evidence -- could point to a different conclusion than the one modern science has reached.  Of course, they can't.  That is not to say that Darwinian theory is insuperable, only that no theory yet devised has superseded it.  Why?  Because the evidence overwhelmingly supports it.  Why do anti-Darwinians insist otherwise?  Because anti-Darwinians -- for the most part -- are not scientists in honest (and rigorous) pursuit of truths about nature.  If evolutionists are ideologues (and I'm not saying they are), they are ideologues with a toolkit (scientific inquiry) that anyone can -- and is encouraged to -- employ, and with an ever-mounting wealth of data to support their claims.  If anti-evolutionists are ideologues (and I'm saying that for the the most part that's all they are), they are ideologues with a bullhorn only, whose shrill discourse masks their total impoverishment of ideas and what any thinking person should clearly see is their lack of evidence to support them.  Once again, Dawkins does a masterful job of throwing down the gauntlet, not as ideologue (thoughhe can be acerbic at times; who can blame him?) but rather as scientist.  Let's see his detractors match him idea for idea, evidence for evidence.  Anyone?  Not likely...
0307472841|2.0|I have to agree with a lot of you.  I was expecting a lot more plot after reading the first few chapters, but then the story bogged down into a seemingly endless history lesson.  I found myself flipping pages just to escape it all.  Plus the ending is very predictable about half way into the book.  I hope the author can do a better job with his next book.
B005IY3CMQ|1.0|\\"The King of Limbs\\" may not be Radiohead's greatest release but it deserves a better fate than that of being released as a confused, totally dis-jointed, remix. TKOLRMX 1234567 is beyond disappointing. Quite frankly, it sucks and I defy true fans of \\"the world's best band\\" to defend it. The fact that one track, \\"Bloom\\", is offered up in so many variations serves to illustrate how desperate an effort it was to come up with enough material to market. Of course, non of the variations of \\"Bloom\\" compare to that of the original release. Some things are just better left as is. I am left wondering throughout the entire TKOLRMX recording \\"what's the point?\\" I assume true Radiohead freaks will buy it anyway. I love the band though too but totally regret this spend.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|Benchmark reviews from tech sites show this processor to be MUCH faster than the i5-2500K when it comes to 3D rendering (still or animation), creating or editing video, file compression, fractal generation, or anything requiring constant real number crunching.  To the point that it is arguably worth the extra money.  This is due to the CPU enabling hyperthreading, combined with having a larger memory cache.  For regular uses (web browsing, word processing or other office apps (including spreadsheets), watching video), and to be succinct, the 2600K is overkill.    For a price:performance ratio, the 2600K is hard to beat.  Especially if you do content creation.
B000EHSVQ4|4.0|Overall, the historical situation was quite accurate.  The characters were not totally in line with actual historical events and the relationships were not necessarily accurate but, then, we have become accustomed to a general tendency toward poetic license in most movies.  However the events did occur and were accurately presented and made into a very enjoyable adventure.
B005OKTPKC|5.0|A thoroughly enjoyable outing from the master of the legal thriller. Our hero, David Zinc, walks out of his high-pressure career in a huge, high-flying law firm; and walks into the firm of Finley & Figg, ambulance-chasers extraordinaire. Oscar, Wally and their secretary Rochelle (to say nothing of the dog) only just manage to keep their heads above water by pursuing injury cases and divorces, and their tactics are not the most ethical. David is a Harvard graduate and son of a judge but has never actually been inside a courtroom. This mismatched group suddenly finds itself handling a potentially massive lawsuit against a major pharmaceutical giant, being represented by David's former employers.<br /><br />This book is much more light-hearted than some of Grisham's other novels and has lots of humour. Wally dreams of making it rich with one massive settlement, Oscar dreams of being rich enough to divorce his wife, while David dreams of having enough energy left at the end of the working day to start a family with his lovely (and very understanding) wife, Helen.<br /><br />Well-written, as Grisham's novels always are, this time we get an insight into the distinctly unglamorous and uncertain life of the lower echelons of legal life and while it might not be much fun for the lawyers, it certainly is for us. Despite their flaws, all three of the lawyers are enjoyable characters that we warm to more and more as the book progresses. My only complaint is that Grisham's books are usually stand-alone, so we probably won't get to meet with them again. All the more reason to enjoy this outing. Highly recommended.
B00007LTIA|5.0|Yes' double album Tales From Topographic Oceans was first released in December 1973 in England and January 1974 for those of us \\"across the pond\\". I've always found it a bit fitting that this album was released in Winter as the overall sound has a nice bluish hue with Rick Wakeman's keyboards reflecting a rainbow full of colors. This would mark Alan White's first studio album with the band and Rick Wakeman's last for a couple of years. Each side has it's own song and this proved to be a bit much for some especially when you realize that the entire concept was based on a footnote in a book called Autobiography Of A Yogi (and no, not the kind of Yogi who's looking for a picnic basket).<br /><br />The first song/side is taken up by a song called The Revealing Science Of God which deals with truth and that knowledge of God is a search which is a perfect album opener. The song itself goes through many cool changes and has great lyrics. The second song/side is given to a song called The Remembering and about how knowledge has been developing since ancient times. The third song/side The Ancient dives into a past beyond remembering and lost ancient civilizations which begins with some cool electronic effects before hitting a folksy part. The final song/side Ritual deals with freedom and the ritual of life. I love Steve's Close To The Edge quote early in while both Chris and Alan do a massive job. The bonus cuts are studio run throughs of The Revealing Science Of God and The Ancient.<br /><br />As you can see, the topics are very...well, I guess \\"new age\\". Rick Wakeman thought the album was padded, mostly the work of Jon and Steve. He quit not long after although all the band members have found nice things to say about it, at least, in spots. Steve Howe claims that some of his best work is on here. As far as the lyrics, Jon has said that \\"he's still working it out\\". I may not \\"get\\" all of it but I know what I like and the music here is irresistible.

B005ER6STG|1.0|I'll start by saying this is an amazing (if horrific) film and I can't say enough good things about it.   But my review comes at the realization that this is not truly the full version of the film. Sure it may only be cut by 30+ seconds...but if you're going to release an unrated version of a film, there should be NO CUTS since it did not go through the ratings board. Incredibly disappointing that such a unique film is still censored in a country that touts FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND EXPRESSION.   Just cancelled my order (thank you to the other users who pointed out the cuts). I'll wait and hope that some day this masterpiece will be released in the version originally intended.
B005HV6Y5W|5.0|Terrence Malick's \\"The Tree Of Life\\" is an epic poem that evokes the fierce power of memory and experience. It dares to use life itself as a \\"plot\\" and connect the dots between the evolution of the cosmos and the evolution of ourselves as people. In our postmodern times of timid filmmaking or mass production of consumerist escapism, Malick's film asks big questions, takes risks with narrative and really challenges the viewer. It is a tapestry of powerful images and memorable performances.   The film takes us back to 1950s America, focusing on a family being raised by Brad Pitt and Jessica Chastain. We see them go through the cycles of birth, growth, pain, conflict and the joy and anguish of growing up and feeling the world knock louder and louder at the door. Malick uses a tragic event to provoke one of eternal questions: Why? In a brilliant move the narrative cuts to an epic montage of the creation of the cosmos, showing the apocalyptic birth pangs of the Earth and the Solar System, nature flourishes and creatures appear in sea and then land. This remarkable section, in its mixture of images, science and music deserves comparison with Kubrick's \\"2001: A Space Odyssey.\\" In one memorable scene Dinosaurs are used to express ideas about compassion that make you wonder if Malick has been reading Peter Kropotkin's \\"Mutual Aid\\" for inspiration. With unique focus Malick makes the connection between the vast landscape of creation with the smaller yet equally big and menacing landscape of a Texas family experiencing the cycles of life.   The scenes involving the family in Texas are written and filmed with a unique sense of evoking moods, experiences and people. Here the smallest details are polished to a gloss, there is no traditional movie \\"plot\\" because life itself is not a scripted affair, possibly only the broadstrokes of being born and learning to walk, and even then. With little dialogue Malick goes back to the roots of ourselves, the experience of being a baby, learning from our parents and their dialectics, feeling innocence being pushed away by the darker realities of the world. Brad Pitt and Chastain give excellent performances. Pitt fully creates a stern man who may seem brutal, but you realize this is the kind of iron discipline mixed with fatherly affection that creates someone like Malick himself (the film is party autobiographical), it is impressive to see how Pitt evokes the inner mechanisms of his character through facial expressions and physical mannerisms. Jessica Chastain here is revealed as an actress of unique grace, evoking a love tempered by life's hurtles. Some complain about the spiritual aspects of the film, but in a film exploring life, why can't it feature one of the eternal topics which mankind has embedded into the deepest core of its societies and cultures: God? And in a film that takes place in the 1950s, it is not out of step to show a family with deep religious roots, it is a basic part of the historic American experience.   Malick and his cinematographer, the Mexican maestro Emmanuel Lubezki (Children Of Men, The New World), produce images of wonderous poetry and hypnotic intensity, using natural light like a paint brush. The use of classical music gives the film a grand tone and a special rhythm. Film students in years to come might look at this film in wonder to study its editing technique, the way it is narrative without traditional narrative tricks.   \\"The Tree Of Life\\" shames many of today's films simply by doing something truly different. It might even throw off balance those who've admired Malick's earlier work such as \\"Days Of Heaven\\" and \\"The Thin Red Line\\" which featured his unique, poetic style but never pushed the envelope as far as this movie does. In a time when \\"daring\\" means \\"The Curious Case Of Benjamin Button,\\" Malick shows us that the cinema is full of endless possibilities where a director can try to achieve something special, something more profound. This is a beautiful, timelessfilm.

B00383UJ2U|5.0|HURTS continues to re-establish the New Wave, Synth-pop genre, and Happiness is definitely one of my favourite CDs within the category. Their collective taste and style is smooth, and each song within the compilation would bring the desire of listening one song to the next. Each song after \\"Wonderful life\\" is mesmerizing and definitely incorporates many influences of melancholy and elegance, with traces of smooth style. Overall: A-
B005PW3OS8|5.0|I really loved this movie. I saw it in theaters in 3D, and then again in 2D and it was good both ways. I was so excited when i saw that it was out on video on demand. Out of all of the recent Super Hero movies that have come out recently Captain America is my favorite.
0439023513|3.0|I'll skip the fluff and go straight to the point, Collins retains her natural ability of getting the reader to keep reading with few pauses before finishing, but struggles to end the magnificent series in a way that would give it justice.   All that is on the outside (the war, Panem, government) is resolved with great closure and is put away nicely within the last few chapters with a few twists and turns that Collins loves to throw at the reader. It's what's on the inside that is left untouched. Katniss, despite multiple conversations within the book itself exclaiming that this isn't true, undergoes absolutely no change whatsoever between the end of the first book and the end of the series.   The original Hunger Games was written with such mastery and while I undoubtedly enjoyed the other two books, I knew something was missing. Something didn't quite stick with the last two that stuck with the first. I now know what that is, and it is very cleverly disguised within such great character development from supporting characters. It was the change that Katniss did not undergo. In the beginning of the very first book, Katniss was presented to the reader as an unimportant peasant in the mistreated District 12, at the end, she is a nationwide phenomenon. At the beginning of Catching Fire, she is a symbol of rebellion, at the end of Mockingjay, this public view doesn't change. And while this outside view does not dictate how Katniss develops internally, it does have an impact, and that I believe is what Collins failed to realize.   One last bone to pick with this, the ending seemed a bit hurried for the massive turn of events that happened. She does an \\"inexplicable act\\" as we'll call it to avoid spoilers, and then 2 pages later all is forgotten and an \\"oh well, we'll let you slide for the 1000th time\\" mood is established. After another 2 page flip, the end.   Collins did succeed on some levels though. I think the way she handled Peeta, Finnick, and Annie throughout the novel is worth a ton of praise. Finnick went through an absolute metamorphosis in this book. Peeta went to hell and back in such detail, and Annie is so symbolic of everything Finnick loved in his life. Well done on that front. The best part of the final novel however is how the deaths of characters are presented. With the exception of one (and the most important, again, trying to avoid spoilers), all the deaths are presented in a way where you feel sorry for all of those that die, no matter how unimportant they were. The details of their final moments are portrayed in such a haunting way that it really sticks with you each time someone passes.  Overall, I'd put this one last in the series, but that's not to say it is bad. The ending could have had some work, and Katniss' character left some holes in the reader's head, but it is definitely worth a read for those who enjoyed the first or second book in the series. Collins ended the series right when she should have, when it was losing steam. The first book deserves a full 5*, while the second deserves 4*, and now the third deserves 3*.
B003YVCJQ0|5.0|This is one of my absolute favorite movies.  I wish i could purchase it so i can stream it whenever i want instead of having to rent it.  Must say, though, the rental rate is definitely reasonable.

0062060554|5.0|Great book!!! I hesitated getting this to read because of some of the reviews, but it caught and held my attention all the way through. This is one of those rare finds that you can't stop reading  because you can't wait to find out what is going to happen in the end.  Loved it!!!
0385342039|5.0|What can I say? This book is a keeper.<br /><br />Sophie Kinsella has done it again. All of her books are so funny. They make me laugh out loud, which I really shouldn't do because I am usually in class while I am reading. And everyone looks at me funny and they all probably think I am weird or something to be laughing during the professors lecture. But hey everyone should laugh on this one.<br /><br />It is a quirky tale of the ups and downs, twists and turns of keeping up with a real live ghost.<br /><br />I really hope that you enjoy this review it is my first one. I am sure they will get better as I go along.
B001UV4XIS|5.0|I love the whole Harry Potter series, this last movie was amazing!! I can't wait to buy this DVD, but why can't they put special features on it? There are some people that don't want to buy blu-ray and I am fine with DVDs. It ticks me off though that there isn't any special features on the DVD! They need to fix this. Hopefully they'll release the ultimate edition with special features soon.

B005IS565S|5.0|FFDP is one of the very few heavy-metal bands still around, that are HEAVY and GOOD. This album does not disappoint. Their music is heavy enough to keep most headbangers happy, whill good enough to make its way on may rock radio stations.  Just a great band, making their 3rd great album.

B002MQYOFW|3.0|I read many pre-teen/teen books as I run several book clubs and reading groups.<br />I can honestly not recommend this series!<br />Okay, the kids love it, but they are also reading \\"Twilight\\"...ick.<br />It is a poorly-written story of a post-apocalyptic America with that Shirley Jackson's \\"The Lottery\\" plot of a long-time game to the death theme.<br />I would have liked to enjoy the book as, eventually, I cared about the characters.  But I simply couldn't get past the schmaltz.
B005D0TETA|5.0|Like many of us Yes fans, I bought this on DVD not long after it came out.  I thought the Magnification album was quite good, and a friend of mine attended the filming of this so I had to have it.  After viewing it for the first time I realized that this is one of their best concert releases to date.    Is this Blu-ray worth the double dip?  It definitely is IMO.  The audio mix sounds like the same one from the DVD, but it has a clearer, fuller sound to it.  It has an uncompressed DTS Master Audio 5.1 soundtrack at 48khz/24bit.  There is also a PCM stereo track but I can't comment on it because I've only heard the 5.1 mix.  The video is 1080i but it looks very good regardless.  I have already shown this to a couple fellow Yes fans and they were blown away.  Highly recommended for any live concert fan.

0316098329|2.0|This book was disappointing for a best seller. The opinions inside the cover were of no help in my choosing this book.  It is written from the point of view of a 5 year old child (the entire book). I kept waiting for an improvement but nothing arrived.  Other than to be aware of ones surroundings, so as not to be a victim, I learned nothing from this book. I threw it in the waste basket after reading it.  An unfortunate waste of money.
B00278U1W0|5.0|O blu-ray está com uma qualidade de gravação muito boa. O show é bem legal e o público demostra ativamente que o show realmente é bom. Para variar Eric Clapton dá uma aula na guitarra. Vale a pena a aquisição!

1451648537|3.0|I saw the special on 60 Minutes touting this book.  I went right out and bought it.  I've never been a Steve Jobs fan (I'm a PC person) but I was interested to read about him, since he was touted by the world as an innovator. The books is enlightening in that it doesn't gloss over Steve Job's life. As a matter of fact, it's just the opposite.  It seems no one had a nice thing to say about him.  I'm half way through the book and I'm about ready to put it aside.  So far the book is instance after instance after instance of Steve Jobs essentially being abusive to people, and worse that the people put up with it.  His personal quirks are interesting to read about at first,  but a whole book full of how skewed he saw the world and how abusive he was, starts to wear thin fast. It makes me glad I was never a fan of the man in the first place.

Plate to Pixel...great book! Beautiful delicious pics, too.
0439023513|4.0|I'm not sure that the people reviewing this trilogy realize it was written for young adults (that's where I found them in my library).  I loved the stories and enjoyed discussing them with my 13 year old granddaughter. What in heaven's name are these people looking for? The annihilation of a world? A seventeen year old girl to have all the answers? The relationships in these books pertain to teenagers for the most part, what they've dealt with and how their capabilities are limited by their young age. Trying to make an epic out of a fantasy work is just nonsense. Accept it for what it is and just enjoy it! My granddaughter, my daughter and myself certainly did!
B000059HB7|5.0|This is one of my all time favorite films. Both the Duke and Dino were never better. Much of the story in this film was repeated a couple of times later, both times by John Wayne and Howard Hawks, but this is the original and the best. The setting, casting, and acting are great. This movie is almost as good as The Searchers.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This movie is very... very cold. But that's a good thing. Christian Bale gives an amazing performance. Other reviews slam this movie. It does not really have references to the Matrix. The only true similarity is the clothing that Christian Bale and the other \\"clerics\\" wear in the film.  This is also the movie with the highest number of kills by a main character. By some accounts its 114, by others its 96... its still the most.
B004HO6I4M|5.0|My children really enjoyed the music and the colours of the movie. My husband and I watch a lot of kids movies, and this one is easy to repeat. The kids are fascinated with the dancing and often join in. This movie also was a starting point for our family talking about difficult issues like poaching, strangers, dangerous situations , being lost, etc....  All in all we LOVED this movie. !!!!!!!!!!
B005DF2QMC|5.0|I've only had this little cassette capture device for a few days, and I've already convertered the several cassettes that were most important to me.  These include some science fiction \\"books-on-tape,\\" and some classical music.  Now I have it all on my iPod Touch.  As others have stated (above), this device is not made of highly durable and rugged materials.  It probably wouldn't last with any rough treatment.  But, with care, it will get the job done, for a very reasonable price.  Using my usual style, I fumbled through all the steps.  Made some mistakes.  But, with some trial and error, it didn't take very long.  Actually, the hardest (most time consuming)part is the waiting around while the tapes play to the computer.  I give it a five star because it did everything I needed done.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is so talented. Each one of her songs are amazing; I'm so glad she is now on the radio.
B0055G0BGW|5.0|I admit to having a problem with most Italian opera seria.  I am probably more partial to the French school of tragedie lyrique, favoring the operas of Rameau, Lully, Charpentier to those of Vivaldi and Handel.  I think this is due in large part to the predictability in form of opera seria, where da capo arias and recitatives strictly alternate with hardly any choruses or ensemble pieces interspersed.  When recorded it can make for a rather monotonous experience, whereas the tragedie lyrique flows more freely and more humanly.  The present recording of Handel's first successful opera seria, however, is enchanting and lively.  This is Handel's last opera for his stay in Italy and represents a tale of treachery in imperial Rome toward the end of the Julio-Claudian dynasty.  Agrippina, wife of emperor Claudius, uses her cunning to install her son Nero on the throne at all costs.  This opera is cast in the form of opera seria generally, but diverges at times, leaving room for short ensembles and ariettes that do not stifle the drama.  For Rene Jacobs this presents treasure trove of interpretive possibility.  This recording is not flat, monotonous Italian opera seria.  Rather, Jacobs utilizes the full range of dynamics of the period instruments of Akademie fuer Alte Musik Berlin to stunning results.  It is a recording of serious opera that you don't find yourself skimming over the recitatives and da capo repetitions in arias.  Jacobs keeps the drama flowing even during recitatives, allowing (historically correct) dramatic license for the continuo section as they not only accompany the singers, but comment on the action as well using improvised tone painting.  In arias, there is no simple repetition in da capo arias, rather the singers display virtuosic and tasteful improvising when appropriate, as the famous singers of the baroque were documented as having done to thrilling results.  Alexandrina Pendatchanska is the prima donna.  I first heard of her on another Jacob's recording in the role of Vitellia in Mozart's opera seria La Clemenza di Tito.  This powerful singer has subsequently sung the roles of emotionally conflicted women (Donna Elvira) or conniving villainesses (Elettra and Vitellia).  Agrippina fits in the latter category, and in this role Ms Pendatchanska is perfectly in her element.    Sunhae Im is Poppea, consort to the future emperors Nero and Otho.  If Ms Pendatchanska is the prima donna, Ms Im is a close second.  Having previously taken on lighter roles under Jacobs's baton (Papagena, Zerlina) she is dazzling in the present recording, displaying firework coloratura that I was not expecting from this singer who I had already thought was wonderful.  Marcos Fink plays the aged emperor Claudius.  I had not previously heard a bass get more into the character more credibly.  For example, the arioso \\"Vieni, o cara\\" in Act 1 in which he attempts to force himself of the much-younger Poppea, Mr Fink paints Claudius as the 'senex amans' in such a believable way that it is almost comic.    As for the rest of the cast, there is hardly a weak link.  Mr Jacobs previously expressed his belief that attention should be paid to recitatives as well as arias, as they are the primary tool by which opera seria conveys plot.  He has urged his singers to act using just the voice when recording, and his Agrippina is perhaps the best example of this practice when applied to Handel's operas.  This is human sounding opera seria, hugely dramatic, and for a serious topic of murder and politics, it is, at last, a recording that coneys this topic with justice.  Displays of virtuosity abound by so many of the singers and obligatto members of the orchestra, it is difficult for me to pinpoint standout tracks.  This is one recording of opera seria that I can recommend without hesitation.

1600597963|5.0|When I first saw that this book came out, I passed it by, thinking that I didn't need it since I already have a small collection of bead embroidery books, including [[ASIN:160059672X Sherry Serafini's Sensational Bead Embroidery: 25 Inspiring Jewelry Projects (Beadweaving Master Class Series)]], [[ASIN:0871162431 The Art of Bead Embroidery]], and [[ASIN:1596680040 Beading on Fabric: Encyclopedia of Bead Stitch Techniques]].  At a beading class last weekend taught by Jill Wiseman (whom I see has also already reviewed this book), however, Jill said that is was a fantastic book that was worth picking up -- so, of course, I had to immediately order it to add to my beading library. It's definitely worth it!  If I could give this book six stars, I would -- it's that amazing.<br /><br />As other reviewers have remarked, what is noteworthy about this book is that instead of just including a short chapter at the beginning that covers techniques, this book spends the first 88 pages going over various techniques in detail.  Although I didn't pay attention to it at first, the subtitle of this book is _A Reference Guide to Techniques_, and that is most certainly what this is.  The in-depth coverage is fantastic, and I learned some new skills that I can immediately put to use.<br /><br />For instance, I was taught to bezel cabochons onto the backing by using peyote or perhaps netting, depending on the size of the cab.  In Cloud Eakin's book, she gives several new techniques to use that I have never seen before, including what she calls Stacks Bezels and Outside Window Bezel that add a whole different level of \\"pop\\" to a piece.<br /><br />After the techniques and skills are explained, Cloud Eakin includes nine projects with detailed diagrams and instructions. The projects include a purse, several earrings, and several necklaces.  While nine projects might not seem like a lot, scattered throughout the entire book are probably at least a hundred beautiful photos of finished pieces for inspiration, and, as bead embroiderers know, creativity is key with embroidery since this medium lends itself to customized pieces.  As each technique is discussed, there are also several color photos of sample pieces that use the technique; this in invaluable for seeing the technique in action, so to speak. The photos for the nine projects also contain several samples in various colorways so you can see the possibilities.<br /><br />Another thing I have never seen before in a beading book is that at the very end of the book, there are six pages of \\"Photo Descriptions.\\"  Basically, in this section there is a list of the kinds of beads and techniques used in  each and every photo in the book.  I can only imagine how much time it must have taken to put this compendium together, but it's a fantastic way to gather ideas about how to apply the techniques to the creation of your own designs.<br /><br />There is plenty of eye candy in this book, and I'm so very happy that I picked it up!

The book detailed the progression of a woman with early onset  Alzeimers.  Alzeimers is a difficult disease to confront; however, after reading this, I realize that my aged mother just has dementia which is easier to deal with.  My book group was glad they had read it even though the subject is difficult to face because it is so well written and researched.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I bought this headset because I've always loved Logitech products (their mice and keyboards are amazing) but sadly this was little more than a waste of time and money.  The audio was heavily warped/distorted and upon searching I found no shortage of other people who had experienced this problem.  Many were able to resolve it and I tried every method I could find that others had found successful (including shelling out even more money for a powered USB adapter) but none of them worked.  I tried it on both of my computers (a Dell desktop and an Alienware laptop) and in different OS's (both are dual-boot Ubuntu/Win7).  In any event one should not need to devote hours to get a headset working.<br /><br />I will continue to buy Logitech's mice and keyboards but never again will I waste my time on any of their audio products.
6305428042|5.0|This is a seasonal favorite.  I try to watch it every Halloween season.  It's hard to find a Halloween movie that is fun like this one with just a hint of old school scariness.  Wish there were more like it.  Oddly, I usually watch \\"To Kill a Mockingbird\\" at this time of the year too.  Definitely nothing in common with this movie, but still, takes place and references the traditions of Halloween without the gore and disturbing trash that passes for entertainment in some of the horror flicks out there.  Highly recommend this for all ages.

0385344325|2.0|Long awaited, but disappointed in story. Yes it fills some gaps, but it was not up to Lee Child's best products.   I thought the story line was redundant, and unnecessarily explicit in fill-up-the-pages sexual content. Reacher's character is that of a good man, with healthy appetites, exceptional instincts and fun side trips. I love these stories because Reacher just gets the job done with the bad guys, in twisting turning plots.    This just didn't match up with the quality of the rest of Child's novels.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|The application installed just fine on my phone, but it crashes immediately upon opening on the XOOM.  The Android Market says it is compatible with the XOOM.  What gives?<br /><br />The application is fantastic on my phone...just want it to work on my tablet.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I just rebooted the tablet and now the app works fine.  A little scary - now Android is behaving like Windows!  All is well...
B003L77GRO|5.0|After 5 seasons, Dexter is still going strong as ever and the characters are growing even more complex.  This season was a treat to watch as Dexter's relationships evolved with his coworkers and family.  This season contains a lot of tense moments that will keep you on the edge of your seat.  It will be very interesting to see the effects of season 5 on the upcoming season.  Highly recommended.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was definetly my favorite book ever. The dystopian theme that seems to be so popualr in young adult books now was horrifying and facinating at the same time. It gives readers a look on poverty and hunger. I laughed at the frivolous capitol people and cried during the blood-curling scenes of the Hunger Games. I love the love triangle between Katniss, Peeta and Gale. I love the passion and strenght that Katniss has and the bond between her and Peeta, because they where in the Games together and survived. Just one question. Was anyone on team Gale??
B004Q3UK02|4.0|I've hit a few little snags with the connection, but that's only happened once or twice. Great audio and video quality. I am completely hooked on this show, and love that I could get the episodes on here for way cheaper than buying the dvd's in the store.
B00122Z7NK|5.0|This album was the first Electronica I heard. ever. I had been raised in the really classical-loving family, and just never got into any of this. well. too late, for now I make my own Electro. this album is great. it's really dark, beat heavy, bass heavy, and just so much fun to listen to. my least favorite track is newjack. just doesn't do it for me. but pretty much all the other ones are amazing. I love the way Genesis floods into Let There Be Light. and I really love Valentine. Definitely worth the money. it's a unique and beautiful piece of music, and one for the history books.

1451648537|3.0|The subject is fascinating, the timing perfect, but the book unfortunately is far from good enough.  I feel that Steve would never approve it.  It looks as if it was finished on the hurry to surf on Steve's death, it is not well written, it is a collection of short stories almost randomly put together, with unexplainable repeating of the exact same informations and a lack of good chronology and a real development of Steve's character.<br /><br />Very little is added from what was already known about Steve's history, even though the author has interviewed more than 150 people.  Not only those interviews don't add much to what was already widely known and reported by the press, but, what is worse, the author didn't manage to, as it is excepted from a high quality biography, deeply engage with the subject and really portray his personality with more than one inch of depth.<br /><br />Maybe Steve was a really hard subject and this was his fault, but, nevertheless, the book remains disappointing to the readers that already know Apple's history and have already read other press articles about it and/or Steve.  Though the book covers all his history, neither his personality, nor his products and other feats are portrayed in a deep fashion.  I feel disappointed.<br /><br />(I read the whole book in the Kindle Edition)
B004GJYR7I|5.0|Terrific funny movie which shows the comedic skills of a young Katherine Hepburn and Cary Grant.  Fun for the whole family!
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|The fifth star is for staying true to the story. By making a mini-series rather than a 2hr movie this version has the time to recreate more of the original book than any other version. Excellent actors in a well made production.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I did not have time to read the book so I listened to the audio tapes. What incredible performances by the four, very distinct actresses who narrated this book. I LOVED IT--even saw the movie and felt that it was an accurate representation of the book for the most part. However, there's one quibble: the publisher does not order the CDs digitally so when you download them onto a smart device, they are all out of order and the tracks do not have the same names or sequential numbering. What a weird oversight and backward of them!
B001I45UFC|5.0|You know, I can't help but question whether a book like this would be published today. There's a lot of telling, not so much showing, a lot of action is skimmed over and it's very obviously a religious allegory (not that that would make it ineligible for publication). I couldn't help but think that as I read it but at the same time I couldn't help but think just how magical the story actually is.  Compare the circumstances to other works now and you don't have all that much that is original but then, back in 1950, this was the epitome of original. There was nothing else like this story except for facetious fairy tales that carried very little depth. This was the basis for portals and other worlds and magical creatures that authors today either consciously or subconsciously pull from for their own stories. So no, it's not original today but it is the very reason it's not original today, because it was so original and magical then that it was bound to spurn derivatives.  This is a classic fairy tale despite the obvious Jesus references (if I could find that YouTube video, I'll post it, with Aslan as Jesus). It's light and airy and the kind that, obviously without me saying it, will stand the test of time for many more years to come. The children are eternally relatable , their wishes are forever there in the reader, to escape to a magic land and become king or queen. There's nothing in there that couldn't appeal to anyone, at any time, reading it.  When comparing this book to something like Stardust by Neil Gaiman, I think the voice of Narnia just stands out. This was Lewis's voice. He was born to write these types of fantastical stories in the style of an age-old fairy tale. While Gaiman's idea for Stardust was on the level of awesome, the voice just wasn't right. There was a sort of force there, a trying too hard. I use Gaiman as an example because (aside from the fact that I can't think of any other authors that have tried to write like this) he's a magnificent writer and writes amazing stories. Stardust was an experiment for him, not his usual voice so it's not chalked up to him not being able to write. That old timey style voice of fairy story telling is bestowed only on a select few. Lewis was one of those few.  These stories are capable of transcending time with ease and are written in such a way that they'll never go out of style. Sure, you'd have to be either really damn good or someone of Gaiman's status in the publishing industry to get something like this published now, and even then there's no guarantee of equivalence, but it doesn't erase the fact that Narnia was published, does exist and will continue to exist for generations. There is a classicism about these stories that just can't be erased and just can't be mimicked unless you've been bestowed with the voice to do it.  Yes, there is so much that could be expanded on in Narnia but what's already there on the pages is amazing. Perhaps it is because it's the epitome of a fairy tale and someone who's much more critical than I can might be able to see how empty of a plate it might be but to me, there's just enough there to trust the reader. It's not bogged down in worldbuilding infodumping or unimportant backstory or research masturbation on the part of the author. All that's there is what's important to the story at hand, and nothing else. It goes from point to point seamlessly and with little to no fat and, for me anyway, makes the experience of the read that much more enjoyable.  The world misses fairy tales like this, in all their simplicity but I don't think there can be much more than what there is now without an inundation which would only devalue what's already available. Let's hope the world never has to know what it's like to live without Narnia.

B0057R5XRG|5.0|It's true, there are quite a few scenes in the original movie that appear grainy. But, to say that the transfer is \\"just horrible,\\" as some have put it, or to say that \\"the DVD has better quality\\" is just ridiculous. I still own the original DVD release of each film, and also the trilogy set that was released a few years ago. Upon watching the Blu-ray editions, I could immediately tell the difference in the quality. But, just for kicks, I decided to test these statements that reviewers have been making, and pop in each DVD edition to compare the quality to the Blu-ray... there is no contest.  Just to throw my fellow reviewers a bone here, maybe it is the type of Blu-ray player these films are being viewed on, or possibly the HDMI connection cable, or resolution of the TV. But for me, my PS3 with Monster HDMI connection on my Samsung 1080P LCD, the films look great. The transfer on The Lost World: Jurassic Park is damn near perfect, Jurassic Park III comes in second, and Jurassic Park comes in third. Sure, the quality may not be absolutely perfect, but the Blu-ray edition also includes some pretty nice featurettes and interviews, which the low star reviewers had not mentioned. These reviews are for the product as a whole, not just video quality.   I can understand that $50 seems a bit pricey, but comparatively, Blu-ray discs usually retail for $20 or more, so to me, it doesn't seem like that bad of a deal. Everyone is, of course, entitled to their own opinions, so if the transfer is just too much for you to handle, then stick with the DVD or even VHS editions.  In my opinion, strictly on film quality:  Jurassic Park - 7/10 (during certain scenes), 8.5/10 most of the film  The Lost World: Jurassic Park - 10/10  Jurassic Park III - 9/10  Featurettes on all three films - 10/10 quality and 10/10 content  I do agree with other reviewers complaining of the fact that Amazon mixes their reviews, very annoying...
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|A much welcomed escape.  Went to see it at the movies twice and will buy a copy for my DVD library.  Romantic, great story, excellent characters and depictions of the late-greats are tops.  I'll refrain from fawning over this movie too much as I don't want to spoil it for the others.  It's magical.  What can I say but go see it and that we need more movies like this.  Refreshing break from melting buildings, crumbling sidewalks, 50 car pileups, crude, rude humor and stacks of shot up bad guys.  A breath of fresh air.

1250004217|5.0|This was one of the best books I have read lately.  I loved the way the book read from Sarah's life back to Julia's life in the first half of the book.  It was so interesting to read how life changed for Sarah; but so devastating as well.  Julia had a sad life in some respects as did Sarah, but Julia at the same time made some really good choices which made for an interesting ending.  Just buy and read.  You will not be disappointed.  It is a sad book, but some of the book is true which means that we should not forget how the war affected the jews in such a horrible manner.  It was totally unforgettable as well as unforgivable.  This is truly a classic.  Just read, and enjoy..............

0062011847|2.0|It may seem a ridiculous suggestion, and one makes it only after much reluctant consideration, but I have to question whether Terry Pratchett actually wrote this book at all. The style is so different to earlier novels, and the sentence construction so amateurish, that it's possible to imagine that the work was done by someone far less talented. If you examine an early novel (I picked Small Gods off the shelf, an absolute favourite) you find a variety of sentence length. Some sentences are very short indeed, while even the long ones are straightforward and elegantly constructed. When conversations occur, they are in naturalistic small bursts, the conversation moving quickly from one character to another. The net result is prose that can be read almost without effort, that slips into your brain as naturally as your own thought.  In Snuff, however, sentence length is generally over-long. Within each sentence there are frequently several subjects and several verbs: for example \\"And if said citizen was found dead then said policeman, who had been seen to have a scrap with him earlier, might just be considered to be a tiny bit guilty when all was said and done, and while all was being said and done, someone really intent on getting Vimes into difficulties would have left the corpse of the blacksmith there, wouldn't they?\\" We've moved with appalling rapidity from the citizen to the policeman to \\"all\\" to \\"someone\\", each with appropriate verbs and surrounding verbiage. Hard to read, clunky in operation and not what we expect from someone who has always been a superbly professional, highly competent wordsmith.  Terry Pratchett has brought untold delight to generations of readers. I still remember 25 years ago, while driving a neighbour's children to school, the hysterical giggling that came from the back seat as a 13 year old boy first encountered Discworld and the Unseen University. Despite being a whole generation older, the driver knew exactly what he was laughing about.It hurts to see a hero brought low. Perhaps, Terry, you should quit while you're ahead?
0756405890|3.0|...All you cats out there tryna be English professors.  ...All you cats w/ the Mary Sue bit  ...Everyone that says this book is so moving (blah blah blah)  The TRUTH is...  Rothfuss is a GREAT WRITER - he just spends Waaaaay too much time on idle conversations.  This is a GOOD STORY(If youre not into action)  (Despite what some reviewers have written, there is NO SWORD PLAY nor ANY kind of ADRENALINE RUSH)  Its a 700+ page book that is DEFINITELY OVERWRITTEN  Scene decriptions are ENDLESSLY REPETITIVE - we get it - Kvothe is Broke.  Noone cares about the love interest - she shows up waaaaaaay too much & makes ZERO IMPACT.  Most of the time is spent WAITING for the main character to actually DO something.  GOOD CONCEPTS - Rothfuss' story is original, but SLOW PACED.  Everytime you think the story will pick up - he slows it to a crawl.  3 Stars: Not as Good as Abercrombie not nearly as LAME as Gaiman.

B0041KKYBK|5.0|It seems just about every person in America has been affected in at least some way by the recent economic downturn (can we say 'depression'?).  Many Americans (myself included) had (or have) a general understanding of the reason for this.  The housing bubble, the collapse of lenders, etc...  But this documentary really gets down to the underlying cause of this all.<br /><br />Though many of the terms might be unfamiliar in an economic sense, such as 'derivatives' (I only know them from Calculus!), the filmmaker does a pretty good job of illustrating these aspects and their application in economy.  There is also a pretty complex interaction between lenders, investors, and insurance that could give any Economics or Math PhD student a lot of meat for a thesis paper!  The film does explain these well and without 'dumbing it down'.<br /><br />The documentary shows that the main people behind the economic bubble and resulting recession acted knowingly and willfully despite the obvious foreboding signs.  In the end, most of these CEOs, consultants, and politicians walked away without criminal charges, and without losing a single penny of their own money.  Instead these gentlemen have net worth of several millions of dollars while the average American struggles to pay their bills. Or loses a home to foreclosure.<br /><br />Matt Damon is an excellent narrator.  His even, matter of fact tone fits the style of the documentary well.  In fact the overall tone is somewhat incredulous.  It seems as if the filmmaker is just shocked by events and wants the viewer to share in the same mystified, stupefied reaction.  He wants us to say, \\"Are you kidding me?  Really?  This guy said what?\\".  I don't know if it was truly an Oscar deserving documentary since I have not seen the others (though I hear Restrepo was a favorite), but it is very good.  On the Blu-Ray it comes through clean and crisp, but I don't really think it is necessary for this film on the HD format.  There is a brief montage of Icelandic countryside in the beginning, and a couple of nice overhead shots of various cities (mostly NY).  It's really up to the individual's preference.<br /><br />This is a MUST SEE, but I'm not sure if it's worth purchasing.  I checked out the Blu-Ray version at my local library.  Perhaps hit it up on Netflix or Red Box first.n the beginning, and a couple of nice overhead shots of various cities (mostly NY).  It's really up to the individual's preference.

0312427999|5.0|Very good language easy to understand and well documented. The ideas of the book are very recent and give answers to many questions regarding politics and their control from economic factors - economists and businessmen/multinationals.

B004I8WD7S|5.0|First, I have used a few cases with the iPhone 4, including the Incase Snap, Apple Bumber, Hex Code Wallet, and Incipio NGP. They all have their amazing points, as well as their faults. The Amazon Basic TPU is by far the best I have used so far, and I will definitely be sticking with it. It fits the phone perfectly snug, is sturdy, adds great protection to the phone, and doesn't add much bulk whatsoever. The smokey see through design also shows off the original iPhone design. Perfect!  - The Incase Snap is thin, sleek and looks amazing on the phone. Unfortunately it is extremely flimsy and adds almost no protection to the phone. The upper corners crack very easily, and I went through two before finally taking it back.   - The Apple Bumper is a great solution that doesn't add too much bulk to the phone and still shows off the great design, but the silicone breaks down and the case ends up being useless. I have also heard stories of it scratching the edges of the phone.   - The Hex Code Wallet... Sexiest iPhone case ever made. Hands down. It covers the phone and makes it look like a tiny leather Moleskine notebook. The problem though is after a couple of days you start to miss the usefulness of being able to hold the phone while you use it, as well as the use of the camera (the case covers it). It got returned... If you don't care much about using the phone, or the camera, this is the case you want. So hot...  - The last case I used was the Incipio NGP which is almost identical to the Amazon Basic TPU, except that the material is just a little too loose. The left side of the case (where the volume is does not fit snugly. It is loose and just sort of hangs there, which makes the case feel cheap. The Amazon case solves this completely, with a stiffer TPU material. It also includes a free screen protector.   Do yourself a favor and get this case! Buy two actually!
B001AP11KW|4.0|Pegging \\"Broken Boy Soldiers\\" as a Jack White album would be depriving yourself of some really rocking power-pop. Those other guys - Vocalist Brendan Benson, drummer Patrick Keeler and bassist Jack Lawrence - aren't household name enough to really call this a super-group, but they are old buddies. In fact, only Benson has had what one calls any serious success as a writer performer prior to this, and mainly as a power-popper with a serious fetish for classicist 60's pop. Which is what makes \\"Broken Boy Soldiers\\" and The Raconteurs so interesting; it indulges White in some cool 60's psychedelic pop (the title song) as well as shakes Benson loose from his usual mode (especially on the initial single, \\"Steady As She Goes\\").<br /><br />What BBS also does is show what White can do when expanded out from the confines of The White Stripes. The Raconteurs have some serious muscle, and they flex it well. They also are smart enough to to overwork the issue, as the album clocks in at barely a half hour and 10 songs total. It's also cool to note just how well Benson and White blend as singers, making some of the pop harmonies here positively charming. On the other hand, given the way White bent the landscape for The White Stripes, you won't hear anything earth-shattering on BBS. (Given how radically the follow-up, \\"Consolers of The Lonely\\" would veer towards more raucous guitar rock, the traditionalism of \\"Broken Boy Soldiers\\" is even more surprising for its normalcy.) What you get is a solidly created power-pop rocker that holds its own against all of White's over projects, as well as gives Benson a little more street cred.
B001FEA9QU|1.0|The first time I listened to the album I thought I must have gotten it through dark Napster channels 10 years ago ;)  The sound quality was so poor that I even picked it up with a simple MP3-player. However, this was from the CD that I had bought. After I researched and read about this totally irrational and stupid \\"loudness-war\\", I am more than disappointed at having ruined one of the most promising albums of Metallica since \\"...and justice for all\\".  Thus: \\"...and remastering for all!\\" --> Metallica, do your fans a favor. On the guitar hero version, you could also do it!  Thanks!
B000001ESF|5.0|Rush jumped a creative canyon in 1976, when they released their science-fiction epic \\"2112.\\" It was pretty much the moment when drummer Neil Peart mastered his writing skills, basing the entire first side on a socialist empire taken down by a guitar slinging rebel. It was more adventurous and ambitious than anything on the band's initial three albums, and also finally put the spotlight on Rush's virtuoso musical chops. Even with the dopey dedication to 'the genius of Ayn Rand' on the cover, the first half of the album was brilliant. A perfect lure for teenagers who thought prog-rock was to arty and not loud enough.<br /><br />In fact, that side one suite is so amazing that it even saves the album from dropping below a five star rating. Because like it or not, side two is mostly run-of-the-mill hard rock, down to the obligatory stoner anthem (\\"A Passage To Bangkok\\"). \\"Twilight Zone\\" fares little better. The ballad \\"Tears\\" is probably the best of the second half of the album, and Geddy Lee's lyrical contribution to the disc. The stadium ready \\"Something for Nothing\\" is exactly the kind of 'raise your fist and yell' concert pleaser, and ends the song on a high note.<br /><br />\\"2112\\" is still the gateway Rush album. It took them a couple more tries to make another brilliant album (\\"Moving Pictures\\"), but this was the moment it was obvious that this trio was on to something bigger than the sum of the trio.
B005HV6Y5W|2.0|Trite dysfunctional dramatics are linked with nothing less than the creation of the universe in what must be the single most pretentious film I've ever seen.  Radiantly beautiful cinematography and fervently whispered poetic voiceovers and only vague whispers of anything as base as a \\"plot\\" or \\"characterization\\" make this an unbelievably empty experience -- like flipping through an art history text while listening to some self-help audiobook.

B00004T9AS|1.0|I love Mike Oldfield, and even really like his early to mid 80's pop output (\\"Moonlight Shadow\\", \\"To France\\", \\"Family Man\\") but this is what happens when the execs at the record label push you to make even more commercial music. I admire for Mike actually doing it in the early 80's, but doing it his way. This album is nothing more than pure pop fluff which sounds, well almost embarrassing. And the cheezy synths that were so in vogue make this album sound completely dated. This review may sound a bit harsh but I am tired of record companies ruining good artists' reputations and making them pump out substandard garbage like this in the name of the BOTTOM LINE.   Even if you're a die hard fan, I'd say skip this one.

B005IF5H2S|4.0|I admit that I was really pretty disappointed with the album originally. On the first few listens, it was very difficult to distinguish tracks from one another with the exception of the only hard hitting \\"Friday Night.\\" Even now that I've come full circle and really appreciate the album now, I can't really argue too much with critiques that say it's a bit of a snooze. However, it really grew on me and there are some really great tracks on it. It's not quite as solid as \\"Lady Antebellum\\" in my opinion but probably about on par with \\"Need You Now\\" in that it has a very studio/produced sound to it. \\"Somewhere Only Love Remains,\\" \\"Just A Kiss,\\" and \\"Dancing Away With My Heart\\" present the album's strongest efforts offering some great lyrics and harmonies. The rest are Lady A standard and a great listen but nothing fantastic. On the whole, the whole thing is very easy to listen to so well worth the purchase.

B005EHNMWM|5.0|I  am a huge Wilco fan and own all the albums, and i have to say i wasn't a big fan of the last album and was VERY happy to hear the new album. I think it's one of the best albums they have come out with since Sky Blue Sky. I got to see them live a few days before the album was released and couldn't wait to get the album in my hand. I'm very happy with it, and you shouldn't miss this one.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|By far the best of the bunch books. I couldnt put it down, it's the longest of the four, but i finished it in the least amount of time.
B0052VUNHC|4.0|I found this book by just trolling the online shelves.  I wasn't sure what to expect at all, but the blurb sounded interesting, the price was good, so I went ahead and took a chance.  I am so glad that I did.  I hadn't heard of this author, or any other books by her, and I see that it appears it was self-published electronically.  Doesn't matter.  This book was a pleasant surprise and was so much more than I expected.<br /><br />Yes, the blurb is cute, but there's actually a lot more to the story than is covered in the blurb.  It is a very character-driven story and there are, for most of the book, only about four or five characters really.  The story follows Abby, her friend America and her boyfriend, and of course, Travis.  Of course the real story was Abby and Travis.<br /><br />I've read romances before where you have a protesting heroine who meets a sexy guy who charms everyone else and wow, wonder of wonders, she wants nothing to do with him.  It's not usually believeable, but Abby was serious about it.  And the author did a great job making her protests realistic.  Travis is sexy, interesting, and you just can't help but love him to pieces even though he's a male slut at first.  Abby is his friend.  And things go from there.  The tension between these two was absolutely perfect.<br /><br />I can't really remember when I've read a more sizzling romance between two characters.  This author did a fantastic job on this story.  It was simple, sexy, and had some really good serious pieces that mixed things up just right.  I loved it.  I hope the author puts out more!!

B005NN4PPU|5.0|I am at a loss of words to fully describe this album.  I had previously reviewed \\"Undiscovered\\" several years ago and thought that CD was his best effort.  However, he has underestimated me again with his talent.  This album is superb and brilliant and without a doubt his best CD to date.  However, it is much too early to say this right now, because I strongly feel this young man has star quality and star potential to be the next \\"Stevie Wonder\\", if he connects with the right producers on his next album.  Why he didn't win best new artist and new album several years ago is beyond me.  His singing and voice is so soulful; it is as if he is singing directly to you from deep inside his soul.  In my opinion, this is what is sorely missing from today's music, which I find very disappointing and lacking in quality.    So far my favorites are: \\"In My Dreams\\"; \\"Beautiful Life\\"; \\"All Around the World\\", \\"Say Something Now\\" and of course \\"The Awakening\\".  If there is anyone out there that truly appreciates good quality music like I do, then this CD is it.  It has my five star rating and if I could have added five more stars, it would have been icing on the cake.    By all means, buy this CD and closely follow this young man's music career; he is going to be the next great superstar, mark my words.
B000WMFZMY|4.0|In keeping with big budget extravaganzas, the biggest film composer of the age was brought in for El Cid.  Mikos Rozsa.  No other composer produced film music of such lushness and grandeur. Listen to the love theme in the movie.  One of Rozsa's best pieces. Right  up there with Ben Hur's opening title sequence.  It's no accident that Rozsa's film scores have been in continuous publication for 50 years. Recorded and re-recorded by numerous orchestras.
1423140591|5.0|I love this book. Rick Riordan did it again. He brought Percy Jackson back and added a new twist to the story of Percy's life making it as fun and entertaining as before. I didn't want to put it down once I had started reading it because it was so good. Riordan had me on the edge of my seat the whole way through. I can't wait for the third book to come out and I hope it is as good as the first two in the series.
B0007DFJ0G|5.0|For me, this film defined the essence of Generation X angst in the 1990s. Sadly, in light of 9/11 and the subsequent recession and Iraq War, it now seems a bit dated (Tyler Durden's claim that \\"we grew up in a time without war\\" where men are suffering a spiritual emptiness borne of too much prosperity and self-indulgent consumerism (the Clinton years) is just a distant memory now but the film's anti-consumerist rant still remains relevant in debt-ridden, underwater mortgage America. The last shot of the buildings being blown up (and collapsing in a pancake-like fashion, in the same manner as the World Trade Center towers) continues to chill me to the bone every time I see it. This film fascinated me before 9/11 and now it feels even more emotionally devastating than ever, given the times we now live in.
B00338QENI|5.0|I'm not scientific.  The only class I ever failed was chemistry and I barely squeaked by in my other science courses while making straight A's in all others.  Even though the subject matter was intriguing, I was hesitant to read this at first.  I was afraid it would be dry, boring, and confusing.  To my surprise, I found this book fascinating.  I read it several months ago and I continue to think about it on a weekly basis.  Henrietta herself is fascinating.  How the book came to be is fascinating.  The way the medical field was revolutionized is fascinating.  How such a reputable organization could do this woman and her family so wrong is fascinating.  The author does an excellent job of juggling all the parts to this story.  She makes the medical parts easy to understand, even for a someone like me.  She is sensitive to the family and to John's Hopkins.  Neither are portrayed as complete villains or saints.  I will read this more than once.  I continue to recommend it to my friends.  Read it, you won't be sorry.

1450400957|5.0|My husband goes to the gym and I work out at home. This book can be used by those learning exercises at the gym or at home. There is some good advice about stretching but no specific stretches are given. I could also appreciate the section on the aches and pains of weight training. For the first few weeks it can be difficult to push yourself but your body will adapt. What I liked most about this book is the detailed pictures showing you which muscles you are working out during various exercises. There are also tons of full-color photos showing you exactly how to lift the weights. I think this book will be useful to anyone working out whether they are following videos like the P90X workouts or going to the gym.<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review
B004W2UBYW|5.0|This was an exceptional biography written about one of the greatest people of our time.  As I read the book, I liked Steve Jobs less and less, the picture painted of him was that of a socially maladapted narcisist, but still I respected him more and more for the amazing things that he was able to do: creating the first computer animation studio, and taking a company from the brink of bankrupcy to the most valuable company in the world.  What makes this book different than other biographies I have read is that it was written while he was alive, but aware of his impending death.  It gives the book a unique feel to it, knowing that the words it contains were spoken by a man who just recently passed away.  Most books like this are written long after the subject is dead, such as Isaac Waltersons biography of Einstein, but this is diferent.  It is a living legacy, constructed by a dying man so that he could be remembered, but he did not exersize control over the content.  In fact, Steve Jobs never even read the book, saying that if he was alive in a year he would consider it, but he didn't want to upset himself given his current state.  The only aspect of it that he controlled was the cover design, which indeed shows the design talents that made him so succesfull.  This book takes us from Steve Jobs's childhood, where his parents, though not college educated managed to provide for him in every way, through his education, where he ultimately dropped out of college because he couldn't see the point, although he continued attending classes, through his experiences with Japanese Zen practices and Indian Budhism to his days at apple, where he founded a comapny that \\"though differently.\\"  It goes from there to describe the products he created, and why the suceeded, but also why the failed, and why he failed and was ousted from his own company.  From there it chronicles his \\"days in the wilderness\\" where he founds two important companies, NeXT and PIXAR, and falls in love several times.  He returns to apple, and revolutionizes silicon valley again, and again, and again.  It finishes by describing his eventual defeat by cancer, and how he accepted his death as inevitable, but continued working even on the day he died.  I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in Apple, computers and technology, important historical figures, silicon valley, comeback stories, or even just someone looking for a great book.

0399536108|5.0|When I sat down to read this book, I didn't know what to expect. It was recommended to me by an acquaintance - one already on the path of living a life of non-conformity. AONC had just been released and hadn't yet hit its full stride.<br /><br />Thank goodness I took a chance. Months later my life has been changed. I left my corporate job and set out on my own to start a business - called Unconventional Innovations (thanks to Chris Guillebeau for putting Unconventional in my head to begin with.)<br /><br />I tell you this because when I look back at my journey, the Art of Non-Conformity was the first in a series of dominoes that set me free and started me down a path to a life of fulfillment and living the life I have imagined.<br /><br />So the question then, is not whether you should by this book... but rather - can you really afford not to? The world is waiting to be changed in each of our own little ways, and Chris Guillebeau has provided a catalyst in the form of this book to set your best self free on the world. Step 1: Order this book and let it challenge you to think differently!<br /><br />I don't think you'll be disappointed.

B00425S1H8|4.0|The adapter arrive before the estimated date in good shape.. You can't ask for faster shipping and better price. The only reason I didn't give this adapter 5 stars is that the included usb drivers are out of date and don't work. Fortunately there is a small sticker on the cable directing you to their website, where the latest and working drivers can be downloaded. Once these are installed the adapter works as advertised.

B004I8WD7S|5.0|I wanted a clear or opaque case for my iPhone 4s (Verizon) that was simple, included a screen protector and that I knew would fit the slightly adjusted button locations on the 4s.  This case and the Amazon Basics clear case fit the bill at a great price point.  My wife and I ordered one of these and one of the clear so our phones would have different cases.  Both work great, the smoke on my 4s and the clear on her iPhone 4.  They offer the amount of protection we were looking for and make the iPhone a bit easier to hold onto.  The other concern I had was making sure the phone could slide in and out of my pocket easily and there's no problem there with this case.  The screen protector went on both iPhones fine with a little patience and the help of the included applicator.  The key, as with all screen protectors is to apply it in a fairly dust free environment (try the bathroom a few minutes after a shower), peel the backing off slowly starting from the top and peeling down as you press the protector down with the applicator.  The best part is that once the case is applied the edges overlap the screen protector and hold it in place.  We haven't noticed any loss of touch sensitivity or discernible visual distortion.  The case is slightly rubberized but still takes some coaxing to apply, which only means to me that it fits as it should.  The only complaint I have is that Amazon doesn't offer the smoke case in the same design as the clear.  I would rather it didn't have the hole in the back to display the Apple logo, just to keep even more dust out.  But in the end the case seals against the back of the phone pretty well so I don't see it being much of a problem.  I spent a lot of time looking for the right case and was very pleased to find Amazon offering it themselves.

1451648537|1.0|I laughed when I saw this book in my mothers bathroom, but casually thumbed through it anyway...  The only real innovation he accomplished was how to sue to stay on top.  He never invented anything, and the reason he was such a success as a \\"salesman\\" or \\"icon\\" for apple, etc. is for no more reason than the snake oil sellers of old were such a success.  Steve Jobs is a man that should be forgotten, as his influence on society is mainly negative.
1451648537|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and was amazed by details.  The followings are some notes that may help to read this book.  The following facts tell that Steve was not just hooked by counterculture as a fashion, but sought \\"different,\\" alternative ideas to view the world by studying them in detail.  In his commencement speech at Stanford, Steve said, \\"Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid the trap of thinking you have something to lose.\\"  Jobs here quotes the words of Japanese Zen Buddhist monk, Dogen in his _Shobo Genzo Zuimonki_, 1st Volume, Chapter 7.  In his interview* with CNN, Issacson seems to make a slight change to the quotation from Steve, that reads at the very end of his book:  \\"That when you die, it doesn't just all disappear. The wisdom you've accumulated. Somehow it lives on.\\"  Here Steve may refer to the Title of Lotus Sutra, \\"Such is the force of my wisdom, its supreme light to shine for aeon(kalpa).\\"  *from the article titled, \\"Biographer: Mortality motivated Steve Jobs\\"
0307946711|4.0|I didn't know much about this book prior to reading it, just that it was being turned into a movie and people liked it overall.  So I came into the book with few expectations, and although it took me awhile to get used to the format of it simply being a snapshot of the lives of Emma and Dexter on their \\"anniversary\\" every year, I quickly understood why people enjoy this book so much.  Because it's just a lovely, honest story.<br /><br />Admittedly, I spent a lot of the book wondering why on earth Emma would put up with Dexter.  He is such a stereotypical, slightly famous jerk - alcohol, drugs, women.  A very frustrating guy to read about!  But I feel like he's someone we all know a variation of, which ultimately lends credibility to the real-feel of this story.<br /><br />Emma, on the other hand, can be pretty endearing at times.  Like all of us, she makes mistakes and I definitely found myself shaking my head at her, but Emma is the kind of lady I'd like to know.  Why she maintains a lingering love for Dexter for so long is honestly beyond me, I don't think I could do it, yet I think we all know that person we are always there for despite their bad behavior.<br /><br />The romance between the two of them is largely one-sided for much of the book, but I did find myself coming around to Emma's way of thinking as we watch Dexter grow throughout the course of their friendship.  As a reader, I found myself just wanting them both to be happy, regardless of how they necessarily get there.  I guess you could say that not too far in, they felt like friends of mine as well.<br /><br />I was a bit taken back by the end of the book, but then again, much of this book wasn't what I expected.  To say the least, I adored the journey it took me on, the range of emotions I felt, and the way it seemed like this could maybe even be my own life.  I was very impressed with the author, in fact I went straight to my goodreads list and added his other novels to my list.  I can see myself becoming a devoted fan of David Nicholls as time goes on, and I hope you will be too.<br /><br />Oh, and I'm rather disappointed that the movie isn't in my local theaters anymore, so I'll have to wait to see it when it's out on DVD!as time goes on, and I hope you will be too.

B0053YGYO4|5.0|This was the first Coldplay CD I have ever listened to, so unlike most people I was not expecting a certain style of music. I only purchased this CD because it was a new release and I had heard of the band Coldplay before. This purchase was on a whim.     This is definitely a CD that you can play while driving or walking. The CD starts off upbeat, which I liked, then kind of mellows out towards the end. The CD has a great intro. The intro meshes with the second song of the CD which I thought was neat. My favorite song on the album is \\"Major Minus\\".   Final Verdict: If you want some upbeat tunes to listen to throughout the day, this CD is perfect for you. Buy This CD and support the artist. If your on the fence about buying the CD, YouTube of the songs off of it to see if its your style.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|Let me first say that this album had to grow on me and let me also say that I'm somewhat disappointed, however still think a lot of it is great. That said, what's clearly missing is a few things. 1. seems like the ablum was kinda thrown together, most of the songs barely hit over 4 or more mins. Songs go waaaayyy to quickly, which unfortunately for songs like Charlie Brown, Hurts Like Heaven, Don'.t let it break your heart and Up with the birds, it's ending way to fast. We're missing those fantastic crescendos in songs of old from Coldplay, ala Viva la vida, XY, Rush of Blood to the head. 2. the slow songs or ballads are ok...don't hold a candle to Fix You, The scientist, Warning Sign, Lost (although, Lost isnt a ballad) but you get the point. 3. Why oh why have Rhianna on  this album? Princess of China could've been fantastic (and I like the direction of the electronic type stuff, I love electronic music) but it comes on a Coldplay album, yes? then lets have Chris Martin sing more upfront and less on the background. Frankly, its out of place..it's a Rhianna song w Chris Martin in the backgroud, no lying here whatsoever. 4. Lastly, the closing song, Up with the birds...for me personally, It's gonna be bloody hard to top the fantastic and probably one of my favorite Coldplay songs, Death and All his Friends..from the last album. That song ended things amazingly. Here...we dont get really any sing along type verses...we get a little bit and only a little bit, but again...the song ends before 4mins.b 5. What's with the 3 interlude tracks...felt robbed...they barely serve anything. while they sound good, they're barely there. At least Life in Technicolor went for a good 2:30 mins. That I could've lived with  All this said, it's still rocking Coldplay and I will always always be a fan...I just feel like us fans new and old got left out of so much more that could've been included. Who knows...fingers crossed there will be a re-release just like Viva La Vida did w/their double disc version, which I have and is fantastic. We shall See.
0739384171|5.0|Lisbeth Salander is Batman.  Her vibes dark and strange--like Batman, if he were a young bisexual, tattooed, pierced woman with a `tude.  A crazy, mixed-up kid-like woman to whom terrible things happened and who now seeks to avenge those who hurt--especially those who hurt women.  Both are wealthy and smart and extremely adept at figuring out puzzles.  And even though Salander doesn't own a Bat-suit, she's nearly indestructible.  Which, at the end, is nearly this novel's downfall. Yet, under the spell of a Coleridgean-suspension-of-disbelief, I fell for it.  I love Lisbeth.  Lisbeth Salander is Batman.<br /><br />(I thought my observation unique until I googled \\"Batman\\" and \\"Salander.\\"  Just goes to show how the Internet has exposed the illusion of the unique idea.)<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" is the second of the \\"Millenium\\" trilogy of mystery suspense novels by the late Swedish author Stieg Larsson.  The first book, known in English as \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" was an international best seller.  It has been made into two movie versions, a Swedish film and a soon-to-be-released Hollywood production.  I hold \\"Dragon Tattoo\\" in high regard: dark and forboding, with boldly drawn characters, it is smartly written.<br /><br />This second book I regard almost as highly.  It picks up where the first volume left off.  The author provides enough information about what happened in the first book that a reader new to the trilogy could conceivably start with this book--but I wouldn't recommend it.<br /><br />\\"The Girl Who Played with Fire\\" opens with a sequence in the Caribbean.  The events that take place there aren't referred to after the opening pages, so what are we to make of this?  Is it further character exposition?  Is it a foreshadowing of themes?  Is the story picked up in the third book (\\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest\\")?  The pages that follow, which introduce the main story arc, move quickly: Mikael Blomkvist, a famous journalist at Stockholm's \\"Millennium\\" magazine, is working with freelance journalist Dag Svensson to publish an explosive expos&eacute; of the Swedish sex trade industry and its associated human trafficking, a book that will reveal the identities of johns among the police, the press, and security service.  Dag and his wife, a graduate student whose research provided the substance of his book, are murdered in their home; there's a third murder, that of an attorney, that same night.  Salander, a brilliant researcher and once assistant to (and recently estranged former lover of) Blomkvist, is quickly connected to the three murders and becomes the prime (and only) suspect; she becomes a fugitive from the police.  Blomkvist maintains the conviction that Salander is innocent.<br /><br />Most of the rest of the novel concerns the police investigation and Blomkvist's personal attempt to exonerate her of the crimes.  There's a mid-book slump as the police detectives persist in adhering to invalid assumptions.  It picks up again with an improbable but nonetheless enjoyable sequence involving a professional boxer and his attempt to rescue Salander's lesbian friend.  The book's greatest weakness happens to be the final climax and denouement; although fun to read, it did considerably strain the story's credibility.  Moreover, there's a lot left unresolved; one assumes that these loose ends will be taken up again in the third book.<br /><br />\\"The \\"Girl Who Played with Fire\\" by and large lives up to the quality of the first book.  Of course, the satisfied reader of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" will want to read this book.  That reader is unlikely to be disappointed, nor stop with this installment.<br /><br />Finally, a shout-out for the outstanding reader, Simon Vance.  For me, a good part of the pleasure of these books is listening to Vance's oral interpretation of Larsson's prose.  Sure, in my review of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,\\" I praised Vance but also mocked his Dragan Armansky, saying he sounded like Count Chocula.  Okay, Armansky *still* sounds that way to me, but by and large Vance's interpretations are splendid.sounds that way to me, but by and large Vance's interpretations are splendid.
B004XN3FHA|5.0|I purchased two of these, one for myself and the other for a friends house warming with a massive park for a backyard in the boonies. Bottom line: It's worth it.  If all you care about is to barely make out shadows and shapes in the dark, then perhaps some cheap plastic flashlight with a couple of Ds would suffice. This here folks is a quality piece of engineering throughout, and should you need to, can put the hurt on  someone if needed-either with the beam or the butt of the light. Battery life is exceptional, the throw is incredible with a nice wide beam. I use Eneloop batteries myself for just about everything (kids toys you know) and they work very well in this light removing any guilt of overusing a light that takes 8 AAA batteries.  [[ASIN:B004UG41XW Sanyo NEW 1500 eneloop 8 Pack AA Ni-MH Pre-Charged Rechargeable Batteries]]<br /><br />Comes in a nice case with extra o-rings.  If you are into flashlights like myself , do not expect this to compare to the 65W HID flashlights on the market, however those have a shoulder strap for a reason. This unit is nice ,heavy, and compact. Compared to my 12volt 9\\" garage light, they are very comparable in throw though that light only last approximately 20 minutes in the massive searchlight before dying off completely. This flashlight on the other hand does not dim over time as the current is maintained till the end which is over 2hrs on full thrust.<br /><br />Overall, yes, it is a flashlight. However, a Mercedes is just a car. It is up to you to decide if you would rather have something that barely gets the job done, or something that gets it done very well.
0385528752|5.0|This book, in my opinion, is life changing.  It has principles that work for all facets of life.  I was looking for a book to help me break unhealthy eating.  What caught my attention was the subtitle: How to change things when change is hard.  There is nothing in the book about weight loss at all but the principles laid out work. It was very interesting and very clear to understand.  I am amazed that I found the answers to my struggle with weight in a book that is not about weight loss. hahaha I recommended this book to the VP of Sales at our company because he needed answers on how to make changes with the sales force.
B005H0IW6W|2.0|This a Christmas CD with no original songs. All of the songs on the album are remakes of classic Christmas songs. After listening to this album for a couple of minutes I felt like I was listening to a Frank Sinatra parody, which is not a good thing. I also dislike the fact that every single song on this album is slowed, even the upbeat songs, to around the same pace. This album got old very fast.  Final Verdict: I do not recommend buying this album. If you already have a Christmas CD, this is nothing special. If you do not already have a Christmas CD, I recommend you buy Frank Sinatra's - A Jolly Christmas from Frank Sinatra. I only say that because this truly sounds like a watered down remake of that CD.  ******MERRY CHRISTMAS*********

B002ZG98LO|5.0|I may be leading the charge on this one but I think Predators has to be the best Predator movie that's ever been made. Dare I say, even better than the original in many ways.<br /><br />Predators tells the story of a group of strangers who wake up in a remote location only to find themselves pawns in a deadly game devised by their mysterious captors: The Predators.  Soon, they realize that they're not on Earth but an alien planet which is being used as a game preserve. Will all of them survive and figure out a plan to make it home? Lol, well--you'll have to watch it and see.<br /><br />One thing Predators does wrong, in my opinion, that the original gets right is the fact that-in this movie-you can pretty much figure out out who's going to bite the bullet next.  However, what it does get right is keeping up suspense and tension enough and then delivering a satisfying conclusion. Too many movies these days fall flat in that area.<br /><br />I actually was more impressed with this movie than I was with the AvP movies. This one got back to the basics of why the Predators do what they do. Even though I liked the AvP movies, they were a little too(how shall I say) polished(and shallow, I'm afraid) for my tastes. Predators made it dirty again, more testosterone-fueled...and that's a good thing, especially for this franchise.<br /><br />Without giving too much away, the ending leaves things pretty much open for a sequel. I would love to see one but not so long a time between films. Definitely bringing back Adrian Brody and Alice Braga.<br /><br />Heck, it'd be nice to even see Arnold make a return to the series...at the very least, to put a good ending to the franchise. I can wish, can't I?
0062060554|5.0|This was a quick read for both me and my coworker.  At first, I thought - I did not want to read a book where she has to re-learn her life every single day.  Just too much like 50 first dates or groundhog day.  But every few pages you learn a little bit more about her past life and you learn just enough to wonder what will happen next.  And it's soooo suspensful.  I thought I had it figured out but with 30 pages left, I still didn't know exactly what was going on.  I agree that the ending was rushed.  Those last 10 pages were jam packed with information.  and I wished it had ended a little bit differently but overall I was so happy to have found this book and I'm not one for reading these types of novels.  Very well written.  Would recommend to anyone!

B004DK49DW|1.0|Easily the worst album in Social D's catalog. Mike Ness fanboys will swear by anything he does, but this is just awful song writing. I have read some people say its a more \\"mature\\" sound. The sound maybe, but the lyrics are more juvenile then ever. They sound like a grade schooler wrote them. Every line rhymes and its always predictable what word he will rhyme with. Even down to the name of the album. Lazy song writing. At least lyrically.<br /><br />I can appreciate them trying something different but this album just reeks of generic cliches to me. Ill stick to my memories of the classics from social d. There are no future classics to be found here. Only a forgetful boring attempt to be different musically while writing dumber lyrics.

B004SIP73U|5.0|This is a film about faith, as it pertains to the catholic church.  The nun's struggle is the everyday struggle one endures in such in a top-down system of authority, where one only judges and questions those below them in the chain of power, and implicitly trusts those above.  In the church, the female clergy obey the males and have faith in their judgement and character - only those above them in the chain of command are to judge and question them.  So, for example, when they see the priests drinking, feasting, and acting rowdy, the nuns keep to their simple meals and humble lifestyle as don't question whether the priests are acting wrongly.  The nun, however, begins to suspect the priet may be molesting a young boy - or, he might be the boy's only friend and ally in the world - she isn't sure, but breaks from her place in the church and investigates - and struggles with the fact that by doubting those above her, she is abandoning her religion.  This film really explores and explains the difficulties the church faced in uncovering the molestation scandals, and why the church's reponse might have appeared to be a cover-up.

B005LY4B0A|1.0|After having trouble finishing a round I asked for a hint.  The hint had me cut the strings in an order that wouldn't guarantee safety, but when I did the first cut as instructed the spider went away from the bugs instead of towards them.   That's when I realized that the spider isn't some sort of algorithm which tries to get to the bugs using the quickest path, but instead it's programmed to react in certain ways based on the order you cut the strings.  In other words, you're not using logic to prevent the spider from getting a bug.  You simply have to guess in the way the developer wanted you to guess.    Truly a stupid game.

B003Y5H5JM|4.0|I confess to reading few of Shakespeare's written works and only one outside of required reading in high school; none of which were The Tempest. Previously, all I've known of it was that it was probably Shakespeare's final play and was made into a film by Derek Jarman in 1979. This latest screen adaptation is directed by Julie Taymor, who previously helmed the Shakespearian film [[ASIN:B000E6ESKS Titus]]. That film received mixed reviews, while The Tempest has had a mostly negative reception. Whether this stems from critics' familiarity with Shakespeare's version or they truly think it's a bad film, I liked it well enough to be inspired to seek out the Bard's work and I found it to be an effective take on the story.  The gender of the main character has been switched to female and presented as Prospera (Helen Mirren), the duchess of Milan, who was cast out of Milan with her young daughter Miranda by her brother Antonio (Chris Cooper). After spending twelve years stranded on an island, Prospera decides the time has come to seek revenge and she causes a tempest that wrecks the ship carrying the King of Naples, Alonzo (David Straitharn), his son, and various subjects including her brother. With the help of a spirit named Ariel (Ben Whishaw), Prospera separates the crew and awaits their arrival.   The film is noticeably beautiful from the opening scene and with film credits like [[ASIN:B002G1K82Q Across the Universe]] and stage credits that include the Broadway version of The Lion King, it's no secret that Taymor is a visual artist to some degree and her vision of The Tempest is both bold and unique. As the writer and director, she has fashioned an adaptation that sticks closely to the Bard's original words while creating a vision so completely her own. An American director, she brings a distinctly Euro-flavor to the execution and a lot of style without taking away the substance of the story. There is a lot of CGI in The Tempest, some of it striking and some of it laughable, yet it never undermines power of Shakespeare's writing. I am not well-versed in the language of Shakespeare and, as such, I must heap praise upon a movie that draws me in enough to forget that I'm listening to Shakespeare recitation.   This is not a perfect film but its imperfections may have been too closely scrutinized and with all there is to appreciate, The Tempest has gotten a bad rap. The performances, especially from Mirren, really breathe life into the film. Mirren brings a power to her delivery that makes the switch of gender seem like a true creative decision rather than a gimmick and she carries this movie, proving she's one of the great working actresses. Djimon Honsou as Caliban, Prospera's slave, is animated and unconventional. Since his Oscar-nominated work in 2006's Blood Diamond, he hasn't remained prominent but his performance here reminds the audience of the power he can bring to a role. Alonzo's butler Stephano and jester Trinculo are played by Alfred Molina and Russell Brand respectively and provide some uncontrived comic relief. Brand may not seem like an obvious choice, but he adapts to the material naturally and despite a career based on his stand-up inclinations and his work in the comedy genre, he does have a background in stage acting. Brand has attracted a lot of hatred (especially on the internet hate machine), but his Trinculo should silence any doubt that his talent extends outside the comedy genre. Trinculo is not an ultra-dramatic role, but most can attest that simply reading Shakespeare's dialogue convincingly is not an easy task and Brand sounds completely natural with it.  The Tempest is an undeniably stylish film, although some stylistic choices are questionable. The film occasionally dips into the musical genre, with characters singing some of their lines a la Across the Universe. This is a choice that works occasionally, but mostly seems forced and I'd venture to say that the use of music is the biggest flaw, especially in regards to the ill-placed rock music that makes the film feel like a parody of itself. Whenever there's a scene that plays like a bad joke, it seems to spawn from the music within the scene. The use of music and the music used is the biggest flaw without a doubt.  The Tempest couples beautiful writing with beautiful visuals and doesn't look or feel like a mainstream product. It's beautiful to look at and fascinating to watch, a film that has reinvigorated my interest in Shakespeare and has prompted me to seek out The Tempest in its written form. Taymor may not have directed the most faithful, coherent, or perfect adaptation of a Shakespeare work, but she's brought one that adds a little something extra to already proven material. Whether you focus on the words and ignore the visuals or vice-versa, this film is an experience; which is more than many directors could hope to bring to the table. It's hard to recommend this to a certain demographic, as I'm neither a Shakespeare fan nor a non-fan...But this is certainly a production worth checking out.  GRADE: B+

B0053YGYO4|3.0|I'm a big fan of coldplay since I first heard X &Y  Great, great album , Coldplay's best album , for my opnion) .  Viva La Vida was different from their older stuff . This album was good but still different. I can used different music but I found my self listening to this album less and less . Now , 3 years later the new album here and what can I say , it's not bad but it's not too good either . Their are 11 songs cause the other 3 tracks are instrumental between 34 -49 sec . I think the instrumental tracks on this album have no meaning and they are too boring ... Some of them have no connection to the next track and it seems those tracks should not be part of this album  U.F.O can be included as short track too cause thi track is only 2:18  .   I tought the track featuring Rihanna will be bad but it seems to be one of the good songs on this album .   Songs like \\"Charlie Brown\\" and \\" Us Against The World\\" could have been much better . I think Coldplay missed something with those two .   The good :  Hurts Like Heaven   Charlie Brown   Us Against The World  Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall   Major Minus  Don't Let It Break Your Heart   Princess Of China  The Bad :  All the rest   My conclusion is , the album is good but Coldplay could do better ...   Anyway , I'm not sorry I bought the album  Even if I wasn't happy with the album I still was happy to have it , since I have all Coldplay's albums ).
0385344325|5.0|ITS GOING TO BE DIFFICULT TO REVIEW THIS BOOK.  IT STARTED OFF A LITTLE STRANGE, ESPECIALLY WITH HIS APPEARANCE AND UNIFORM.  I PUT THE BOOK DOWN FOR A DAY OR TWO UNTIL I FELT BETTER THEN REALLY GOT INTO IT.  I KNEW SOMETHING WAS WRONG RIGHT AT THE FIRST, BUT OLE' LEE CHILD DOESN'T WANT YOU TO KNOW TOO MUCH.  HE BEGAN PIECING THIS TOGETHER AND I THOUGHT A BUS RIDE AND A HIKE WAS A LITTLE OUT OF SORTS FOR AN MP.  WAS I WRONG!!  THIS FIT RIGHT IN WITH THE ENTIRE COUPLE OF DAYS HE WALKED ALL OVER TOWN.  I HAD THE WRONG PERSON PICKED FOR THE DASTARDLY ACTIONS ABOUT 3/4 THROUGH THE BOOK - DID I HAVE EGG ON MY FACE.  REACHER DOESN'T DISAPPOINT.  HE'S TOUGH AS JOHN WAYNE TOILET PAPER, HE'S SMARTER THAN THE USUAL PERSON OF HIS CALIBRE.  THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY DISAPPOINTS ME IS HOW MANY DAYS HE WEARS HIS \\"DRAWERS\\".  THIS WAS FOUR DAYS AND I KNOW HE DIDN'T CHANGE FOR AT LEAST 2 DAYS PLUS.  CHILD NEEDS TO LET HIM CARRY A LITTLE DUFFLE BAG (MANLY, NOT LIKE A HOOKER CARRIES) THAT HE CAN KEEP CLEAN DRAWERS AND A SHIRT OR TWO IN.  I DON'T THINK HE CHANGED SOCKS AT ALL.  THIS WORRIES ME A LITTLE.  YOU GOTTA ADMIT THE CHARACTER IS DIFFERENT.  OUTSTANDING.

B004Q7DQLS|5.0|PNR is not my favorite genre.....but this book was special. Not because of the world building or storyline, although they were good. It was all about Dragos and Pia. Their growing relationship was a joy to read. He was fascinated, intrigued, aroused and humored by her but used to giving orders and being dominant in all things and oh so possessive, typical uber alpha male.  Pia was feisty, brave, quick, sensual, funny and wonderfully compassionate. Her love and patience and humor and her desire to understand Dragos slowly tamed the beast. She taught him to love, to be kinder and to be more understanding. This book had it all....the sizzle, the characters and the story.

B002MW50KO|4.0|The voice is weathered, but the soul is joyous.  This album defines holiday cheer, it doesn't feel forced, it feels alive.  I want Christmas songs to put me in the Christmas mood, I'm a little more forgiving with them, and I have to say this album is excellent.  It's got a good mix of secular and religious songs, and good production values.  It's not a slick album with a singer hitting notes perfectly, it's just fun.  In the age of over-produced samey sounds, this album really harks back to a different era.  I personally think it's the natural sequel to Love & Theft and Modern Times, which are two of Dylan's finest albums.  The songs on this feel timeless because they've been a staple in the holidays for many years, but with an expert in music like Bob Dylan in charge, you get a feel good album.
0316010669|1.0|Thin slicing works, except when it doesn't.  The premise is interesting, but Gladwell fails to actually draw any meaningful conclusion from his anecdotes.

B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I think what I like the most about this movie and Cap is that he is a below average guy that was given a opportunity of a lifetime due to his will, courage and humilty he had inside him. The process he went through allowed all of these qualities to physically manifest. If you ever been the little guy that never gave up or back down, this movie really hits home in a lot of ways especially for me since I know Exactly what Rogers went through growing up. Cap isnt super rich intelligent or born with a mutation. He's just a good person who refused to give up on his dreams no matter what people told him. This is why Captain America is the best comic book hero movies that I have seen yet.
B002GYI9C4|3.0|The plot moves along fairly quickly and doesn't bog down too much, though it is at times a bit predictable. I am thankful that the author actually tied up some plot arcs at the end of the book instead of leaving a bunch of stuff hanging. The magic system is well thought out and interesting. The writing isn't all that great, pretty flabby and not too inspiring, but the story is told well enough. I might read the sequel.

1451648537|5.0|I have admired Steve Jobs since the first day I met him in 1984. I followed his entire career, marveling at the Macintosh, lusting for a NEXT, watching beloved PIXAR movies with my grandchildren, bemused as everyone else at the stream of insanely great products Steve and his Apple team brought to the marketplace with such love and brilliance. I also was keenly aware of Steve's behavior, so nothing in this book surprised or upset me. I had no illusions that Steven P. Jobs was \\"a nice person.\\"   I am frankly amazed at and disappointed with people panning this book because they didn't like the candid way Isaacson presents Jobs or because their rose-colored glasses came off in the process of reading it. This book is probably the best biography I've ever read and, as an author myself, I am an avid reader. Isaacson's treatment of Jobs is well-balanced, his research meticulous, his objectivity (mostly) clear-eyed.   The book is intricately woven, absolutely compelling and far from disappointing. As I read it, I found myself stunned by the skill with which Isaacson created such a rich tapestry of his controversial and highly complex subject. STEVE JOBS is a book for the ages, perhaps slightly flawed by the speed with which it was brought to press. But for those of us who dearly loved Jobs the legend, it was healing to learn more about Jobs the man. The void in our lives left by Steve Jobs' passing will never be truly filled, but the heartache is lessened by knowing more about the support Steve had from former foes, a loving family, and loyal friendships that spanned his lifetime despite his odd personality. I would not have wanted to wait for this biography, and I doubt there will ever be another that will even come close to Isaacson's treatment. Bravo!

B000SEGTI0|4.0|Somewhere between 3 and 4 stars, giving it the nod because I am a fan of Dick's writing and I think the movie sort of ruined it for me. Sadly, I watched the movie before reading this book. They are very different; the book is a whole lot better. In fact, I'm kind of irritated at Ridley Scott for screwing it up so much when he took it to the big screen.  I've always enjoyed Philip K. Dick's inventiveness and his depth of thought. I've read at least a dozen of his short stories, and his ideas are always interesting and surprising. This book is no different.  At 200 pages, this is a quick, enjoyable read. Dick's writing isn't always the best, but it's clear and to-the-point.  There is some weird stuff--Mercerism, in particular. But it is still intriguing and thought-provoking. I definitely recommend it.
B000OLGCI4|4.0|Arrived in a timely fashion, packaged well.  Just what I wanted for my son.  Couldn't find this DVD in stores.  Am well pleased!
0316056863|5.0|I could not put this down! If you like Tina Fey, I don't see how you could not love this book. Hilarious stories about growing up, working at Second City, SNL, and 30 Rock. I rarely give book reviews, but feel very strongly about how great this is. Quick read- I devoured it in days (and found myself laughing out loud alone in my apartment).
B0036TGT3E|5.0|What a wonderful story for young and old alike.  Our grandchildren have not seen this yet but I am hoping we will all enjoy it on Christmas Day.
1609611543|5.0|Very informative. I enjoyed the author's sense of humor and use of analogies to explain scientific processes for a clearer understanding. I've been convinced of his message that sensitivity to wheat is not simply an obesity issue, unhealthy of itself, but also affects the brain and overall health beyond my previous knowledge. Reading this has provoked change in my life. I can no longer be complacent with the affects wheat and carbohydrates have on my body. I admit that despite my symptoms, I've been lazy concerning the eradication of wheat from my diet. No more thanks to Dr. Davis; I'm inspired to get serious about my health and eliminating this enemy.
B005NJ2K6U|1.0|Neat game, but crashes on average at least once per round. Makes a good game unusable. Samsung Fascinate.   Update: Tried playing it again and this time it deleted all my scores and completed levels.
B004EPZ07U|5.0|It's a Hollywood movie, and I've come to terms that they will never treat the source material with any respect. This movie I actually had fun watching. It was good, but not great. Maybe I liked it because I didn't go into the theater expecting an Oscar winning movie like most critics do. Redbox it if you aren't sure, but I had a good time watching the movie.

B0058YPG1G|5.0|This is the best show on TV, It is worth every penny and it will not disappoint. I would recommend watching the first three seasons before starting this one. Buy them all it is amazing.
B005J4TLN4|2.0|well, the hype made me look and thats all it took to realize that this is justa brit teenage fantasy flick with unrealistic action and improbable teen dominance.  oh, not to mention cheesy effects  like 1985 status).  someone else already mentioned the strained use of slang....like the fresh prince of bel aire trying to be a G in the hood; contrived...those boys all came from silver spoons and its obvious. right on par with the rest of this director's weak, nerd realm movies. those who compare this with e.t. or  even aliens are so far outta their league its laughable. a red box rental wasted and a dollar not sorely missed.
B00177YA1K|5.0|I had seen this flick before when I had the VHS version years ago and enjoyed it.  So, once I got my DVD collection going, I decided to do what I call 'DVDify' as many tapes as I could while I had room.  I had planned to get the deluxe version of this, but that one went sour.  Anyway, I decided to cut my losses, cancel that one and picked this one up.  I'll admit that I had yet to watch this one, but since I had the VHS version, I pretty much know what to expect.  I also picked up the sequel to this which I saw a little bit of, but didn't watch the whole thing.  I wonder what MIB III will be like since it has come out today in theatres.  If you are a fan of will smith (rapper or actor) go for this flick
B004ZNARH4|5.0|This set contains some excellent material. Highlights are the 2011 version, the original Alan Parsons version, the Live tracks, the Bonus Tracks, the few Bonus Video Live songs and especially the Surround Sound mixes. The other small additions were nice also like the book, Marbles, Cards and Coasters etc.. The only thing that was disappointing however still interesting was the Bonus Screen Films. I was really hoping that we could hear the band play along with this live but it is just the backing sounds that went along with the screen film and nothing more. Even if there was not a live take available to play along with the screen movies having the music available from the actual album version would have been a real treat to play along with film as you watch it. As it is in the Immersion set it is only a small gift that is appreciated but will not get near as much mileage as it could have. In summation though these Immersion Sets are worth every penny so far.
1401207529|4.0|This is a really good book to pick up, especially if your just getting into Batman. There's not much else I can say about it other than its a really good way to tell the beginning story of the most dark vigilante of all time. But I can also see if your already into Batman that this could bore you, but I still liked it.

No amended book has arrived, yet the book is still being sold on Amazon.  So is the book being sold on the site now the one with the correct recipes or are they still selling the  one with errors?   I love the book but would like one with recipes that I can trust and use.
B000RIWAVW|5.0|I remember seeing this a couple years back and loving the movie. It's not gory at all and you see barley any blood (the violence is left to the imangination) which is a plus for me since i don't like gory movies.<br />Just make sure not to watch the Rob Zombie remakes of Halloween (2007 \\"remake\\") and Halloween 2 (2009 version) they are horrible! If you would watch any other Halloween movie i would watch Halloween 2 (1981 version) next. It's takes place right after the original Halloween when Laurie is at a hospital that same night.

I bought it on my Kindle at the price of 4.99, but would have gladly paid $20 for this damn book.... I read it straight through in one day.... couldn't put it down.... Jamie McGuire is a damn genious... can't wait to read more of her stuff....   These two characters and their friends... will take you on a journey that will make you feel like you're right there with them... like one of the gang... from the fights, to the makin' up, to the jealousy... OMG!!!! I was hooked from the first few paragraphs... went through a 1/2 box of kleenex, a six pack of beer, and a bag of Dove chocolate while reading this.... guess it didn't help that I read it while I was PMSing... but whatevah....  You really really need to check this book out... you will be pleasantly surprized.... I know I was... in fact... I'm enrolling at Eastern University!!!  LOL!!!  BUY IT PEOPLE!!!!!
1423140591|5.0|I'll make this review completely spoiler-free. What can I say except that Rick Riordan does it again? If you had any doubts that Riordan would have trouble following the amazing first installment in his Heroes of Olympus series, put those qualms aside. The Son of Neptune is just as fantastic as The Lost Hero.<br /><br />Some technical notes: Riordan follows the same formula as his previous book, this time alternating between the viewpoints of Percy, Hazel, and Frank. He continues to succeed where he did in the previous book, properly introducing the new characters and slowly revealing their respective histories. The three-person narrative also does well in giving each of the characters time to shine. None of them ever simply feels \\"along for the ride.\\"<br /><br />So many elements make this book a blast: the brand new world of Camp Jupiter, the impossible quest the demigods have before them, the return of old friends, the introduction to interesting new characters, and the engaging way readers learn of the distinctions between the Romans and the Greeks. As usual, Riordan manages to weave a compelling and epic adventure that perfectly integrates humor, charm, action, and drama.<br /><br />The best thing about this book? The return of our favorite half-blood, our hero from Rick's first series, Percy Jackson.
B004P8JPS6|5.0|Just another great installment.  Every story delivers, except that one about Reacher supporting soldiers going AWOL.  That was just dumb.  Can't wait until next year Mr Child!!  Reacher is my fictional hero.
B004DNWPY4|5.0|This review is for the Kindle edition of the book.  I first read this when it came out 15 years ago while still being fairly early in my professional career, saddled with a lot of debt from graduate school and really trying to figure out where I was going to be several years down the road, and what I wanted to do when I grew up (many people would argue I still don't know).  When I saw this available one day for a discount in the Kindle format, I picked it up and just completed re-reading it.  This review reflects my attempt over the last 10-15 years of trying to implement the lessons and observations discussed in this book.<br /><br />No matter what age you might be when you read this book, I guarantee you will recognize people from your walk of life - you might even say the names are the only things that are different; you will also recognize a picture of yourself (good and bad), and if you do an honest assessment you will recognize some areas you can improve upon with your own life.  That's true for me when I first read it in the 90's as well as today.<br /><br />While it has been 15 years since this book was published, and many of the statistics in terms of current incomes may be dated, the principles remain the same: follow these principles, implement a plan - and stick to it, and you will be well on your way to a better picture financially.  While I will not call myself a millionaire, after trying to follow a lot of the guidelines of this book for a decade, my financial picture is one heck of a lot better, and I am almost at the \\"multiply your annual income by age, then divide by 10\\" calculation for optimal net worth.  The information in this book is not rocket science, but good practical advice on how you can consume less, save more, fund the kids' college education, and still maintain a great standard of living.  These lessons should be given by every parent and handed out to every kid growing up.  As a CPA in real life with 20 years of professional experience, I would hope I know what I'm talking about - if you follow the advice given in this book on a consistent basis over a period of time, you should also be in one heck of a lot better position financially not only for you, but most likely for your kids and grandkids, too.e, I would hope I know what I'm talking about - if you follow the advice given in this book on a consistent basis over a period of time, you should also be in one heck of a lot better position financially not only for you, but most likely for your kids and grandkids, too.
B004P8JPS6|1.0|I read this overnight.  Not hard to do since most of the book is of Jack Reacher going into buildings, sneaking around fences, eating cheese burgers and fries and taking telephone calls.  Tedious.  Yes.  He beats up a gang of red neck types, he murders a militia type in cold blood, kills a number of other bad guys and gets the girl.  He befriends an ugly kid who happens to be african american, honest, the kid has a problem because he is ugly and then sends the kid to his death.  Oh yeah, the plot.  Pretty girls are getting killed in this small town.  Jack figures out who did it and then kills them.<br /><br />Jack Reacher flashes back to 1997 in this book.  Before 9 11 we are repeatedly warned and Jack grows a beard.  We read carefully how this growing is progressing.  Lee Childs takes the opportunity to correct a bit of Deux Ex Machina from previous books, like how come the character Jack Reacher just happened to walk into a small corrupt town in his first book, just in time to see his brother murdered in the said town, somewhere off the map.  We also learn why Jack retired and we learn here that Jack sometimes kills for the heck of it.  Or because he is mad.<br /><br />I think that the writer here was just funning this time out.  Playing with the reader and enjoying his joke.  Too bad the joke was the book.  Waste of time folks.  But if you already bought 14, well heck, one more aint gonna hurt.
B005XI4WFS|5.0|Last time I watched an episode, I slept with a hammer next to bed.  Very entertaining.  Lots of explicit content though - I'd feel uncomfortable watching it with anyone under 18.  But, if you're grown and you want to go from scared to oddly aroused, this show is for you.  Very creepy.
B004XQO90O|5.0|Everything Jake touches since Prince of persia turns to Gold.. and I'm becomming a big fan. When it comes to time travel I'm usually the authority on it, and this movie gives you clues that the technology could be just that. You will love this movie. The movie keeps you guessing on 'what is he' and that is what the movie is about.  I tried to make guesses and my mind came up with something totally different. And I'm sure Jake didn't want to know either.  I kept saying where is he!!!!!!!!!! What did they do to him????? And how cna he get out. And later, why would you want out?
B0016PUV5C|4.0|Here's m thoughts on this movie: it's \\"The Most Dangerous Game\\"... but with a masked alien instead of a creepy guy with a satanic goatee. And that basically sums up this gory, suspenseful sci-fi thriller. which starts off as your usual macho BOOMBOOMfest but quickly mutates into something far creepier once the soldiers realize that there's an alien stalking them.<br /><br />Major Alan \\"Dutch\\" Schaefer (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and his team have been assigned to rescue a cabinet minister kidnapped by guerillas in Guatemala, which seems like a straightforward mission at first. And the guerillas seem to be an unusually brutal bunch -- while some of the pursuing soldiers have been captured, others have been brutally skilled and left to hang in the trees.<br /><br />Dutch's team basically blows up the entire guerilla compound and everyone in it, except for one woman (Elpidia Carrillo) that they take prisoner. But on the way back, their numbers start dwindling -- one soldier is dragged away and gutted, and another is shot through the chest with an energy blast. Something far worse than the guerillas is stalking the team through the jungle, and the unknown Predator is determined to kill everyone worth hunting.<br /><br />The first half of \\"Predator\\" is about a military operation with lots of gunfire and explosions, and the second half is a harrowing, blood-spattered chase with the men getting picked off one by one. Yeah, the plot isn't very complex, but it's handled in a very intense manner -- lots of sweat, dirt, grease, jungle foliage and sudden eruptions of blood and firepower.<br /><br />There are some plot holes, though -- Jim and John Thomas brings up some suspenseful conspiracy stuff about evil CIA agents in league with the guerillas and Russian agents. Then it... just sort of gets forgotten.<br /><br />Fortunately John McTiernan adds huge bucketfuls of suspense and gory horror along the way. Since the alien is invisible, there's the constant feeling that something horrendous and brutal is lurking in the underbrush, and there are some powerful moment like Billy's final defiant stand or Mac saying farewell to his friend.<br /><br />Arnold Schwarzenegger is... well, \\"Ahnuld\\" -- kind of wooden, very muscular, and fairly capable of the whole tough soldier thing. The other characters are sparingly but well-sketched out, such as Dutch's old buddy Carl Weathers, Bill Duke, Shane Black, Sonny Landham, Carillo and Richard Chaves. Jesse Ventura is completely two-dimensional, though -- and I wished Landham's character had shown a bit more dimension beyond \\"stoic Indian tracker.\\"<br /><br />\\"Predator\\" has some holes and a rather simple plot, but the superb direction and cinematography are pretty darn brilliant.

1423140591|5.0|I love these books. I'm a college student and I still love them haha. Read it! It's so good!! I haven't gotten to the good part yet in this book but it's still good so far.
0312576463|5.0|I download the sample chapter of Freedom on my Kindle without knowing anything about it - I hadn't read a review, nor did I know anything about Jonathan Frazen, the Oprah pick or any of the controversy that seems to be playing out here.  I was immediately taken with he first chapter.  I finished the book today - it is long, and there was a moment where I couldn't believe there was so much more to go - but once I got past that moment, I wasn't ready for it to end.  Freedom is beautifully written - the characters are multidimensional, their communication complicated and eloquent.  I found myself loving each of the Berglands in their flawed states and rooting for each of them as they found their own freedoms.    I loved Freedom.  I laughed, and cried, and will miss it.  Yes, it wraps up in a pretty little bow... and that itself IS the surprise. With all the twist and turns I wouldn't have wanted it any other way.  Thank you Jonathan Frazen for a wonderful ride.
6303314015|5.0|I ordered the product for my niece, who is almost 2 yrs old. She absolutely loves watching it. This was the only Disney movie we did not have in her collection. It was great to be able to get the movie on VHS. My order was actually delivered earlier than expected and that was a wonderful surprise.  Thanks.
0062112430|4.0|This will be my last dystopian future novel for a little bit since I'm starting to fear for the future, but Delirium was a good one and I am so glad I read it. Lena Holloway lives in Portland, Maine in a US where borders have been completely shut and love is considered a disease. In fact, it is considered such a serious disease that when you are 18, you are \\"cured\\". Cured adults live without the pain of love and with their matched partners. They go about their daily business without the worry of making bad or emotional decisions based on love. Lena is actually looking forward to this calm future when she falls in love and all hell breaks loose.<br /><br />I was expecting this book to be a little sappy, but it's actually a very good read. Lena's character is truly conflicted and that conflict adds a depth that I was not expecting. There is something so sad about the world in which this book takes place. If you've ever had your heart broken you can almost see where the officials are coming from when they describe the symptoms and perils of romantic love and how it can go terribly wrong. Without love there is no romance, but there is also no love given to children or family members. Love, in its entirety, is wiped from your consciousness. Lauren Oliver does an excellent job of taking you through the steps of Lena's realization and the discovery of her past. The bittersweet ending was sad, hopeful and utterly perfect. It definitely deserves a place on your to-read list this summer.
B0054N73EY|3.0|RHCP's new CD has some flares from the old, loved Chili Peppers. Their new chart topper is a hit and definitely deserves a head-bob and sing along. I was a little disappointed with a few tracks. I actually got this CD for my boyfriend's birthday. He is a die-hard RHCP fan and has been forever. After a week of listening to the CD in his car, it made it's way into by passenger door storage panel and hasn't left since. I was hoping for more but am satisfied with the few tracks that remind me of older times :)
193413712X|4.0|A beautiful, complex and lyrical book.  An outstanding achievement for a first time novelist.  I can clearly see why it won the Pulitzer award.
B00004CZ9S|1.0|This shipment took many weeks to receive. when I did get it, it wouldn't play. I found out it was for a different region......not able to play here in US or Canada. They didn't make it obvious in the product that it was that way........you would have had to scroll all the way down to see it wouldn't work. Why didn't they mention that it wouldn't play in the US next to the title where it would be easily seen and realized? Now they want me to ship it back to get a refund......which will probably take another month, if I get one back at all. I will NEVER order fro them again.
B004EBUXI0|5.0|I bought this for my custom PC. I wanted something powerful but still give me value. Amazon had a good deal for this chip and I got it. I would recommend it if this is what you are looking for. If not than go AMD or a different Intel chip. If you reading reviews for this I hope you have some knowledge of computers. Its all down to what you the builder wants and what your are willing to pay for.
0439023521|5.0|I read all three of these in 6 days, I couldn't put them down!  They have just a hint of romance for the girls, but I could definitely see men reading them too. The dystopian world she creates is near enough to reality that you can picture the terrain and imagine the villages, but far fetched enough that you can immerse yourself into the fantasy of the capitol. It has the action of the games, the love side story, and the political backdrop - what's not to love?!
B003ZHVJFK|2.0|For starters, don't let the title fool you. This film has about as much to do with Tekken as the Friday the 13th films have to do with the television show. They used the names and some of the character designs, but nothing else (and only very little of even that). The movie bears a closer resemblance to Bloodsport crossed with Blade Runner.  In terms of plot, it's rather cliché. If you've watched more than one Kung Fu flick in your lifetime, chances are you've already seen everything they do here. It's a typical plot about a young fighter who enters a tournament to get revenge for the death of a loved one. It's got an artificial romantic subplot, one-dimensional filler characters, an archetypical villain, stormtroopers, etc... I don't really mind that they didn't stick to Tekken bible, but if they were going to change things the least they could've done was come up with something original. Instead we get a movie we've seen a thousand times before, but with different actors. Yay?  The Cinematography is terrible. Apparently Mr. Little is one of those directors who thinks that violently shaking the camera during action scenes as though you have epilepsy adds tension or some sense of danger. All it does is make it very difficult to tell what is going on, and gives you a headache. Everybody says the fight choreography is great but I honestly couldn't tell you, I had no idea what was going on half the time.  In the end this is neither a tekken movie nor a good action flick. You're much better of watching an old Bruce Lee flick or just playing the video games than investing in this thing. My advice? Stay away!
B003L77G6A|4.0|I will agree with some of the other reviewers that this season was not quite as good as the other seasons.  I particularly agree (to a certain extent) with a comment I saw about the addition of Amy and the decrease in the interaction between Sheldon and Penny.  I agree that Amy has, to some extent, decreased some of the interactions between some of the other characters, and I often wished Penny was around more.  One of the best parts of previous episodes was watching Penny and Sheldon slowly coming to understand and even like (or at least care for) each other.<br /><br />However, I do not feel that Amy was a worthless, or even a bad addition.  I don't think she by any means ruined the show; I just wish they would make sure in the new season to not have her pushing other characters to the side the way she sort of did in this season.  I think the addition of both her and Bernadette have almost added too many main characters; while I understand they are necessary and I would not advocate taking them out, I think some balance needs to be found - the story is primarily about the core group of friends and their neighbor, and that needs to be reclaimed.<br /><br />That negativity aside, I still LOVE the show.  I know some people think it is not an accurate reperesentation of \\"geeks\\" or even find it offensive, but the characters often bring to mind friends of mine; particularly in the WOW segments (and make me laugh almost as much remembering real life experiences as at the show itself).  I enjoyed Amy; it's really funny to see her and Sheldon try to deal with emotions (and physical reactions) that they have obviously never had to handle before.  Further, the same group dynamic is still there, and still as funny as ever.  Sheldon in particular is still fantastic; I am so glad he has won awards - I feel he truly deserves them.  All in all, I definitely recommend.
1594481717|5.0|I thought it was a very interesting book. He makes some very intriguing and revolutionary observations about the economy, and how people interact with each other. I'm not sure how convinced I am about his main premise that jobs of lawyers, engineers, and doctors will all be outsourced and the best jobs to have are landscape architect or nurse. This to me seems far-fetched, or at the very least something that I don't believe will effect me significantly in my lifetime. What I really enjoyed though in this book was his advice and information on how to become more \\"right-brained\\". I think everyone should take his advice and use some the things he offers. He does a great job of placing a \\"portfolio\\" at the end of each chapter on his six aptitudes, where he specifically offers techniques, websites, etc. to help you improve that specific aptitude. At times the book can be redundant about his idea of how we are too left-brained focused, but he makes up for it by taking the time to offer advice to the reader on how they themselves can specifically improve the six aptitudes of right-brained people. Definitely recommend, lots of interesting opinions, information, and advice.
B004EPYZP8|3.0|I wish I could give this 3.5 stars...I feel three stars is a little bit low, as it was enjoyable and I will probably watch it again (I bought it before viewing).  However, I don't think it really warrants 4 stars.  As a fledgling attorney, I wasn't all that happy with the way the justice system is portrayed here (particularly the star attorney).  I know he is meant to be a \\"hero\\" as he is lashing out at the bad guy and helping to free the innocent man, but I had a hard time liking him because of his methods.  NOTE: I know this is probably a minority viewpoint, so if you don't think this will bother you, I would recommend it as a good watch.<br /><br />As as I said to my husband after the first 45 minutes or so \\"oh so many ethical violations\\"; whether he thinks he is doing the right thing or not, the main character commits numerous ethical violations at the beginning, and again at the end after he realizes what is really going on - I am tempted to play a game and see how many I can spot the next time I watch it. While this is not a bar to enjoying the movie (as I said I did enjoy the plot), I found it hard to like the main character because of it, and as an attorney I didn't appreciate the portrayal, particularly - and I find myself hoping there are very few attorneys like him.<br /><br />Furthermore, the story would have (in my opinion) been even more interesting if it had delved into how the legal system ACTUALLY handles such situations; it has happened in real life, and there are cases out there that the author could have utilized.  \\"Truth is stranger than fiction\\", and has the benefit of being truth.  While I don't think inaccuracy or \\"fluffing\\" of a character necessarily detracts from a movie or book, I think it did so here, at least for me.  The story could have been done equally well (probably better) without such a sleazy main character.
1933308087|5.0|Really \\"wow\\" describes this book perfectly. This book has almost every quilt block you could ever imagine in it...and they're all in COLOR! It does not have instructions for constructing every single quilt block in the book...but for most avid quilters, I don't think it would be too difficult for them to figure most of them out. The book starts by explaining to you the different grid constructions used to make quilt blocks (which will help you figure out how to sew them together) and then gets to the pictures of blocks. At the bottom of each page is a reference to the above blocks showing each block in a drawn out grid-like format (which again helps you visualize how to piece them). I also really liked that 2 transparency grid pages were slid into the back so that you can play around with creating your own designs. Overall, a wonderful representation of quilt blocks and, for me, a must for my quilting library.
0061537969|5.0|What a beautiful book!  I was in a public place when I began the first chapter and that was the only thing that stopped me from sobbing out loud. It grabbed me and kept me interested- I was sad when it ended.  What a heartwarming, sweet story about a man and his dog, told from the dog's point of view.  Easy to read, funny and sad- well worth reading.
0439023521|5.0|This book was very suspenseful, and the build up hardly declines in this story of fightings, journey, survival, and romance. This book was so suspenseful that at the end I read the last seven or so chapters in one night. Here's a summary:  The story takes place in the somewhat distant future (familiar to people who have read The Giver, The City of Ember, The People of Sparks, or other future-setting books), when the country of Panem rises from ruins of what was once North America. Every year, just to keep Panem under their thumb, the capitol hosts the annual hunger games. In the hunger games, two tributes are chosen from each of the twelve districts(one boy and one girl), who are forced to kill one another(while managing supernatural wilderness survival!) until one tribute, the victor, remains. Our main character is Katniss Everdeen of district twelve, the less-than-likely to win district. She is heroic and without fear of killing another tribute. She is troubled in thinking that she must kill someone from her own district, thus creating the problem of the story. Upon being the victor after a long, chaotic, and heart-breaking game, she is troubled by something she did to embarrass the capitol. The book ends here, leaving you hanging so that you HAVE to read book 2.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|I upgraded my phone from 3Gs to 4s recently, before I received my phone, I had ordered a case made by Incipio, didn't really like it because its black color and my white phone don't really go together, so I did some more searching online and came across this one made by Amazon.com itself, it's transparant and my phone looks great with the cover on. And the price is very good, for less than $10, plus you can tell amazon.com didn't go cheap about it, the box and everything else is of top-notch quality.
1609611543|3.0|This writer has a point, but I think he over does his thesis that changes in the grain itself has made it the fault. Over consumption is not given enough emphasis as a result.
B004A8ZX28|5.0|Liam Neeson never fails to entertain.  If you like movies that you think you have figured out, check out this one.  Gave it a 5 star rating, very good movie.  Highly recommended.

B005J3IEZQ|1.0|Perhaps because it was rushed to press after the death of Steve Jobs, this book is in need of a great editor.  Every chapter has repetitive themes as though they are being introduced for the first time. You don't need to tell us 50x Steve dropped acid and it changed his life, once will do. The narrative is uninspiring, and you wish a better attempt was made to illustrate the drive and enthusiasm behind the creative mind. There are nuggets of insight, but it is as though they needed development. Steve would have been disappointed with his biography regardless, but he would have been livid that it was rushed and delivered so poorly.
B005869U6G|1.0|The band that once rocked is over, at least for now.  Sure, they could come back and rock hard but I'm at such a loss with this record.  So soft, de-balled & full of ballad-esque songs that are void of the famous Incubus melodies.  At this stage in their careers, they are fully entitled to create any record of their choosing.  But they will lose their hard core fan base if their next record continues on this path.
B0053YGYO4|3.0|This cd isn't great, and it isn't terrible. It would have been more than OK but when I heard Rihanna's voice on a song, I feel like they completely lost all credibility. Bubblegum pop and Coldplay should never mix. What happpened to the old Coldplay? I miss them and I wish they would come back. Their last two cd's have been complete misses to me. I understand the need to change it up...but pop is not the way to go. I'm a little disappointed because I feel like they've sold out. I didn't understand why people hated them so much before. Now I am starting to. I think there's too much ego going on. I disliked Every Teardrop is a Waterfall also, and I was hoping it wasn't an indication of how the rest of the album sounded, but it is. I like maybe 3 songs on the album, and I don't even remember which ones they are besides Paradise. Not a good sign. Come on Coldplay! Get it together!!!!!!!
B002O3Z50G|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised when I opened the box, I could of swore I had purchased a gently used one, but it's still got the shrinkwrap and security strip on it along the top. Unfortunately, my DVD player died a painful toddler induced death just the day before it got here, so I haven't been able to watch it on tv yet.   Absolutely love the movie though, can't imagine any problems unless it's got regional coding or something, but if it does, I'll be back to update. No updates=no problems.

B00008973A|2.0|Why on earth can't Hollywood follow the book.  They have butched so many famous books, where would you begin to name them.  With the Exception of \\"Gone with the Wind\\" which follows the book,at least the movie is GREAT.<br /><br />For instance take \\"Midnight In The Garden of Evil\\"  A book, you can't put down.  It actually put Savannah on the must see attraction of the 1990's.<br /><br />Clint Eastwood took the book and just absolutely destroyed the plot the characters, you name it and he killed them all.<br /><br />When I saw the movie I couldnt believe how far he had left the storyline some where on the out skirts of Savannah.<br /><br />Outside of Kevin Spacey no one character resemebled the books characters...To put a Jude Law as a male husler was laughable. He was too thin ....hell, he didnt even look Like Jude Law looks today.
B005F3XV62|4.0|The starting scene just caught my fancy with the failed proposal in that I wanted to see this movie through. I loved Kevin in his supporting role in Adam Sandler's Grown Ups and I just wanted to watch him again but this time the lead actor of a comedy.  He was so funny in imitating the animals in his cubby-ness. The movie had some voice over in the animals with personalities such as Sandler as the monkey, Stallone as the lion, Cher as the lioness,  and Nick Nolte as the gorilla. If you are a fan of movies like Babe, Cats and Dogs or any movie with talking animals, this might interest you.  The movie is a hit with my kids and we all loved it.

B00064WSNW|4.0|Probably my favorite album by an oft-forgotten great band. 'Frame by Frame' is one of my top ten favorite songs of all time. I never buy CDs anymore, but the lack of a version of this great album on Rhapsody or Zune made this purchase a must-have.
B005JU5JTI|5.0|If your not into just stupid humor you won't like this. But if your looking for something to just sit down and veg to, you'll love this flick. Cameron Diaz, JT, and Jason Segel all play well off of each other. Some calm moments but most of it's over the top and just laugh your a$$ off.
B00356CO1E|4.0|You are meant to do one of these workouts every day for 30 days, stepping it up a level when you feel strong enough.  I am not sure who could do these workouts every day without blowing out their knees, despite Gillian's constant promises that you don't have to lunge/squat all the way to get results.  After 2 weeks, I realized that my drive to get fit again would backfire if I continued to do this every day.  So instead I do a shred workout 3-4 times a week and walk or walk/jog 2-3 times per week, giving myself 1-2 recovery days a week.  This combination has been phenomenal. I feel a million times stronger, especially in my core muscles. Jogging uphill has become almost enjoyable (almost), if only because I can't believe how strong my legs have become.   I definitely recommend this as a complement to another type of exercise, but I would never recommend doing these workouts every day.
B005LLXB9K|4.0|A couple of days ago i watched the PJ20 Film  on PBS, granted it was edited for Language but i am imagining minus the bonus footage it was the same film and i will be getting the dvd for my collection   As i sit here and listen to the PJ20 soundtrack there is a couple of gripes with the film. Now coming from a die hard PJ Fan its not hard to be objective of the greatest band on earth but i think the gripe is more with Cameron Crowe, but PJ had alot to do with this film. The film is great dont get me wrong, but i think for the average fan not so much for the die hards. I know i am going to get pounded for this review but here it goes   Throughout the film great never before seen footage, interviews and snippets of live performances. 2 clips they played from Nassau and Philly i was there so that was great. The Film had me teary and had the chills throughout but its lacking in some areas. 1) Crowe and PJ go thru the whole history of the band, each member how they got there etc but they some how skip over very quickly the revolving drummers they have had over the years it is played off like a joke and very quickly, as much as Matt Cameron is great he is only a small piece of the bands history. 2) I was shocked to see more dedicated film time to Nirvana and Kurt Cobain then i was to see Alice in chains and Layne Staley ??? according to what has been written and said Eddie and PJ were very close to Layne (ala Mad season etc) 3) The film mentions every band known to man like Mookie blaylock, Green River and Mount Tre etc but no mention of Bad Radio? and other Eddie Vedder early bands.4) Very brief in the bands influences and what bands they appreicate it. Yes Neil Young and the Who and Hendrix are mentioned but not so much updated artists 5) The film could have been longer, it feel a little rushed and feels a little skippy, jumping from piece to piece. 6) The movie is written and directed in i would say a \\"Fans Perspective\\" not many hard questions asked.   I was super excited for this Film and did my own campaining getting everyone i know to go see it  By no means am i a critic but i am a fan and have watched enough Documentaries to see what i think was missing

0525423281|5.0|Anna and the French Kiss had been one of the best books I had ever read. Stephanie Perkins is somehow able to create INCREDIBLY real characters and scenarios that we can all relate to. And she actually DEVELOPS her characters! I love literally all of them. So as soon as I saw that she had come out with a new book, I immediately knew that I needed to buy it. So I did. And read it on my Kindle in about 4 hours. I stayed up until 2 AM to finish it. On a school night, no less! That's how good Lola and the Boy Next Door is. Quite possibly, it is better than Anna and the French Kiss. And, as a previous reader mentioned, I was so happy that Anna and St Clair were in it!! I love them. Basically, just buy and read this. I promise you will love it. I want to marry Cricket. He is the sweetest boy ever. I had butterflies just reading about Cricket and Lola's tension-filled interactions! I love this book so much that I am even unable to create complex sentences. That's how good it is. Love!
0374532990|5.0|The two guys, Joshua David and Robert Hammond, who conceived, and drove through against all odds the creation of the wondrous 'urban park on stilts' on the west side of Manhattan, were described by a journalist writing about the High Line's unlikely success as \\"A pair of nobodies who undertook an impossible mission.\\" In their book they readily admit this was true and that they knew next to nothing about preservation, architecture, community organizing, horticulture, fundraising, working with City Hall, or running a park.  This lack of expertise in these areas was the key to the High Line's phenomenal success as it forced them to bring in other people to help them, and bring the dream into reality.   The book gives a potted Time Line from 1847 to 1999 (when Messrs David and Hammond started their quest), charting the history of street level and elevated train tracks in NYC. The authors then give a detailed but highly interesting account of the struggle to overcome all of the many obstacles, frustrations and challenges to a successful conclusion. They freely admit that they had an enormous amount of help from many people and organisations without which there would probably be no High Line today, but it is also self-evident that they were the most important reason for the projects triumphant outcome. The latter part of the book is taken over with many great photographs showing the before, during conversion works, and after of this unique green city leisure space.  In a short time, if not already, the most famous attractions in NYC will be Central Park, Times Square, Statue of Liberty, Brooklyn Bridge, Ground Zero Memorial, The Empire State Building and The High Line. This elevated parkway is truly a marvel of urban regeneration which serves as an object lesson to City Politicians and Planners worldwide.  Henry David Thoreau, the renowned natural and environmental historian, was perhaps prescient of the creation of The High Line Parkway when he wrote \\"If you have castlesin the air, your work need not be lost: that is where they should be. Now put foundations under them.\\" Joshua David and Robert Hammond and their friends did just that.
0385535139|5.0|I'm not sure how he does it... but he does.  John Grisham follows last year's release of `The Confession' (easily in the top 3 best Grisham books ever) with `The Litigators'.  Immediately you get the feeling that this is going to be one of Grisham's witty ones.  This man has a wonderful sense of humor and added to his natural ability to tell a story, I see why some call him \\"America's favorite storyteller\\".  Finley & Figg are two lawyers who work, but not extremely hard, to make their living as practitioners of the law.  They bumble their way around chasing ambulances and divorces all while having more in house fighting than any season of `The Real World'.<br /><br />Enter, due to a rather CRAZY exit, David Zinc.  David is Harvard Law School graduate who makes a nice six figure salary, who is married to a smoking hot woman, but must work long hours in order to pull down said nice six figure salary.  One day he snaps, and snaps in spectacular fashion.  Grisham writes this scene and you seriously can't help but laugh as you see David becoming best friends with the elevator.  I swear, while I was reading this scene I could hear the laugh of the Joker in the background (Jack Nicholson's Joker BTW).  David continues his phenomenal downward spiral at a bar and he contemplates the universe and his life... all while drinking enough to alcohol to make Hunter S. sweat.<br /><br />Obviously the universe shares in John's sense of humor because of all the places our friend David could end up, he makes his \\"new person\\" debut at the offices of Finley & Figg.  Let the legal dysfunction begin!  The main storyline is the law offices of Finley & Figg happen upon news of a drug called Krayoxx.  Rumor has it that this drug is bad and that brings out the mass tort snakes, I mean lawyers, and the dreams of big fast money begin.  On a good day Finley & Figg dance along the ethics line, with the promise of a multi-million dollar settlement they not only dance, they take ethics to dinner and then to the prom!<br /><br />David gets caught up in this \\"boutique\\" of a law firm but manages to keep himself relatively clean.  This book gets better and better and by the time I reached the end I was staying up till 1 AM because I couldn't decide where to stop.  The climax (in my humble opinion) is the courtroom scene with the Kryoxx lawyers vs. David.  I will NEVER give away the story, but I will use a two word phase to describe it.  Actually Amazon would probably censor it so let me do it like this:  the first word begins with the letter \\"b\\" and the second word is \\"slapped\\".<br /><br />As with every Grisham novel there is back story and other stories going on.  I would love to meet DeeAnna... heaven help me.  I think I would enjoy a Sunday dinner at Rochelle's house, but I would run for the hills if I ever got on her bad side.  Finley & Figg... the antics of these two must be read.  Describing them is utterly impossible and I would fail if I tried.  It takes talent to go from serious to (almost) absurd, but Grisham does it with talent and skill that is fun to read.David gets caught up in this \\"boutique\\" of a law firm but manages to keep himself relatively clean.

0321687299|3.0|This book is a concise yet a complete and practical guide to what's new in HTML 5. Each NEW feature of HTML 5 is covered, and a history of how the new standard was developed provided. There are small but complete examples and lots of references for enhanced learning.   I found the book practical in that you can begin HTML 5 development after reading the book and by using the provided resources make sure it works in ALL browsers (yes even IE).   I knocked off two stars because there are two missing elements to the book: source code for download and a PDF version (I would even pay a small extra fee for that option).   If you want a concise but complete primer to HTML 5 this is a good book to purchase. It does assume you know something about prior versions HTML.

B00601J5CC|4.0|As you know, dramatic irony is the form of irony in which the audience knows something that key characters in the story don't know. Think of the double suicide in Romeo and Juliet. You see, in my review of the episode preceding this one, I accused the storytellers of exposing too much of the supernatural too early. With this episode, however, I see that the narrative tension within this series works because the audience knows quite a lot of information and not in spite of that fact that it does. This has also allowed for more subtle foreshadowing in the final scenes of this episode than has been seen in big-secret shows like \\"The X-Files\\". Also, the mood and tone of each scene are close to perfect, allowing me, with each episode, to buy into all the ghosts and monsters and to develop real interest in all of the characters and their [after]lives. I'm certainly sticking with this series to see how the relationships develop between the mortals and the immortals.
B005ZO6DIO|5.0|I love SOA but I am disappointed to see Piney die the way he did. I am so tired of Clay. I hope the rest of the sons put him in front of a firing squad. I am looking forward to seeing how Kurt Sutter has the future planned. I don't like some of the decisions he's made but the story is riveting nonetheless.
0312576463|2.0|I must disagree with the \\"critic\\" who attributes dislike of this novel to a lack of intellectualism.  This sounds like the sniping of some dreary academic.  Who would purchase this book if they were not up to its level of discourse?  The review detailing its shortcomings was very much on target, particularly concerning the bloodlessness of the characters and their spoken dialogue.  I might add that a novel, which in some ways is on a very similar path, but which expresses the zeitgeist far more tellingly, is \\"The White Tiger.\\"  I look forward to Adiga's next novel, not so much to Franzen's.
B004LROUNG|3.0|..but I wish I had not pre-ordered it and waited for the library edition for Kindle. Another easy to read, good story that left me wanting more.

B003UPPO2G|2.0|The Bee Gees have a great legacy of music, but I purchased this concert in hopes of enjoying the hits from their best album sound track \\"Saturday Night Fever\\" and their other great 70's hits. Unfortunately, they skirted past most of these hits in favor of songs more popular with their hardcore fans.  A big disappointment!
B005IZLPKQ|2.0|The first Spider-man film was much better then all the Marvel films that came after. The story pace was terrible, Capt. America starts out slow and about half way through speeds up as if the director ran out of time. So, plenty of action towards the end. Some of the special effects of Steve as a skinny weakling were terrible. Most noticeably when he is in the back seat of the car, his head was way to big, then he looked like a hobbit and then almost normal. It seems there is a mad rush to release these Marvel character films before the \\"Avengers\\" film release later this year. So, they are sacrificing quality, details, good writing, good editing and good acting for a quick buck. Thor and the Hulk were other examples of weak films. Chris Evans played Johnny (the human torch) in the Fantastic Four and now Capt. America??! There are ten thousand other actors to choose from!!!
1451648537|5.0|I first downloaded this as an audiobook from Audible.  It comes as 3 parts that sound great on my iPod.  Just today, I bought a hardcover copy @ Walmart for 11 dollars off the cover price.  As I've said, this book is the 2011 computer bible.  It literally takes you through Jobs's full life.  It takes you through the development of his early blue boxes with Wozniak, the versions of the Apple Computer, the Lisa computer, the Mac, iPod and iPad.  Steven Paul Jobs was the man who literally created the personal computer world as we know it, and more.  In closing, I'd like to mention something I've been pondering.  Feel free to leave comments regarding this.  It was Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak who founded Apple.  Take their two last names and put them together.  Jobs and Woz.  Change the Jobs to Job and the combo becomes Job-Woz.  Sounds like a certain Star Wars character to me, the Jawas.  Did George Lucas create the Jawas in this fashion?

This is easily the most fun game on my phone, but a bug like this is absolutely unacceptable.

6302909651|5.0|Wow, I absolutely love, love, love this movie!! Sharon Stone is again so convincing in her part, I'm so admiring her big acting talent for being able to change so radically from bold Catherine in \\"Basic instinct\\" into shy Carly in \\"Sliver\\". Her duet with william baldwin has great chemistry, and he's sooo good in his role of seducer. This film has some of the best sex scenes ever made in the movies history, so get ready to get into a playful freaky mood! I know you will love to watch this...
B005ARYEY6|5.0|Simply delighted with this official issue. The contents of this set is not new for Miles fans except two tunes from paris, #6 & #7 of CD2. Very pleased with the fact from now on we can enjoy these tunes officially. Miles performed nine concerts in this European tour. Only the London concert of Oct. 29 has not been excavated yet. Expect Columbia's further efforts to unearth this performance. Couldn't find any room to complain about these music. Full of groove and speed. Miles controlled the band majestically and extracted superlative music from the members. At the Plugged Nickel Miles was confronted with various challenges from the band members. He seemed to be very busy composing the disturbance two years ago. Somethings which changed the relation between Miles and band members must be happened during two years. On DVD we see Miles places his mute on the Herbie's piano at the beginning of the every concert, as if he sticks the holly sword into the earth. It is like the ritual to show his reigning to the band members. High expectation for the vol.2 and on of this bootleg series. Next set is '69 tour? Or '73 including Japan tour?
B001AQO3QA|5.0|This Box Set I give a lot of praise to cause it has everything. I'm a fan of Alien Aliens & Alien 3. Alien Resurrection is ok. I reviewed all 4 of these movies along with the dreadful AVP movies I reviewed Predator 1&2 & that pos Predators earlier this year. This is an upgrade from the old Quadrilogy Box Set & you still have all 4 movies as well you still get both versions of each film. You have the 1st movie Alien released in 1979 directed by Ridley Scott & I perfer The Theatrical cut of the movie The Extended Cut is cool. Then my all time favorite of the franchise Aliens directed by James Cameron which I like The Directors Cut more. Then the very conterversal Alien 3 I go through all the problems of Alien 3 in my review. It was directed by David Fincher even though he doesn't claim it because 20th CENTURY SUXNFUX constantly bothered him. I also go with The Extended Cut of Alien 3 which Alien 3 happens to be my 2nd favorite of the series. Then Alien Resurrection which is ok but it's not up to par with the 1st 3 & Joss Whedon script writing is off & on it has both cuts & really neither 1 is better than the other although in The Extended Cut Newt gets a mention. Disc's 5 & 6 have excellent features with all the trailers TV spots the makings of & TV specials. The Documenteries are great the story behind Dan O Bannon's & Ronald Shusett's script to the hiring of Ridley Scott interviews with the cast. Aliens documentry is great where James Cameron & Gale Anne Hurd fought to get Sigourney Weaver back for Ripley good interviews with the cast like Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Jeanett Goldstein. Alien 3 has an interesting documentary It bascially tells William Gibson wrote a script where Hick's & Newt live & Ripley is in a coma. Which is what they should've done in the 1st place. They go into David Towhey script & The Eric Red script which would've made an entertaining stand alone movie. Then you get into The Vincent Ward script which everybody loves but I don't. They interview every director that was attached to direct Alien 3 like Renny Harlin, Eric Red & Vincent Ward. The Documentary is uncut as well so you get to see David Fincher lash out at FOX. Alien Resurrection's Documentary is good but still don't understand why they got Jean Pierre Jeunet to direct the movies get a really good treatment on Blu Ray so The Alien Antholgy Box Set is worth it.

0439023521|1.0|The first-person present-tense narrative (\\"I gasp for breath\\") rings false all the way through, so I can never believe in the events or the characters.  If that weren't bad enough, the story is super predictable.  Listening to this (I had the audio book) made me laugh, made me angry, and eventually made me quit.
0786955554|4.0|The D&D master tiles sets are a much better value than the smaller sets. Although they come with several nice large tiles and lots of smaller tiles, several of these are reprints from earlier sets. A creative DM could make use of one set if it was a small dungeon or just creating rooms for encounters, but for a modest sized dungeon two or more sets should be used. The box the tiles come in makes good use as a raised platform, as well as the lid, for both have a 1\\" square grid that resembles dungeon floor.

B005SMUW8U|5.0|Tom Waits is everything a performer should be:  Funny, topical, heartbreaking, unique, approachable, and most importantly, entertaining.  He is not afraid to make the music he wants.  No record label is telling him what he should do to sell more, and he's not interested in recording just to make it to the top 10.  He writes and records what he wants, and we should be grateful we can share in his career.<br /><br />The songs on his newest album `Bad as Me' are unlike anything currently in wide (or even narrow) release.  The CD features songs about escape, either to a new city or from a stagnant life, about the down-turned economy, the horrors of war, the endurance of nature's spirit, or just wanting to die happy.<br /><br />Each song is its own little world spun from heartache, goofiness, dissatisfaction, snippets of conversations, odd trivia, and poetry.  And Tom Waits enhances the mood of each with the arrangements and instrumentation he has chosen for himself, Keith Richards, Flea, Marc Ribot, Les Claypool, and the other musicians playing on the album.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy this CD...

B0057R5XRG|3.0|Please describe the audio/video quality of any Blu-Ray you review.  Thanks to those who do this.<br /><br />I'm writing this review after only watching the first movie, \\"Jurassic Park\\", before reading any other reviews.<br /><br />I am very disappointed in the video quality of this Blu-Ray.  I felt like I did when I watched \\"First Blood\\" and \\"Total Recall\\" on Blu-Ray - \\"Ripped-off\\"!  First off, the aspect ratio is 1.85:1, instead of 2.35:1.  But I can live with that.  What I feel \\"ripped-off\\" about is the amount of grain in this movie.  It starts off real bad, with a lot of grain.  There is grain in almost every indoor scene - so bad, the grain sometimes vibrates.  There is good detail mostly, and most of the movie had good video quality - not perfect, but good to great.  I don't understand how they can produce such a great Blu-Ray for \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and \\"It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World\\", and then they charge more for Jurassic Park, with bad video quality.<br /><br />The DTS-HD 7.1 Master Audio was fantastic though.<br /><br />I pre-ordered this movie, and Amazon said they sent it on Monday.  I received it on Thursday.  I probably had the free budget shipping.  I am satisfied with the delivery time.
B004LROUNG|5.0|There have been some not-so-great books written by Grisham in the last few years, but this is not one of them.  This book is simply a great read.  It has hope, despair, bad marriage, good marriage, love for one's fellow man, good law, bad law, good courtroom drama.  You must read this book.
B004J4WKTW|3.0|It's imaginative, but it lacks depth. The story jumps around in time which gives the cirus a timeless feel, but it caused the author to neglect character development. There wasn't enough time or description spent on the characters for me to care if they lived or died. The story of two lovers pit against one another in a match to the death should have evoked a strong emotional reaction, but again, I didn't care enough about the characters for that to happen.

B002SR2PKG|1.0|It's over 1,000 pages, but a little editing could bring it down to less than 500 without removing any important details. I forced myself to read the whole thing, and wish I could have just let it go. Especially after I read the scene where the 11 year old girl in the group uses herself in the worst way to bring the group together. That scene served no purpose. I'm not a feminist, but it made me angry to see a writer use a young female character like a cheap blowup doll.

B0057R5XRG|2.0|Ok,<br />I know everyone is stoked about the trilogy (although, the negative reviews I've read have noted that the Blu ray transfer was subpar), but I was actually looking forward to just the first movie being released on Blu ray. I'm sure that will come out at some point, but I'm disappointed that I have to either buy all three movies, or wait indefinitely. When I went onto blu-ray.com, there is no projected release date for the first installation. Anyway, that's my gripe.
B005NJ2K6U|3.0|I liked it much better than the first one, as a free app. I don't think it has enough stuff to pay for it.   Pros: -  The graphics are much better, enjoyable to look at -  Much more polished -  I didn't want to stop playing it  Cons: -  Too short - since it's a quest once you're done you have no reason to play it again -  Too hard on the phone - battery gets very hot during extended play  It would be good if the devs created a non-structured play so there is a reason to play the game after you get through all the quest levels. Also figure out how to go easier on battery usage.

B000025H0Q|5.0|This is the key Nick Drake album to get, with its excellent production values, and fully realized arrangements.  He's in great voice, and each song gets a sensitive treatment, whether its sonorous strings, or a bopping horn section, or a quiet bluesy piano.  The sax on At the Chime of a City Clock it is worth the price of admission.  Sad he couldn't hold it together enough to make more music--sad he died so young, but many in his era's British folk scene suffered, too.  This album is haunting AND optimistic--just listen to Hazy Jane II.  A classic which creates a mood from the first to the last track.
B000IJ79UW|5.0|This DVD set contains Superman I ONLY but also includes a lot of feature stuff that definitely enhances the film and the actors. For example, the selection of a Superman and of Lois Lane is detailed. After explaining the casting decisions, the process is understood as not so easily accomplished.<br /><br />This film is the story of Superman (Christopher Reeves), from his mother and father's life on Crypton, to growing up as a man on planet Earth, to finally functioning as the super hero we all know. The mild sided Clark Kent works as a newspaperman, providing the opportunity to hear crime news. He meets Lois Lane but has more and more difficulty keeping the identity secret. Lex Luther (Gene Hackman) appears as the super villain and fences off in a spectacular showdown with Superman.<br /><br />In the features, Gene Hackman applauds Christopher Reeves for the decision to take on the role. Once typecast, Mr. Reeves would find it difficult to shake. Many humorous cuts are shown (not seen in the film) with Gene Hackman and Christopher Reeves. This gives the viewer insight into the actors.<br /><br />Similarly, many fine actresses were tried for the part of Lois Lane without success. It's interesting to discover oneself in the part of the casting director searching for the qualities needed in the discovery process.<br /><br />I recommend this four disc set.
0439023491|5.0|I was happy to see that this series didn't go the way of the Matrix movies and totally flail as it expanded into a trilogy. The story was as intense and exciting as ever. Great follow-up.
B000B5XOY8|5.0|This version of Batman is all about Tim Burton's vision of Batman as the dark knight, and agreeably the noir lends itself to better explain the legend.<br /><br />On the feature disc, Kim Basinger is shown commenting that her addition to the film is the only bright spot in Batman's life. Well okay Kim, but Sean Young, who was originally cast in the role would have definitely added to the darkness and further enhanced the depth of the noir legend. Unfortunately, Sean Young was thrown from a horse and unable to continue in the role. A great loss!<br /><br />The added features greatly add to the viewers enjoyment of the film.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I hadn't read a book in one sitting in years. Then The Hunger Games came out and broke that streak. It's just first-rate storytelling. Great protagonist, great premise, killer pacing.
006112429X|1.0|This book is boring, but I forced myself to finish. I hated all the character-- the mother was whiny, the father was an idiot, the son was unbelievable. Actually, they all were, and the story is so contrived.  The author uses \\"big\\" words, but that does not make for great writing.  She's no Jodi Picoult (who I don't like either, but at least the 2 books I read of hers were gripping.) Do not waste your time.
B004ZN9YNC|4.0|I'm going to skip the debate as to whether this is really a \\"Pink Floyd\\" album, vice a Roger Waters solo record.  Suffice it to say, if you really want an appreciation for how much Rick Wright made up \\"the Pink Floyd Sound,\\" you need look no farther than this record -- when he wasn't there.  The generic 80s-synths leave a certian dimensionality missing from this record overall.  Likewise, Gilmour seems to be mailin it in here, and even in the openings that Waters left for him to do his thing, Dave just doesn't seems to be trying.  Nonetheless, this is an earnest attempt by Waters and even if the music doesn't quite stack up against other Floyd albums, some of Waters' finest lyrics are to be found here.  If you can remember back to the original the original vinyl release, and likewise to the original CD pressing, both had a very murky sound.  This was greatly improved with the 1997 remaster, and this new 2011 remaster likewise presents an improvement, albeit to a smaller degree.  Of course, the best part of this release is that the album FINALLY includes \\"When the Tigers Broke Free,\\" which should have been in the track list right from the start.  But overall, this is so far the best presentation of this record to date.  Better resolution all around, with the bass end really nicely handled here.  All in all, if you weren't a fan of this record before, this remaster likely won't convert you.  But if you're looking for the best-sonding version available, you can't go wrong here.

If I never heard anything else that he had made, I might have given this CD a lukewarm reception.  Scratch my Back started the spiral downward.  I am all for an artist changing.  Joni Mitchell has always seemed to change without (me) feeling that she had lost something in her musical explorations.  Sorry Peter, not the dark road I wanted to follow you down on.  Disappointing!  I would have given it one star, but that's tough considering the guy is a musical genius and I know what he is really capable of.  Oh well.  Better luck next time!?

A youngster in Middle School or a youngster in a retirement community will enjoy the clear discussions of how we know what is really real as opposed to what is mythological and magical in the superstitious world that so many people inhabit. This book should be required reading for everyone in about the 8th grade. A great book about what is true and how we can know the difference between what is true and what is fiction. Thanks you so much Richard Hawkins for another winner.
B000002KHH|5.0|It's obvious from reading Black Sabbath's Wikipedia page that Black Sabbath was a major pain in the arse to the record companies; but what were four Brummies supposed to do with their lives in the bleak sixties cum seventies?  There is no denying the great music; smooth languid lines over chugging rhythms.  Darker than Led Zeppelin, Sabbath tuned down to achieve their sound; which is a very complicated process indeed.  It will take a musicologist to disentangle the two groups' musical legacies.  It's a shame that in the mish mash of the metal scene, Sabbath didn't have a stronger identity than their Brummy rivals.

B004Y1USV2|4.0|Fly From Here literally picks up where Yes' Drama album (1980) left off.  The title track was originally written for the Drama album, but was left off.  The boys (Benoît David, Chris Squire, Steve Howe, Alan White Geoff Downes and producer Trevor Horn) still have the Yes magic.  The music is broad and complex (their classical roots showing through again).  The included DVD on the making of the almbum provides a great insiders view into the creative process.  Enjoy all Yes fans out there.
1250004217|5.0|Sarah's Key by Tatiana De Rosnay is a beautifully written and gripping novel that will haunt you long after you've finished reading.  Switching between 1942 and 2002, the author unearths a French tragedy of epic proportions that is little talked about today. In fact, President Chirac was the first French leader to publicly acknowledge the role of the government and apologize to the French in 1995.<br /><br />Julia Jarmond is an American who has lived in Paris for 25 years.  She married a Frenchman, Bertrand Tezac , and has a daughter, Zoe'.  Jarmond is a journalist for a French magazine that is published for Americans living in France, and her editor assigns her to write an article about the little known Velodrome d'Hiver (Vel' d'Hiv' for short).  The 60th anniversary of the Vel'd'Hiv' is approaching, and this black mark on French history is not well known.  On July 16, 1942, the French police rounded up over 13, 000 Jews--many of them women and children.  They were kept for six days at a famous indoor stadium for bike races without food, water or sanitary facilities.  Then they were taken to camps outside the city, separated from their families, and eventually sent to Auschwitz where almost all of them were gassed.  This story disturbs Jarmond as so many people in France are unaware of this atrocity.  But the Vel'd'Hiv' becomes even more personal when she discovers that the apartment she and her husband are renovating (formerly his grandmother's apartment) was vacated by Jews who were rounded up during the Vel'd'Hiv'. Jarmond becomes obsessed with what happened to those who lived in the apartment weeks before the roundup.  She also discovers a horrible secret about the apartment.  These secrets split her husband's family and even threaten her marriage.  It also makes the journalist look at everything in her life through new eyes.<br /><br />The parts of the novel from 1942 revolve around the family who live in the apartment.  Sarah Starzynski lives there with her parents and younger brother.  Sarah is a bright little girl and her father takes the time to answer all her questions with great patience.  \\"But recently, her father had not answered her questions the way he used to, she recalled.  Her questions about the yellow star, about not being able to go to the cinema, the public swimming pool.  About the curfew.  About that man, in Germany, who hated Jews, and whose very name made her shiver.  No, he had not answered her questions properly.  He had remained vague and silent.\\"<br /><br />I have yet to see the movie, Sarah's Key, that was adapted from this book.  I suspect that it's equally as good and also, as haunting as the novel.rother.

B005G4TJI4|2.0|Like that lame Avatar release, no extras on this either. I saw it in a movie theater and this one is by far, the worst one of the three. And they want to milk it for what it's worth? How can you milk it, when it is a pretty bad movie? Stay away, unless you are a true die hard fan.
B00004WG2F|2.0|This movie's innane quality can only be surpassed by its mellowdramatic and repetitive dilogue.  In fact, you can play a drinking game with how many times the above 2-word quotes in my title were uttered throughout the film and come out totally blitzed.  Why has anyone else not noticed this, because it irritated the living fecal material out of me.  Speaking of the back door, this movie makes otherwise talented actors like Anthony Hopkins and Aidan Quinn look like jackasses, but I'm really not intending to make them the butt of my jokes...despite the fact that the post-stroke Hopkins character looks alarmingly like David Crosby on crack.<br /><br />The point is that this is a movie aimed at teenagers and discontented housewives who drool over Brad Pitt any way they can get him.  Apparently this includes Brad looking just like a homeless guy who spent too many years eating hamster poop and dog chow in a garbage dumpster, the trendy au currant actor's version of a mobile home.  His love interest is the bland, big-toothed, uncharming Julia Ormond who is constantly sticking her fingers in her mouth.  My guess is she is trying to hold down the bile while barely getting through a horribly written script, backed by a music score that wants to be a knockoff of Dances with Kevin Costner, but ends up sounding less appealing than the dinner music heard throughout Little House on the Prairie's run.  She is no Audrey Hepburn, and I have dispised her since the remake of Sabrina.  Well, I've despised her MORE.  The way she says \\"Tristan\\" makes me want to clock her one, or is it the fact that the name Tristan makes me want to clock anyone who would give that name to a kid?<br /><br />Everyone is in love with bucktook Susannah, including that looney old man of theirs who wants peace, but shoots everyone after he's got a stroke.  The preachy, hypocritical message in this silly flick doesn't even compensate for the fact that this movie's real title is Brad Pitt:  The Movie.  We have Brad the Native American--whatever that is, Brad the nasty heart-stealing (literally, folks) WWI soldier, Brad the insane version of Columbus, and Brad the hot Robert Redford wannabe bootlegger.  It's Brad, pretty as can be, all clean shaven on a horsie with his long flaxen locks flowing in the wind.  It's Brad in a manly uniform avenging his dweeby little brother's death.  Brad beats up a bartender.  Brad is bearded, scuzzy, and mean to horses.  Brad looks all doped up in some foreign country, resembling a Jim Morrison clone.  Brad.  Everyone is in love with his Tristan character.  Must be the horrible smell.  I love guys who stink and don't display any personal hygiene myself, but it's even better when they abuse animals and cause misery everywhere they go.  They cry and they die in droves.

B003VANOFY|4.0|Pros- wireless is always a plus, long battery life, overall good sound crazy bass, nice surround sound. Nice construction, built to last as long as you take care of them.  Cons- software not that great. If you run 64bit be prepared to have problems seems to run ok with 32bit. You will hear static/popping from time to time not a huge problem but shouldn't be there at all.  Overall good product  I just wish they would update their software and tweak out some of the bugs

B0054N73EY|4.0|You already have your opinion.  I won't try to change it or to argue mine's better than yours.  To me, the collection of reviews of this record here on Amazon is a conversation among fans about the Chili Peppers.  I'm just joining the conversation, is all.<br /><br />\\"I'm with you\\" is a good album for sure.  The individuals involved are among the most talented in the industry, Anthony's vocals sound great, Flea and Chad are amazing, Josh adds some nice textures and background vocals, and there are some catchy, poppy tunes like Rain Dance Maggie and Look Around.  I'm less than crazy about it, though.  I find the tracks more polished but less edgy, and I love that edge that was so present in older Chili Peppers.  The albums from Mothers Milk through Stadium Arcadium varied in their edge factor, but all of them in my humble opinion are edgier than I'm with you, which to me takes fewer chances and sounds more commercial.  It also has less hard funk-rock and sounds more disco-y on some tracks.<br /><br />The other issue for me is the whole Josh/John thing.  I've enjoyed reading many of your comments about this, even those with whom I disagree.  For what it's worth, here's mine:<br /><br />The peppers with John had amazing chemistry, especially in the quietly brilliant presence of Rick Rubin.  While each of the four band members is a master in his own right, the combination of these four individuals created a magical synergy and energy that you rarely see in music anymore.<br /><br />With Josh instead of John, there's still some chemistry.  But less, and less magic.  For me, most of the chemistry I hear now is between Flea and Chad.  Josh adds textures and colors and layers, but he's not essential.  I don't like that he uses effects pedals so heavily rather than letting the raw guitar sound shine through.  His solos on the record are flat in comparison with John's solos on previous CP albums.  I'm sure Josh is better live, and I'll definitely be seeing the peppers at least once on their new tour.<br /><br />Whether we love it or not, the fact is that we have Josh now, not John.  I'll do my best to learn to love this new configuration of the chili peppers.  But so far, I'm not feeling the magic.<br /><br />If you are, I'm happy for you.her we love it or not, the fact is that we have Josh now, not John.  I'll do my best to learn to love this new configuration of the chili peppers.  But so far, I'm not feeling the magic.    If you are, I'm happy for you.
B001GZ6QEC|3.0|I absolutely love this movie. I hate paying $25 for blu ray discs though as even with my top notch equipment it's just not that much better. I already have two versions of the dvd.. yeah i like it that much and wanted the blu ray basically cause the price was right. However i was disappointed as when i got it there was a golf ball type divet in the blu ray which wouldn't allow it to play. I unfortunately had to return it. I am giving this item a 3 star for midway though because i received fast service and it was extremely easy to return at no cost to me.  So yes quality control sucked that this got out as it clearly couldn't play for anyone but Amazon customer service support was top notch for returns.
B005G4TJI4|4.0|A pure joy to watch with its many special effects. It is a true master piece that will keep you on the  edge of your seat.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|Who doesn't love the transformers. Picked this thing up primarily to save a few bucks, luckily blu ray is going down in price although i didn't need the two disc version and would rather have a cheaper straight blu ray i can appreciate it as i just gave the other away to a friend. works great, came as described. thank you!
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Compré con un poco de miedo por ser mi primera vez, pero no tuve ningún problema y ahora las estoy disfrutando, las películas se ven fantásticas...!!!
B003KUSUG8|5.0|I dislike paying $18 dollars a cd when I know that i can burn them.. illegal call it what you will. I just never bother burning them as eventually i find something new on the radio. Eminem has had issues here around Detroit but we all like to support local and his newest cd is by far one of his best since his debut. This cd was priced right, packaged great and looks and works like new! Thank you.
1594744769|4.0|This book nearly defies categorization. It's for young adults, but any adult should find this a fun read. It's historical fiction...sort of. There's definitely a fantasy and science fiction aspect. But it's really neither of those.  Without a doubt, however, this is one of the most creative and \\"cool\\" books I've read in a while. Author Riggs has compiled numerous old photographs, like the image on the cover, that he writes were found among the collections of several different individuals. He's built an entire world around those images. As the title hints, there's a school (a home really) for children with peculiar abilities. The plot focuses on a modern boy who not only battles his own teenage angst, but also the mystery of the life and death of his grandfather. I find it hard to write much more of the plot without giving away some of the fun discoveries that make the book so delightful.  The writing is crisp. Riggs builds a world with back stories and character-development that ties into each of the dozens of haunting, odd, and sometimes creepy photos throughout the book. The world that he's created, and the conclusion he leaves you with, are ripe for a sequel which he's confirmed is already in the works.   I recommend this book for anyone ages 6 and up. There are some grittier aspects to the story which might be tough for more sensitive children. But the book is clean. Its scares are quite limited. And I simply can't help but compare this to Harry Potter.
B002ZG99A4|5.0|So i hear there is a second movie in the works and that's great. It's a guys movie and I loved it, came as promised and works perfect. couldn't be happier. thank you.
B005LJITS0|5.0|Okay not sure why this movie only has 3 out of five stars at this time. It was a great movie!
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I skipped seeing this at the theaters - I thought i would be a waste of time.  Then I saw on one of those 5\\" seat-back screens on a flight to Denver. I was really surprised. The special effects, as expected, were amazing. The background of cap and his character development really added to the plot.  The Red Skull? Again, the movie pulled it off.<br /><br />People that give this movie 1 or 2 stars don't get it.  Some parts are supposed to be cheesy and over the top! Tying in Iron Man's dad and all the little tidbits that are planted throughout the movie also help build the background for th Avengers. Although I still think \\"Thor\\" was the worst movie in decades, there's even a major tie-in to Odin.<br /><br />This is a fun romp, does not take itself too seriously, and draws simple lines between good and evil.  The Red Skull is such a baddie, even the SS fears him! Cap is more American than the Man of Steel. Both owe their strength and powers to the same scientist, and even if they are not biologically related, they have a common genesis and \\"father.\\"<br /><br />This really is a must see for action hero fans!
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|I love this book! It is like Twilight mixed with Harry Potter, with a touch of Michael Crichton.  But for grown-ups.  I enjoyed that the plot revolved around history and relationships between characters, rather than oh isn't the vampire so pretty, he sparkles... oooh everything is magic and makes no sense.  It has just enough history to be logical, just enough romance to be sweet, and just enough supernatural to be unique.  It was long I suppose, but I savored it and wish it was longer.  Kudos to the author, don't listen to the idiots who say it isn't enough of this or that. As a reader who has read most available books, I can say it is thoughtful and perfectly unique.  PS, I'm very impatiently waiting on book two.  Have read this three times already.  Please hurry!
B000NH7SZ0|5.0|Wow!  I am taken back by how fast my HP CP1525nw printer now prints.  No more lag time as before the memory upgrade.  Amazon's $10 price cannot be beat. Kingston is ALWAYS high quality memory.<br /><br />Installation is easy and config (on a Mac) was as simple as opening System Prefs -> Print & Fax -> Options & Supplies -> Drivers -> pulling down the tab from 128MB to 256 MB.  It might be a bit confusing since you are adding 256 MB to the existing 128 MB, but your system realizes this and will utilize 324.17 MB of the 384 MB installed.<br /><br />You don't have to be a tekkie to have a faster printer.  This was easy and results are significant.  Highly recommended upgrade.<br />(P.S. - HP sends you to websites where you will pay $299 for the SAME memory!
B005KJZDXK|1.0|Does the world need yet another mediocre, dull, boring cover record of holiday songs? NO!  This is another case of having a product available for sale in a set time frame. Nothing original in any way. It's a lifeless attempt of regurgitating holiday songs. Nothing on here has any stamp of remaking anything with any new and exuberant spin.   My advice buy the original definitive versions by the original artists you associate the songs with. You'll have a much happier holiday. You certainly DON'T need this junk.
0894803123|4.0|I just received this book and have not had the chance to make any of the recipes, but everything sounds delicious and I know I will get around to trying out most of them.  This book was purchased in conjunction with the Cuisinart ICE-30BC Pure Indulgence 2-Quart Automatic Frozen Yogurt, Sorbet, and Ice Cream Maker, which I really like.
B005CM9DX6|3.0|First off - to everyone who compares this album to Damnation, you couldn't be further off base. There are no growling vocals on either of the albums - and that's where the comparison starts and ends. Damnation was a dark, disturbing, metal masterpiece. The soft acoustic guitars, ethereal keyboards, gut wrenching solos, and melancholic vocals could never fool you into believing that it wasn't a metal band behind the music.  Heritage, as the name suggests, pays homage to Mikael Akerfeldt's musical tradition, and everything and everyone that made him the musician he is today. There is some great musicianship on the album, and hints of moments that flirt with that unmistakable Opeth sound. However, I have two main gripes with this album:  - A lot of the tracks don't seem to flow organically. There's a \\"start-stop\\" feel to many of them. Good musical progressions and innovative chord sequences, but stitched together in a way that doesn't seem right.   - Mikael's vocals. I never knew the day would come when I'd have to say that his vocals didn't do much for me. And it has nothing to do with the fact that there are no growls (didn't I say that Damnation was a masterpiece?). It seems very tired and jaded. Take a song like \\"The Lines in My Hand\\" - this is actually some damn fine music, but his vocals just seem off, especially the bit around the 3:00 minute mark. There are several such moments on the album where he sounds (to me) like he's struggling. Another example is the Dio tribute \\"Slither\\". I can close my eyes and picture the late, great Ronnie belting out the same lyrics like a banshee even at 60. Sadly, Akerfeldt's vocals on that don't convey that Dio-esque power and soul.   Aside from those issues, the fact that the whole album doesn't fit in with the Opeth sound does play on my mind. It's all fine and dandy to try something new. But there's a reason you love a certain band - and it has a lot to do with the signature sound they've developed. Porcupine Tree being a prime example - they've changed directions a fair bit over their last few albums, with unfailing integrity towards that Porcupine Tree sound. But with this Opeth release, I feel like a lot of the Opeth sound has been lost, and the trade-off with this \\"new\\" direction doesn't make it feel worth it. I'm also afraid that we may have heard the last Opeth growl with Watershed.  Musically, there are some brilliant moments - my favorites include the stark, haunting opening piano title track, the music sans vocals on \\"The Lines in My Hand\\", \\"Folklore\\", \\"Marrow of the Earth\\" and the bonus track \\"Pyre\\".   As I said before, I'm conflicted about this album. But all things considered, I have to say I'm not a huge fan, somewhat disappointed, and I just about like it enough to give it 3 stars.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I have received the item purchased in perfect conditions and also within the delivery period stabilished. I would buy again and I would tell others to do the same.
B005HS00NW|5.0|Headphones were invented for sonic experiences like this cosmic voyage from M83 - the aptly named \\"Hurry Up, We're Dreaming.\\"  For the uninitiated, M83 is essentially a one-man act - that is, French multi-instrumentalist Anthony Gonzalez.  He does work with frequent collaborators, however.  While starting out as a spacey electronica outfit, M83 is firmly entrenched now in the dream pop genre.  \\"Hurry Up, We're Dreaming\\" is a two-disc album that focuses on how dreams vary depending on one's age.  This subject matter is ideal for an artist who is fond of enigmatic lyrics and wondrous aural vistas.  Admittedly, Gonzalez adores the big production style that defined the 80's, but there is nothing excessive in his methods here.  His approach is simply necessary to achieve the epic technicolor vision of his trip through subconscious bliss.  For the band that gave the world the ultimate dream pop song with \\"Kim & Jessie\\" from 2008's \\"Saturdays = Youth,\\" it's no surprise this effort failed to top that benchmark; however, that matters little since this album is wall to wall with great tunes.  While his fifth album was a disappointment overall, this outstanding record reclaims the glory of the 2005 masterpiece, \\"Before The Dawn Heals Us.\\"  \\"Hurry Up, We're Dreaming\\" is pivotal for Gonzalez as he has embraced his singing voice.  He sounds like Eric Woolfson of The Alan Parsons Project in spots and Chad Petree of Shiny Toy Guns in others.  Up to this point, M83's music has been mostly instrumentals.  With all the hushed vocals of his previous work, it's rewarding to hear Gonzalez step out and sing so well.  Furthermore, he employs his voice imaginatively on songs like \\"Claudia Lewis,\\" \\"OK Pal\\" and \\"Steve McQueen\\" where some may mistake the sounds as a synthesizer.  The album is the sum of lessons learned from just over a decade in the biz and the result is spectacular.  This instant classic slides gracefully between liquid ambient pieces and continent shifting epic pop.  Also, Gonzalez is willing to indulge his playful side on songs like \\"Raconte-Moi Une Histoire\\" where a little girl tells the story of what happens if one touches this special frog from a distant land.  Such sweet eccentricities make for sublime lullabies.  The double album format is ideal for exploration, which M83 take full advantage of.  For example, the 'spooky laughing clown' choir drives \\"Midnight City,\\" while \\"Year One, One UFO\\" lands in the middle of a Spanish fiesta.  The bottom line - \\"Hurry Up, We're Dreaming\\" is beautiful, awe-inspiring and adventurous.  Indeed, it is one of the best albums of 2011.  Highlights are: \\"Reunion,\\" \\"Wait,\\" \\"New Map,\\" \\"Year One, One UFO\\" and \\"Steve McQueen.\\"  [A final thought - there are complaints that the music here could've fit on one disc for this album.  That is a fact.  The Flaming Lips' double-LP \\"Embryonic\\" was released all on one disc, so this has been done by other artists.  However, Gonzalez, being the nostalgic type, wanted to release a true double-album while physical compact discs are still being made.  This information was related by the musician in a recent interview I viewed on YouTube.  By the way, The Clash's \\"London Calling\\" could've fit on one disc as well - think about it.  Would we want that to be a one disc album?  That said, either way (one disc or two) - this in no way diminishes my enjoyment of this record or other double albums that I own.]  {NOTE: In order to get the bonus song \\"Mirror,\\" retrieve the code (which should be 32 digits I believe) from the inside sleeve of the CD where the album notes are contained.  The CD case itself, not the liner booklet.  The code is very hard to see and one will want to hold the CD up to a bright light to see it.  Be aware that the code is made up of numbers, except what may look like 1's are actually I's.  I had to use a combination of both on mine for whatever that's worth.  Another hint is that the last 16 digits of the code are the opposite of the first 16 digits (like a mirror's reflection).  Well, that was my experience at any rate.  Once you locate the code, go to M83's main website and find the link on how to get that bonus track.  Follow the instructions from there.  Note the website will send you an email once you have gone through all the steps - the email contains a special link where you will be able to download the free track \\"Mirror\\" (which is in the vein of the 2008 song \\"Couleurs\\").}

B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Great tale of intrigue, abnormal behaviors, abuse, learning differences, survival, and adaptability.

B004HW7JMO|5.0|In truth I don't know what I can say that hasn't been said already.  I went into the story sad that my favorite character/actor wouldn't be in it, but the story line quickly drew me in.  Characters that were previously just empty villains were fleshed out and their points of view were fully explained, making them real people and creating a depth to the story that added immensely to the overall series.  If you enjoyed Season One, trust that Gods of the Arena will not disappoint.
B005IZLPKQ|4.0|This long awaited film had been in development hell since 1997 which included lawsuit delays and a recent strike by the Writer's Guild of America. Chris Evans does a commendable job of playing the humble, heroic lad who will be turned into Captain America. Stanley Tucci gets one of the best speeches even though his time in the picture is limited. Hayley Atwell is one of the better love interests of the various Marvel movies. Hugo Weaving is under used. The reference to MI6 was in correct as they were known as the SIS during WWII. Small nitpicking there, I admit.<br /><br />There's a good deal of pulpy action and overall the story is good even if not great nor superlative. This film cost $140M to make and yielded a tad over $365M at the box office. A sequel is expected but THE AVENGERS (which will appear many of the Marvel Heroes) is going to be released beforehand. Critics were generally positive about this film. This picture was nominated for a number of awards and the 2011 Scream Awards gave it Best Superhero. As usual watch the credits to see a sneak peek at a future Avengers film.<br /><br />WHEN WATCHED: October 2011; STORY/PLOTTING: B; CHARACTERS/DIALOGUE: B plus to A minus; IDEALS: B; ACTION SCENES: B; OVERALL GRADE: B to B plus.<br /><br />BEST DIALOGUE (possible spoilers): Timothy 'Dum Dum' Dugan: Are you sure you know what you're doing? Steve Rogers: Yeah. I punched out Adolf Hitler 200 times. ///[flipping through Steve's file] Dr. Abraham Erskine: Where are you from Mr. Rogers?  Mmm? Is it New Haven? Or Paramus? Five exams in five different cities. Steve Rogers: That might not be the right file. Dr. Abraham Erskine: No, it's not the exams I'm interested in. It's the five tries. But you didn't answer my question. Do you want to kill Nazis? Steve Rogers: Is this a test? Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yes. Steve Rogers: I don't wanna kill anyone. I don't like bullies. I don't care where they're from. Well, there are already so many big men fighting this war. Maybe what we need now is the little guy, huh? /// [to Steve] Dr. Abraham Erskine: So many people forget that the first country that the Nazi's invaded was their own. You know, after the last war the...my people struggled. They...they felt weak. They felt small. And then Hitler comes along with the marching and the big show and the flags and the...and the... [he waves his hand] Dr. Abraham Erskine: And he...he hears of me, my work and he finds me. And he says, you...he says you will us strong. Well, I am not interested. So he sends the head of Hydra, his research division. A brilliant scientist by the name of Johann Schmidt. Now, Schmidt is a member of the inner circle and he's ambitious. He and Hitler share a passion for a cult power and Teutonic myth. Hitler uses his fantasies to inspire his followers. But for Schmidt it is not fantasy. For him, it is real. He has become convinced that there is a great power in the earth, left there by the Gods, waiting to be seized by a superior man. So when he hears about my formula and what it can do, he cannot resist. [flashback of how Schmidt takes Erskine's formula and injects himself with it] Dr. Abraham Erskine: Schmidt must become that superior man. Steve Rogers: Did it make him stronger? Dr. Abraham Erskine: Yeah. But, there were other effects. The serum was not ready. But more important, the man. The serum amplifies everything that is inside. So, good becomes great. Bad becomes worse. This is why you were chosen. Because a strong man, who has known power all his life, will lose respect for that power. But a weak man knows the value of strength. And knows compassion. Steve Rogers: Thanks. I think.
B000002G8N|5.0|Eric Clapton's best album in my opinion is his 8th studio album \\"Another Ticket\\" , #7 in 1981.  This album has been put back so farrrrr in Clapton's catalog, you really have to dig hard for it).  I fell in love with this one back in college at Fort Hays State.  It starts out the blues guitar and piano piece \\"Something Special\\", then you get the acoustic \\"Black Rose\\", \\"Blow Wind Blow\\" #24 mainstream rock,great cover of the Muddy Waters tune.  Then comes the beautiful \\"Another Ticket\\" #78 hot 100, the big hit \\"I Can't Stand It\\" #10 hot 100 and #1 mainstream rock (You never hear this song anymore around here).  \\"Hold Me Lord\\", is a great track!  The pure blues of Sleepy John Estes \\"Floating Bridge\\" and it ends with 2 rocking' tracks \\"Catch Me If You Can\\" #23 mainstream rock with help from Procol Harum's Gary Brooker and \\"Rita Mae\\" #18 Mainstream Rock, with  one smoking' hot Clapton solo.  Only 9 songs, but this Eric at his best here!  Eric was one sick man when he released this, it's amazing after all he went through, he's still doing this 30 years later.

Cale number \\"Cocaine\\",  the ultimate lush-pop \\"Wonderful Tonight\\" #16, \\"Lay Down Sally\\", a song that came on all the time in shop class back in high school, #16 hot 100 and # 26 country,  and pure classic Clapton with great guitar on \\"The Core\\", this song had wonderful vocals by Yvonne Elliman of \\"If I Can't Have You\\" fame.  Other top songs are the bouncy number \\"May You Never\\" and the blues remake of \\"Mean Old Frisco\\".  Good stuff here, my 2nd favorite Eric Clapton album.

B005VW4Q70|4.0|Given the worldwide success of the Shrek franchise, it was only a matter of time before we started seeing spinoffs, and so it comes as no surprise that the fall of 2011 sees the release of Puss in Boots. The feline lover-and-fighter quickly became an enormously popularly character following his initial appearance in Shrek 2, with his swashbuckling ways, his flirtatious voice (provided by Antonio Banderas), and his secret weapon - big, adorable eyes which turn grown men to jelly - and this new movie focuses solely on him. Directed by Chris Miller, the film again features Banderas as the leading voice, and is a prequel of sorts, telling the story of the events leading up to Puss's introduction to Shrek and Donkey, from Puss's point of view. The cast features the voices of Salma Hayek as Puss's paramour Kitty Softpaws, Zach Galifianakis as Humpty Dumpty, Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris as Jack and Jill, and even Guillermo Del Toro as the mysterious Moustache Man.  Taking over from Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell on musical duties is another of Hans Zimmer's Remote Control alumni, English composer Henry Jackman, who has already attracted a great deal of positive attention for himself following his generally very good work on the likes of Monsters vs. Aliens, Gulliver's Travels, and two other scores from earlier this year, X-Men First Class and the new Winnie the Pooh movie. As good as those scores were, Puss in Boots is clearly his best work to date. Taking his cues from several film music contemporaries as well classical composers Manuel de Falla and Maurice Ravel (whose Bolero is probably the epitome of Spanish classical music), Jackman's score is a wonderfully entertaining, high energy action-adventure score, topped with an appropriately healthy dose of Latin fire.  The first thing long-time film music fans will notice is how much of a similarity there is between this score and James Horner's Zorro scores, The Mask of Zorro and The Legend of Zorro. This isclearly intentional - temp track bleed-through at worst, loving homage at best - but is also wholly appropriate in a sort of neo-satirical way, acknowledging the fact that Banderas plays both Zorro and Puss, and that Puss is clearly a Zorro clone. This sense of tongue in cheek self-awareness runs through the entire film - and the entire Shrek series, really - and helps dispel the notion of the score being a \\"Zorro rip-off\\" and nothing more.  Written for a large orchestra with emphasis on strings and brass, as well as a vast array of Spanish and Mexican specialty instruments and percussion items, Jackman's score starts out with the energy turned up fully, and rarely lets up throughout the score's 66-minute running time. Upon hearing the opening cue, \\"A Bad Kitty\\", with its flashing guitars, flamenco-style hand claps and foot stomps, trembling castanets, resounding trumpet calls, and swirling string writing, you know what kind of experience the score has in store.  The main theme - a heroic fanfare with a romantic and passionate flourish - first appears in this cue, and is prominent throughout the rest of the score, appearing in many guises, and being played in numerous different instrumental combinations. The B-phrase of the theme is the one most clearly inspired by Horner, and generally tends to appear at moments of great emotion or pathos, where it plays as a recurring motif for Puss's heroism and gallantry, in cues such as the outstanding \\"Honor and Justice\\", the stirring \\"Confronting the Past\\", and the big finale in \\"The Great Terror\\" - the latter of which even manages to make use of Horner's favorite tension-builder, the shakuhachi bamboo flute.  The theme is especially adept at appearing in action settings, but has a mischievous edge to it in cues such as the playfully seductive pair of \\"Kitty Softpaws\\" and \\"Kitty-Cat Break-Out\\", and even a more pathos-laden stripped-down flavor in \\"Team Effort\\". In the flashback sequence of \\"The Orphanage\\", it runs through a variety of different guises as Puss recollects his kittenhood, and his first steps on the road to fame as a swordfighter, prior to him finally receiving the boots that will become his trademark; the variety of orchestral color and inventiveness in this cue, and the gamut of emotions Jackman squeezes into just over four minutes, is impressive indeed.  The action music, which first appears in \\"Chasing Tail\\" but features much more prominently in the score's second half, generally tends to be big, bold and lively, with strong rhythmic elements and a genuine sense of drama and adventure. Cues such as \\"That Fateful Night\\", the stirring \\"The Wagon Chase\\", \\"The Magic Beanstalk\\", the enormous \\"Golden Goose of Legend\\", and the aforementioned \\"The Great Terror\\" could have successfully appeared in any serious live-action western without much alteration. Similarly, the surprisingly dark \\"I Was Always There\\" uses the guitars and accordions in a different way altogether, ramping up the tension levels, before building up into a tragedy-laded and unexpectedly emotional finale.  The haunting trumpet calls, whistles, electric guitars and harmonicas of \\"One Leche\\" are excellent pastiches of vintage spaghetti western-era Ennio Morricone, and similar ideas carry through the likes of \\"Holy Frijoles\\" and parts of \\"Confronting the Past\\". Similarly, the very brief \\"Jack and Jill\\" has flavors of Hans Zimmer's `hallucinating Jack Sparrow' music from the third Pirates of the Caribbean movie, although this is just a passing nod and a wink. There is also a twinkling, magical motif for the Jack and the Beanstalk sequence that reaches its zenith in \\"Castle in the Clouds\\" and the first half of the aforementioned \\"Golden Goose of Legend\\", where the soaring central melody tends to be accompanied by all manner of chimes, cooing choirs, and celestial superfluities. In a way, it's a shame that the Jack and the Beanstalk motif is destined to overshadowed by the Latin flair of the Puss theme, because it's good enough to be a main theme in its own right, and is likely to be forgotten amongst all the panache elsewhere.  In addition to his own work, Jackman also collaborated with the Mexican guitar duo Rodrigo Sánchez and Gabriela Quintero, collectively known as Rodrigo y Gabriela, whose contributions to Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides earlier this year were strangely muted, but who are on top form here. Their two showpiece cues, \\"Diablo Rojo\\" and \\"Hanuman\\", are simply sensational; the speed and precision of their performances are nothing short of breathtaking. This is exactly the stuff I wanted to hear from them in Pirates of the Caribbean and didn't get, but fans of their work will absolutely love what they have brought to this project.  The album finishes with \\"The Puss Suite\\" - a superb and highly enjoyable remix of the main theme underpinned by a more contemporary electronic beat and enlivened by a Crimson Tide-style male voice choir and an occasional \\"olé!\\" befitting Ricky Martin or Enrique Iglesias - and \\"The Giant's Castle\\", a restatement of the fairytale Jack and the Beanstalk theme which ends the score with an appropriately magical tone.  Despite my protestations to the contrary and my assertations that it's an intentional homage, I suspect that many people will have issues with how similar Jackman's theme is to Horner's Zorro scores, and that it will result in many people decrying Puss in Boots as nothing more than a poor imitation. For me, however, to do so would be a huge injustice and a slap in the face to Jackman and all the work he has put into this score. The orchestral inventiveness, the fantastic use of the guitars and other Spanish specialty instruments, the outstanding Jack and the Beanstalk theme, and the show-stopping contributions of Rodrigo y Gabriela combine to make Puss in Boots one of the most unexpectedly engaging and entertaining score of the year, and confirms my earlier thought that Henry Jackman is poised to follow in the footsteps of Harry Gregson-Williams and John Powell as possibly the most talented composer to emerge from Remote Control for many years.

0061914177|3.0|Long story short, a lot of Gary's lessons I already knew.  I got about half way though hoping that something new would come up.  I eventually gave up.  It's good to drive home values I've learned before, but really I did not get too much value out of this.  Being a 20-something year old working in the tech and entertainment industry, I derived little value from this book. I live and breathe this everyday and it's my job to be the cutting edge of media trends.  I wouldn't say this book is obsolete, it definitely hits the foundation of everything you need to know about social media and growing a personal brand.  Gary did indeed do well for himself, and has got a lot of personality.  It's good that he's spent the time to get this book done and pass on the wisdom.  But again, for me it was nothing new...which is what I was hoping for, due to the astounding reviews.  I'd say as a simple rule if you use klout or know what it is, chances are don't need this book.  If you don't know what klout is, than this book is probably worth looking into!

Happy with it; no plans to change or \\"develop the other half of myself.\\" (A psychologist friend tells me Jung intended the system to help you know what you needed to work on.  After reading Quiet, the thought flashed across my mind:  Jung's dead.  Maybe he would have changed his thinking about needing to work on my weak side if he'd lived long enough.)<br /><br />I was encouraged to open a bio of Dale Carnegie after reading Quiet, and I think Cain does him a bit of a disservice.  Yes, he's the key to the cult of personality.  OTOH, he's also the reason we learned how to teach public speaking in a way that worked.  I'm a fluent and skilled public speaker as a result of that course.  Carnegie's system works.  There's no contradiction between introversion and acquisition of a skill like public speaking.<br /><br />Funny, but while I'll defend Dale, I loved the rip on Harvard Business School.<br /><br />A few other quibbles from a note I made while reading:<br />>the habit of referring to content addressed in future chapters quickly became irritating.<br />>In the Collaboration / Creativity chapter, Cain dismisses those musicians training to be music teachers at the \\"elite Music Academy in West Berlin\\" as \\"the worst group.\\"  Huh?

I couldn't finish that book.  My creativity is a solo thing.

0802798233|5.0|When I first saw the cover of this book. I knew I had to read it. After reading books that pretty much sounded the same. I read perfect chemistry by Simone Elkeles and was instantly hooked. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFE a book grabbed me and wouldn't let go. I completed this book in a matter of a few hours and thirsted for more. I was so intrigued by Alex and Brittany and I absolutely despised some of the characters that were threatening Brittany and Alex's love. This book is one you have to get for your collection. I am a firm believer that if you like a book and you know your going to read it again and again. Then buy this book. And keep it. But if you don't like it and its just a one time read. Then don't. This book is a book I will read again and again. I love the representation of the Diversity and the culture. I love how well put this story is. The chapters are not too long and not too short and it goes from different perspectives. Alex then Brittany and so on and so forth. This book is amazing. And ive only said that about one other book and thats the bible. I've read Simone other books. But this one astounds me. Read this book. It will warm your heart, make you want to read more, and there is more! by the way. [see: rules of attraction and chain reaction] and make you want to pick it up again and again. If there is going to be a movie. It better be exactly like the book and it better have some good stuff to it. Because this book is amazing. I can't say that enough about this book.

B004XANKVO|5.0|I bought this to replace an older 2400 cubic inch backpack. Although this pack is smaller, its superior space utilization makes it feel like it's even larger than it is! I can carry my laptop, my lunch, a liter thermos, workout clothes and a pair of running shoes and there is still room for more! It's casual enough to carry around in everyday use but its looks are also appropriate for presentations or conferences. Good build quality. I love the jacket stuff pocket in the front: I keep a windbreaker and a travel umbrella in it and I have not had any trouble with them falling out. Expensive but worth it.

B005J4TLN4|5.0|Break out the Chip, Dip and Beverages. Joe Cornish in his debut film on a fraction of the budget manages to pull off something that Steven Spielberg and JJ Abrams couldn't do with all their millions on Super 8; make a really good fun movie that you can enjoy watching over and over again.
B003ZSJ212|3.0|I really enjoy all the extras on the blu-ray.  I don't really care about the small canges to the movies, it doesn't change the story, although I could live without the \\"No!\\".  The only thing I'm really dissapointed in is that the horrible blue tent is still on the originals from the DVD release-I read somehere they fixed that,  they didn't.  I'm all for changing things up, I just wish they would make more of an effort to make sure the change is for the better.  But these people who have gone from loving Star Wars to hating it-if you don't like an altered version of Star Wars then simply don't watch it.     I recently saw the Adywan Star Wars edit-    <...>    and was very impressed. It's literally a perfect example of what a tweaked Star Wars movie should be. Every change made the movie better, made a movie I've seen a hundred times new again.      With the 3D versions approaching Lucasfilm has yet another chance to get it right.  May the force be with them.

0810994739|4.0|Review of \\"The Diary of a Wimpy Kid\\" on October 28, 2011  \\"Not only is Greg a wimp, he also has the worst luck.\\"  Jeff Kinney is the talented cartoonist and author for this book. He is well known for both his \\"Diary of a Wimpy kid\\" books and his kid website \\"Poptropica\\". The book I am reviewing is a Realistic Fiction and Comedy. The book not only made me laugh, but was quite interesting. The challenges and obstacles he goes through, are just hysterical. It inversely helps people see how a middle child could feel.   Greg is the main character. He is the middle child of his family. His big brother is more of a tease to him and embarrasses. Also a lot of bribery goes in this story between the two of them. His parents are very oblivious and embarrassing to him as well. He and his friends are looked as the \\"nerds\\" in school, making them \\"wimpy\\". Throughout the story, I laughed and found it to be an enjoyment. It is very entertaining and interesting. I agree with the way the author proved his point in this novel. This book helped me understand those with bad luck and with unusual families. Read it and you wouldn't regret it.

0451197968|5.0|It wasn't until I picked this book up last week at a book sale that I realized I had seen the movie and not actually read the story. I can tell you that although both are worth your time the two are not that much alike.<br /><br />The book THE RUNNING MAN takes us into a time that is not too far away from where we are now. People glorify in what they see as justice being carried lived on tv, and the reward is great not only for those playing the game of the law but those who are bringing it to us as well.<br /><br />With Ben Richards, a man who finds himself accused of crimes he didn't commit, there is a choice to be made: will you just accept the fate layed out for you or will you fight for your innocence and your name being cleared regardless what the cost? Looking at where we are not in society where death is glorified and the gory stories are the more we want to see, King showcases the path of humanity and where we are headed if we don't start rethinking what we see as entertainment and the difference between what is right and right.<br /><br />To say that this book was prophetic of some of the reality shows we see today is an understatement. The great thing about King is that he delivers an entertaining read while allowing us to see that not all endings are happy but they can be just.<br /><br />If you are looking for the storybook ending that was delivered on the big screen then you might be disappointed, but this will still be a book that will make it one of your favorite that King has delivered...and that says alot.

B003G4W49C|2.0|As other reviewers have said, if you are 12 years old you might like it. I love scifi and anything space related, and I have published 3 novels (so I am loathe to rip on any writer's effort) but this book is really not good. It is the Winnie the Pooh of scifi. The training the \\"soldiers\\" undergo is so simplistic it's borderline idiotic (I mention this because it's the central theme of the book), the dialogs and reactions of the main characters are forced and stiff, the ending so completely predictable ... Do yourself a favor and go for adult reading, Richard Morgan or China Mielville or, hell, anyone else.

B004EPZ0BG|5.0|When I saw this movie I knew from the beginning I knew it was gonna be a chick flick/romance comedy and while most of them are pretty predictable this one was really good. In the beginning I gotta say they did a great job at seeling NYC and all it has to offer. I was in Dubai watching the film thinking \\"man I miss New York\\". I am originally from New York, thats why I say that. This movie was hilarious but now I have to buy the DVD because I want to see the parts that were censored out in the Dubai theater. Anyone thats ever lived in the middle east knows what Im talking about. And I just had to see it cause Mila Kunis so gorgeous. JT, not the best actor but he still did a good job. Did I menion, Mila Kunis is hot. It was great seeing Woody Harrelson back on the big screen. He played that gay role very well. Overall it was a great movie, one that I definitely recommend buying or at least seeing

B0053YGYO4|5.0|I will be doing a track-by-track review, but if you must know the verdict, the album is great. It's not their masterpiece, but it's cohesiveness and beauty really shine. There's not a single track that doesn't get stuck in my head after listening to it. Great LP.   1. Mylo Xyloto: This track is just a short 42-second introduction, distorted guitars, xylophone tingling, and electronic droplets of some kind, maybe even a mandolin, it's a nice smooth transition into Hurts Like Heaven.  2. Hurts Like Heaven: The template for the Mylo Xyloto world. Taking the streets, battling with love, graffiti spraying galore, \\"concrete convas\\", \\"Spray Can Soul\\". It's a little heavy on the autotune backing, but it kinda fits nicely in, like a sorta face-paced Bon Iver rock song. Jonny's guitars sound just as good as they did live. Pounding drums and a beautiful outro makes this song complete, great opener, I'm glad they went with it. 9/10  3. Paradise: Everyone has heard about this song. Coldplay in elephant suits. Orchestral intro to RnB drums and huge bass, Chris Martin's vocals are actually quite prestine, starting the story of Mylo Xyloto by introducing a girl lost within a world of her own dreams. The para-para-paradise will glue into your mind. The piano is beautiful. This song, without context to the album, didn't stun me, but here, right after Hurts Like Heaven, just feels so right. Not to mention I'm a sucker for group chants. 8.5/10  4. Charlie Brown: If their is a masterpiece to come out of this album, it's this song. It's so. So. So absorbing. It takes you by the hand and sends you on a wild midnight ride down the streets of some fantasy world full of graffiti and glowsticks and fireworks. The guitar and kinda clackety keyboard are amazingly catchy. The boy character of the story has found himself meeting up with his love and going on an adventure \\"rioting\\" through the streets, \\"glowing in the dark\\". Not to mention the killer driving bassline and pressing time-signature changing drums and the whispering sped-up vocal intros/interludes. The piano outro surronded by hovering strings is beautiful. 10.5/10  5. Us Against the World: The introduction of this song is sets the mood so well. The lyrics are probably some of the best to come out of a Coldplay song, I won't spoil any, but it's quite poetic and lovely. Reminiscent of an older Coldplay it speaks straight to the heart, melding the geninue voice of Martin (which can sound off-kilter on some low notes, but it adds to the paintbrush like feeling) and the lovely voice of Will Champion. When the swell of Jonny's guitar and Guy's bass come in, it's like a wave of elegiacness, so sad, yet so gorgeous. 10/10  6. M.M.I.X.: It doesn't stand for anything, but it resembles the Eno synths and bird sounds coupled with atomspheric tinkering. It actually makes a transition from something so simple like Us Against the World into the synth-heavy, summery Every Teardrop a whole lot easier. And better.   7. Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall: You've heard this one too. Martin screams \\"You can hurt me bad, but I'll still raise the flag\\" like gathering the remnants of a rebellion. It really is a summer anthem and it will always find a way on to my playlists to cheer me up when I'm down. It's infectious, give it that. And it's ready and roaring to say anything to you it damn well pleases. \\"Every teardrop is a waterfall\\" doesn't refer to the anguish of life, but rather to the bursting-at-the-seams tears of joy that come when you've experienced catharsis. 9/10  8. Major Minus: The self proclaimed \\"baddie\\" by Chris Martin. The villian. The screamer. Okay not really the screamer, but the instrumentals are bold and an actual guitar solo comes from Buckland, and it's actually pretty good. I love the sirens and the \\"o-oh-oh\\"'s, they just are so powerful. It drives, the bassline is so good. So good. I just really love blasting this song when it comes on in the car, I feel like I have some huge fight I'm about to getin, but then... 9/10  9. U.F.O.: Refering to the \\"but let's fly, split the sky\\" lyric, U.F.O. is  an acoustic shiner. It's lyric prowess is simple but effective. After encountering the villian the couple decides to avoid trouble and head to the skies. The strings that come half-way through surrond Martin like a symphony helping guide them to a new world. It's a short one, and the last 10 or so seconds are a clickety-guitar transition, that helps make way for the actually villian. The break-up. 9.5/10  10. Princess of China: Garning power from a huge synthy-grind and a bass drum and bass guitar that lead the way it seems to me like it's much more the baddie. After avoiding the villian the couple now finds themselves seperated from what seems to be a dream to find a new world. Rihanna does make an appearence for most of the song, but it's tolerable, generally I don't like Rihanna, but Chris' low and Rihanna's highs are suitable with each other. I can feel this becoming a hit. I don't why. Maybe it's Rihanna. Or more likely, it's a great track, the guitar works great during Rihanna's verses and the outro just bleeds sing-a-long. 8.5/10  11. Up In Flames: You will have Chris Martin's falsetto \\"Up in flames\\" stuck in your head all day. It's painfully simple, and heart-achingly beautiful. It's a slow burner (punny) and it's momentenous moment never really comes. But the heartbeat like rhythm and the classic piano along with the almost country guitar near the end work awesome. \\"Can we pour some water on?\\", the line in which Martin truly finds himself wondering if she will ever come back, or if the fire will rage on forever. 9/10  12. A Hopeful Transmission: A short instrumental full of spoon clicking and symphonic strings, it's like the opener Mylo Xyloto but a little more beat-heavy. I think though, it's more than a instrumental, the title referring to Martin calling out to his lover once more. Or maybe him calling out to get rescued from himself and his dreams of \\"streets of gold (from U.F.O.)\\". The best instrumental on the album and a perfect intro to...  13. Don't Let It Break Your Heart: Like a ocean waves beating down on you this song comes at you full-force. Banging drums, intense bassline, a stunning guitar part, and a reverbed Chris Martin. This song gets me everytime, the chorus is the especially good, the best on the album. It's got super synths and pleasantly surprisingly good lyrics. I want this one to become a hit, it just sounds so ready to go and happy. Finally, even through all the despair and crushed dreams, Martin sees a light at the end of tunnel, and maybe his lover as he calls out to her, from his \\"shipwreck\\" that he got himself in to. The heartbeat is probably one of the best moments on the album. Stunning. 10/10  14. Up with the Birds: The first half containing a peaceful piano and moving strings and clicking-synths that intertwine so well with a deeper Chris Martin vocals. The transition with it's beautiful \\"uhh\\"s and spinning synths is only complimented by the electric guitar that comes in along with an acoustic partner. Some of Martin's best wordplay comes from the second half. During this track though, Martin goes from realizing that not everything is ever going to be perfect to knowing that \\"good things are coming our way\\". A happy ending to a great album. It speaks to the heart and its concept story is one that has been played out perfectly. 10/10  But not everything is super about this album. It's not their masterpiece, but it's close. A little over-production, a little dry spots. I would've like to seen an extended U.F.O., it just seemed so ready to lift off. This album though, in general, is wonderful. It doesn't push huge boundries persay, but it definitely perfects the ones it stays inside. Love it.  MX

B004Q9SO0O|3.0|This is an uneven collection.  About 30% of it is genuine first-class, grade-A, Five-star jazz records.  The remaining 70% ranges from \\"pretty good\\" to \\"highly mediocre\\" with several records that are interesting from a historical perspective but otherwise not worth repeated listening.  That said, the price is right and it filled some holes in my collection, I just wish it were better chosen.  If you're new to jazz, I'd caution against making sweeping generalizations based on this sample - a lot of it is second or third rate and it would be a shame if you were under the impression that this was the best jazz has to offer.  It's not.  Not by a long shot.  I really like the packaging which faithfully reproduces the original album covers in miniature - you'll need a magnifying glass to read the liner notes, but there's a booklet with the essential info in a type you can read.  The other thing they did right is to resist the urge to include a bunch of alternate takes (who wants to listen to the same tun 5 times in a row?) - for the most part the CDs are exactly the album as originally issued.
B005CM9DX6|3.0|Completely different work in comparison with their history. Opeth continue to present us a really creative music, but I missed their old style.
B0054N73EY|5.0|Klinghoffer is a fine addition to the group. His fingering is magical. As always, Anthony's lyrics are spot on and the added percussion to many of the pieces make for a more flavorful beat. And Flea's base is top form as usual. In short, this is another golden production from a most prolific group of highly talented guys. So when will they tour with this new music in the US. Understand they are in Europe with it now. Come home boys!!

B00000J2PH|5.0|If anyone has earned the right to cover the Shirelles and Aretha Franklin, it's this singer-songwriter who made these songs available for them in the first place. Her updated versions are as intelligent and unpretentious as they were always meant to be. The other songs lend themselves to this approach in her record-making. The purity of her voice, her straight-to-the-point piano playing plus the unintrusive backing musicians permit that soulfulness to come through on virtually every cut. It helps too that all the melodies are winners. Aside from a powerful outlaw anthem, \\"Smackwater Jack\\", the album offers variations on the themes of domestic or platonic relations.<br /><br />\\"So Far Away\\" exercises itself in self-doubt and yearning for a wandering lover. With its killer piano lick, \\"It's Too Late\\" is an amazing and eternal verity of breaking up long after the flaming embers have disintegrated. And in \\"You've Got a Friend\\", she makes a thoroughly convincing attempt as an unconditional comrade without the slightest hint of sappiness. This is the real her.

0316017930|5.0|Many books addressing achievement look only to the qualities of the individual. As important as attitude and determination tend to be, they rarely tell the whole story.  Malcolm Gladwell is an expert at digging deep into the full scope behind achievement and finding meaning and importance where others often overlook.  The result is an extensive study that uncovers many areas of intrigue that may have played large yet generally unseen roles.<br /><br />The premise of this book is perhpas defined best by a metaphor Gladwell provides early in the book:  \\"The tallest oak in the forest is the tallest not just because it grew from the hardiest acorn; it is the tallest also because no other trees blocked its sunlight, the soil around it was deep and rich, no rabbit chewed through its bark as a sapling, and no lumberjack cut it down before it matured.  We all know that successful people come from hardy seeds.  But do we know enough about the sunlight that warmed them, the soil in which they put down the roots, and the rabbits and lumberjacks they were lucky enough to avoid?\\"  The bulk of this book is thus spent analyzing those external influences that helped create some of the most colossal successes known to today and what you can learn from them.<br /><br />Some may find it hard to believe that some of the most famous successes known today, despite being briliant, driven, and skilled, were also very fortunate.  Gladwell doesn't discount the value of talent and in fact spends considerable analysis on the importance of repetition and the now famous 10,000 hour rule.  Yet the real impact of this book is centered on the notion that circusmtnaces are not just an equally important factor, but a surpsignly well tested theory.  Gladwell is not short on examples or history thus making his conclusions difficult to refute. His writing is equally as fluent thus making this an effortless and enjoyable book to read.  Anyone with an interest in the elements of achievement should have this book on their list.ist.
1932735410|3.0|I have read the 5th edition and like it but felt I should get the latest, so I got the seventh edition. Since I always compare things, I used this latest edition, and the PMBOK guide and another exam prep document. As I do simulation exams (everyday) I get certain questions wrong. EVERY time I check conflicting answers, the RMC seventh edition book is wrong when compare to my other 2 sources, and I mean WAY OFF.  Although the written structure is good, the content is not 100% correct. You are best off not using this 7th edition as your sole source. Your lower exam scores will be evident if you just use this book.
B004FQX5CK|5.0|after all this time that this movie has been out it is still awesome. they did a great job with the visuals and the cast is spot on as well. there inst too much of a difference between the final cut and the original release in my opinion. maybe the narration by ford, I like the graphics and sound upgrade from it being blu ray. and the price is reasonable. If you are a fan of blade runner or any syfi future type movies this is worth the purchase. I bought this one instead of the 5 disc one because the 5 disc was a bit pricy for all the different versions in one package. I was content with just this one as I have the 5 disc on DVD at home still.
0688172377|5.0|NOTE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS.   Desert Flower is the inspiring life story of Waris Dirie's transformation from Somali desert nomad to international supermodel.   The story begins with Waris' pastoralist childhood in the Somali desert, where she lives with her family. During this time, she is voluntarily circumcised, an event which greatly impacts the rest of her life. She eventually flees her desert life, when her father attempts to arrange an undesirable marriage. She lives with family in Mogadishu, before deciding to live with her uncle, an ambassador, in London.   For the next four years, Waris lives as a maid in  London, where she is spotted by a modeling scout. Unfortunately, she needs a passport and enters a sham marriage to acquire one. Her marriage becomes abusive, and she moves to New York to pursue her modeling career. She becomes the subject of a BBC documentary, allowing her to briefly re-unite with her mother. She meets her future husband and becomes a special ambassador for the UN, speaking out against female circumcision. Finally, she becomes pregnant, frees herself from the abusive marriage, and has her first child.   Dirie's memoir is fast-paced and easy to read. It explores the vast cultural divide between a Western international supermodel and a Somali desert nomad, while remaining relatable and understandable to the average reader. It is an inspirational story, as Dirie goes against the odds and achieves the unexpected in life.    One of the major themes of the memoir is violence against women. From early childhood, Dirie is the victim of rape and genital mutilation. She takes control of her life and flees the desert when her father tries to seal her fate in a hopeless marriage, but even outside of the desert, Dirie faces sexual assault and the ever-present burdens of being a Somali woman. Even when she reaches the Western world, she is still reliant on men in order to get her passport, forcing her to put up with theft and abuse.   This theme of violence against women compliments another major theme, which is the individual working within detrimental political and economic structures. Whether she's working for below minimum wage at McDonalds or trying to get a passport to work internationally or not being able to return to Somalia due to warfare and political instability, Dirie must navigate these oppressive structures, and she always comes out on top. She does not allow the world to oppress her, continually seeking out better realities.   Despite such violence in her life, Dirie does not remain a victim. She constantly pushes forward despite the unknown and achieves her goals in life. She has surgery to alleviate the complications of her circumcision, and works with the U.N. to speak out against the practice. She starts a family with a man that she loves and never forgets where she came from. Desert Flower is a must-read memoir for anyone hoping to better grasp the diversity and possibilities of life.
0060589280|1.0|I have read two of Paulo Coehlo's books (The Alchemist was the other one) and that's about it for me. His writing is so simple and so limited in description that one does not get to know the characters and surely does not get to care about them very much. Eleven Minutes (the time for the sex act) traces (and I mean traces)the heroine from her pre-pubescent experiments to her full fledged prostition to her fairy book ending. It is not informative, not believable and not interesting. It makes one wonder if Coehlo ever had sex or was in the places he fails to describe adequately in the book.<br /><br />Coehlo has become a very popular author so my second try at his work was intended to help me discover what I missed before. Both books were a waste of time. This is popular literature at its worst. It is the kind of paperback that sells well at airports and train stations. I wish I could find some redeeming features in his writing but I am afraid I can't. Goodbye, Paulo.
B0018CWEYY|5.0|This is the best show on TV, Cable, and even the big screen...I couldn't stop watching, we watched season 2 on Netflix, then bought the rest from Amazon.  It's now sad that NOTHING compares... we are lost without LOST for good TV entertainment.
B005D81W5Q|5.0|Yes, everything you've read is true. Incredibly dumb movie. Foul mouthed. Not even funny. So don't watch it, you won't like it. That is, unless you enjoy watching the hottest 39 year old beauty on the planet earth, walking around for ninety minutes, her perfect slim body in tight dresses and high heels. Unless you are stunned by her chiseled features and blue eyes. Her long blonde hair. Her sassy irreverent talk. Unless you are a helpless Cameron Diaz devotee. And in case you think that she just keeps getting hotter and hotter and hotter, every year. Then you might like it.
B005U9RQNU|5.0|Found show on Netflix was bored and read what this show was about..  took a chance and decided to watch season 1 did not fully get into it until episode 3 of season 1.  I have seen 3 seasons on netflix and rented 4th season on amazon. I am addicted watched seasons 1-4 3 times and need to see these characters everyday. I need to get a life!!  Hope season 5 is well written...I don't want the show to end....hey what happened to mike gus's right hand man! He will show up in season 5 betcha!!  I don't want walt to die..ever!!!  I NEED A BREAKING BAD DETOX PROGRAM.... 12 steps anyone!
B001UV4XJ2|3.0|I'm not buying the U.S. version, the region free UK release will include the Blu-ray 3D + Blu-ray + DVD and a real Digital Copy. No UltraViolet Digital Copy.
B0017I1FP8|5.0|Progressive strong and moving musical composition.  I usually don't like orchestras, but this is great for testing out my home theater system.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|Runs fine on HTC Incredible running 2.2. Functions like it should. Really wish people would stop whining about an application that's FREE. If you don't dig this kinda game, then come back tomorrow &amp; see what Amazon has next. For those that care: I found no flaw in the little I played this so far. Pretty simple, straight forward match game. Good for kids. Not so much for the avid match game enthusiasts.
1936719010|4.0|The work's subtitle is \\"Overcome resistance and get out of your own way,\\" and it covers some tips for actually, wait for it, doing the work. It's a bit centered on work in the form of writing, but actually a lot of the tips are useful for work in other areas as well.   The central idea of the book is simple, and one I wholeheartedly agree with: Whenever you try and do anything worthwhile, you will encounter resistance. The Bible, I believe, supports this idea strongly as well. God doesn't call us to do the easy, and promises opposition and difficulty. Pressfield, from a secular perspective, more or less agrees -- if you're doing something worth doing, it's going to be hard. Pressfield goes beyond resistance. Yes, you'll encounter resistance, but rational thought will also prove to be your enemy -- you'll come up with all kinds of reasons not to do what you ought to be doing.   Building on this basis, he proceeds to giving some practical tips for actually doing what we ought to do, beginning with \\"Don't prepare. Begin.\\" He fights the tendencies to try and learn everything there is to know about a subject before starting, to plan too much, to make too detailed an outline, to stop and rethink in the middle. Start, then finish, he argues. When finished (with writing), THEN you can go back and make it better. Don't do that along the way, because momentum is everything.  There are lots of good tips here. But, a word of warning -- the book is really unusually formatted and written. It's more of a collection of sayings or principles than a coherent narrative. And it's really brief. It's not something I normally would have read, but I found it for free for the Kindle a while back and picked it up. (Now it seems to be $6.75).   Overall, I would recommend it if you're a procrastinator, have trouble finishing things, or have trouble even starting. I think it was helpful to me -- though I know a lot of what's here already, it was a reminder that I've got some work that I just need to finish. I've got to set aside time to really do the work -- if I always let the seemingly urgent get in way of making headway on what I really need to do, I'll never finish. I need to give some of my best time every day to finishing up these projects... \\"Resistance\\" is always there but I've got to overcome it and do what I ought.
B001IMFHTS|5.0|This wonderful set was out of print for about a year. It has just been reissued and I have owned mine for a day. The quality of the production is simply perfect. In addition, the price is so low that anyone can afford it. You simply cannot miss this set.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Bought this for my husband who is a star wars freak.  He loved it... he hasn't watched it yet, I honestly think I have to buy him another set so he can leave one unopened and one he can watch.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|if you hate when all the ones you need are at an angle this game level is just less time so need some improvement fun time killer think DMV line.  its free wouldnt pay full but as faod not shabby
1423140591|5.0|Excellent!!!<br />I love it!!! The characters are great, the references to previous books are just right, I think you can read it without the information of the \\"Percy Jackson\\" collection; but it wouldn't be the best idea.<br />I can't wait for the next book.
B004LZFWJO|1.0|1 star for the publisher reviewing his own game.<br />and yes the game is bad. not recommended at all. it froze up twice
B005WTR4ZI|5.0|Whether you think about economics, technology, politics, or work, this book is a MUST READ. For half the price of a magazine in the checkout line, throw this book into your shopping cart NOW. No need to read more of this review when you can read the book!  OK, you want more convincing?  1. BREVITY - It is SHORT, which is a huge favor to the reader. I have often bemoaned authors who think we buy books by weight instead of the weight of the ideas. These authors respect our time and have filled a quick read with succinct and persuasive ideas. You can read this in one sitting, as I did, and you won't put it down. Lots of protein and no fat.  2. IMPORTANCE - The data, the information, the ideas, and the prescriptions are CRITICALLY IMPORTANT for all of us to understand. They explain how technology is accelerating and the social and economic implications of this trend. Anyone who does anything in society today needs to understand the implications.  3. EXPLANATION - We hear so many ideological and misguided prescriptions for the lack of jobs, lack of growth, lack of equality, besetting American life today. This book explains, in absolute clarity, the origins of many of our problems. Unless one identifies the cause, one cannot explore the solutions. This book explains so many phenomena in our economy so clearly that your jaw will drop.  4. RELEVANCE - Do you identify with Wall Street, The Occupiers, the Tea Party, the GOP, the Democrats, Silicon Valley geeks, or are you an independent thinker whose views are unique and belong to you alone? Regardless, this book is a timely, no, an essential guide to explaining where we are and why we're here. It's not ideological, it's not political, it's not preachy. It's an intelligent, logical, calm, focused discussion of how technology is affecting our lives, and how we can work WITH technology to address what ails our economy.  If you're still reading this review, you're wasting the precious time you could be using to read the book itself.  Please note: I have no connection to the authors and have no incentive to wax so enthusiastically about this tome. I just wish that more people would understand the discussions and arguments in this book, so we can get about the job of finding solutions.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|For a free game (today only), not bad! There are a lot of \\"Bejeweled\\" type games out there, but I do like this one because you swype your finger (unlike many games where you tap to swap items), and you can move diagonally (rare for these kinds of games).
B005YDLJ76|5.0|I;m going to love this DVD. But I hope the 7th video isn't going to be \\"Dance For You\\" but rather \\"End Of Time.\\" And the only other thing I'm a little upset about is the no live audio CD. ): But I know someone will get some, or it will show up on iTunes *sips*
B0054SMIH6|4.0|I found this movie to be surprisingly entertaining. It wasn't particularly \\"cookie-cutter\\" as so many movies seem to be coming out of \\"Holly-weird\\" these days or a \\"Reboot\\" of a previously made movie. I also appreciate that they included the \\"Southern Twins\\" in this movie  \\"McConaughey and Lucas\\"  I'm pretty sure they are either Twins or Clones or Cousins!!! Just Sayin!!! ;)

B0031R5K72|5.0|Today, Sunday the 10th July, around 1:55 AM, I had finished the most beautiful book I've ever read. A book, though breathtakingly beautiful, it showed mankind at its worst and its best. How? I have no words that could tell you. Maybe the words were there, but they weren't enough, no amount of them could ever be.<br /><br />I couldn't find one word that could that could describe the way this book made me feel as I burned through its pages full of life and death and as I read every single word it held so dearly.<br /><br />Words, words, words. It was also the story of Liesel's love affair with words and yet the words themselves could not do her story any justice. I'm sure, sure as Death, sure that even from the moment I read the first words that I was then a lifelong fan of Marcus Zusak. Making Death the narrator was truly original, very unusual indeed. He gave Death a personality, a personality that was interesting and that had drawn my attention and approval from the very start. Deaths was kind, had a sense of humour and believe it or not, he had a heart.<br /><br />Now I attempt to share and describe my thoughts and my feelings. It was like riding some sort of emotional rollercoaster that had begun slowly and gradually gained momentum. Happiness had been constant after the cloudy days, but that didn't mean that sadness and despair wouldn't catch up. They did. Oh, yes they certainly did.<br /><br />The ride had been bumpy here and smooth there. I was drawn to Liesel, to her innocence, the way see saw the world and the monsters in it through her observant childish eyes. Her world was a dark one but now there was her new Papa and Mama, Hans and Rosa Hubberman, and not forgetting our lemon headed friend, Rudy Steiner. They shone through her gloomy days of black, lonely cloud filled sky like bright stars of hope.<br /><br />Then there came the books, how could I forget the books. Liesel and her beloved books. And Frau Herman who gave some. She had stolen one even before she could have even read, but Hans, her Papa, her gentle Papa taught her how to speak their language, how to use them, to befriend them and in return the words had comforted her and accepted her as a dear lifelong friend.<br /><br />Her not-so-gentle Mama was there helping Liesel along in her own special way. Oh and Rudy! Oh, boy, Rudy! I loved him. I loved him for being him. I loved him for his will and character. I loved him for being a fighter, for not giving up. For his spunk and his pranks. Most of all, I loved him for just being there, his existence alone brings a smile to my lips, salty with tears, and for being there for the book thief.<br /><br />Then there came Max. Max who, in my opinion, had a great impact on Liesel's life. They both had much in common. A filthy Jew was how many saw him and his kind, but oh, I hope to God that he didn't think of himself that way because I know and so did Death that Max was nothing of the such, well not filthy, figuratively that is. He was scared and scarred, guilt ridden and was hopeless. But he was kind, thoughtful and creative. He saw a ray of hope in the book thief. He had lost so much and was full of memories of his family. But he had the Hubberman's to whom he was extremely grateful for they had put their necks in the line of fire for his, and he also had Liesel who made his days bearable.<br /><br />This was some ride. Hans was like a father to the girl and considered her his own; he was her Papa after all. The way Liesel would describe him and his accordion and his mannerisms I could clearly see him before me with his silver eyes and gentle loving face. At times I felt that he was my papa too. Hans Hubberman was a strong and honest man.<br />Liesel was right when she said to herself that this ugly world didn't deserve Max and Mr. Steiner, nor did it deserve the likes of her Papa and Rudy.<br /><br />I want to lighten the gloomy atmosphere; it doesn't do me any good at all.<br /><br />I enjoyed peeking into theirchildhood days; Liesel's and Rudy's. Rudy the saukrel who had always longed for the kiss of a certain sticky handed book thief. The best friends stole together, laughed, played and grieved together, but alas... oh, here I go again all gloomy and I nearly spoiled a bit over there too.<br /><br />How they ate their looted fruit, oh and how it came out again, but Liesel had gotten off the hook that time; her sharp Papa blamed the soup! And Rudy's little war with that Hitler Youth fanatic, Deutscher. And that Jesse Owens incident!<br /><br />The two of them had guts all right, and that was evident from their other stunt with the Jews and the bread. I must cut this short because I could go on forever. It's now 3:05 AM and I'm gonna get a hiding myself.<br /><br />Marcus Zusak is an artist, like Death with his colours, who knows how to paint not only with his variety of shades but with their unforgettable words. Words that will remain with me forever. As long as I live.<br /><br />I have to admit that the bits of profanity, \\"Jesus, Mary and Joseph\\" and \\"crucified Christ\\" had me chuckling.<br />I've learnt that war is an evil that masquerades as a necessity for defence and , ironically, for peace. Though The Book Thief may seem just another book, it's not. It was a reality for the countless Liesels, Maxes, Rudys, Mamas' and Papas' back then. A reality for Jews and the Germans and people all over the world. And it still is a reality. People are still living and going through what Liesel had. Yes, today, as I write this review. Today as you read it. War.<br /><br />The Fuhrer has made himself an enemy of me. Dead or alive, it's the plain damn truth. The war was stupid and senseless , precious lives were lost for nothing at all but for a crazy man's stupid belief, his prejudice and arrogance.<br /><br />I must now conclude that the end of that rollercoaster ride was rough, rough I tell you. Bumpy beyond belief. Sharp turns, sudden breaks. So high and so steep was that fall, I nearly hurled off of my seat.<br />I cried.<br /><br />Oh, God, I cried on this early Sunday morning as I sat on the washing machine in the laundry room when I had finished Death's last words:<br />\\"I am haunted by humans.\\"<br />Oh, Christ, oh Crucified Christ!

B004LZFWJO|4.0|It's not worth the 2.99 price in my opinion, but it's a fun app to have. It's quite addicting once you start playing.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|I'm so tired of people reviewing apps based on selfishness. So the app don't appeal to you think of others. Easy fix don't review or get the app.  This app is fun and challenging.I was going to get it for my kids but I enjoyed it to. game play was good graphics on DROID 2. Worthy of 5 stars.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|What an original concept!  Blurting out all your secrets to the one guy who turns out to be your new sexy boss. As the story unravels you don't know what to expect. Sophie Kinsella rocks! I love all her books. She's got the page-turning, laugh-out-loud gift of writing that translates well through all her books.
B005IGVYUG|1.0|The LOUDNESS of this CD is so oppressive that I simply cannot bear to listen to it.<br /><br />Clearly the dark acolytes of the Big Buck, with dollar signs for eye-slits, slipped the hitherto esteemed Bernie<br />Grundman a Mammonite hotshot, morphing him into his evil alter ego, Grunty Barfman, and hence the mastering job.<br /><br />Why has Tom Waits done this? Does he think the Ipod crowd are going to embrace him and<br />he can hang out with Casey's buddies? The other shame is that many of his other albums<br />set new standards in the richness of the sound -- the sheer sound of sound -- such as<br />Real Gone and Mule Variations (also mastered by Bernie Grundman). This is unbearable.<br /><br />The sensation after three songs -- which is all I can endure -- is of someone having<br />banged a biscuit tin with a spanner for five minutes, right against my ear.<br /><br />I really hope that an actual CD mastering of this album will appear in due course and<br />then it can take its rightful place among Tom's other albums -- I have them all.
B000TLMWLK|1.0|Is there another version of this DVD? Louis armstrong did make an appearance on the Johnny Cash Show ---  he Sang \\" Ramblin' Rose and performed a duet with Cash-- \\"Blue Yodel #9\\"
159562015X|1.0|I am very disappointed in this book. It gives the impression that by understanding your strength it is easier to find the right individual path that leads to your own success. But this is not the case. Instead, I got very vague descriptions/action plans on the strengths that apply to almost every situation. For example, for the strength \\"achiever\\", the action plan includes something like \\"select jobs that allow you to have the leeway to work as hard as you want\\". I clearly expect something more than this for 10 dollars. In addition, three of my five top strength sound extremely similar to each other, which makes the results even less useful. I wish I could get my money back.
B001HNE3NO|3.0|Once I caught the drift of the two alternating stories, I was hooked.  Generally I steer away from more holocaust books, but this one reveals the horrific participation of the French Police, a portion of history the French later hoped would be overlooked.  The historical references to the treatment of small children, torn from their parents and left with no adult care, will remain with me always.  As the book progressed there were few surprises, but I learned from it and found it an interesting read, and an easy read.
B004LZFWJO|2.0|not to fond of the swipe games, and it was way too easy at every level. plus you can swipe two diagonally, and still counts. I would DEFINITELY NOT have paid 3 bucks for this, okay as a faotd.
B005JABSB6|5.0|Great glasses..amazing 3D experience watching movies on a Sharp 3D TV (check my other review for that). These came bundled and they work great..dont even think about going passive..active shutter is much more superior..enjoy
B005LJITS0|4.0|good comic book action flick. i'm not sure what WB promised with the UltraViolet copy, but I mainly stream these days. users should really email WB and complain, rather than rate the movie based on WB's actions. that's like rating it 1 star, because you haven't seen the movie, because you can't get it for some reason. kinda annoying.
B005GVA2L0|4.0|I'm not listening to the same album as many other reviewers here. Her voice is a bit buried in the production at times, yes, but that's as far as my bitchin' goes with this album.I hear it just fine for most of the album. I love this new sound and I fail to hear how every song sounds the same and is the bane that apparently happens in every band's career (I have no idea where people get those \\"concrete\\" statistics from). Many of you want Amy Lee to regurgitate 'Fallen' and 'Origin'. I won't even try to figure out what sense that would make as a band but I don't care. I know everyone has their opinions but for Christ sake, you all sound like you're reading from the same script. And no, I'm not just taking what Evanescence gives me blindly just because I'm a fan. I genuinely love the album. Amazing how people get attached to such particular things that they won't even entertain a little difference. Ah well, such is life I suppose lolz.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|This one is nice but has a bug. The pieces are moving in slow motion. I do not have this with the versions from GAMP. I agree, it is overpriced but I'm only taking stars for bug &amp; it's not as good as CS2. Still Recommended. Ty Amz &amp; Dev.
B00601J5CC|5.0|OMG!  I'm addicted!  I'm constantly on the edge of my seat.  Moments do happen where I feel a yawn coming on then BAM! I'm jumping and screaming.
B002ZG99A4|3.0|Do you like explosions?  Action stars full of steroids?  How about tons of cheese?  If you answered yes, then sit back, don't worry your head about plot or character development, and enjoy the eye candy of explosions that the eighties made us love.
B004LZFWJO|2.0|Kinda boring game with graphics that were *yawn* rather basic.  I expected more for a game that retails for 2.99.  free would be OK but not 2.99
B0034G4P8A|4.0|A very different take on the old Marvel formula.  Thor transports you to a world of fantasy and myth rather than the normal Marvel movie realm of science fiction in a modern world.  If you don't take it seriously, then you'll find it fun, entertaining, and at parts moving.  The special effects and epic landscapes are brought to near-life by BluRay.
B005EY2XFC|5.0|I have been a true Crow fan since I heard what the story was based upon. I had this movie on VHS and waited year after year for it to be remastered on Bluray. I loved it even more on Bluray! \\"IT won't rain all the time.\\" But, seriously there were moments in the film when it had a bit of a glare to it and the color was gray black at times. However, the overall appearance of the film had a good look to it. The surround sound is awesome! The Crow (bird) at times looked 3d. Just a great movie and it does look much better in Bluray that is certain! If you loved it on VHS than you gotta love it on Bluray.
B002HR1W1K|4.0|Great British take on American action films from the great minds that brought us Sean of the Dead.  Every cliche is brought into this smart, fast-paced film, but the juxtaposition of the small English town setting just makes it even more ridiculous and fantastic.  Laughs and yells from beginning to end.  Enjoy!
0140282033|5.0|I have lost count of the number of times I have watched the movie that is based off of this book, so I figured it was time for me to read the book. Like most movies based on books, the movie is only about half true to the book. In this case though, that did not really bother me.<br />Joanne Harris has a way of writing that has me savoring every word like one of Vianne Rocher's fine chunks of dark chocolate. What I would have given for a few recipes of the dishes she served in La Celeste Praline, especially the pots of chocolate that were served as frequently as coffee. The descriptions of the various confectioneries and even the non-chocolate dishes were detailed with a light touch, so that I never felt too overwhelmed -- but I still wanted to dive into the pages all the same.<br />All of the characters, large parts and small, were unique and original, even down to the quirky preferences and hidden burdens. I could easily relate to Armande's attraction to the color red and her unrefined mannerisms, as well as Guillaume's indulgence of his pet dog. So many of the characters could pass for people that I encounter every day -- from Roux's skepticism to Josephine's renewed independence to Caro's need to control. These characters will stay with me for a long time.<br />Probably the most interesting character, aside from Vianne Rocher, is the town's priest, Pere Reynaud. Like most of the rest of the town, he masks inner demons and makes up for them with his profession of choice. Though those inner torments are slowly revealed through the course of the book, I don't feel that his story was completely resolved, or that he even experienced any true character growth.<br />Vianne Rocher is certainly the most creative character in the book, both easily likeable and eternally mysterious. Haunted by memories of a nomadic lifestyle with her mother, she intermittently addresses her conflicting desires to both travel and put down roots even as her simple, self-taught cooking and hospitality brings about subtle and lasting change in the village of Lansquenet. A thread of fantasy runs through the plot as Vianne hints at the ability to read people's thoughts, choosing not to influence them, and consults her mother's tarot cards in her darker hours of contemplation. She even adds a touch of magic and mystery to her Chocolaterie to draw the wary villagers into the shop. Oh, what I would give to pay a visit to that amazing place myself.about subtle and lasting change in the village of Lansquenet.

B004LZFWJO|4.0|Cute game that is pretty easy.  My 4 year old likes it.  I would never pay 2.99 for it.  Especially when you can get much better developed games for less.  99 cents...sure.    I wish people would stop giving bad reviews to apps because they don't like Amazon.  If you don't like the FAOTD,  don't download it, move on.  Good or bad apps,  I'm glad Amazon is offering something for free.  I've gotten some pretty awesome apps from Amazon for free.

B003UAKE9Y|4.0|My first grader has inherited my affinity for scary flicks, though of course all that she's been exposed to is the kid-friendly variety. Coraline is the darkest of all the \\"scary\\" flicks we've watched this October, but we watched it together, discussed various aspects whenever she had a question, and surprisingly she did not find it scary though she did comment on some parts being creepy. I think for her age, she probably did not quite grasp some of the darker aspects of the movie, but she did get the gist of the movie, and the message behind it.<br /><br />Coraline's story bears the message \\"the grass is not always greener on the other side.\\" Coraline complains about her life with her parents, at not being able to do what she wants, when she wants, blah blah blah. Until one day, she discovers a door or portal into another world, where everything seems so much better, just like her present life, only more interesting and appealing. Of course there's a catch, and the seemingly \\"benign\\" mother figure in this other world soon turns out to be vile and wicked with an evil agenda - to keep Coraline trapped with her forever, as with all the other lost children. Coraline discovers that not only does she have to escape this evil entity's clutches, but also save her parents who have become trapped in another world, and free the souls of the captive children.<br /><br />The animation is unique and interesting and fascinated both my daughter and myself. I certainly think this is a movie that is more appropriate for older children, ages 8 and up, but with parental supervision and guidance, it can be appreciated by a younger child. It certainly brought up some interesting issues for discussion between my daughter and I. Intelligent, well-scripted (and based on Neil Gaiman's novel), this is a movie I'm adding to our DVD library. Now if only Gaiman's [[ASIN:B002WUC5R2 The Graveyard Book (Hardcover)]] would be brought to screen!
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|I just got back from watching this movie in the theater and let me tell you that it was utterly fantastic from start to finish. The sheer genius of the people who put this story together is deserving of all the accolades that could be bestowed upon them. The story was utterly impeccable and the combination of the the old fairy tales, the Shrek films, and most importantly the behaviors of all our beloved pet cats are interwoven seamlessly into this story. I couldn't believe all the ways that they found to make this movie so memorably funny and endearing to the audience (and especially us cat lovers) that it was a really fun movie to see.<br /><br />Now if you are familiar with your childhood fairy-tales, the basic premise of the movie is that Puss (in Boots) along with Humpty Alexander Dumpty, and Ms. Kitty South-Paws start an adventurous trek to obtain some magic beans in order to provide access to the goose that lays the golden eggs. And yes, there just may be a beanstalk involved.<br /><br />I really can't tell you any details about this movie without risking spoiling a scene or two, but I will let you know that Humpty Alexander Dumpty, voiced by [[ASIN:B002U5Y96O The Hangover]] star Zach Galifianakis, is a pivotal character in this movie along with Jack and Jill. Although I think you may find yourself quite surprised by the movie version of these two compared to their pail of water exploits from the fairy tales. Another new character is Ms. Kitty Soft-Paws voiced by the beautiful Salma Hayek, who by the way does an outstanding job as Puss' love interest/nemesis.<br /><br />Now I am not going to post any spoilers, but I will tell you that I found one particular scene so funny that it is my most cherished moment in the movie and it involves a shot-glass full of milk in the first bar scene. And that is all I am going to say about that, but be sure and look for it. Perhaps you will even think it was as funny as I did.<br /><br />This is a totally awesome movie for kids of all ages, including us bigger kids. Definitely take the kids to see this movie and make sure they stay quiet as you won't want to miss any of the great lines.<br /><br />Shawn Kovacich<br />100% Cat Lover<br />Creator of numerous books and DVDs..

B002JVWR9U|5.0|I remember watching Ian Somerhalder back when he played Hamilton Fleming in the CW's \\"Young Americans\\" so I was eager to see him again in a regular show that didn't just last one summer.  As not a fan of \\"Twilight,\\" I wasn't too excited about the premise behind The Vampire Diaries but after watching just the first couple of episodes, I was hooked.  Yes, it does have the whole human-vampire love story factor that's saturating our screens at the moment, but there's something almost intelligent about this program that makes it a little bit different from Stephanie Meyer's romance-novelesque tale of forbidden love.  Most obviously, the vampires in Williams' show are not all brooding, pale-faced ninnies that snarl or pout the whole time you're watching them.  Stefan is brooding, but he's juxtaposed brilliantly by Damon, in what I can only describe as a Brad Pitt-Tom Cruise \\"Interview with a Vampire\\" relationship.  All of the main characters have a depth to them I haven't seen in this type of program in a while.  As a former fan of \\"Dawson's Creek,\\" the characters banter much like Joey-Dawson-Pacey, and while dialogue remains generally intelligent, isn't as completely unbelievable as in DC.  I'm kinda glad I finally gave this show a chance; its worth at least watching the pilot and isn't so much of a chick show that guys couldn't watch it.
B0060ICQAI|5.0|this show just gets better & better every season Never thought id like a show like this on but is seems so real as if it could really happen Damon is the best character he's funny as hell and A bad ass this show will def have more seasons to come.
B001MYIXAC|5.0|The following is an explanation as to why I prefer Let The Right one In to Let me In.  Many people think it's pretentiousness to prefer the Foreign film to the domestically made one but really, it's not.  It simply was a bad a film.<br /><br />1. I don't like the CGI. I see no point in adding blood with CGI. It looks awful.<br /><br />2. I do not like the implication that the boy is to be the next henchman (or whatever term you want to use). It goes against the original novel and the original theme of rare and true unconditional love without sex. The purist and most innocent love through darkness. That was at the heart of the original story and what made it so endearing.  Also to claim Eli had known her/ his henchman since that henchman was a boy is wrong. He's too bungling and incompetent.  He clearly is not experienced at killing and disposing of the body so how could he have been doing this his entire adult life? That version of the character in the remake does not make sense.<br /><br />3. The setting of the remake felt wrong. I like atmosphere and I like the unearthly quality of vampires and you lose some of that without the bare footed child in a t-shirt walking in snow and you can't see her breath but you see everyone else's.<br /><br />4. Making it clear that Eli was really a boy was important because it was the result of that mutilation that Eli was anti-social, avoided human society, was clearly awkward and shunned society with it's gender roles. Eli did not trust the outside world because of his secrets and because of what he suffered and some of that was lost. It takes away from the child vampire's tragedy. And the solidification of the fact that their love was NOT sexual but something far deeper.<br />  I think it's kind of depressing that we Americans can accept monsters but we can't accept that the child vampire was really a boy?  The fact that being a blood thirsty monster seems \\"more acceptable\\" to the audience than the idea of the child being a boysays something is really wrong with our society right now.<br /><br />5. I feel the Swedish actress was simply a better actor in general. The girl who played Abby is now in Dark Shadows and I've been watching interviews with her and she's spacy and acts... well, kind of high...<br /><br />6. I just tend to prefer films that follow the original source material better.<br /><br />7. This was the first good vampire film since Twilight. And by \\"since Twilight\\" I do NOT mean that Twilight is good, but rather the first good vampire film since the whole annoying fad started!<br /><br />8. The remake disappointed me for another reason as I expect more atmosphere from the recently revived Hammer company and they let me down.<br /><br />9. I don't like finding out that the reason the title was changed was \\"The original title is too long for Americans.\\" (real reasoning). That offends me. Especially when the original title was based on an English language song by Morrisey and the song definitely suits the movie. And the follow up short story is named for the next line of the song, Let the Old Dreams Die.<br /><br />  The interpret it that OsKar / Owen (what's the point of changing the name?  We have Oscars here in the US) is the next henchman hurts the film and the entire theme of the movie that love, actual unconditional affection, without need of sex, can bloom in the strangest of situations. That was at the heart of the story. For the boy and for the monster. And if you deliberately strip that out for the sake of your \\"interpretation\\" the entire message and meaning of the movie is lost just to appease contemporary and cruel cynicism.  It's wrong to completely twist the very heart and meaning of the story to appeal a cold, modern interpretation based on the disturbing fact that people today have become too cynical to accept the notion that love can bloom anywhere at ny time with anyone. The heart of the story was that Oskar could love despite the fact that Eli was a monsterand not really female and that Eli would love to a degree of fierce protectiveness she/he never gave to the henchman. To dismiss this and turn the film into something colder and shallow. And to be honest the mindset that does this... disgusts me.<br /><br />  The writer of the original story said what it's about and wrote a follow up story to prove the way it's supposed to be seen.  He says that Eli eventually makes Oskar a vampire after they finish the blood pact when they get off the train. To act as if he's wrong about the outcome of his own characters is like telling a child they are wrong about their own imaginary friend. That it's not a pink rabbit but rather a green bear.<br /><br />  Watch the original, skip Let me In.
0786939532|5.0|I first heard of Drizzt quite a few years back when my cousin was reading the series, but back then I wasn't one for reading very much so I didnt think much about it. Now this year I've finally had my interest in the series piqued after searching for a good fantasy series after reading a slew of Mystery/Crime-Noir novels for so long. Salvatore has been writing about Drizzt since I was born ('88)...which is pretty impressive for any character. He has a huge following and rightfully so!<br /><br />HOMELAND is the first in the the DARK ELF TRILOGY which is the prequel to the ICEWIND DALE TRILOGY which was actually written before the DARK ELF TRILOGY. I read that some suggested to start with the ICEWIND DALE TRILOGY but I decided to start with HOMELAND and learn where Drizzt came from. I imagine either trilogy you start with you'd be rewarded.<br /><br />Salvatore has created a character that he clearly loves and it shows in his writing. His ability to describe the battle scenes through out HOMELAND are amazing and very detailed. I can't wait to delve into the rest of the books/trilogies and find out where Drizzt is today. I've got plenty of tales to catch up on. So here's to more decades of Drizzt! I'm prepared to stay on board until the last novel comes.

1423140591|5.0|A wonderful book. I couldn't put it down. It had riviting twists and turns that kept me aching to read faster yet inhale every single word slowly. I love this book and I'm proud to say I'm a Percy Jackson geek.
B002CIY8EM|5.0|I read this years ago, but lost it. I recently picked it up for Kindle and rediscovered this the master's classic' on Ancient Astronaut and ended up enjoying it more than I did years go.

That page could be linked on the front to make it easier for everyone. Game is fast and a great pace to keep you hooked.  Once I realized I could even match 2, game went even faster.  Sure,  I wouldn't pay $3 for it, but with so many free games, I'm cheap.  And it gives me very little perspective to what a game price should be. I'm think $1.99 at most, but it was my efforts being paid for, I'd probably want to charge more too.  All in all, great game. Sweet!!

B0038M2AZA|5.0|The movie has a bit of a slow start, but quickly grows to a true-life story of amazing inspiration.  My teenage son didn't want to watch it at first, but, at the end of the movie, he gushed that it's now his favorite of all.  About two weeks after watching the movie, we were gifted with front-row seats to hear Ms. Grandin speak at a scholarship fundraising dinner.  She is all the movie shows her to be, and more.

Brilliant writing, wonderful acting, with some new faces (at least for me) and a show that is really for the family. Humorous, sometimes laugh out loud, but usually clever, subtle humor; with a terrific cast who can execute humor or longing, using their bodies and seem totally believable. And from day one, an emerging love story that will have you pulling for the 2 fantastic leads - Yvonne Strahoski emerges as a very talented actress, and continues growing thru the years. Zachary Levi does a delightful job as CHUCK, and he has also grown as an actor. Fine directing.  Congrats to the creators, Chris Fedak/Schwartz for providing the intelligent audience with a thinking persons show...that can appeal to a wide audience.  Am hoping USA picks up the 6th season. Too bad so many people have missed out on this very smart show.

The first day I think she made us watch it around 5 times and we were right she loved it just as much but probably a little more than we did. One feature that I really like especially since I have a younger child they have a feature where it just goes from song to song instead of viewing the whole movie, she loves this part almost as much as seeing the whole thing.
0671027344|2.0|Ok, so I'm definitely in the minority with this book.  I didn't really like it at all.  In fact to me, it was a book for teenagers trying to be angsty to try to relate to.  But even then I'm not sure how they could relate to some of it.<br /><br />The book is told through a series of letters from our main character Charlie, to an unknown person that he actually doesn't know as well, but heard that they were a good person.  It tells of his first year of high school, the friends he makes, the things he does, the sadness he faces and all other emotions wrapped into one.  He goes to parties, reads books recommended by his attentive English teacher, falls in love, and deals with his family issues and pours his heart out to the recipient of the letters.<br /><br />For characters I thought they were written ok but I didn't relate to any of them and nothing convinced me to like any of them.  Charlie's friends are a pretentious group that in reality would probably have nothing to do with Charlie.  And that leads me to the main problem of this book, Charlie.  There is something wrong with Charlie and it goes beyond being an angsty teenager.  I admit that there are some aspects of his personality that some people could probably relate to, but all of them together leads me to believe that charlie is autistic, albeit a high functioning one.  In fact, when he got his license I got a little scared for his fictional world.  His letters show him as childlike and immature but we were led to believe through all of them that he is actually quite brilliant.  But we only have his word to go on it because based on his letters he is not.  The reactions to him are not normal either.  If he was truly the way he says he is, people would avoid him, make fun of him, etc.  And as far as being a wallflower, I've always associated that with shy people who have trouble making friends.  Charlie is neither shy and he appears to be ok at making some friends and not hanging out in the back of the crowd at parties.  In fact he is the center of attention sometimes.<br /><br />Although the letter writing is creative, since Charlie was the narrator I didn't enjoy reading the book.  I found it tedious and boring at times and too many themes were thrown in to make it believable.  And some of the most important ones were just glossed over.  Its written for young adults but there is a lot of mature themes in here like rape, abortion, abuse, etc.  But its handled indelicately and doesn't really express how serious these types of issues can be, and that scares me for any naive readers who happen to pick this book up.  This book also has a tendency to pick a few things the author thinks is \\"cool\\" (and thinks others will think is cool) and then proceed to obsess over them, which was just annoying.<br /><br />I won't say this was the worst book I've ever read but it definitely wasn't very good.  Speaking from a true wallflower who was shy and unpopular in high school, it simply wasn't realistic.<br /><br />The Perks of Being a Wallflower<br />Copyright 1999<br />213 pages<br /><br />Review by M.

Also, the webside is garbage, confusing to navigate (i.e. version 1, or 2, etc), and offers no help for this situation (which seems to happen all the time based on other reviews)  It is unfortunate that this purchase was a waste, because the book seemed to be good
0385344325|5.0|I picked up my first Lee Child novel when someone recommended \\"The Enemy\\" in Spring 2011.  I was instantly hooked on the main character and devoured all the rest of Child's series on Jack Reacher in the next six months.  It is genuinely rare to find a fictional character so utterly rock solid and compelling.  The Reacher character never wavers, but becomes more and more familiar with each book.  He moves into your mind and becomes like a fictional partner or best friend.  Fantastic writing and character development.  The short story \\"Second Son\\" was totally worth reading as a character insight piece.  The last book \\"The Affair\\" brought so many threads together which had been left tantalizingly dangling from the previous Reacher stories.  What a great accomplishment for non-chronological presentation. Lee Child is a great story teller and I am utterly addicted to this series and cannot wait until the next one comes out.  Until it does, I may very well read them all again.

B00008WJBU|4.0|This is a strange offbeat film that, like '[[ASIN:B0018O4YT0 Dark City]]' or '[[ASIN:B002ZG980U Inception]]', is a nudged parallel reality to our own existence. Everything familiar is strangely alien, a world and its people that are darkly askew and never seen straight on.<br /><br />The film's premise is that Luck is a tangible energy, one that can be bartered, gambled, accrued, and even stolen from you. The vast majority of us have very little of it, so we live our lives in the monotone plain of obscurity.<br /><br />However, a fortunate few have amounts that warrant note. And for those few - a different world beckons. It's a foreboding and terribly dangerous world, but with it comes the dangled dreams of luxury, pleasure and vibrancy. The adage that you never feel so alive as when you come close to death is the foundation upon which this world's reality is based.<br /><br />The few with preordained prosperity are given the opportunity, very selectively, very underground and very illegally, the chance to improve and add to their fortunes via twisted forms of illegal gambling involving physical abuse and, ultimately, death. Again, personal luck is an energy, one you have but can lose. If it's wagered then your luck is placed into a type of 'vault'. Said vault takes the form of an old fear: A picture captures a part of your soul. These gamblers carry around stashes of polaroid images. Each image contains that person's luck, and if you win, you can move onto progressively more deadly contests. Successive wins garners you that much more fortune, and with that comes money, power, and dreams fufilled. Until you lose.<br /><br />Into this bizarre diorama is Tom&agrave;s, played by captivating Spanish actor Leonardo Sbaraglia. A man who lives a barren life, one void of love and purpose. The reason? He was the sole survivor of an airline crash. The same crash which killed his wife and their only child. What's left is an empty tattered shell. But what he doesn't realize is that having gone through that horrific experience - his life is now filled with enormous luck; though you'd be hard pressed to convince him of that.<br /><br />That terrible incident brings him to the attention of Federico, played by intriguing actor Eusebio Poncela, himself once one of the luckiest persons on the face of the planet. But he's nothing now, just a normal gray person - a nobody. But he still has a life goal: Take revenge on the man who took all his luck. That man is Samuel, played by quintessential actor Max Von Sydow, and he is the literal King Of Fortune. He's the luckiest man alive. Through his own life experience by surviving the Nazi concentration camps and losing his entire family, and over the subsequent decades, has amassed a frighteningly amount of the intangible. The massive vault he uses holds a staggering array of polaroids; all categorized and organized into a sick twisted library/catalog.<br /><br />Federico needs an 'in' back to the games - and ultimately back to Samuel.<br /><br />The pair form an uneasy bond, each with goals completely separate from the other, all the while furtively dodging arrest. The games are so illegal that it's now attracted the attention of the police. The authorities have picked up only hints and rumors of strange gambling all over the globe - and now one street cop has gotten closer than any other before her. She's hot on the trail of both Tom&agrave;s and Federico, convinced that she'll break the group's secrecy.<br /><br />The fates of these characters eventually intersect at one dramatic moment - each having gone \\"all in\\" with their luck on the cosmic gaming table.<br /><br />This is a wildly imaginative film that will be enjoyed by those who can see beyond the literal.nce - his life is now filled with enormous luck; though you'd be hard pressed to convince him of that.

0451233948|5.0|Excellent reading material by a well known author who knows how to tell a story. Even though the volume is quite lengthy, it is still a worthwhile read.
B004ZNAGNE|4.0|I enjoyed both discs to this new set, but I wish a bit more thought had been given to the packaging of this and the entire \\"Why PF?\\" campaign. I actually won this set, brand new, through a contest, and right out of the shrinkwrap, there was some pretty noticeable dents on the inside of the album. Plastic inlays would have fixed that issue.<br /><br />Overall, not the best, but a very nice product, music-wise.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Angry Birds Rio is one of my sinful indulgences. I am insanely addicted to it. The creators of this game really knew what they were doing when they came up with the idea. I have all three versions and have beat every level. I still find myself going back to try to achieve those 3 stars on each level. I have been playing Angry Birds about a year now, and I can't get enough of it. I take breaks every now and then but I always go back, waiting for the next update.<br /><br />I have seen similar games out there on the market and nothing seems to compare.
1594744769|2.0|This young adult novel is based on a series of very unusual old photographs, an odd set-up that nearly worked, but in my opinion completely missed the mark.  I found the central character, Jacob, extremely unlikeable. He reminded me of the female protagonist in the young adult novel \\"Revolution.\\" But that character had a dead brother, a sick mother, and an absentee father to blame for her emotional turmoil. Jacob, on the other hand, has a two-parent cushy life that he can't seem to get comfortable with. Fair enough, it happens, but I was never sure how Riggs wanted me to feel about Jacob -- was I supposed to think his self-induced ennui was cool? Was I supposed to pity him? I didn't quite get it.<br /><br />Jacob is the narrator and his writing skill is impressive for a teen (though often nearly sunk by the overuse of adjectives and metaphors) but this is explained away by our being told that he takes accelerated high school classes. His burdened writing and hopelessly hateful attitude made the book often difficult to slog through but slog I did and that's because the plot points in the first half reeled me so powerfully that I couldn't stop in until I discovered what had happened to Jacob's grandfather (BTW, the only character I found appealing, a Polish Jew who fought in WWII). However, as I entered the fantasy world of the book's second half, I felt as if I was Judy Garland as Dorothy Gale, poised to open a door into a living color Oz but instead ending up in an peculiar world of drab grey. It's different but not terribly appealing or even interesting.<br /><br />However, it's a credit to Riggs that even readers who don't like the book will probably have difficulty not slogging to the bitter end where we find some key questions answered, see a key decision made, and watch a sequel -- shamelessly? -- being set up. The idea of basing a novel upon quirky old pictures is one that I find fascinating but the end result in this case isn't as good as it looks.

B003VS0CWO|5.0|Much loving care has gone into presenting this cult classic on blu ray.  The picture has been fully restored from the original camera negatives and the film appears amazingly crisp and sharp.  Any other version you own needs to be replaced by this.  The video really is a revelation.  From beginning to end the colors are bright and true, flesh tones are very realistic, black/white ratios are superb and the clarity is amazingly crisp.  How they got the film to look this good is miraculous.  Every classic scene will be as if seeing it for the first time for it is so vivid you will notice everything in each picture frame.  At times it is as if the characters are jumping out the screen.  And the audio is even better.  It has been enhanced to DTS-HD 7.1.  The film was originally done in mono and you must get used to the difference in levels with dialogue and the music.  The dialogue can still sound a little canny due to its original source but the music comes to life gloriously.  The music as well as the vocals bounce from all the speakers making magic.  And this film is about the music.  Each amazing track comes to new life.  You will quickly adjust to the dialogue being at a slightly different level and then see THE ROCKY HORROR PICTURE SHOW as never before.<br /><br />If you are a fan, this purchase is a must.  It has the US and UK versions, comes in a glorious digibook with pages and pages of color pictures and also has extras galore from the famed live experience to deleted musical scenes and outtakes.  Many think this film is only truly magical when viewed with the midnight live audience participation but that is not true.  With the quality presentation it has here it can be enjoyed alone or with friends.  This is truly a magical gift to fans of this cult classic.  And if this film is new to you and you love high class campy fun this is for you.  Take a look at the hot pics of Tim Curry.  If that entices you, then you will love this film.  Highly recommend.  This is blu ray at its best.blu ray at its best.

B005P9SLES|5.0|I absolutely love this show from the amazing cast, the superb chemistry between Alex O'Loughlin and Scott Caan, the beautiful scenery and heart pounding action.  The filming of this series takes full advantage of being in Hawaii. Each episode is filled with lush shots of Hawaii scenery and people.  What a disappointment when it seemed the first season was only going to be released on dvd, especially when it was shown on tv in HD.  Amazon has not carried the blu ray but for those of you who don't know it, it does exist!  It is one of those rare BEST BUY exclusives.  Hopefully Amazon will eventually be able to carry it as well but in the meantime you can go to your nearest BEST BUY or purchase it on line.  I did and am so happy for it.  It costs $49.99 and is worth every penny. All 24 episodes appear on 6 discs and there are tons of extras also shown in HD.  And the blu ray presentation of this show is even better than you would expect.  Every scene pops with intense clarity and vivid color form the lush scnery to close ups.  Colors are vivid and pop realistically.  The audio is also superb.  Dialogue is strong and present and when the action surround comes in it takes on amazing life.  And you will hear the classic theme song sounding better than ever.  I am so happy I purchased this blu ray and if you are a fan of the show awaiting blu ray get it right away.  I watched the whole season in days.  Highly recommend!

0062011847|4.0|[[ASIN:0062011847 Snuff: A Novel of Discworld (Discworld Novels)]]  Does this book feel different from other discworld novels? Yes. Is that a bad thing? Not necesarilly.  Some reviewers have mentioned it feels like closure for a few of discworlds inhabitants, I tend to agree. They have evolved into people that you may not want them to be but that are set to live their lives even without Sir Terry writing about them.   The story does jump around a bit and is told between the 'Jane Austen' brackets (as it only really appears at the beginning and end of the tale). The approach is not as subtle as some other DW books but on the whole a good comment on culture, class, perception, herd mentallity and 'progress'. Maybe it takes a little adjustment for the hardcore Discworld fan but I feel it is an enjoyable read.  One of the reasons I like the series is the great desriptions. Example: heavy rain has been described as; 'a vertical river', 'the sea invading the land via the air' and 'so hard the drops had to queue to reach the ground'. This book has another one on rain and plenty more on other subjects, I just love that.  A last word on the changes. I do not believe these are because T.P. is 'losing it'. Throughout the series things change, ankh-morpork goes from medieval to victorian, Carrot evolves from naive, to cunning to mature, to name two. These changes are there for a story-telling reason. I think the same applies here.
B004XJHBCE|5.0|As others have written, I believe this is the best Android application I have used to date. Being a software analyst and tester, as I work with software on any platform I'm constantly thinking &quot;Wouldn't it be great if this app could do X?&quot; Well, everytime I ask that question with FolderOrganizer, I end up finding out that it can!   To be honest, I downloaded this app one day because it was free. And it sat there for a few months without my touching it. Then, just a few days ago, I started exploring what I can do with its widgets, and I was hooked! I've gotten rid of 2 pages of standard app icons and all my apps and widgets are much better organized.  Although I didn't pay for this app, I would do so in a heartbeat knowing now what it can do.  Grazie mille, Fabio! E veramente fantastica!
B005IGVYUG|5.0|For my money, BAD AS ME is Tom Waits's best album of all-new material since 1999's MULE VARIATIONS.  Don't get me wrong: ALICE, BLOOD MONEY, and REAL GONE all had their strong points (though the latter is perhaps my least favorite of Waits's albums).  But BAD covers pretty much all sonic realms that Waits has covered in his career: barroom country/jazz, rock, blues, and what can only be described as a cornucopia of sound.  All of it is compressed into thirteen songs on the original release (sixteen if you go for the deluxe album, as well you should).<br /><br />Personally, I prefer Waits at his most melancholy, when he's dissecting relationships against a haunting jazz piano (\\"I want you to kiss me like a stranger once again\\"), or examining the chaos of a drug den (\\"New Year's Eve\\").  But nobody rocks like Waits does, and his jam on the title track is spectacular.  He pays tribute to the Stones on \\"Satisfied\\"(Keith Richards joins him on a handful of tracks here as well; their harmonies on \\"Last Leaf\\" bring to mind BONE MACHINE's \\"That Feel\\"), and gets politically angry on the surging album highlight \\"Hell Broke Luce.\\"<br /><br />Some tunes on here, such as \\"Raised Right Men,\\" don't really stand out in Waits's cannon; they're enjoyable more for what they are--entertaining ditties--than what they add to Waits's rich catalog.  And, indeed, BAD AS ME is far from Waits's best album.  But it's his best (hell, his ONLY) album in a while, and it's a good one.  In spots, it's even great.  Waits is still writing and performing some of the most beautiful/ugly music out there.  His lyrics are like poetry, his instrumentation is like a Rorschach test.  You never quite know what you're going to experience when you turn on a Waits album...but you damn sure know you'll enjoy it.
B005IZLPME|5.0|I never read the original Captain America comic from the 40's, but considering this is probably the first of at least one sequel for \\"Cap\\" I think the film was very well done. Chris Evans looks the part and I guess I will get over him having played the Human Torch in the two Fantastic Four film. It's a little light on \\"Cap\\" action, but the story is pretty easy to follow. Great FX and casting make this one a winner for Marvel fans and also gets us pumped for next summer's Avengers film, but purist may find flaws I didn't notice or care about.<br /><br />The three disc 3-D/Blu Ray/DVD combo has some interesting extras making of etc. and an excellent looking Blu Ray transfer.
0470913029|5.0|This book was recommended by a friend of mine. I love this way of healthy eating and it makes complete sense to me.The book itself can be a bit boring in the beginning, but having said that, I think it is important to read it so you will know and understand the concept of this way of eating. So once you make it through the first part of the book then you will get into how to eat the Paleo way which has been for me an amazing healthy experience.
0143035711|4.0|This is the first story I read to get a perspective from the pilots in the helicopter war.  IT was great.  I have since read \\"To the Limit\\".  Both stories are of pilots who served in the same unit, though at different times.  It's interesting how similar their perspective of the war and the daily grind was for them.  Chickenhawk doesn't offer as many different experiences, but it is still a great story.  Though I enjoyed \\"To the Limit\\" more, I strongly suggest reading both stories.
B005NXD6PA|5.0|Several years ago, Amazon put Lana del Rey's 'Gramma' as a free song. I hunted high and low but couldn't find any other songs from her for download. Even on YouTube it was scarce (she did a fabulous version of 'happiest girl in the whole usa' and another song about a scary boyfriend, can't remember the title). but this girl is the goods. her debut will be album of the year, she will rack up all the grammys.  I hope 'gramma' is on the debut album - that song will haunt your dreams. Part little girl, part tramp, part Sandra Dee and all amazing, this is a portrait of what happens to that fun-loving party girl you'd like to think has no soul. Rooting for you Lana/Lizzy!

B004LZFWJO|4.0|This is a fun game to play, and while it looks like just another Bejeweled type game, it is different enough to make it worth trying. The only thing I wish it had was the option to turn off the timer.  Some of us don't like being timed while playing.  Also, the gameboard doesn't fill the screen, so the pieces are kind of small.  Playing on an Evo 3d.

I have 8 GB DDR3 1600 of RAM memory, so opening a lot of web pages at the same time is not match for an equipment like this.<br /><br />I also play games at ultra or high graphic options with no problems.<br /><br />Overclocking is very easy, stable and temperatures are very down.<br /><br />I can't end this without say that I had more expectations from this processor, it is a shame that AMD did not make it as we all wanted to be, but at least it's not expensive so you can get a great processor for less money.
0385523394|4.0|This book/author does a great job of setting up the experiences before she got to prison.  She is the first to point out that she is a privileged white woman thus recognizing the added burden of being a person of color and/or poor and/or lesser to no education.  The story is engrossing and yet can be candid, comical and irreverent while still be a serious author.    I like the details of day to day experience and we get a rough idea of what it would be like to be in prison, something you'd never have any clue about until you actually have experienced it.  There's a mild lull about 3/4 of the way through but she pulls us through and comes around the bend redeeming the story and the author.    Hearing the realities also caused me to appreciate the multiple and daily luxuries that we take for granted.  That is, closing a door to shower, access to quality food superior to what sounds like the equivalent or less of a grade school cafeteria.  Being able to select clothes that fit us, being able to purchase a radio, however cheap and inefficient, whenever you want and not having to wait until you can pay $25 or $50 for items in the commissary that are quadrupled in price.  However there is no other way to get/have those items other than purchasing them from the prison supply (if it even gets restocked every again) AND relying on family and friends to send money into your account otherwise no deal, you are out of luck and must endure living a life of minimalism that is forced upon you.    Finally, what I find so intriguing is that it ALL revolves around the personality of the person who is currently in charge and available at that moment.  Knowing that one guard enjoys playing a power trip on ppl, while another may be a nice person just doing their job.  It's the not knowing, the unexpected that can keep up a level of perpetual anxiety.  And forget it if you lose yourself for a moment and give some attitude or don't answer in a way that is deemed sufficient, you risk goingto solitary, an experience every prisoner treaded like no other.    HIGHLY recommened.  It's not 5 stars just because of the lull in the 2nd half of the book that was short lived.
B001HN6922|3.0|The first Cars movie from 2006 was one of Pixars best movies. It had a great plot, outstanding visuals and an excellent soundtrack. Only outstanding visuals can be said for the sequel. Rather than one plot it seems as if there are two and the sloppy transitions between storylines affects the flow of the entire movie. The first movie was mainly about McQueen and him discovering that there was more to life than being rich and famous. In the sequel McQueen travels the world with his friends and competes with the world's best race cars. This storyline was pretty cool but then his buddy Mater gets dragged into a spy thriller mess. It is basically about gangsters and corrupt businessmen sabotaging the World Grand Prix race that Mcqueen is competing in. While this storyline provided for some of the movie's best moments and introduces some cool new characters, it just seems out of place. I also found that a few scenes were a little too-much for Disney's G rating. Multiple character deaths and implied death take some of the fun out of the spy storyline. As for the soundtrack nothing caught my attention. From the first Cars I was able to grab about 5-6 tracks and listen to them on an MP3 player but with Cars 2 I honestly didn't care for a single song throughout the whole movie. This movie is fun for kids and I had a bit of fun watching it but as far as a quality movie it is a bit of a disappointment. Pixar is responsible for some of the best movies ever and they are certainly capable of alot more.
0446619078|4.0|Another Harry Bosch book; quite good. It was written some time ago, which I should have paid attention to, however the writing is okay and the Bosch story interesting.
B004SJUB8A|4.0|So this was a movie that passed me by a long time ago. But, having recently watched \\"The Thing\\" in theaters, it made me think of this one. So I sat down and gave it try, even though some of the reviews had me seriously wondering if the film was going to be bad.<br /><br />So, after watching I must say...to heck with the negative reviews! It was a good movie. A blend of science fiction and thriller. The concept of how the alien force enters the astronauts' bodies is intriguing. There aren't a lot of dazzling special effects that show you how this all occurs though (just a little bit of special effects), and you won't be seeing any gruesome aliens with writhing tentacles emerging from a mother ship.<br /><br />Nope, just an interesting story combined with great acting, which equates to a good movie. If you like stories involving aliens, and don't need a lot special effects, you'll enjoy this one.<br /><br />As for the story being like Rosemary's Baby, which some other reviewers have mentioned, I can't speak to that (never seen Rosemary's Baby). But really...who cares? There are cyclic patterns in the Universe, so it is the same with movies and stories. Big deal.
0865479186|4.0|You may not know author Ben Goldacre.  He's British.  He's also a doctor, and a science writer.  His work appears in the Guardian.<br /><br />Goldacre also has a finely tuned BS detector.  In this book, he takes that detector and looks at how science and medicine is reported in the popular press.  It turns out that those representations are usually wrong.  They're that way because everything is over simplified by reporters that apparently don't know what they're talking about.  Sometimes the problem goes deeper too.  The people creating the data misreport or misinterpret the data they create, with varying degrees of malice.  The book builds with Goldacre debunking various people who have his behind science and exposes them as the quacks they are.  It creschendos with a take-down of the MMR scare over the supposed autism link.<br /><br />The best thing is that he explains the statistical subterfuge and the medical mysteries in plain language.  You feel smarter, and not talked down to, having learned what is real -- and what is BS.<br /><br />The key takeaway, as Goldacre asserts, and I agree with is this: \\"I'll think you'll find it's a bit more complicated than that.\\"  I've found myself internalizing this lesson, becomming even more skeptical than usual.  Last night the news reported that aspirin lowered the risk for colon cancer, and I said to myself: \\"There's more to this story.\\"
030788743X|4.0|Imagine a dystopian future where the Earth has run out of food and space and the poor turn to a virtual world called OASIS for relief.  Much of their real lives take place in this world through primitive three-dimensional immersive \\"rigs,\\" from communication to education.  It's like Second Life crossed with World of Warcraft.<br /><br />There are a few peculiarities to OASIS.  Although you can level up like a Multi-User Dungeon, if you die you start over at level one.  I played Ivory Towers, one of the most brutal player-killer MUDs of its time, and even then if you died you lost just one level.  OASIS is divided into sectors, and transportation isn't free; participants earn credits to buy a ship to fly between planets. Some planets allow player-killing (you can kill other members of OASIS) while educational worlds are not.<br /><br />The creator of OASIS, James Halliday, is a cross between Richard Garriot (creator of Ultima) and Steve Jobs (of Apple fame) who seeded OASIS with 1980s esoterica from music to video games to movies. When he finally dies, Halliday wills his billion dollar fortune to the first person to beat a variety of quests to find his \\"easter egg.\\"  An entire sub-culture evolves to meet the challenge, called gunters (abbreviated from \\"egg hunters\\"), whose archrivals are IOI, a corporate organization that will stop at nothing to get the egg first, win the game, and make OASIS a pay service only accessible to the rich.  It's every man for himself against the Man himself.<br /><br />Our hero, Wade/Parzival, is up against every other gunter, along with his virtual friends and rivals: best friend Aech, brothers Shoto and Daito, and the cyberpunk goddess Art3mis.  Ready Player One is as much a love story as it is a retrospective on what made the 80s so much fun: Pac Man, Tetris, The Tomb of Horrors, Wargames, Godzilla, Monty Python and the Holy Grail, Zork, Adventure, Joust...it's all here, waiting to be remembered by those of us old enough to care and rediscovered by those too young to experience it.<br /><br />For a book all about the geeky details of 80s trivia, it occasionally gets it wrong.  On the world of Gygax (ya know, Gary Gygax, the co-creator of Dungeons & Dragons) our hero must survive The Tomb of Horrors, and he beats the dungeon by reading the original module.  He didn't read it too closely however, or he would have been confused by how a demi-lich like Acererak could challenge him to a game of Joust...demi-liches don't have physical bodies, just a skull:<br /><br />\\"All that now remains of Acererak are the dust of his bones and his skull resting in the far recesses of the vault. This bit is enough! If the treasure in the crypt is touched, the dust swirls into the air and forms a man-like shape. If this shape is ignored, it will dissipate in 3 rounds, for it can only advance and threaten, not harm.\\"<br /><br />But I'm pretty sure I'm the only one who noticed.  I played Joust, Pac Man, Tetris, and Adventure on the 2600 and was terrible at all of them.  I beat Zork. I knew Wargames and The Holy Grail by heart. I'm still an administrator for a MUD (RetroMUD). And I ran a party through The Tomb of Horrors. Like Wade, I met my the love of my life over a virtual game. Heck, [[ASIN:078645895X I wrote a book]] about my gaming experience that's not nearly as exciting as Ready Player One.<br /><br />As other reviewers have pointed out, Ready Player One is a little too slick for its own good.  It's written like a movie that glosses over the details in the spirit of a rousing tale.  The conclusion, which involves a massive battle between IOI, gunters, and our heroes, is so contrived to strain even virtual credibility - the otherwise strategic bad guys guard some vulnerabilities while leaving others wide open, the hero exploits some weak points but fails to press his advantage when he should, and the high stakes of the grim real world often overshadows the virtual one.  Ready Player One tries to have it both ways:When Wade digs up convincing evidence that IOI is willing to kill people in real life to win, it's hard to believe there's enough justice in the world to care.<br /><br />Ready Player One is a delightful romp for geeks who venerate the 80s.  For geeks who lived it, it's a 80s homage, part of a corporate full-press that has more in common with IOI than Parzival.

B001KVZ6LQ|5.0|This is a good blu ray.  NO doubt about it. They did a fine job with the print here as far as cleaning it up. But it is a 80 year old movie so you can't expect it to look like a newer flick. Still the extras are good on this one ,and one of the cinemas alltime greats deserved this treatment. It's not perfect but at least it's not a scratched up mess! Like lets say 'galaxina' or a dirty print like 'kelly's heroes'. However I would say that if  you love old movies like this one and I bet even some people that are young today still love this old movie with it's stop motion effects too, then you will be pleased with this blu ray. It's as good as we can expect at this date with a film this old. Picture wise I was impressed mostly but then I have seen prints from movies from the 90's that looked all beat up on blu ray. This is more classy; but don't expect the clarity in all scenes that a modern movie would have.

B004ZNARH4|4.0|After almost 30 years since the original release, it's nice to see these reissues.  While there are a few items in this box set that I could do without (a scarf?  3 marbles?  really?) the rest of the materials and the discs are worth the price to me, although I'm sure many would be happy with just the \\"experience version\\"  which includes the Guthrie remastered album and the live version from London 1974 without all the DVD dolby 5.1, quad mixes and video content or the original and alternate 1970s mixes.  I never saw the documentary in this set, and thought it was a nice little glimpse into what went into the album, although the VH1 doc got much more in depth.  I'm really happy with the quality of the actual content considering how old the original tape is and how some recordings get squashed in conversion to digital formats.  I think this was well-done, and the live performance on disc 2 is impressive, especially when you realize it was a time when bands had to actually be able to perform without pitch correction programs to fix their vocals, and had to really be able to play their instruments.  Again, I'd say for the serious collector or fan who doesn't already have everything included in the set (not counting some of the doo-dads mentioned above) it's worth the investment.

B000FDEUFS|5.0|I went for the Deluxe Edition to get the June 71 Fillmore Show.  I did see the Brothers live in July 71, within weeks of this show, when they were at their prime.<br />I'm happy with the results.  Finally a live Allman Brothers mixed in 24bits.  Crank up the vulumn and it sound like you are trippiing on the lip of the stage with the band playing around you!<br />The recording is clean.  I'm ok with the mix.  the drums could have been brought up a db or two but mixing is an art and subjective.<br />What you get far outweighs the drawbacks.<br />This second CD is a jewel.  The band is playng a little laid back but clearly have refined the jams.<br />Compared to the other Allman Bros live of the period, I may reach for his one the most.  Since I love beautiful recording, this is the disc I'll be reaching for.  Atlanta offers great playing but very inferior sound recording.  Owsley's is great but not mulitracked.  Fillmore East is great but analoge mix.  Ludlow garage is poorly recorded on half track.<br />Nice to win a gamble these daze!  Thanks for getting this one right!
B004LZFWJO|2.0|Not the best game, not the worst. Didn't freeze up and ran smoothly. Okay time waster but only if there is nothing else on your phone to play with. Might be  more fun for 8 year old girls. Most people will fun this mighty lame.  The good news for FAOTD reviewers is the permissions will be within the acceptable range preventing the standard dialogues.  I guess it's worth 2 stars - 1 for 8 year old girls (they need games too) and the other for preventing the permission war.
B0000DG00B|5.0|No holding back on these two concerts.  The Brothers are playing full throttle.  This is some of the best playing I've heard.  the drawback is the recording is lacking.  The mix sounds good but sounds like it was done in 16 bits.  You get two shows, great playing, good enough recording and a great look at the band just as they are beginning to jell.  Audio not perfect.  I'm glad I have it.  Won't be my first choie when listening to The Brothers.

B0050SYS5A|3.0|Our apartment is tiny and I had been trying to deal with only having 5 ft in front of my Kinect. We decided to try the Zoom and it seems to work okay. Hand movement is definitely a bit weird sometimes, but it's pretty worth it to not have to move the couch into the kitchen anymore. We had to move the Kinect to the very edge of the TV stand because we were getting the error where it couldn't see the floor.  Overall, a bit choppy and rough but works okay. I've played Sports bowling and Dance Central and it seems to work with only small misses.

B001Q94TQA|4.0|Without a US release of Once on Blu-Ray, this region-free Blu-Ray from the UK is a good substitute. The picture quality is fantastic and the best reason to upgrade to the Blu-Ray from the DVD, or to buy the Blu-Ray over the DVD. As for the audio quality, I was a little disappointed that the Blu-Ray did not feature an upgraded audio mix from the stereo mix on the DVD; this is quite likely that the original theatrical release was only a stereo mix, but it would have been nice for a little upgrade in audio quality.<br /><br />Some previous reviews noted that the additional content did not play for them on this UK release - I had no problems playing the bonus material. It is likely that the bonus material is in the PAL format used in Europe as opposed to NTSC used in the states, and if so then it is probably and issue with not all Blu-Ray players and/or HDTVs being compatible with that format.<br /><br />As for price, definitely buy from one of the other sellers of NEW copies on Amazon - half the price for the same Blue-Ray.

B001HN6922|2.0|This movie is a bit of let down, especially after the fun adventure and coming of age story that we had to deal with though the use of a small town the first go around.  Instead of continuing on with what was established in the first, we get what pretty much comes off as a movie to be used as a cash cow of sorts to sell toys based around all the new characters introduced in this film.<br /><br />No longer about a small town and the other cars in it, now this movie focuses around  a world wide race that Lightning McQueen has been selected to participate in. And of course, since we have to have some side kick comedy , Mater somehow tags along for the ride.  And mix in a lot of new faces and cars to the fold and you have again what comes off as a weird toy advertisement from start to finish that is by far the worst film the Pixar company has ever released.<br /><br />We have a movie that could have been the first in the series for all anyone viewing it can tell. It is about random cars in a race in three seperate countries with a weird side story of some Hummer type vehicle running said race wanting to use the race as a way to spread the word of his new more eco friendly fuel. The foils to the story are the reject and lemon based cars who are jealous of all these other cars having all the success and luck in life that they want to sabotage the race with the use of some ray gun that will over heat the new fuel in these race cars and cause the fuel to be a complete failure. A very weak story all around that never really goes anywhere and seems to get stranger and more ridiculous as the movie goes on.<br /><br />New characters include secret agents who are trying to stop the evil cars from exploding the race cars like Finn McMissile the British based, James Bond wanna be who  somehow mistakes bumpkin Mater for the US based secret agent where 'ha ha hijinx' ensue.  Female secret agent Holley Shiftwell who provides the female focus of this story with Mater being the focus of her affections and Miles Axelrod and Professor Zundap playing the rolls of the foils for this film.<br /><br />What was missing here was the old favorites from the first.  Doc Hudson has been retired from the series due to real life death of voice actor Paul Newman which of course was understood. But we had really no Sally, Ramon, Sheriff..etc at all in this film. When they do show up it was forced and squeezed in just because they had to be somewhere in the film but served no purpose.  The story was weak and definitely the worst part of the movie. The new characters aren't so bad, but the plot is so poor they too seem to serve no purpose but to again be there just to sell new character figures in the toy stores.<br /><br />The charm and fun that the first had is long gone in this second go around. It's a very by the books, standard, milk the fans for as much as you can type of film and that's exactly how it comes off as you are watching it. You will enjoy maybe a few moments here and there but Cars 2 is a movie me and my family won't be watching again any time soon.

B001NEK2GE|5.0|After years of hand cramps, this programmable game pad has helped me back into the gaming world! Programming individual key strokes is as easy as it gets with the software program, simply click on the keypad on the software and then assign its keystroke by clicking the desired key on the PC keyboard. You can also creat macros which can have multiple keystrokes applies to a single key stroke on this gamepad. It's extremely comfortable if planning on hours of use for extended gameplay!

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I started reading this when it showed as downloading on my iPad the night before it was supposed to launch.(thanks Amazon!  It was intriguing to me to see and learn so much about the birth of the computer industry as we know it today.  Jobs had vision and a drive for perfection that probably will never be matched.  He did his best to impart that to Apple and I am sure they will have a culture of perfection for years to come.<br /><br />Steve Jobs the man had a lot of issues!  He was rude, mean, and completely crazy at times.  I think part of being a genius is that you are missing some of those filters that allow you interact with people.  Lucky for him he was usually the boss so he people had to put up with his craziness.  One of my favorite things they talk about in the book is Steve's \\"Reality Distortion Field\\".  I found this humorous and interesting to see how many people noticed it.<br /><br />AS for the book I thought it was well written and not too long.  Isaacson was trying to cover 55 years of Steve Jobs life, how long do you think the book should be?  That is a lot to cover!

0865479186|3.0|If you've ever heard the saying \\"There are lies, damn lies and statistics\\" and you already understand the meaning of it, then you don't need to read this book. Most of the book is about how bad data is gathered or how data can be analyzed badly or how data can be misinterpreted.  He does have some chapters on quacks that are interesting. Apparently the U.K. has one person, Dr. Gillian McKeith, who's not an actual doctor but uses the title because she has a \\"Ph.D.\\" from a nonaccredited correspondence college or should I say she used the title because she had to stop after she got slapped by the Advertising Standards Authority. Former \\"Dr.\\" McKeith is such a big quack even ducks should poop on her if they go by.  Although a lot of this book is dry, he does have one of the funniest paragraphs I've ever read on page 117. It's about chlorophyll and the absorption of oxygen. I laughed so much at that one I got strange looks from people. (I'm one of those people who read books in public.)  Overall, I'm not sure about recommending this book. For me, as I was already familiar with \\"Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics,\\" it was (mostly) a waste of my time. If you don't understand the concept of \\"Lies, Damn Lies and Statistics\\" and you want to, then it's worth the read if you don't mind a lot of dry writing about testing methods and data analysis. If that's not your kind of reading, then skip this book.

1451629184|4.0|I was very excited for this book to come out after watching ABC's interview with Jaycee Dugard a couple months ago. When I finally got this book from the library, I couldn't wait to start reading it! I was definitely sucked into the book very quickly. It did not disappoint.<br /><br />Jaycee Dugard's story is frightening. One day, she was a normal little girl living a fairly ordinary life. The next day, she's kidnapped by two people who can only be described as psychotic monsters. Not everyone would come out of that situation with as much resilience as Dugard seems to have. Luckily she seems to be adjusting to the outside world just fine.<br /><br />The treatment that Dugard received while in captivity is appalling to say the very least and some parts of the book were very hard to read and digest because of the treatment that she received. It's hard to imagine anyone, let alone someone so young, going through such treatment.<br /><br />This is truly a story of strength. Even if you have seen the interview with Ms. Dugard, this book is still definitely worth a read. There is a lot of detail not discussed during the interview that Dugard sheds some more light on in the book. I was so impressed with her strength for her and her children. This is a really wonderful story of the triumph of the human spirit.<br /><br />Bottom line: This book is an engaging story of how a person can come back from a really horrible situation.
030788743X|5.0|As many reviewers have noted, Cline draws inspiration from Neal Stephenson's Snowcrash and William Gibson's Neuromancer novels, but Ready Player One is not really derivative.  It's an update to the canon of cyberpunk fiction; although you don't have to be a fan of this genre to enjoy this superbly written epic adventure.  The novel is prescient about the (largely dystopic) future, where people turn away from the increasingly dismal real world and immerse themselves in a multi-player simulation world called OASIS; but it is also steeped in references to 70s and 80s culture that gave rise to computer programming; video, board and roll-play gaming and design; new wave and heavy metal music and geek-as-chic aesthetics.  Oh, and the notion that corporations are pure evil.  I won't go into many details, because so many reviewers have already covered that ground, but suffice it to say that Ready Player One is fast-paced, thought-provoking, impressive in its detail about new technology and, as I mentioned before, 70s and 80s culture.  Cline captures cyber culture in its every nuance, and he incisively projects where our current cultural, technological, political and financial trends could take us.  An exciting, beautifully detailed, sometimes harrowing book, Ready Player One is one of the best books of the last few years.  If you like authors like Philip K. Dick, Neal Stephenson and Daniel Suarez, you'll love Ernest Cline.  Highly recommended!

0670022950|5.0|There is more history than science in this book,making it easier to read for me than Pinker's earlier books.  The section that deals with probability and risk assessment is a little heavy going, but the rest is a delight to read as Pinker writes so well.  Of course I was predisposed to agree with his contention that things are getting better in the world, not worse.  Violence has declined in the world,drastically, and Pinker supplies ample evidence of the decline some cogent reasons as to why.

1590171993|5.0|In the first paragraph of John Williams's \\"Stoner,\\" the titular character, who spends his entire academic and professional career at the University of Missouri, dies in obscurity, having been held in \\"no particular esteem\\" by faculty and student body. That brutal assessment sets the tone for \\"Stoner,\\" which, in under 300 pages, details one man's failures in life with clinical precision. It sounds depressing and, yet, this is one of the most beautiful and oddly inspiring books ever written. After that brief, obiturary-like dismissal of one man's existence, Williams goes on to celebrate Stoner's determination to live a life of passion. Even if it remains out of reach, Stoner becomes something of a tragic hero for the 20th century. The book succeeds in large part because two seemingly opposing forces are at work. On the one hand, Williams places the story in a setting and time -- academia during, mainly, the 1930s and '40s -- most of us will not relate to and uses as page-turning plot points dissertations, class scheduling conflicts, lectures, and tenure battles that non-academics may consider trivial. On the other hand, readers of any occupation and background will identify with the young Stoner's attempt to break free of his parents and find \\"a sense of significance and purpose,\\" a mature Stoner's frequent moments of painful self-realization and profound insecurity (\\"he wondered if he appeared as ludicrous to others as he did to himself\\"), and Stoner's rare moments of triumph in his 65 years of living that declare to the world, as described in one of the most touching paragraphs ever written, \\"Look! I am alive.\\" Even after all this, Stoner never has his happily ever after. Williams seems to be saying that most of us will lead quiet, unremarkable lives that can probably, like the first paragraph of \\"Stoner,\\" be summed up in a few brief sentences and that, in the big picture, add nothing to humanity's accomplishments. But the beauty, as Williams shows, is in the details, the filler and backstory that make up our lives. Stoner doesn't defeat his adversaries, he doesn't win in any conventional sense, heck, he never even rises above assistant professor, but in each stage of his life, you have to admire his constant striving to \\"become someone other than who he had been.\\"

B005I64U5C|1.0|This review is based on the package for sale, rather than the movie quality.  The package comes with an \\"UltraViolet Digital Copy.\\"  What does that mean?  It means you will not be able to take the movie with you on your digital devices - you will have to stream it to them whenever you want to watch them.  You better have wi-fi or have an unlimited data plan to do that!  You can download the movie on your computer, and there it will sit trapped.    Had I known it was like this, I would not have paid the extra money for the set with \\"digital copy.\\"  I believe a digital copy is something I can take with me (a copy) on my digital devices without having to stream them each time I want to watch them.

076115728X|5.0|As an art teacher for 3rd-5th graders one thing that I am always trying to instill in their brains is that making mistakes is okay! This book is a creative way of showing how mistakes can become something more. This book is amazing for anyone of any age.
0783226063|1.0|I read this book just a year or so before the movie came out. Thought it was one of the best sci-fi books ever written (still think so nearly 3 decades later). As you can imagine could not wait to watch the movie. Still remember the dead shock of betrayal that lasted that whole evening and then some.   Talk of butchery. Dont think the makers actually ever read the book or understood what Frank Herbert had created. From a thoroughly woody Paul who goes through the whole movie, including many desert and fight scenes, without a strand of long hair out of place to awful looking baldies that were the Bene Gesserit to rain in the desert at the end - that was sacrilige.   My advice, dont bother. Watch the mini series from 2000 instead or better still, just read the book.
B004G600A4|5.0|Great story, great animation, fun characters and fun songs! I highly recommend this movie for people of all ages! It will become a well-loved classic!
B002VPE1AW|1.0|One of the most hyped movie ever. Saw it and boy is it disappointing. Sure the graphics are great and but you would think that for all that money they would get a story writer.   The movie is just one unending series of cliches that just dont stop. No story, just the usual gop of good simple natives, bad mean greedy foriegners and a lump of science bashing. And as you might imagine, the simple natives win but not before exposing that the greedy guys will stop at no cruelty to get their money. In the end nature (or God) all pulls together and whips the tar out of the bad guys. Whooppee, chalk one up for the good guys and kiss your 10 bucks goodye.
B004LZFWJO|3.0|This is a decent game for its type. Would like to see better use of the screen space by stretching out the playing area or allowing landscape mode. My Droid2Global plays it just fine, no issues. I for one am glad Amazon offers a FAOTD. I enjoy checking them out and trying new apps I may not have tried before. I have got some great ones so far.  I just pass on the ones that don't appeal to me and uninstall the ones I don't like.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|As expected the full series, clean and simple menu. 261 episodes, 32 discs, 11 seasons. Well packed, no loose discs when opened. It comes in two spindles (16 x 2). You will need to transfer / store them elsewhere if you want to see them in order, conveniently. Don't expect any extra content.
B004ZGI1V0|5.0|Liam Neeson's acting is nothing less than compelling as usual. The movie was suspenseful and intriguing. I'm not much of an action film person so it had just the right amount of action for my tastes. This movie kept me on the edge of my seat most of the time. Watched it at home on family night, the movie held everyone's interest!
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|I love this movie.  I was all set to purchase and then they changed it to UltraViolet video copy.  This means no local copy on your computer/device.  So when I'm on planes, trains and automobiles and watching my digital copies and they have no Wi-Fi you CANT WATCH IT!!!!!  So when I'm flying across the atlantic and the nearest wifi hotspot is a thousand miles away I\\"d be staring at blank screen.<br /><br />This is stupid!  Fight back, don't buy.  Buy it from Amazon Movies or iTunes and get your hard copy.
B004Z4LVZK|4.0|First let me preface this by saying that I had never even heard of this book before I found it, so I was NOT a victem of over-hype like some of the other reviewers I've seen.  Having said that, I thought it was a great story.  The earliest chapters left me ridiculously confused, but the main character Thomas, was also clueless, so I think it worked nicely.  The reader figures out what's going on at the same pace that he does.  Once the plot starts to pick up some steam, it doesn't let up.  This is a fast, action-packed book.  Was there a ton of character development?  No, but it really didn't bother me that much.  As I neared the end of the book, I purchased the sequel \\"The Scorch Trials\\" just so that I didn't have to wait to keep the story going.  This turned out to be a good idea, because I found that the conclusion of \\"The Maze Runner\\" lent it to being more of a Chapter One of a bigger story, than a stand-alone book.   The reason I say that it's not for kids is this: while it does read very EASY, most of the story is generally scary and creepy, while other parts are downright horrifying.  If you're a parent looking to purchase this for your child, I'd tell you to read it first.  Might be great for some of the tougher kids out there, but not for the more squeamish ones.
B004LWZW42|5.0|Really love the comic book movies. X-Men is one of my favorite. And how can you not love James McAvoy
0385534639|5.0|A lot of the reviews I've seen on here for this book are very, VERY long.  And I understand why.  I could probably write an entire novel length piece describing how much I loved this book, and why, but that's not going to be helpful, so I'll try to keep this concise.  Magical, compelling, mesmerizing, romantic, whimsical.  I've never before in my life MISSED being someplace I've never been, but that's how I felt as I finished \\"The Night Circus.\\"    I've never before done this, but upon completion of the book, I actually purchased a second copy, that is now wrapped up and stowed away, so that I can read my original copy as much as I want without fear of it becoming well-worn, while still having a beautifully preserved First Edition.
B005G4TJI4|5.0|All of these transformer movies are awesome. Kinda miss Meagan Fox though. Love having the digital copy, very convenient. I really enjoyed seeing the Nascar cars in the movie.
1439152799|5.0|I loved this book! We went to Kauai for a week and I never wanted to leave this engaging story. The twists and turns made me want to read \\"just more page\\" all the time, which of couse was impossible. I loved the characters who were richly developed and interesting. The writer did an excellen job! I loved Kate Morton's other two novels as well. This was every bit as good as those.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|Cute, simple game for a snowy October Saturday! Clear display, smooth play... Took me three tries to advance to the next level... Enjoy!
0446547654|5.0|The book came sooner then I had expected!  This is wonderful because it was bought as a gift!  Thank you!
B004ZIAB2A|5.0|If you enjoyed Kate Morton's first two novels you should enjoy The Distant Hours. I found this book, haunting, sad, suspensful and I found myself sitting up late unable to put it down. It is one of those books I found myself thinking about days after I finished it.
0385738765|2.0|Descriptions of players were scant.  Could not believe the stupid moves of the characters.  Later explained as mind control in next book, but the hint was not big enough in this one.  OK read.,but not as good as the 1st.
B0057R5XRG|5.0|I've spent over a week reading reviews from people who live on \\"screenshots\\".  I have no problem spending some money and actually watching the movie before praising or bashing a movie.  I am just finishing the first movie and all I can say is WOW..  This release is better then any version previously released.  I own each version and this just blows them out of the water.  I sampled each disc and then sat down this morning to actually watch the first movie.  Never has Jurassic Park looked this crisp and clear!    I bought this at Best Buy on Tuesday (release date) and have been debating returning it since all I saw was crappy reviews.  I wonder what is wrong with the setup of these peoples tv's.  I am playing mine through a PS3 and 51 inch Samsung 1080P plasma.  I switched the Picture Mode to Movie (most of the time I leave it on Vivid) and all I can say is amazing picture quality.  Until I get a full surround sound system I won't be able to appreciate the audio but it does sound great coming from the TV speakers.  Now I don't know if the BB version is a different product but I paid $60 and it was in a steelbook case with the Blu for each movie and standard DVD of each as well.   I learned a lesson from this release.  Don't ever come to this site before buying a product and never trust reading reviews/comments from certain people.  They think they know it all and for some weird reason they are out to bash something without even putting it in their players.  For this release I will say a picture (on a website) is not worth anything!  Time to start the Lost World now!!
B005PW3OS8|2.0|What a disapointing movie. From the super Nazi to the Captain himself. The effects in the movie were quite good but the story and the acting was terrible. Even Tommy Lee Jones was a disapointment. That in itself says something about the screen play. What a weak tie in to Ironman with SL Jackson showing up in the end. So I am guessing there is an Ironman Captain America and the Hulk meet Captain jack Sparrow and harry Potter sequel heading our way, with a cameo appearance by Shrek.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|what the hell, why would an app need access top my display, or require use of touch input, this is downright invasive!!! not really. didn't even play the game. 5 stars. one for being unoriginal. one for being  free. one for you, and two for me.
B005LY4B0A|5.0|A fun thinking game that keeps you challenged the whole way through. An addictive puzzle game at its best, even if you don't like spiders.
B000J103WA|1.0|I've gone through FIVE copies of this title now, and they all freeze up during playback and have been checked on 2 or more different HD-DVD players! This disc was manufactured by Cinram, who also manufactured every Warner HD-DVD title. I have almost every US HD-DVD title and have run into problems with about 20 discs from this manufacturer. Dead format or not, there's no excuse for this high a failure rate.  I'm still attempting to find a copy that plays properly, but this release still gets demerits for being show on video but processed with \\"film-look\\" to give it a slower film-like frame rate. Many concert videos in recent years have been doing this and it looks awful. But these do provide a good use for that otherwise silly \\"smooth motion\\" setting on many current TVs- turning that on almost undoes the effect!
0385344325|4.0|When I purchased this book, I didn't realize it would be a 'pre-quel' to the story of Jack Reacher, but I liked the idea of knowing what made this character in the beginning. Unfortunately, the story got bogged down with a lot of sex scenes and character development that wasn't necessary to move the story along. The basic premise: who is the slayer of beautiful women in a small town in Tennessee, got lost in all of the lead up to the climax. Not my favorite Reacher book, but worth a read.
B004SKHJF2|1.0|It keeps giving me a connection error when trying to set up on Xoom. I have uninstall and even tried the free version from the Android Market... Still no luck.
B004LZFWJO|1.0|This is by far the worst game I have ever played. The graphics were horrible and the game its self is lame at best.
B005H5H3LW|5.0|This is a wonderfully done take on the Star Blazers cartoon.  Effects are fantastic and acting is really good. Definitely a must see if you were a fan of the cartoon.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|I don't laugh at loud very often.  I rented this off of Amazon (didn't have a chance to get to the theater the limited time it was in the area).  I was almost crying I was laughing so hard - afraid I was going to wake up the whole house.  Great, cheesey acting.  As a horror buff, so many scenes being set up that you know what's going to happen, and it still works.  I could see some people getting a little bugged by the premise an hour into it, but I enjoyed it the whole way through.  Doesn't shy away from the blood or the comedy.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|Too..many..of...the..the..same..game..type. Please....I can't take anymore. Bejeweled beat you to the punch. Move on developers and come up with something we haven't seen before. That will make you more money than trying to ride this steadily fading gravy train. Ya it's not the same, but same general idea.
0679809015|5.0|My 2 year old nephew loved this book. He enjoyed opening the doors, naming the animals and making the appropriate sounds. Its quite small so its a great book to throw in the diaper bag and bring along.
0061122416|1.0|It is a easy read with a somewhat interesting story.  That's about as much as I can say for the good of it.  The whole thing is basically built around the idea that if you think positive thoughts and really try hard, then the universe or God or fate or some kind of generic force will help make sure you get it.  Personally, I think that is a really dumb idea (I'm all for religious belief, just not for the pop psychology positivism that people call spirituality these days).<br /><br />Even if you are in to that, I would image there are books out there with more compelling stories worked in.  You'd be better off spending your time reading something else.
0345528581|4.0|This book provides easy explanations of a ton of exercises that you can do with minimal equipment in your own home. The exercise programs require only 30-35 minutes a day 4x a week and are enough to really work you hard in that minimal amount of time. If you are the kind of person that dreads going on a 3 mile run, this might be the program for you. The iPhone app associated with the book is pretty great too.
B005H9B2CE|5.0|I like amazon instant video, because it costs the same amount to rent ti at a video store, and I didn't have to leave my house to do it. Thor is a great super hero movie. It has the character relationships and development that most comic book movies lack. The performances were great too. The whole experience totally deserves 5 stars!
B000XR4OC0|5.0|Great shoes!  I was a bit worried because when I received them they were a little tight  I ordered my usual size).  I am REALLY glad I kept them and did not exchange them for the next 1/2 size up.  The canvas has stretched out quite a bit and they are a tad loose now, but not so loose they feel like they are falling off.  They fit well.  They are a great shoe for just running around and have held up well over the last two months  I wear them every day).  I was worried after reading reviews that they might fall apart or wear holes in the canvas but so far they have held up to easy every day wear.  I am going to order another pair in red :)
B005UKK4Y2|2.0|This was not very funny at all, you can watch the trailer and see all the funny parts, very disappointing.
B003L77G6A|5.0|This TV series is getting better and better every year.  With the adding of more female characters, the boys are growing within their own emotional and relational surprise and wonder.  It seems the lost boys from season one are growing up in spurts with Peter Pan Sheldon looking around screaming \\"NO\\"!  Sheldon continues to remind the boys of their roots in never never land and we all smile and yell 'Bazinga' along with him.
B003ZSJ212|1.0|Disappointing and kind of sad really.  You'd think Lucas would figure out that folks will stop buying his movies if there isn't a compelling reason to buy them.  With the digital upscaling on most players these days there is no reason to buy this set vs. one of the older sets.  If you must see the deleted scenes (which face it you'll watch once), just rent it.  Plus if you find the constant \\"tweaks\\" annoying (I actually don't care anymore), then the vader \\"noooooooooooooo\\" may make you go postal.
B004EBZX6W|5.0|great app for a geek like me. the first time i used it , i learned stuff about my network that i never knew
B004LZFWJO|3.0|Familiar gameplay, OK presentation.  Nothing special, I probably won't play it again.  Maybe a 99&cent; app, but at least for me definitely not a $2.99 one.  For free I'll hang on to it for others to play.  Because you can make matches using only 2 pieces it would be a good game for younger kids.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|The game looked good on my  Toshiba Thrive. I had no trouble seeing the pieces. The only problem was that the game had a problem recognizing my swypes. Seemed like every other move I had to resywpe. I have high hopes and will keep trying because I like this type of game, appreciate that it uses a different sort of play (not straight lines) and hopefully whatever is up with the swype will improve.  I agree that it's not a 2.99 game though, I would buy it, but for less.
B0053YGYO4|4.0|I have been a fan of Coldplay since Parachutes and while I probably can't say that I like their newer stuff more than their older stuff, I appreciate that they are willing to change and evolve and not keep releasing the same style of music or repeats of previous successes.   This album is a welcome change, since for a while, I have felt that Coldplay didn't really push the boundaries of their music until Viva La Vida. X&Y was a great album, but I was worried that Coldplay was starting to sound a bit repititious and \\"safe\\" by releases songs like \\"Speed of Sound\\", a good song, but one which followed too closely to the \\"Clocks\\" theme. Viva La Vida showed more experimentation in different styles and sounds and this album furthers that experimentation.   I'll admit that I am not a fan of modern pop music and this albums jumps in that direction, but I believe it is well done. Yes, the album is overproduced, but in my opinion, some of the best albums are overproduced. Examples: Beatles: St. Peppers, Pink Floyd: Dark Side, U2: Achtung Baby, Radiohead: Kid A. I was a bit worried about the inclusion of Rihanna, but I actually like the song and think it works. \\"Paradise\\" although a well-liked song is my least favorite song on the album and is what I would call a \\"safe\\" song that harkens back to their previous successes.   Highlights on this album are \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\", \\"Charlie Brown\\", \\"Major Minus\\", and \\"Don't let it break your heart.\\" These songs are unique and different sounding and show Coldplay's breadth of musical skill. My hope is that Coldplay's next album will follow into an even more experimental direction, be a little more oblique (and dark perhaps) and less \\"safe\\" sounding.  This album is a defining success for Coldplay.
B0052UZIFA|1.0|I'm sure glad I got this while it was free. Force closing on my phone all the time, loosing my progress... What a waste. Popcap sure does suck as a developer for android. Guess they should stick to iphone only development if they cant program for a real phone OS.
B005IS565S|4.0|Only a TINY bit different!    I bought this album without even giving it a second thought because I have been a huge fan for the first 2 albums and even back to Ivan's previous band motograter.  On a side note, I was given a kitten named Ivan and kept the name because Ivan Moody is a bad a--.) As I was listening to it, I just couldn't help but feel something was off.    (Background)I have two rock categories that I listen to.  My angry, punch you in the face, \\"workout music\\" and my \\"good rock\\" that is usually mainstream and in the background of whatever I may be doing throughout the day.   This paragraph is for the angry rock mindset(what I was expecting and looking forward to).  I was trying to figure out what was off to myself because it is hard to pinpoint.  My best guess is that they have lost a little anger.  Let me clarify, everything is the same on this CD.  The lyrics, the screaming, the riffs, guitar solos, etc., etc.  What seems different to me is that some words while they're singing don't sound like they're pissed, more like they are telling a story.  I bring this up because I have at least 6 songs on each of their other 2 albums on my workout playlist.  But I can't see putting but 1 or 2 at most of these new songs on my playlist.  They don't have the attitude of \\"I'll slap you so f'in hard it'll feel you hit a freight train... f-- you\\" attitude. They have an I'm on top and just maintaining it, or mainstream, attitude.    With the mindset of listening to a mainstream rock band, then I would have given this album a 5 star rating.  I see myself listening to this album for a long time to come and it will grow on me even more over time.  They do a lot of different types of songs in their unique style and it's an awesome album.  The heavier songs are still heavy and the slower songs will have you singing along.  In fact I have only heard the album about 4 or 5 times and find myself singing along.  Even the slow song \\"Remember Everything\\"  has really grown onme.  I can't wait to start restoring my car or even taking a shower listening to this CD. lol  I know my review was disappointing at first but it was because of what I was expecting.  I highly recommend you buy this album whether your a 5FDP fan or not.  Great rock album period.
B000TNF7OC|4.0|Time has proven that this album is more relevant today.  This is a magnificent album, showcasing a skilled, seasoned band on the verge of their prime. Metal, boogie, blues, country roots rock and 60's instrumental (check out the Hank Marvin-esque \\"Lipstick Traces\\") are all present and prove that this band was not a one trick pony.  If you consider yourself a rocker, then this should be in your catalog.
B0001MLMKY|1.0|Enjoyed the watch for few months. Very light watch and perfect for day to day use. However, the prong of the buckle broke in half. I was very much surprised for a Swatch to do that. I called Swatch customer service and they told us that I should contact the seller. First of all the seller does not have a direct number. They tell us to leave a message. We left many messages and yet to receive a call back. Very much disappointed in the seller. WATCH OUT. SELLER DOES NOT RESPOND AFTER THE PRODUCT IS SOLD.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I have this app on all my devices. They did a great job and continue to do great improvements. I highly recommend it.
B000FVNX2Q|5.0|HP12C is particularly useful for almost any financial calculus, as mortgage amortization, NPV, bond prices/yields.  HP12C is considered a standard tool for every professional/practitioner/student in finance.  I do strongly recommend the Platinum version.    [...]
B005PW3OS8|5.0|This movie was much better than I expected.  The characters are excellent and nuanced, not just comic book cutouts.  The hero, for example, starts out being a physical weakling, but he has admirable heart and unstoppable determination.  When he becomes a physical superhero, the qualities that make you love him do not change; he just becomes a winner with much bigger obstacles to overcome.  Stanley Tucci's character is lovable and well played; this is my favorite of all the characterizations I've seen him in, and I feel his talent shines forth in this role.  It was sad that the character exited so early in the film, although the filmmakers managed to keep his spirit alive throughout the film, so he is not forgotten.  The action is outstanding, even for me; I am not particularly drawn to action films.  It keeps moving, and it is not just a rehash of all the action films you've seen before; it has a few interesting twists.  I also liked the hero's friend, although his character was not developed as much.  Visually, the movie is gorgeous, with a variety of scenery and excellent camera work.  The characters are more real and warm because of the way they are filmed, and the action is equally more riveting for the same reason.  Some of the scenes are breathtaking.  What really catapults a movie from mediocre to outstanding is how the characters are portrayed, and in this movie you care about the characters.  The ending is not a close-the-book-we're-done-forever ending, which suggests that they are already planning a sequel, and I am already planning to see it.
B0053YGYO4|1.0|Got this album in anticipation of listening while on a recent roadtrip.  Have enjoyed the band's other releases, but found this far from enjoyable.  Great cure for insomnia, but rock bottom on replay list.
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|Thank you amazon for this app! I've been wanting this for a very long time, only I didn't want to spend $15 on it. Amazon appstore rules.
B005JABSB6|1.0|Didn't work well at all, glasses kept cutting out while watching the TV in 3d mode (yes they were fully charged). Not sure if it's the glasses or the TV but they are both Sharp.
B000000Y87|5.0|This remarkable recording is exceptional in that the musical contributions from Evans, LaFaro (bass) and Montian (drums) blend elegantly amd seamlessly. However, there is still room to appreciate each man's instrument and style on it's own. Very rarely in studio, much less live recordings, is there such harmony from track-to-track yet distinctive music from each member. Having said this, it is LaFaro's bass that stands out especially in \\"Gloria's Step\\" (take 2) and \\"Alice in Wonderland\\" (take one). His presence and the bass influence is unmistable in every track. I don't know if we can attribute this to the performance or mastering of the recording, maybe both! Of course, LaFaro's play lends even greater intrigue as the album is forever linked to his untimely death days later. Whatever, just when you think you've heard one of the greatest bass players in jazz your blown away by a solo like that in \\"All Of You\\" (take 2). You then transition back into the give-and-take of this amazing trio with out competition but rather a unique naturalness. This is simply one of the greatest releases in the history of post World War II jazz.
B005WTR4ZI|4.0|\\"Race Against the Machine\\" presents a very cogent picture of both the economically beneficial and disruptive impacts of information and communication technology (ICT).  The authors make a great case that, with the ICT revolution, those whose jobs are eliminated as a result of rising technology will not necessarily be so easily able to find employment and to be absorbed into the economy, as it was in earlier major economic transformations like the industrial revolution.  It's a dangerous assumption that that will continue to be the case.  They also briefly mention that even the economic dislocation (the \\"race to the bottom\\") caused by globalization is itself a result of the ICT revolution, because globalization in its current form depends on communication networks and IT-based logistics.  Other reviewers have also mentioned \\"Lights in the Tunnel\\" as another work pointing out many of the same issues.  Both are worth reading, though I think \\"Race Against the Machine\\" is better written and documented, and employs much more easily digestible metaphors for understanding these matters.  Like some other reviewers, I was disappointed with the prescriptions for how society can cope with the rise of technology and the displacement of both unskilled and highly skilled human labor. I felt the same way about \\"Lights in the Tunnel\\". These prescriptions may generally be good -- I am not so sure about some -- but they seem far too weak to adequately cope with what this book indicates will inevitably be coming.  I think the authors have seriously underestimated the extent to which our economy and social institutions are ultimately going to have to be restructured to cope with the emerging realities.  They have also seriously underestimated the social disruption that is very likely going to be a part of that.  I think we are starting to see the beginnings of this already, with both the Tea Party and Occupy Wall Street.  A full appreciation of \\"Race Against the Machine\\" would suggest that these political movements may not be getting to the bottom of what is causing the very real pain that their members are experiencing.  With dislocation and increasing economic inequality ultimately caused by the effects of advancing technology and the resultant higher productivity, with increasing returns to capital, higher-skilled workers, and superstars, it should not be a surprise that those who are feeling the pain are looking for explanations and answers.  While I also believe that there does need to be increased government and corporate accountability, that money and politics need to be separated somehow (but how?), and that poverty, unemployment, health care, infrastructure, education, and many other urgent issues are not receiving the attention they deserve in the halls of power, I think this book does a much better job than most of explaining the true source of the structural economic problems we are beginning to encounter.   Somehow we are going to have to transform into a society in which everyone is able to participate and feel productive, to be rewarded for their efforts and contributions, and to be able without superhuman capabilities to obtain the purchasing power to meet their families' basic needs.  I don't know what that is going to look like but it seems that the current system is reaching some kind of failure point, and it seems to be in no small part because of the trends identified in \\"Race Against the Machine\\".    I do have one criticism of the production of the book:  I wish that they would have used more end-notes rather than hyperlinks, because as it is, the book is not really self-contained and so can't be fully appreciated unless read while online, and using the Kindle's web browser is not that much fun. It would be fine if the end-notes contained hyperlinks.
B004LZFWJO|1.0|I get it now.  Not much to it at all.  The little anoying wiggly icecream cone put me over the edge.  I never did find directions or a sound control.  I had my phone on mute, so maybe I missed the ice cream point?  It was movable to sd  card, but chose to uninstall.  kind of pointless to keep.  Gave it to my 4 year old to try just to get a second opinion.  Ihad the phone back in two mins:  The screen was also too small for her and neither one of could really tell exactly what we had under our fingers. NOT worth money, so install while free.
B004PHSTY8|5.0|Season 2 features some of my favorite episodes, including the classic 2 part finale. Watching this season definitely got me hooked on the series!
B005PW3OS8|1.0|There is no continuity in this movie, no explanations as to what is happening, just random action scenes. Add bad acting on top of that and very little character development aside from Captain America himself. The high ratings must be from fans of the comic book. Save your money and avoid this movie.
B001ECQ4AS|4.0|This is where the series starts, and what a great first season and pilot episode. Jared Padalecki and Jensen Ackles had immediate chemistry, and watching their relationship build is one of the pleasures of SPN. You also get Padalecki's auditioning reel, which shows he nailed it.
B000AM6OQ2|3.0|Well, it's not the viper, and if it is, he isn't there to vipe your vindows. It could be the fog and the death and destruction it brings. That is the theme of this movie--sort of. One hundred years earlier the good people of Antonio Bay, a seaside town on the west coast failed to keep their end of the bargain, allowing mariners to get shipwrecked on the rocks when they were supposed to provide the light for them in the safe direction. What they took from them was their treasure. The ghosts of the shipwreck set out to get even on the 100th anniversary of the town.<br /><br />The film features Janet Leigh,the town's mayor, her daughter Jamie Lee Curtis as a drifter and sex pot, Adrienne Barbeau as a disc jockey, sex pot, and mother of a young son, John Houseman, and Hal Holbrook playing a Catholic priest.<br /><br />The film provides plenty of chills while not quite getting anyone to the level of scream because each murder is preceded by a shroud of fog, several hard knocks on the door, a bit of fog coming in under the same, and a bright light that sounds like \\"roll on one\\" from the movie \\"The Green Mile.\\" You know it's coming. The victims usually fall prey when their \\"who's there?\\" doesn't get answered and they open the door anyway. But on behalf of the avenging ghosts, they are not deterred by locked doors. They will use their grappling hooks and blades to hack through walls and break windows of the unaccommodating.<br /><br />The film falters in a number of ways. The town celebrants seem more like sheep or obedient schoolchildren when asked to move from the bleachers to the next venue of the ceremony. If they are celebrating an anniversary I missed it. They are so quiet holding their candles, you'd think it was a memorial. A dead body seems to rise from the morgue slab for no apparent reason. No one else does. Adrienne Barbeau's sexy voice as a disc jockey could either arouse or put the listener to sleep, and Hal Holbrook, as Catholic priest finds clues of the murderers' bloody mission from a diary of the town's perfidy written by his father, the town's parish priest before him? This was obviously low budget.<br /><br />It's a good movie if you enjoy watching killer ghosts persist in getting their victims and narrow escapes. It is much better than the added effects of the 2005 version. Sometimes simple is much better but \\"Psycho\\" this isn't. At 62 cents you can't go wrong. The three or four dollars for shipping will be the killer. (Sorry, bad choice of words).<br /><br />Happy Halloween!diary of the town's perfidy written by his father, the town's parish priest before him? This was obviously low budget.

B00068NVI4|5.0|On Saturday May 15th 2004, Yes played the first of two shows at the Tsongas Arena which was taped by PBS' Soundstage. Since people have brought up sound quality as an issue, let's get that out of the way. Soundstage is PBS show in which most artists are brought into a studio environment (sound stage) with a very small amount of gear and play before a few hundred people (it's sort of like Unplugged but with electric instruments). The Yes Acoustic dvd is the perfect example of this as it was recorded on a sound stage in L.A.. This concert was NOT recorded on a sound stage but in a real concert hall in front of 8,000 people with the Soundstage crew trying to get what the band sounded like in the arena that night. This is not recorded straight from onstage mics, a mixing board or a multi track recording which allows for fixing it in the mix later on. The sound on here is not bad by any means but there are a couple of spots where there's a bit of echo and the like. This is a high definition recording of what Yes sounded like in the arena on this night.<br /><br />The show opens with a recording of Firebird Suite while the band assemble on the stage. Going For The One opens the show and this is the only part of the dvd where the sound is below par as the Yes crew try to get the sound dialed in. The second song is Sweet Dreams and it is played perfectly and the sound is clearly dialed in from the get go. I've Seen All Good People is well performed although Steve's guitar at the beginning could be a little louder but isn't that usually always the case. People are divided on Mind Drive but I love it and here it's first two parts drop us into a rocking South Side Of The Sky. Turn Of The Century is a wonderful performance. The cool My Eyes section of Footprints leads us into the final part of Mind Drive. The first set is wrapped up with a nice version of Yours Is No Disgrace. There's also a nice interview with Roger Dean in here too.<br /><br />The second half of the show opens with a Rick Wakeman solo, The Meeting Room, with Jon then coming out to join him on The Meeting. Then, the the rest of the band appears for a short stunning acoustic set featuring Long Distance Runaround, Wonderous Stories, Time Is Time, Roundabout, Show Me and Owner Of A Lonely Heart. I also like the fact that there's a bit of talking between the band members and to the audience during this short part of the show. Everyone seems in very good spirits. The second electric half resumes with Rhythm Of Love and the mix is a little harsh here but improves for the remainder of the show. And You And I is flawless while Ritual is a wonderful massive treat! For the enocores, we get a wonderful version of the rare Every Little Thing She Does dating all the way back to the band's beginning. Starship Trooper is a cool way to end the show.an solo, The Meeting Room, with Jon then coming out to join him on The Meeting.

It is funny, (given the accent of the bunny also) and cute and of course there's the element of fantasy that grabs you! Little, adorable talking Easter Bunny, it just doesn't get any better than that! Certainly is a feel good holiday movie for all.

B004SCN2F6|5.0|This game is fun, intriguing, and challenging.  The updates improved things a lot. My husband also plays and is more familiar with the rpg culture. He reads the blog and discussions associated with the game which has been very helpful. The developer has been very responsive to feedback. I am new to game playing and find it frustrating to have to research strategies extensively...probably because I'm busy in the rest of my life and I did not grow up playing video games.  Despite the frustration at times, I can't  stop playing and really enjoy star traders. Unfortunately amazon is behind on offering the updates, so you might want to buy this on Android market.
B0041KKYGA|5.0|Well, as opposed to some other reviewers, we actually saw the movie, and found it wonderful. It's a spectacular movie! It traces the story of Edward de Vere, Earl of Oxford, who actually wrote the Shakespeare plays but couldn't do it under his own name because earls weren't supposed to write plays for the masses in those days. It correctly points out that it was ridiculous to think that Will Shakespeare, a rural grain merchant, who had had a grade school education in a country town, could barely write, was allegedly almost illiterate, had never been to court and had no knowledge of court life, had never been abroad and presumably knew little of geography and knew no other language, could have written plays centering around court intrigues, foreign cities and customs (Romeo and Juliet,  Merchant of Venice, etc,), Roman History (Julius Caesar, etc), sprinkled with words of French, Latin and Italian. And no manuscript has ever been found in his handwriting. Give me a break!<br /><br />The acting and costumes and settings were superb. The plot was engaging and intriguing. Don't miss it.

B00000612P|5.0|Rod Stewart is and most certainly was an interesting guy. Known later more for his lifestyle and constant string of model wives than his musical significance; he began the 70's with the potential to be one of the greatest artists ever. His unique voice and look made him a prefect 70's rock icon. After making his debut in the Jeff Beck Group he went on to join The Faces taking over for another gravelly voiced singer named Steve Marriott who went on to form Humble Pie with Peter Frampton but that's another story. The Faces also had guitarist and good buddy Ron Wood who later would go on to replace Mick Taylor in the Rolling Stones but again, that's another story. At this time Stewart started a parallel solo career with several releases prior to his biggest hit to date....1971's \\"Every Picture Tells a Story\\". If for no other reason this album is great because it contains the iconic \\"Maggie May\\"; Stewart's signature song. But, it shows the singer's broad range of musical style with more rockin' numbers like the title track and one of the best covers ever \\"I Know I'm Losing You\\" originally by R&B group The Temptations. The album also showcases Stewart's talent to take more folksy material like \\"Seems Like a Long Time\\" and \\"Reason to Believe\\" and make them into his own unique interpretations.   I think the fact that Stewart was in The Faces at this time kept him from going off the musical rails (more pop, disco and basically trying to constantly find his musical niche) like he did once they split up and he was free to do whatever suited him. In my opinion, the original songs and the covers he chooses here and on the almost as good follow up, \\"Never a Dull Moment\\" are the high points of Stewart's career. The Faces studio records came out between 1970 and 1973 and it's no coincidence that his most meaningful solo work is in the same period. Stewart put out many records from 1973 on to this day but none was as consistent or had the high quality of \\"Every Picture\\". It's a shame that he later chose style over substance and abandoned what could have been a stellar musical legacy.
1594744475|5.0|I purchased this book as my first effort at bento boxes and it is excellent. It doesn't just give ideas, tips, and recipes for your bento creations it supplies recipes for the tasty tid-bits you'll have tucked in with the rice and veggies. It suggests supplies, boxes, patterns, techniques, plus recipes for lots of little things you can combine freestyle. Highly recommended for both the experienced and inexperienced bento enthusiast ^^ good luck!
0670022411|3.0|It was a decent book. I wouldn't say it was bad, but it wasn't overly exciting or original either. It would be a good beach read: something easy and fun.
0553801473|1.0|I must confess that I really enjoyed the first three books of this series. I was disappointed with this book as well as its predecessor. They were mostly filler and history lessons. I kept reading this book because I was attached to Snow (The only main character with a sense of honor). After I finished it I regretted deeply the hours of my life that were wasted on book that didn't deserve them. This book feels more like a horror flick: crude and pointless violence with no depth.

B000O8OTNC|4.0|After receiving my Smith's PP1 Pocket Pal, I have been going around the house sharpening every knife that I came in contact with. It was a breeze sharpening stainless steel knives. What shocked me was that the Pocket Pal was able to sharpen my Cutco knives. For those of you who have heard of Cutco, you should know that the blades (440c stainless steel) on these knives are one of the hardest to sharpen. However, with a few passes through the \\"carbide\\" slot, and then follow with the \\"ceramic\\" slot...my knives took an edge.<br /><br />I highly recommend this Pocket Pal to anyone that's looking for something easy to sharpen with.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Buy this album. No matter what else you may like in terms of rock and roll, music lovers should own this album. If you do not own any other example of their work, buy \\"How The West Was Won\\", Led Zeppelin. It's a powerful, clear example of live rock and roll, Zeppelin-style, that was mind-blowing in 1972 and even more so today. Thanks to Jimmy Page for taking time to search archival material for the Led Zeppelin DVD he found the recordings for performances presented in \\"How The West Won\\" and decided to share.    I consider myself a Zeppelin aficiado. I have every album. I started listening to the mighty Zep when I was 12 years old. I had my mom's 8-track \\"Physical Graffiti\\" as my best friend every day after school. I cried the day I came home flipped on the radio for a change of pace and heard the annoucer saythat John Bonham died; I  had just turned 13 that month. It was truly a sad moment. I was never going to witness them in person. I was devastated, but found solace listening to their music all these years. I named my first daughter Kashmir. She was concieved listening to that song one wintry day in January 1988.    My son bought me this album and gave it to me as a Christmas present a few years ago. It's the best I've ever heard. This album is by far the finest, most raw example of their work since the BBC sessions in the early 1960's. \\"How the West Was Won\\" should be part of any Led Zeppelin fans' collection. I still cry sometimes, but it's for joy that Led Zeppelin existed and rocks this planet. Thanks for letting me share my thoughts with you.
B005HQ5S3G|4.0|\\"Stronger\\" is the perfect title for this new album because Kelly is back and yes, stronger than ever. Her voice seems to get better with each release and on \\"Stronger\\"  they stripped away most of that reverb and auto-tune effect that plagued quite a few of her previous records. What you are left with is certainly one of the greatest voices of our time.   There is a great blend of music on this album from anthem songs such as \\"What Doesn't Kill You\\" to more serious tracks such as \\"Breaking Your Own Heart\\". A more mature Kelly that is ready for the next decade of her career. 4/5 stars because there is always room to grow.

Touching on Pink Floyd' \\"The Wall\\", the Smashing Pumpkins' double album and some of Anthony Gonzales' favorite classical composers, while placing you right in the thick of an 80's movie; ex. \\"48 hours\\".  Surely an album people will listen to 100 years from now.  With 10 weeks to go in 2011, I find it hard to believe a better album, excuse me, double album will drop.  #AOTY

1439102732|4.0|Jodi Picoult is well-known for writing about current issues, issues you might see in the headlines of today's newspapers, magazines or blogs - and she is especially good about choosing controversial storylines.<br /><br />The protagonist of \\"Sing You Home\\" is Zoe, a musical therapist.  She plays her guitar and sings for people that need music in their lives - the dying, burn victims, stroke patients, troubled youth.<br /><br />This is a story of love, wanting children, inner demons, overcoming adversity, same-sex marriage and rights, religious issues and more.  Picoult is a phenomenal writer and sympathetically explores the many sides of questions raised in this book.  I guess that one complaint I have about the book is that, while the characters are well-drawn and developed, they are stereotypical.  But I guess that is where the word \\"stereotype\\" comes from - perceptions by a large percentage of the populace.<br /><br />A music CD was included with the book with lyrics written by Picoult and music written and performed by Ellen Wilber.  Charts were shown throughout the music, showing which track to listen to at that point in the story.  The lyrics and music were pleasant but not as hard-hitting as the prose.

I've listened to it 3 times, I don't think there will be a fourth.  The best song on here (not sure I can pick one out of this mess actually) would be by far the worst song on Remainder or Let it die.  I gave it 2 stars because its not PAINFUL to listen to (except \\"a commotion\\" one of the worst songs ever), but there is nothing enjoyable here.
B000FC1AGG|4.0|Real life can be tough enough so Sophie Kinsella's sweet and amusing tale was, for me, a welcomed diversion.  It's not easy to find some light-hearted fare these days.  Non-fiction selections can be full of doom and gloom and it seems that anyone with a miserable upbringing feels compelled to publish a disturbing memoir.  Fiction offerings too are dark and tragic.  Honestly, can't anyone find anything happy to write about these days?  Well, Ms. Kinsella has and I wholeheartedly thank her for that.  I thought the premise of the airplane turbulence causing sweet Emma to blurt out her innermost secrets to the stranger sitting next to her was a clever catalyst to set the wheels in motion for this fun little love story.  It's a quick and easy read with an endearing heroine.  You'll chuckle at her and be mortified with her as the story unfolds.  I kept picturing and hearing British actress Emily Mortimer as Emma...attention Hollywood casting!  So, brew yourself a cup of tea, grab a scone and sit back and enjoy this easy-going and amusing read.  What can ever be wrong with a little harmless fun?
B004S3MB2U|5.0|For many years I used Calc98 on my Pocket PCs.  It was able to do just about everything, and when I switched to Android, I sorely missed it.  There just wasn't anything even remotely similar available.  Until now.<br /><br />NeoCal Advanced isn't just a scientific calculator.  It's also a financial calculator, a statistical calculator, a programmer's calculator, a unit converter and a date and time calculator.  It can operate in order-entered, precedence, or RPN mode.  You can switch between calculators in mid-entry, so you can, for instance, type in a hexadecimal number, perform a trigonometric function, then store the result for statistical work.<br /><br />It looks nice as well, and the layouts are customizable.  It works great on both my Evo 3D and my Xoom tablet.<br /><br />The only down side is the $10 price tag, but you'd pay that for a basic hardware scientific calculator, and considering it's 6 calculators in one, it's worth the money.

B004LZFWJO|1.0|This app clearly isn't designed for high resolution displays.  On my Evo 3D, the game filled only a fraction of the screen, while on my Xoom tablet, it did fill the screen but the candy pieces were tiny, smaller than my pinky-nail, and very far apart.  The small pieces made the game much more difficult: on the Evo I couldn't see what was under my fingers, while on the Xoom it's impossible to scan the whole board at a glance.<br /><br />Several times while playing it would highlight a piece clear across the board with no obvious connection to where I was swiping; while I appreciate the extra points, this is obviously a bug.<br /><br />Gameplay is simple, yet rather addictive.  It's hard to force yourself to quit in the middle of the game.  Alas, while the game can go on for a very long time, there's no way to save your place, so if you're forced to switch away from the app, you'll lose all your progress and have to start over.<br /><br />While it's a decent, though not at all spectacular, time killer game, the $3 price tag is about three times what it should be.

Then you start getting comparisons with people like Kate Bush, Tori Amos and PJ Harvey then you know the pressure for your second record is going to be massive so it's a good thing Florence and The Machine deliver big time on album number two and along the way add more strings, guitars and heavier drums and even some more epic songs.  Anybody who heard \\"What The Water Gave Me\\" been performed back in May 2010 would back up that the second album would be great, at close to six minutes the song takes the listener on an epic journey as it begins hauntingly slowly before building into a big climax that features guitar, harp and drums all in perfect harmony. The first official single \\"Shake It Out\\" with it's pounding drums and gentle organ and features a great repetitive chorus that sounds louder than any Sunday Choir! On \\"No Light, No Light\\" it starts out real soft before those familiar pounding drums come pounding again.  \\"Breaking Down\\" begins with a sound of a drum machine and finds Florence Welch singing in a different tone it sounds like something from the 80's given a fresh make over, it even fittingly has a break down towards the end. \\"Seven Devils\\" sounds hauntingly like Kate Bush and even the music sounds erie, like it could have been used in a horror or thriller movie. There is so many fine songs on the album the likes of \\"Lover To lover\\", opener \\"Only If For A Night\\" which sets the tone nicely for the album. On \\"Spectrum\\" the song includes Florence singing over a big dance beat before a breakdown in the middle which features gentle sounding strings, the two sounds work well together.  The deluxe edition features a few new tracks as well as demos and acoustic versions of \\"Heartlines\\", \\"Shake It Out\\" and \\"Breaking Down\\". The demo version of \\"What The Water Gave Me\\" is a more beat orientated version. The 3 extra tracks are all worth having and if you're a Florence And The Machine fan then you will want the deluxe edition.  Paul Epworth is once again on production duties as well as songwriting with Welch herself and keyboardist Isabella Summers. \\"Ceremonials\\" is a great second album to follow debut \\"Lungs\\" and one in which features plenty of standout tracks. There is no second album syndrome here!

0143034901|5.0|A close friend recommended this novel to me.  She said, \\"I've given it away so many times and reread it so many times.  I'll need to ask you to give this novel back when you are finished.\\"  These types of introductions to novels always seem to be a disclaimer for the equation that someone loved a novel that I could care little for.  However in the event of The Shadow of the Wind- this was untrue.  For once, I agreed with a friend upon recommending a novel.<br /><br />Perhaps it is my love for reading, or my love for Spanish culture or my curious nature about things that go bump in the night, whatever the drive -this book hit a nerve.  At the book's roots, it is a story about love: the love of reading and the various forms of love that one finds in their lives.<br />The protagonist is believable- though only a teenage boy and wise beyond his years.  The plots revolves around a book within a book and a mystery withing each character solving a mystery of self discovery.  Each sentence in the novel builds a hunger and fire for lighting the way to reveal something more about the protagonist and his search for a mysterious author.<br /><br />Though I will admit, I did not enjoy this book as much as others while I was reading it.  After I finished, it felt like I finished an intense race where I felt tired but overwhelmed in the knowledge that the story was one of the more fascinating stories I have read in my young adult life.<br /><br />I finished the novel a few weeks ago and thought about returning it to my friend Sara.  However, I may hang onto it for another race to read it.  I'll just tell Sara that I need a few more weeks with it.

B00003CXAW|5.0|Purchased for our grandson who watched our copy of King Kong for the first time and thought it was great.  He loved the lost spider pit sequence on the second disc.  He will be watching this movie a lot of times.  The order came quickly and the disc is in perfect condition.  As always Amazon is the place to go for classic movies.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this book and found the storyline wonderful. I loved how the world of vampires where build to where they are known more and to some level accepted.

B001O9AQXC|5.0|Three quarters through my first viewing of The Reader, I realized it's complexity - and, upon reflection, my understanding grew. I now use the movie (not enough time for the book)in my doctoral graduate leadership classes. I'll offer hints at what we cover (you have to take the course for more) concerning \\"leadership\\" here, via inquiry:  1. What happens when an illiterate society is exposed to a diabolical but charismatic leader? (Hint, 1940's Germany)  2. To what lengths will illiterate people go to hide their illiteracy? (Hint, Hannah's prison term)  3. After an illiterate society has followed a diabolical leader to ruin, to what lengths will it go to assuage the pain and humilation? (Hint: Statutory Rape, Manipulation of Youth, etc.)   4. What will be the reaction of a rescued, literate socity as it gains sophitication and maturity (Hint, look in Ralph's eyes)  5. What will save the ruined, illiterate society (Hint, suicide)and the new [somwhat tarnished, but re-newed], literate society? (Hint, acknowledgement, self-forgiveness and dilligence)  Thanks to the other reviewers for poinient, valid comments, and hopefully, others will join me in thinking about this symbolic story.  Dr. R
B004LROUNG|5.0|Over the years, I have enjoyed Grisham's novels, and already read about fourteen of them, so I was looking forward reading The Litigators. Well, I'm not going to write a full review of the book, but let me just say that this one is perhaps one of the best three Grisham novels I have read, so don't hesitate, just buy it and immerse yourself in a world full of endearing characters.   As a side note not related to the book, I'm considering going back to buying my beloved paper books instead of Kindle ones. E-books sometimes priced higher than a hardcover? It's simply ridiculous!
B0055V6EZE|5.0|Anyone who enjoys Laurie on \\"House\\" and knows he is English realizes that he is a master of the American accent.  This recording further proves it!  On the various songs he uses not just one accent may many different voices.  It's almost as if he's acting the performers' parts - this is not meant in any way to be negative.  Perhaps he heard the varied sounds of earlier singers and emulates them -I don't know but it is great!  Currently I'm alternating listening to this and [[ASIN:B005DZMODI Wynton Marsalis & Eric Clapton Play The Blues]]. Check it out, too.
B004LZFWJO|1.0|this free app is great.  I have this new uninstaller I wanted to test and this is a great place to start.
B00003CXCW|5.0|This is a classic in very good condition, I was happy with it overall.<br /><br />The film is about Joe who becomes ensnared by a forgotten silent film star actress into becoming her kept man and his only other options were limited, like becoming a paper boy selling newspapers. In fact it starts off with him lying in the luxorious pool, apparently drowned, and starts with him narrating everything, although he is deceased.<br /><br />The taste of this story is about Hollywood looking back on itself, with the history at the time of this being made or released it was only about 22 years after the end of the silent film era. There is great acting and there were Academy Awards won for Best Actor, Best Actress and Best Motion Picture. It is worth it for the place it holds in history, the dialogue and scenes make it both funny at times and dramatic. Recommend...
B005PMNBPY|5.0|I never got into Jane's Addiction when they were in their \\"prime\\" but I really like this album. It has a nice mix of atmospheric sounds, cool guitars, bass rhythms, melodies, and some great drums. I gave it a quick preview thinking that I'd probably hate it but after hearing the first few songs I was hooked. Great album!
B005HS00ZU|1.0|Freaking BORING!!! What has happened to Peter Gabriel? I guess the good old days of \\"So\\" are over. Regret making this purchase. Who knows, maybe I'll enjoy it one day... When I'm INSANE!!!!
B004X8W468|4.0|Rebecca's Stead's charming little book, When You Reach Me, is the story of a sort-of-geeky preteen girl named Miranda (who happens to be obsessed with Madeline L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time) , her former best friend Sal, her new friends, her game-show contestant mother and a crazy, laughing homeless man.  Oh yeah, and it's about time travel.  One day, on their walk home from school, Miranda's best friend Sal gets punched in the face by a kid named Marcus and then decides that he doesn't want to be friends with Miranda anymore and starts to ignore her.  She is forced to expand her social circle and this (traditional narrative) part of the book accurately captures what seems to happen to tomboys as they grow into teenagers.  Miranda is experiencing the intricacies of female friendship and her first inklings of crush.  At the same time, she finds herself caught up in a strange mystery when she finds notes alluding to aspects of her life that would be impossible for the writer of the notes to know about.  Did I mention there is time travel in the book? And there are echoes of Daniel Pinkwater (for me at least).  Overall, I found the book entertaining and whimsical, not the best I've read this year, but certainly a lovely Sunday afternoon read.
6304498969|5.0|In this intimate little concert, Eric Clapton shows why he is a legendary guitarist. Great song selection. Incredible musicianship. This is Clapton playing what he loves. Blues. When you watch it, you feel you're in the front row. Video is very good. Surround sound is very good. Even if you're not a big EC fan, you'll love this show.
B001UV4XJ2|1.0|Ultraviolet is another feeble, doomed attempt by some dinosaur brain Hollywood execs to restrict the use of your legally bought digital purchase.

B00005JO1R|5.0|The way this film starts out and how it chronicles the life of one of my favorite performers is really good and turns out to be better than I had thought it would be at first.<br /><br />It follows as Johnny Cash starts out and progresses to where he was in Vegas and after a show, June caught him taking his pills and then she started regretting her involvement thinking him to be addicted, as it would turn out after that night's show, he took too many and something happened and he passed out, then all of that leads to him going to Mexico and as he looks for more medication and turns out to be a dramatic trip that changes the way he relates to his own performances and his fans.<br /><br />The acting here is terrific and I have been impressed, Reese Witherspoon won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress along with many other recognitions, and Vivian and June's roles are both played extremely well and contributed to making this film as enjoyable as it I found it to be. Recommend.

B005PMNBPY|2.0|Much like their last effort, strays, this album is okay but not even close in comparison to their earlier brilliance.  If you are a hard-core janes fan, like myself, you are going to pick it up anyway in the hopes of finding at least one or two tracks that bring back the magic of their fist couple albums.  Unfortunately you won't find it on this album.  I've had it on my ipod for a couple weeks now and despite forcing myself to give it a chance by listening to it multiple times in the hope that it will grow on me, it has not.  It's not that the album is bad, Perry's vocals are great as usual and Dave's guitar is stellar, but there are just no memorable tracks.    If they are going to continue to put out so-so albums like this, I would much prefer another Kettle whistle type album where they play fan favorites live with a sprinkling of new material.
1400032717|4.0|The narrator of Mark Haddon's book, The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, is in the tradition of the unreliable narrator; the difference is that this narrator- Christopher John Francis Boone- is incapable of untruth. He is unreliable only because his view of the world is different than the average person's and this unique view is a result of his Asperger's Disorder (a form of high functioning autism).  The mystery plot of the novel is put into motion when Christopher finds his neighbor's dog, dead on the lawn, stabbed with a fork.  In the tradition of his favorite Sherlock Holmes stories, Christopher makes it his mission to find the murderer, and as a result, finds himself going on a much larger adventure than he could have anticipated.  Christopher's narrative voice is unique and engaging.  He reveals aspects of the world that most of us fail to see.  Although the book is sometimes bittersweet, it is a worthwhile, and often fun novel that would make a great summer read.
0385342039|1.0|Nope.  Did not like this one. I bought can you keep a secret and loved it. The next day I bought remember me and loved it more. Now this book was ridiculous. I just read it this morning. I don't understand what people liked about it. The heroine can't make it in the world without help from a ghost. She is just a big fake. Ed does not seem real. No character development.  Waste of money.
B005AAVFDQ|4.0|Overall, I'm very happy with this release.  I've now had time to listen to all the CD's, watch the DVD and go through the book and am happy with my purchase.  Having all of the demos, the early studio sessions, and the original Vig mixes are awesome.  If you're looking at this product, you're obviously not the casual fan so my reviewing \\"Nevermind\\" will have little value.  Instead, I'll discuss my overall feeling about each disc, the deficiencies of each disc, and the release as a whole as a way for you to decide if spending over $100 is really worth it to you...  Disc 1 - Original Album (remastered) + B-sides - I like the remaster for the most part, but to me the parts of the song with crunchy guitar almost seem to be turned up too loud in the mix, to the point where they break out of the field of a sound a bit, if that makes sense.  Kurts guitar in Come As You are (not the solo) seems turned up too much in the mix also.  Disc 2 - The Smart Studio Sessions, The Boombox Rehearsals, BBC Sessions - Great disc with great quality early studio sessions and demos.  This disc is awesome for getting a look at the creation of the Nevermind material from rehearsals, to early studio sessions, to a pair of early live performances.  Disc 3 - The Devonshire Mixes - Definitely an interesting CD and I love rockin' it.  There are mostly minor differences in the sound and mix.  An interesting document of the first draft of the completed album.  For me, the On A Plain mix was the coolest of the different mixes, I loved the sound, especially the mix on Kurts vocals and the outro.  This is a cool way to listen to the CD with more variety in the sound.  Disc 4 - Live at the Paramount CD - An excellent live concert with a ton of material - 19 tracks in all.  Each song is played incredibly and Kurts vocals are right on.  Incredible sound and performance all around.  Disc 5 - Live at the Paramount DVD - The 16mm film makes watching this concert much more interesting than the normal \\"concerton DVD.\\"  Kurt knocking down the mic stand during a song, and breaking his guitar at the end are cool as well.  This could easily have been released as a theatrical release.  Krist's statement \\"White boy funk sucks!\\" is also funny.  Having the 4 videos from the album are also awesome to have together with the concert.  The Book - The book has high quality color pictures of the band during the time of the recording and promoting the album including pics of the infamous pool photo shoot, with the band in the pool.  There are lyrics, expense reports, pictures of singles released, magazine articles, pics of the music video shoots, etc.  Very thorough, color picture heavy book.  So here's what I would say are the main deficiencies...  #1 - Price - This was outrageously expensive.  You can get the first two discs and the concert on DVD for right under $40.  For The extra $70 I paid, I got the Devonshire mixes (Disc 3), a poster, and the book.  Give a fair value of $15 to the Devonshire disc, and $5 to the poster, and you're looking at $50 for the book.  The book is really nice but $50?  It's also worth noting Anyone reading this is certainly going to pay more than $110 like I did because they're limited to 40,000 worldwide and have sold out so now you're going to be buying from a re-seller.  #2 - Remaster Of Original Album - Definitely wish the original album would have had a touch more care put into the remastering job - minor gripe.  #3 - Missing \\"Song In D\\" - Why this song was excluded on this $100+ \\"Super Deluxe\\" album is beyond me.  It's an unreleased Nevermind sessions instrumental.  Vig and Grohl were recently joking around about the fact that the song was not included on this set, and Grohl laughingly said \\"Sounds like another box set!\\"  This 5 disc release of the original \\"single disc\\" album and they leave off that one instrumental?  Uncool in my opinion.  I certainly hope they don't make us poor fans buy another $100+ set to get that one song in the future.  #4- Packaging - This set is highly prone to smudges and fingerprints and seems to have a horrible reaction to the oil on human skin.  I've already put a few smudges that won't come off on the case and have to wash my hands before handling the set each time.  I ripped all of the music from the CD's to high quality 320kbps mp3s so that I don't have to open it and mess with it all the time.  Also, the CD's are slid into cardboard cutouts in the book, which is guaranteed to scratch the discs if you take them out more than a few times, regardless of how careful you are.  The case is basically the exact size of a square record sleeve but is a little over an inch thick.  If you're a product of the 90s (like me) and don't have storage for LP's, storing it can be a bit awkward.  These four issues make me drop a star to a 4 out of 5 rating, which is accurate for my level of satisfaction.  I would never give mine up now that I have it and I love this set!  The positives easily outweigh the negatives here and having official versions of all this highly bootlegged material is awesome to both benefit the artists, and get higher quality versions of this material.  I can smell a similar release in a couple of years for In Utero, which I look forward to.  Rock On!  Chris Elliott
B0042U94UQ|1.0|Well, the first half of the movie should have been redone. [Or at least left on the editing floor.] The second half has humor and some sentiment but, I am hard pressed to see it's merits for children or even adults of a childish nature. You really need characters to whom one can be relate or are at least recognizable in some imaginary life. Same thing for the antagonist.  I have seen more dimension in a single blank sheet of paper. The underlying story of the hard hearted bad guy going soft over the helpless guiless child, needed a lot more development, that it did not get.  Whoever did the little yellow guys got it.  The director didn't, in my opinion.  If you get it half price and skip through the first half, then you might get your money's worth.
B004LZFWJO|4.0|This app is the best ever. Who would not want this app especially with the $2.99 savings! It was a lot of fun to use and I really enjoyed the different levels.
B004EBUXSA|5.0|I am extremely happy with my new Core i7 2600K and would highly recommend it to anyone looking for a decently priced, high performance CPU.  I mainly work in Microsoft Office 2010 now, but have programming experience and CAD experience and this processor comes in handy for the highly multithreaded applications.  I haven't yet pushed the limits of the processor, but I am sure I will with the computer work I do.  As a note, currently the new Core i7's with 6 cores are coming out and promise to offer even more performance, however, at $300 bucks for the 2600K I recommend it.  I was able to OC from 3.4GHZ to 4.2GHZ just on the factory stock cooler with no problem.  I'm sure I could push it further, but I do not need the extra power currently.
073935650X|3.0|Jay Asher's book is having a real moment right now, and I know that I am in the minority when I say that I didn't really like it.  I find the concept of the book- a series of tapes left behind by Hannah after committing suicide, explaining to all of the negative forces in her life how they have impacted her- to be intriguing, and the book did have emotional weight.  Asher attempts to show that suicide isn't the result of a single incident or event, but that the culmination of small things has a big effect.  This is an important message in the era of cyberbullying, and it is a good message for all of us to be cautious and considerate of what we say and do unto others.  However, I think that it continues to be reductive to suggest that someone who commits suicide can trace back every moment that led to the event.  This may be true for some, but not all sufferers of depression.  And just on a storytelling level (and I've read this elsewhere), I didn't really believe in the characters.  Clay- the narrator- seemed like more of a device than a fully developed character.  He didn't need to be the vehicle to tell Hannah's story, and I think that her story would have been more powerful if she had just been allowed to tell it herself, without the cleverness of the device that frames it.
B0057L03EK|5.0|I think this is their best album ever. I've always been kind of iffy on LB... I('ve) like(d) some of their stuff (over the years) but not all of it (Nookie and the Unquestionable Truth EP/LP being the stand-outs)... However with this album, the group is in their thirties now and you can tell that the sound has matured and the album is cohesive.
0738711500|5.0|When I first got the package, the first thing I did (naturally) was pull out the cards and look at each one. They're beautifully illustrated and they all evoked emotional responses in me. They sort of lack the ancient type of mysteriousness that more traditionally illustrated cards have, but I found them more evocative and pleasant to use, although I must admit this is the first deck I've seriously attempted to use. They're sleek and shiny and there's quite a bit of subtlety in their imagery, beneath their less subtle beauty.  As for the book, I followed its suggestions and methods step by step and found it to be an excellent way to learn the Tarot. The most notable thing is that it recommends that you keep a Tarot journal and fill it up with information about each card before you even attempt to do your first reading. This seemed slightly tedious, but I'm really glad I did it. When I did my first reading, all of the cards immediately made sense to me, and I didn't even have to look in the book to interpret them. I felt like I was fluent in the language of the Tarot. My first reading very clearly told me that I'm going to Germany! :)  I promised a caveat, so here it is. Much of the book assumes that the Tarot is in fact magical. You will see suggestions such as charging a quartz crystal with energy and sleeping with the deck under your pillow. If you do not believe in any of this, you may find much of the book silly. My suggestion to you, if you are one of these people, is to wipe out any preconceived notions, and go along with the book's methods. Assume that the Tarot is magical and designate your time with the Tarot as a time when belief in the insistences of modern science is suspended. I think you will have a more rewarding experience if you do this.  Even if you can't do that, the book is still mostly information about what each card is traditionally considered to mean, what the reading procedure entails, information about different crosses, and et cetera, so the book is still definitely quite valuable. And this package (deck + book) seems to be cheaper than most decks for sale anyhow.  Happy divining!
B000002VFW|5.0|This album continues to stand the test of time. In 1990 Lisa Stansfield came in like a whirlwind with - All around the World, This Is The Right Time, You Can't Deny It - as the major hits with great success in the clubs and all around but you can play this cd end-to-end today and it remains timeless,fresh and great to listen to. It continues to holds it own as a true classic. To me, Miss Stansfield never released another album to equal `Affection' but I'm always happy to pop this into the cd player and give it a listen and marvel at how really good it all still sounds.

B005IZLPME|1.0|I fell asleep on the movie.  I just kept saying I know that this movie is going to get better.  It never got better.  What about the 3D.  Even 3D can normally make a movie worth it.  I wish I had saved the $26.  Yes, I bought the 3D Combo at Amazon.  If I could return it, I would.  I love action and superhero movies in 3D.  I even love the Final Destination series because of the 3D and I don't seem to mind the acting or the fact that I always know how it will turn out.  This movie was a bit different.  Since I got the 3D TV there is very little content.  I have been collecting movies.  After purchasing a few movies that I did not like (Sanctum and The Nightmare Before Christmas), I thought that maybe I should stick to action films.  I really liked Drive Angry, Thor, and Green Lantern.  This one was was not all that good (acting, action, and 3D).  I would rent it if I could on Vudu.

B005DKLPF6|5.0|Amazing album. I've been listening to Mastodon since the release of Blood Mountain. I don't know if I like this album more than Crack The Skye or not, all of their albums are so different it's hard to compare. I'll definitely be giving it more listens. The two songs that I would say are probably my favorite Mastodon songs are \\"All The Heavy Lifting\\" and \\"Creature Lives\\" I love it when Brann sings!.   Definitely worth checking out.

B005RUV6RO|1.0|Same looking and acting zombies we've seen for decades. What a ripoff unless you like seeing the same scene of a zombie being shot or whacked over and over and over again. How exciting.   Unimaginative ripoff of every apocalyptic movie ever done as well as every zombie flick (scenes taken directly from 28 Days/Weeks) ever done with robotic, read the inane dialogue script line by line topped off with the worst torn clothing, fake blood, strewn paper and obviously placed cars to look abandoned and that really look obviously placed. Whew!   Then add the tiresome people that are hiding but then act stupidly suspicious at the wrong times; the redundant raiding of department stores; the usual military has a safe haven; the tiresome search for survivor groups. The, by-the-way, Who decades ago thought up the zombie walk?, since it makes no anatomical sense but at least in this TV series they actually run which also makes no sense when they can barely walk the rest of the time.   There must be a segment of the population that is zombie TV transfixed that recognizes kin in this tripe. Bon appétit.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I had played this at a friends house and it was a must have for my own,  We have played it since receiving it 2 weeks ago, and it is of the highest quality contruction.
B00006GEB4|4.0|The Pros: The package came in a timely manner, and was very easy to open, thanks to amazon. Every song on the album is great (which is why I decided to order the vinyl).   The Cons: Unfortunately, the vinyl came very warped. I don't know if it happened during transport or what, but it is warped visually. It is still playable, but the tone arm travels about .5-.75 inches vertically when it plays the warped section. It isn't so bad that the needle jumps, but I can hear a slight slur. For this reason I cannot give this the 5 star rating I'd like to.
B004LZFWJO|2.0|I like the diagonal connection ability, but that is about all I like about this game. The graphics are lame, and the sound is annoying. The gameplay area does not make good use of the screen so there is a lot of dead space. This game needs some major polish.<br /><br />Playing is tedious rather than fun.<br /><br />And yeah, not all the items are candy. Should be called SweetSwipe instead - get some alliteration there.<br /><br />This game is possibly worth 99 cents for the rare person who seems to enjoy this game, but certainly not worth $2.99 at this stage of development. For me, this game isn't worth keeping even for free.

B005I64U34|1.0|A great movie pays attention to detail; does it background research; treats it's audience in an intelligent manner.   Verdict: F for a failing grade on all points and studio is relegated back to middle school. Incidentally the identical version of this story made a few years back was better in all respects except CGI.  (1.) Cheap Science: Every so often a cheap movie comes along that makes the same 1950s sci-fi mistakes such as: multiple large planets in close proximity would create such massive gravitational forces that all of them should have been ripped apart; there is no fire in space or on oxygenless planets; no sound in the vacuum of space; wormholes do not look like subway tunnels; the time to travel to a distant star's planet would be unimaginable besides being physically impossible as shown; greatest force in the Universe is not \\" green will\\" but negative or dark energy.  (2.) Cheap sci-fi: Aliens with eyebrows/eyelashes; aliens with Spock ears; usual reptile aliens; aliens with green will energy as personal space ships but also needing cheap plastic space ship that just so happens to crash in water next to a beach; names like Parallax that sound scientific but have no meaning in this context; usual alien craggy mountains that look suspiciously like Earth; usual enormous high tech lab behind sliding massive doors inside some derelict warehouse.   (3.) Cheap acting/script/props: Actually no acting just eye candy for the masses; usual romantic subplot again to draw in a certain demographic ID'd consumer; quick and cheap script that is overburdened with cliché; cheaply constructed model airplane dogfight in green screen canyon that's been done many times before.
B005LAJ1O0|5.0|I was pretty OVER the crap on TV these days, with the limited few shows I like.. But then this came along.  And I have something to look forward to on Wednesdays at 10.  I haven't PLANNED to watch an episode of a TV show in AGES.  It's about time!<br /><br />It's also brilliantly done-- it's quirky, a little funny, definitely spooky, and make you jump at times-- Not to mention it's wicked sexy!  One twist after another.  Only four episodes in, and I'm HOOKED.  Give me this show intravenously, I'm addicted to American Horror Story.
B005KMX866|5.0|ALWAYS A FAN OF CHRIS ISAAK, THIS MUSIC SHOWS HIS GREAT VOICE.  MUSICIANS ARE EXCELLENT.  GREAT OLDIES BROUGHT BACK TO LIFE.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|Probably not since, dare I say, those lads from Liverpool burst onto the scene all those years ago. Not to place Coldplay on the same Heavenly peak as the greatest band in the history of music, but the pre-Rubber Soul Beatles were derided by many critics in their early years for being too pop oriented, yet those songs have stood the test of time because of their undeniable craftsmanship, danceableness, and their sheer infectiousness and joyful enthusiasm; and, Coldplay have managed to capture that joyfulness and that infectious spirit with Mylo Xyloto, albeit with a modern twist.  Jonny Buckland, Will Champion, Guy Berryman, and Chris Martin have conjured a magic trick: I despised \\"Every Teardrop Is A Waterfall\\" and \\"Major Minus\\" and thought they were absolute garbage upon their initial release back in June; but, now, since they fit perfectly within the context of the album, I love them; and they have grown on me more than any songs I've heard by any band. Jonny's sublime guitar on the former and Guy's stellar bass on the latter more than justify each track's existence (and they're the two weakest songs on the album!).  You can tell a ton of thought and hard work went into the making of this album. It's like one big love song to their fans and one giant flipping of the bird to all the cynical, miserable naysayers. The band has forged an epic and kaleidoscopic sound that doesn't feel derivative or forced or contrived (grandiosity for grandiosity's sake), like their previous two efforts. Since Coldplay started out with the intention of making a stripped-down, acoustic album, the songs were able to grow organically and blossom into the ones gracing our ear drums today. When I first heard they were going to make an acoustic album with shades of Parachutes, I said, \\"Finally!.\\" So I was upset to say the least when I learned otherwise and the aforementioned two tracks were released. But my misgivings have been assuaged and then some.  The first half of the album plays likea greatest hits compilation; and, the second half is even better and more interesting sonically. The balance and symmetry of this album is remarkable. Think about the placement of the two acoustic tracks, \\"Us Against The World\\" (Edit: also easily one of the finest things they've ever done) and \\"U.F.O.,\\" and also \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\" and \\"Don't Let It Break Your Heart\\" and their respective lead-in instrumental tracks. The flow of this album is likewise remarkable. Don't skip a single track -- listen to it straight through in its entirety. I don't know that I hear any narrative strand meandering throughout, but it plays as one 44-minute song.  \\"Hurts Like Heaven\\" and \\"Up With The Birds\\" (Does anyone else hear a glimmer of The Beatles' hauntingly beautiful \\"Good Night\\" during the first half of this track?) may be the greatest things Coldplay have ever done -- and are certainly on par with \\"Politik\\" and \\"Amsterdam\\" as the band's finest album opener and closer on the same album to date. If the opening of \\"Mylo Xyloto\\"/\\"Hurts Like Heaven\\" doesn't grab you from the outset and send jolts of ecstatic electricity down your spine and into your toes, you have no pulse. This album does for happiness what Parachutes did for melancholia.  And that's to say nothing of \\"Charlie Brown,\\" \\"Up In Flames\\" (the moving simplicity of this one is stunning, and it sounds like something Michael Jackson might have done in his prime), \\"Paradise,\\" and \\"Princess of China\\" (maybe my favorite track on the album right now however blasphemous that might sound).  In the words of Chris Martin, \\"Open up your eyes.\\" And, I might add, your ears and your heart, too. This is an album pulsating with color and creativity. It's a beautiful, hopeful, life-affirming masterpiece that will stand the test of time, even if it's torn down in ours. (1. Parachutes; 1A. A Rush of Blood to the Head; 1B. Mylo Xyloto)
1400052181|5.0|How did the author take a 60-year-old routine medical procedure and turn it into a story that reads like fiction?  The depth and breadth of research paid off in revealing details of the lives of the Lacks family.  I feel like I know the women and wouldn't want to know some of the men.  I got a glimpse of the lives of Baltimore's poor black families during a time I was growing up in the South.  Once I got started it seemed like I was visiting them every time I picked up the book.  A good read.

0802473164|5.0|This book is a real down to earth genuine guide for living a loving life.  it should be on every man's library shelf, and is worth reading and re-reading over and over again.
B004T5R2HQ|5.0|Works great on my atrix. I use it to scan select textbook pages and diagrams so I can study during short breaks at work.
B002EWD0I6|4.0|We've watched this series on PBS, and think it's one of the best.  The characters are fascinating, the plots well-done.  It's a look into another time and culture.    Don't know why it's so little known.  Bought this for our daughter, who had not seen the TV show.
B0000AUHOH|4.0|I thought this movie was interesting if not laughable but what I can't figure out is if it is supposed to be the worst in the bunch why does it cost more than some of the better ones. This mystery eludes me. Nevertheless if you like Star Trek then get it or have a hole in your collection if you can live with that. I have had this one on vhs for many years so I can live with it until the price drops.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I don't know why this game is so addictive but both my husband and I have spent a lot of time playing it. This is a great time killer app because you can spend just a few seconds at a time on each level so the game is always at a good place to stop( not that you'll want to). Good graphics, lots of levels, works perfect on my Droid incredible. Worth the 99 cents for sure!
B005KAH7QU|4.0|I had never heard of this movie, and in hindsight it would have been fantastic in the theatre.  Interesting story, good acting, appealing cinematography.  It's a film that knows what it is, and does those things well.
B0000640VN|3.0|I'm a Meg Ryan fan so I was disappointed by her performance in this movie.  She's lovely, luminous, but shrill, petulant, rude, stomps around- for me, didn't evince anything that Jackman would admire or find remotely attractive, much less come to love.  I got the feeling that Meg was trying to act as she thinks high-powered female execs do- but if she behaved that way she'd never have gotten past the copy-room (actually, would've been fired).<br /><br />[SPOILER ALERT] What was that all about, her looking for her little pointy thing?  She's a vice-president but doesn't know the word STYLUS?  Not quite as bad as Goldie Hawn in Bird on a Wire, but let's just say that woman-kind wasn't well-served by Ryan's performance.  What was the director looking at?  There's a scene near the end where Ryan walks up to a front door, and without preamble, says \\"You don't seem to understand, I'm trying to blah blah..\\" but those are the first words she's said, she hadn't said anything for them TO misunderstand.  No-one noticed this?<br /><br />I love time travel movies, especially romantic ones, and I do very much like Jackman's performance, dashing and believable, and the central premise, thus, the three stars, and the film is entertaining enough.  But there's so much that's wrong with the script, the direction, the scenes in the hospital detract from the film, for example (who cares?).  Are we not to notice that Meg's dress mysteriously changes (for no particular reason, since it's still not in keeping with the style of the period)?  Plus, I got NO SENSE of chemistry or attraction between the two leads, didn't believe it for a minute.<br /><br />I recommend [[ASIN:B001BLM15O Time After Time]] with Malcolm McDowell and Mary Steenburgen, superior in every way (and you could cut the chemistry with a KNIFE, very sexy, they met on the film and married shortly after).  Or, [[ASIN:B00D3LA6SY Prelude to a Kiss]], in which Meg is wonderful (along with Alec Baldwin), also very romantic and satisfying.

B004DI7HZ6|5.0|One of the best books I've read in a while. Instantly found myself wrapped up in the life of Diana. I couldn't wait to turn the pages and at the same time I didn't want the story to end.  So glad there will be more!

0857685570|5.0|I have purchased 2 other Drew Struzan books (Movie Posters of Drew Struzan and The Art of Drew Struzan) and this book is the best of them! It is double the size of the other books and even includes  personal work he has done which is surprisingly different from his commercial work. I highly recommend this book.
B002CVQAX6|3.0|The Dark Castle production company founded by Robert Zemeckis, Gilbert Adler and Joel Silver churned out a few low-brow horrors at the beginning of the last decade before producing broader, more mainstream flicks like RockNRolla and Unknown. Among the better of these schlockfests was Ghost Ship, a maritime horror set in the bleak Bearing Straight. A salvage crew featuring the underused Gabriel Byrne (replacing Brian Cox) and the lovely Julianna Margulies set out on a mission to find a mysterious floating behemoth only to discover that it's the 40-year lost Antonia Garza, a cruise ship that vanished without a trace.<br /><br />Once on board the salvage crew quickly begin to realize that something sinister is going on and have doubts about the completing their mission. The rusting juggernaut holds a terrifying secret and will not let them leave under any circumstances. It's an ironic morality play with a twist, much in the style of the producers' own Tales from the Crypt TV/movie series. Dark Castle were good at making this type of film, but they've shifted focus in recent years. Despite a little too much CGI blood effects, Ghost Ship still manages to be chilling and provokes a dreadful atmosphere.<br /><br />But where did all the dead bodies go?<br /><br />If you like this film then you ought to check out the similar Death Ship and Deep Rising. Neither will surface on Blu Ray any time soon, but they're worth hunting down.<br /><br />The Blu Ray features a nice 1.78:1 1080p picture with Dolby TrueHD sound. A fair amount of extras are included.
1582701709|1.0|I loathe the day this book got published. Ever since this book got printed I have been hearing about it nonstop. Oprah, my friends, family members, etc. This book is a total piece of crap. And yes, before you criticize me for not reading it, I saw the movie and that was all of \\"The Secret\\" I needed. It's a hoax people, wake up! This book takes things that are true from different philosophies and religions and markets it into a pop-culture piece of rubbish!   I hate, hate, hate this book.
B004LZFWJO|1.0|This game was fun... for about 60 seconds. Then you realize what you see is what you get... Let down.
B0055SWM08|5.0|first time rating a game... because Quell is worth the effort to rate. It's perfect for a mobile game. Challenging, able to play in short bursts and fun.
B003UESJH4|5.0|This movie is done in a compassionate, excellent way.  It tells the story of how King George VI gained confidence in himself and was able to speak to the British people in their moment of crisis.  Colin Firth, Geoffrey Rush, and Helena Bonham Carter are outstanding actors in this movie and the plot is excellent.  I wont go into the details since it has been written numerous times in past reviews.  I just want to say I know the difficulties that George VI went thru in his life due to his stammering and sometimes stuttering when he talked.  When I was young I had the same problem and thanks to two speech therapists I was able to use strategies in talking and it greatly gained my self confidence.  This movie shows that a huge problem of George VI was he was suffering from low self-esteem due to his father George V and his brother Edward VIII.  Both mocked him and made him feel less of a man and a prince.  Due to George VI speech therapist George was able to control (mostly) his stammering when he had to make speeches to the British people live or on the radio.<br />The root of his stammering problem was due to the harsh mental environment George VI went thru in his younger life, and he didn't realize this until his speech therapist helped him discover that.  I know that feeling, not from my family, but from a few classmates when I was a boy.<br />All the acting in this movie is done with compassion and this is a triumph.<br />Queen Elizabeth II gave her approval of this movie and so it shows that the plot, acting, and accuracy are right on the spot.  I can't recommend this movie highly enough.  Well worth 5 stars and more!!
B005IZLPMY|3.0|The movie on Blue-ray was good, but the regular dvd/digital copy sucked.  Could not copy the digital copy to pc - would not read the dvd version so don't waste your money on it.  Just get the BR version.
B005COO1X6|2.0|I am a big Stephen King fan and was really disappointed by this novella. I wasn't expecting much since novellas are quick reads that don't usually set up a lot of plot, but come on man.  This is something that left me scratching my head.  It started off with so much promise but just took a sidetrack once the car pulled into the abandoned lot. It almost seems that this was thrown together to help get some interest in his new book.  I must say \\"11/22/63\\" does seem to be promising.
B004LZFWJO|2.0|FC on my dx.. As boring and useless as an Obama speech. Don't bother with this one unless you have some far left liberals you'd like to entertain. Also, might be fun for children under the age of five.

B001E45XT4|5.0|I got these head phones earlier this week after my new puppy chewed up my three older cheapo headphones. Let me  just say, these are *AMAZING*. The sound quality is excellent (if a little tinny/hollow/ sometimes without an amplifier), and the voice quality is excellent (my wow guild noticed right away that I had a new gaming headset), IF people can hear you. For some reason, some people have mentioned an issue hearing me, because the microphone is so far from my mouth. But, I've found that speaking up, (I'm usually a bit mousy quiet) can help. May have to adjust the sensitivity. They're very comfortable, though. not too crazy. Earbuds hurt my ears, so I stick with these. And as another poster mentioned, it's great pretending you can't hear anyone. XD
B0055SWM08|5.0|Beautifully made, with a nice asthetic and just the right challenge level. easy recommendation. the music and graphics are soothing and really help set a great vibe to the game.
